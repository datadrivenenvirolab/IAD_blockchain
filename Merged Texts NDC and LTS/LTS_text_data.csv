against climate change introduction in recent years andorra has endowed itself with a set of resources and instruments to demonstrate its willingness to support the international commitments acquired in 2015 under the paris agreement  it is therefore necessary to encourage companies to implement environmental management systems within the framework of their corporate responsibility integrating ghg emissions and therefore energy efficiency into their operations and including these voluntary systems in the criteria for assessing public tenders or providing tools for calculating ghg emissions within organisations such as the dissemination of the simplified emission calculation tool that the government provides free of charge  in addition according to the litecc the administrations public entities and companies with more than one hundred workers must have a sustainable mobility plan for their workers according to the hierarchical criteria mentioned above  the development of hfcs was a consequence of the montreal protocol as a 6response by the chemical companies to address the ban on the use of ozone-depleting cfcs and hcfcs  the implementation of this system is key to supporting organisations entities and companies within the framework of social corporate and entrepreneurial responsibility as it facilitates the offsetting of their carbon footprint and the approval of policies to combat climate change in its operation  similarly the articulation of a national ghg emission offset system can serve to encourage and coordinate disperse activities related to the environment to be conducted by institutions and companies  it will therefore be necessary to ensure the quality and reliability of the energy supply by means of a regulation that determines the criteria to identify users who are liable to suffer from energy insecurity and to provide information to companies and entities within the energysect on how to act in the above cases  similarly to deploy the litecc it will be vital to obtain the collaboration of the different agents from the public and private sectors and formalise said collaboration by means of cooperation agreements if deemed necessary in this respect there are currently several working groups involved in the area of mitigation such as the one that focuses on energy efficiency in buildings with the participation of the andorran association of architects and the andorran association of engineers and the one that focuses on vocational training in the energy field with the participation of the association of electric plumbing and air conditioning companies and the andorran association of engineers 6 is forecast in the 2071-2100 horizon quality and quantity 176 hm3/year in relation to the 1961-1990 period 282 hm3/year

event that the supply companies increase the charges associated with the an increase in the costs of treating the water to make it drinkable treatment of water to ensure its quality -vulnerability of the ecological state of the aquatic systems due to the decrease in the quantity and quality of the water -vulnerability of the health and well-being of the population to extreme health 4 climatic phenomena such as heatwaves natural risks associated with climate change etc  similarly the issuance of green bonds that seek to implement projects for climate change mitigation or adaptation by public and private institutions that are qualified to manage them must allow funding to be obtained from investors interested in carrying out plans that would be more difficult to execute without this fiscal mechanism  according to the data for 20177 about 600 gg co -equivalent are emitted in andorra and the 2countrys sinks absorb 23 of them the sink capacity of the forest mass is almost -140 gg co -2equivalent/year  despite the fact that the energysect remains the main source of ghg emissions chart 4 the forests capacity to absorb ghg emissions accounts for almost 40 of the emissions actually generated in the country  if the global situation and the technology available in the future make a reduction beyond this commitment possible the achievement of a more ambitious fall will be pursued with the aim of reducing emissions below the territorys sink capacity  agriculture and forest management respectful towards the territorys sink capacity 4  therefore in order to achieve carbon neutrality the strategy includes agricultural and forestry management to ensure the maintenance and improvement of the countrys sink capacity  agriculture and forest management respectful towards the territorys sink capacity the agricultural and livestock farming sectors account for less than 2 of the total ghgs 2017 so actions in this sector are not aimed at mitigation but rather at promoting production to boost the consumption of local food and thus reduce food waste and emissions associated with food transport  19 / 53 the long-term strategy on energy and climate change 2020-2050 principalitys sink capacity is a key element within the actions to be implemented as part of the strategy  in this regard the sectoral plan for energy infrastructures in andorra also provides for the use of biomass energy by means of these forest management plans and considers that the management must ensure their maintenance and improve the sink capacity  in any event the current sink capacity of the territory is calculated upon the basis of the available data and variables often national bibliographic sources or other from nearby territories which outline the most representative scenario of andorras forest mass  within the framework of the drawing up of the national ghg inventory and in accordance with the guidelines of the ipcc of 2006 this estimate must be continuously improved and therefore it will be necessary to make a systematic observation of the variables that are determined essential to better allocate the principalitys sink capacity  2identifying the factors that condition the sink capacity of the forest mass and defining the management criteria to be integrated into the different management tools for these areas to optimise said factors are key to improving ghg absorption  similarly the use of rainwater is also an important element to be borne in mind for the maintenance and management of these spaces given the potential scarcity of this resource in the future  these bonds must also comply with the transparency and publicity guidelines required for carbon credits and 100 renewable energy certificates  educational transition the educational transition must permit the drawing up and implementation of training and educational actions in the fields of climate change and energy particularly with a view to disseminating the available information on the effect of social positioning on all the socio-economic sectors and biodiversity and the associated ecosystem services and the capacity for future adaptation with the purpose of enhancing the citizenrys knowledge to facilitate conscious decision-making  one of the lines of research regarded as a priority is the optimisation of the sink capacity of different ecosystems in the country taking into account the integration of their ecosystem values and the climate neutrality goal which is set  the set of results must be transferred in a streamlined way between the actors with planning capacity and the researchers and this information must also reach society as a whole in an understandable and useful manner in such a way that an information exchange platform is promoted to bring the research studies closer to the territorys real mitigation and adaptation needs  one of the key variables for achieving the strategys goals is the improvement of the estimate of the territorys sink

projects for climate change mitigation or adaptation by public and private institutions that are qualified to manage them must allow funding to be obtained from investors interested in carrying out plans that would be more difficult to execute without this fiscal mechanism  however in order for the social transition to be real and close to the needs and concerns of society the programme includes the participation of the different actors in the process to achieve carbon neutrality and ensures that there is institutional reinforcement and the structure and resources required to ensure its functionality  to design these training programmes it will be vital to collaborate with the countrys higher education institutions in order to create ones that abide by the principles of the ehea student-centred learning and programmes defined by competences and learning outcomes measured in accordance with the european credit transfer and accumulation system ects and quality standards  furthermore within the administration the development of the tools plans and programmes for the mitigation of and adaptation to climate change will require updated and enhanced institutional and vocational training in order to develop new skills such as planning in accordance with unstable climate scenarios and apply institutional adjustments to facilitate the implementation of the identified measures  there is also the working group involved in the area of adaptation made up of research institutions from the country such as the institute for andorran studies  this legislative tool will institutionally enhance the management of the systematic observation required to sustain the inventory a basic tool for steering the mitigation actions to be implemented  to implement these tasks it will be necessary to obtain the collaboration and cooperation of administrative and research institutions both domestic ones and others from neighbouring countries and abroad one key example of the above is the close collaboration with the centre for snow and mountain studies of andorra cenma through the monitoring committee of the agreement between the institute for andorran studies and the oecc which should permit the organisation of the working groups required to plan and carry out the systematic observation of climate change together with the collaboration with the same institutions centre for sociological research cres so as to obtain information on the perception of the effects of climatic change and the populations anxiety in this matter 001 in 2017 the long-term on energy and climate change must set the path towards implementing firm decisive and immediate climate action that integrates the initiatives required to achieve a territory which is more resilient to this climate challenge  this issue is particularly sensitive in a territory such as andorra due to the multi-sectoral nature of the uses of this resource  moreover the forestry and other land use sector absorbs approximately 23 of the emissions generated while the countrys forest mass which covers 40 of the territorys surface area is the chief absorber of these emissions -140 gg co /year  therefore the management of the energysect and the forest mass within the territory gives rise to two key elements of andorras contribution to the fight against climate change  the commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 is a highly ambitious goal given the current ghg emissions within the territory although it is regarded as a minimum commitment objective to be achieved  if the global situation and the technology available in the future make a reduction beyond this commitment possible the achievement of a more ambitious fall will be pursued with the aim of reducing emissions below the territorys sink capacity  agriculture and forest management respectful towards the territorys sink capacity 4  the national energy strategy for the fight against climate change in this regard it is possible to study tools to promote the self-consumption of electric including relocated consumption based on the establishment of an energy transport toll allowing electric to be generated by an owner and consumed at another point in the territory as if it were its own energy in exchange for paying a toll for the cost of transporting the energy to the point of consumption  agriculture and forest management respectful towards the territorys sink capacity the agricultural and livestock farming sectors account for less than 2 of the total ghgs 2017 so actions in this sector are not aimed at mitigation but rather at promoting production to boost the consumption of local food and thus reduce food waste and emissions associated with food transport  in any event the current sink capacity of the territory is calculated upon the basis of the available data and variables often national bibliographic sources or other from nearby territories which outline the most representative scenario of andorras forest mass  support the actors from the territory in the event of watershortage and droughts 4  adaptation cycle under the climate change regime of the united nations17 for the implementation of the paacc the impacts of climate change on the territory of the principality were identified upon the basis of previous scientific work carried out in andorra and the pyrenees as a whole within the framework of the cooperation project of the pyrenean climate change observatory opcc18  to ensure that the adaptation measures are consistent and suited to the real and foreseen changes in the territory its necessary to continue studying the impact and vulnerability in terms of climate change and to identify and calculate the indicators required to monitor it properly  the traditional extensive livestock farming system developed in the principality has a positive impact on the territory because it indirectly contributes to the cleaning of the forests and mountains thus minimising the risk of fires and promoting biodiversity  to ensure that the transfer of all the information generated by this programme is useful and practical it will be essential to anticipate how the results will be disclosed and how the different players that implement and execute the mitigation and adaptation initiatives within the territory will be involved  the set of results must be transferred in a streamlined way between the actors with planning capacity and the researchers and this information must also reach society as a whole in an understandable and useful manner in such a way that an information exchange platform is promoted to bring the research studies closer to the territorys real mitigation and adaptation needs  one of the key variables for achieving the strategys

a canadian company is developing a novel fusion reactor that could unlock large amounts of energy from hydrogen a near-infinitely abundant resource on earth in a process that would not generate any long-lived radioactive waste and entails no risk of a meltdown  company profits are transferred to the communities  recently the toronto hydro companys compressed air energy storage pilot project was deployed in lake ontario and now provides 1 mw of storage capacity that can be sent to the city grid during peak demand times  other initiatives such as a fully electrified taxi company have been developed for example in montréal by téo taxi another company communauto north americas oldest and largest car-sharing company has recently announced its purchase of 600 hybrid-electric or fully electric vehicles  however in 2008 sbc case industries papabravos parent company initiated an r&d project to develop electric vehicles for use in potash mines  the company was able to develop many vehicles such as the marmot-ev and a second-generation truck able to function in environments other than potash mines  in this respect a company from prince edward island north atlantic organics ltd  technology innovation often faces a so-called valley of death which typically appears at the pre-commercialisation stage where the conversion 9 6 canada has confirmed its commitment of a proven concept into a compelling product will to clean energy innovation by joining determine whether a company will survive or not  the roadmap states that canadas future prosperity depends on data analysed in the 2016 canadian clean the investment choices we make today and that technology industry report published by analytica the development of clean infrastructures will offer advisors suggests that the canadian clean substantial economic opportunities for canadian technology sector has grown considerably over companies many of which are already among the the last decade and that a pathway toward leaders in energy technology water infrastructure decarbonisation would further stimulate the sector by and transportation innovation  nevertheless the report also highlights community dlsc integrates solar thermal energy to that these same canadian companies are losing its district system to store significant amount energy market share world-wide and that moving swiftly underground during the summer so it can be used towards decarbonisation could provide significant in the winter for space heating  already the costs of lithium ion batteries are being significantly reduced by the production of electric transportation companies such as tesla motors  canada is well placed achieve considerably greater emissions reductions in the development of hydrogen and alternative fuels with companies

operating in canada have opted to green their fleet through the use of hybrid-electric vehicles or fully electric vehicles  for couriers and other shipping companies fleet management and fuel use has a major impact on operating costs and is constantly being reviewed to minimise costs and increase performance  some companies have opted for electric vehicle technology for both economic and environmental benefits  although information gaps appear to be an important barrier to adoption of electric vehicles by small and medium enterprises several companies are providing support services to demonstrate the business case for greening vehicle fleets  the results of these trials will inform the permanent use of low-carbon fuels at the bath plant and could be used by other companies in the cement industry  many companies face global for coal or coke or as a feedstock in other sectors  moreover these companies may face reduction potential estimated by the iea from additional challenges associated with decreasing four types of industrial ghg emissions reductions global demand for their goods in the future as technologies for ieas low-demand and high-demand governments act to mitigate ghg emissions 6 nevertheless there remain challenges benefits to companies that can improve processes in reducing emissions from some sectors and technologies to reduce emissions canadas mid-century

128 this represents a significant opportunity for 9 3 further investments in rd&d and innovation canadian clean technology companies to tap into in clean technology combined with this growing market  for countries barriers to investment such as higher example carbon pricing allows for the consideration perceived risk and imperfect information prevent of ghg emissions in the final price of a product which these opportunities from being realised by canadian provides a market value to the environmental benefits companies  commitment canada will contribute to making other types of approaches such as government these investments more accessible to canadian procurement of clean technologies and regulations companies allowing for canadian low-carbon could also increase demand for canadian clean technologies to help reduce emissions at a lower cost technologies  for this to happen there must be companies to export untested products  industrial ecology seeks to emulate of companies  many

into innovative solutions to reduce congestion on their roadways  for example the city of edmonton is one of two canadian cities taking part in a north american program aimed at developing connected vehicle technology 64 this technology can improve many elements of transportation in cities by preventing collisions between cars by guiding drivers through detours when there is a slowdown or an accident on the road and even adjusting traffic lights along the detour routes to minimise congestion  other technological advances are leading to autonomous vehicles and greater use of vehicle sharing which stand to have important impacts of the future movement of people within cities  technological advances also help pave the way for new management approach by cities and governments such

" dkk 25 million to introduce a deduction in the tax basis for green company cars to reduce the price of green driving to and from work  box 12 examples of independent business sector initiatives the government has made an agreement with aalborg portland for the company to reduce its emissions by 660000 tonnes of co2e up to 2030  con-version to gas also requires it to be available to the company and the companys location must therefore facilitate connection to the gas grid  dkk 25 million for introducing a deduction in the tax basis for green company cars to reduce the price of green driving on the job  the theme green and sustainable business presents clear and relevant information on how businesses can embark on the green transition such as guidance with easy steps to become more climate-friendly case scenarios from other companies that have introduced climate-oriented initiatives and circular business models and specific examples of how the company can improve the efficiency of its energy consumption or reduce material waste  the effort to secure ambitious cost-effective climate regulation in the eu and globally thus contributes to both reducing global greenhouse gas emissions and achieving the national targets set out in the climate act among other things because com-mon eu regulation ensures equal competitive conditions for danish and other eu-ropean companies and safeguards long-term framework conditions  at the same time denmark is advocating a high level of ambition in international climate regula-tion which will minimise the risk of danish companies and jobs relocating to coun-tries with lower climate ambitions see chapter 8  it will facilitate loan raising and equity financing for green entrepreneurs and growth companies to support the com-panies development and convert good green ideas into green jobs  vaekstfonden will mainly invest in funds and directly in companies but can also provide loan financing  dkk 14 billion will be earmarked for ekf denmarks ex-port credit agency to strengthen ekfs guarantees for danish companies exports of green tech-nologies and solutions to the entire world  the fund offers loans and guar-antees to private companies social housing organisations and public undertakings and institu-tions etc  ifu offers advice and venture capital to companies that want to do business in developing countries and emerging markets  an analysis will be con-ducted to identify potentials and barriers to phasing out fossil fuels in industries including the parts of the companies consumption of energy for processing purposes where possibilities of phasing out fossil fuel are currently limited e  a european focus on green gases and their reconversion can accelerate technological development upscaling and price reductions of green solutions for the benefit of danish companies and the national green transition  the government supports the establishment of standardised methods for efficiently collecting and sharing data between companies throughout the supply chain with a view to supporting their data-based business development possibilities and a common single market for secondary raw materials  the 2020 finance act agreement allocated dkk 100 million to establish a climate forest fund enabling companies and individuals to contribute to the reduction effort  danish companies compete with foreign enterprises and measures in denmark which is why there is risk of moving emissions abroad if they entail dis-proportionately high costs for the sector  this means that we must take decisions now and invest in long-term frameworks for the green transition that will have an impact later on in terms of incentivising 57 conversion as and when companies and consumers need to reinvest in new forms of heating modes of transport process technologies etc  this happens when a measure imposes higher costs on companies and they choose to move their production abroad  the utilities sector of today can generate energy with far lower emissions and companies and households have improved their energy-utilisation efficiency thus saving energy 3 future export potential the danish wind turbine industry is a good example of how the green transition can provide scope for new business opportunities in which companies become increas-ing experienced in utilising and commercialising green technologies  the forum will discuss specific paths to achieving greenhouse gas emission reductions through business-community ini-tiatives and policy action and discuss the business potential for danish green-sec-tor companies  green business forum meets semi-annually and its members in-clude a wide range of directors and chairpersons from leading danish companies and professional bodies and a wide selection of government representatives  in this connection several companies have launched initiatives to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and invest massively in the green transition see box 12  this includes aalborg portland which recently became the first of a number of companies to enter into a cooperation agreement with the government on signifi-cantly reducing its emissions  66 collaboration on a common method for specifying greenhouse gas emissions based on a volun-tary quantitative model for the financial sector can compute the climate impact of the activities it finances in danish companies etc  at the same time common eu regulation ensures a level 67 playing field and reduces the risk of companies and jobs moving abroad and thus moving emissions from one country to another  this will facilitate loan-raising and equity financing for green entrepreneurs and growth companies to support the companies development and convert good green ideas into green jobs  vaekstfonden will mainly invest in funds and directly in companies but can also provide loan financing  73 ekf denmarks export credit agency dkk 14 billion for ekf must be used to strengthen ekfs scope for guaranteeing of danish companies exports of green technologies and solutions all over the world  the fund provides loans and guarantees to private-sector companies social housing organisations and public-sector undertakings and institutions etc  ifu provides advice and venture capital to companies seeking to do business in developing countries and emerging markets  as a rule denmarks green future fund will always seek co-financing with private-sector operators such as pension companies venture capital funds or business angels  this means that the future fund will also mobilise significant private capital funding resulting in an overall boost for the green capital ecosystem and making it easier for green companies and projects to obtain funding  companies with limited alternatives will primarily reduce their produc-tion for instance meaning that jobs and emissions will move abroad  this makes it essential to introduce the green transition gradually so private individ-uals and companies can adapt to the new initiatives such as a restructuring of the tax system  it should also be added that in relation to phasing out of gas boilers the time frame for the phase-out will have a profound impact on the remaining gas customers mainly manufacturing companies  this entails enormous potential exports for danish companies  internal industry transport at the companies also offers electrification opportunities  88 box 26 accelerated transition of industrial activities there is currently only a limited number of manufacturing companies 10-15 that still use coal in their pro-duction 1 million tonnes of co2 for manufacturing companies and 0  many of the companies using coal require high-temperature heat so conversion to power through heat pumps is not an alternative  ensuring a level playing field for companies across borders is thus key for promoting ambitious international regulations in the climate area  an analysis will be conducted to identify potentials and barriers to phasing out fossil fuels in in-dustries including the segments of companies that use energy for processing purposes where the possibilities of phasing out fossil fuel is currently limited e  however electrifying the production process entails large costs for both the state and the companies  the companies will incur costs for technical modifications at their facilities  carbon capture and storage or use is an efficient societal tool for achieving den-marks climate objectives but the companies that may be able to use the technol-ogy lack a personal finance incentive to do so  the objective of the ccus mission is for scientists companies authorities and other parties to join forces in developing cost-effective solutions for carbon capture and storage that can potentially provide reductions negative emissions and carbon for new climate-neutral materials such as textiles and aviation fuels  a european focus on green gases and their reconversion can accelerate technological developments up-scaling and price reductions of green solutions to the benefit of danish companies and support the national green transition  danish companies are leaders in energy

and wastewater companies stronger incentives to utilise their own resources effectively for the benefit of consumers for instance in relation to degasification  the government supports the establishment of standardised methods for efficient collection and sharing of data between companies throughout the supply chain with a view to supporting their data-based business development possibilities and supporting a common single market for secondary raw materials  the shipping sector is characterised by its global nature where shipping companies can freely choose the flag of registration for their vessels and change routes and ports of call on grounds of competition which requires interna-tional regulation  afforestation the 2020 finance act agreement allocates dkk 100 million to establish a climate forest fund en-abling companies and individuals to contribute to the reduction effort  initiatives to boost climate-friendly behaviour in companies several climate partnerships indicated that companies climate-friendly behaviour must be strengthened and transparency about this can also influence consumer behaviour positively  the government will ensure good framework conditions that 134 support companies transition to a green circular economy and support the compa-nies utilisation of the commercial potential nationally in the eu and globally by developing new products services and business models for instance  the theme is a digital guidance universe that compiles information about the green transition tar-geted at companies  the theme aims to promote the green transition in companies throughout denmark by motivating smes in particular to integrate green and circu-lar climate-oriented initiatives in all parts of their business  the theme green and sustainable business presents clear and relevant information on how businesses can embark on the green transition such as guidance with easy steps to become more climate-friendly case scenarios from other companies that have introduced climate-oriented initiatives and circular business models and specific examples of how the company can improve the efficiency of its energy consumption or reduce material waste  initiatives to strengthen behavioural research the governments green research strategy furthermore addresses the need to enhance knowledge of sustainable

sas copenhagen airports and dfds have teamed up to establish a historical large-scale hydrogen plant with a capacity of up to 1  however it is assessed that there will still be a need to expand re capacity in addition to already agreed in-itiatives as societys demand for electric is expected to increase considerably due to increased electrification conversion to green alternative fuels and increased prevalence of major power consumers e  the total expansion of 6 gw is three times larger than denmarks current offshore wind capacity  this is a twentyfold increase of the current capacity

generating hydrogen and e-fuels  - shell and everfuel are behind the hysynergy project on a large-scale ptx plant at fredericia refinery up to 1 gw electrolysis capacity  there are two main barriers to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from waste in-cineration today 1 the existing framework conditions in the sector have resulted in significant excess capacity for waste incineration and hampered investments in re-cycling plants and 2 not enough waste is sorted out for recycling and too much is sent for incineration partly because the municipalities currently have different col-lection schemes which result in small and varied waste flows for recycling  there are also a number of initiatives for increased and streamlined waste sorting increased recycling and adjustment of incineration capacity see box 31  less incineration and less import of waste for incineration the capacity of danish incineration plants must be reduced to match denmarks volume of waste which is expected to decrease as the danes begin sorting more waste for recycling  for that reason the emissions can be reduced partly by adjusting the capacity at the waste incineration plants to the volume of national waste and partly by reducing the amount of waste and sort-ing more waste including plastic in order to increase recycling  therefore denmark supports more ambitious goals for the recycling of plastic and the financing of recycling capacity in europe as well as better product designs  both direct electrification and bio-based fuels have different limitations notably in relation to battery capacity

building a decarbonized society in fukushima the accident at the tokyo electric power companys fukushima daiichi nuclear power station in march 2011 caused considerable injury to the people - 64 - of fukushima prefecture and many others  specifically at the time of adoption the company implementing the project will submit a long-term business strategy vision in the relevant field e  in this context the government will facilitate efforts of companies to develop human resources in and out of the company to be engaged in management emphasizing environment and environmental protection and lead a green socio-economic system -- environmental human resources  in industrialsects there exist a number of companies that need fundamental changes in their business models and strategies  since many companies in japan are rooted in localities a comprehensive consideration on transitioning local economies and companies as well as the workforce will be required  against this backdrop the government local authorities and companies as well as financial institutions will work together to provide vocational training to the workforce support for diversification and shifts in business operations support for inviting new business and replacement of the labor force in order to achieve the transition of the workforce to a decarbonized society smoothly and without delay  furthermore the government will support each stakeholder including companies local communities and citizens in sharing awareness for a - 10 - decarbonized society forming a future vision of the society and taking proactive action  in june 2020 keidanren launched challenge zero a new initiative to strongly promote and encourage companies and organizations to take on the challenge of innovation toward the realization of a decarbonized society  by august 2021 188 companies and organizations have joined challenge zero and have announced their specific innovation initiatives  through this initiative they will work on attracting esg investment in companies which will take on the challenge of innovation toward decarbonized society promoting collaboration among various industries academia and the government to create innovations  to raise awareness of the importance of emissions reduction through gvcs both domestically and internationally in november 2018 keidanren released a concept book by compiling cases of efforts by numerous business associations and companies to visualize the reduced amount of co associated to their products and services  company initiatives based on long-term perspectives keidanren has called on its member companies and organizations to consider their own long-term vision and provide information thereof  by july 2021 over 260 companies and organizations have either formulated or are considering the formulation of their long-term vision  for example recently there has been an increasing number of companies that set sbts science based targets focusing on mid-term reduction targets based on scientific evidences in line with the paris agreement and those - 29 - participated in re 10017 aiming to achieve business operations with the 100 usage of electric of renewable energy origin  further investment burden is inevitable so that japanese companies which have a high level of energy-efficiency technology in the world will make energy consumption more efficient for realizing net-zero by 2050  the government will thereby increase the number of - 34 - companies that incorporate decarbonization into corporate management and facilitate wide acceptance in the society  additionally the government aims to reduce co emissions in logistics and distribution by 2reducing redelivery with cooperation among shippers and logistics and deliver - 54 - companies diversification and improved convenience in delivery methods for courier services and improving the environment for active participation of consumers  the government will also promote the use of environmental information for decarbonization by companies and individuals such as the diffusion of methods for understanding ghg emissions throughout the entire supply chain which includes local small and medium-sized enterprises for the environment-conscious products and business activities to be highly valued by society and the market  in order to promote the introduction of renewable energies that coexist with local communities and the natural environment local governments local companies residents and other local entities will take the initiative in introducing renewable energies and promote an environment for consensus building among the locals  in this regard the government aims to smoothly expand the energy resource aggregation business in which the aggregator who make use of technologies like the demand response dr and virtual power plant vpp facilitates the customers in controlling and creating their demands of energy at the request of the retail electric power companies and power transmission and distribution companies who will pay fees for the adjusted demands  in addition by promoting i-construction and other measures such as the wide use of ict construction by small and medium-sized construction companies that are contractors of local governments for constructing works the government will further improve the efficiency of construction and maintenance management and save workforce and labor to cope with the decrease in the number of skilled workers  the government will promote the introduction of local energy companies and the development of the energy system suited to local production for local consumption in order to make the best use of the abundant renewable energy sources rural areas offer which in turn will lead to the vitality and sustainable development of the areas  to accelerate such efforts and give support the recovery of fukushima from the energysect the government prefecture and related companies work together to move forward with the initiatives including the fukushima renewable energy institute aist frea established in 2014  the government will also provide human resource development for local companies related to renewable energy  and undertaking national campaigns for promoting sustainable forest management and wood use such as tree planting and forest management by a wide range of entities including companies and npos the wood use movement to raise awareness about the significance and benefits of wood use for environmental educational health and mental aspects and network buildings among companies and other stakeholders with interests - 68 - in wood use  direct recovery of co from the atmosphere dac direct air capture 2 as regards the technology development for dac direct air capture they are still in the stage of elemental technology development worldwide although western venture companies are accelerating r&d with an eye on commercialization  at present however the global share of japanese companies in solar module shipments has also declined significantly falling to a share of 1  in particular taking advantage of the fact that japanese companies currently account for 70 of the turbines used for geothermal power generation in japan and abroad japan will expand the market and strengthen the competitiveness of its geothermal industry by providing support including financial support to developing countries for the vast amount of undeveloped geothermal development in the world especially in developing countries from the preparation of master plans to exploration exploratory drilling excavation and plant construction together with the worlds top-class power generation systems  a 20 co-firing of ammonia on a calorie basis in one coal-fired thermal power unit would result in a 20 reduction in co emissions and if 20 co-firing were implemented in all coal-2fired thermal power units of japans major electric power companies this would result in a reduction of approximately 10 of co emissions from japans electric 2 power sector  since many of the related industries are dominated by small medium and micro-sized companies the government should aim to create an industrial structure that can positively work toward the realization of carbon neutrality by responding to electrification challenging new fields changing business categories diversifying and fostering cooperation and mergers among companies  it will also support aggressive business transformation and business restructuring to encourage parts suppliers auto dealers maintenance companies and service stations ss which support the local economy to respond to the accelerated shift to electrification  there is a concern that the steady efforts of companies to make the low-carbon transition would not be appropriately evaluated if solely based on the dual categorization of either green or non-green activities  regarding the innovation finance the government has been conducting visualization of enterprises that have been engaged in decarbonization to provide information for investors zero-emission challenge 325 companies as of march 2021 5 trillion yen to support the overseas development of high-quality infrastructure and other overseas business activities by japanese companies toward a decarbonized society  while governments and institutions in japan and abroad are working on various guidelines for sustainable finance there is a growing demand from companies and investors for a comprehensive set of guidelines from a practical perspective  in addition from the perspective of providing information that is highly convenient from the perspective of companies and investors stock exchanges in particular will take the lead in establishing an information infrastructure that includes the provision of market information etc  with regard to sustainability-related disclosure following the revision of japans corporate governance code in june 2021 companies listed on the prime market are encouraged to enhance the quality and quantity of their disclosure based on the task force on climate-related financial disclosure tcfd or an equivalent international framework  in addition japan will promote international cooperation in the field of climate change by discussing climate change issues in developing countries in asia and other countries with various stakeholders including central and local governments private companies and research institutes and identifying local needs for cooperation  for that reason in particularly important fields and projects therein once the public and private sectors share bold and specific goals the government will provide continuous support for companies committed to taking on challenges toward achieving the goals from r&d through demonstration to - 98 - social implementation  based on 2the implementation plan of the green growth strategy and ambitious projects from r&d through demonstration to social implementation by companies that demonstrate their commitment to these targets will be continuously supported for the next 10 years  by creating mechanisms to require a commitment from the top management the governments 2-trillion-yen budget will be used as pump priming to induce private companies to invest approximately 15 trillion yen in r&d and equipment and to move toward ambitious innovation  section 5 tax systems realization of the net-zero by 2050 is a high-set goal and short-term capital investment by companies that is highly effective in achieving the goal needs to be encouraged let alone r&d investment from long-term views  therefore also from the aspect of tax systems the government will strongly push decarbonization investment by companies  taking a special exception to raise the upper limit of tax deduction for loss carried forward targeting companies that are resolutely taking on challenges towards new normal and realization of carbon neutrality even though their business is in the red amid the severe business environment induced by the covid-19 pandemic  in light of accelerated expansion of voluntary credit markets internationally japan will take concrete measures to increase the depth of the domestic market credit market in which carbon reduction value can be traded and thereby promptly respond to the desires of companies that are pioneering climate change measures  furthermore in terms of carbon taxes and emissions trading systems the government will advance professional and technical discussions on whether it is possible to design a system that will promote investment and contribute to growth in terms of both price signaling and revenue generation while taking into account the added cost borne by companies  in business management the government will facilitate companies to incorporate perspectives to appropriately address environmental issues and create new corporate values  in this context the government will facilitate efforts of companies to develop human resources in and out of the company to be engaged in management emphasizing environment and environmental protection and lead a green socio-economic system -- environmental human resources  japan will promote the international expansion of adaptation businesses of japanese companies  against these backgrounds countries in the world including developed countries are beginning to take steps towards decarbonization not only in the areas of technologies but also international rule formulations by striving for rule-making that are conducive to their own industrial structures while businesses are also starting efforts to enhance competitiveness by utilizing decarbonization technologies  in order to accurately grasp the current situation of these businesses and overcome their challenges it is essential to exploit potential of energy efficiency through technological development and to improve economic efficiency by 17 an international initiative that aims to achieve business operations with the 100 usage of electric of renewable energy origin  achieving carbon neutrality in the port and maritime sectors since many industries such as power generation iron and steel and chemical industries accounting for about 60 of japans total co emissions are located 2in ports and coastal areas it is necessary to boost the decarbonization by creating a large demand for hydrogen and fuel ammonia26 for a variety of uses through cooperation among businesses in parallel with expanding hydrogen supply and upgrading port functions in line with decarbonization  with cooperation of related businesses enhancement of efficient logistics networks using technology like automated driving improvement of truck transportation efficiency including advanced logistics systems with cooperation among related businesses using digital technology from the perspective of logistics maas29 and further promotion of modal shifts to shipping and rail  and enhance proactive measures such as transportation disaster prevention management to promote the improvement of disaster response capabilities of transportation businesses  38 a data platform that digitizes port logistics procedures among private businesses port logistics field procedures of the port management bodies port administration field and port infrastructure information from planning to maintenance and management port infrastructure field and handles them in an integrated manner through data coordination the first operation in the port logistics field started on april 1 2021  the fact will have been common that renewable energy businesses and projects which confer a leading role to coexist with and benefit local communities have been diffused into every corner of japan thereby taking a leadership in contributing to the decarbonization in the local regions  in collaboration with citizens and businesses the use of environmentally friendly design products resource saving reusable easy to separate material replacement by recycled materials or bio-based plastics etc  in order to put this commitment - 50 - into practice in the future it will be necessary for the national and local governments businesses financial institutions and the general public to work together to clarify by 2030 the images of each local regions toward decarbonization while mobilizing measures and policies to spread to other local regions through a decarbonization domino effect for implementation  in addition local governments local businesses and financial institutions will play a central role in promoting the development of decarbonization leading areas with the active support of the national government  as for large vehicles over 8 tons the government will aim to introduce 5000 units of electrified vehicles in advance in the 2020s while promoting technological demonstration to develop and promote the use of electrified vehicles suitable for commercial use such as cargo and passenger businesses  the next-generation power management industry includes businesses that utilize and provide values of distributed energy resources ders such as renewable energy fuel cells cogeneration storage batteries and demand-side resources as well as next-generation grid businesses that upgrade the operation of power transmission and distribution systems and form facilities based on the premise of increasing and utilizing ders  it also includes microgrid businesses as a form of fusion of the two in specific regions and in a broader sense businesses that provide platforms such as systems equipment and databases that make these businesses possible  the development of these businesses and industries is expected to bring a variety of benefits to consumers and other electric consumers  - 88 - the direction and major initiatives planned for the time being regarding the expansion of the introduction of ders the support of related businesses and the construction of next-generation grids are also indicated in the basic energy plan  in the future specific discussions and examinations will continue in the advisory committee on natural resources and energy and in practical examination forums in which related businesses etc  in addition for businesses that have been approved for their long-term business plans of 10 years or more a long-term funding mechanism to realize the plans and a results-linked interest subsidy system loan size of 1 trillion yen over three years have been established in the act on strengthening industrial competitiveness act no  98 of 2013 to promote long-term transition initiatives by businesses  in order to link the decarbonization of the regions to the creation of a virtuous cycle between the economy and the environment therein the government should set out a clear vision for the regions and promote esg finance by focusing on the environment economy and society by cooperating with leading regional financial institutions providing them with information sharing know-how and promoting the creation of models for building businesses that make use of regional resources and solving regional problems  amidst globally intensifying competition among businesses for leadership toward a carbon-neutral society in order to maximize the results of each project the following evaluation axes is established based on this policy  grasping climate risks associated with business activities and taking measures and adaptation businesses which provide technologies products and services on adaptation  japan will promote the international expansion of adaptation businesses of japanese companies  currently the industries quantify their own contribution to reduction based on this guidelines and provide information to stakeholders such as investors and consumers  regarding the innovation finance the government has been conducting visualization of enterprises that have been engaged in decarbonization to provide information for investors zero-emission challenge 325 companies as of march 2021  in the future the government will expand the target industrial fields and create opportunities of dialogues for investors enterprises and policymakers to - 94 - call in finance to enterprises working on decarbonization innovation  while governments and institutions in japan and abroad are working on various guidelines for sustainable finance there is a growing demand from companies and investors for a comprehensive set of guidelines from a practical perspective  in addition from the perspective of providing information that is highly convenient from the perspective of companies and investors stock exchanges in particular will take the lead in establishing an information infrastructure that includes the provision of market information etc  the ipcc is an inter-governmental organization in which 195 countries and regions participate  in june 2020 keidanren launched challenge zero a new initiative to strongly promote and encourage companies and organizations to take on the challenge of innovation toward the realization of a decarbonized society  by august 2021 188 companies and organizations have joined challenge zero and have announced their specific innovation initiatives  company initiatives based on long-term perspectives keidanren has called on its member companies and organizations to consider their own long-term vision and provide information thereof  by july 2021 over 260 companies and organizations have either formulated or are considering the formulation of their long-term vision  27 in the international maritime sector the international maritime organization imo has set the goals of reducing the total annual greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping at least 50 by 2050 compared to 2008 and phasing out greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping as soon as possible in this century  in addition with regard to the greener ships such as gas-fueled ships using hydrogen ammonia and others which are essential to achieving zero emissions the government will promote the development and practical use of core technologies such as hydrogen/ ammonia fueled-engines and lead the development of international frameworks including safety standards for hydrogen/ammonia-fueled ships to further accelerate energy saving efforts and decarbonization through the international maritime organization imo  in addition japan will lead the discussion on co emission reduction at the international civil aviation 2organization icao and contribute to the reduction of emissions from international aviation  furthermore there are also numerous other resources such as the culture climate organizations and communities and biodiversity  aircraft industry the international civil aviation organization icao has adopted a goal of no increase in co emissions from international aviation after 2020 and this goal 2will be achieved through a combination of improved flight operations the introduction of new technologies alternative fuels and the use of market mechanisms  where an external organization objectively certificates the eligibility of green bonds etc  in addition the fsa and others will examine the nature of esg evaluation organizations transparency governance etc  also with emerging countries in asia that are especially important from the viewpoint of promoting global decarbonization taking into account relatively large social and economic restrictions of asian emerging countries compared with developed countries japan needs to facilitate them to be committed to decarbonization via more practical approach while cooperating with international organizations such as the international energy agency iea and economic research institute for asean and east asia eria  to this end the government has established a 2 trillion yen green innovation fund and decided to assign the new energy and industrial technology development organization nedo to its operation  - 17 - when promoting the maximum introduction of renewable energy it is necessary to secure grid capacity which connects regions with large renewable energy potential to large consumption areas to deal with the fluctuating output of solar and wind power due to natural conditions and to deal with grid constraints such as maintaining grid stability in emergencies including in power supply dropouts  2 23 a next-generation streetcar system that is friendly to people and the environment and has excellent features in terms of ease of boarding and exiting timeliness speed transportation capacity and comfort by improving the running space and vehicle performance etc  in order to meet the needs of local transportation in central city areas residential complexes with aging populations hilly and mountainous areas remote islands and sightseeing areas and so on the government will promote the introduction of new mobility services such as green slow mobility30 which utilizes electrified vehicles that run at speeds of less than 20 km/h and ultra-compact mobility31  furthermore the government will build a road transport network that increases productivity such as by focusing on the construction of beltways in three metropolitan areas while reducing the load on intra-city roads and reorganizing them into people-friendly road spaces  realizing decarbonization domino effect the commitment to 2050 decarbonization zero carbon city declaration in which only four local governments participated as of october 2019 now engages

watersupply sewerage systems and waste disposal facilities and transportation and energy infrastructures the government will promote energy conservation and make the infrastructures play the role of local energy centers to contribute to reducing co emissions in combination with systems expanding the area of 2their services while consolidating them extending their service life and improving their disaster prevention functions  while the net removals by forests have been decreasing continuously due largely to the maturity of planted forests in order to achieve net-zero by 2050 it is imperative to enhance the capacity of forests as carbon sinks by ensuring a harvest utilize wood and plant after harvest cycle including through sound forestry practices such as appropriate thinning promotion of utilizing wood product sourced from matured planted forests and creation of young forests with vigorous growth after harvest  regarding renewable energy if the thin and lightweight next-generation solar cells which japan has strengths in are put into practical use installing solar panels on the roofs of existing houses and buildings with a small load capacity and on the walls and windows of houses and buildings which are now technically difficult will become possible and the goal to realization will become closer  b reuse recycle and utilization of exhaust gas the government will develop and advance high-performance recyclable materials and recycling technology optimize collecting routes expand installed capacity and further expand reusing and recycling  at the same time through japan environmental week and zero carbon city international forum etc  e leading country in solving problems japan aims to become a leading country in solving problems by sharing and applying the best practices from communities including cities and rural areas  as a result japan has one of the highest installed capacities of solar power per area in major countries  in addition to this the population especially the youth continues to move from rural areas to cities and accelerates a geographical imbalance in the population  furthermore it is important for the cities and rural areas to form a broader network for symbiosis and exchanges complementing and supporting each other with their resources not just in its own community  cities will have become more compact and spacious and bustling walkable spaces will have been created all over the country thereby vehicle-centered spaces shifting to human-centered spaces and comprehensive efforts toward decarbonization kept in progress  shaping carbon-neutral communities a cross-sectoral initiatives to create self-sustaining and decentralized societies in local communities it is important that farming forestry and fishing communities as well as cities will shift to carbon-neutrality by complementing and supporting each other each community is encouraged to make use of its characteristics create a self-sustaining and decentralized society while establishing broader network  the government will promote compact cities the creation of spaces that are comfortable and walkable by combining with the improving pedestrian convenience road system hokomichi and comfort improvement zones and the measures and projects based on the comprehensive urban and regional transportation strategy  furthermore the government will comprehensively promote the area decarbonization in cities through facilitating area-wide energy networks developing and preserving parks and green spaces as carbon sinks using digital technology and mobilizing private finance by supporting private - 57 - urban development that are environmentally friendly to revitalize urban areas and enhancing the social implementation of smart cities  2 figure

consistent with the best available sciences from the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc and others  in particular it is expected that a country like japan trusted worldwide for the quality of industrial products and the high standard of science and technology should contribute globally through the implementation of its long-term strategy  13 relevant government ministries and agencies include the cabinet secretariat ministry of economy trade and industry cabinet office financial services agency ministry of internal affairs and communications ministry of foreign affairs ministry of education culture sports science and technology ministry of agriculture forestry and fisheries ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism and ministry of the environment  the cabinet office has a wide range of responsibilities the economic and social research institute and the secretariat for the promotion of science technology and innovation are in charge of statistics indicators and sections related to the environment innovation strategy  for example recently there has been an increasing number of companies that set sbts science based targets focusing on mid-term reduction targets based on scientific evidences in line with the paris agreement and those - 29 - participated in re 10017 aiming to achieve business operations with the 100 usage of electric of renewable energy origin  for these lifestyle shifts the government will carry out a nationwide campaign to encourage cool choice such as the use of goods and services that contribute to decarbonization while putting together the scientific knowledge citizen science through public involvement  furthermore through behavioral science knowledge including nudge and its integration with advanced technologies such as the ai and iot the government will encourage decarbonizing behavior that can be practiced voluntarily and in an enjoyable way  the government will promote cross-disciplinary r&d including from humanities and social sciences to natural sciences  2 human resource development for innovation in order to create sustained innovations for the virtuous cycle of the economy and the environment and to promote just transition of the workforce smoothly it is important that the government develops and maintain human resources in a wide range of fields starting with science and technology that relate to environment and energy  in addition to this the population especially the youth continues to move from rural areas to cities and accelerates a geographical imbalance in the population  d circular and ecological economy for japan where the population declines and the society ages with fewer children it is important to set a growth strategy to strengthen the vitality of local communities  in particular through activities at unesco schools and other schools the government will work to raise the awareness and interest of children students and teachers in environmental conservation and climate change issues and to ensure the quality of unesco school activities and networks among schools  furthermore the government will support each stakeholder including companies local communities and citizens in sharing awareness for a - 10 - decarbonized society forming a future vision of the society and taking proactive action  at the same time the government will facilitate the shift in minds of japanese citizens at all levels to lead them to take action with capacitbuilding and public awareness campaigns to disseminate and share the knowledge of climate change and specific actions to solve the problem  in collaboration with citizens and businesses the use of environmentally friendly design products resource saving reusable easy to separate material replacement by recycled materials or bio-based plastics etc  for these lifestyle shifts the government will carry out a nationwide campaign to encourage cool choice such as the use of goods and services that contribute to decarbonization while putting together the scientific knowledge citizen science through public involvement  3 lifestyle innovation lifestyle innovation shifting the way of life of each citizen towards sustainability provides a major impact directly and indirectly on climate change through consumer behaviors and the use of fuels energy and resources  in order to make it easier for citizens to choose decarbonizing behaviors the government will promote the visualization of co emissions by using 2technologies such as digitalization and blockchain to quantify and certify the environmental value of products and services  - 55 - a cross-sectoral initiatives to create self-sustaining and decentralized societies in local communities  d circular and ecological economy for japan where the population declines and the society ages with fewer children it is important to set a growth strategy to strengthen the vitality of local communities  the government will also study how to coordinate the use of vehicles roads and existing transportation systems in an integrated manner so that the spread of low-speed driving can be promoted seeking understanding and cooperation of local communities  31 a vehicle for one or two people that is more compact and maneuverable than a car has excellent environmental performance and can be used as a convenient means of transportation in local communities  local communities endowed with diverse resources alongside economic and social challenges are actually suited to become a model of a decarbonized society a bright society with a hope for the future  the fact will have been common that renewable energy businesses and projects which confer a leading role to coexist with and benefit local communities have been diffused into every corner of japan thereby taking a leadership in contributing to the decarbonization in the local regions  commercial vehicles such as trucks and buses as well as motorcycles will have been shifted to evs and fcvs and a business model will have been created that contributes to functioning the supply and demand adjustment of local renewable energy improving resilience of the local communities and forming local circular economy on the basis of utilizing battery-replaceable evs as energy stations  shaping carbon-neutral communities a cross-sectoral initiatives to create self-sustaining and decentralized societies in local communities it is important that farming forestry and fishing communities as well as cities will shift to carbon-neutrality by complementing and supporting each other each community is encouraged to make use of its characteristics create a self-sustaining and decentralized society while establishing broader network  in light of these circumstances in order to further expand the introduction of solar power it is urgent to create a new market in the medium and long term through the development of technology for next-generation solar cells that can be installed in places where it is difficult to install existing silicon solar cells which - 74 - are the mainstream of the market while aiming to expand the amount of solar cells introduced at present based on the premise that the project is implemented by appropriate business operators in harmony with local communities  in addition nature-based solutions nbs such as green infrastructure which makes use of various functions of natural environment and ecosystem-based - 103 - approaches including the one based on forest eba52 and eco-drr53 will have various advantageous effects such as adaptation to climate change such as drr mitigation of climate change through carbon storage generation of various economic social and cultural co-benefits in local communities and

likely to benefit more from adaptation actions have wider social and environmental benefits mainly related to forestry i  these will be shared by both men and women but will benefit women more because they are more engaged in activities linked to natural resources and finally if the lts4cn is matched by equivalent global reductions in emissions there will be very large benefits from reduced

significant environmental economic and social problem of our time  the polluter pays principle environmental responsibility and social fairness the costs of the green transition should be primarily borne by the highest-emitting companies  about 90 of the sectors emission reductions come from reducing landfills 11 in the energy efficiency obligation system the implementation of energy efficiency targets is achieved by involving the market by shared burdening the companies selling electric gas and fuel as a result of which the public repays the renovation costs not in one amount but for several years  the latter include the amount of support for renewables and the cost of co quotas for companies covered by 2the eu ets  at the same time higher quota prices have an incentive to achieve the targets by making pollution a more serious cost factor for companies  electric boats have gained considerable ground in recreational boating in recent years and one of the main drivers of development is the ban on the use of internal combustion engines on our great lakes as a result there are several competitive domestic companies in the market  in addition to the use of renewable energy mainly photovoltaics pv the representatives of the companies drew attention to the need to increase the energy efficiency of production and to save energy and resources circular economy  in addition the development and introduction of new technologies requires the support of companies rdi activities the training of professionals and the future retraining of workers in certain industries e  it should be recognized and awareness should be raised that companies will only be able to meet the tightening standards and societal expectations and new competitive conditions created by the decarbonization transition if they themselves play an active and responsible role in the transition they develop and innovate  stakeholders also support the spread of energy services companies esco-type bank financing in the context of municipalities and companies  through this function the state can direct labor force towards green and clean jobs support domestic companies developing high value-added innovative clean technologies and services i  it is also important 93 that this supportive environment also helps to take advantage of new business and foreign trade opportunities arising from technological developments in order to create high-quality sustainable jobs and increase the competitiveness of companies  the aim of the comprehensive initiative is to enable the capital market to finance investments in environmental sustainability to a greater extent than at present and for green companies to have access to more favorable capital or bond-type resources  the emergence of domestic green bonds and the development of the esg rating of listed companies could change this situation in such a way that it also contributes to the development of investment funds  if the climate and other environmental performance data of large domestic listed companies become more transparent then the green assessment of companies will also become possible thus further helping the desired green capital flow  the sustainable exchange initiative in collaboration with investors regulators and companies can improve sustainability and esg considerations for investments  the voluntary carbon market is gaining ground focusing on synergies with financial and capital markets for example some banks are actively supporting their own carbon-offsetting customers to sell their capacities to ghg emitting companies  large companies outside the eu ets may become increasingly interested in offsetting their own ghg emissions even without a specific regulatory obligation or incentive  in addition to the securitization of bank loans and the issuance of green bonds the goal is to introduce and launch renewable investment funds in order to provide hungarian energy retail savers and companies with a predictable and climate-conscious investment opportunity  launch of the domestic encouraging companies outside the scope of ets to offset voluntary carbon offset their emissions in the country of emission i  this desirable state can be achieved by combining monetary and fiscal policy instruments a in its own regulatory competence the cbh directs the financial sector in the green direction by calibrating prudential regulation with recommendations and warnings without endangering its main tasks specified in the central bank act b the government encourages green financing of banks and capital market participants as well as other market participants companies households etc  in addition to the general public the end-user clientele also includes for example state-owned companies educational institutions local governments and hospitals  numerous food companies are dedicated to develop and further improve plant-based meat alternatives as well as to elaborate technologies to grow meat in laboratories  this means that as many hungarian-owned companies as possible should be present in the market producing and providing world-class products and services with modern and green technology ensuring a secure livelihood for their employees 37 there is also a non-governmental organization in hungary to promote the above goals  in addition to the above the tasks to be performed

ministries and all other relevant stakeholders a project promoting the greening of the domestic capital market was launched in hungary  the sustainable exchange initiative in collaboration with investors regulators and companies can improve sustainability and esg considerations for investments  process of concept development stakeholder engagement and public consultation the ncds was based on a wide stakeholder consultation process involving professional and civil society groups and organizations  through this online event series stakeholders from the privatesect financial institutions and civil society groups including youth organizations provided contributions on the national climate neutrality target and associated challenges opportunities and needs  the most likely scenario points to a reorganization within the industry where the economic performance of the sector will not decline but its fundamentals will gradually change  development policy goals for low ghg agriculture the climate breakfast consultations with representatives of civil society organizations and the industries drew attention to the need to place particular emphasis on the conservation of biodiversity and the promotion of organic farming in sustainable agricultural practices  development policy objectives to preserve the absorption capacity of the lulucf sector during climate breakfast with representatives of civil society organizations and relevant industries it was agreed that forest biomass could contribute to fossil fuel substitution and carbon sequestration through wood products and sustainable forest management  during the stakeholder consultation held under the preparation of this strategy industry and professional organizations affirmed their commitment to prioritize the reuse and recovery of material the reduction of biowaste and organizing the treatment of the small remaining waste  the elaboration of related destination-level practice-oriented climate risk assessment and the development of guidelines aids manuals related training event organization and curriculum development in support of strategic planning in the field of tourism also support these trends  cross cutting policies the entire system of public organizations the society and all sectors of the economy must play their part in the fight against climate change 37 there is

large masses  some of the presented proposals have been included in this chapter of the strategy after consultation with representatives of the financial market and other financial organizations44  the following advantages justify the consideration of setting up a green guarantee institution concentrates green industry expertise within one organization supports the building of the historical experience of financiers this could be helped by the creation of green pilot projects in all industries with the support of the guarantee institution provides free technical and green advice on the investments to be made provides guarantees not only for loans but even green bonds by reducing the risk premium the pricing of the funds covered by the green bond can be improved which indirectly improves the return on the financed investments it also encourages equity placements such as support for green venture capital funds 5  c university innovation ecosystem independent organizational units within higher education institutions that promote the market utilization and technology transfer of scientific results of the university as well as support rdi cooperation between the university and actors of the business sector  there is also a strong need for investment in the lulucf sector to maintain and increase post-2030 co sequestration in particular measures to improve the adaptive 2capacity of forests reduce logging in the medium term and increase afforestation in the long term  in addition due to the high degree of electrification which occurs in all areas of the energy sectorincluding the building transport and industrialsectsmore than 10 gigawatts gw of renewable power 34 plant capacity are needed which requires a similar amount of energy storage battery capacity for smooth operation  in addition to climate-friendly carbon-free electric generation the use of this technology is also needed because it has the only additional removal capacity  there is a need for a large-scale deployment of clean renewable technology with a capacity of more than 10 gw to meet the significant increased demand for electric by mid-century  how hungary and the hungarian automotive sector can and will remain competitive in this currently changing environment depends to a large extent on increasing hungarys innovation capacity including knowledge and its willingness to restructure  achieving the 2050 climate neutrality target and meeting consumption will require around 65 gw of clean generation capacity in addition to nuclear capacity  54 source eurostat own modeling figure 33 composition of installed electric capacities in the bau and ea scenarios with the build-up of new renewable energy generation capacities it will also be necessary to build storage capacity from 2040 onward for the system to have sufficient flexible capacity  electric storage capacities in 2050 in the ea scenario will amount to tens of gigawatts of capacity  in 2050 due to the significant renewable energy production capacity and the available storage capacity domestic production will almost completely cover consumption hiba a hivatkozási forrás nem található  2absorption capacity of our forests  development policy objectives to preserve the absorption capacity of the lulucf sector during climate breakfast with representatives of civil society organizations and relevant industries it was agreed that forest biomass could contribute to fossil fuel substitution and carbon sequestration through wood products and sustainable forest management  gradual change of management in order to preserve the absorption capacity and biodiversity of forests gradual transition from felling to perennial forest management in close-to-nature forests and in forests of native tree species where justified and feasible  links with agricultural and rural development policies among the forestry policies of the hungarian rural development program there are a number of measures that help forests to adapt to climate change and increase their carbon sequestration capacity  emissions from the forest area - areas registered as forest parcels free-range forests in the national forest stock database as well as woody plantations and other forest tree species meeting forest definitions in accordance with international forest definitions are calculated by the model as the sum of 1 forest emissions using the forest stock and the emission factor for the forest area 2 the decrease in carbon sequestration due to tree aging and 3 the increase in carbon sequestration capacity due to afforestation  current recovery capacity is low in regional job creation potential  significant absorption capacity of agriculture for there is no qualitative development of previously compost  emissions from wastewater treatment has also declined which is explained by the increasing number of dwellings connected to the public sewer and the increasing capacity of closed sludge fermenters built at larger wastewater treatment plants  60 incinerator capacity is required 4 billion - investments related to the reduction of emissions from agriculture including animal husbandry crop production and soil cultivation huf 745 billion - development of the waste management sector and promotion of the circular economy huf 480 billion - modernization of industrial production processes increase of production efficiency huf 129 billion - increasing the co sequestration capacity of the lulucf sector huf 964 billion  improving the sink capacity of the soil integrated plant management and innovative use of agricultural waste  53 figure 33 composition of installed electric capacities in the bau and ea scenarios  to outline the long-term trajectory an integrated modeling approach was used to explore the specificities of the sectors as well as the system-wide and cross-sectoral dynamics of the decarbonization process  natural sink capacities will be expanded to balance out the remaining emissions in 2050  consequently drastic changes are needed to decarbonize hungarys energy supply system including 10 energy generation capacities and to enable the end-user side to reduce energy consumption and utilize clean energy technologies  to achieve net zero ghg emissions by 2050 based on currently available technological developments efforts are needed in the following areas 1 energy efficiency improvement in all fields of the national economy and establishment of a circular economy 2 electrification in all areas of the economy based on domestic nuclear and renewable energy sources 3 application of ccus technologies in the energysect and in high emitting industrial facilities 4 use of hydrogen and upscaling of the related hydrogen technologies 12 5 sustainable

advantage  to outline the long-term trajectory an integrated modeling approach was used to explore the specificities of the sectors and the system-wide and cross-sectoral dynamics of the decarbonization process the gem is an intersectoral model that uses systems thinking and system dynamics as its foundations  these investments will be needed mainly to build clean energy production capacities close end-of-life power plants and industrial facilities renovate existing buildings and build new energy-efficient buildings and develop electric transport infrastructure  as intraday variable weather-dependent renewable electric generation and daily peak consumption do not match significant electric storage primarily battery technology capacities will need to be built  this reduction in emissions occurs precisely in the most problematic densely populated urban areas and therefore greatly improves the health quality of life and livability of cities living there  it is also important to note that in accordance with the principle of sustainable land use brownfield sites should be given priority in connection with the installation of renewable energy production capacities especially solar panels  54 source eurostat own modeling figure 33 composition of installed electric capacities in the bau and ea scenarios with the build-up of new renewable energy generation capacities it will also be necessary to build storage capacity from 2040 onward for the system to have sufficient flexible capacity  electric storage capacities in 2050 in the ea scenario will amount to tens of gigawatts of capacity  the management capacities required to meet the strengthening the innovation linkages between circular economy objectives are not fully available  without

market table 9 swot analysis of the wastesect ghg emission trends since hungarys accession to the eu significant progress has been made in the field of waste management which led to ghg reductions in the sector  in addition to central mechanized composting plants it is also very important to increase residential composting capacities  this can be attributed to the replacement and average investment costs of the equipment needed for the transformation construction of incineration and pre-treatment capacities while operating costs are already declining  investments related to the decarbonization of the energysect clean energy infrastructure and increased renewable energy capacities can create an additional net 41000 ea scenario and 38000 la scenario direct jobs by 2050 compared to the bau scenario  the result of low carbon investments is reduced energy use waste creation and the increase of natural sink capacities which represent progress towards responsible production and consumption sdg12 as well as towards sustainable cities and communities sdg11  registering planned expansion and quality development of green spaces to improve adaptability and strengthen absorption capacities locally is a key task  the voluntary carbon market is gaining ground focusing on synergies with financial and capital markets for example some banks are actively supporting their own carbon-offsetting customers to sell their capacities to ghg emitting companies  research development and innovation achieving climate neutrality requires a long-term reduction in ghg emissions and an increase in sink capacities at a rate which is currently not possible with existing technologies or achievable at excessive costs or only feasible with radical lifestyle changes that are disproportionate to the pursued goal  furthermore the integration of energy capacities is a key task which demands a smarter more resilient and flexible electric network that can adopt to necessary weather-dependent capacities  it is essential to extend renewable energy sources as well as nuclear capacities to achieve the climate neutrality target  many technologies have reached the level of early application and have become more cost efficient which contributes to the expansion of renewable energy capacities  according to data from the international renewable energy agency irena renewable capacities accounted for 72 of the total new capacities in 2019  since hungary has limited capacities to store carbon the utilization of captured co should be primarily in focus when applying ccus technologies  measures such as retraining programs enhanced university and education curricula as well as supporting and improving green innovations and entrepreneurship by making it easier to create green businesseswith incubation serviceswill ensure a just transition  c university innovation ecosystem independent organizational units within higher education institutions that

building retrofitting are most often not taken into account by financial market participants i  the establishment of a dedicated green guarantee institution will ensure a targeted conscious expansion of green funding  the importance of the guarantee institution continues to grow during the downturn caused by the covid-19 pandemic due to its countercyclical operation it is excellent for green economic stimulus counterbalancing banks risk-averse strategies and financing green investments of under-collateralised customers  as the introduction of an energy efficiency obligation scheme is an important tool in the ncds in which esco-based financing can be a key the relationship between escos and the guarantee institution is as follows prospective public utility obligors of the obligation system are typically more creditworthy have cheaper access to funding than their end-users but at the same time operate with strained liquidity so the planned cash flow is very important for them  based on the default rate of the utilities customers the extent of the guarantee required by the guarantee institution for the entire portfolio can be calculated  in addition to the general public the end-user clientele also includes for example state-owned companies educational institutions local governments and hospitals  the following advantages justify the consideration of setting up a green guarantee institution concentrates green industry expertise within one organization supports the building of the historical experience of financiers this could be helped by the creation of green pilot projects in all industries with the support of the guarantee institution provides free technical and green advice on the investments to be made provides guarantees not only for loans but even green bonds by reducing the risk premium the pricing of the funds covered by the green bond can be improved which indirectly improves the return on the financed investments it also encourages equity

description businesses need planning legal and investment certainty in order to make investment decisions for example to transition to climate-friendly systems and to avoid being locked into fossil fuels through investments and thus having a negative impact on the climate  the public authorities should ensure that energy-intensive companies remain internationally competitive  there is no doubt that a well-functioning and integrated energy market is key for enabling the generation of large quantities of electric from renewable sources and integrating them into the grid in a cost-efficient manner while maintaining competitiveness affordability for businesses and households and the security of the energy supply  the implementation of innovative transport and mobility solutions has improved access to climate-friendly mobility for all groups of population and ensures the efficient connection of all businesses in a decarbonised transport system 6 district heating/cooling and waste heat supplying buildings and businesses with efficient district heating generated from renewable sources will continue to play an important role especially in urban areas  as well as combined heat and power generation feeding waste heat from businesses and homes into the system will also play an important role  the task of policymakers and businesses is to align the changes that will result from the transition to climate neutrality with the economic and social trends as effectively as possible and to leverage the resulting synergies  this especially pertains to businesses and the workforce to

sees substantial hurdles and uncertainties with these technological solutions in terms of domestic storage capacity and ensuring permanent and safe storage  it must be noted here that secured storage capacity that is generally suitable for co is very limited in austria  the current potential domestic 2storage capacity is estimated at between 400 and 510 million tonnes of coor up to 26  in this context enabling grid operators to build and operate electrolysis systems should be considered if these contribute to maintaining a reliable high-capacity grid  in 2017 about 85 of the newly installed electric generation capacity used renewable technologies and a good third of the electric demand was covered by renewable sources  valentin and 13 crude oil and product storage facilities with a capacity of over 1000 m each  natural gas storage facilities with a total capacity of 8  the use of geothermal energy can be a valuable expansion of the austrian energy mix because it is not only co neutral but also has a base load capacity  a gas storage capacity of around 2 0 billion nm3 with a corresponding withdrawal capacity is required to ensure security of supply with natural gas  based on this and considering the objective of reducing gas consumption by a least 40 by 2050 a hydrogen storage capacity of around 3 5 billion nm3 with corresponding withdrawal capacity should be available by 2050 3 current situation in austria the geological structures that are currently used in austria are hydrocarbon reservoirs which have a substantially higher storage capacity than deep saline aquifers  flourishing international trade will ensure the supply of hydrogen as a fuel for austrian industry beyond the national production capacity by 2050 which will require energy partnerships with other neighbouring economic areas  the fundamental objective is to shift to clean climate-friendly modes of transport improve capacity utilisation in freight and passenger traffic and avoid traffic  city centres are to be strengthened local supply as well as the connection to public transport shall be ensured  87 however it will not be possible to maintain this high forest sink capacity over the long

be re-naturalised / unsealed existing sealed surfaces should be removed and the areas planted with greenery wherever possible  married couple in the city two adults live in a central district of a provincial capital both are employees  expanding storage capacities can also contribute to supplying end users with more regionally generated energy  the creation of short-term markets should increase liquidity and make it easier for operators of volatile renewable generation capacities to market their electric under fair conditions and open up new business opportunities  off-grid systems with small storage units and grids with large storage capacities will provide for robust and efficient energy and storage infrastructure for the optimal use of renewable energy sources in a functioning

and use of energy especially relating to the generation of electric from renewable sources and the storage of this electric a change in the modal split in terms of passenger and freight traffic towards environmentally friendly transport modes and vehicles that lead to a substantial reduction in the annual distance travelled by car the heavy promotion of the thermal and energy refurbishment of buildings a switch to sustainable energy sources and technologies in the industry sector which must be available in the necessary quantities production grids storage and long-lasting products designed to implement the circular economy combined with increased energy and resource efficiency steel production will shift from the traditional blast furnace process to electric- and hydrogen-based

and natural gas does not include electric and district heating produced with fossil fuels the share of coal in the final energy use of manufacturing is low at 5  spatial planning zoning and development planning have had the effect that sealing of areas has been reduced and the demand for heat condensed waste heat potentials can be used very effectively and a large share of heating and cooling in buildings can be effected with grid-bound energy sources such as district and local heating and renewable gas  district heating plays a central role in urban areas with high heat absorption densities combined with close proximities to capable suppliers of waste heat  2 20 part of this is simply the result of the shifting of emissions to emissions trading by switching energy sources to district heating and electric  according to the climate and energy strategy mission2030 around half of the roughly 700000 oil heating systems currently in use are to be replaced with innovative renewable energy systems or efficient district heating by 2030  the existing heating systems powered by liquid fossil fuels will be successively replaced with systems powered by renewable energy sources or climate-friendly district heating starting in 2025  the addition of new connections for space and water heating is still possible in exceptions if justified by the unavailability of district heating  in areas that are or will be equipped with heating/cooling energy grids such as district heating the heating consumer density should be increased through spatial

starting with a clarification of the supervision roles and responsibilities of the national government local governments private and public parties and citizens  to an important extent the contents of the climate plan are based on the climate agreement which was concluded between more than 100 civil society parties both public and private  it will also involve a search for new methods of cooperation both between the various levels of government and between the government and civil society parties  civil society parties could play a key role in making international production chains more sustainable and more climate-friendly provided they are facilitated in fulfilling that role  a gradual transition will contribute to cost-efficiency offer the dutch business sector a competitive edge in the longer term and give every dutch citizen an opportunity to do his or her bit  this will have immediate consequences for the physical environment as currently experienced by citizens and business owners  as all parties citizens and businesses alike will be affected by the transition differently climate policy must also deal with challenges regarding burden-sharing and feelings of

governments private and public parties and citizens  the transition could be facilitated by instruments of a stimulatory nature that reward citizens and business that have the opportunity and the will to take steps now  from the perspective of citizens it is easy to achieve climate benefits by adopting changes to production processes and products that require little behavioural change such as energy-saving appliances or applications like smart meters  in addition the climate footprint of citizens will also change autonomously as a result of the increasing availability of climate-friendly products and solutions that they find appealing  in other cases citizens will be asked to play a more active role and show greater commitment such as in terms of changing the way they heat their homes  when the above conditions for the participation of citizens are met there will be greater scope for more compulsive instruments such as normative measures  to a certain extent what goes for citizens

" this means that tax revenues will be lower and companies cannot expect as high a return on their capital as in the petroleum sector  changing economic conditions including the development of new technology and alterations in demand and competitive conditions mean that some companies and industries will grow while others become less important  companies that are able to produce goods or services with low or zero emissions of greenhouse gases will be the winners in this situation  reporting on climate risk can raise companies awareness of the types of climate-related risks and opportunities they may face  there are many similarities between companies that are succeeding in 2050 and those that were successful before the low-emission transition  both current and anticipated prices of emissions will influence how individuals and companies adapt and the decisions they make  this means that the contribution made by norwegian companies to emission reductions in europe through their participation in the eu ets will be included in assessments of progress towards the target  companies therefore need considerable willingness to invest and take risks  it focuses mainly on companies in early phases of development but can also make follow-up investments in later phases  nysnø invests in companies that are not listed on the stock market and/or funds that target such companies and that operate in or from norway  it also recommends intensifying work on active ownership both individually and collectively for example through dialogue with companies boards and management voting at general meetings and cooperating with asset managers  one important recommendation by the commission is that norwegian companies should use the tcfd framework for climate-related financial disclosures  large norwegian companies should report in line with the tcfd framework  the public sector individual people and companies are all consumers and can play a part in the shift to a low-emission development pathway by demanding goods and services that result in low emissions both in the production phase and during use  in 2019 the norwegian environment agency began to publish detailed information on biofuel sales by different companies and the agency for public management and egovernment has published guidance on purchasing biofuels that are associated with a low risk of deforestation  cooperating with the eu on climate policy can help to ensure a cost-effective transformation process and equal conditions of competition for businesses in norway and the eu  the businesses and industries will play an important part in developing and deploying low-emission technologies and solutions  businesses included in the eu ets will like businesses in the eu have to change within a system where very few emission allowances will be issued by 2050 and new allowances will cease to be issued soon after 2050 assuming that the eu continues to maintain the rules for linear reduction of the emission cap  in its 2018 report the climate risk commission pointed out that it is important for businesses to improve their understanding of climate risk so that they have a stronger basis for decision making and can ensure that investment decisions are more robust in the face of greater uncertainty  it runs various programmes that provide investment support and risk reduction for businesses that are developing and testing new solutions or that wish to make use of new technology  funding from enova reduces the risk for businesses and makes it more likely that new solutions will be developed and deployed  39 the research council also administers the skattefunn tax incentive scheme a rights-based scheme that provides tax deductions for all businesses engaged in r&d  the governments efforts are intended to facilitate a shift to a more sustainble pathway by consumers businesses and others  a number of businesses are already conscious of their role here and are involved in efforts to develop a more sustainable society 5 principles of green competitiveness the government set out certain principles of green competitiveness in its strategy the authorities must provide a predictable framework and act as a driving force in norways transition to a low-emission society the polluter must pay as part of an integrated policy to promote green competitiveness norways target of being a low-emission society by 2050 must be taken into account in planning and investment processes there must be targeted initiatives for and a special focus on climate and environment in publicly-funded research innovation and technology development wherever relevant the public sector as a customer must support the adoption and development of new environmentally friendly technologies products and solutions the necessary information must be available to enable consumers the business sector and investors to choose green solutions and products green competitiveness must be based on well-functioning markets  finance norway points out that as a lender insurer and investor the financial 40 sector can be a good partner and driver of change in other industries through both pricing and cooperation  norway has also endorsed the guidelines for a just transition adopted by the international labour organization ilo  19international labour organization 2015 guidelines for a just transition towards environmentally sustainable economies and societies for all 30 knowledge is the key to continuing the development of new green competitive jobs and a better more effective public sector  global growth must be kept within safe ecological limits in order to maintain the capacity of natural systems to provide the ecosystem services on which we all depend  together with growing pressure on natural resources and land accompanied by the loss of species and 3 ecosystems and litter and other pollution climate change is a serious threat to the worlds capacity to provide fundamental services such as clean water sufficient food and safe homes  this high level of consumption will result in resource scarcity in many important sectors and areas by 2050  establishing a circular economy in which resources are not wasted and the value of products and materials is maintained for as long as possible is a way of counteracting resource scarcity  both resource scarcity and climate change impacts will alter conditions for urban development up to 2050 in many parts of the world  for example the nordic and european power markets are becoming more and more closely integrated both in regulatory terms through the eea agreement and physically as new interconnectors are built to increase transmission capacity between countries  however the commission concluded that norway is less vulnerable to climate change than most other countries and one of the countries with greatest adaptive capacity  higher income levels and flexible labour markets also give greater capacity to absorb the costs of a transition to a low-emission society  land-use management by the municipalities influences the capacity of land to absorb and store carbon  for example since 2017 the city of oslo has required its own construction sites to be fossil-free and is now testing whether it can also require them to be emission-free  enovas goals are to promote 38 reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that will contribute towards norways emission reduction commitment for 2030 greater innovation in energy and climate technology that is adapted to the transition to a low-emission society improved security of supply through flexible and efficient use of energy and peak load capacity  norways plan is to develop a co storage site 2with considerably more capacity than is needed for the norwegian full-scale project  in developing countries where the authorities capacity is limited it is important to take a coordinated approach to development goals and work towards several goals at the same time  norway will therefore intensify its efforts to build up knowledge and capacity that will make it possible to coordinate work on climate change and air pollution  many of the worlds largest cities are low lying and at risk from sea level rise and will be affected by changing rainfall patterns and heatwaves 5 c will have positive effects on progress towards other sdgs especially those on good health clean energy for all sustainable cities and communities responsible consumption and production and life below water  cities and communities are designed to minimise greenhouse gas emissions and provide good living conditions for their inhabitants  transport needs have been reduced by developing more compact cities and communities and new digital communication solutions  22 climate-smart cities and communities and a high quality of life cities and communities are attractive and climate-friendly provide good safe living conditions and workplaces and encourage an active healthy lifestyle  norways cities and communities have been made more attractive by upgrading meeting places and public spaces  this is being done in a way that takes into account the need for green spaces promotes peoples well-being and results in dynamic cities and communities  new technologies and climate-smart solutions are an integral part of everyones lives whether they live in the cities or in rural areas  a few municipalities including hamar and the cities of bergen and oslo have in addition established local carbon budgets and municipal bodies report on progress towards targets 5 principles of green competitiveness the government set out certain principles of green competitiveness in its strategy the authorities must provide a predictable framework and act as a driving force in norways transition to a low-emission society the polluter must pay as part of an integrated policy to promote green competitiveness norways target of being a

research innovation and technology development wherever relevant the public sector as a customer must support the adoption and development of new environmentally friendly technologies products and solutions the necessary information must be available to enable consumers the business sector and investors to choose green solutions and products green competitiveness must be based on well-functioning markets  in addition countries like norway generally have better-functioning institutions a higher level of education and a more diversified business sector  in a survey of norways major financial institutions the norwegian climate foundation found that climate risk is on the agenda of the management and board of most institutions and that most of them are taking steps to build up their employees expertise in this field  source stortingsmelding 25 20182019 framtidas forbrukar grøn smart og digital the government will focus on increasing knowledge about sustainable consumption through information and teaching in schools and other educational institutions  these institutions are important arenas for raising awareness about ethical issues and environmental and resource problems and for raising the level of knowledge about consumption and sustainability norways long-term low-emission strategy for 2050 an innovative society with attractive towns and communities note the strategy was adopted in norway by the norwegian parliament in october 2019  the benefits of a low-emission future will also include towns that are pleasant to live and work in with cleaner air and less congestion and crowding  decisions made today will determine what energy and transport systems towns and buildings forests and countryside are like in 2050  this would be the equivalent of building a new town of 1  they described a low-emission society in 2050 as emission-free safe and resilient with innovative local communities and towns  there 19 is infrastructure for cycling walking and public transport both in and outside towns  the air is cleaner and more public transport is available both within and outside towns  outside the larger towns communities have dynamic centres with a good balance between residential areas commercial activities and workplaces 3 climate-smart towns and communities and spatial management in line with a low-emission development

particularly important for sustainable land use and climate-smart towns and communities central government planning guidelines for coordinated housing land-use and transport planning which highlight the importance of coordinating development 33 patterns and transport systems  they encourage the development of compact towns and urban areas and steps to promote green forms of transport  they also include guidance for finding a balance between different interests when designing towns and urban communities  municipal and county authorities are responsible for spatial planning to provide areas that are attractive both to live in and for business development  34 integrated urban land-use and transport agreements involving central government county and municipal bodies are being negotiated for norways largest urban areas 2 the klimasats grant scheme the klimasats grant scheme was established in 2016 and provides support for municipal and county projects  42 national county and municipal

where relevant  but choices made by the norwegian government the storting norwegian parliament and by municipalities and counties the business sector and individuals in norway on resource use spatial management and how and where to build and travel will have major impacts on the situation in norway in 2050  central government counties and municipalities the business sector research institutes voluntary organisations and individuals all have important roles to play in developing a low-emission society  source federation of norwegian industries 2016 the norwegian process industries roadmap combining growth and zero emissions by 2050 summary in english the municipalities and counties have wide responsibilities they provide services exercise authority and purchase large quantities of goods and services  this means that the municipalities and counties are at the heart of the low-emission transformation process  the municipalities and counties are major purchasers of goods and services  the counties are partly responsible for public transport services and have been using requirements in procurement processes to promote the development and use of zero-emission solutions in this field  these include central government counties and municipalities the business sector including the financial industry and civil 20 nou 2018 17 summary climate risk and the norwegian economy 32 society  the government has therefore adopted central government planning guidelines for municipalities and counties  central government planning guidelines on climate and energy planning and climchangeadapt which are intended to facilitate action by municipalities counties and central government agencies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote a green energy transition through planning processes and otherwise when exercising authority  the norwegian environment agency provides guidance draws up greenhouse gas emission statistics for municipalities and counties and has developed a tool for calculating the effects of different mitigation measures on emissions  the counties and municipalities must use them as a basis for work on regional and municipal planning strategies and plans and they also apply to central government participation in these planning processes  this applies to all counties and municipalities regardless of their size and expertise  it will use a variety of tools including monitoring progress towards targets and pricing emissions to promote a low-emission development pathway for business and industry local government and individuals  the national programme for supplier development is a driver of innovative procurement by contracting authorities at central and local government level  everyone must be included from individuals to civil society organisations  one of norways overall political goals is to increase participation in civil society organisations and voluntary work  norways consumer policy together with its climate and environmental policy is intended to drive the development of new sustainable solutions by facilitating cooperation between the business sector authorities and civil society  the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc and the intergovernmental science-policy platform on biodiversity and ecosystem services ipbes have concluded that challenges in both these areas must be resolved to promote welfare improvements and social development for the world population  in order to achieve this long-term temperature target countries agreed that they would aim to reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible and to undertake rapid reductions after this in accordance with best available science so as to achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century  these will be based on the best available science and as far as possible will be quantitative and measurable 3

" 13 - inclusion of the sustainability aspect into the framework of company management and reporting to the investors about the attainment of all three aspects of sustainability  it will also accelerate investment in promising but not yet economically feasible projects involving res in companies promote necessary research innovation and pilot projects and raise awareness of the public about the importance of the transition to res  in comparison to the eu the slovenian business sector has a large proportion of energy-intensive value-added activities and a relatively low number of companies accounting for the majority of energy consumed and emissions generated in manufacturing  the establishment of suitable incentives or economic signals is crucial for network integration of res local adaptation of generation and demand and the cooperation of industrial companies in system services  energy costs are high for companies and imported fuels have a large share in the eu balance of trade and directly impact the economic performance of nation states  energy efficiency and other measures for reducing energy use are thus measures which will be very important for slovenian companies and the state as they will result in direct economic benefits by means of energy cost management and contribute to the economic performance  for the most part the transition may take place within the existing companies with a gradual transition to energy or emission-less intensive products and the establishment of circular economy principles but there are also other options  slovenia will also support the integration of industrial companies with district heating systems which could utilise excess heat from industry for the heating of other consumers households service and agricultural sectors  due to the complexity of the transition to climate neutrality the management of development activities of research organisations and industrial companies will present a great challenge so slovenia will provide appropriate guidance for development incentives with the objective of ensuring research and infrastructural support for the transition  the technologies proposed will serve as the basis for enhancing the competencies of industrial companies in the field of competitiveness and technological development  slovenia will promote the necessary connectivity of industrial companies with district heating systems which will be addressed in further detail in the district heating strategy which is being drafted 6 key factors for attaining target emissions by 2050 to decarbonise the industry sector and support climate neutrality the following factors will be crucial - enhancement of the transition to a low-carbon circular economy which according to the assessments of the international resource panel is supposed to contribute at least 60 per cent to the reduction of ghg emissions in the global economy or to decarbonisation - establishment of incentives which will help companies to update production processes - establishment of an efficient support environment for pilot project implementation targeted incentives for small and medium-sized enterprises relating to the transition to a low-carbon and digitalised economy by eliminating administrative barriers improvement of access to various financial sources - development production and introduction of new sustainable products and services and business models energy and material efficient technological solutions establishment of a support environment for the development of an offer of comprehensive services for energy management - support for the development of a market for technologies with low emissions with the introduction of various mechanisms e  a products lower carbon footprint as a criterion in the public procurement procedure - harmonisation between the implementation of a low-carbon transition in energy and industry particularly from the aspect of ensuring a sufficient proportion of fuels from renewable sources for industry use such as synthetic gas and hydrogen - increase in efficiency of energy use use of effective technologies with maximum efficiency best available technologies bat increase in the exploitation of res and excess heat and integration with dh systems - competitiveness of low-carbon energy products - establishment of infrastructure and suitable legislative framework for the use of synthetic gas and hydrogen - promotion of digitalisation in companies and the introduction of industry 4  there are numerous companies and individuals who have actively contributed to the development of national and international mobility in the past and present which is why slovenia will further invest in research and development  the foregoing combined with import dependency on natural resources and low reuse of waste material in the long term denote a relatively great pressure on the competitiveness of slovenian companies  2in september 2015 the government of the republic of slovenia adopted the slovenian smart specialisation strategy s4 which is the implementation plan for the transition to a high-productivity economy by enhancing innovation capacities promoting transformation and diversification of industries into new activities and the growth of new and fast-growing companies  in the necp a circular economy is incorporated in the scope of reducing emissions with the key commitment to support companies for an efficient and competitive transition to a climate-neutral and circular economy by improving energy and material efficiency in all sectors and thus reduce the use of energy and other natural resources as the first and key measure for the transition to a circular low-carbon economy and climate-neutral society with measures and policies in the economy including non-reimbursable financial incentives for measures of reducing process emissions in industry and non-reimbursable financial incentives for measures of reducing ghg emissions in industry with the measures of a circular economy  industry or economic policies promotion of companies and particularly small and medium-sized enterprises and green public procurement  the measures will focus on sustainable consumption and production research and innovation support and will provide new opportunities for eco-innovative companies  - competitiveness innovation economy privatesect investment jobs added value start-up companies patents and innovations etc  it will give priority to promoting the integration of climate risks in the management of financial companies  at least 3 per cent of gdp by 2030 of which at least 1 per cent of gdp will be derived from public resources more investments in the development of human resources and new knowledge for the transition to a climate-neutral society support to companies for a competitive and efficient transition promotion of targeted research projects and multidisciplinary development and research programmes and demonstration projects the climate objectives must also be observed by the research and innovation strategy of slovenia riss steering of companies towards financing and participation in development and research projects with an active tax policy promotion of new and enhancement of the already existing development and research programmes compliant with the necp objectives  the positive effects of additional measures are also reflected in increased savings by companies and households with a simultaneous reduction in the current budget deficit of the state

which will be mutually connected and will enhance and upgrade one another - awareness and competence for the transition to a circular society - drafting of education programmes of knowledge centres and development programmes and the promotion of elements of the circular economy and society in communities at national regional and local levels with a special emphasis on the transformation of consumer patterns - direct promotion of the circular economic development in all economic branches with a special focus on energy-intensive processes and circularity intensive support for small and medium-sized enterprises and the preparation of bases for the development of new entrepreneurial ideas and public-private partnership - formation of policies and organisation of the circular low-carbon society with a preparation of legislative and incentive mechanisms which will directly steer circularly oriented purchasing processes and simultaneously address the functioning of public structures private investors and research and academic institutions - formation of new business models and promotion of market development by introducing sustainable business models to expand the offer of services related to the offer of products and thus enhance the added value and competitiveness in these activities  13 - inclusion of the sustainability aspect into the framework of company management and reporting to the investors about the attainment of all three aspects of sustainability  in compliance with the egd slovenia will strengthen the integration of the sustainability aspect into the corporate governance framework and report to its investors on the achievement of all three sustainability aspects  in particular the investors face the following obstacles high initial investment costs and the ability to finance and manage risks related to the transition to lcs  it will also be very important that simultaneously with the tightening of its climate policy the 39 eu also enforces the carbon border adjustment mechanism for specific economic sectors which will be efficient and compliant with the rules of the world trade organization as anticipated in the egd for countries with less strict objectives  in the field of civil aviation slovenia cooperates in the formation and implementation of the resolution of the international civil aviation organization icao on the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation corsia  for efficient and qualitative siting in space human resources capacity will be ensured and mechanisms for resolving disagreements between spatial developers and holders of projects or plans will be established in addition to other measures 3 objective by 2050 from the strategic framework for climchangeadapt the objective in the field of climchangeadapt is to reduce slovenias exposure sensitivity and vulnerability to climate change impact and increase the climate resilience and adaptive capacity of society  an accelerated development of an electric distribution network is anticipated with the objective of increasing the capacity resilience to disturbances and flexibility to support electrification especially in transport and to increase a dispersed electric generation from res by 2030  this will improve the integration of spatial and transport planning legal arrangements of comprehensive planning reduce the suburbanisation trend improve the management of daily migrations in broader urban areas and other functionally linked areas enhance the compactness of towns enhance the renovation and reactivation of poorly utilised or degraded areas in rural settlements for activities enabling an increase in local employment and a reduction in daily migrations to towns and accordingly arrange micromobility hubs on city arterial roads and along motorways - actively promote the construction of an infrastructure for walking and cycling for daily users including suitable infrastructure for charging stations and promotion of the use of electric bicycles - change the excise duty policy and adjust the toll policy in accordance with the guidelines of the eu legislation - ensure suitable support environment for a comprehensive electrification of the port of koper - provide suitable support environment for the use of alternative fuels such as electric liquefied and compressed natural gas which will be gradually replaced by synthetic gas syngas hydrogen h and liquefied petroleum gas lpg which is of transitory nature 2and biofuels and - simplify administrative procedures in transport electrification  a modern railway network will be established which will enable regulated frequent and fast rail transport between city centres  access to restricted city centres will be limited to the most sustainable forms of transport  for efficient and qualitative siting in space human resources capacity will be ensured and mechanisms for resolving disagreements between spatial developers and holders of projects or plans will be established  railway hubs will be modernised and high-capacity and regional lines will be constructed in accordance with slovenias needs  key measures in rail transport include - upgrade of railway corridors main lines for increasing capacity and attaining the ten-t standards - upgrade of regional railway lines for shortening travel times and increasing the attraction of rail passenger transport electrification and double-track lines in accordance with need - construction of a railway infrastructure to remove freight transit transport from city centres and urban settlements due to noise social and economic reasons spatial aspects etc  road capacity intended for road transport will be expanded only when it is not possible to ensure a suitable level of public mobility or supply to the economy in another way existing road infrastructure rail transport public passenger transport etc  slovenia will promote management methods and good practices which accelerate the production of food fodder fibres and wood biomass in accordance with the carrying capacity of forest sites or agricultural land ensure food safety and enhance the stability of forest agricultural and other ecosystems  not all member states regions and cities start the transition from the same point or have the same capacity to respond 7 efficiency of resource usage governance and management slovenia will concentrate knowledge and human resources capacity for the efficient management of public resources to promote the transition to a low-carbon circular economy and adaptation to climate change  among other measures the strategy proposes an increase in the proportion of protected areas on land and at sea binding objectives for restoration of damaged ecosystems and rivers improvement of the conservation status of protected habitats species and pollinators on agricultural land pollution reduction greening of cities promotion of organic farming and other nature-friendly agricultural practices and the improvement of the condition of european forests  the guidelines emphasise that the natura 2000 areas play a crucial role as natural carbon storage sites provision of natural capacities for storing carbon a user of carbon dioxide increasing the capture of carbon dioxide in natural ecosystems a risk reducer regarding the effect of extreme events

planned within the expenditure programme of the climate change fund 20202023 in cooperation with the ministry of the environment and spatial planning and all key public institutions in the field of education the national education institute of the republic of slovenia the institute of the republic of slovenia for vocational education and training the slovenian institute for adult education the centre for school and outdoor education and the national school of leadership in education  despite the institutional division of treatment and responsibilities cultural and natural heritage are inseparable and should be understood as such and addressed within climate change measures  the system will be based on a harmonised utilisation of non-refundable and refundable public funds and financing sources provided by financial institutions and funds  in this field it is possible to attract investment capital from the funds and other dedicated financing resources of international financial institutions but the activation of private financing resources is of key importance  for efficient implementation the competencies and tasks of the institutions will be defined in more detail and will be enhanced if necessary e  many measures will be implemented by the municipalities themselves or in cooperation with the institutions at the state level e 6 consumption patterns slovenia will define responsible institutions for promoting changes in consumption patterns  at present the incentives are dispersed in more than four institutions  due to its small size slovenia cannot carry out all the necessary innovations and research on its own and will thus strive for the active participation of slovenian development and research institutions and the business sector in international research and projects and will simultaneously attempt to stop the brain or knowledge drain abroad  these will use human resources and knowledge of the already existing institutions e in accordance with regulation eu no 525/2013 slovenia is obliged to establish a system for reporting measures orientations and projections which includes institutional legislative and procedural arrangements  this will improve the integration of spatial and transport planning legal arrangements of comprehensive planning reduce the suburbanisation trend improve the management of daily migrations in broader urban areas and other functionally linked areas enhance the compactness of towns enhance the renovation and reactivation of poorly utilised or degraded areas in rural settlements for activities enabling an increase in local employment and a reduction in daily migrations to towns and accordingly arrange micromobility hubs on city arterial roads and along motorways - actively promote the construction of an infrastructure for walking and cycling for daily users including suitable infrastructure for charging stations and promotion of the use of electric bicycles - change the excise duty policy and adjust the toll policy in accordance with the guidelines of the eu legislation - ensure suitable support environment for a comprehensive electrification of the port of koper - provide suitable support environment for the use of alternative fuels such as electric liquefied and compressed natural gas which will be gradually replaced by synthetic gas syngas hydrogen h and liquefied petroleum gas lpg which is of transitory nature 2and biofuels and - simplify administrative procedures in transport electrification  within the scope of reducing mobility demand slovenia will improve the local attractiveness of cities and towns by providing basic e  the future of efficient passenger transport requires the decisive modernisation of public passenger transport especially rail transport which has potential in the surrounding area of large towns e  parking areas outside the park and ride system will be gradually reduced particularly in town centres  planning and construction of large parking areas will be limited in town centres e  in addition to public passenger transport cycling and walking will be at the forefront in towns and cities  slovenia will ensure a suitable infrastructure for active sustainable mobility in towns and in the countryside  safe direct and comfortable cycling paths will be arranged in towns between towns and between towns and rural areas  in towns where district systems are present the necp prioritises centralised systems  - participate in the formation and adoption of binding legislative requirements about sustainable products in the eu - enhance the role of consumers and observe the circular economy in public procurement - focus on the sectors that use the most resources and in which circulation potential is great - limit the generation of waste and allow its transformation into high-quality secondary resources - integrate the efforts for circular operations and integration of people regions and towns - participate in global efforts in the field of the circular economy  fewer meetings in person in town centres which will reduce transport or mobility needs  sustainable construction in towns and communities in connection with the promotion of entrepreneurship and the circular economy bim energy renovation of buildings energy self-sufficiency of towns and communities digitalisation of public lighting with smart light management and light allocation and sustainable materials construction of new and expansion of the already existing district heating and cooling networks which primarily rely on res  financial incentives and regulations were crucial among the current measures which include the support scheme promoting electric generation from res the act governing the conditions of a concession for harnessing the energy potential of the lower sava river investment incentives for measures of the use of res as a source of heat in households and heat production in district heating systems using res regulations governing efficient use of energy in buildings pures and a mandatory minimum share of the use of res cogeneration and excess heat or their combinations in district heating systems  the key measures defined in the necp for promoting res are financial supports investment supports for households and district heating systems and the support scheme promoting decentralised electric generation from res  electric and gas networks district heating systems and others  the exploitation of res in district heating and cooling systems will be promoted as a priority in order to attain synergies between climate policy and air protection policy 5 key factors for attaining the objectives in 2050 - increase in electric generation from res - increase in heat and cold supply from res in buildings and industry - large proportion of heat and cold supply from res in district heating and/or cooling systems - increase in the proportion of res in transport 24 - breakthrough technologies and systems to support res energy storage system integration system flexibility increase of network capacities for distribution and electric transmission etc  successful development of district heating and cooling systems is planned including a one-per cent annual increase in the share of res and excess heat and cold in district heating and cooling systems and a continuation of existing instruments for measure promotion  part of the solution is also the cogeneration of heat and electric by means of carbon-neutral resources in district heating systems and active consumers which was already taken into account in the analysed scenarios  short-term and seasonal storage will be attained with solutions within the electric system on the consumer side by integrating electric systems with district heating systems and gas network and the enhancement of international connections and the introduction of digitalisation  district heating and cooling systems already have a lesser share in ghg emissions when supplying electric but to further reduce ghg emissions in the future they will primarily be based on the exploitation of excess heat and renewable and other climate-neutral energy sources e  the share of res in district heating and cooling systems hereinafter dhc will increase intensively in addition to wood biomass especially through the installation of larger shallow geothermal heat pumps also see chapter 4  although the amount of heat from district heating systems will be reduced slovenia will double the share of buildings using district heating and cooling systems by 2050  resilience to climate change will be the primary consideration when planning district heating and cooling systems reduced need for heating increased need for cooling 6 key factors for attaining target emissions by 2050 to decarbonise the sector and support decarbonisation in other sectors the following factors will be crucial - higher energy efficiency of all systems - gradual phasing out of coal and other fossil fuels - significant increase in electric generation from low-carbon energy sources - significant increase in electric generation from carbon-neutral gaseous fuels - establishment of a supply system with alternative fuels to allow the phasing out of fossil fuels in freight transport - decarbonisation and expansion of district heating systems - development of systems especially networks towards greater flexibility and integration of systems or sectors - construction of systems for storage of electric and other energies - new technologies 8 proposed progress monitoring indicators - ghg emissions in the energy supply sector - res shares in gross final energy consumption electric energy in transport and energy for heating and cooling - shares of carbon-neutral sources in the supply of liquid fuels gaseous fuels and in electric generation - specific emissions per unit of generated electric in the supply of liquid fuels and gaseous fuels - share of buildings being heated from district heating systems - share of res and excess heat in district heating and cooling systems - average specific emissions per unit of generated district heating in all systems in slovenia  an increased use of biomass in collective and industrial heating devices is also anticipated as is integration with district heating  slovenia will also support the integration of industrial companies with district heating systems which could utilise excess heat from industry for the heating of other consumers households service and agricultural sectors  slovenia will promote the necessary connectivity of industrial companies with district heating systems which will be addressed in further detail in the district heating strategy which is being drafted 1 guidelines and measures to be adopted by 2030 the necp plans a higher rate of energy renovation greater emphasis on res technologies for heating and hot watersupply higher number of connections to district heating systems and considerable growth of their number in areas where this is economically justified  in towns where district systems are present the necp prioritises centralised systems  fossil fuel technologies will be replaced by technologies using res or combined heat and power stations and connections to district heating systems  the use of fossil fuels will decrease significantly in buildings and district systems will be utilised to the maximum as they enable greater flexibility and connectivity with other sectors e  sustainable construction in towns and communities in connection with the promotion of entrepreneurship and the circular economy bim energy renovation of buildings energy self-sufficiency of towns and communities digitalisation of public lighting with smart light management and light allocation and sustainable materials construction of new and expansion of the already existing district heating and cooling networks which primarily rely on res

entire scope of investments  the earmarked funds collected represent about one sixth of the funds that will be needed in the future to carry out the anticipated scope of investments necessary for a successful transition to a climate-neutral society by 2050 - private financial funds will be engaged to a greater extent five sixths to carry out the transition to a climate-neutral society by 2050 privatesect investment opportunities 81 vary - the funding gap will be covered through the prioritised application of the eu funds available and financing through financial instruments which rely on eu sources 4 providing green financing of investments and other measures to meet these ambitions the majority of investments in public and privatesects which will be implemented until 2050 will have to be steered  the necp also promotes the application of digitalisation in climate measures and an enhancement of cybersecurity in all strategic systems research and development activities between the public and privatesects and the establishment of competitive conditions for innovative research work in public undertakings  it highlights that an approach at the level of the whole of society international national regional and local levels public and privatesects and civil society is needed to efficiently deal with the consequences of climate change and a just and inclusive transition to

it highlights that an approach at the level of the whole of society international national regional and local levels public and privatesects and civil society is needed to efficiently deal with the consequences of climate change and a just and inclusive transition to a climate-neutral society  in particular slovenia advocates the importance of including the civil society and young people in the formation of climate policies and discussions at the international level  the latest findings of 9 the intergovernmental science-policy platform on biodiversity and ecosystem services ipbes i  environmental studies of natural sciences engineering social sciences and humanities are also important as interdisciplinarity will be promoted  slovenia will acknowledge this and it will enhance and promote climate content in education programmes of natural technical social sciences and humanities studies  knowledge from natural sciences social sciences and humanities must be observed for a comprehensive balanced and sustainable heritage conservation and management  a multidisciplinary approach is a challenge condition and necessity when designing heritage and climate sciences  a lack of social science analyses and research is noted in slovenia regarding the transition to climate neutrality without such knowledge a challenging social transition is not possible  in cooperation with the ministry responsible for the environment and climate change the ministry responsible for research will prepare an analysis of required social science research in the shortest time possible or until the update of the necp and determine priority fields or topics  within the climate action summit convened by the un secretary-general in september 2019 the republic of slovenia joined the youth

joined the declaration on children youth and climate action by means of which countries strive for inclusive and children-friendly climate policies and ensure the participation of young people in decision-making processes relating to climate change at national and global levels  the costs and benefits of the transition will be distributed in a fair way due to the most vulnerable groups of citizens being enabled to implement mitigation and adaptation measures  adaptation measures will be cost-efficient and the most vulnerable groups of citizens will also be able to access them  the growing external costs incurred by slovenia and its citizens due to transport also require action outside the framework of the fight against climate change  furthermore slovenia will actively raise its citizens awareness that their everyday decisions affect significantly the scope of transport and thus the environment e 1 awareness-raising and information dissemination the 2019 public opinion survey eurobarometer revealed that citizens of the european union believe that climate change should be the main priority of the european parliament  some 76 per cent of citizens understand climate change as a severe problem  the principles of climate justice will be observed accordingly the costs and benefits of the transition will be distributed fairly and the most vulnerable groups of citizens will be enabled to implement measures to mitigate and adapt to climate changes  slovenia will ensure that the most vulnerable groups of the population are able to carry out measures for the transition to lcs and in particular that the measures do not worsen the financial situation of citizens in the first and second income quintile groups  furthermore it was estimated that the welfare of citizens of the first and second quintile groups worsens in the scenarios of the transition to a low-carbon society  as a result measures for these groups of citizens will be enhanced in addition to other measures of general social policy see chapter 11 incentives for the energy renovation of buildings and other measures of efficient energy use will be reinforced to encourage investment for the most vulnerable groups of citizens  the ec proposal anticipates a just and inclusive transition to carbon neutrality and puts the health and wellbeing of citizens first  it will increase its ambition relating to wind power exploitation and develop programmes for incorporating local communities in this development  measures to enhance human resources at the local level and in their support institutions and to integrate local communities at all levels of preparation and implementation of projects will be implemented  slovenia will provide support and knowledge to local communities for the preparation or implementation of adaptation measures  national transport systems and infrastructure will be adjusted to support new services of sustainable mobility by means of which it will be possible to reduce congestion and pollution especially in the areas of cities and local communities  guidelines for its management set challenges and recommend measures which should be observed by governments local communities civil society the business sector and experts  when managing the state and local communities the progress criteria will in addition to the 80 currently established economic criteria also include the assessment of social and environmental wellbeing and risks which will be exceptionally important for climate change management  following the adoption of this strategy the ministry responsible for the environment will produce a brief handbook for local communities which will include main orientations and 90 fields of action for municipalities on the basis of which they will be able to prepare local strategies and plans  it is necessary to define the method of cooperation between national banks when drafting instruments at the national level and the

associated with climate change acquire special relevance in the urban environment  adaptation to climate change a certain number of impacts derived from climate change for example the heat island effect amplifies the effects of high temperatures the high degree of waterproofing of the soil constitutes a factor of vulnerability to torrential rain having less capacity for water infiltration in the soil  as an example the city of bilbao the level of flooding in a period of 50 years ci would exceed 3 85 m in 2010 to 4 m in 2040  critical infrastructures with the greatest potential

generation fixed the effect of hydraulicity the 35 2 above the european average shows the evolution of the weight of renewable energies in the generation of electrical energy in spain with respect to the european average  this high capacity to integrate electric production from renewable sources together with the recent but every time higher participation of electrical renewables in the adjustment markets of the electrical system the lower installation costs of these technologies show the excellent starting point of spain to continue notably increasing said participation and thus taking important steps towards the full decarbonization of the same in 2050  the increase in interconnection capacity will increase security of supply at a particularly critical moment due to the greater penetration of non-regulated renewable energies and intermittent nature  the interconnections will also make it possible to reduce discharges once the renewable production capacity exceeds the demand improving the profitability of these energies and facilitating their greater implementation 5 electrical energy exchange capacities41 fuente entso-e - tyndp 2018 regional insight report north-south interconnections west although there is a european objective of reaching a minimum capacity of 10 of interconnection between the members of the eu for the year 2020 15 in 2030 spain is still very far from those figures  40 in 2017 a group of experts iteg proposed to replace the criterion of 15 interconnection capacity over installed power by a new methodology based on 3 criteria market price difference 30 of peak demand and interconnection capacity 30 of peak generation  expected evolution for storage currently in spain there are 3 installed 3 gw of pure pumping and 2 adjustable hydraulic generation capacity  on the horizon 2030 the pniec foresees that an additional storage capacity of 6 gw with a minimum of two hours of storage at maximum load as well as 5 new gw of solar thermal power plants with molten salt storage whose precise composition and operation will be developed based on the technological evolution and availability  further it is planned to have more storage capacity associated with other systems such as distributed systems behind the meter or flexibility services that can provide the fleet of electric vehicles  sectoral decarbonization in summary security of electric supply is achieved by increasing the storage capacity around a 30 compared to what will be available that year  renewable for storage in any of its forms all of it determined by the capacity analyzes carried out by the system operator in the different horizons temporary and integrated into the capacity mechanisms in accordance with the principles established in the regulations european internal electric market  in addition society must perceive that the existing electrical infrastructures are used appropriately what is necessary to optimize its use maximizing the capacity of electric corridors and introducing a management dynamics of the network that allows to increase the effective capacities of evacuation and transport  the development of big data give

relevance in consumption and emissions from road transport for both goods and passengers  new business models figure of the aggregator to manage the storage capacity of electric vehicles  this scenario allows to overcome the vision of the city as an energy sink or even of the concept of a building with almost zero energy consumption going to energy positive buildings or districts namely share it with the rest of your built environment  smart applications and the interaction between buildings and the power grid promote flexibility the resilience of the system and the capacity to adapt to the impacts of climate change on the generation and distribution of energy  thus considering which ones to use scarcity and supply risks must be addressed as well as the volatility of the prices of critical raw materials and rare earths as they could hamper prospects for sustainability the sections below try to give a global vision of what the trends may be in these key aspects beginning with the possible evolution of productive activity continuing through the technological areas in which further progress is expected and due to the main challenges and opportunities that decarbonisation poses for the sector and by latest proposing the complementary economic instruments that could contribute to preserve the competitiveness of national and european industry  in the case of steel for example spain already has a high steel production capacity based on electric arc from scrap in addition there are still some barriers to using secondary steel in some applications  in addition it will be important to promote greater resilience of the agricultural sector to the impacts of climate change which in many cases implies an increase in the co fixation capacity of the sector 4 challenges and opportunities the agricultural sector in spain is of great economic importance social best practices and techniques available and the evolution of certain technologies will allow the sector to be less and less emitter and also improve its capacity as a co sink  increase in the catchment capacity of landfills from the year 2030 to reach 30 in 2040 and 2050  in the case of mitigation cost

production amounted to 4  emissions from electric and district heating fell by 24 per cent between 1990 and 2018  this reduction is mainly due to biofuel and waste having been substituted for fossil fuels in electric and district heating production  the reduction is mainly due to heating with oil being replaced by district heating and heat pumps  emissions caused by district heating and electric used in the sector are not covered here but instead included under electric and district heating production  these include expansion of carbon dioxide-free electric production hydroelectric power and nuclear power and more recently bio-energy and wind power expansion of the district heating network and increased use of biofuels and waste fuels in district heating production a shift from oil-fired

" many innovative companies are operating in switzerland and the cleantech sector is well represented  the swiss recycling system performs well and companies are increasingly taking on board the concept of a circular econmy  additional potential lies in the development of less greenhouse-gas-intensive foodstuffs in which swiss companies are playing a leading role  it will also ensure that sectors and companies facing international competition do not suffer any disadvantages vis-à-vis their competitors  the current technology fund which guarantees loans to innovative companies will also be incorporated into the climate fund  much of industry receives a full refund on the co2 levy and in return is subject to other instruments companies in sectors of the economy whose competitiveness is adversely affected by the oco2 levy can obtain exemptions from the duty  the new co2 act is to make this option available to all companies  this gives swiss companies access to the european market for emission rights  in public transport disincentives to switch from diesel-fuelled buses to buses with lower greenhouse gas emissions will be eliminated as the partial mineral oil tax rebate for licensed transport companies gradually expires initially in local transport from 2026 and also in regional passenger transport from 2030 unless topographical conditions prevent climate-friendly alternatives  some farms using greenhouse production and processing companies are already taking advantage of this option  it covers insurance companies pension institutions and foundations on one hand  these include banks fund management companies and investment firms  the various financial market actors are closely interlinked with one another but also with sectors in the real economy such as buildings industry and transport in particular via the domestic mortgage and lending market and investments in swiss and foreign companies  on the other the various financial market actors create incentives through advisory services products/services or conditions for companies and households which have a range of impacts from a climate perspective  through their investment and financing decisions dialogue with companies and political activities they also influence climate-relevant developments in the real econ-omy  this means the financial market actors are still currently investing too heavily in companies that plan or promote an expansion of the production of co2-intensive technologies gas-fired plants the transportation of oil and gas petrol and diesel vehicles etc 57 in this area too the climate impacts are comparable with those of listed companies on the global market which is not in line with the goal of the paris agreement  for example more than half of the institutions which indicate that they exclude coal from their investments still hold equities and bonds of companies that mine coal or produce coal-based electric  in the agriculture and foodsect the following climate-relevant in-struments are in force or being planned the funding of research and advisory projects enables the decision-making basis for agricultural policy to be established and support to be provided for agricultural businesses with implementation of scientific findings in practice  two resources projects have been running in the field of climate protection since 2016 a measures-based points system for greater climate protection on farming businesses is being created and applied as part of the ip-suisse project  distributors of nutrients in the form of fertilisers and fodder also undertake to disclose their deliveries to agricultural businesses  this makes it difficult to develop generally applicable and simple measures and to assess greenhouse gas emissions accurately at the level of the individual agricultural businesses  thus far investors have not primarily focused on the impact they could have on containing climate change but instead on the impact that climate change or its containment could have on their assets climate risks for investors  institutional investors have large portions of their assets invested in the swiss real estate market

innovation  the current level of compensation abroad with projects that reduce emissions and there-fore substitute reductions in switzerland is to be increasingly replaced long-term through international commitment in the field of negative emissions as domestic capacity for geological storage is limited  however a study conducted as part of the city of zur-ichs research programme shows that over half of people who have opted for a fossil-based system did not even consider a non-fossil alternative  the strengths of rail transport particularly the high transportation capacity on a small area and relatively low energy consumption with good capacity utilisation and technological innovations must be used in 36 an optimal way  it can be assumed that there is capacity available at least for several decades provided such geological co2 storage sites can be successfully developed  storage ca-pacity is in turn required for the total emissions removed of around 3  restrictive factors are the high energy usage possible conflicting priorities over the use of biomass the currently still high costs and the limited storage capacity  geological storage capacity is required for co2 emissions that are captured directly at an emis-sions source cement factory incinerator or directly from the atmosphere  if switzerland is dependent on capacity abroad for depositing co2 there is a good chance that it will also one day be available  this would eliminate transport costs and the storage capacity available in switzerland would be available to domestic point sources cement factories incinerators or other large plants  energy research unit city of zurich report no  by aiming to cut its greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050 switzerland is making a contribution to the paris agreement that is in line with its climate policy responsibility and capacities  agriculture must utilise its full capacities for example in manure and soil management and livestock farming to reduce the emissions of methane and nitrous oxide  the significant renewable electric production particularly through photovoltaic systems can be integrated into the power system if the national grids have the required capacities  annual storage capacities of at least five million tonnes of co2 would be required by 2050 and even more if ccs is used in the production of biochar and/or daccs  it is important that ccs and net capacities are developed over the coming years and then increased  the capacities required for ccs and net must be developed so that they can balance the remaining

roadmaps and the inventory of fixtures in morocco leads to identify four key themes the need to adopt a systemic approach through the integration of urban policies for new towns as well as existing ones the importance of the multi-scale approach and policy alignment organizational and technological the challenge of social inclusion underlying the implementation of policies because the building and the associated energy consumption constitutes a very large share of household budgets in particular for the most disadvantaged categories and the challenges of developing sustainable buildings in terms of industrial activity competitiveness and employment hpe households  from sectoral vision to strategy proposals for work on the building for the building sector demographic prospects and prospects for land use planning and housing particularly from the point of view of the organization of large cities small towns and finally rural areas morocco 2050 37 this housing forecast should in particular explore the type of habitat favored in the new towns or districts collective and individual the development of the tertiary sector must be studied in parallel in order to assess the needs in dedicated buildings in the different regions a typology of building and energy solutions adapted to the different regional conditions in climatic zoning terms must make it possible to characterize typical energy consumption and the associated needs in equipment the prospective quantification of energy needs and associated emissions should be based on on at  from sectoral vision to strategy proposals for work on transport for transport term must go territory and organization of cities forecasting of transport flows must be based on the analysis of four different segments in a quadrant passenger/goods transport and urban/interurban transport for each of the four segments the infrastructure needs should first be identified starting with rail infrastructure for intercity or public transit for towns morocco 2050 41 in addition to this infrastructure planning public transport of people and rail transport of goods logistics plan sociological prospects for the electrification of different categories of vehicles scooters light commercial vehicles must be quantified for different time horizons by distinguishing a phasing niche markets these elements may also be the subject of specific discussions including on the consequences of this rise in power of electric motorization for industry morocco in terms of development of charging infrastructure vehicles incentive schemes for the development of low-carbon mobility zero emission vehicles fossil fuels with investment aid for the conversion of vehicles  this assessment should include a report on the use of surfaces social and

the transport education training for new skills and awareness reduction of ch4 emissions from enteric fermentation in rising is also defined  long-term strategy on climate action and action plan the capacity need assessment has also demonstrated that all line ministries need capacities and knowledge to be fully capable to integrate climate change aspects into their sectoral plans and programs  report on institutional analysis and assessment of administrative capacity needs for climate action  the electric power generation capacity in republic of north macedonia in 2018 mainly consisted of two thermal power plants with a total of 824 megawatts mw installed capacity eight large hydropower plants with 556 8 mw installed capacity 96 small hydropower plants with 106 32 mw installed capacity one wind power plant with installed capacity of 36 8 mw and three combined heat and power chp plants with 287 mw installed capacity  however the paris agreement establishes a new enhanced transparency framework etf providing for the reporting and review of information on ghg emissions on progress made to implement and achieve the ndc mitigation on impacts and adaptation and technology capacity and financial support needed and received or were applicable provided and mobilized  however as identified in the process of development of the third biennial update report there is still a lack of adequate mechanisms and instruments in place especially financial ones such as carbon taxation as well as capacity constraints for fostering low carbon and climate resilient development  nonetheless despite relatively low compared to neighbouring countries including eu member states republic of north macedonias gdp has been showing an increasing trend in the most recent decades thus contributing to an increase in the capacity to adapt to the impacts of climate change  in the human health sector republic of north macedonia leads in terms of preparedness to address extreme heat and cold through the implementation of the national climate change health adaptation strategy and the respective heat wave and cold weather action plans for the remaining relevant sectors namely waterresources agriculture forestry tourism and cultural heritage the countrys adaptive capacity is still low as the policy framework is still incipient  despite the wealth of information and of the good practices in adaptation policy planning and implementation described above republic of north macedonia still faces a set of important gaps and barriers which limit the countrys capacity to effectively adapt to climate change  in this context the measures included in this strategy and action plan will focus on addressing the gaps and barriers identified in the area of data availability consistency and transparency as well as in the areas of institutional capacity and climate scenario development and analysis  the technological advancement of the res technologies especially the ones related to wind and solar generation has substantially reduced the relevant installation and operation costs making wind and solar capacity able to offer very competitive prices in the wholesale electric markets  above all accurate real-time air-climate-health data is important for the whole society and significant improvement of the processes for collection and dissemination of such data is crucial for the adaptive capacity of the sector human health  overall climate change framework needs to be managed and supervised by competent authorities where significantly enhanced capacity is needed as a pre-condition for sustainable implementation monitoring and reporting of mitigation policies and measures  ownership growth elasticity relative to income growth is calculated  tonnes-kilometers light duty vehicles short distance buses intercity rail passengerpassenger mil 8 twh in 2050 due to the increase in the generation capacity as a more cost-effective long-term option compared to new lignite power plants on imported coal long-term strategy on climate action and action plan considering the co tax as well  electric generation by type of technology currently the installed capacity of power plants in the country is 1  therefore in the wem scenario an additional capacity of 2  by 2050 an additional capacity of 0  regarding the res potential the installed capacity of hydropower plants will increase for around 1 gw in 2050 which is more than double compared to 2017  the installed capacity of large hydropower plants in the analyzed 2017 is estimated at 556 8 mw while the wam scenario envisages the installed capacity of the large hydropower plants to increase by an additional 808 mw by 2040/2050  in addition it is recommended the capacity of the watersupply systems to be used for small hydropower plants if justified according to economic and technical assessments  the highest increase is estimated for the installed capacity of the pv power plants or around 1 2 gw of additional capacity will be included in the power system by 2050  hence in 2050 the share of the res in the total installed capacity will be 81 or 40 for hydropower plants 27 for pv 13 for wind and almost 1 for biogas power plants 14 gw additional capacity of power plants on natural gas is estimated to enter the power system by 2030 conversion of hfo tpp to natural gas besides the res capacity  the analysis shows that the natural gas units will be used mainly for balancing of the grid having in mind the res installed capacity especially after 2030  same as in the wem scenario the highest increase is estimated for the installed capacity of res  by 2050 the installed capacity of hydropower will increase for around 1 gw the capacity of pv power plants for 2 1 gw and the capacity of wind power plants for 0  in terms of their share in the total installed capacity hydropower plants will participate with 35 pv power plants with 41 and the wind power plants with 19  installed capacity by type of technology the price of electric in both wem and wam scenarios increases as a result of the increase of the co 2tax and investments in new capacities primarily on renewable energy sources figure 12  the goals of the research plan for biodiversity including agrobiodiversity and climate change are to include identification of important gaps in the information needed by sectoral decision-makers to respond to climate change in ways that reduce the vulnerability of biodiversity to the impacts of climate change set adaptation research priorities based on these gaps identify capacity that can be harnessed or that needs development in order to perform priority adaptation research  accurate real-time or close to real-time data and the capacity to make information such as alerts for events such as heat or cold waves or exceeding of air quality thresholds available to the wider public is key for the adaptive capacity in the human health sector  republic of north macedonias capacity in the area of interaction between climate change and human health is high nonetheless efforts are required to restore it to previous levels namely through bringing back online the communication platform among the hydrometeorological service the public health institute and the general public  however the capacity need assessment done in the framework of the project has also demonstrated that all line

construction of res capacities for which it is necessary to create sustainable policies and a stable investment climate  long-term strategy on climate action and action plan the capacity need assessment has also demonstrated that all line ministries need capacities and knowledge to be fully capable to integrate climate change aspects into their sectoral plans and programs  this means that climate consideration should be brought higher on the political agenda of the government in order for the country to allocate resources to engage additional human capacities at all levels  this will assure the systematic and harmonised integration of climate related aspects into the national educational r&d and innovation ecosystem as well as increase educational and research capacities and climate awareness among the general public  in addition investing in resilience and building adaptation capacities is crucial for dealing with the adverse effects of climate change and developing an enabling and sustainable environment for investments and economic development  the current institutional capacities for climate mainstreaming in the country are low and significant effort is required to establish the national system for climate action in the country  this refers not only to the national legal framework and institutional capacities but also to a comprehensive enabling environment for climate action to the allocation of public and private funding and to public participation and education  the law on climate action law or lca is expected to set a profound change in the climate capacities of the country as well as to enhance cross-sectoral policy coordination and climate mainstreaming in the country  such vulnerability to climate change is exacerbated by the countrys specificities namely being landlocked the diversity of the biomes eight distinct ones the geography including tall mountains and deep valleys four main river basins and three large natural lakes  finally investing in resilience and building adaptation capacities is crucial to deal with the adverse effects of climate change and to provide an enabling and sustainable environment for economic investments and development  this will assure systematic and harmonised integration of the climate related aspects in the national educational r&d and innovation ecosystem as well as will increase the educational and the research capacities and the climate awareness of the general public  after 2030 the net import of electric is slightly higher compared to the wem scenario to satisfy the remaining part of the electric consumption that could not be covered by the installed power generation capacities in the wam scenario  the growing electric demand requires additional generating capacities  installed capacity by type of technology the price of electric in both wem and wam scenarios increases as a result of the increase of the co 2tax and investments in new capacities primarily on renewable energy sources figure 12  although this increase appears to be drastic it should be noted that due to the world crisis european crises and introduction of environmental standards in the industry sector there was closing and reopening of some of the major industry capacities in republic of north macedonia in the recent period 2012-2017  however it is assumed that all these capacities will restart and in 2025 the final energy consumption will be at the 2012 level and in 2030 it will be at 2007 level  the decrease of the biomass consumption is driven by the replacement of inefficient biomass stoves with high efficient biomass stoves for example pellet stoves as well as their replacement with heat pumps due to the air pollution problem in the cities and the current strong policy of the government for subsidizing heat pumps and more efficient biomass stoves  biodiversity define and develop an indicator system to monitor the impacts of climate change on

population density and abundance vegetation map - communities and habitats insufficient definition of biogeographical characteristics of macedonian territory lack of data on vulnerable biodiversity components to climate change a monitoring system of climate change impacts on biodiversity does not exist lack of good intersectoral cooperation partially insufficient capacities human and knowledge partially climate change may have significant impacts on biodiversity  resources and capacities are to be available for the regular and accurate collection management and analysis of the data for the indicator  in the scope of this measure the following activities are to be implemented 1 define policy relevant key indicators for evaluation of impacts of climate change on biodiversity a assess data needs and data availability and gaps including resources needed to address needs and gaps 2 design and establish monitoring system for the impacts of climate change on biodiversity including institutional responsibilities define a national research plan for biodiversity and climate change this measure specifically aims at addressing the following needs and gaps identified in the third national communication lack of data for precise distribution of different species population density and abundance vegetation map - communities and habitats insufficient definition of biogeographical characteristics of macedonian territory lack of good intersectoral cooperation partially insufficient capacities human and knowledge partially biodiversitys vulnerability to climate change is well established globally and in republic of north macedonia  an index-based vulnerability assessment is a comprehensive tool that helps in comparing and ranking areas cities regions or communities in terms of vulnerability thus facilitating priority setting and the definition of adaptation measures targeted at the specific vulnerabilities of each community  this would assure the systematic and harmonised integration of climate related aspects into the national educational r&d and innovation ecosystem as well as increase educational and research capacities and climate awareness  the country is considered the most prominent and experienced in the region when it comes to national capacities for reporting towards the unfccc  climate mainstreaming in the country may be significantly improved by enhanced institutional capacities and the establishment of sound mechanisms for inter-sectoral cooperation  currently the climate capacities of the moepp are limited especially in terms of technical expertise for reporting towards international organisations as well as for monitoring and reporting of policies measures and projections  however the capacity need assessment done in the framework of the project has also demonstrated that all line ministries need capacities and knowledge to be fully capable to integrate climate change aspects into their sectoral plans and programs  this means that climate consideration should be brought higher on the political agenda of the government in order for the country to allocate the necessary funds to engage additional human capacities at all levels  the lack of financial and human capacities for the systematic support of climate awareness raising in the country limit the outreach of the moepp  climate change education would increase climate literacy raise awareness and strengthen relevant national capacities  at the same time the annualized investments in the power sector in wam scenario are increased for around 20 compared to wem as a result of the increased investments in res capacities  private investors private and state-owned companies also play an important role in this process of transition mainly for construction of res capacities for which it is necessary to create sustainable policies and a stable investment climate  the action plan on gender and climate change recommends implementation of the following actions that will increase the knowledge awareness and climate mainstreaming in the country take a stronger lead on gender equality in the climate change arena by promoting gender-inclusive policy dialogue and accountability as well as platform for action in national climate change planning processes international climate change negotiations and the emerging climate finance architecture create enabling organisational environments for effective gender mainstreaming by addressing mainstreaming fatigue institutionalising the application of existing gender commitments to climate change portfolios providing gender and climate change tools covering the entire project or programme cycle and addressing institutional disconnects between gender and climate change responsibilities fill knowledge and best practice gaps in participatory ways that capture mens womens and young peoples ideas and knowledge particularly in areas where the gender dimensions of climate change impacts and responses are not immediately obvious such as transport and infrastructure energy access housing and formal or informal employment improve the understanding of gendered impacts of climate change and of climate change policy and programme impacts by establishing monitoring and evaluation frameworks that disaggregate participation in policy and programme design and implementation by gender and age and measure the impacts of climatic variations as well as adaptation and low-carbon development strategies on gender relations and inequalities particularly for strategies at the national and regional levels and for low-carbon development promote gender-responsive international climate negotiations by facilitating multistakeholder processes that are inclusive in a horizontal and vertical sense promoting the inclusion of marginalised voices and making gender a core issue as opposed to a side event address the gender disconnect in project and programme cycles by ensuring that thorough gender analyses of the gender inequalities and women and mens girls and boys different roles preferences needs and capacities underlying each context are better entrenched in implementation monitoring and evaluation promote equal access to decision-making processes and new opportunities created by responses to climate change by promoting the reduction of legal infrastructural and other barriers to womens participation in decision-making markets and particularly processes related to new technologies by making climate change decisions and funding processes transparent and accessible and by training womens organisations to take part in and lead such processes promote gender-responsiveness in emerging funds and policies for adaptation and low-carbon development by integrating gender into results frameworks and xii disbursement processes long-term strategy on climate action and action plan supporting the development of best practice for gender responsiveness in clean technology and transport choices and processes and by bundling and thereby reducing the transaction costs of small-scale initiatives that tend to have more gender co-benefits 9  this will assure the systematic and

in context of climate change sectors is confirmed by the gender indicators with lower or very low female participation in decision making processes in the climate change related sectors and low employment rate of women in the high ghg emitting sectors  women are also less represented as employees at individual agricultural holdings and business entities which reflects their economic dependence and lower capacity to decide on the usage of measures related to mitigation/adaptation  in addition the access to resources is more limited since women are dominating the category of unpaid family workers in the agricultural holdings and therefore they are not provided approach to the financial instruments in terms of developing climate resilient practices  the action plan on gender and

disconnects between gender and climate change responsibilities fill knowledge and best practice gaps in participatory ways that capture mens womens and young peoples ideas and knowledge particularly in areas where the gender dimensions of climate change impacts and responses are not immediately obvious such as transport and infrastructure energy access housing and formal or informal employment improve the understanding of gendered impacts of climate change and of climate change policy and programme impacts by establishing monitoring and evaluation frameworks that disaggregate participation in policy and programme design and implementation by gender and age and measure the impacts of climatic variations as well as adaptation and low-carbon development strategies on gender relations and inequalities particularly for strategies at the national and regional levels and for low-carbon development promote gender-responsive international climate negotiations by facilitating multistakeholder processes that are inclusive in a horizontal and vertical sense promoting the inclusion of marginalised voices and making gender a core issue as opposed to a side event address the gender disconnect in project and programme cycles by ensuring that thorough gender analyses of the gender inequalities and women and mens girls and boys different roles preferences needs and capacities underlying each context are better entrenched in implementation monitoring and evaluation promote equal access to decision-making processes and new opportunities created by responses to climate change by promoting the reduction of legal infrastructural and other barriers to womens participation in decision-making markets and particularly processes related to new technologies by making climate change decisions and funding processes transparent and accessible and by training womens organisations to take part in and lead such processes promote gender-responsiveness in emerging

experience the impacts of climate change and develop strategies to adapt to or mitigate them  on the other hand climate change negative impacts are increasing the already existing gender inequality  as a mater of fact gender inequality increases the vulnerability  in this context gender inequality should be emphasized in social cultural social economic but also in terms of practicing the services and services provided by the state in the area of mitigation and adaptation to climate change  following the paris agreement preamble as well as the enhanced lima work programme on gender lwpg this

impacts of climate change and of climate change policy and programme impacts by establishing monitoring and evaluation frameworks that disaggregate participation in policy and programme design and implementation by gender and age and measure the impacts of climatic variations as well as adaptation and low-carbon development strategies on gender relations and inequalities particularly for strategies at the national and regional levels and for low-carbon development promote gender-responsive international climate negotiations by facilitating multistakeholder processes that are inclusive in a horizontal and vertical sense promoting the inclusion of marginalised voices and making gender a core issue as opposed to a side event address the gender disconnect in project and programme cycles by ensuring that thorough gender analyses of the gender inequalities and women and mens girls and boys different roles preferences needs and capacities underlying each context are better entrenched in implementation monitoring and evaluation promote equal access to decision-making processes and new opportunities created by responses to climate change by promoting the reduction of legal infrastructural and other barriers to womens participation in decision-making markets and particularly processes related to new technologies by making climate change decisions and funding processes transparent and accessible and by training womens organisations to take part in and lead such processes promote gender-responsiveness in emerging funds and policies for adaptation and

are that the existing interconnector or an additional one could be used the existing ccgt plants could have their operating lifetimes extended if their capacity factors are reduced and/or battery

actions that the bicentennial in 2050 in a manner consistent with the long-term goal of limiting government has identified to implement the decarbonization of the the increase of average global temperature to 1  technological institutional and economic changes  the country has been efficiently converting its gdp begins by determining what changes - institutional market price growth into social progress while the investment in natural capital regulatory among others - must be realized to fulfill the trajectory has protected biodiversity and increased income from ecotourism  more particularly to analyze both for each axis the plan contemplates policy packages that the impacts of decarbonization in the labor market and the best combine concrete planning institutional or regulatory measures practices of a just transition towards the fourth industrial revolution project implementation access to financing ensuring citizen and decarbonization is offered  - defining the emissions but do not lead to zero-emissions e starting the process of institutional requirements of decarbonization is crucial to responding two cross-cutting reforms in 2018 without which the decarbonization with certainty to the question what instance is responsible for of the costa rican economy will be unfeasible the structural reform decarbonizing the economy? moreover cross-cutting strategies must for a new national institutionality that will lay the foundations for a be explicit in order to enhance change  hence eight cross-cutting areas new system of sustainable consumption and production and a green were identified a comprehensive reform for the new institutionality tax reform to promote actions towards sustainable development and of the bicentennial b green tax reform c funding strategy and growth without emissions thereby reducing the negative externalities investment attraction d digitalization and knowledge-based that deteriorate the natural capital  general comptroller of the republic the majority of public entities associated with the protection of biodiversity do not have adequate institutional performance index ratings except for the national forest deforestation and absorption financing fund fonafifo  as the threats to biodiversity increase - historically costa rica has operated over the years a gap is created and accordingly investments must its national system of protected wild be carried out in a better institutional management context - one areas and program of payments for that guarantees the protection of the natural capital  for instance under this vision the question related to the state fleets would be how can they be transformed so that the state fleet stops consuming fossil fuels? the planning is composed of two stages what technological and market changes must occur? and what institutional fiscal regulatory and social changes must be achieved to enhance these technological changes? planning for decarbonization sets the tone to answer both questions pdf1188emphasizing the institutional regulatory and fiscal changes planning for decarbonization provides actions distributed into that will be required so that the technological transformation three stages of changepathway can be fulfilled in expected times  in addition deep expanded upon in the action plan 2018-2022 located in the annex institutional changes will be implemented to reduce the barriers for and more generic actions are offered towards the long-term with change  both academic and institutional actors within mideplan the central bank and minae 5c scenario2266exchange and consultation with diverse actors the decarbonization planning methodology included a process with stakeholders from sectoral autonomous and subnational level institutions as well as from the privatesect civil society and academy  first the process included a series of bilateral meetings with key stakeholders and authorities at the level of ministers and executive presidents of central institutions  therefore this document refers to policy packages which are packages defined as a set of measures that does not only plan a change but also empower finance and support institutional capacities and eliminate barriers that may hinder their adoption  institutional or regulatory change action  requires capacitbuilding and/or approval as well as an understanding

fostering change such as those described actions within all sectors is who is responsible for the decarbonization in the previous section not only requires visionary public policies based on of the economy? is it the responsibility of the president or a particular data and with appropriate finance but also a management capacity that minister? should there be a high-level commission that would take lives up to the leadership the country needs to achieve decarbonization  charge of the decisions and monitor progress?undoubtedly costa rica has institutions that have achieved great milestones - in issues like education health and trade  however the there is no universal model and each country should decide based on country must also modernize and modify its institutional and regulatory its governance model  monitoring of progress requires an institutional innovation that goes beyond the environmental and/or climate sector  or reform or to contravene the procedure of institutional use  indeed the purpose of the instructional requirements for transformation given the previous statement planning this decarbonization requires answers the question of what model of government management is a need to identify actions that foster change aimed at achieving required in order for carbonization to be reversed?decarbonization and complemented by a institutional requirements b cross-cutting measures and c considerations on impact management  in this context an identification of the need to design institutional these are discussed below  some changes that are proposed will require laws institutional requirements for transformation adjustments that will take time  hence while they are developed an initial or transitory proposal of articulation is required to further one of the fundamental institutional questions given the promote the decarbonization agenda and this would include the transformational nature of decarbonization and the inclusion of following structures 62 a

be promoted with the institution  promote change new institutional framework for sustainable mobility given the in addition to the governance model for decarbonization that will importance of shifting the city model and the inclusion of new execute the plans and lead in this field cross-cutting tasks are required paradigms such as a public transport-oriented development the in at least eight areas redesigning of the institutional framework associated with public transport and urban planning is necessary  comprehensive reform for the new institutionality capacity to integrate and manage urban planning development of the bicentennial and transportation planning processes  governance options have to be evaluated based on examples and international best practices the country needs to develop the project of institutional reform and their advantages and disadvantages in the costa rican context in order to endow the country with a modern digitized flexible have to be taken into consideration  of the options to be explored institutionality with the capacity to manage the disruptive changes there includes the creation of an urban transport authority amongst that the new economy entails  the changes must be seen in an others to better consolidate the processes of transport-oriented integral way and include institutions of the central level along with development autonomous institutions and municipalities  the new institutional framework must base its actions on results to guarantee natural for these processes macro aspects will be analyzed within the 64framework of the committee of

severe negative impacts of climate change due to its fragile economy weak resilience and low adaptive capacity as much of the economy is dependent on climate-sensitive ecosystems and natural resources  the 2050 pathways platform provides a space for collective problem solving through the development of long-term deep decarbonization strategies including the sharing of resources finance capacity

" these green loans consist of assigning a loan to the private financial sector which thus manage to capture an entity for which the interest rate payable will depend investment to be used in business activities that promote on the companys ability to meet the environmental decarbonisation and the more efficient use of resources  project such as for example grants for training and technical assistance investment in the companys capital secured loans among others  the decision makers in these areas should be mobilised and made aware of the importance of introducing these subjects into the curricula at various education levels but also of the development of specific programs for training company employees for the new technologies and practices that will help the occupational retraining of workers in the sectors affected by decarbonisation  indeed in areas such as energy and industry covered by the european emissions trading scheme ets the carbon dimension is now part of the strategic and economic considerations of the companies concerned  by companies e  this instrument covers various policy areas such as sustainable infrastructure research innovation and digitisation small and medium-sized companies and the decarbonisation of the economy in the next decade  that is they are funds that seek given by the international capital market association to acquire shares and/or bonds of companies that have icma green bond principles and the european demonstrated sustainability practices it is also important to mention the carbon price instruments that aim to internalise the carbon price in companies strategic and operational decisions and promote the adoption by operators of lower cost measures that aim to reduce emissions another positive aspect of carbon neutrality lies in increased investment and employment in research innovation and development activities which should cover the development or refinement of technologies that enable decarbonisation and also the development of new business models and the mobilisation of families and companies to work towards the decarbonisation objectives in the business world there is also a growing number of companies that have been integrating climate change as a critical factor in their business strategies and external communication thus adopting a series of concrete actions that reduce their ghg emissions and/or call for changes in the behaviour of their consumers  this coverage has internalised in these companies the environmental cost of greenhouse gas emissions since such emissions have an associated cost  many companies are already using this information in their communication with consumers their suppliers and other stakeholders suggesting that many are aware of and interested in the social transformation associated with decarbonisation to generalise these trends it is necessary to focus on raising awareness and training of corporate decision makers and employees to adopt sustainable production and service delivery methods that contribute to the fight against climate change in particular by exploiting strategic themes such as the potential for ghg emissions reduction that their companies can achieve the importance of integrating and safeguarding decarbonisation in their supply chains the dissemination of good practices in terms of communication with consumers and enhancing transparency through tools such as the carbon footprint the diffusion of new technologies and promotion of an environment for dialogue between research innovation and development and the business world the importance of eco-design of energy efficiency the circularity of production processes and materials encouraging the use of by-products from other industries and the reduction or disposal of waste portuguese non-governmental organisations active in the most diverse thematic areas such as the environment cooperation for development human rights and local development have also given increasing importance to the theme of climate change contributing to citizens greater awareness and information and monitoring the actions of businesses public bodies and policy decisions in this field according to the special climate change eurobarometer of 2017 the portuguese expressed the following opinions 83 consider climate change a serious or very serious problem they consider that national governments 50 businesses and industry 48 the eu 38 local and regional authorities 36 should take action to combat climate change they believe that the impact on the economy and employment will be positive when combating climate change and promoting energy efficiency 87 and reducing fossil fuel imports 79 they consider it important for the government to set national targets for increasing the use of renewable energy 94 they consider that the transition to clean energy should be supported financially and that fossil fuel subsidies should be reduced 82 and that the government should support energy efficiency particularly in the residential sector 93 20 consider themselves personally responsible for taking action 60 say they have recently taken actions in the sense of combating climate change these results suggest that the portuguese as consumers and citizens acknowledge climate change as a problem but expect the government businesses and local and regional authorities to act  it is also important to mobilise the demand side to increase its interest in more sustainable financial products and to publicise the importance of decarbonisation issues to businesses and consumers portuguese non-governmental organisations active in the most diverse thematic areas such as the environment cooperation for development human rights and local development

also given increasing importance to the theme of climate change contributing to citizens greater awareness and information and monitoring the actions of businesses public bodies and policy decisions in this field in this context it will be essential to ensure a stable and competitive regulatory framework that guarantees the involvement and commitment of the main actors public and private with implementation of the measures necessary to achieve the defined objectives thus providing stability for investors in the most diverse sectors  as such there is a need for the projects risk-return profile that is to improve detailed information on the destination of the funding its commercial viability for the private investor  the raised and there is also a need for annual reporting to existence of blended finance means that it is possible investors on the use of the capital and the impact of the to combine several types of financing for the same investments in this context it will be essential to guarantee the existence of a stable and competitive regulatory framework that ensures the mobilisation of public and private financial flows for implementation of the measures necessary to achieve the stated objectives thereby providing investors with stability in the various sectors  contributing to national resilience and capacity to adapt to climate change vulnerabilities and impactsp the rnc2050 sets the path to carbon neutrality in a sustained manner establishes the main guidelines and identifies cost-effective options to achieve this end in different socio-economic development scenariosaccomplishing carbon neutrality in portugal implies reducing greenhouse gas emissions by more than 85 compared to 2005 and ensuring an agricultural and forestry carbon sequestration capacity of around 13 million tonnes realisation of this strategic vision rests on eight key premises described in more detail in the following sections i ipromote the transition to a competitive circular resilient and carbon neutral economy generating more wealth employment and well-beingii identify decarbonisation vectors and lines of action that underlie the route to carbon neutrality by 2050 iii contribute to resilience and the national capacity to adapt to climate change vulnerabilities and impactsiv stimulate research innovation and knowledge production in key areas

adoption of carbon neutral objectives in the sectoral areasviii involve society in the challenges of climate change focusing on education information and awareness raising contributing to increasing individual and collective action 2from the modelling performed it is clear that given the scale of the challenge zero net emissions by 2050 all sectors will be called upon to contribute either by

necessary to ensure an increase in the organic matter content of the land area used for pasture focusing in particular on areas with sown improved permanent and biodiverse pastures in order to increase their sequestration capacity  finally it will be necessary to ensure an increase in the organic matter content of agricultural lands and a consequent increase in sequestering capacity notably by increasing the area under conservation or regenerative agriculture reaching 180000ha by 2050 and by increasing the area under biological farming and/or replacement of mineral fertilisation with organic fertilisation  contributing to national resilience and capacity to adapt to climate change vulnerabilities and impactsaccording to the european commission9 1total economic losses resulting from meteorological and other extreme weather events in europe between 1980 and 2016 amounted to over eur 436 billion and in portugal this figure was around eur 7 billion  increased frequency and intensity of extreme phenomena that cause coastal removal and erosionit should be noted that there is a series of decarbonisation measures and options with clear synergies in adapting to the effects of climate change such as for example measures contributing to forest and agricultural sequestration increasing soil organic matter and its water retention capacity combating desertification natural-based solutions installing roofs and other green infrastructures in urban areas renaturalisation of impermeable areas etc in this regard it is also particularly important to note that the determining factor in forest carbon sink capacity - a decrease in the annual average burned area - will be hampered in a scenario of worsening of the effects of climate change it is therefore undeniable that the implementation of adaptation measures becomes one of the critical factors for the carbon neutrality targets as regards both emissions reduction and sequestration capacity 11000 m

with a positive impact on their energy performance  these aspects are important for shaping the future of residential and service buildings especially in cities  in big cities they are primarily responsible for the poor quality of the air  this effect will be particularly significant in cities due to the transformation that will take place in terms of mobility with the emphasis on public

phases of the elaboration of the rnc2050 and allowed for a wide public discussion of its results  the participation of science takes place at the most diverse levels by monitoring and tracking climate change and modelling future climate change and its impacts by accurately estimating the emission or sequestration levels that each process or sector produces and the monitoring and follow-up of these emissions over time while also considering new important sectors or areas in line with the development of scientific knowledge according to the ipcc guidelines for developing production processes or new technologies that lead to a strong reduction in emissions or a strong increase in sequestration by developing dissemination strategies and/or business models that allow the transfer of the best technologies and their adoption by economic sectors and households by ex ante and ex post evaluation of policies and measures and their effectiveness in reducing emissions and in their environmental dimension but also by assessing their economic impact on employment and prediction of the sectors or territories affected positively and negatively by these policies by designing incentive systems that facilitate the adoption of less emitting practices and technologies or of disincentive policies that deter the continuation or adoption of more emitting practices by identifying long-term decarbonisation strategies and vectors for carbon neutrality in turn the process of defining carbon neutrality trajectories informs the science agenda about the areas sectors and technologies for which the identification of decarbonisation solutions is most significant and therefore most effective and/or that are the areas in which decarbonisation is now more conditioned or less cost-effective and therefore more difficult to achieve therefore it is important to promote the science and knowledge of climate change at a national level to stimulate research and development of low carbon

awareness and contribute to increasing individual and collective actionunderstanding the problem of climate change and mobilising citizens economic actors and policy makers to reduce ghg emissions and promoting societys adaptation to a world with a changing climate are prerequisites for the success of any climate policy these results suggest that the portuguese as consumers and citizens acknowledge climate change as a problem but expect the government businesses and local and regional authorities to act portuguese non-governmental organisations active in the most diverse thematic areas such as the environment cooperation for development human rights and local development have also given increasing importance to the theme of climate change contributing to citizens greater awareness and information and monitoring the actions of businesses public bodies and policy decisions in this field this task will always have a special focus on the citizen and in this regard it will be necessary to continue communicating what climate change is how it manifests itself and how it evolves educating about the climate impact of consumption choices and individual behaviours on emissions and ways to reduce these impacts reinforcing the role of agents of change among the economic actors as consumers of goods and services facilitating access to information on the impact of goods and services consumed and creating a culture that demands that policy makers and economic and financial actors at all levels make decisions that lead to effective climate action  the transition to a carbon neutral economy requires timely long-term planning to take advantage of the opportunities associated with the transformation of the existing economy and to establish the basis of trust with the citizens and economic agents that this change is possible advantageous and timely the achievement of a cohesive transition with the active participation of entities at different levels of territorial organisation of regional agents and those closest to the citizen can be better ensured by a deeper understanding of rnc2050 at a sectoral regional and/or inter-municipal level  thus it is essential to outline the best way to achieve this goal by aligning action in key areas investing in realistic and cost-effective technological solutions promoting active citizen participation and ensuring a fair transition

leadership group  by extending the coverage to 2050 the impact of decommissioning eskomcid182s coal fired generation capacity on the long-term requirements for new capacity is clearer  according to the irp the decommissioning schedule shows that about 10599 mw of eskomcid182s coal generation capacity will be decommissioned by 2030 with the figure increasing to 35000 mw by 2050  for reference the

within the second half of this century and towards carbon neutrality by 2065 while looking forward to enhanced international cooperation and support on finance technology and capacity-building to achieve this ambition  in this regard international cooperation and financial technological and capacity-building support are critically important to support thailands efforts to make this necessary transition towards a sustainable future  thailand must prioritize and speedily develop its new infrastructure especially the energy and transport system by increasing the share of renewable electric generation at least 50 of new power generation capacity by 2050 and the share of new vehicles in the market to be electric vehicles at least 69 by 2035  it consists of three key strategies i climchangeadapt which aims to build climate resilience by integrating policies and measures in all sectors ii mitigation and low carbon development which facilitates the development of mechanisms for ghg emissions reduction and leads to sustainable low carbon growth and iii enabling environment for climate change management which desires to build capacity for climate change implementation by enhancing potential and awareness of stakeholders and developing database knowledge and technology to support climchangeadapt and mitigation  additionally supportive mechanisms for effective implementation of the sectoral action plans are considered in the areas such as research and development economic tools and mechanisms laws and regulations mrv system capacity building and stakeholder engagement  three key missions are i building climate resilience by integrating policies and measures in all sectors ii creating mechanisms to reduce ghg emissions leading to sustainable low carbon growth iii building readiness by enhancing capacity and awareness of stakeholders and iv developing a database knowledge and technology to support climchangeadapt and mitigation  this plan aims to

" company initiatives based on long-term perspectives  there is a growing possibility that the evaluation and assessment of a company will depend on whether or not it can promptly make transition to decarbonization  both domestic household and industrial electric rates have been higher than international standards due to the higher cost resulting from the increase in fossil fuels procurement following the shutdown of the nuclear power plants due to the accident at tokyo electric power companys fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant  given the considerable progress made at the individual company level the government will encourage collaboration among companies  company initiatives based on long-term perspectives keidanren has called on its member companies and organizations to consider their own long-term vision and provide information thereof  c promotion of open innovation using open innovation that goes beyond the collaboration among the industry academia and government and beyond the confines of a company the government will strive to achieve early commercialization and improve the productivity of next-generation electrification-related technologies which hold a key such as storage batteries fuel cells power semiconductors motors inverters material weight reduction wireless power supply and automobile solar charging systems  additionally by supporting the training on energy-saving construction techniques for carpenters in small and medium-sized construction company the government facilitates the development and strengthening of the energy efficient housing construction system for small and medium-sized local constructors  there is a rapid increase in servicizing such as leasing and renting of products and the esco energy service company focusing on the function of a product and providing that function of the product as a service rather than selling the ownership of the product making use of the iot and ai  reconstructing and building a decarbonized society in fukushima the accident at the tokyo electric power companys fukushima daiichi nuclear power station in march 2011 caused considerable injury to the people of fukushima prefecture and many others  this tcfd guidance may also be viewed as a specific attempt under the guidance for integrated corporate disclosure and company-investor dialogue for collaborative value creation the ministry of economy trade and industry meti may 2017 which sets a common narrative between the companies and investors it thus encourages the formation of corporate value creation stories in terms of action on climate change  in order to facilitate the dialogue between investors and companies a database to enable the comparison of information disclosed by each company will be required  outstanding initiatives and technologies for decarbonization of a company will not connect with investment unless they are visualized in such a way that can be properly assessed by investors or financial institutions  2 mobilizing finance through disclosure including the tcfd and dialogue the government seeks to utilize the tcfd the global climate-related financial disclosure framework to establish the virtuous cycle of environment and growth by visualizing individual companys climate-related technologies and initiatives as opportunities  a guidance for financial sectors will be formulated to provide the investors and ratings evaluation and other organizations with the key points in assessing a companys value using its disclosed climate change-related information  efforts to improve transparency and reduce ghg emissions under the international initiatives will help the international standings and in the long term manifest the resilience of the company in responding to the economic and social transition to a decarbonized society  in this context the government will facilitate efforts of companies to develop human resources in and out of the company to be engaged in management emphasizing environment and environmental protection and lead a green socio-economic system -- environmental human resources  promoting effective information disclosure by companies expanding on the tcfd guidance / scenario analysis guide  - 2 - capable communities and companies to achieve carbon neutrality even before 2050  nedo pitch for companies selected by public

mobilizing finance through disclosure including tcfd and dialogue tcfd task force on climate-related financial disclosures by utilizing tcfd a global framework for climate-related disclosures leading discussions on disclosures through which strength and contributions of companies are visualized while highlighting industry-specific characteristics thereby developing financial flow to capture opportunities from climate change  3 just transition providing vocational training to the workforce in order to achieve the transition of the workforce to a decarbonized society smoothly and without delay with the government local authorities and companies working together  energy transition with low-cost renewable energy and the trend of companies and financial sectors that aim at 7 the special report on strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change the impact of a 1  it could well be said that climate change measures are no longer a cost but a source of competitiveness among companies  in addition there are also moves that can lead to restraining the use of fossil fuels that emit large amounts of co2 including coal through engagement holding constructive dialogues with invested companies to encourage actions divestments withdrawing investment on assets related to fossil fuels including and especially coal-fired thermal power plants and others  for esg investment as well it is important to attempt growth in a longer term and improvement of corporate value in a sustainable manner through constructive dialogue and engagement between companies and investors based on the information disclosure  furthermore in order to secure necessary finance for such innovation and to promote investment for further innovation and measures it is important to direct the flow of global finance towards companies that work on innovation through visualization of their efforts in climate change actions and to build a system in which financing for decarbonization circulates through promotion of green finance  through these efforts a virtuous cycle in which companies challenging for disruptive innovation raise capital from the world and in turn enable further growth and actions  in addition in order to realize a virtuous cycle of environment and growth japan will prepare an environment that promotes and utilizes innovation for decarbonization at all levels including companies investors financial institutions consumers and local governments and brings about changes in lifestyle  furthermore the government will support each stakeholder including companies and local communities in sharing awareness for a decarbonized society forming a future vision of the society and taking proactive action  more specifically the government will particularly proceed with multi-faceted resource diplomacy including with the new lng supplying countries especially in the light of growing lng exports from the united states which has significantly impacted on the supply structure of fossil fuels following the shale revolution and russia with abundant resource potential in the arctic circle forming a highly flexible and transparent international lng market by for example introducing more flexibility into commercial practices such as destination restraints securing more active participation of japanese companies in the global lng business and development of domestic resources especially in natural gas and methane hydrate reserves in the seas surrounding japan  given the considerable progress made at the individual company level the government will encourage collaboration among companies  company initiatives based on long-term perspectives keidanren has called on its member companies and organizations to consider their own long-term vision and provide information thereof  by march 2019 over 250 companies and organizations have either formulated or are considering the formulation of their long-term vision  for example recently there has been an increasing number of companies that set sbts science based targets focusing on reduction targets across the entire supply chains in line with the goals of the paris agreement and those participated in re 100 aiming to achieve business operations with the 100 usage of electric of renewable energy origin  the government will thereby increase the number of companies that incorporate decarbonization into corporate management and facilitate wide acceptance in the society  focusing on the social value of cars as part of the energy infrastructure and in order to promote the use of the power storage and power supply functions of the electrified vehicle the council for electrified vehicle society is established to facilitate collaboration among energy companies user companies and local authorities together with the automobiles manufacturers  the government will also create an environment in which human resources and suppliers are trained based on collaboration between companies and between the industry and academia  the government will also take initiatives to reduce co emissions by 2encouraging cooperation between shippers and logistics companies carrying out deliveries to improve efficiencies in transportation and loading  to accelerate the use of environmentally friendly eco-drive vehicles such as trucks and buses for business the government aims for wider use of support systems - 47 - that uses the ict technology amongst transportation companies  it is envisaged that capable communities and companies achieve carbon neutrality even before 2050  additionally the government aims to reduce co emissions in logistics and distribution by 2reducing redelivery with cooperation among shippers and logistics and deliver companies diversification and improved convenience in delivery methods for courier services and improving the environment for active participation of consumers  the government will also promote the use of environmental information for decarbonization by companies and individuals such as the diffusion of methods for understanding ghg emissions throughout the entire supply chain which includes local small and medium-sized enterprises for the environment-conscious products and business activities to be highly valued by society and the market  in this regard the government aims to smoothly expand the energy resource aggregation business in which the aggregator the information management and operation entity using the demand response dr and virtual power plant vpp facilitates the customers in controling and creating their demands of energy at the request of the retail electric power companies and power transmission and distribution companies who will pay fees for the adjusted demands  the government will promote the introduction of local energy companies and the development of the energy system suited to local production for local consumption in order to make the best use of the abundant renewable energy sources rural areas offer which in turn will lead to the vitality and sustainable development of the areas  in the business community numerous companies have announced their aim to use 100 renewable energy in their electric consumption by 2050  in conjunction with this companies have increasingly set out individual long-term vision some of which envisage carbon neutrality by 2050 5 c target the government will support ambitious communities and companies to work towards carbon neutrality and achieve it even before 2050 where possible  as corporate activities greatly contribute to local decarbonization the government will facilitate ambitious goal setting reduction initiatives and awareness campaign by companies including small and medium-sized local companies  these measures will also help japanese companies competing globally amidst the strong current of decarbonization  to accelerate such efforts and give support the recovery of fukushima from the energysect the government prefecture and related companies work together to move forward with the - 61 - initiatives including the fukushima renewable energy institute aist frea established in 2014  the government will also provide human resource development for local companies related to renewable energy  there are successful cases of long-term investment - 68 - on research and development coming into fruition for example in photovoltaics japanese companies provided much of the global production of solar cells for a certain period of time making significant contribution to the worlds effort in tackling global warming  stronger initiatives leading to business young researchers and start-up companies who are the key to the introduction of technologies to the society will be in the front lines of research and technology development in the future as the climate change further progresses and therefore are extremely important players in research and development  furthermore in order to facilitate the research and technology development as well as capital investment by companies in the energy and environmental fields such activities will be visualized to the market and incentives will be designed to expand privatesect investment  for companies selected by public organizations  the research and development as well as business development of the start-ups and small and medium-sized companies will be supported in such ways  a efficient use of heat various efforts have been made in the effective use of waste heat generated in the industrial production process with ingenious ideas developed by japanese companies  corporate governance reform is also being promoted through constructive dialogue between institutional investors and companies in order to achieve sustainable growth and increase corporate value in the longer term  specifically the corporate governance code clearly states that the listed companies should take appropriate measures to address sustainability issues  the stewardship code provides the example of risks and opportunities arising from social and - 91 - environmental matters in a guidance for institutional investors to monitor investee companies  for the disclosure of climate-related financial information the government also formulated the worlds first guidance for climate-related financial disclosures tcfd guidance in december 2018 in order to facilitate the dialogues between business operators and investors at a managerial level and to effectively disclose the initiatives and strong points of the companies in each sector  this tcfd guidance may also be viewed as a specific attempt under the guidance for integrated corporate disclosure and company-investor dialogue for collaborative value creation the ministry of economy trade and industry meti may 2017 which sets a common narrative between the companies and investors it thus encourages the formation of corporate value creation stories in terms of action on climate change  at the same time the government encourages the endorsement of the tcfd by companies as a means to promote esg investment with active corporate initiatives  furthermore the government formulated the practical guide for scenario analysis in line with tcfd recommendations the ministry of the environment march 2019 to support companies analyze their own climate-related risks and opportunities within the tcfd framework and practically reflect the results in their business strategies  in order to facilitate the dialogue between investors and companies a database to enable the comparison of information disclosed by each company will be required  the international environmental initiatives working on the disclosure and assessment of information on climate change measures by global companies such as the cdp re100 and sbt are becoming more influential and the japanese companies need to respond to such initiatives  the government has therefore provided technical support to the companies who are engaged in these international environment initiatives and aim at ambitious - 92 - efforts and also formulated the guidance for encouraging japanese companies to address international initiatives on climate change  directions of policy measures 1 basic directions of policy measures initiatives and innovations by companies to contribute to climate change measures need to be appropriately visualized in order to realize a virtuous cycle of environment and growth  the government will urge companies and financial institutions to take positive stances and improving the environment for mainstreaming esg finance  accordingly the government encourages the companies to support the tcfd  promoting effective information disclosure by companies expanding on the tcfd guidance / scenario analysis guide to help japanese companies more effectively disclose their information the government needs to facilitate the understanding of the tcfd and clarify key points for various types of industries and sizes of companies  accordingly the government is promoting the tcfd guidance for example by broadening the range of industries covered and facilitating the use of the guidance by small and medium-sized companies  as for the scenario analysis to conform with the tcfd the government will further expand the practical guide for scenario analysis in line with tcfd recommendations with more best practices to facilitate companies appropriately analyze and assess the opportunities and risks and formulate a resilient business strategy appealing to the investors as a result  dialogue between the industries and the financial sector tcfd consortium the tcfd consortium is formed which will serve as a venue for the tcfd supporters among japanese companies and financial institutions who will make the worlds largest community of tcfd supporters  through proactive dialogues among companies and financial institutions various issues pertaining to the disclosure of climate change-related information and the future direction for attracting investment and achieving a virtuous cycle of environment and growth - 94 - will be discussed  in order to share such knowledge and best practices the tcfd summit will be held in fall 2019 as an international gathering of leading companies investors and organizations involved with the tcfd  the government will provide assistance to the participation of japanese companies and their target-setting disclosure and argument in the international climate change initiatives such as the cdp and re100 so that the japanese companies aware of trends in climate change such as the use of renewable energy and actively engaged in such efforts will receive proper appraisal and promote climate change actions and expansion of renewable energy investment  development of a dialogue platform on environmental information and corporate value assessment in order to achieve a virtuous cycle of environment and growth it is important to expand esg finance by encouraging effective dialogue among companies investors and other parties  companies are expected to actively participate in such discussions and initiatives to form strategic business models enabling efforts to address climate change and raise the corporate value at the same time and to send out such messages and engaged in dialogue with investors in

design incentives to expand privatesect investment  2 developing initiatives by diverse actors including the privatesect the activities of various actors such as local authorities companies financial institutions and research institutions to achieve the long-term goals stipulated in the paris agreement have intensified worldwide  efforts have been made in the world for companies to estimate ghg emissions in the entire supply-chain and reduce them  such efforts will not only concern the countries where the companies are registered but also other countries where - 98 - affiliated companies or factories are located  for example as in the expanded partnership for quality infrastructure announced in 2016 the government set a target to supply approximately 200 billion dollars of financial resources for five years to support the japanese companies engagement in the vast demands for infrastructure and enhance the 32 for example systems pertaining to the inventory of and estimating reporting and publishing of ghg  it has been widely recognized that the initiatives by private companies and the use of private funds greatly contribute to building a decarbonized society not least at the climate change summit  relevant ministries will collaborate with private companies to support cooperation on international application improve business environment through public and privatesect initiatives in asean and promote a virtuous cycle of environment and growth in each country  to enable international application of local companies the government will facilitate the accumulation of expertise and the sophistication of technology in that specific region  the oof will be primarily used for japanese companies seeking opportunities abroad and oda such as privatesect investment finance will be used for international cooperation to support developing countries the synergy between the two modalities to mobilize private finance and create impact will be sought  furthermore in order to support the japanese companies with technologies of excellence useful for decarbonization in the world in both developing and developed countries the government will support providing public finance on projects using advanced technologies and new ventures thereby promoting innovation and investment by japanese companies  the government will actively engage in the effective and efficient operation of the gcf and the green environment facility gef for improved access of funds - 105 - for developing countries as well as for fostering understanding on financing mechanism and project cycles and networking with accredited agencies with a view to the participation of the japanese and partner companies leading to co-innovation  the government will support collaboration between the local authorities private companies and financial institutions of japan and the partner country to facilitate the use of private finance in the partner country including by setting venues for dialogue and together with such institutions as the world bank and the asian development bank  these measures will reduce the risk for private investment provide incentives to private companies and enhance the flow of private funds thereby activating the market for decarbonizing technologies  in business management the government will facilitate companies incorporate perspectives to appropriately address environmental issues and create new - 108 - corporate values  in this context the government will facilitate efforts of companies to develop human resources in and out of the company to be engaged in management emphasizing environment and environmental protection and lead a green socio-economic system -- environmental human resources  since many companies in japan are rooted in localities a comprehensive consideration on transitioning local economies and companies will be required as well  against this backdrop the government local authorities and companies will work together to provide vocational training to the workforce support for diversification and shifts in business operations inviting new business and support for placement of the labor force in order to achieve the transition of the workforce to a decarbonized society smoothly and without delay  decarbonization starting with capable communities and businesses  regional initiatives to this end to also contribute to

with capacity building and public awareness campaigns to disseminate and share the knowledge of climate change and specific actions to solve the problem  in addition the government will also enhance the capacity and the use of interregional interconnections and other transmission lines  over the longer term in order to realize decarbonization of gas itself the possibility of decarbonization with moderate social costs will be sought using existing lng / city gas infrastructure and consumer-side equipment  the government aims to use co that is emitted from chemical plants and 2waste incinerators as a raw material to produce methanol and methane with water and hydrogen and then use those in chemical raw materials city gas and so on  furthermore the government will also promote maximum efficiency of internal combustion engines the key to streamlining corporate average fuel efficiency and the development and early utilization of biofuels and alternative fuels that can be commercialized and have the capacity for significant co reduction  if a heat source and heat demand are appropriately concentrated in a city of a compact size the availability of unused renewable heat will be increased  hydrogen for example can be used in so many ways not only as an alternative to fuels for automobiles which depend heavily on fossil fuels but also for a substitute power source for coal and lng-fired thermal power generation a reducing agent in steel manufacturing in place of coke and by reacting with co2as an alternative to crude oil and naphtha used in the petrochemical industry and natural gas used in the city gas the leading cause of global warming  energy storage technologies can serve as the power source for electrified vehicles and increase the capacity factor of water electrolysis devices for hydrogen production connected to fluctuating renewable energy playing a major role in a shift from the fossil fuel-dependent society to the eletrified society  however the fluctuating nature of renewable energies such as solar and wind power has resulted in a relatively low ratio of capacity utilization and the cost of electric from renewable energy power sources is not yet sufficiently low enough  in addition in order to achieve a decarbonized society adjustment on the demand-side capacity is also important not only on the supply and the grid  in pursuit of the potentials of demand-side - 85 - capacity adjustment close scrutiny into the industries the manufacturing processes and potentials to respond to the demand creation and lowering the cost for controllable distributed energy resources such as fixed storage batteries are important alongside the management of hydrogen and heat as a means to store and utilize electric  target

particular in order to make the maximum use of privatesect abilities and attract finance and investment it is imperative for the government to provide a consistent climate change policy towards an ambitious vision and preparing environment for investment  in this context it is necessary that privatesect investment focus on corporations which address climate change issues and/or take on innovations  on the instruction of the g20 finance ministers and central bank governors the financial stability board in december 2015 set up the privatesect-led task force on climate-related financial disclosures tcfd  with these initiatives in the public and privatesects japanese green bonds market has grown the issuance of green bonds has risen by approximately seven times over two years from 2016 to 2018 and both issuers and the uses of proceeds have diversified  furthermore the government is working to disseminate the efforts of the japanese public and privatesects such as holding tcfd symposiums in and outside japan and raise the awareness on the tcfd  initiatives to expand esg finance for direct finance the government will promote the issuance of green bonds and support the expansion of the domestic green bond market with the efforts of both public and privatesects  for companies selected by public organizations for their excellence making such companies visible to the market and design incentives to expand privatesect investment  2 developing initiatives by diverse actors including the privatesect the activities of various actors such as local authorities companies financial institutions and research institutions to achieve the long-term goals stipulated in the paris agreement have intensified worldwide  to this end it is important to send out a message that enhanced transparency will be accompanied by incentives the promotion of projects and investment of the privatesect  official development assistance oda plays a role as a catalyst for mobilizing privatesect esg finance aimed at addressing climate change and environment in addition to the conventional modalities  relevant ministries will collaborate with private companies to support cooperation on international application improve business environment through public and privatesect initiatives in asean and promote a virtuous cycle of environment and growth in each country  the oof will be primarily used for japanese companies seeking opportunities abroad and oda such as privatesect investment finance will be used for international cooperation to support developing countries the synergy between the two modalities to mobilize private finance and create impact will be sought  the responses to these disasters have placed a considerable economic burden to the central and local governments  in addition in order to realize a virtuous cycle of environment and growth japan will prepare an environment that promotes and utilizes innovation for decarbonization at all levels including companies investors financial institutions consumers and local governments and brings about changes in lifestyle  the responses to these disasters have placed a considerable

alliances among r&d institutes with facilitation of international joint r&d activities- 3 - research and development 20 for clean energy technologiesrd20 stronger initiatives leading to business providing knowledge-based support e  in particular it is expected that a country like japan trusted worldwide for the quality of industrial products and the high standard of science and technology should contribute globally through the implementation of its long-term strategy  for example recently there has been an increasing number of companies that set sbts science based targets focusing on reduction targets across the entire supply chains in line with the goals of the paris agreement and those participated in re 100 aiming to achieve business operations with the 100 usage of electric of renewable energy origin  for these lifestyle shifts the government will carry out a nationwide campaign to encourage cool choice such as the use of goods and services that contribute to decarbonization while putting together the scientific knowledge citizen science through public involvement  furthermore through behavioral science knowledge including nudge and its integration with advanced technologies such as the ai and iot the government will encourage decarbonizing behavior that can be practiced voluntarily and in an enjoyable way  the national energy and environment strategy for technological innovation towards 2050 was subsequently - 67 - formulated and decided by the council for science technology and innovation under the cabinet office on 19th april 2016  the ministry of education culture sports science and technology mext has also started jst-mirai program specifying technological issues by back-casting from the goal of a large-scale reduction of co in 2050 2and facilitating high-risk but high-impact research and development utilizing academic ideas  furthermore as a new initiative the government will also invite leading figures in science and technology from major countries g20 to the international conference held in japan drawing together diverse types of knowledge to create disruptive innovation for large-scale reductions of co  human resource development for innovation in order to create sustained innovations for the virtuous cycle of environment and growth it is important that the government develops and maintain human resources in a wide range of fields starting with science and technology that relate to environment and energy  in addition to this the population especially the youth continues to move from rural areas to cities and accelerates a geographical imbalance in the population  d circulating and ecological economy for japan where the population declines and the society ages with fewer children it is important to set a growth strategy to strengthen the vitality of local communities  in the longer term it is certain that global demand for addressing climate change will grow japan will carry out policies to uphold and ensure the emergence of changes in the business sector while involving citizens at all levels realize a virtuous cycle of environment and growth through business-led disruptive innovation and contribute to the solution of the climate change problem  at the same time the government will facilitate the shift in minds of japanese citizens at all levels to lead them to take action with capacity building and public awareness campaigns to disseminate and share the knowledge of climate change and specific actions to solve the problem  for these lifestyle shifts the government will carry out a nationwide campaign to encourage cool choice such as the use of goods and services that contribute to decarbonization while putting together the scientific knowledge citizen science through public involvement  lifestyle innovation lifestyle innovation shifting the way of life of each citizen towards sustainability provides a major impact directly and indirectly on climate change through consumer behaviors and the use of fuels energy and resources  d circulating and ecological economy for japan where the population declines and the society ages with fewer children it is important to set a growth strategy to strengthen the vitality of local communities  furthermore the government will support each stakeholder including companies and local communities in sharing awareness for a decarbonized society forming a future vision of the society and taking proactive action  specifically the government will collaborate with local communities to immediately begin strengthening the human resources technologies and industrial foundations that will enable the resolution of fundamental issues such as drastic enhancement of power generation efficiency to overcome spatial constraint development of high-performance low-cost storage batteries and hydrogen systems aimed at decarbonization of flexibility sources sophistication of power electronics technology and development of digital technology to conduct supply/demand adjustment more precisely reinforcement of transmission networks taking into account the distribution of renewable energy and the development of distributed network systems  local communities endowed with diverse resources alongside economic and social challenges are actually suited to become a model of a decarbonized society a bright society with a hope for the future  for the introduction of renewable energy symbiotic to the locality and its ecosystem the government will prepare a ground for community-based initiative including the local authority enterprise and residents and consensus building with local communities  at places outside schools such as families local communities and workplaces voluntary efforts will be encouraged and best practices actively shared including by introducing awards  in addition green infrastructure and ecosystem-based approaches including the one based on forest eba and eco-drr will have various advantageous effects such as adaptation to climate change such as disaster risk reduction mitigation of climate change in terms of carbon sink generation of various social economic and cultural co-benefits in local communities and contribution to conservation of biodiversity and its sustainable use  on the instruction of the g20 finance ministers and central bank governors the

place and greater capacity to adapt to climate change and variability  considering the above and knowing the complexity involved in planning and make progress on adaptation increase adaptation capacity and resilience to climate change and reduce the risks involved it is justified by the fact that uruguay has an open economy planning in the field of climate action heavily based on agro-industrial production food exports 79 of the total pna-agro tourism that in recent years has reached great dynamism  article 2 is also concentrated in the cities increase the capacity to adapt to

gva with an elasticity constant calculated with historical data from the ben and the gdp  demand for production capacity  this subsector is modeled considering that existing plants as the next to be

corresponding calculated elasticity  only formal income is considered phased construction of the third pulp mill operating at 100 of its capacity by 2025  a transpsect is modeled trend scenario in which both the capacity of the refinery and its for transport subsectors - fluvial utilization remain constant and equal to the values of 2018 88 measured so that their demand for fuel remains constant and equal of the maximum capacity  whats more of the internal demand for fuels assuming that production will be imported until supply is complete and considering that it will operate at full capacity in 2035  annual sales data is used by by 2040 new cargo vehicles with lower capacity8 are autodata fuel to determine your current trends zero emissions  in this studio in both scenarios the increase in the installed capacity of electric is considered to be distributed in the same way as the aggregate demand  of the demand for raw material from pulp processing plants for pulp operating at

as an input for production  in the last four years once the third paper mill is operating at full capacity that has reached maturity and whose cut cannot be deferred  current installed capacity of clinker production is approximately 1200 kton de clinker emissions from cement production are estimated using a level 2 according to equation 2  increasing your capacity often requires investment high furnace should be replaced so emissions depend on the amount of clinker produced of cao in the clinker and the ckd correction factor the fraction of kiln dust that is not recycled  cover production
