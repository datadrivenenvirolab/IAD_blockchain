<h2 id="preamble">PREAMBLE</h2>
<p>We are pleased to present the Nationally Identified Planned Contribution at the National Level (CPDN) of the Republic of Haiti, which provides relevant information on the proposed effort to address climate hazards. This document sets the orientations on which the actions of the Haitian State will be based during the next fifteen years in order to adapt to climate change and to reduce its emissions of greenhouse gases by 31% compared to a scenario By 2030. With this effort, Haiti remains one of the world's least emitting GHG countries.</p>
<p>The development of the CPDN is the result of a strong consensus among government, civil society and the private sector on the objectives to be achieved. Many speakers have contributed to the elaboration of this document, which responds adequately to the needs and interests of the Haitian people and is in line with the Strategic Plan for the Development of Haiti (PSDH), the National Action Plan of Adaptation (PANA) and the Second National Communication on Climate Change.</p>
<p>There are many challenges for the Haitian government and people. Haiti must take the necessary measures to both propel its development, adapt to climate change and contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. To do this, we believe it is important to link the fight against global warming to the goal of emerging countries by 2030 set in the PSDH. Thus, our CPDN is articulated around some issues that seem to us priority:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integrated water and watershed management;</li>
<li>Integrated coastal zone management and infrastructure rehabilitation;</li>
<li>The preservation and strengthening of food security, in particular through the development of the bioeconomy;</li>
<li>Energy transition to reduce dependence on fossil fuels; Information, education and awareness.</li>
<li>Information, education and awareness.</li>
</ul>
<p>The commitments made in the CPDN represent a global financing requirement of USD 25,387 billion. Haiti therefore expects a real conjunction of the efforts of the international community to continue to support the fight against climate change under the principle of "common but differentiated responsibilities" enshrined in the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development.</p>

<h3 id="equity-and-ambition">1.3 EQUITY AND AMBITION</h3>
<p>In 2000, GHG emissions in Haiti accounted for only 0.03% of total global emissions. The per capita emissions calculated for the same year were 0.91 TCO<sub>2</sub>eq. Despite its status as the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) of the American hemisphere and the Small Island Developing State, which is heavily affected by climate-related disasters, the Republic of Haiti firmly believes in the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, A global effort to reduce emissions to achieve the objectives of limiting global warming below 2&deg;C. At the end of this contribution, the country wants to reduce its emissions by 31% compared to the reference scenario. However, given the limited capacity of the country, the achievement of this ambitious objective in relation to its mitigation potential requires the financial, technical and technological support of the international community.</p>
<h2 id="adaptation-contribution">5. ADAPTATION CONTRIBUTION</h2>
<p>Haiti, located in the Caribbean Basin, is exposed to many climate-related phenomena. Variations in the rainfall pattern, ed temperature, frequency of tropical storms are among many other climatic signals observed across the country.</p>
<p>The scenarios established in Haiti show an increase in temperature (from 0.80C to 1C) by 203, a decrease in annual rainfall from 6 to 20 per cent, a shift in rainfall seasonality and an increase in the average level Of the sea. By 2014, Haiti has been ranked fourth in the world in terms of vulnerability to the effects of climate change<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, the country has often been the victim of climate disruptions, mainly due to changes in watershed water systems, increased periods of drought and loss of life due to flooding Tropical storms. The cumulative costs of climate change impacts without taking preventive measures are estimated at US $ 1.8 billion and US $ 77 million through adaptation measures by 2025<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Given the different observed and anticipated impacts, measures have been taken to increase the country's resilience to the impacts of extreme climate-related phenomena. In 2006, Haiti developed its National Adaptation Plan of Action (NAPA) and implemented</p>
<p>A set of activities deriving from NAPA and its Pilot Program on Climate Resilience (PPRC). Similarly, land-use planning efforts are underway to reduce the vulnerability of the country. However, the measures do not have the scale and intensity needed to respond to the needs arising from the changes under way, particularly in terms of demography and ecosystems.</p>
<p>The various priority actions identified in the National Adaptation Action Plan (NAPA) are not all implemented due to a lack of funding and the weak capacity of public institutions. Difficult access to appropriate financing and technological resources, lack of a regulatory and legislative framework for adaptation to climate change are obstacles to the implementation of planned activities. In this sense, the country needs strengthened technical and institutional capacity and technological and financial support to overcome these barriers</p>
<p><strong>5.2.- PRIORITIES AND ADAPTATION OBJECTIVES</strong></p>
<p>The country's priorities for adaptation to climate change are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integrated water and watershed management;</li>
<li>Integrated coastal zone management and infrastructure rehabilitation;</li>
<li>Preserving and strengthening security;</li>
<li>Information, education and awareness.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under this contribution, Haiti commits itself by 2030 to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integrate the effects of climate change into sectoral development strategies;</li>
<li>Develop the 15 strategic watersheds most vulnerable to extreme climate events according to land use patterns;</li>
<li>Protect coastal areas from the impacts of climate change;</li>
<li>Developing bio-economics, climate-friendly and biological agriculture.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="planning-process">6. PLANNING PROCESS</h2>
<p>For the implementation of its CPDN,the country intends to define during the period 2016-2020:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its National Policy on Climate Change;</li>
<li>Its National Adaptation Plan (NAP);</li>
<li>Its Climate Loss and Response Plan;</li>
<li>Its Regional Development Plans by region;</li>
<li>And its National Forest Policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also for this period, the country aims to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Revise its institutional and legal framework in relation to the objectives of the contribution;</li>
<li>Implement MRV and Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Measures (NAMAs).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="institutional-framework-and-means-of-implementation">7. INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK AND MEANS OF IMPLEMENTATION</h2>
<p>The existing institutional framework for the implementation of actions in the field of climate change is essentially based on the Ministry of the Environment through its climate change management. For the implementation of the CPDN, ​​the head of the Haitian government will assert his leadership on the file and coordination will be ensured by the Ministry of the Environment in direct and continuous collaboration with the National Committee on Climate Change put in place. This committee will be made up of representatives of sectoral ministries, local authorities, civil society and the private sector and will have the mandate to steer, monitor and report on the activities of the Haitian commitment. Gender will be taken into account throughout the CPDN implementation process.</p>
<p>The overall financial envelope for the implementation of the actions foreseen in this contribution is estimated at 25.387 billion USD, of which 16.614 billion USD for the adaptation actions and 8.773 billion USD for the mitigation actions. Conditional and unconditional mitigation measures amount to US $ 7,999 billion and USD 773,519 million, respectively. This will require:</p>
<ul>
<li>Direct access to the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and other funds for conditional mitigation and adaptation activities (Annex 8.2), including the development and implementation of the National Adaptation Plan</li>
<li>Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD +) and the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM);</li>
<li>Institutional capacity building;</li>
<li>Technology transfers based on Technology Needs Assessments (TNAs).</li>
</ul>
<p>The Republic of Haiti calls for the establishment of an emergency fund for Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and LDCs to enable them to take post-emergency measures following disasters linked to climate change. It also calls for an international emission-reduction mechanism, such as the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), to be set up under the new climate regimepost 2020, guided by principles of environmental integrity, transparency And absence of double counting. Haiti is in favor of the rapid establishment of such a market in order to mobilize the potential even before 2020</p>
