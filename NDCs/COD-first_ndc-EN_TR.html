<h2 id="aim-development-priorities-and-national-context-of-climate-change"><strong>1.</strong> Aim, development priorities and national context of climate change</h2>
<h3 id="goal-and-sustainable-development-plans">1.1 Goal and Sustainable Development Plans</h3>
<p>The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is characterized by (i) its wealth of exceptional natural resources (forests, mines, water resources, biodiversity, energy), (ii) its dense hydrographic network , The Congo River Basin is the most dominant (3.7 million km²), and (iii) has an estimated population of about 75 million, with a population growth rate of 3.1% Of the informal sector.</p>
<p>The National Sustainable Development Strategy and the Government Action Program for 2012-2016 and the 2030 Emergency Outlook focus on priority areas including mining, agriculture, forestry and the development of the industrial fabric in A more decentralized framework</p>
<p>The integration of environmental concerns, in general, with sustainable development and climate change in particular, into all sector strategies and national development planning remains a key issue.</p>
<h3 id="main-challenges-of-socio-economic-and-environmental-development.">1.2. Main challenges of socio-economic and environmental development.</h3>
<p>On the economic front, the country is making gains in average GDP growth of 5.6% over the period 2006-2010 and 8.1% between 2011 and 2013. National private sector investment has increased little (Less than 5% of GDP between 1990 and 2010). Over the past 10 years, public spending has focused on developing the infrastructure needed for economic development. In addition, the agricultural sector, which accounts for almost 70 per cent of the country's labor force, contributes 50 per cent to the national economy (UNDP, 2010).</p>
<p>Despite the progress made, however:</p>
<ul>
<li>The DRC is in a precarious social situation, which does not appear to have improved significantly over the last twenty years according to figures from the report on the MDGs<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. It is marked by population poverty, contrasting with the immensity of the country's natural potential, which is accentuated by a strong demographic growth weighing on the demand for social services in both rural and urban areas, with unequal distribution between the provinces;</li>
<li>The country remains the country with the lowest human development index in the 187 countries, according to the 2014 Human Development Report. The proportion of the population below the minimum level of caloric intake has increased over the years 90, from 31% to 73%. Thus, food insecurity remains high and currently affects 76% of the Congolese population<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, whereas food accounts for 62.3% of the total expenditure of Congolese households<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></li>
<li>The rate of access of the population to electricity remains very low: 15% nationally (1% in rural areas, 30% in cities), while the average in sub-Saharan Africa is 24.6%;</li>
<li>The rate of access to drinking water is 47%, the rate of access to the sanitation service is 14% (MICS, 2010); Public access to the waste management service remains insignificant in the urban environment and virtually absent in rural areas;</li>
<li>Unemployment, especially among young people (15-24 years), fueled by strong population growth, remains at a very high level, 18% at the national level, and particularly affects urban youth (32%).</li>
</ul>
<p>The lack of both internal and external funding for the effective implementation of large-scale strategies and action plans in various areas as well as major legal and institutional reforms is a major challenge. The absence of a genuine policy of inter-sectoral interventions in a context of combating conflicts of competence between different sectors (mining, agriculture, forestry) does not facilitate the implementation of climate change actions within a framework Federating programs for both mitigation and adaptation.</p>
<p>In recent years, the DRC has been developing its vision of development towards emergence by 2060, within the framework of the materialization of the Revolution of Modernity, the planning of which is sequenced in three phases, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Between 2012 and 2020, the DRC will have to move from a low-income to a middle-income country through the transformation of agriculture;</li>
<li>Between 2020 and 2030, the DRC will become an emerging country through intensive industrialization through the development of the energy sector in support of the mining and agricultural industries;</li>
<li>Between 2030 and 2060, the DRC will have to move from emerging to developed countries, notably through a green economy and a knowledge society.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, it should be noted that the DRC is a low-carbon country to date, with distinctive features that distinguish it from other territories: the natural capital of its forest, its hydroelectric potential and its interconnection capacity with the countries of the sub-region, it’s very important growth potential. Given the envisaged national development vision, the country should orient its development towards a long-term, sustainable and environmentally friendly development perspective.</p>
<h3 id="national-climate-change-context">1.3. National Climate Change Context</h3>
<p>The DRC ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 and 2005. Since then, it has carried out a series of activities in the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Inventory of its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in 2001, 2009 and 2014;</li>
<li>the adoption of Law N ° 011/2002 of 29 August 2002 on the Forest Code;</li>
<li>the preparation of the National Environment, Forests, Waters and Biodiversity Program;</li>
<li>assessment of risks and vulnerability to the impacts of climate change in 2006 and implementation of adaptation projects, particularly in the agricultural sector since 2010;</li>
<li>identification of mitigation potential and technological needs in 2007;</li>
<li>Implementing processes to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD, 2009):</p>
<p>(i) Commitment to the Forest Sector Investment Program (2010);</p>
<p>(ii) The adoption of the National Framework Strategy on REDD + (2012);</p>
<p>(iii) The creation of the National REDD + Fund in 2012;</p></li>
<li>launching the process of formulating the national climate change policy, strategy and action plan that includes three pillars, namely:</p>
<p>(i)The low carbon development strategy (2012);</p>
<p>(ii) The DRC's National Adaptation Plan for Climate Change (2014);</p>
<p>(iii) cross-sectoral integration into sectoral policies and strategies;</li>
<li>The development of the electricity sector policy document, including the Atlas of Renewable Energies in the DRC.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="national-ghg-inventory-management-system.">1.4. National GHG Inventory Management System.</h3>
<p>The Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable Development (MEDD), through the Sustainable Development Department (DDD), a governmental body responsible for international negotiations, responsible for coordinating and monitoring the harmonious and coherent implementation of the Government on climate change, manages GHG inventories.</p>
<p>A national climate change committee, under the supervision of the Secretary General for Environment and Sustainable Development, in an intersectoral and interdisciplinary approach, provides the main guidelines for the implementation of climate change programs and projects.</p>
<p>Under the supervision of the DDD, teams of experts from government ministries and departments, national universities and research centers, private institutions and non-governmental organizations are responsible for defining methodological approaches and implementation Work to estimate GHG emissions and assess vulnerability to the effects of climate change, as well as technological needs. The responsibility for the formal approval of the inventory reports of emissions is specifically the responsibility of the National Climate Committee, which submits it to the Government.</p>
<p>A national monitoring, monitoring, verification and reporting system related to REDD + activities has been developed within MEDD. Operational technical units work on three pillars of this system. These include (i) Satellite Land Surveillance System (SSTS), (ii) National Forest Inventory (NFI), and (iii) Greenhouse Gas Inventory (IGES). To date, each of these three pillars is making considerable progress in terms of outputs and technical and human capacity building. A similar system for monitoring emissions outside forests is being formulated as part of the process of developing the low carbon development strategy and formulating NAMAs</p>
<h2 id="contribution-to-adaptation">2. Contribution to adaptation</h2>
<h3 id="justification-for-taking-into-account-adaptation-in-the-development-process-of-the-cpdn.">2.1. Justification for taking into account adaptation in the development process of the CPDN.</h3>
<p>The greenhouse gas inventory carried out in the DRC (MEDD, 2015) shows the main emitters. These are mainly land use, land-use change and forestry, followed by agriculture and energy. For the rest, emissions are negligible.</p>
<p>The National Adaptation Program for Climate Change, NAPA (MECNT, 2006) has established a limited mapping of DRC vulnerability to the impacts of climate change. It has, however, revealed enormous concerns about agriculture, water resources and coastal areas, which are highly vulnerable in the areas of food security and health.</p>
<h3 id="summary-of-trends-impacts-and-vulnerabilities-to-climate-change.">2.2. Summary of Trends, Impacts and Vulnerabilities to Climate Change.</h3>
<p>The following observations emerged from the analyzes carried out:</p>
<p>(A) projections of temperature changes by 2050 are of the order of 1 to 2 ° C and 1.5 to 3 ° C by 2100 under the low-emission scenario B1 (Van Garderen, and Ludwig, 2013);</p>
<p>(B) the results obtained in the Pitman simulation at the Bukama station for the period 2046-2065 show an increase in current and potential evapotranspiration of 10-15%;</p>
<p>(C) on the basis of analyzes of the climatic history of the Kinshasa N'Djili site,</p>
<ul>
<li>it appears that the frequency of extreme wet and dry extreme events becomes greater at 2081-2100;</li>
<li>significant disturbance to the seasonal distribution of rainfall by 2046-2065;</li>
</ul>
<p>(D) under the Pitman hydrological model for Bukama station, it appears that:</p>
<ul>
<li>a slight increase in the soil moisture stock of 3.1%, which would be the result of a precipitation increase of 10.6%;</li>
<li>a slight decrease in total runoff due to a decrease in surface runoff and runoff.</li>
</ul>
<p>(E) Analysis of the simulation results of Schellnhuber et al. (2013), stipulate an increase in sea level of about 10% from the current level along the coastlines of the African continent. For the DRC, this increase will be of the order of 60-70 cm for the scenarios of 2 ° C of temperature rise (RCP 2.6).</p>
<p>The five major climate risks (intense rains, coastal erosion, floods, heat seizures, and seasonal droughts) with high impact that threaten the daily lives of populations, including loss of life, destruction of infrastructure, erosion, destruction Especially the urban poor, and increase vulnerability due to water-borne diseases. Seasonal droughts cause serious disturbances in agricultural calendars.</p>
<h3 id="notification-of-vision-goals-and-targets-for-short--and-long-term-adaptation.">2.3. Notification of vision, goals and targets for short- and long-term adaptation.</h3>
<p>The DRC's vision for the implementation of adaptation is rooted in the National Adaptation Program for Adaptation to Climate Change (NAPA, 2006). The program identified three priority areas for adaptation interventions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>Securing the livelihoods and lifestyles of rural / urban communities;</li>
<li>Rational management of forest resources, and</li>
<li>Protection and preservation of vulnerable ecosystems in coastal areas.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since 2014, a process of updating the NAPA guidelines and integrating the issue of adaptation into sectoral policies and strategies, participatory and multidisciplinary, was initiated within the framework of the National Plan of Adaptation to the climatic changes (PNA).</p>
<h3 id="notification-of-current-and-planned-adaptation-initiatives-and-support.">2.4. Notification of current and planned adaptation initiatives and support.</h3>
<p>The country has already made efforts to develop urgent adaptation actions in the areas of agriculture, community rehabilitation and the fight against coastal erosion. It is:</p>
<ul>
<li>PANA-ASA (2010-2013): Adaptation project of the agricultural sector which focused on improving the resilience of this sector, at the level of 4 pilot provinces;</li>
<li>PANA-ASA 2 Project for Resilient Economic Growth and Adaptation to Climate Change in the DRC, to be implemented from 2016 onwards, involves the dissemination of NAPA-ASA assets into new target areas. This project will aim to create an enabling environment for adaptation and improve agro-ecological production practices;</li>
<li>PANA-AFE (2015-2020): This ongoing project capitalizes the achievements of PANA-ASA by strengthening the resilience of women and children to climate change in the former NAPA-ASA intervention areas. It targets the DRC's commitment to protecting the most vulnerable groups from climate risks;</li>
<li>NAPA Coastal Zone (2015-2020): This ongoing project aims to strengthen the resilience of communities to climate change through the implementation of coastal erosion control, early warning and diversification of income-generating activities for vulnerable communities.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="gaps-and-barriers">2.5. Gaps and barriers</h3>
<p>The DRC faces various socio-economic development challenges, coupled with its vulnerability to the impacts of climate change. In addition, it faces major challenges across its territory for the development of a coherent adaptation program. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inadequate reliable climate data for a realistic analysis and interpretation of climate change;</li>
<li>Weak technical, institutional and legal capacity to support the development of horizontal integration of the adaptation dimension at the national, regional and local levels;</li>
<li>The financial inadequacy to accompany the implementation of adaptation initiatives.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="summary-of-needs">2.6. Summary of needs</h3>
<p>The needs relate mainly to the agriculture sector, the energy and transport sector with access to reinforcement of drinking water supply, sanitation and waste management, reinforcement of conservation measures, biodiversity and population integration in the forestry sector and integrated coastal zone protection. Total investment requirements amount to USD 9.082 billion, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Agriculture sector: USD 1,563.90 million</li>
<li>Energy and Transport Sector: USD 7,350.00 million</li>
<li>Forestry sector: USD 50.00 million</li>
<li>Coastal zone and coastal zone (vulnerable zone Banana-Nsianfumu 26 km): 118,000 million USD</li>
</ul>

<p>Figure 1 : Breakdown of adaptation cost by sector (in billion USD).</p>
<h3 id="monitoring-and-reporting-mechanism">2.7. Monitoring and reporting mechanism</h3>
<p>The country recognizes that monitoring and evaluation of adaptation policies and programs is crucial in order to ensure that resources are targeted on the measures that will provide the best chance of increasing the resilience of its population. The development of key adaptation indicators has already been explored within the framework of the NAPA-ASA project and will be continued during the implementation of the NAP-AFE and PANA-Coastal Zone projects. The main lessons learned will be shared with all programs. The objective is to integrate adaptation and vulnerability indicators into the national monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) system to be developed</p>
<h2 id="contribution-related-to-mitigation.">3. Contribution related to mitigation.</h2>
<h3 id="calendar">3.1. Calendar: </h3>
<p>2021 to 2030.</p>
<h3 id="contribution-type">3.2. Contribution type</h3>
<p>The DRC's contribution to mitigation will be based on measures coupled with a minimal effort to reduce emissions in relation to the projected emissions by 2030 if the status quo is maintained.</p>
<h3 id="target-level">3.3. Target Level</h3>
<p>Given the volume of investment required to meet the DRC's target for mitigation, in the light of national development priorities, only a minimal portion of its contribution can be financed from its own resources.</p>
<p>These actions will be conditioned by the provision of adequate support in terms of financial resources, technology transfer and capacity building national level. To this end, it is important that access to resources facilitating the implementation of activities within the DRC CPDN to be promoted.</p>
<h3 id="reduction-of-ghg-emissions">3.4. Reduction of GHG emissions</h3>
<p>The DRC is committed to reducing its emissions by 17% by 2030 compared to emissions from the status quo (430 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>e) scenario, a reduction of just over 70 MtCO<sub>2</sub>e avoided (Ministry of the Environment, 2009).</p>
<p>Indeed, the national context is as follows: (i) forest area of ​​the DRC in the order of 152 million ha in 2010 (MEDD, 2015), (ii) deforestation rate between 1990 and 2010 0.32% (MEDD, 2015); (Iii) deforestation and forest degradation caused mainly by commercial (~ 40%) and subsistence (~ 20%) and by cutting firewood (~ 20%)<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>. Provision is made for projects to plant around 3 million hectares of forest by 2025 under the afforestation and reforestation<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> programs, which would allow the sequestration of approximately 3 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p><img src="img/COD-2.png" width="610" height="304" /></p>

<p>Figure 4 : Breakdown of the cost of emissions reduction by leverage (in millions of USD).</p>
<h3 id="sectors-and-gases-involved.">3.6. Sectors and gases involved.</h3>
<p>The sectors concerned are LULUCF, Agriculture and Energy. The GHGs concerned are CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O. The Industrial Processes and Waste sectors are not taken into account given their minimal contribution to the GHG emissions balance in the DRC.</p>
<h3 id="counting-methodology.">3.7. Counting methodology.</h3>
<p>In accordance with the GHG emission accounting and reporting rules, the DRC CPDN has used the 1996 Revised Guidelines and the 2006 IPCC, the methodological guidance of the Convention for the estimation of emissions Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and reporting, and complementary ALU (Agriculture and Other Land Use) methodologies and Guides to Good Practice (IPCC 2000 and 2003).</p>
<h3 id="implementation-of-institutional-arrangements.">3.8. Implementation of institutional arrangements.</h3>
<p>For the implementation of its CPDN, given that the Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable Development (MEDD) has a technical responsibility for the implementation of the country's environmental policy, the DRC will rely on the mechanism already in place. Implementation of government action on climate change, through the Directorate of Sustainable Development (DDD).</p>
<p>For the implementation of the various initiatives of the projects, the DDD sets up a multisectoral and multidisciplinary team of experts for the definition and design of methodologies, data collection, data processing, Implementation of climate change related tasks. This team is set up as a consultation and information group to ensure the coherence of the proposed methods.</p>
<h3 id="equity-and-ambition">3.9. Equity and ambition</h3>
<p>The DRC is one of the Least Developed Countries and is the country with the lowest human development index according to the 2014 Human Development Report. The country therefore faces many challenges in terms of socio-economic development. In addition, the country must minimize the risks of climate change impacts, due to the high vulnerability of certain economic activities, such as agriculture and forestry.</p>
<p>The DRC's contribution to global GHG emissions is very low (about 0.5% in 2010).</p>
<p>Moreover, the GHG intensity relative to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is also very low.</p>
<p>The country, with its very large forest cover of 152 million ha in 2010 (MEDD, 2015), is a net carbon well. Despite this, the DRC proposes to implement mitigation actions in order to reduce its emissions by 17%. In this context, the Democratic Republic of the Congo considers its Contribution to be ambitious and equitable.</p>
