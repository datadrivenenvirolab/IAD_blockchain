<p><em>September 2015</em></p>
<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary </h2>
<p>The CPDN of the Union of the Comoros has been based on its Accelerated Growth and Sustainable Development Strategy (SCA2D) as well as its various Climate Change Management programs, the overall objective of which is to Contribute to poverty alleviation, sustainable development and provide adequate solutions to the challenges of climate change</p>
<p>This was the result of a multi-stakeholder consultation process that reviewed all programs, action plans and projects related to the fight against climate change. This process has been enshrined by national authorities through a national workshop on 27-28 July 2015 chaired by the Minister for the Environment. The Union of the Comoros, in deciding to reduce its (GHG) emissions, is conscious of committing itself, on the one hand, to producing laborious actions to mitigate GHGs in order to achieve this In spite of the lack of capacity, and on the other hand, to develop measures to adapt to the negative effects of climate change. These actions are based on sectoral strategies and action plans in areas such as agriculture, waste, forestry, land use, land-use change and forestry (TAF) The energy.</p>
<p>Despite its low contribution to greenhouse gases, the Union of the Comoros wants to pursue its goal of being a carbon sink and thus participate in the global effort to decarbonise the planet.</p>
<p>The ambition of the Union of the Comoros is to reduce its GHG emissions in 2030 by about 84% of the projected emissions for the same year according to a reference scenario. This commitment could only be achieved with the support of the international community to enable the Union of Comoros to access additional sources of financing, in particular through the new climate finance mechanisms, or the Green Climate Fund. This target of a reduction of 441,700 metric tons of CO<sub>2</sub>eq, including LULUCF activities by 2030, requires a total investment of approximately US $ 675 million, of which about 10% could come from the budget national.</p>
<p>Given the lack of data, the CPDN of the Union of the Comoros is called upon to evolve with the implementation of an improved system of data collection and processing more efficient.</p>
<h2 id="section-1.-national-context">Section 1. National Context</h2>
<p>As a small island state of 750 000 inhabitants, the Union of the Comoros is particularly vulnerable to climate change, like other small island developing states). The main hazards affecting the Union of Comoros are the increase in temperature; elevation of sea level (erosion and submersion); more intense tropical cyclones precipitation; the modification of the wind regime; ocean acidification and the modification of fundamental cycles.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Union of Comoros's economy is highly dependent on agriculture, which accounts for about 50% of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the vast majority of the population lives in coastal areas. The effects of climate change are already highly visible and strongly undermine the development efforts undertaken by the Union of Comoros over the last decade. Without ambitious measures, the cost of climate-related impacts could reach US $ 836 million by 2050, representing 130% of current GDP<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The Union of Comoros, whose emissions are negligible at the global level, has made efforts in the last decade to develop a political and strategic framework for sustainable growth and green development, climate resilient and low emission. of carbon.</p>
<p>The Union of the Comoros, as a signatory to the United Nations Convention on Climate Change, wants to contribute to the international effort to combat global warming. The main activities are aimed at increasing the resilience of populations most vulnerable to the effects of climate change while enabling them to improve their incomes and access clean technologies to meet their basic needs (food, health, electricity).</p>
<p>Thus, the Union of Comoros Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) is guided by the desire to pursue the goal of being a carbon sink and promoting sustainable development. This INDC is based in particular on the National Adaptation Program of Action (NAPA), the Natural Environment Strategic Programming Framework, Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction for 2011-2016 and the Growth Strategy. Accelerated and Sustainable Development (SCA2D) for 2015-2019.</p>
<p>Despite its low contribution to Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, the Union of Comoros wants to pursue its goal of becoming a carbon sink and thus participate in the global decarbonisation effort. of the planet. In order to reduce its energy dependence on the outside world and to meet the needs of its most vulnerable populations, the Union of Comoros would like to further develop its prospects for renewable energies.</p>
<h2 id="section-2.-attenuation">Section 2. Attenuation</h2>
<h3 id="contribution">2.1. Contribution</h3>
<p><em>The Union of the Comoros is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 84% by 2030 in relation to the emissions of the reference scenario of the same year. This reduction includes removals from the Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (UTCAF) sector as well.</em></p>
<p>The share of GHG emissions from the Union of the Comoros at global level is minimal but the country is ready to contribute to mitigation and adaptation as well as means of implementation.</p>

<h4>2.1.1 Potential for mitigation of measures</h4>
<p>The key sectors for mitigation are UTCAF and Agriculture because the means are quite restrictive for the Energy sector on the basis of the data and the current situation. However, geothermal energy remains an asset and should receive maximum attention in order to be exploited in the near future. The national mitigation target is to reach 46% in 2020 to transit to 69% in 2025 and reach 84% in 2030.</p>

<p><em><strong>2.1.1.1 Approach</strong></em></p>
<p>A mixed approach, based on actions and actions for the IPCC key sectors and sectors, was adopted as they offer the highest mitigation potential. Secondly, an assessment of the potential for success was undertaken based on national circumstances in order to prioritize the best potential. The mitigation potentials were thus determined for each prioritized activity area and the values obtained were then aggregated to arrive at the national level. This approach will also facilitate the preparation of a detailed and precise plan for implementation, as the actions to be taken into account have already been identified.</p>
<p><em><strong>2.1.1.2 Foundation or Reasoning</strong></em></p>
<p>The Energy and Residential Industries categories were chosen because they are key sources and also offer other beneficial effects in addition to mitigation. Access to electricity, especially green electricity, would help the country's development, improve air and environmental quality, and reduce the pressure on forests for wood. Hydro and solar have been favored to the detriment of hydrocarbons without eliminating wind, while geothermal energy has been taken into account by 2030. Wind power has yet to be studied before its place in the Energy mix. During the period 2010-2030, renewable energies will evolve from around 3% to almost 43%, with geothermal production accounting for 16% if the operation is carried out. Other measures include energy control during processing and transmission, and energy efficiency through improved fireplaces, improvements in carbonization and stills, among others.The impacts in terms of emission reductions for the latter have been accounted for under the Forestry sector because they will intervene through a reduction in timber harvesting.</p>
<p>In the Agriculture sector, the method of breeding makes it difficult to mitigate in the time frame considered for this exercise. Conservation agriculture has been analyzed but emissions that could be avoided have not been quantified because they remain fairly random.</p>
<p>Forestry has been particularly targeted because it is the largest emitter of GHGs and it also offers a great possibility of sequestration in the country. Targeted measures concern the protection of forest areas, deforestation, reforestation, afforestation, agroforestry and arboriculture while investing the necessary efforts to reduce the consumption of wood from forests. A holistic approach has been worked on for sustainable forestry and taking into account the needs of the wooden population for its energy and other needs. Thus, it is planned to reforest some 12 000 ha during the period 2018 to 2030. The area under agroforestry and arboriculture will evolve at a rate of 200 ha per year from 2018 to 2030. Existing protected areas will be extended to 50 000 ha in 2030.</p>
<p>The CPDN plans to introduce improved management of household solid waste through composting. The table below summarizes the various measures taken into account and their potential for reduction.</p>

<h2>Section 3. Adaptation</h2>
<h3>3.1 Adaptation Strategy: long-term vision</h3>
<p>The challenge of the development of the different islands is increasingly being combined with that of adaptation to climate change. The sustainability of growth and its security will necessarily result in a better understanding of the adaptation dimension to climate change.</p>
<p>The Government is also aware that those most vulnerable to the effects of climate change are rural communities and poor farmers who too often lack the capacity to resist these impacts.</p>
<p>Among other things, it will be important to: (i) enforce regulations on the restoration of degraded areas, (ii) promote intensive agriculture, (iii) increase the involvement of women and communities in Decision-making in the field of environmental protection in view of their growing role in the development of the domestic economy; And (iv) building people's resilience to disasters and climate change.</p>
<p>To this end, the country will have to successfully integrate climate change adaptation measures into the various sectoral policies, build capacity and finally mobilize adequate financial resources.</p>
<h3>3.2 Current or planned short term actions</h3>
<p>The Union of the Comoros has a very high vulnerability to climate change due in particular to its low adaptive capacity. In this context, the fight against poverty contributes to the fight against climate change by reducing vulnerability. Similarly, many vulnerability reduction projects aim to reduce poverty. It is important that actors are made aware of this two-way link between poverty reduction and adaptation through the reduction of vulnerability. Indeed, this very fine line between the two approaches, sometimes indistinct, can lead to a lack of understanding of the real significance of adaptation in relation to a traditional poverty reduction strategy.</p>
<p>Today four major climate change adaptation projects are underway or will start and two projects are under development. They target the water and agriculture sectors and the integration of adaptation into sectoral policies (see Table 4).</p>

<h2>Section 4. Equity and ambition</h2>
<p>The CPDN will be developed to be fair and ambitious for the Union of the Comoros, while ensuring that it contributes to the ultimate objective of the Convention to stabilize the level of GHGs in the atmosphere to a non-harmful level to the proper functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. Given that Comoros emissions account for a very small proportion of global greenhouse gas emissions, the country has therefore focused on measures that are compatible with its small island state, LDC and rapidly impacting status.</p>
<p>Comoros ranks 159 out of 187 countries according to the UNDP Human Development Index (HDI) ranking with an HDI of 0.488 in 2014. With a per capita GDP of US $ 840 in 2014<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, the Comoros is struggling to create Sustainable economic growth<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>. To effectively combat poverty, the country has committed itself to a sustainable development goal by signing the Istandra manifesto. With a majority of the population living in the coastal regions, poverty reduction activities have concentrated on coastal zone protection, risk management and so on. Whose main effects will reduce vulnerability.</p>
<p>From GHG sinks in the year 2000, the Union of the Comoros issued its emissions in 2015 based on the projection of the reference scenario and on the basis of the inventories of the years 2000, 2005 and 2010. In 2010, emissions from Comoros Accounted for a very small proportion of global greenhouse gas emissions, 0.00045%. The country has increased its efforts over the past decade towards sustainable growth and green, climate-resilient and carbon-neutral development at both political and institutional levels. Climate change (CC) actions in terms of mitigation and adaptation have been carried out since the 1990s. In addition, through the actions implemented so far, GHG emissions per inhabitant have been Be maintained at the 0.4 ton level during the period 2000 to 2010. Despite its low contribution to greenhouse gases, the Union of the Comoros wishes to pursue its goal of being a carbon sink and Participate in the global effort to decarbonize the planet.</p>
<p>But for this, the capacity of the country to implement its contribution also has its limitations. Indeed, the current level of economic development in the medium term has been used to develop the mitigation and adaptation potential and therefore its contribution while taking into account the country's development priorities of poverty reduction and other Millennium Development Goals.</p>
<p>This contribution is considered fair for the Comoros to enable the international community to achieve the ultimate objective of the Convention on Stabilization of GHGs in the atmosphere, in particular to keep the global warming level below the critical threshold Of 2 ¬∞ C which would destabilize the functioning of natural ecosystems.</p>
<p>The Union of the Comoros aspires to transform its economy through activities contributing to the minimum GHG emissions, namely in the energy and UTCAF sectors, in order to achieve a neutral GHG emission economic development, if not a well. However, financial and technical support from the international community is a prerequisite for the success of this contribution to the achievement of the objective of the Convention.</p>
<p>The Union of the Comoros is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by about 84% in 2030 compared to the emissions under the reference scenario, subject to the international assistance mentioned. This represents close to 440,000 tCO<sub>2</sub>eq</p>

<h2>Section 5. Institutional Arrangement</h2>
<p>The Union of the Comoros will use the existing monitoring and evaluation mechanisms for the implementation of the CPDN. Thus the existing institutional arrangements will be consolidated to enable the implementation and monitoring of the CPDN. The National Council for Sustainable Development (CNDD), set up in 2013, will carry out the program in collaboration with the Ministries and the other Directorates concerned according to the measures and actions. However, the operational nature of this commission would require financial resources to be truly effective.</p>
<p>The follow-up of the CPDN can be done through the GHG inventories of the National Communications and the Biennial Reports which will be transmitted to the UNFCCC. Particularly with regard to adaptation measures, monitoring could be carried out through the sectoral working groups and the Development and Monitoring and Evaluation Committees (COPSED).</p>
<h2>Section 6. Means of implementation</h2>
<h3>6.1 Constraints and Needs</h3>
<h4>6.1.1 Contraints</h4>
<p>Despite its low contribution to greenhouse gases, the Union of the Comoros wishes to pursue the objective it has set itself of remaining a carbon sink and thus participate in the global effort of decarbonisation of the planet.</p>
<p>The analysis of the different components of the economy shows that the Union of the Comoros is in the process of reconstruction and reform as a fragile country. Many efforts have been made in the last 20 years in the field of sustainable development, particularly adaptation, but these efforts are scattered and their results little measurable.</p>
<p>This is due to many shortcomings identified by various studies (such as the ANCAR, the National Report of the UN Conference on Sustainable Development, the Mauritius Report, and the Strategic Programming Plan) and Institutional, political and strategic and legal.</p>
<h4>6.1.2 Adaptation needs and mitigation</h4>
<p>Faced with these constraints and in order to meet these challenges, the human, technical and financial needs are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The country's lack of domestic financial resources increases its dependence on external aid. All adaptation projects are financed by external aid. This dependence favors the project approach to the detriment of the program approach. The Union of the Comoros must ensure the sustainability of actions and move from a project mode to a more or less long-term program and ensure a sustainability of funding as well;</li>
<li>Institutions in charge of adaptation and mitigation lack human, technical, financial and material resources. Moreover, the texts defining the mandates, missions and responsibilities of the institutions (Union and islands) involved in the management and protection of the national environment would need to be revised in order to gain clarity. As a result, its institutions are very limited in their design capacities, planning implementation of adaptation and mitigation actions. They are also handicapped in their missions of coordination, animation, coaching and awareness-raising;</li>
<li>As in the case of adaptation and mitigation, risk management in the Comoros lacks a regulatory framework and coordination mechanism between the different actors<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>. In the absence of financial resources, limited state resources have been used in response to emergencies rather than prevention. The basic data is sorely lacking and the survey results show that civil society was not sufficiently aware and prepared to deal with natural disasters</li>
<li>The need for technology transfer is inherent in the adaptive measures and projects to be implemented and therefore affect most of the identified areas.</li>
</ul>
<h4>6.1.3 Implementation</h4>
<p>The CPDN has been working to produce the expected results quickly in view of the urgency of the situation in order to achieve the objective of the Convention. Thus, a period of one to two years has been taken into account in order to allow the creation of the favorable environment and the establishment of the necessary system. Meanwhile, it is also hoped that the required resources will be available to carry out this task so essential for the future of our planet.</p>
<p>Implementation of the CPDN represents a challenge for the Union of the Comoros. Multiple challenges will need to be addressed in areas such as human capacity building, technology needs and financial needs in order to carry out this NPDC while meeting the deadlines set at the various stages.</p>
<p>The Union of the Comoros is counting on the international community to consolidate the efforts made in the fight against climate change for more than 20 years. Indeed, international support in the form of financing, capacity building and technology transfers will be paramount in order for the Union of Comoros to implement its CPDN:</p>
<ul>
<li>Financial support - The Union of Comoros will need an envelope around US $ 675 million to complete the implementation of its CPDN, of which US $ 375 million for mitigation measures and US $ 300 million for environmental adaptation measures. Given its very limited resources, the Union of the Comoros cannot undertake its measures without the help of the international community. However, the share of the national budget could be about 10% of this envelope based on the experience of projects in the Comoros. Given the urgency of the situation in order to stabilize the GHG content of the atmosphere, the Union of the Comoros has set itself the objective of starting the implementation as soon as possible for the expected effects, Beginning in the year 2018;</li>
<li>Capacity building support - The Union of the Comoros is severely lacking in capacity to implement, monitor and report on the initiatives that will be put in place for the CPDN. The Union of the Comoros relies on the solidarity of the international community to provide the necessary support. Capacity building needs are quite broad and include human capacity in various areas, institutional capacity, legal, legal and financial framework, better planning in terms of policy, strategy and action plan; And better tracking of operations; By way of illustration, capacity building needs are important tools for mainstreaming the effects of climate change into strategies, policies and action plans, on the one hand, and the area of monitoring and evaluation. In the area of risk management, capacity building of geographic information systems (GIS) and risk assessment and civil society awareness and preparedness for risk management are priorities.</li>
<li>Technology transfer - Technology transfer is an integral part of the CPDN,as it is through them that many of the initiatives in terms of mitigation and adaptation will take place. The need for technologies will extend over most of the duration of the CPDN. They include mitigation of renewable energy technologies such as solar, hydro, wind and geothermal, energy efficiency in the building and other industries, afforestation techniques, agroforestry, Arboriculture, conservation agriculture or agroecology, agricultural product processing, preservation and restoration of forests and other protected areas. As far as adaptation is concerned, the transfer of technology for the energy, forestry and agriculture sectors mentioned above is also relevant. They should, however, be complemented by technology transfers in the water, health and risk prevention sectors (examples: pumping system, capture, storage, decantation, filtration, volcanic monitoring network, acquisition and treatment of Satellite images).</li>

<p>In order to develop a robust, feasible, equitable and ambitious CPDN, the bottom-up approach to reaching the national contribution was favored. The mitigation measures have been developed in line with the policies and other existing strategies of the Government of the Union of the Comoros and national specificities. A detailed description of the assumptions and projections used to project emissions and removals follows for each prioritized option. The national reports and work of other countries in the region and the islands of the Indian Ocean and international databases were also used to supplement the missing data or for validation purposes</p>

<h4>7.1.2 GHG Emissions and Projections</h4>
<p><strong><em>7.1.2.1 Methodologies</em></strong></p>
<p>The 2006 IPCC Guidelines and IPCC 2006 software were used to estimate emissions and removals by equation</p>
<p>Emissions = Activity data * Emission factors</p>
<p>The same methodology was adopted for compiling emissions from baseline and mitigation scenarios, namely the 2006 IPCC Guidelines and IPCC 2006 software as recommended by the Conference of the Parties to be consistent and comparable. Activity data are derived from country statistics for the past and projections obtained from sector development strategies or strategies. In cases where projections do not exist, statistical modeling or the trend line were used to estimate future needs. Exercises were made on the basis of population growth, the rate of urbanization, GDP and Rate of deforestation among others.</p>
<p>Activity data include the country's energy needs and outputs, fossil fuel volumes, livestock numbers, the volume of wood harvested and the amount of household waste produced. Population growth and other socio-economic parameters were taken from projections made in the country's development strategies.</p>
<p><em><strong>7.1.2.2 National level Emissions</strong></em></p>
<p>Absorption and emissions in tCO<sub>2</sub>eq. by sector for the three revised inventory years, 2000, 2005 and 2010 are shown in Table 5. The latter shows that Energy, Agriculture and UTCAF are the key sectors in terms of emissions. These three sectors were therefore favored for mitigation purposes.</p>

<p><em>Energy: </em></p>
<ul><li>Reduce losses on the electrical distribution network</li></ul>
<p>At present, losses on the distribution network, according to the report "Development of a national energy sector strategy in the Comoros", reach 30%. The rehabilitation of the network is one of the flagship measures of mitigation because it can be implemented fairly quickly with concrete results from the year 2020. Thus, the hypothesis is a rehabilitation of the network to bring down this loss to 15 %.</p>
<ul><li>Rehabilitating Power Plants</li></ul>
<p>Hydrocarbon electricity generators are poorly maintained due to lack of human resources and capabilities. This is one of the other measures that would benefit from being put in place with diligence with immediate results. Currently the transformation in the power stations losses are estimated at 8% and a reduction to 6% is foreseeable.</p>
<ul><li>Adoption of solar</li></ul>
<p>The penetration of photovoltaics has been worked to integrate the system from the year 2020 in order to reach the national objectives of electricity produced from renewable sources. Thus, the exploitation of a potential of 14 MW gradually in three stages was worked.</p>
<ul><li>Increase the hydro potential</li></ul>
<p>Similarly, for the development of electricity from hydro plants until 2030 with the aim of reaching the maximum potential of the country.</p>
<ul><li>Geothermal</li></ul>
<p>Geothermal energy has been in the pipeline for a few years now and the government is confident that it will be a potential source of renewable energy for electricity generation in the future. Given the time needed to complete the studies and start electricity generation, it was considered that by the end of the period under analysis, namely around 2030. Thus, the accounting for GHGs that could be avoided was taken In consideration for the year 2030. A production of some 14 MW by 2030.</p>
<ul>
<li>Promote the use of LPG in place of oil and wood</li></ul>
<p>Extending the use of LPG by households and possibly replacing gasoline in cars would also reduce emissions. An annual penetration of 3% of consumption was taken as an assumption, without, however, distinguishing the end-uses.</p>
<ul><li>Promote improved fireplaces</li></ul>
<p>This option has not been evaluated for its mitigation capacity as its adoption has not been very successful despite the efforts invested. Moreover, the results remain difficult to quantify. For the purposes of the study, it was considered that the introduction of improved households and Ylang Ylang essential oil production would lead to a gradual 5% decrease at 2020, 2025 and 2030 Of the volume of wood used. Therefore, the emission reductions estimates were made together under the option of reducing the volume of firewood. This reduction in the volume of wood used is included with other actions considered under the UTCAF section below where emission estimates are normally made.</p>

<p><em>Agriculture:</em></p>
<ul><li>Promoting conservation agriculture</li></ul>
<p>Conservation agriculture, as well as improved households, is making a timid breakthrough among farmers. This option is also difficult to evaluate and project in the future. It has therefore not been quantified for its impact on GHG emissions.</p>
<p><em>LULUCF</em></p>
<ul><li>Reduction of fuelwood, service and industrial consumption</li></ul>
<p>Consumption of wood from forests and other biomass reserves accounts for the largest share of GHG emissions currently. In addition, it is a source of land degradation with negative effects on other sectors such as food crop production and livestock breeding. It is therefore an important activity to target in order to reduce emissions. It is necessary to consider this problem in an integrated way because it is transversal and linked to other residential and industrial activities. Indeed, the measures favored in the other sectors go in this direction, such as the rate of electrification, the promotion of LPG, the extension of improved households and industrial needs, and the substitution of service wood for other materials .</p>
<p>The hypothesis is to reduce this use by 15% every five years, which would put a brake on deforestation and which would lead to a reduction of deforestation by 45% in 2030.</p>
<ul><li>Afforestation of grassland or other wasteland</li></ul>
<p>With time and lack of resources, the area under grassland has increased in the island following deforestation and today this state of affairs has negative effects on other sectors. Reforestation and afforestation have been common practices for more than a decade but have not been very successful in the light of national circumstances. We note the low success rate of seedlings planted due to poor control of climatic variations and livestock divagation. The objective of the national policy, the SCA2D, is to cover an area of 11116 ha by 2019, equivalent to 6% of the area of the territory. Afforestation on part of this area with commercial wood species is an ideal solution because it would allow the sequestration of carbon dioxide while providing the wood required for residential, serviced and industrial needs. As a result, the plan would be to start with afforestation followed by reforestation with native species a few years later. This approach to the implementation of the reforestation program takes into consideration the preparation of seedlings and other associated measures.</p>
<ul><li>Reforestation</li></ul>
<p>Better reforestation planning is needed and will require more investment to ensure its success. The Union of the Comoros aims to reforest 2,200 ha annually over a 5-year period from 2015 to 2019 in order to be in line with the SCA2D. But the implementation seems difficult because it has not been possible to raise the necessary funding to date. This area has therefore been distributed in reforestation and afforestation over 12 years from the year 2018, subject to finding the financing. This approach will reduce the pressure on the forest resource over time with the aim of sustainable exploitation in the medium and long term. Of the associated benefits will be obtained in relation to the degradation of soil and water resources. Indirectly, this latter aspect will inherently have positive effects on the sustainability of the production of other sectors related to water.</p>
<p><em>Agroforestry:</em></p>
<p>For agroforestry, abandoned agricultural land will be targeted for this activity. The intention is to convert 200 ha annually for agroforestry. This while being a GHG well will also create employment and generate wealth to the communities.</p>
<p><em>Arboriculture:</em></p>
<p>For arboriculture, once again the abandoned agricultural land will be converted at the rate of 200 ha annually. While being a GHG well, this activity will create employment, help food security and generate wealth for communities.</p>
<p><em>Protected Area:</em></p>
<p>The Comorian government has planned to strengthen its actions for the conservation of marine and terrestrial biodiversity. Thus, it is planned to move to a total of 50 000 ha of land under vegetation cover, mainly forests, of protected areas by 2030. The summary of emission reductions through mitigation measures for the LULUCF sector is presented in the Table below</p>

<p><em>Wastes</em></p>
<p>There is a solid and liquid waste management policy but its implementation is not yet effective. The projects identified for household waste include composting after sorting and burial in large agglomerations and the production of biogas elsewhere.

<h2>7.2 Adaptation</h2>
<h3>7.2.1 Context: trend and vulnerability to climate change</h3>
<p>The Union of the Comoros is an archipelago, located to the North of the Canal of Mozambique. This state, like other island developing countries, is characterized by its very high vulnerability to the impacts of climate change.</p>
<p>In the South-West Indian Ocean, the study of the data available over the last 50 years already reveals a significant warming over the whole basin with a significant regional average increase of + 0.2 ¬∞ C per decade As well as a decrease in annual rainfall for the period. These trends are confirmed on the Comoros scale.</p>
<p>By 2050, climate change will show a slight increase in rainfall relative to normal for the months of January to April and December. Unlike other months where rainfall declines.</p>
<p>At the national level, these changes will be manifested by an increase in temperature from 1.26 to 1.47 ¬∞ C.</p>
<p>The warming will be even more pronounced in the year 2100 with a variation of 1.99 to 2.35 ¬∞ C. In general, thermal variation would have almost doubled from 2050 to 2100 if no mitigation measures are taken. For rainfall, there will be a significant decline for the months of August to November.</p>
<p>Sea level is expected to increase by 4mm per year over the next fifty years. This increase corresponds to a potential average increase of 20 cm, an increase twice as high as the elevation observed over the last hundred years (20 to 25 cm).</p>
<p>The proportion of vulnerability is estimated at 82.1%, with damage caused by climate change, which exceeds the value of GDPa by 2020. Vulnerability of the Comoros is based on sensitivity to climate hazard and adaptive capacity. It depends on physical, human and socio-economic factors; The country's poverty being the main cause. The main hazards impacting the Comoros are:</p>
<ul><li>Increasing temperature</li>
<li>Sea-level rise (erosion and submersion);</li>
<li>The change in the precipitation regime</li>
<li>Changes in the wind regime;</li>
<li>Ocean acidification;</li>
<li>The modification of fundamental cycles.</li>
