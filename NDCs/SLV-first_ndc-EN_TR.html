<h2 id="contribution-established-and-determined-at-the-national-level-of-salvador">CONTRIBUTION ESTABLISHED AND DETERMINED AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL OF SALVADOR</h2>
<p><strong>San Salvador</strong></p>
<p><strong>November 2015</strong></p>
<h2 id="general-framework">General Framework</h2>
<p>El Salvador presents this Nationally Determined Predicted Contribution (CPND), based on the premise that the negotiation of the 2015 agreement is carried out and concretized under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and is legally governed and governed For its principles and provisions, with a view to improving the full, effective and sustained implementation of the Convention and achieving its objective. The country is committed to the adoption of a new binding agreement applicable to all Parties, and hopes that under this new legal instrument the global average temperature increase will be limited to 1.5 ºC . The implementation of the CPND of El Salvador depends on the achievement of an ambitious agreement, with which society as a whole is committed, and has the necessary international support that facilitates resources and promotes and stimulates investments to strengthen resilience and the construction of a low carbon development. The CPND will be updated periodically and as appropriate.</p>
<p>Historically and so far, El Salvador has generated very low greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, so its contribution is not significant globally. Therefore, in view of the significant impacts and effects that the phenomena associated with climate change already have on our development process and efforts to overcome poverty, the CPND on adaptation is of the greatest importance and priority for the country. Despite this, El Salvador is firmly committed to achieving a substantive and equitable global 2015 agreement to address the threat of climate change by developing its best mitigation efforts, prioritizing those actions and contributions that entail socio-economic co-benefits And promoting, where appropriate, the adaptation-based mitigation approach as indicated in its ecosystem and landscape restoration programs and other forest-related initiatives.</p>
<p>In the process of preparing its CPND, El Salvador presents a series of contributions aimed firstly at establishing a framework of legislation and institutional arrangements that guide economic and social development towards low emissions and adaptation to climate change. Likewise, some quantitative targets are presented by 2025 and 2030, which will be duly agreed upon, quantified and presented in some cases before COP 22 and COP23.</p>
<p>It is also important to emphasize that the implementation of the actions identified has as a requisite access to the necessary means of implementation and financing. In that sense, full compliance with the commitments assumed by El Salvador in its CPND is subject to the fact that destructive impacts and damages of meteorological phenomena associated with climate change or other geological risks inherent in the region do not alter the expected availability of resources, the baseline from which the goals of the contributions have been established or that alter the framework of national priorities, especially those of attention to population in situation of vulnerability. The same applies in the case of economic shocks that significantly affect trade relations and national income forecasts.</p>
<p><strong>1. Context and socioeconomic impacts of climate change in El Salvador and levels of greenhouse gas emissions.</strong></p>
<p>According to the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report, Central America has traditionally been characterized as a region with high exposure to geo-climatic hazards derived from its location and topography and high vulnerability to its human settlements (ECLAC, 2010c). It has also been identified as the tropical region most sensitive to climate change. “(Giorgi, 2006).”(Table 27-1, page 1508. Report of Working Group ll).</p>
<p>In Central America there is ample evidence of climatic variability at various time scales, ranging from intra-seasonal to long-term variability. Climate change increases climate variability and changes rainfall patterns such as: a) The Pacific and Atlantic Ocean systems are more influential; B) much more intense rains are recorded, and c) Events of excessive rain or lack of rain of longer duration.</p>
<p>Consequently, most of the regional territories face a high physical exposure of their population to the natural climatological, meteorological and hydrological threats. According to the Socioeconomic Vulnerability Index (IVS) and the Municipal Manifest Risk Index (IRM), one hundred fifteen of the two hundred and sixty-two municipalities of El Salvador are in a situation of medium, high and extreme vulnerability, where 63.3% of the population. 9.2% of them are in Extreme Socioeconomic Vulnerability, concentrated mainly in the departments of San Vicente and San Miguel. On the other hand, the Salvadoran territory is part of the so-called Dry Corridor of Central America, which is a group of ecosystems that combine in the tropical dry forest eco-region with biophysical conditions and temperature, evotranspiration and precipitation. The Dry Corridor due to these natural conditions is characterized by cyclical phenomena of severe and high drought, coupled with the misuse of land and inadequate agricultural practices, expansion of the agricultural frontier without regulation, proliferation of human settlements without planning, high vulnerability Of the small producers of basic grains and a lack of land use, represents one of the most vulnerable areas in the region.</p>
<p>These high levels of physical exposure to climatological phenomena in highly vulnerable populations have an impact on the economic and social environment, causing damage and losses that amount to several hundred million dollars. These resources displace public and private investment and reduce the stock of Capital to the detriment of territorial economic growth and generate a strong impact on the hope and quality of life of the population<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In El Salvador, considering that extreme hydro-meteorological events are those that produce a precipitation above 100 mm in 24 hours and an accumulated precipitation of more than 350 mm in 72 hours, it is significant the progressive increase of these extreme climatic phenomena. One was recorded in the sixties, another in the seventies, two in the eighties, four in the nineties in the first decade of this century. The Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) has pointed out that from 1980 to 2008, an average of 1.5 natural disasters per year resulted in the deaths of almost 7,000 people, affected 2.9 million more and had an estimated cost of US $ 470 million per year, equivalent to 4.2% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The annual economic damages related to climatological phenomena are high; Only between November 2009 and October 2011, more than USD $ 1.3 billion was lost or the equivalent of 6% of GDP in 2011.</p>
<p>In the last six decades, the average annual temperature in El Salvador has increased by more than 1.3 degrees Celsius, when the average global temperature has risen by only 0.8 above the prevailing average in the pre-industrial era. At the same time, in that period the sea level increased almost 8 centimeters. An analysis by the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (MARN) and the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) of daily precipitation records for the period 1971-2011 showed that in the decade 2001-2011 there was a strong Increase in events that exceeded the threshold of 100 mm, 150 mm and 200 mm in two days, five days and 10 rainy days, respectively relative to previous decades, breaking various records of intensity and duration, as described in detail in The Second National Communication. As a result of this dynamic, El Salvador has experienced an increase in the last decade of disasters linked to extreme hydro-meteorological events, such as; Low Pressure E96 / Ida, Tropical Storm Agatha; Tropical Depression 12E and severe and recurrent meteorological droughts from the years 2012 to 2015. In 2015 there were two phenomena of severe meteorological drought, with 20 and 24 consecutive dry days each; The meteorological drought of 2014 reached 31 consecutive dry days, the one of 2013 reached 23 and the one of 2012 reached 32.</p>
<p>Projected climate scenarios point to increases of 2 to 3 degrees Celsius over the next six decades, depending on global efforts to mitigate global warming, within the framework of the commitments set forth in the 2015 agreement The temperature rise, coupled with anticipated changes in precipitation patterns, will have serious implications for water availability, agriculture, food security, infrastructure, power generation, health, tourism and other activities. Areas essential for the economic development and well-being of the Salvadoran population. The foreseeable impacts of climate change will be particularly strong in the coastal-marine area and in the eastern part of the country, affecting territories of strategic importance in terms of their wealth as natural capital, vocation and potential for tourism development.</p>
<p>Increasingly, climatic variability associated with climate change is the main cause of the annual fluctuation of agricultural production in El Salvador as a result of extremes, both rain and drought. This climate variability, exacerbated by global warming and climate change, directly affects the emergence of extreme climatic phenomena that have negative impacts on the socioeconomic development of the country, increase their vulnerability due to their high environmental degradation and significant social deficits Accumulated, pressing their public finances and productive investment; Limiting its economic growth and sharpening its poverty problem.</p>
<p>The Salvadoran economy has been characterized by low growth due to structural factors. The global financial crisis of 2008 implied negative consequences for the country, strongly impacting economic indicators. Exports and remittances fell, unemployment increased and energy and food prices increased (WB, 2015). Between 2007 and 2008, the percentage of poverty increased from 34.6% to 40% and in 2009, the Salvadoran economy recorded a GDP contraction of 3.1%, with a relative stagnation in its lower growth rates 2% per year. Between 2011 and 2013, the economy grew at 1.9% per year, below the average for Latin America and the Caribbean (3.7%). In 2014, growth was 2% (BCR, 2015) and projections for 2015 are 2.4%<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> (BCR, 2015). This economic dynamic described above represents another great challenge for the country.</p>
<p>On the other hand, significant public investment efforts in social protection programs have been positively impacting poverty rates measured by income, going from 34.5% in 2012 to 28.9% of the population living in poverty up to 2013. For the same period, El Salvador, according to the 2014 Human Development Index (HDI), ranks 115th out of 187 classified countries. By slightly raising its HDI from 0.660 in 2013 to 0.662 in 2014.</p>
<p>However, reducing poverty is a complex process. According to the latest Household and Multiple Purpose Survey (EHPM) of 2014, poverty at the national level for that year measured by income increased and reached 31.8% of Salvadoran households; of these, 7.6% were in extreme poverty; While 24.3% are in relative poverty. Similar trend is presented in the measurement through multidimensional poverty indices, this indicates that by 2014 the country has 606 thousand families living in poverty, that is, 35.2% of Salvadoran households. Data that show the difficult task of the fight against poverty that faces the country.</p>
<p>The country must then make important efforts to address the historical social backwardness, which is exacerbated by increasing climate vulnerability and the cycle of low economic growth, coupled with the problem of violence and social insecurity, which threaten social and economic development and adversely affect the quality of life of the population.</p>
<p>Considering the above, the country's climate agenda regarding mitigation and GHG emission reflects that El Salvador in terms of its emission levels, both in percentage terms (0.04% of global emissions) and per capita (1.1 ton), has a non-significant contribution. In that sense, the commitments that the country assumes must be balanced according to its level of responsibility. Nevertheless, the country is committed to the international effort to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emission levels and aims to implement a low emission development model, as established in its National Climate change. The promotion of energy efficiency and the promotion of renewable energies, and the preparation of conditions for this, will be two essential elements of this Predicted Contribution on mitigation, as established in the Five-Year Development Plan 2014-2019.</p>
<p><strong>2. Sustainable Development, national priorities for climate change.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.1. National Priorities Framework</strong></p>
<p>The vulnerability and impacts on socio-economic development described require key and urgent actions. In that sense, El Salvador, in its objective 7 of the 2014-2019 Five-Year Development Plan, states that the country must move towards an environmentally sustainable and climate-resilient economy and society.</p>
<p>In the same vein, the National Climate Change Plan, drafted and approved in 2015, ratifies and defines the orientation of climate change policies, actions and priorities in terms of nationally determined intended contributions. Consequently, the country has begun the process of elaborating the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) of the Convention, which is a fundamental instrument as an extension of the National Climate Change Plan and there is already a draft for the Design a roadmap for it by 2017.</p>
<p>As a requirement for the planning process and implementation of priority actions, El Salvador seeks to use all available opportunities for the development of institutional and technical capacity for the integration of adaptation into sustainable development, including communication and awareness-raising programs on Climate change and public education.</p>
<p>In addition, the country has constituted as a coordinating body at the political level the Cabinet of Environmental Sustainability and Vulnerability, which has the National Council of Environmental Sustainability and Vulnerability (CONASAV) as an advisory arm, thereby promoting the representation and participation of civil society, Private enterprise, academia and NGOs. This institutional framework will be strengthened through a Framework Law on Climate Change, which will establish the necessary institutional arrangements for the proper and sustained management of the NCPC.</p>
<p>As noted above, water resources, agriculture, road infrastructure, health and tourism development are increasingly being affected by climate change, so it is essential to define a strategic framework for action to identify and Priority action to adapt to climate change in these sectors. The intended actions, commitments and national contributions in each of these sectors seek to be synergistic, ensuring that each intervention reports substantive co-benefits on the remaining ones.</p>
<p>In the context of this CPND, priorities for this contribution include actions to strengthen the legal, institutional and capacity building framework in the sectors of infrastructure, water resources, agriculture, health and energy.</p>
<p>Due to the very nature of national contributions, many of the actions described transcend the sphere of government action and require the full involvement and commitment of society and all key actors, including municipalities, private companies, small producers, NGOs, Autonomous institutions, communities, academia, etc.</p>
<p><strong>2.2. Adaptation</strong></p>
<p>The variability in precipitation has a strong impact on the availability and quality of water, both superficial and underground, directly affecting the different uses of the resource especially human consumption and ecosystems, agricultural production, electricity generation, and the economy in General, with implications for the country's productivity and competitiveness. It also has a severe and diverse impact on the health sector, related to different types of diseases, including thermal stress morbidity and mortality, acute diarrheal diseases (EDAs) due to water pollution caused by floods, acute respiratory infections (ARI) And diseases by vectors, aggravated also by the high temperatures. High temperatures also increase crop pests (including Roya), warm waters off the coast generate reduced fishing, and dry pastures impact livestock. On the other hand, intense and sudden rains and violent thunderstorms accompanied by raging winds also cause damage to the agriculture and infrastructure of the cities, causing even loss of human lives.</p>
<p>El Salvador has resorted to sectoral adaptation strategies with emphasis on agriculture, water resources, infrastructure and health, contained in the National Climate Change Strategy and the National Climate Change Plan. Water resources, agriculture, road infrastructure, energy generation, health and tourism, among others; are being increasingly affected by climate change, so it is essential to implement priority actions, under a holistic approach that integrates the need for order and transformation in other activities and functions that adversely impact these sectors and increase their resilience. The National Climate Change Plan is the basis for this articulation of intersectoral actions and for the formulation of this CPDN. Its elaboration has had an important consultation process begun in July 2015</p>
<p><strong>2.3. Damage and loss</strong></p>
<p>The impacts and impacts generated by climate change phenomena in the country are so severe that they jeopardize the immediate and future viability of the country's development, the International Monetary Fund in the report of its Country Consultation Mission, March 2013, concluded After the 2008-2009 crisis, the Salvadoran economy has grown slowly as a result of low domestic investment and the impact of climate shocks. In this sense, the CPND prioritizes support for fiscal, social protection, sectoral and territorial policies. El Salvador, therefore, considers it necessary to develop mechanisms to deal with recurrent losses and damages caused by climate change, according to what is planned for this matter within the National Climate Change Plan and adopting the framework established in this area In the agreements under the Convention.</p>
<p><strong>2.4. Mitigation</strong></p>
<p>The Five-Year Development Plan 2015-2019 (PQD) has established among its objectives and lines of action to promote energy efficiency, promote renewable energy, control emissions from the transport sector and those associated with waste and discharges. Planned contributions in these areas simultaneously bring economic and social benefits that strengthen national conditions for resilient and low carbon sustainable development.</p>
<p>In this sense, low carbon urban development for El Salvador would not only slow down GHG emissions but would also improve the economic competitiveness of urban areas and reduce the incidence of diseases associated with pollution and heat island phenomena in the cities, improving the quality of life and urban comfort.</p>
<p>As an extension of the guidelines established in the PQD, the National Climate Change Plan establishes as one of its priority axes climate-resilient and low-carbon coastal and urban development, including in its implementation the development of National Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs, for its acronym in English). In actions to restore ecosystems and landscapes, to implement the REDD plus Program, and to adapt agriculture to climate change, simultaneously, quantifiable mitigation co-benefits are developed in many cases.</p>
<p>It is essential that these efforts to implement national mitigation contributions to meet the country's commitments to the 2015 agreement, have the support of economic actors and society as a whole. It is imperative to agree on goals and commitments and it will be necessary to have technical and financial support from international public and private resources, new and additional to official development assistance and that correspond to the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities established by the Convention.</p>
<p><strong>3. Nationally determined National Priority Contributions to address the impacts and to mitigate climate change</strong></p>
<p>Nationally determined contributions may be unconditional or conditional upon the appropriate availability of means of implementation provided through existing mechanisms within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change or through support received from other bilateral or multilateral sources.</p>
<p>In this sense, the national contributions raised will be possible provided that the following set of conditions for its implementation are available, such as:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>The country maintains macroeconomic stability and a positive trend of economic growth and poverty reduction.</li>
<li>Existing international financial resources are available to support the above-mentioned commitments, which must be new and additional to official development assistance; Ensuring not only the strengthening of national capacities but also adequate access to technologies, among other types of cooperation</li>
<li>There will not be an extreme climatic event associated with climate change in the next few years that causes losses and damages, and it will be necessary to orientate financial resources to the attention of the country and, at the same time, limit the availability of own resources to support The NDCPs.</li>
<li>We do not face a national impact event that directly affects the allocation of public financial resources, subtracting funding to issues prioritized for the country as education, health and safety.</li>
<li>Access to more efficient and cost-effective technologies to contribute to GHG emission reductions proposed in NCPCs be facilitated through mechanisms established by the Convention</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>3.1. Strengthening of the Institutional and legal framework for the formulation and sustained implementation of the CPND of El Salvador:</strong> Preparation, adoption and entry into force of a Framework Law on Climate Change before 2019.</p>
<p>The challenges of climate change for the country are of such magnitude that the entire national economy, dependent on the safe and accessible supply of water and energy, agricultural inputs, efficient and secure infrastructure and a healthy, educated and trained Is seriously threatened by the increasing impacts of extreme events and by those of slow development that already report the risk of non-viability, low productivity and limited competitiveness in some areas of economic activity, starting with some crops that support the national basic food diet.</p>
<p>Likewise, the country is close to the condition of water stress, with a growing threat being the supply of water to meet the basic human needs at urban and rural level. The increasing demand and the decrease in the availability of the resource are leading to the more intense use of surface water sources, including some with a high degree of contamination that will require very high costs for its purification, as is the case with the lake of Ilopango. In such circumstances, and in the face of the horizon presented to the country by climate change, it is imperative to provide legal and regulatory frameworks that effectively respond to this new national and global reality, which will jeopardize the joint and united action of all sectors of society.</p>
<p>The Framework Law on Climate Change, which will come into force before 2019, will specify the attributions and responsibilities of all entities of the State, all sectors of economic activity, academia and citizens in general to respond to this challenge. The same law will recognize, institutionalize and arrange the pertinent measures to facilitate the mandatory implementation of all the actions or commitments that the country may agree to and take in the face of the new agreement to be adopted in Paris, through appropriate processes of consultation and consensus, in matters of national contributions Determined in adaptation and mitigation of climate change</p>
<p>The Law shall provide for the updating and harmonization of the regulations governing the management of the agricultural, aquacultural, forestry, water, energy, infrastructure, health, education, construction, urban development and transportation sectors in accordance with its principles and Objectives of climate change adaptation and mitigation. The updating of these can be undertaken in parallel with the process of formulation and approval of the Framework Law on Climate Change. This update will include a special section on the responsibility of each sector to regularly prepare the sectoral contributions each sector will contribute to the national contributions that the country will submit periodically to the Convention and its new agreement. It will also provide the appropriate mechanisms for monitoring implementation and reporting results.</p>
<p>This law will provide appropriate institutional arrangements for the formulation and monitoring of the effective implementation of national climate change plans and of the nationally determined contributions that the country develops, the monitoring of their implementation and the mechanisms for reporting to the Convention.</p>
<p>It will also provide the necessary and specific mechanisms of inter-institutional coordination to maintain the dissemination of the information generated by the institutions in the preparation of national contributions and the response actions of different climatic phenomena. To this end, it is necessary to improve the institutional framework and capacity development through the actions foreseen in the National Climate Change Plan. Between these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Training of human resources.</li>
<li>Improvement of inter-institutional and intersectoral coordination.</li>
<li>Improvement of the flow of information and transparency between governmental and autonomous institutions.</li>
<li>Promotion of technology transfer</li>
<li>Curriculum update at the academy.</li>
<li>Create a country dialogue on the theme of Climate Change.</li>
<li>Review and permanently adjust the legal framework on Climate Change, in accordance with the changing circumstances that this reality imposes.</li>
<li>Strengthen enforcement</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3.2. Law of Planning and Territorial Development.</strong> Effective implementation of this Law before 2018 as an enabling instrument for compliance with national actions and contributions in adaptation and mitigation and for the control of land use change<strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3.3. Infrastructure</strong>: Updating of the Law on Urban Development and Construction, Law of Development and Territorial Planning of the Metropolitan Area of ​​San Salvador and rules and regulations of construction before 2019.</p>
<p>Adaptation and mitigation of climate change are essential elements for adequate planning of urban development and infrastructure, in line with economic growth and human development. And without planning for such developments, it is not possible to implement and implement appropriate adaptation and mitigation measures based on social development and sustainable economic growth.</p>
<p>The losses and damages experienced in recent years also highlight the need to invest in infrastructure resilient to the impacts of climate change, to save lives and protect the nation's capital. For this purpose it is necessary to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changing paradigms for a technological innovation in construction with co-benefits in mitigation and adaptation.</li>
<li>Promotion of appropriate bioclimatic and vernacular architecture for different types of infrastructure (provision of basic services such as water, housing, road networks, electrification, etc.)</li>
<li>Densification of housing (privilege housing in height, taking into account the cultural circumstances for its achievement).</li>
<li>Shielding, co-insurance, risk transfer with appropriate options for different types of infrastructure, as foreseen within the National Climate Change Plan.</li>
<li>Create incentives and community systems to reduce the high cost of eco-efficiency, especially in low-income socio-economic classes to improve thermal comfort in homes and offices (bioclimatic architecture, energy efficiency, microclimate, heat islands).</li>
</ul>
<p>3.3.1. The Metropolitan Development Council (CODEMET) will develop and submit by 2018 an initial plan to adapt the Metropolitan Area of ​​San Salvador as part of the national contribution to the first implementation period of the 2015 agreement, establishing the associated percentage reduction of emissions by 2025 In relation to a non-action or BAU (business as usual) trajectory.

<p>3.3.6. In the period 2018-2025 El Salvador will have implemented the second phase or phase of the Integrated Transportation System of the Metropolitan Area of ​​San Salvador (SITRAMSS) covering its north - south axis, developing a massive social awareness component that will ensure citizen involvement so that it reaches its maximum emission reduction potential. The Vice-Ministry of Transport will present the technical studies with the quantitative estimation of that potential. The necessary means of implementation that are outside the reach of national finances will be established for the accomplishment of the goal.</p>
<p><strong>3.4. Water Resources:</strong> El Salvador will promote the effective implementation of a normative framework for the integrated management of water resources before 2017.</p>
<p>Climatic variability makes water resources an area of ​​transversal importance. The events of excess or lack of rain require an integrated management strategy with axes that cover all areas of Salvadoran society. The laws and regulations governing the use of the resource in different sectors will be updated according to and in accordance with the objectives of the same.</p>
<p>The integral and sustainable management of the resource, includes the protection, conservation and recovery of its sources, surface and underground; Recognition of the human right to water, its fair use and rational and equitable distribution based on a hierarchy of priorities, with human access and use of water being the first and foremost. The regulatory framework will include the obligation to submit national contributions for adaptation and mitigation of the water sector in each cycle of implementation of the new climate change agreement, providing institutional arrangements for its preparation, verification of implementation and reporting.</p>
<p>3.4.1. During the period 2021-2025, El Salvador will reduce by 20% the unbilled water losses registered at urban level by 2015, ensuring a more efficient and efficient management of water and the improvement of fair, equitable and safe access for all Population sectors. The necessary means of implementation that are outside the reach of national finances will be established for the accomplishment of the goal.</p>
<p>3.4.2. In the period 2021-2025, El Salvador will implement protection and restoration through appropriate management plans of 70% of the main aquifer recharge areas identified in the National Integrated Water Resources Management Plan.

<p>3.4.5. In the period 2018-2025, El Salvador will begin the process of decontamination of the Acelhuate, Sucio, Suquiapa and Grande de San Miguel rivers. The necessary means of implementation that are beyond the reach of national finances will be established for the accomplishment of the goal. In the achievement of the goal, technologies and processes of citizen participation, main social actors and the private sector that promote the greatest reduction of associated emissions will be identified and implemented.</p>
<p><strong>3.5. Agriculture, livestock and forestry</strong>. Existing Policies and laws related to the regulation of the activity of these sectors will be reviewed, updated before 2019.</p>
<p>Due to the importance of these sectors for El Salvador's economy, water and food security and the need to reduce their vulnerability to climate change, low carbon actions are required. In order to achieve its goals, the necessary means of implementation that are beyond the reach of national finances</p>
<p><strong>3.6. Energy.</strong> Updating of the related legal framework and of the National Energy Policy.</p>
<p>Legislation and regulatory frameworks will be reviewed and updated in order to promote the maximum use of renewable energy at all scales, following criteria of maximum efficiency and cost-benefit. Similarly, regulations will be made available or upgraded to maximize savings and energy efficiency. The National Energy Policy 2010-2024, and all future national energy policy will promote the diversification of the country's energy matrix, prioritizing and making available all available means to promote the development and widespread use, at all scales, of renewable energies. With the aim of achieving this diversification, without generating incentives for the use of energy sources that are more polluting than the country has used until 2015.</p>
<p>3.6.1. Prior to COP 22, the energy generation sector will define a GHG emission reduction target for growth without specific business as usual (BAU) actions by 2025.</p>
<p>3.6.2. Prior to COP 22, the energy generation sector will define and achieve a goal of reducing GHG emissions by 2025, through the implementation of energy efficiency processes and measures; Or, it will define percentages of improvement of the energy efficiency at sectoral level with respect to a baseline established for the year 2010, in relation to a scenario without concrete actions of increase of efficiency for the year 2025. The proposal will present needs of resources Implementation beyond the reach of national finances.</p>
<p>3.6.3. Prior to COP 22, the hydroelectric generation sector will present a plan with targets to be reached in the period 2021-2025, for the restoration and adaptation to climate change of the basins of the main dams of the country and for the improvement of the resilience of the Hydroelectric infrastructure. The proposal will present implementation resource needs beyond the scope of national finance.</p>
<p>3.6.4. Prior to COP 22, the electricity generation sector will define and commit to a target of increasing renewable energy by 2025 at no less than 12% with respect to the total electricity generated in the country in 2014. The Proposal will present implementation resource needs beyond the scope of national finance.</p>
<p><strong>3.7. Health, Environmental Sanitation, Labor and Social Welfare and Transport</strong>. The sectors of health, environmental sanitation, labor and social security and transport will review and update their respective legislation in order to adapt it to the circumstances and threats posed by climate change.</p>
<p>3.7.1. These sectors, in coordination with the municipalities concerned, will present before 2018 an integrated plan for adaptation in health, labor and food and nutritional security to be implemented in the period 2018-2025, with concrete targets for the reduction of environmental pollution and increased resilience to climate change in the country's main urban centers, territories and vulnerable population.

<p><strong>3. Means of implementation</strong></p>
<p>The means of implementation refers to the instruments and support mechanisms needed to achieve the aspiration of the country and contribute to the adaptation and mitigation priorities in line with the commitments set out in the global 2015 agreement.</p>
<p>El Salvador, can hardly cope with NCDs without external support given the limited resources available to them and the need to cover social deficits and the already present effects of climate change. External support is a key element in pushing climate change-related measures, and they condition various proposed goals in their Predicted Contribution. This CPND can therefore be updated in the light of the Paris agreement, particularly as regards financial and technology transfer support.</p>
<p>Accordingly, El Salvador ratifies Article 4.7 of the UNFCCC for the purpose of complying with NCPCs. The extent to which developing countries effectively implement their commitments under the Convention will depend on how the Developed country Parties effectively implement their commitments on financial resources and technology transfer and take full account of economic and social development and the eradication of poverty as the first and essential priorities of the Parties Which are developing countries.</p>
<p>Considering the factors and conditions mentioned above, El Salvador requires effective access to financing mechanisms such as the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and technological mechanisms such as the Center and Technology Network Climate (CTCN for its acronym in English)</p>
<p>The country has the tools to channel national and international resources needed to promote Nationally Determined Expected Contributions and all efforts to promote resilience and low carbon development. El Salvador, will be exploring the adoption of resource management modalities such as Debt Relief for Adaptation to Climate Change to support national priorities and other mechanisms that allow it to channel additional resources to meet its commitments.</p>
