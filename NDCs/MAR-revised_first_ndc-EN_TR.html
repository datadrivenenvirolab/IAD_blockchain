<h2><strong>1. INTRODUCTION</strong></h2>
<p><strong>The Government of Morocco presents here an update of its nationally determined contribution for the period 2020-2030, in accordance with Articles 4.2 and 4.11 of the Paris Agreement, paragraphs 23 and 24 of decision 1 / CP.21 and other relevant provisions of the Agreement.</strong></p>
<p>In terms of mitigation, the updated CDN revises upwards the objectives of the first version of the CDN by presenting a target of 45.5% by 2030, including an unconditional target of 18.3%. These new objectives reflect a significant increase in Morocco's ambition in terms of mitigation. Morocco's updated NDC is multidimensional and anchored in a variety of supporting elements, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>respect for human rights and gender equality, recognized in the Moroccan Constitution of 2011;</li>
<li>synergies to be exploited with the other two Rio Conventions, aimed at restoring, respecting and maintaining biological diversity, integrated management of water resources, as well as sustainable land management to counter desertification and land degradation; soils in its territory;</li>
<li>alignment of actions on climate change, in compliance with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations (UN), particularly goals 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12 , 13 and 17;</li>
<li>the implementation of advanced regionalization, which will strengthen the implementation of the CDN by enhancing the potentialities and resources specific to each region and by encouraging interregional solidarity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite its low contribution to global GHG emissions, Morocco has drawn up its CDN with the firm conviction that global ambitions to tackle the problem of climate change call for a substantial commitment from all parties in terms of mitigation, adaptation than means of implementation, cooperation approaches and transparency.</p>
<p>Morocco, while remaining firmly committed to the Paris Agreement, is determined to pursue the objectives of climate mitigation and adaptation according to its national circumstances and capacities.</p>
<h2><strong>2. NATIONAL PRIORITIES</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Morocco's vision on climate change</strong></p>
<p>Make its territory and its civilization more resilient in the face of climate change while ensuring a rapid transition to a low-carbon economy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Morocco's vision on climate change is anchored in the Framework Law 99-12 on the National Charter for the Environment and Sustainable Development (CNEDD) published in the official bulletin on March 21, 2014 and which specifies "the rights and duties inherent to the environment and sustainable development recognized to natural and legal persons and proclaims the principles that must be respected by the State, local authorities and public establishments and enterprises ”.</p>
<p>This political will is also confirmed by the National Strategy for Sustainable Development (SNDD-2030) and the National Climate Plan (PCN 2030):</p>
<ul>
<li>The SNDD, adopted on June 25, 2017 by the Council of Ministers, aims to achieve a gradual transition to the green economy, taking into account environmental challenges, working to promote human development and social cohesion and consolidating in a sustainable way economic competitiveness;</li>
<li>the development in 2019 of the National Climate Plan for 2030 (PCN 30) constitutes a framework of convergence for the development of a medium and long-term climate policy and offers the country the opportunity to implement its CDNs .</li>
</ul>
<p>The design of PCN 30 is the result of a detailed diagnosis of the vulnerability of Moroccan ecosystems as well as an in-depth analysis of sectoral plans and policies. It includes measures and projects to adapt Morocco's key ecosystems and sectors, particularly in terms of water resources, agriculture, fishery resources and fragile ecosystems. It also proposes to consolidate the mitigation objectives of all sectoral strategies and action plans, particularly in the areas of energy, agriculture, transport, waste, forests, industry. and habita. It takes into account the territorial vocation by advocating the generalization of Regional Climate Plans (PCR) and City Climate Plans (PCV).</p>
<h3><strong>Highlights of the updated NDC</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>In terms of adaptation</strong></h4>
<p>Adaptation is a priority for Morocco, given its great vulnerability to the impacts of climate change. The cost to implement adaptation programs in the most affected sectors is estimated at nearly US $ 40 billion. The sectors concerned are in particular water, agriculture, fishing and aquaculture, forestry, health, housing as well as the most vulnerable environments and ecosystems: oases, coastlines and mountains.</p>
<h4><strong>In terms of mitigation</strong></h4>
<p>Morocco's overall updated objective represents a reduction in GHG emissions from its economy of 45.5% by 2030, including an unconditional objective of 18.3% compared to the reference scenario, which corresponds to a change in emissions. following the “normal course of business” (CNA). The mitigation scenario leading to the headline goal is based on 34 unconditional measures and 27 measures conditional on international funding.</p>
<h4><strong>Funding and investment flows</strong></h4>
<p>The total cost of mitigation actions listed in the NDC is estimated at US $ 38.8 billion including US $ 21.5 billion for conditional actions.</p>
<p>The implementation of the CDN requires significant investments that exceed the capacity of a single actor, and therefore requires enhanced interaction between the Moroccan State, the private sector, and international financial institutions including new financial mechanisms. climate, including the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and the financial instruments of multilateral development banks.</p>
<p>Morocco considers, moreover, to be essential the establishment of market mechanisms in order to promote cooperation between the Parties, as provided for in Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, in particular by reducing total costs to achieve the objective of limiting the rise in temperature, cited in Article 2 of the said agreement.</p>
<h2><strong>3. MITIGATION</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>3.1. Baseline scenario</strong></h3>
<p>The mitigation objectives presented in this updated CDN are in line with current practice in developing countries, i.e. they are expressed in relation to a counterfactual baseline scenario corresponding to a change in emissions following the CNA. by 2030, using 2010 as the base year.</p>
<p>A revision of the baseline scenario during the NDC implementation period may be warranted due to technical updates to the parameters or fundamental changes in the scenario determination methodology. In the case of Morocco, the revision of the reference scenario, on the occasion of the updating of the CDN, is linked to the use of the 2006 guidelines of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC ) instead of those of 1996 (used in the initial NDC) which has an impact on the emissions of the base year 2010, the starting point of the baseline scenario.</p>
<p>Morocco's reference scenario includes all the policies and / or mitigation measures adopted before the 2010 reference year. The policies and / or measures that will be adopted after 2010 will be taken into account for the achievement of the objective of. mitigation. Morocco, a country engaged in the modernization of its productive structures and its demographic transition, has more ambitious economic and social objectives than the extension of the trend of the last decade.</p>
<p>The choice of the 2010 reference year is not arbitrary, it corresponds to the first year of implementation of the National Plan to Combat Global Warming in Morocco.</p>
<p>The following figure presents the global baseline scenario of GHG emissions for all sectors for the period 2010-2030.</p>
<p><strong>Fig. 1. Global baseline of GHG emissions</strong></p>
<p><img src="img/MAR-NDC1-1.png" /></p>

<h3><strong>3.2. Unconditional measures</strong></h3>
<p>The scenario of unconditional mitigation measures includes <strong>thirty-four (34) measures</strong> (Annex 2) on which Morocco commits within the framework of its Nationally Determined Contribution (CDN) taking into account its internal circumstances and capacities. The unconditional objective translates, in absolute terms for 2030, into emissions of 116.1 Mt CO2eq.</p>
<p>All the <strong>unconditional</strong> measures , with an estimated cost of around US $ 18 billion, reduce emissions for the year 2030 by 26,119.2 Gg Eq CO2, or <strong>18.3%</strong> of baseline emissions in 2030.</p>
<h4><strong>3.3. Overall Objective (unconditional and conditional measures)</strong></h4>
<p>The updated NDC presents an overall mitigation target of 45.5% (unconditional and conditional measures) by 2030 compared to the baseline scenario. This new target marks an increase in mitigation ambition compared to the first version of the NDC. It translates, in absolute terms for 2030, into emissions of 77.5 Mt CO2eq if Morocco receives the necessary support to carry out all the measures proposed (unconditional and conditional).</p>
<p>The increased ambition of the updated NDC is attributable to three factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>the revision of the reference scenario following the use of the 2006 IPCC guidelines;</li>
<li>the inclusion of new sub-sectors of Industry, namely the production of cement and the production of phosphates;</li>
<li>the identification of new mitigation actions in the sectors covered by NDC1 and the change in the scope of certain projects.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="img/MAR-NDC1-2.png" /></p>

<h3><strong>3.4. Sector breakdown</strong></h3>
<p>The updated NDC includes <strong>61 mitigation actions</strong> (Annex 1), including <strong>34 unconditional actions</strong> and <strong>27 conditional actions</strong> . Of the 34 unconditional actions, 9 actions, particularly in the energy and agriculture sectors, have already been implemented (partially or totally) before 2020 and will continue to reduce GHG emissions over the period 2020-2030.</p>

<p>Although the transition to a low-carbon economy is a cross-cutting project relying on a range of mitigation measures in all sectors, the power generation and industrial sector (including phosphates and cement) remain the spearhead of the decarbonization of the Moroccan economy. In the electricity sector, Morocco announces the ambition to reach 52% of the installed electrical power from renewable sources by 2030.</p>
<p>For the unconditional objective, the industry sector represents half of the national mitigation effort by 2030, boosted by the phosphate sector alone representing 27.5% of Morocco's objectives in 2030.</p>
<p>The other key sectors included in the updated NDC are: agriculture, land management and forestry, cities, housing and services, transport and waste.</p>

<p><em><strong>Institutional arrangements for the implementation of climate policy</strong></em></p>
<p>Morocco has put in place new institutional governance and technical and financial capacity building mechanisms making its ambitions feasible and realistic, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Institutionalization of the <strong>National Commission on Climate Change and Biological Diversity</strong> . This commission is placed with the government authority responsible for the environment and constitutes a consultation and coordination body to ensure the monitoring of the implementation of the commitments provided for in international conventions and their protocols relating to climate change and climate change. biodiversity, this commission includes two sub-commissions: the Biological Diversity sub-commission and a “Climate change” sub-commission which is made up of 4 working groups depending on the challenges of climate change (Negotiation, Adaptation, Mitigation and Finance) ;</li>

<td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>ii (a). <strong>National circumstances</strong> , such as geography, climate, economy, sustainable development and poverty eradication.</td>
<td><p><strong>Geographical position</strong></p>
<p>Located on the southern shore of the Mediterranean, at the northwestern tip of Africa, at the gates of Europe and at the western edge of the Arab-Muslim world and the Maghreb, Morocco occupies a prime geostrategic position and is always a crossroads of civilizations.</p>
<p>Morocco's particular geographical position gives it a remarkable range of bioclimates, ranging from humid to desert. This results in the great bioecological diversity at its disposal, which is one of the most important in the Mediterranean basin.</p>
<p><strong>Weather</strong></p>
<p>The climate of Morocco is very varied: it is arid and desert in the southern and south-eastern provinces of the Atlas range, temperate in the northern half with the appearance of semi-arid zones, in particular in Souss, Haouz and the Oriental. In fact, the annual average amounts of precipitation deteriorate going from north to south and from north-west to south-east.</p>
<p>Morocco is one of the countries most affected by CC and its impacts. The analysis of climatic data over the period 1960-2018 shows that Morocco has experienced a reduction in precipitation, an increase in temperatures and an increase in the aridity of the climate.</p>
<p>According to the Directorate General of Meteorology (DGM, 2020), the different CC scenarios project a drop in rainfall in Morocco during the winter season. This decrease would be accompanied by an increase in the temporal persistence of the drought. The change in the distribution of precipitation would coincide with a warming which would manifest itself at both the seasonal and annual scales, giving rise to the intensification of extreme meteorological phenomena (heat waves, strong thunderstorms, strong winds.</p>
<p><strong>National economy</strong></p>
<p>The national economy is strongly correlated with the agricultural sector and the global economy. After a year 2016 marked by declining growth (1.6%) due to the drought, the growth rate rose to 4% in 2017. Morocco shows a slowdown in its economic growth, to 3.1% in 2018, which was confirmed in 2019 with a rate of 2.5% and negative growth in 2020 due to the health crisis of covid 19.</p>
<p>The Kingdom is working to promote a better resilience of the Moroccan economy to agricultural fluctuations strongly impacted by climate change. In this sense, important reforms have thus emerged as part of a sectoral diversification strategy (decompensation of gasoline, diesel and industrial fuel oil, adoption of an organic law relating to finance laws - LOLF -, new industrial development plan, new agricultural strategy, etc.).</p>
<p>Beyond the short-term recovery plan, necessary to restart the economy after a difficult year marked by an unprecedented health crisis, defining the ambition for medium and long-term development becomes imperative. This crisis reveals and accelerates fundamental economic trends and also triggers new dynamics. A social Morocco, creator of wealth at the territorial level, with a sustainable carbon-free economy and resilient to climate change, these are the priorities in terms of the development model that the Kingdom should have, in the medium term, after this crisis.</p>
<p><strong>Sustainable development</strong></p>
<p>The Council of Ministers adopted on June 25, 2017 the national strategy for Sustainable Development which aims to achieve a gradual transition to the green economy, taking into account environmental challenges, working for the promotion of human development and social cohesion. and by consolidating economic competitiveness in a sustainable manner.</p>
<p><strong>Fight against poverty</strong></p>
<p>To eradicate the scourge of poverty, the public authorities have opted for sustainable development based on integrated public policies as part of a global project to which all components of society must adhere.</p>
<p>The National Human Development Initiative, launched by HM King Mohammed VI in May 2005, is part of this vision and aims to fight poverty, precariousness and social exclusion through the implementation of support projects. basic infrastructure, training and capacity building projects, social, cultural and sports activities as well as the promotion of income-generating activities and jobs.</p>
<p>The NHRI is in its third phase 2019-2023. This phase is structured around four programs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Program 1: Catching up on deficits in basic social infrastructure and services;</li>
<li>Program 2: Support for people in precarious situations;</li>
<li>Program 3: Income improvement and economic inclusion of young people;</li>

<h2><strong>4. ADAPTATION</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>4.1.  Impact of climate change on sectors and their vulnerabilities</strong></h3>
<p>The Kingdom of Morocco is particularly vulnerable to three types of climatic impacts: increasing temperatures, changes in rainfall patterns and increasing aridity. These types of impacts are associated with the amplification of the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as severe droughts, floods, forest fires, heat and cold waves, and storms. and marine submersions, landslides, locust invasions, or snowstorms. A significant portion of Morocco's population and several key sectors of its economy are particularly vulnerable to these hazards.</p>
<p>Studies of current and projected impacts and vulnerabilities to climate change are carried out by the various key sectors (water resources, agriculture, fishing, forest and biodiversity, coastline, habitat and health). In terms of water resources, the impact and vulnerability analysis has shown that the impact of climate change is estimated at a drop of around 25% in water resources, including the effect of droughts that has known Morocco since the 1980s. The worsening water deficit is the combined result of the decline in surface water resources, underground water and the increase in demand for irrigation water and drinking water. Climate projections according to the RCP8.5 emission scenario for 2050,</p>
<p>The fishing sector in Morocco is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change due to its high exposure to climatic variations and the limited economic means of the actors. Overall, climate projections show that the impact of climate change and the vulnerability of the fishing sector increase in severity as they move from an optimistic scenario to a pessimistic scenario. Indeed, according to a global comparative study of the vulnerability of national economies carried out by Allison et al. (2009), Morocco is ranked 11th among the countries most vulnerable to climate change in the fisheries sector, out of 133 countries.</p>
<p>Forest ecosystems are subject to socioeconomic constraints linked to the precarious conditions of rural user populations, and natural ones, mainly linked to climate change with the increasing aridification of the climate and the accentuation of the risks of extreme and amplified phenomena. by the sensitivity of the land to desertification. Climate change will lead to forest degradation, destruction of ecosystem structures and architecture, and alteration of the range of species. The impacts of climate change, however small they may be on ecosystems, will affect the populations who depend on them by reducing their livelihoods and increasing their exposure to extreme events.</p>
<p>In addition to water, agriculture, fishing and forestry, other sectors are strongly impacted by climate change, particularly housing and health. Projections for 2050 show that the housing sector would be more subject to various climatic hazards (floods, drought, etc.) (MATNHUPV, 2020).</p>
<p>In addition, the last analysis of the vulnerability of the health sector revealed several types of risks, the most important of which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the introduction and emergence of new diseases (malaria, leishmaniasis, etc.);</li>
<li>the increase in respiratory and diarrheal diseases linked to changes in the quality of water, air and food.</li>
</ul>
<p>Morocco's vulnerability is exacerbated by the increased sensitivity of local communities, insufficient climate funding dedicated to adaptation policies and measures, and capitalization in terms of national expertise in the fields of scientific research, forecasting, prevention and climate modeling, as well as increased erosion of biodiversity and environmental services. In the absence of adaptation to climate change, the risks generated by the vulnerability profile will hamper the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
<h3><strong>4.2. Strengthening resilience and adaptation in Morocco: a work in progress</strong></h3>
<p>To face the serious economic and social impacts of current and future climate change, Morocco is committed to promoting effective adaptation measures in priority economic sectors for the climate.</p>
<p>Building resilience to climate risks is one of the pillars on which the National Climate Plan 2030 is based. Climate risks are now taken into account in investment decisions and in development planning.</p>
<p>The priorities of the PCN2030 are included in the National Strategic Adaptation Plan which now constitutes a roadmap for setting up a coordinated national adaptation policy at the national and territorial level.</p>
<h4><em><strong>4.2.1 The National Strategic Adaptation Plan (PNSA): the main orientations (2020-2030)</strong></em></h4>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>PNSA objective</strong></p>
<p>“By 2030, support policy makers and stakeholders at all levels (national, regional and local) to develop and implement, through a collaborative and coordinated approach, coherent and effective policies and measures, placing Man at the center of concerns, in order to adapt and increase the resilience of natural, social and economic systems in the face of the impacts of climate change ”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The PNSA also promotes actions to reduce climate impact through strengthened institutional capacity at national, sectoral and local levels, better knowledge management, and a convergent approach for climate change adaptation and risk reduction. associated with climatic disasters. Although the technical and financial requirements to build resilience to climate change in all economic sectors are still being assessed, it is already clear that significant efforts will be required, as well as the mobilization of innovative solutions, additional financial resources. and institutional capacities for effective adaptation action.</p>
<p>Morocco's climate change adaptation approach also integrates aspects affecting the most vulnerable socio-economic and natural systems, such as the marine coastline, mountains and oases, population groups, and urban and rural communities. . These systems face critical issues that require a coherent and extensive response in the form of transformative adaptation interventions aimed at minimizing climate risks and vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>The PNSA is structured around five axes:</p>

<h4><em><strong>4.2.2. Sectoral objectives to strengthen resilience by 2030 and 2050</strong></em></h4>
<p>One of the objectives pursued by the SNDD, which directly influences the quality of life of Moroccans, is to improve the management and development of natural resources to strengthen the conservation of biodiversity, as well as people's access to safe sources of water. water, promote human development and reduce social and territorial inequalities.</p>
<p>This global objective is the basis of measures targeting key sectors of the Moroccan economy that can contribute to the sectoral and global climate resilience of the country, as well as to its adaptation to climate change. These measures will help achieve the following SDGs: 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15. Morocco's vision for adaptation is broken down into several sectoral objectives quantified for the 2030 to 2050 horizon. Although Morocco is already investing heavily in adaptation, the achievement of these objectives will only be possible with significant support from the international community and donors. The main adaptation objectives are presented in the following table:</p>
