the united nations fao  developing countries are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change because they are highly dependent on natural resources and have limited capacity to respond to these impacts  the adaptation component identifies strategic measures in key sectors in order to improve adaptive capacity enhance resilience and reduce risks caused by climate change thus contributes to the achievement of the countrys sustainable development goals sdgs and national development plan objectives  the most populated province is luanda which contains its capital city  however the country continues to face massive development challenges which include reducing its dependency on oil and diversifying the economy rebuilding its infrastructure and improving institutional capacity governance public financial management systems human development indicators and the living conditions of the population  therefore the electric power sector may need to grow capacity or increase efficiency as it decarbonizes  the capacity of terrestrial ecosystems to capture carbon plays a vital role in reducing the increase of the planets average temperatures  forests have a good capacity to recover from natural climatic variations but the loss of vegetation cover can have consequences in aggravating the impacts of climate change on ecosystems  with the objective of promoting a more sustainable national industry from an energy and environmental point of view the government intends to encourage the replacement of diesel generators by natural gas cogeneration systems with the capacity to produce energy and heat out of other measures  the hydroelectric capacity proposed to be installed in this scenario considers the cambambe 2 project  finally composting the capacity to send 500 ton/day of waste for composting was considered  for biomass solar and wind were considered the same projects and also the same installed capacity  it also established the global goal of enhancing adaptive capacity strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate change article 7  in addition to outlining conditional and unconditional mitigation contributions and the ndc will contribute to the global target of adaptation reducing vulnerability strengthening resilience and increasing the countrys adaptive capacity in order to protect ecosystems people livelihoods and strategic sustainable development and economic investment taking into account the urgent and immediate needs of the country based on the best science available and national context  angola has a great potential for fishing capacity particularly along its coastline due to the resources it contains which is relevant to the universe of flora and fauna in the country  the first support center is under construction since january 2017 in the salinas community on the coast of the city of sumbe cuanza sul  coastal zonethe coastline is an area with great potential and of relevance to the country due to its fishing capacity the natural resources it contains and its potential for tourism and recreation relevant to the universe of flora and fauna and the resulting benefits for society 56m in 2090 compared to the years 1980-1999 affecting densely populated areas such as the areas closest to the ocean and the city of luanda  the sustainable use of forests and related agroforestry products is hampered by the lack of adequate legal instruments and limited management capacity  in addition the climchangeadapt action plan in africa for the health sector 20122016 6 prioritizes the identification of risks to human health resulting from extreme climate effects as well as the strengthening of the health systems of the signatory countries including angola with a view to strengthening the national capacity to prevent and respond to threats to human health  damaged roads and bridges leads to the isolation of communities difficulties in accessing health and medical emergency services and may even compromise the evacuation routes of the village in the face of smells impeding access to schools workplaces shops and markets they interrupt the traffic of goods leading to a loss of productive capacity and can lead to increased costs for establishing alternative transport routes  to achieve this inequalities in service provision that disproportionately expose vulnerable groups to climate threats or restrict their capacity to respond effectively need to be addressed first  further wash contributions to community resilience can be achieved through creating systems that connect communities with local authorities in order to enable their integration into response plans capacity development and by fostering income generation as well as food energy and ecosystem resilience finally angola needs to work towards a low-carbon wash sector by improving water and energy efficiency and ensuring where possible the use of renewable energy for water and sanitation operations to lower greenhouse gas ghg emissions and energy generation from waste unconditional contributionstable 13 - adaptation measures unconditionalsector unconditional contributions

impediment to national research and development efforts as well as to human and institutional capacity  at the national level angola has been experiencing a sharp slowdown in its economic growth for some years motivated by the drop in oil production with a negative impact on the internal capacity to finance all of its economic activity  the ministerial department responsible for the environment

system at different levels  industrial development population growth and high growth rates in cities will continue leading to an increase of waste production in angola  in addition the mechanisms and technical capacities available for climate monitoring are insufficient to support the realization of long-term climate projections  this challenge facing climate change is compounded in coastal areas and cities that are subject to pressure resulting from demographic and economic concentration for which they are not yet fully prepared  many developing countries will require enhanced capacities to

created the national commission on climate change and biodiversity cnacb with a more specific mandate for climate change and more executive and political harmonization composed of several entities such as the ministry petroleum transport higher education science and technology health and agriculture and fisheries under the coordination of the ministerial department responsible for the environment  in 2018 the unemployment rate was estimated at 28 and remained predominantly high among youth in urban areas 3834 9 children per woman on average in 2010-201519  contributing to the population growth tendency is the declining of mortality in the country in recent years as a reflection of the increase of life expectancy at birth decrease of juvenile mortality rates and lower vih prevalence in pregnant women despite existence of some provincial variation15 6 years for men and 63 for women although the country aims to belong to the human development index high score countries

include climate change content in university programs train citizens who are aware and aware of the urgency to act on the effects of climate change  at the same time the creation of support centers for artisanal fisheries was recently announced with a view to supporting fishing activities by local communities in particular seeking to improve the income of fishing communities increasing revenues

consumption by energy source for the year 2009 and 2016 electric generation has been historically met almost exclusively by hydropower plants with a total installed power capacity of 2011 mw at the end of 2016  the country has exploited approximately 50 of its hydropower potential and future expansion of hydropower capacity is possible mainly along the drini mati devolli and bistrica rivers  although technically not a coastal city tirana is sometimes considered as such given its proximity to the coastline and the functional links with coastal city of durres which constitutes the main port of the country  the main negative factors are a lack of forest management capacity illegal logging and forest fires  the grazing intensity has a definite influence on the sustainability of grazing depending on carrying capacity and pasture conditions  they will also damage supporting infrastructure such as airports roads and ports as well as the capacity to provide consistent energy and quality

agenda and the aarhus convention on access to information public participation in decision-making and access to justice in environmental matters through participatory processes including a strong engagement of youth  in addition to direct physical and mental health consequences from floods water-borne and vector-borne diseases like salmonellosis leishmaniasis and leptospirosis to which infants and children are the most vulnerable  the total full-time employment in the fisheries and aquaculture sector is estimated at more than 4200 persons with a significant number of women employed by the processing industry and ancillary services  gender distribution gaps and structural barriers women and men are legally equal under albanian law and its gender development index gdi in 2019 was high 0 64 however this is not sufficient to ensure gender equality as women face many obstacles in enjoying their equal rights including they have a more limited access to assets which translates into an inferior economic position  this gap encompasses salaries property ownership pensions inheritance and land more women are employed in the informal sector or at lower-paying jobs they are underrepresented among owners of important companies in technical sectors such as energy and transport they usually do not own land even though they constitute the majority of the agricultural workforce their representation in parliament is low 28 which is representative of their difficulty in taking part in decision-making processes  main gender differentiated vulnerabilities to climate change currently available analysis on how climate change affects men and women differently in albania is limited and focuses on the agsect  the different vulnerabilities in this sector depend to a large extent on the differentiated roles of women and men in the agricultural value chain  according to a survey conducted for the fourth national communication 4nc 39 of respondents believe there are differences in mens and womens ability to react to climate change and among them 53 believe men are more able to address climate change challenges 66 lives following the 2015 floods in the southeast of the country un women documented the following consequences of floods on women increase of the workload by four hours on average to clean up and due to lack of energy supply increase in violence against women both domestic and outside the home with women heads of households facing a greater risk decreased income loss of access to services that helped alleviate womens workload e 67 the increase in violence against women and that of time use for main household chores were also identified as the main impacts of climate change on womens living conditions in the fnc survey 69 health according to the 4nc survey women reported a more significant increase in health physical and emotional problems than men following climate-related disasters  exposure to high temperatures has adverse effects on pregnant women teratogenic effect  pregnant women are disproportionately more affected by healthcare access disruption following a disaster  according to un women it is very likely that energy supply use and consumption affect men and women differently and intersects with factors such as location age and financial status  energy is considered to be a male topic but household management is a women responsibility 70 energy poverty may thus be worsened by climate change as it affects energy consumption means of heating health and overall quality of life including during

the broadest sense and in all kinds of aspects in the social environmental and economic spheres  by 2050 the level of reduction will be sufficient for ghg emissions to be balanced with the absorptions of these gases either through national sink capacity or other capture storage or compensation measures through national mechanisms or international based on the market reaching an approximate value of 140 gg co2 eq  agriculture forestry and land use sector it is expected to maintain at least the sink capacity of the countrys forest mass in 2017 quantified in -139 gg co2 eq  for this it is important to have a good quantification of the sump capacity of our forests as a vitally important nature-based solution which is why we have improved our ghg inventory based on an analysis of land uses through the collection and evaluation of satellite images  agriculture forestry and land use sector around 23 of emissions are absorbed by the forest mass of the territory so that an improvement in silvicultural management that incorporates nature-based solutions must allow not only the scenario foreseen in the medium term that is to say that at least the sink capacity of the countrys forest mass of the year 2017 quantified in -139 gg co2 eq  annual will be maintained but that the ambition regarding the sink capacity of the forests of the country  likewise mitigation actions also include actions on the sector that provides the countrys sink capacity to absorb ghgs which is the agriculture forestry and other land use sectors  afolu sector ghg emissions related to the agriculture and livestock subsector have been maintained since 2000 an increase in the agricultural area is not foreseen and the capacity of cattle is also at the maximum of its value according to the area and type of livestock of the country which is extensive while the ghg sink capacity by the forest mass of the land use sector is considered constant and equal to the average of the estimated ghg absorption capacity for the period 1990-2011  these measures take into account natures ecosystem services and incorporate nature- based solutions to increase the resilience of the territory especially for the improvement of sink capacity and the management and minimization of risks related to the effects of climate change in a mountain territory like andorra infrastructures necessary for the transport of

voluntary market carbon and implementing actions adaptive forestry prioritizing based measures nature  the thermal demand of local administrations should be covered primarily by biomass which develops adaptive forestry projects that improve the yield of forest sump capacity  a reduction in ghg emissions that reaches the value of the countrys sink capacity approximately from 600 gg co2 eq to 140 gg co2 eq represents a 77 reduction in ghg emissions over a 32-year period 2018-2050 so that the average annual reduction is 2  fair and ambitious commitment the parties commitment is consistent with

adaptation measures identified and prioritized in the paacc 2014 to ensure that the adaptation measures are coherent and adapt to the real and anticipated changes in the territory the study of the impact and vulnerability in relation to climate change continues and law 21/2018 of september 13 on boosting the energy transition and climate change considers that the priority themes are health agriculture energy and tourism  these measures take into account natures ecosystem services and incorporate nature- based solutions to increase the resilience of the territory especially for the improvement of sink capacity and the management and minimization of risks related to the effects of climate change in a mountain territory like andorra  likewise the improvement of the knowledge of our natural environment and its operation leads us to the consolidation of a management model of the natural and rural territory that allows us to improve the countrys resilience through measures

the protection of citizens involves generating territorial equity a fair distribution of costs and a quality and guarantee of services especially energy  the actions included in the strategy are directed at specific sectors such as energy mobility agriculture and waste management among others as well as different sectors to address more cross-cutting issues such as the promotion of the circular economy changes in our consumption habits the application of solutions based on nature the promotion of research in these areas and the inclusion of new concepts in the education of all

levels and will be accompanied with adequate policies to ensure sustainable and socially inclusive growth for all citizens particularly women  our climate action plans are focused on building the entrepreneurial capacity of women youth and msmes  this ndc will cover the period 2020 to 2030 and it includes targets for mitigation and adaptation as well as targets that are designed to reduce transitional risks support vulnerable groups including women the elderly and people living with disabilities support an inclusive gender responsive approach to the energy transition with special focus on women fully participating in the new economy and providing support for men working within the power and transportation sectors as the transition advances support youth fully with a gender

micro small and medium enterprises msmes and businesses in the informal sector  this approach also recognizes the transitional risks that may result from implementing an inclusive energy transition considering that the roles and hopes of men women and youth are different thus the process should ensure differences are respected and supported to ensure that no one is left behind 1 gender addressing the gender dimension of climate change is a priority in antigua and barbuda due to the gender differentiated impacts and vulnerabilities experienced by women and men associated to climate change and their gender differentiated contributions to mitigation and adaptation actions and climate resilience  the goab has conducted baseline gender assessments to identify multiple cases of vulnerability to climate change among men and women as well as identifying the differential adaptive capacity to climate change  the overall outcome is to ensure that projects and programmes are gender responsive meaning that it aims to go beyond gender sensitivity to actively promote gender equality and womens empowerment  the country is committed to achieving sdg 5 gender equality by promoting low carbon development where men and women contributions to climate change mitigation and adaptation are recognized and valued existing gender inequalities are reduced and opportunities for effective empowerment for women are promoted  to achieve this objective antigua and barbuda will recognize and integrate the different and complementary roles of men and women into policies and strategies on climate change and will ensure that the implementation of the ndc will be gender responsive  this approach will ensure that the ndc implementation a recognizes and acknowledges gender norms and inequalities and responds to them by creating actions policies and initiatives to address the different needs constraints and opportunities of women and men and b ensures that women and mens differential needs are addressed that participation of women and men is equitable and that distribution of benefits resources status and rights are equitably attended  as links between climate impacts energy access and gender are critical therefore antigua and barbuda recognizes the gendered aspect of energy poverty and how it disproportionately affects women and girls  this strategy will recognize and acknowledge among other things the gender norms and inequalities prevalent in the energysect women and mens differentiated access to energy their different energy needs and preferences and different impacts that energy access could have on their livelihoods  20000 homes 20 increase in the number of women-led businesses implementing renewable energy and adaptation interventions 100 of

intently on enabling access to energy efficiency and renewable energy for the most vulnerable particularly women who are most affected when electric is not available since the grid is down after an extreme weather event  the system will promote the collection of sex and age disaggregated data and focus on ensuring that there is sufficient information available for all social/gender groups

to an agreement to act jointly under article 4 of the paris agreement  the covid-19 crisis has underlined the importance of maintaining the capacity of the government to respond to crises and protect its people  the 14-point programme which tellingly remains relevant over two decades later identified the following priority areas for the sustainable development of sids climate change and sea- level rise natural and environmental disasters management of wastes coastal and marine resources freshwaterresources energy resources tourism resources biodiversity resources national institutions and administrative capacity regional institutions and technical cooperation transport and communication science and technology and human resource development &rdquo the 2030 agenda for sustainable development presents an opportunity for sids to optimize the potential benefits of implementing the 17 sdgs and enhance the capacity of national frameworks to guide coherent policy design and integrated cross-sectoral implementation of development objectives  in light of this the agenda of the sdgs and the aspirations of sids must be synergized through institutional strengthening to assist with strengthening both the national and sub-regional capacity for collection analysis and dissemination of disaggregated data to facilitate evidence-based decision-making and ensure effective monitoring and measurement of the attained national development goals so that the well-being and livelihoods of persons are sustained and enriched  it addresses scarcity and irreplaceable resources including through the shift from car-centric transportation to multi-modal mobility  its objectives are to make low- and middle-income homes more resilient to extreme weather events and their impacts such as possible loss of access to electric and potable water distribution systems to increase freshwater storage capacity and wateruse efficiency and reduce emissions through the deployment of distributed renewable energy generation to decrease land-based sources of marine pollution through more sustainable land use practices to make critical utility water and sanitation and road infrastructure climate resilient and to restore vulnerable coral reef ecosystems particularly on the west and south coasts of the island  installation of augmented disaster-resilient storage capacity for potable water at homes will further increase resilience  this includes the financial protection mechanism for contingent liabilities from natural hazard-induced disaster shocks system of annual stress testing of insurance firms of their capacity to absorb natural and man-made disasters and development of the appropriate measures to address identified weaknesses  key vulnerabilities and risks environmental risks barbados faces the adverse effects of climate change and natural hazards with their attendant economic and social challenges including unsustainable debt levels arising in part from extreme weather events and slow onset events impacting national income flows increasing indebtedness and impairing repayment capacity  however climate change vulnerability also affects all other key sectors of the economy agriculture waterresources human health and settlements coastal resources fisheries and insurance while adaptation requires economy-wide and sector-specific efforts to alleviate impacts and reinforce adaptive capacity of vulnerable key sectors  building resilience and adaptation capacity have now become fully integrated in the development of all government policies in particular the 2021 pdp update and r2rp which in turn are closely related to sectoral policies in priority sectors identified in the 2015 ndc such as coastal zone management and waterresources  the shared objectives of strengthening resilience building adaptive capacity and reducing vulnerability to climate change and disasters represent a strong rationale for alignment of the country&rsquos efforts under the 2030 agenda for sustainable development the paris agreement and the sendai framework for disaster risk reduction drr  for this three different types of capacity need to be strengthened absorptive capacity enabling barbados to prepare for and overcome climate shocks adaptive capacity adjusting to a warming world in anticipation of shocks and transformative capacity the ability to mitigate the impacts of shocks through a transformation of social and economic systems  responses to vulnerabilities and risks the limits to adaptive capacity are already being reached and risk response mechanisms are proving insufficient 5 mw in solar/gas microturbine capacity  the roofs 2 reefs programme has been specifically designed to strengthen resilience and adaptation capacity as well as make a mitigation contribution  barbados faces real constraints in human capacity to cope with climate change and other systemic shocks  this is only in part due to limited capacity  its objectives are to make low- and middle-income homes more resilient to extreme weather events and their impacts such as possible loss of access to electric and potable water distribution systems to increase freshwater storage capacity and wateruse efficiency and reduce emissions through the deployment of distributed renewable energy generation to decrease land-based sources of marine pollution through more sustainable land use practices to make critical utility water and sanitation and road infrastructure climate resilient and to restore vulnerable coral reef ecosystems particularly on the west and south coasts of the island  barbados faces real constraints in human capacity to cope with climate change and other systemic shocks  the capacitbuilding initiative for transparency cbit project under development by the government with idb&acutes support will seek to strengthen barbados technical and institutional capacity to meet the requirement of article 13 of the paris agreement on climate change  it is however clear that there is a need to build further capacity to meet the enhanced international requirements of transparency  this project will allow barbados to receive resources to address data issues build capacity for the development and update of greenhouse inventories establish a robust mrv systems enhance collaboration between ministries agencies and the privatesect and improve knowledge in transparency and the paris agreement  this is only in part due to limited capacity  indeed the 2030 agenda for sustainable development recognizes that each country has different realities capacities and levels of development and faces its own specific challenges to achieve sustainable development  the 2030 agenda for sustainable development requires a new strategic approach that strengthens trust in international cooperation encourages a collective action for the provision of global and regional public goods increases resilience to the lack of appropriate finance trade and technological shocks protect the rights of minorities and strengthens the interests of the majority over the interests of groups that are organized and can contribute capital and technology to strengthen capacities  the effect of these three shocks has strained the people&rsquos capacities and resources to adapt to the further climate impacts that will inevitably follow  barbados&rsquo approach to achieving such alignment is determined by the particular country&rsquos context and capacities  barbados has adopted this guidance within its capacities c barbadoss

measures  other policies and programmes in addition to general legislation for the adaptation of the territory and the economy to climate change barbados has developed a number of legislative proposals to protect some of its most important sectors  in recent times barbados has had to manage the impacts suffered from the synergies between three different crises 1 the climate crisis which the people of barbados have already seen impact on the territory 2 the covid-19 crisis which has heavily impacted the society and economy and 3 the volcanic ash crisis following the eruption of la soufriere in neighbouring st  consequently barbados needs to focus its resources not only on mitigation but also on adaptation and resilience to protect its territory 1 the bpoa for the sustainable development of sids 1994 was a recognition by the un general assembly of the common challenges faced by sids a narrow resource base depriving sids of the benefits of economies of scale small domestic markets and heavy dependence on a few external and remote markets high costs for energy infrastructure transportation communication and servicing long distances from export markets and import resources low and irregular international traffic volumes little resilience to natural disasters growing populations high volatility of economic growth limited opportunities for the privatesect and a proportionately large reliance of their economies on their public sector and fragile natural environments  the 2021 pdp will guide future development in barbados with respect to land use settlement patterns food production infrastructure mobility and environmental management and informs the public and privatesects as to the nature scope and location of both development and protection areas for

will impact already vulnerable groups disproportionately including youth and women as well as lower income communities  the situation is exacerbated by declining foreign direct investment fdi flows high unemployment especially among youth and as mentioned slow economic growth  the education sector was particularly challenged due to the lack of appropriate broadband infrastructure in the

thanking the valuable work of so many specialists public entities and civil society organizations international partners and friendly countries whose contributions allowed us to update our nationally determined contribution ndc in the context of the paris agreement in perfect alignment with the sustainable development policies and strategies of our small island and archipelagic state  due to the smallness and weaknesses of its economy it is also characterized by the weak capacity to replace the damage caused by catastrophes resulting from extreme weather and climatic events  although cabo verdes population compares well with other countries in africa in terms of access to energy water and education the pandemic has shown that economic and health emergencies are exacerbated by the triple crisis of resources scarcity climate change and biodiversity loss particularly for cabo verdes rural society  while mobilising substantial domestic funding cabo verde will rely on international support technological capacity-building and finance to achieve its 2030 contributions  cabo verde is also facing significant capacity constraints limited fiscal space and insufficient domestic finance to respond adequately to challenges posed by climate change  as a consequence the archipelgo faces severe adaptation challenges associated with among others waterresource scarcity food and energy security  local food production continued food imports for more than 80 of their needs cabo verdeans are dependent on imports of essential food any disruptions for shipping commodity supply fluctuating international food commodity prices and currency risks will have disproportionate consequences for cabo verdes food security and distribution and the capacity to meet basic needs energy fossil fuel imports and logistics while cabo verde is dependent on imports for virtually all its fossil fuel needs the energy mix still heavily relies on them from transport to desalination to generator use whether in agriculture or in the health hospital system disruptions to supply and prices a likely prospect in a world more and more impacted by climate change and vanishing resources are felt immediately and across communities  linking cabo verdes islands with each other and with other countries a challenge at the best of times is extremely vulnerable to disruptions from climate change pandemics fossil fuel scarcity  building resiliencecabo verde follows the ipcc definition describing resilience as the ability of a social or ecological system to absorb disturbances while

according to the unfccc and the generation of data within the institutions key  regarding m&ampe the country began its efforts to standardize a monitoring system to quantify adaptation measures in conjunction with mitigation measures and to strengthen the inter-institutional commitment to transparency  in particular the national statistics office one needs to strengthen its human and institutional resources to control the quality of the data based on the ipcc guidelines and methodologies for calculating ghg emissions  these identified needs will ensure the quality of ghg emissions data by sector with institutional strengthening through institutional arrangements for the establishment of processes and for the correct identification of adaptation and mitigation actions to be reflected in the biennial reports of transparency and national communications  technical and institutional capacity gaps and needs have been identified in areas such as greenhouse gas emissions accounting research and systematic observation data collection risk modeling and vulnerability assessments human and institutional capacities for the development of project proposals for the different sources of climate funds  lack of human resources in key institutions as well as rigorous guidelines and requirements delay the implementation of concrete mitigation and adaptation actions  another project for the creation of capacities in the planning stage is the project developing capacities to advance in the process of the national adaptation plan in the dominican republic which will train the technical personnel of the pertinent government institutions in the use of these guidelines at the national and local  with the recently enacted environmental education and communication law the

strengthen institutional capacities for the inclusion of the youth approach in the design and implementation of plans policies and programs related to the preservation of natural resources and the mitigation and adaptation to the effects of climate change c  this guide is the result of a process of national consultations with various institutional and civil society actors including representatives of local governments central government and international cooperation under the coordination of the ministry of economy planning and development  climate change is one of the most important and urgent challenges facing humanity in the 21st century whose impacts endanger the institutional economic social and environmental development of developing countries particularly small island states such as the dominican republic whose vulnerabilities to extreme weather events have been accentuated in recent decades  in terms of human rights the following stand out the first strategic axis proposes the formation of a social and democratic state of law with institutions that act ethically transparently and efficiently at the service of a responsible and participatory society which guarantees security and promotes equity governability coexistence peaceful and national and local development  to address these challenges all countries need strong cross-cutting institutions that support effective action in specific sectors eg energy transport agriculture etc  strong national institutions also support a countrys commitment to international action against climate change  in this context the dominican republic places great emphasis on strengthening its domestic governance system as well as the capacities of its key institutions to enable the effective implementation of its decarbonization and adaptation objectives as established in the ndc  since the adoption of the paris agreement in 2015 the dominican republic has made progress in developing its regulatory and institutional framework  the beginnings of climate governance in the dominican republic began with the creation of the national council for climate change and clean development mechanism under decree 601-08 september 2008 as the entity for inter-institutional coordination and formulation of public policy on climate change cross-cutting at the national level between multisectoral and stakeholders  goals the dominican republic is currently working on comprehensive climate change legislation that will enact key features of the national climate governance system including far-reaching institutional reforms that strengthen existing bodies  the main elements that will be worked on in the bill aremitigation and adaptation goals in accordance with the ndc processes to ensure risk management independent expert assessment and advice mechanism clarification of roles and inter-institutional coordinationparticipation of subnational actors financing for implementationpublic participation transparency and accountability through the application of the national mrv system and other instruments  additionally the efforts towards the implementation of the transparency framework seek to integrate the transparency system into the institutional qualification system of public administration in order to supervise institutions that fulfill their role within the mrv system  goals during the first meeting of the plenary session of the national council for climate change the president of the dominican republic emphasized the inter-institutional planning mandate to mainstream climate change policy and execute climate action which complies with the ndc  to land this coordination from the central government to the sectorial ones it is proposed to develop institutional strategic plans that consider how they contribute to climate action  these plans must achieve clarify and close gaps in the roles of institutions and strengthen inter-institutional coordination including through the climate change law develop mechanisms to ensure that sector strategies are implemented by institutions within each sector eg practical guides and guidelines and other incentives create a follow-up mechanism in which the ndc is referenced in the review of the presidential goals consider presidential goal measures to determine their contribution to the ndc  goals the country will coordinate institutional strengthening the delimitation of priority topics for research and enable the participation of researchers through competitions  strengthen the evidence base on climate change for example a third party to institutional strengthening delimitation of priority topics for research participation of researchers through contests  institutional architecture for financing for executionthe mrv system establishes through the support and financing registry the institutional architecture to track the financing and support required to implement

the urgent need to carry out a new forest inventory to accurately assess the current sequestration capacity of guinean forests but also to carry out an in-depth study of the vectors of deforestation  this progress should further accelerate significantly with the recent commissioning of the souapiti dam whose capacity of 450 megawatts mw will ultimately almost double the installed electrical power

preferential conditions concessional because the additional debt capacity remains low despite this growth and the structural reforms undertaken to increase own budgetary resources  in addition they are more vulnerable to the vagaries of climate change due to fewer and more volatile resources which constrain their adaptive capacity  to this end the republic of guinea requires the support of the international community to strengthen its capacities paris agreement art  beyond the fact that this increase in gdp is likely to strengthen capacities in general adaptation gender mainstreaming in the adaptation and mitigation measures of the ndc is a priority given the tasks generally assigned to women in the household their over-representation in the sectors most affected by climate change agriculture livestock and fisheries but also their low representation in decision-making bodies  the mitigation and adaptation measures of the cdn are all likely to improve the adaptation capacities and resilience of women and vulnerable populations in guinea as a priority  the development of alumina refinement and aluminum smelting are therefore likely to very strongly increase the countrys electric demand and co2 emissions if the capacities are not installed through renewable energies  so far solid waste has not been treated in the country including in the largest cities generating a significant shortfall in terms of health the environment and the economy  this trajectory assumes that 90 of new capacities must be of renewable origin and that thermal production reaches its peak between 2025 and 2030 and that the yields of electric production in relation to the situation of reference be increased by 50 se4all  by 2030 this objective requires the installation of approximately 2500 mw of renewable production all sources combined 21 to absorb the demand for electric without increasing new thermal capacities  in parallel with the installation of new capacities improvement of the electric network whose losses amounted to 42 in 2018  combined with biogas the dissemination of this modern cooking method targets national capacities of 40 ktep in 2030  this represents 128k lpg stoves with capacities of 13  development of energy-intensive activities conditional on the parallel development of rapidly developing renewable electric capacities at the national level and connection to the main grid  this development of electrical capacities should allow a 10 reduction in carbon intensity per tonne of ore by 2025 and 30 by 2030 which represents the connection to the main electric network of around 10 of the installations  all of the above measures would represent a total of 1740 ktco2 eq / year avoided in 2030 compared to the bau scenario conditional objective the support of the tfps should make it possible to accelerate the joint development of electrical capacities for mining activities and connection to the main network  so far solid waste has not been

therefore necessary to strengthen the privatesects commitment to finance and invest in the fight against climate change  the republic of guinea is already well organized and equipped in terms of mobilizing the privatesect through the actions of its ministry in charge of investments and public-private partnerships 23 several sectors of opportunity mentioned by the ministry are closely linked to the actions integrated into the cdn energy & hydraulics agriculture meteorological infrastructures etc  the strengthening of this privatesect commitment is based on i the definition of a detailed

new climate regime in 2016 guinea-bissau has committed to participating in global efforts to reduce its greenhouse gas ghg emissions and to strengthen its resilience and capacity to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change  there may be scarcity of water noting that a good part of the coast already suffers from aridity  poverty peoples low financial capacity low capacity for energy production and the countrys low level of electrification are mentioned  there are also signs that the national capacity to absorb climate finance has limitations  the implementation of these measures is divided between national effort and international support according to the technical and financial capacity of national actors which makes it possible to distinguish the conditional and unconditional emissions trajectory as shown in the following graph figure 3 trajectories of baseline and ndc scenario emissions of guinea-bissau the carbon intensity of the country slows down from 10 tco2é/1000 usd 2010 in 2020 to 6  the ndc in energysect expects in particular the implementation of the following measures the set-up of an installed renewable energy capacity of around 90 mw by 2030 compared to 3 mw currently  strengthen the existing capacity to develop a redd+ programme  this objective corresponds to the highest possible level of ambition for guinea-bissau given its level of development low economic resources and the limitation of its implementation capacity over the short period 2021-2030  such a response should aim at different measures in the following areas 1 strengthening adaptive capacity strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate change 2 funding gaps for adaptation sectors and segments the following priority sectors as identified in guinea-bissaus official documents for the unfccc are without adequate funding for adaptation and should be prioritized through new programs and initiatives fisheries & ocean ecosystems energy waterresources human health capacity development disaster risk management  capacity to implement gender adaptation is still limited in guinea-bissau  as a cross-cutting theme it is also important to consider the challenges in the areas of technical development and education such as weak technical capacities to operationalize actions that respond to climate adaptation issues ensuring good planning and budget adequacy lack of strong underlying data to serve as base for detailed achievable and verifiable climate adaptation response targets and weak national capacity for climate change education research and training particularly regarding risk identification vulnerability and adaptation measures 2 significant funding gaps have been identified in fisheries and ocean ecosystems energy waterresources human health capacity development disaster risk management infrastructure roads bridges houses etc  more basic efforts to strengthen institutions and expand these capacities need to be

tonnes/day agriculture the ghg emissions of agriculture and forestry activities in the year 2012 accounted for around 1 of jordans total emissions  the following are examples of emerging mitigation measures to be explored quantified and proposed in the future ndc update cycles in various sectors as follows renewable energy storage the acceleration of re production in jordan reaching a share of 13 of electric production in 2019 and the series of new re projects that are being either constructed or planned pushes the re capacity to a close to saturation of the grid according to the perspective of the ministry of energy and mineral resources  urban systems adopting a compact city planning approach e  jordan is expected to finalize its fourth national communication fnc exercise in 2022 the government has adopted in 2021 the national adaptation plan nap which consolidate the countrys vision on adaptation supported by the prioritized adaptation actions that link the economic sectors and country level vulnerabilities to enhance long- term resilience and adaptive capacity with consideration for gender and the needs for the most vulnerable groups  the following pages provides a description of key strategic objectives for increasing adaptive capacity and resilience to climate change impacts in jordan that should be implemented using national and international resources  the increased scarcity of waterresources due to lower rainfall increased demand and structural challenges lead to an increased gap between available waterresources threated under climate change conditions and ever-increasing demand from various development sector  enhancing water storage capacity in natural dams and water retention systems 3 improving adaptive capacity of water utilities water utilities wastewater treatment plants water desalination plants and water distribution utilities constitute major elements of the waterresource management scope in jordan and enhancing their effective performance and resilience to climate change impacts is a priority for strengthening the adaptive capacity of the whole sector  enhancing performance and efficiency of water utilities through technological improvements and capacity development for reducing water loss 4 improved efficiency in wateruse for sustainable development in a future where climate change will multiply the expected scarcity of waterresources in jordan due to increased population growth and economic development it becomes essential that watereffic measures become a necessary approach in watermanage to enhance climate resilience and improve productivity of wateruse  enhancing the use of watereffic technology at household and business levels in urban and rural settings enhancing the adaptive capacity of small farmers in jordan valley through wateruser associations for increasing use of reclaimed water for irrigation purposes  it constitutes mainly any strategic interventions to enhance the adaptive capacity of the sector  it is vital to enhance the effectiveness of irrigation systems in jordan through various interventions at policy and practice levels including water harvesting improving soil water storage capacity use of supplementary irrigation reduce soil erosion through community management use of ecosystem based adaptation eba  key suggested measures include introduce and diversify crops with low water requirements and high productivity in addition to capacity withstanding in drought saline and heat conditions modification of crops planting and harvesting dates through the production and promoting an agro-climatic calendar 4 3 enhancing the adaptive capacity of ecosystem services against extreme and long term climate change impacts modern management tools for sustainable use and planning for ecosystems requires the use of ecosystem services approach 2 enhancing the adaptive capacity of the health sector under current and future climate change conditions it is a high priority for the health sector in jordan to complement the national efforts to strengthen the capacity of the health sector to address the impacts of covid-19 with additional knowledge and capacity to contain the current and expected health impacts resulting from climate change either through extreme weather impacts or the possibility of spreading of climate related infectious diseases  key measures include establishing an early warning system to trigger prompt public health intervention when certain variables exceed a defined threshold building the capacity of public health and health care professionals to monitor diagnose and treat cases of climate-sensitive health outcomes even when they change their incidence seasonality and geographic range 4  mandating urban municipalities to lead community based initiatives for responding to climate risks through institutional restructuring and capacity development  key proposed measures include conduct site-specific research on the carrying capacity for critical and marine protected area  key proposed measures include increase knowledge of factors determining resilience and adaptive capacity of the reef ecosystem to climate change  increase the capacity of reef managers to maximize reef resilience and adaptive capacity through application of research outcomes use of integrated coastal zone management iczm for enhancing resilience of marine ecosystems integrated coastal zone management iczm is the most effective management tool for coastal areas as it targets a holistic management scheme for all natural and built elements of coastal areas including impacts of climate change 1 enhancing the adaptive capacity of cultural heritage sites and infrastructure initiatives and studies to

sector increase and mobilize resources available for the implementation monitoring and enforcement of the nbsap 4  it is found that investing in adapting to and mitigating climate change has the potential to accelerate progress in many other sdgs with the available potential to work with public and private investors on aligning their business models and investments to the sdgs which will lead to more effective resource allocation and catalyze additional financing for national sdgs priorities  in order to address these challenges the government is working to develop instructions to be stemmed from the bylaw to enable the ministry of environment to supervise implement regulate and monitor the climate change actions at sectoral levels taking into account the legislative and executive mandates of the different national institutions  enabling factors for climate action jordan employs a framework of institutional and policy instruments in the planning and implementation of its climate actions that constitute the structural tool for the development and implementation of ndc within the context of the overall climate policy and action fields in the country 1 governance and institutional arrangements jordan succeeded in developing the first ndc in 2015 under the coordination of the ministry of environment being the chair of the national climate change committee  the ministry at that time adopted the participatory approach to convene the governmental institutions the privatesect and other non-state actors  the bylaw establishes the climate change institutional arrangement in jordan through the national climate change committee nccc being responsible for oversight and coordination 2 mainstreaming ndcs in national and local planning the effective implementation of ndcs is determined not only by the leading role of the ministry of environment but by ensuring an economy wide adoption of the ndc targets programmes and measures in sectoral plans implemented by all public private and civil institutions  the three municipalities had developed their local climate action plans lcaps based on the local relevant climate actions socio-economic analysis capacities assessment availability of plans staff availability institutional structure and data availability to define key indicators to cover both the mitigation and adaptation objectives 4 jordans sustainable development goals jordan adopted the 2030 agenda and developed a roadmap for sustainable development goals sdgs implementation mainstreaming the sdgs into national/sub- national planning budgetary and monitoring frameworks and institutional mechanisms put in place to achieve its commitment to leaving no one behind  and to avoid overlapping mechanisms during the implementation of 2030 agenda the government opted to build upon the existing institutional frameworks  17 of 2020 to be the legal reference and institutional framework for the privatesect investments and to enable future ppp projects in the country 1 integrating climate adaptation and resilience in policy and institutional reforms in the watersect the mwi and the watersect in general is undergoing a deep and effective institutional reform process that provides a perfect opportunity to introduce a structural approach for climate resilience at the legal policy and institutional levels at the ministry of water and irrigation and relevant public authorities responsible for waterresource management  promote desalination programmes for drinking water and irrigation promote rainwater harvesting in urban areas from rooftops and greywater reuse both at the institution level and at household level to support vulnerable households and communities encouraging water-substitution arrangements for decentralized wastewater treatment solutions at clusters and sub-district levels 4 1 integrating climate resilience in the policy and institutional reforms in agricultural sector effective improvement of the institutional and policy frameworks of the agricultural sectors is essential to address impacts of climate change  the main target of support should be the ministry of agriculture and its associated institutions like the national agricultural research center narc  this includes improving the institutional and technical capacities of public institutions mandated with drought detection and management in jordan to be able to provide early warning systems of incoming drought and enhancing readiness and responsiveness to drought events  key measures proposed in this strategic objective are update and identify key ecosystems that are highly sensitive to climate change establish a clear research design to target indicator species of fauna flora and ecosystems in order to better understand the climate effects and apply adaptation measures develop a recovery and restoration plans for highly threatened ecosystems and species of fauna and flora including the development of clear

available for the implementation monitoring and enforcement of the nbsap 4  the objective should mobilize related institutions and experts to conduct studies and observations of climate impacts on health in terms of changing climate conditions or the emergence of climate related infectious diseases in jordan  key measures under this objective are updating the climate change and health vulnerability and adaptation assessment v&ampa that was conducted in 2012 educating and informing the public of the needed measures to protect health from the adverse impacts of climate change developing climate-informed disease control programs and surveillance systems using meteorological services targeting climate-sensitive diseases introducing new indicators that are useful for protecting health such as air quality index uv index in cooperation with the relevant institutions developing new methods and tools for preparing for coping with and recovering from outbreaks of climate-sensitive diseases such as early warning systems based on environmental information carrying out a baseline assessment of greenhouse gas emissions of the health system or health care facilities including supply chains  it is of the highest priority to enhance institutional readiness of municipalities and community organization to anticipate and manage climate related disaster and risks especially in the form of floods in urban areas  there is a strategic need for enhancing institutional and coordination conditions to improved community participation in identification and addressing climate change impacts at community level in urban areas  mandating urban municipalities to lead community based initiatives for responding to climate risks through institutional restructuring and capacity development 1 enhancing the adaptive capacity of cultural heritage sites and infrastructure initiatives and studies to provide the required data and improve understanding of each heritage resource and its vulnerability to climate change to develop and mainstream sustainable policies and plans for climate-change adaptation of built and archeological heritage to develop and mainstream policies and plans for protection and climate-change adaptation of intangible cultural heritage and for the support of local communities whose livelihoods and wellbeing depend on cultural heritage resources to exploit the opportunities for built andu2028archaeological heritage and for intangible heritage to demonstrate value and secure resources to improve engagement and coordination among the various stakeholders in the field including government and nongovernmental organizations as well as international institutions  interactive community participation is a vital tool for supporting the following actions engagement of local community in planning and designing of local climchangeadapt plans community participatory approach enhance climate related basic services to rural and vulnerable communities to reduce the negative impact of expected climate change effects supporting the enhancement of adaptive capacities at local and community levels as a key step in enabling local institutions to allocate resources and knowledge in local adaptation programmes enhancing the functions and accuracy of early warning systems against floods droughts and other climate risks in poverty-stricken areas  jordan recognizes that both mitigation and adaptation are essential for building climate- resilient pathways and strengthening the co-benefits of the synergies will contribute to a better allocation of financial and institutional resources for the implementation of the ndc 1 illustrates the mrv system functions that serve the key stakeholders to measure and report their re and ee projects with various access levels according to their authority at the project institution sectoral and national level 1 capacitbuilding climate change is a cross cutting issue which requires building the capacities and the institutional frameworks to create the long-term commitment for public and privatesects civil society and communities in general  jordan considers ndc implementation as an opportunity for building the required skills knowledge and the institutional coordination mechanisms at different levels in various climate actions  and at the sectoral level for actions under waste and water for irrigation sectors the government is planning to enhance the implementation of climate actions through executing a variety of activities including but not limited to improving the stakeholders skills in preparing full proposals ready to be submitted to international climate-funds and assessing the level of engagement of the local privatesect and financial institutions in ndc implementation  to improve the institutional capacities between the line ministries to enforce the existing regulatory framework to enable monitoring the implementation of the ndcs  jordan committed to reduce the ghgs emissions by 5 by 2030 unconditionally therefore the country is focusing on strengthening the public financing institutions namely jordan renewable energy and energy efficiency fund jreeef and jordan environment fund jef to play a crucial role to co-financing local projects  jreeef now is active and has full and adequate institutional technical and financial capacity to manage the fund with a transparent and effective governance a strategic business plan and financial support windows  if it is mentioned in the adaptation component then it could be referred to 4 planning

accordance with article 4 paragraphs 16-18 of the paris agreement not applicable  about 20 of them are living in the camps while the rest are living in the urban areas of the country distributing between cities and towns benefiting from the available infrastructure and basic services delivered by the government and causing an extra stresses on the already limited natural-resources  the northern parts of aqaba are the most vulnerable regions for flashflood hazards since they are located downstream from areas of major wadis which discharge water into the gulf of aqaba and will affect areas that contain most of the town residential expansion 2 enhancing local adaptive capacity to climate change impacts through local climate action plans adaptation measures should start at the local level and then being scaled up to national levels at many areas of intervention especially while addressing vulnerability to climate change at the level of municipalities towns and villages  at the local levels the greater amman municipality gam has developed various climate change plans that aims at reducing ghg emissions and enhancing resilience  the first project targeted the large municipalities namely greater irbid municipality municipality of karak and the aqaba special economic zone authority aseza  the second project was implemented in 2019 in another three medium-sized municipalities namely municipality of deir alla north of jordan municipality of aloyoon middle and municipality of basseera south  promote desalination programmes for drinking water and irrigation

demands that it finds privatesect solutions to these challenges and that it incentivizes these solutions as part of its development model to build in resilience and economic growth  the national water strategy 2016- 2025 incorporates provisions for climate change water-energy-food nexus sustainability of overexploited groundwaterresources the adoption of new technologies including decentralized wastewatermanage and reuse of treated wastewater as well as commercialization and consolidation of wastewater services and increasing privatesect participation  the government have achieved a significant progress in the energy water agriculture education health industry privatesect engagement and youth and women as the most critical cross-cutting themes  the ministry at that time adopted the participatory approach to convene the governmental institutions the privatesect and other non-state actors 8 privatesect engagement jordan acknowledges the fundamental role of privatesect in achieving the economic social and environmental development  the plan addresses 19 areas of enabling environment including 23 privatesect investments among others  17 of 2020 to be the legal reference and institutional framework for the privatesect investments and to enable future ppp projects in the country  establishment of a green jobs council or similar body with a strong representation of privatesect and key public sector stakeholders could be explored  this could lead demand-side and supply-side assessments to identify gaps in jordanian ecosystem in terms of green technology and green entrepreneurship skills supporting and coordinating privatesect-led green technology skills development and national awareness activities 2  it is running mainly by the privatesect which is steering by the potential viability of the investment in climate interventions  currently a few privatesect companies are designing storage capacities with market based investments  while currently no quantification of the hydrogen potential in jordan is available several public and privatesect entities are in the process of providing such analyses which are expected to be available latest in the second quarter of 2022  key measures under this objective include restoration programmes of key sensitive habitats such as forests and coral reefs in the collaboration with ngos and local communities strengthen the role of privatesect in allocating their corporate social responsibility csr to support green infrastructure measures related to ecosystems and biodiversity adaptation activities gather compile document and analyze the traditional local knowledge on ecosystems and biodiversity in relation to climate forecasting to be used in developing participatory community-based green infrastructure adaptation programmes 4  other adaptation measures would add more co-benefits such as the ecosystem rehabilitation and restoration which aims at protecting ecosystem services through nature based solutions while providing job opportunities and strengthening the role of the privatesect in allocating their corporate social responsibility 1 capacitbuilding climate change is a cross cutting issue which requires building the capacities and the institutional frameworks to create the long-term commitment for public and privatesects civil society and communities in general  and at the sectoral level for actions under waste and water for irrigation sectors the government is planning to enhance the implementation of climate actions through executing a variety of activities including but not limited to improving the stakeholders skills in preparing full proposals ready to be submitted to international climate-funds and assessing the level of engagement of the local privatesect and financial institutions in ndc implementation  as part of the countrys drive to strengthen partnership with the privatesect the government has provided incentives to the privatesect to invest in infrastructure projects by establishing electric generation projects  stakeholder consultations were conducted through the working groups established by the bylaw comprising representatives from relevant sectoral agencies academia ngos and the privatesect in a gender-responsive manner  the committee which was established in 2002 following the announcement of mdgs and was expanded in 2017 to include broader government and civil society participation  using this approach is vital to enhance the adaptive capacities of ecosystems and habitats to climate change impacts based on the following measures develop a national plan for mitigating forests fires incidents including the identification of hazards training resources allocation awareness and knowledge raising and engagement of civil society organizations protect wetlands and major watershed areas vulnerable to climate change and enhance law enforcement measures establish protection measures to ensure minimizing extreme events effects on vulnerable ecosystems conceptual framework combining silvi-cultural ecological and community-based approaches for afforestation & honeybee foraging 4 1 capacitbuilding climate change is a cross cutting issue which requires building the capacities and the institutional frameworks to create the long-term commitment for public and privatesects civil society and communities in general  identification through science based evidence and in-depth social and environmental analysis of the current and potential impacts of climate change on most vulnerable groups in jordan including women children poor disabled and the unemployed  the breakdown of jordan population by age shows the structure of a youthful population as the age category of 0- 19 years old represents 44  the government have achieved a significant progress in the energy water agriculture education health industry privatesect engagement and youth and women as the most critical cross-cutting themes  unemployed with a huge increase of unemployment among jordanian youth and refugees the main priority for the economy is to generate new jobs 4 mobilization of social capital for climchangeadapt addressing climate change risks would never be successful without adequate and effective mobilization of all dimensions of social capital in jordan with special focus on youth  proposed actions under this objective include investing in youth as a future decision makers and key stakeholders that will contribute to adaptation to climate change through awareness and empowerment tools  some proposed actions are raising awareness and engagement through formal and informal education means in climate change environment and sustainable development in the community and among children and young people developing an enhanced unified common entry level education curriculum that includes new themes on climate change and environment raising climate and environmental awareness &gt contextualized materials for jordan to be disseminated through a social media b informal settlements c schools d youth centers and youth innovation incubators 5  therefore implementing the current ndc will not only reduce the national greenhouse gases but will also ensure the essential cross cutting themes of the sustainable development pathway of the country such as poverty reduction employment creation gender equality women empowerment and youth inclusion with the climchangeadapt and mitigation objectives  likewise to support the youth role to be able to engage in regional and international networks of the climate-dialogue for youth  some of the most vulnerable groups include children unicef has recently issued a landmark global climate risk index for children which uses data to generate new global evidence on how many children are currently exposed to climate and environmental hazards shocks and stresses  children sensitive climate planning should be a key element in the ndc implementation and future climate policy and programmes in jordan  some of the most vulnerable social groups to the impacts of climate change are poor women children disabled refugees and the unemployed  the following actions represent key areas of interventions improving the existing social protection system to cope with climate change consequences and serve jordanian segments of society including the poor orphans elderly abused women and children among other vulnerable groups and individuals adopting poverty fight programmes fostering providing housing for poor people and supporting micro-projects for poor communities in light of unusual severe seasonal cold and hot weather conditions prevailed in the last decade developing emergency relief and aid for areas and communities that are under threat of climate risks  identification through science based evidence and in-depth social and environmental analysis of the current and potential impacts of climate change on most vulnerable groups in jordan including women children poor disabled and the unemployed  some proposed actions are raising awareness and engagement through formal and informal education means in climate change environment and sustainable development in the community and among children and young people developing an enhanced unified common entry level education curriculum that includes new themes on climate change and environment raising climate and environmental awareness &gt contextualized materials for jordan to be disseminated through a social media b informal settlements c schools d youth centers and youth innovation incubators 5  the government have achieved a significant progress in the energy water agriculture education health industry privatesect engagement and youth and women as the most critical cross-cutting themes 9 gender mainstreaming in ndc implementation the inequitable distribution of resources decision making powers and services are disproportionately affecting womens role in climate response plan and in natural resources management in general especially in rural areas  promoting gender equality social justice inclusion and equal human rights entails a strategic shift in recognizing the differential circumstances among and between groups of women men girls and boys that calls for approaching priorities designing action planning implementation and monitoring progress in a more responsive and targeted manner  considering the magnitude of priorities that are on women organizations agenda it is essential that synergies are drawn to find the common grounds between gender equality women empowerment and climate change activists and practitioners to mitigate the long term impact of climate change on women and promote collaboration and cooperation  women are particularly disadvantaged as their access to information and knowledge are frequently constrained  nonetheless womens knowledge and coping mechanisms are at the core of adapting to climate change impact and or mitigating emissions acknowledging the different impact of climate change on women men girls and boys and the need for adopting gender-responsive solutions to improve the gender resilience to climate change jordan is currently pursuing to move forward with gender mainstreaming in climate change action by developing the national gender mainstreaming in climate change policy which encompasses the development of the framework for addressing the gender inequality and a strong local discourse on gender equality and climate change to advance progression towards achieving the national sustainable development goals  some of the most vulnerable social groups to the impacts of climate change are poor women children disabled refugees and the unemployed  the following actions

including women children poor disabled and the unemployed  therefore implementing the current ndc will not only reduce the national greenhouse gases but will also ensure the essential cross cutting themes of the sustainable development pathway of the country such as poverty reduction employment creation gender equality women empowerment and youth inclusion with the climchangeadapt and mitigation objectives  for instance the watersect measures that target the reuse of treated wastewater in agriculture contribute to adaptation goals of saving freshwaterresources and promoting the use of non-conventional waterresources to strengthen the adaptive capacity of the communities will secure positive impacts on the income of the rural communities and women workers in agriculture creating job opportunities along the supply chain in addition to the mitigation impact occurred with the wastewater treatment technologies  as a cross cutting issue concrete activities and pilot models for mainstreaming gender in climate-actions including eco-tourism solar energy watermanage and organic farming need to be implemented to advance the contribution of women in social innovation and adaptive actions 9 gender mainstreaming in ndc implementation the inequitable distribution of resources decision making powers and services are disproportionately affecting womens role in climate response plan and in natural resources management in general especially in rural areas  the national climate change policy 2013-2030 nccp the national adaptation plan nap and the third national communication report tnc all pledged to address gender inequalities through mainstreaming a gender perspective in relevant climchangeadapt and mitigation policies strategies and action  transformative change relies on translating the gender equality commitments to practical actions that address root causes of inequalities discrimination and imbalanced distribution of resources unequal power relations and marginalization  promoting gender equality social justice inclusion and equal human rights entails a strategic shift in recognizing the differential circumstances among and between groups of women men girls and boys that calls for approaching priorities designing action planning implementation and monitoring progress in a more responsive and targeted manner  considering the magnitude of priorities that are on women organizations agenda it is essential that synergies are drawn to find the common grounds between gender equality women empowerment and climate change activists and practitioners to mitigate the long term impact of climate change on women and promote collaboration and cooperation  nonetheless womens knowledge and coping mechanisms are at the core of adapting to climate change impact and or mitigating emissions acknowledging the different impact of climate change on women men girls and boys and the need for adopting gender-responsive solutions to improve the gender resilience to climate change jordan is currently pursuing to move forward with gender mainstreaming in climate change action by developing the national gender mainstreaming in climate change policy which encompasses the development of the framework for addressing the gender inequality and a strong local discourse on gender equality and climate change to advance progression towards achieving the national sustainable development goals  jordan is expected to finalize its fourth national communication fnc exercise in 2022 the government has adopted in 2021 the national adaptation plan nap which consolidate the countrys vision on adaptation supported by the prioritized adaptation actions that link the economic sectors and country level vulnerabilities to enhance long- term resilience and adaptive capacity with consideration for gender and the needs for the most vulnerable groups  therefore implementing the current ndc will not only reduce the national greenhouse gases but will also ensure the essential cross cutting themes of the sustainable development pathway of the country such as poverty reduction employment creation gender equality women empowerment and youth inclusion with the climchangeadapt and mitigation objectives  as a cross cutting issue concrete activities and pilot models for mainstreaming gender in climate-actions including eco-tourism solar energy watermanage

often underrepresented in climate change decision-making at all levels  it is necessary to consider the role of women in the development of policies not only as recipient of policy but also as important agents of its development and implementation  women are often a key part of communities families and local economies  as a result it is women who primary feel the destructive consequences of

climate change policy and implementation were not adequately analysed namely gender youth involvement and engagement with the privatesect  with regard to privatesect engagement public-private partnerships ppps are key to the industry waste and energysects  while the privatesect is less prevalent than in mitigation sectors there are strong opportunities especially for smallholder farmers

engagement  privatesect engagement overviewmost actions will be effective only through the engagement of the sector-appropriate privatesect players including through public private partnerships ppps  privatesect entry points have been identified with most of the ministries and engagement is highlighted in the ndc implementation through directed actions  privatesect partners will need to be engaged to develop ppps for climate solutions beyond a donor-based approach that can be applied sector-wide  some of the challenges and opportunities for ppps include23 an absence of reliable data on privatesect investments including difficulties in identifying adaptation measures supported by the privatesect and issues in covering all parts of the economy the size of the informal sector which accounts for more than half of cambodias gdp and small and medium sized enterprises smes make up the majority of businesses in cambodia only 0  through addressing some of these challenges and opportunities there is potential to accelerate climate action with the privatesect through ppps  mitigationin general all mitigation sectors require strong public and privatesect collaboration to ensure effectiveness  based on existing climate related data and information available the privatesect is predominantly involved in the industry waste and energysects while less information is available for other sectors namely transport forestry and agriculture  adaptationwhile the main potential to scale up private investments relate to mitigation efforts barriers can be removed in order to stimulate privatesect adaptation engagement not least in the agriculture human health and fisheries sectors24  in all sectors and crucially in buildings and infrastructure it is in the interest of the privatesect to be involved in policymaking and planning and to ensure guidelines and standards are appropriate and implementable  privatesect players are equally involved as input and technology providers such as in innovative and more resilient clean energy agriculture and water spaces as service providers such as in eco-tourism or technical assistance to sectors such as water or as financiers to many other actions or can themselves be involved in awareness training and education such as through private media and universities  in addition a privatesect event was organised with

agencies  gender overviewclimate change affects gender minorities disproportionately including women and girls  the areas where women play a central role - food security nutrition energy livelihoods health natural resource management among others - are those most directly impacted by climate change  by exaggerating gender inequality climate change also reinforces a structural root cause of violence against women and girls18  the ministry mandated with planning and facilitating the implementation of gender issues is the ministry of womens affairs mowa  the mowa has formed a gender and climate change committee which gathers information on gender and climate change conducts studies on the impact of climate change on women and children and builds climate change capacity in the ministrys departments  the mowa has also integrated climate change green growth and disaster risk management into neary rattanak iv the national policy on gender equality and womens empowerment  in addition as part of cambodias periodic reporting to the convention on ending all forms of discrimination against women cedaw the cambodia national council for women cncw responds specifically to the disproportionate impacts of climate change on rural women and acknowledges the policy and programme efforts underway in cambodia to mitigate these impacts19  as part of this ndc update all ministries acknowledged the importance of addressing gender issues particularly womens participation in climate action  most priority actions have a specific target for womens participation that ranges from 15 to 70  gender and age disaggregated data are crucially important in measuring the success of the gender targets not only related to womens participation but also womens access to skills and technology as well as women in climate-related decision making  in relation to energy priorities such as 1 access to energy in rural areas and 2 the diversification of household and community energy generation sources to reduce reliance on biomass as an energy source women are often responsible for household energyrelated decisions in rural areas and women the poor and the marginalised are often last to gain energy access  all mitigation sectors have encouraged the equal involvement of men and women in mitigation actions  however the waste and energysects show a higher tendency of maintaining a gender balance and encouraging womens participation  for example women and children often constitute a large portion of informal waste pickers  therefore formalising the wastesect management and creating decent jobs could have a significant impact on ensuring stable livelihoods for women  projects such as those in the composting market can benefit both men and women  women are also often responsible for the majority of household energy-related decisions in rural areas  in the transpsect women generally use public transport more than men  ensuring safe efficient and comfortable transport for women may increase their access to higher education centres skills development centres and other resources in urban areas  women constitute a higher proportion of the working population in agriculture and the forestsect is seen as providing strong opportunities to improve gender balance  in addition to continuing the enhancement of invited spaces for womens groups it will be important for gender outcomes to be adequately captured in the countrys redd+ safeguards information systems and the broader redd+ monitoring system  women 32  women have a strong role to play in this sector and in value chain development in particular  priorities include the need to increase womens income generation while decreasing their work burden by improving agricultural practices and access to technology as well as fostering womens collective working groups  in terms of infrastructure particularly in climate proofing of buildings and roads opportunities for women to contribute more prominently to restoration and construction are needed in order to increase their access to income and livelihoods  in the human health sector the importance of gender-disaggregated data is considered a priority especially to understand the different impacts of air-and vector-borne diseases on women and men  this is of particular significance to women who often carry the burden of household care including medical care for the family but who also play an important role in championing behavioural patterns which may improve health and hygiene and reduce disease spread22  in disaster risk management drm little gender-disaggregated data collection exists therefore information on the differentiated impacts of disasters on women the elderly children disabled people and other socially marginalised groups is largely anecdotal  data collection needs to be prioritised and the role of women in drm strengthened particularly in the potential role women and children can play a key role in developing and monitoring emergency response plans  enabling actionsit is crucial to develop training and awareness materials that take particular gender-based needs and priorities into account to ensure that women and girls benefit equally from climate action  the training of trainers and women champions are being rolled out in an effort to reach women in particular and this work will be continued and scaled up where possible  strong engagement continued throughout the process experts from development partners including unwomen fao undp unicef world bank gggi and who provided specialist advice both to line ministries and inputting directly in this document  development partners also provide a platform for ngo collaboration and women-focused ngos were consulted during the

was understood that some crucial areas of climate change policy and implementation were not adequately analysed specifically 1 gender 2 youth involvement and 3 privatesect engagement  gender overviewclimate change affects gender minorities disproportionately including women and girls  by exaggerating gender inequality climate change also reinforces a structural root cause of violence against women and girls18  in prioritising climate solutions a gender-balanced approach should incorporate the intersectional needs of the population to ensure inclusivity  addressing gender inequalities is therefore a priority for cambodia and gender has been effectively mainstreamed across planning and budgeting including in the context of addressing climate change  notably the cccsp includes a strategic objective to reduce sectoral regional gender vulnerability and health risks to climate change impacts  the ministry mandated with planning and facilitating the implementation of gender issues is the ministry of womens affairs mowa  the mowa has formed a gender and climate change committee which gathers information on gender and climate change conducts studies on the impact of climate change on women and children and builds climate change capacity in the ministrys departments  the mowa has also integrated climate change green growth and disaster risk management into neary rattanak iv the national policy on gender equality and womens empowerment  as part of this ndc update all ministries acknowledged the importance of addressing gender issues particularly womens participation in climate action  gender and age disaggregated data are crucially important in measuring the success of the gender targets not only related to womens participation but also womens access to skills and technology as well as women in climate-related decision making  mitigationmitigation priority actions including energy waste and transport all have linkages to gender equality and social inclusion and the potential to contribute to several gender-based indicators  gender-responsive mitigation actions and indicators will help measure these changes and also contribute to measuring the success of sdg 5 cambodias cedaw commitments and the cccsp  however the waste and energysects show a higher tendency of maintaining a gender balance and encouraging womens participation  there is high potential to contribute to gender equality through increasing energy access in rural areas by diversifying household and community energy generation sources  gender equality can be encouraged in mitigation actions such as through eco-payments  women constitute a higher proportion of the working population in agriculture and the forestsect is seen as providing strong opportunities to improve gender balance  in addition to continuing the enhancement of invited spaces for womens groups it will be important for gender outcomes to be adequately captured in the countrys redd+ safeguards information systems and the broader redd+ monitoring system  in the human health sector the importance of gender-disaggregated data is considered a priority especially to understand the different impacts of air-and vector-borne diseases on women and men  in disaster risk management drm little gender-disaggregated data collection exists therefore information on the differentiated impacts of disasters on women the elderly children disabled people and other socially marginalised groups is largely anecdotal  enabling actionsit is crucial to develop training and awareness materials that take particular gender-based needs and priorities into account to ensure that women and girls benefit equally from climate action  every effort was made to conduct such

generation transport industry waste forestry and agriculture in order to realize this ambitious target sri lanka further commits to achieve 70 renewable energy in electric generation by 2030 to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 in electric generation no capacity addition of coal power plants sri lanka has already launched following major initiatives adopting colombo declaration on sustainable nitrogen management with an ambition to halve nitrogen waste by 2030 banning agro-chemicals and chemical fertilizer promoting organic fertilizer and farming banning single-use plastics promoting e-mobility promoting circular economy sri lanka expects to achieve its carbon neutrality by 2060 chapter 1  therefore sri lanka reaches out to the global community for technical financial and additional capacity needs outlined in chapter 9 for effective ndc implementation and to keep the country on a low carbon trajectory as it strives for greater economic and social well-being of its people  a diverse topography and varied tropical climate have given rise to extremely high levels of faunal and floral diversity and high rates of endemicity  these districts display higher vulnerability to climate change due to enhanced sensitivity to climatic parameters and lower capacity to withstand climate hazards  lockdowns travel restrictions and border closing to manage multiple waves of the disease with increasing ferocity and mortality have depressed the economy and forced the government to offer lifelines to keep vital sectors afloat  these are ensuring domestic food production systems -agriculture and fisheries- are climate-sensitive and environmentally sustainable incentives for women to engage in agriculture productivity and food security efforts promoting efficient watermanage and irrigation systems enhancing the capacity of the health sector including digitization of services and sustainable health/hospital waste management enabling policies and incentives for renewable energy energy efficiency waste management green industry and transportation initiatives etc  these include investments in developing/fortifying the eroding coastline expanding irrigation and trans-basin diversions to moderate drought develop meteorological capacity and early warning capacity for floods/landslides  separate discussions with lead sectoral agencies/ministries were held to understand the development priorities institutional structures public finance availability and financing and capacity needs for ndcs in each sector 2 unconditional and conditional policy responses sri lanka interprets unconditional policy responses as those actions that have been identified in national plans and programmes prioritised for domestic investments public and private which can be implemented with domestic capacity  the total installed power generation capacity in 2019 was 4217 mw of which around 50 consists of renewable energy including large and small hydro wind solar and biomass  as it is essential to maintain a regular power supply with a practical and a balanced energy mix the firm capacity should be maintained with liquified natural gas lng or indigenous natural gas high-efficient coal power large storage hydro furnace oil refined from national refinery and non-conventional renewable energy sources9 which can provide the firm/ base power requirement

to climatic parameters etc  there is significant scope to build capacity across sectors in measuring reporting and verification mrv of climate change actions and monitoring and evaluation m&ampe systems that support mitigation adaptation and loss and damage sectors  some of the capacity needs specific to mrv/ m&ampe systems and resource mobilization include developing local climate vulnerability/resilience assessments using data and analytical tools tools and analysis to differentiate between business-as-usual development scenarios vs climate change impacts and forecasted impacts bau emissions scenario and potential ghg emission reduction pathways for some mitigation sectors and mitigation actions putting in place procedures to facilitate data availability to measure the impact to measure change through time  each pmc should make a detailed assessment of financial technical and capacity requirements for ndc implementation and ensure that these needs are communicated to the nsc and ccs  targets that require external financial and technical support to supplement the domestic capacity are declared as conditional targets  the government has pledged

technological institutional and information-based interventions specific to the sectors at risk as illustrated in figure 1 climate impacts adaptive capacities and vulnerabilities to adaptation actions24 mainstreaming gender and social safeguards into adaptation priorities is an important strategy  therefore it is recommended that down-scaled risk assessments and sectoral plans integrate specific needs vulnerabilities and capacities of women young children disabled and elderly populations  increased capacities among both men and women improved technical and science technology engineering and mathematics stem education more funding for vulnerability analysis at the local level etc  to enable greater engagement and contribution of women allowing the application of skills and capacities that are gender-specific  the concept of agro industrialization has been proposed to de-urbanize burgeoning cities and the government has launched many projects to bridge the infrastructure and service divide  climate change in the urban sector outmigration in agriculture-dependent communities as climatic threats worsen is expected to overpopulate cities across the world  urban heat islands will amplify the impact of heatwaves in cities  drought related watershortages are already evident in cities located in the higher watersheds -such as nuwara eliya and badulla  this includes a comprehensive understanding of risks associated with hydro-meteorological disasters aggravated by climate change natural processes impacted by climate change contributing to new hazards and disasters a strong data collection and reporting system capacities for forecasting and early warning risk mitigation and risk transfer mechanisms to inform and enable risk-informed national and local development planning and investments  this includes sector-specific gender analysis where needed developing gender-responsive actions improving capacities to engage women in planning and monitoring of

difficulties to define concrete characteristics of future climate risks the country has to cope with based on the already existing knowledge about them at national and sectorial levels along with by now visible impacts of climate change on moldovas population economy sectors ecosystems mentioned in the chapters above it is obvious that a rapid economic social and technological transformation is needed to pursue the sustainable path declared in the national development strategy moldova 2030  incorporation of adaptation into the republic of moldovas planning required a number of important decisions taking into account future risks and prioritizing early options  - guidance materials on gender incorporation from climate change perspective into development planning produced - training of sectorial planners on gender mainstreaming in sectorial planning and of sectorial communicators on communication of cca from gender perspective implemented  technologically innovative solutions new business models are expected to be deployed by international donors investors and the countrys privatesect in resilient infrastructure and nature-based solutions  promote collaboration between the financial system and actors of the supply chain as a mean to foster private investors engagement in climate resilience  in this regard the existing regulatory framework provides for the support of investors in electric generation installations from wind photovoltaic biogas and solid biomass cogeneration plants by granting fixed tariffs and a fixed price in support to climate action the adaptation component incorporates cross-sectorial and sector-specific adaptation actions and measures to be implemented along with identified adaptation investment priorities based on the review of national and sectorial development policies and plans and the outcomes of an extensive consultation process including stakeholders from all sectors and levels of governance in particular central public authorities and local public authorities climate-related institutions and agencies along with privatesect civil society academia and women associations and youth ngos representatives  planning processesgeneral information on the planning processesndc2 was developed based on the analytical basis used for developing the bur2 of the republic of moldova to the unfccc 2019 and it reflects the outcomes of mitigation measures of respective report which were widely discussed with all national stakeholders central and local authorities academic institutions ngos privatesect etc  climchangeadapt strategic vision and goal supporting institutional arrangements and policy framework 3 1 institutional arrangements governance and legal frameworkin the republic of moldova climchangeadapt cca planning and implementation is a shared responsibility and requires involvement by line ministries of the government their subordinated agencies local public authorities privatesect civil society  this commitment is to be reinforced via the approval of the above-mentioned dedicated government decision 2020 which will also institutionalize the coordination and oversight of both adaptation planning and implementation through the cross-sectorial multi-stakeholder climate change coordination mechanism chaired by the nccc  the sectorial approach in climchangeadapt planning of the republic of moldova derives from the ccas that sets out the priority sectors of adaptation and promotes actions to reduce climate impact through strengthened institutional capacities at national sectorial and local levels improved knowledge management convergent approach in climchangeadapt and disaster risks reduction  although the technical and financial requirements to build climate change resilience across economic sectors are still being assessed it is already clear that it will require significant effort and mobilization of innovative solutions financial resources institutional capacity and political will for effective adaptation action  sectorial and institutional capacity assessments icaica at a individual b organizational level c enabling environment undertaken in 7 key sectors agriculture water regional development health energy transport forestry  self-assessment process with regard to cca planning undertaken in 38 institutions  in the undertaken sectorial and institutional level capacity assessments of moldova it was concluded on several occasions that the need exists to strengthen the countrys capacities to plan and implement cross-sectorial adaptation  a number of climate-related assessments have been undertaken prior to the prioritization process vulnerability and risks assessments development of vulnerability indexes sector and institution capacity assessments gender assessments in relation to climate change institutional capacity surveys cost-benefit analysis cost-effectiveness analysis feasibility studies and other types of assessments and evaluation work that contributed to an informed decision during the prioritization process  enhance institutional capacities to effectively plan and implement cca - - address system-level gaps and impediments to effectively plan for and implement cca through a participatory capacity assessment at the individual institutional and enabling environment levels in all priority sectors to identify newly exposed weaknesses at the ministerial and sector levels  - adopt internal institutional level performance and incentive systems that encourage staff to promote ambitions transformative climate actions and provide tools to enable staff to contribute to climate-resilient and adaptation action  strengthen institutions to provide effective leadership and coordination of adaptation planning and action at the national and subnational level - - - - enhance political commitment and leadership at the highest level in promoting cca planning and action in moldova  reinforce the long-term coordinated approach to capacity development that addresses both institutional capacity needs and individual skills development  close prioritized knowledge gaps in cca at national and subnational levels based on a consistent and updated knowledge foundation - - - - close identified cca priority knowledge gaps at individual and institutional levels during the undertaken assessments through the involvement of adaptation experts and knowledge-providing institutions  implementation of required capacity-building activities for specific institutions of governance systems at the state national regional sub-national and local levels to apply adaptation planning to enhance in-house knowledge integrated disaster risk management improve the decision-making in the face of uncertainty - specialized institutions and agencies with national level status to deliver adaptation prerequisites such as fundamental climatic and other data analysis and assessments on climate change impacts vulnerability and early warning systems for informed decision making  improve disaster risk reduction management - - establish a legal and institutional framework for managing weather disasters in risk situations with a focus on the emergency response  improve capacitbuilding for technology development and transfer - - build institutional capacities to support the transfer of climate and environmentally sound technologies cests further encouragement of the innovation process and building targeted technical and scientific skills to utilize the technical-scientific potential for the development of context-specific climate-resilient technologies - undertake barrier analysis for technology transfer in the main sectors of the economy referring to economic and market barriers along with human capacity information and awareness institutional policy-related and regulatory barriers  engage the banking sector in scaling up privatesect climate finance through incountry financial institutions  enhance the expertise of relevant stakeholders in particular technical team and state institutions on systematic integration of gender considerations in all climate-relevant areas  as mentioned above the second iteration of the nap cycle will be implemented within two parallel implementation tracksthe first track - national adaptation plan nap-2 with the objective to reduce climate change-related risks throughout the country by strengthening institutional and technical capacities that support integrated cca planning and programming of forestry health water energy and transpsects  the first track of nap-2 consists of 31 activities grouped under sub-outcomes and three outcomes as follows outcome 1 national steering mechanism for long-term cca planning strengthened legal and institutional framework and mandate for the ccacm strengthened sub-outcome will support the strengthening of the cross-sectorial coordinated approach in line with the institutional and technical capacity needs development for an iterative adaptation planning process  key gaps in cca capacities identified and addressed sub-outcome will support a participatory capacity assessment at the individual institutional and enabling environment levels with regard to cca planning and implementation to be undertaken in all participating sectors includingfor consistencyagriculture along with the self-assessment survey on current and needed capacities to support medium and long-term adaptation planning to create an enabling environment for adaptation actions  sap comprises 17 activities grouped under the outcomes and sub-outcomes outcome 1 agsect gender-responsive adaptation planning governance and coordination established will set the basis for stronger governance to provide strategic guidance and increase the adaptive capacities in the agsect in moldova through institutional arrangements for the ag  adaptation solutions for addressing barriers to climate adaptation technology transfer identified and actions prioritized at national and/or sectoral levels sub-outcome will develop a training programme targeting both local and central level institutions and non-government partners to help them understand the impacts of climate change as well as vulnerability methodologies and socioeconomic assessment and valuation methodologies  outcome 3 climchangeadapt knowledge management information sharing and gender-sensitive communication established for the agsect systems developed for gathering organizing and updating relevant data and information on adaptation sub-outcome will focus on development and facilitation of a community of practices where the marde will on one hand share relevant information and will on the other hand facilitate exchanges between different stakeholders in different regions and institutions at national and subnational levels  outcome 4 aligning and mainstreaming adaptation into agsectal planning will aim to integrate cca measures and best practices at different levels central municipal and community level using the information and data and the institutional arrangements in place  while the needs for addressing climate change are still assessed within various activities it is obvious that implementation efforts will certainly be of significant proportions and will require the mobilization of innovative solutions financial resources institutional capacity and political will for effective action  the issue of adapting the health sector and population to climate change is addressed in the national public health strategy for2014-2020 gd no 1032/201337 which provides for the need for adopting a sectoral plan for adaptation and increased resilience including that of medical institutions the need for providing guidance and training to healthcare staff in issues of climate change impacts on population the draft government decision on the approval of the sectoral strategy for adapting the health system to climate change for 2018-202238 states sectoral priorities for the reducing the vulnerability and risks to health by implementing measures to adapt the healthcare sector to climate change  increase advocacy of iwrm by strengthening engagement with international watersect donors - ensure the functional cooperation between relevant sectors and institutions for a coordinated approach and efficient use of available resources- promote awareness and waterconserv - protect the wetlands areas allowing restoration of underground water and reducing peak discharges downstream - ensure flood risk management through the implementation of adequate measures  establish climateproofing of the health system - - increasing the resilience of health

strengthened  the assessment undertaken in transpsect points to the need for enormous investments in the physical infrastructure but also for associated measures such as institution and policy change capacitbuilding and development of strategic documents for the republic of moldova to adapt and build resilience to climate change  collaboration with ministries and their subordinated institutions has brought a broad range of useful sector expertise improving the understating of the sectoral context in relation to cca and ensuring country ownership - - - prioritized adaptation measures disaggregated into actions represent a focused and applicable response of sectors to climate risks adaptation measures identified and widely discussed at ministry level and comments from subordinated institutions and agencies incorporated sector specific policy documents of health and forestsects respond to climate threats in a holistic and applicable manner  - - information and training activities carried out during the nap1 strengthened institutions at national sector and district levels and improved understanding of cca the development of guidance materials was crucial for

township and city dwellers including the most vulnerable are safe from increased risks of rapid- and slow- onset natural disasters and live in sustainable inclusive low-carbon climate-resilient towns84 2 prioritization of adaptation actions resilient inclusive and sustainable cities two key sectoral outcomes envisaged by the mccmp are to ensure that town and city residents have access to resilient infrastructure and services that enable them to adapt to the new climatic context protecting them from natural hazards of increased intensity and frequency and enabling them to continue to react during and after shocks  by providing basic services that respond to the needs of the urban poor mitigation and adaptation approaches both feed into resilient city models in turn guiding the social and economic growth of cities  i interventions related to integrated waste management to strengthen urban resilience such as development of city-wide solid waste strategies to explore development of circular economies that enhance efficiencies within and between urban water energy and food systems with benefits for agricultural productivity and/or power generation taking into account specific vulnerabilities of formal and informal waste workers and exposure to pollutants for low-income and marginalized communities 3 enhancements in urban planning tools to support resilient infrastructure and the importance of balancing growth through support for secondary cities the ministry of constructions moc department of urban development and housing dudh is currently drafting the urban and regional development planning urdp law and associated rules and regulations and the yangon city development act was endorsed in 2019  myanmar has clear policy guidance in these areas but it requires further support to operationalize and finance local capacity and planning implementation  myanmar to have improved social protection gender consideration and risk finance capacity to prepare for and recover from potential loss and damage resulting from climate change  building capacity of the health sector to determine direct and indirect impacts of climate change on the transmission of current and emerging diseases  through formal education at all levels myanmar has prioritized investment in these sectors to increase the countrys research and innovation capacity professional development and training and awareness-raising on climate change  three recommendations to achieve the sectoral outcome are develop the capacity of educator to integrate principles of sustainability low-carbon development and resilience into the curricula at primary secondary and tertiary levels  develop the capacity of academics/researchers in the science technology and education sectors to

academic institutions and universities  in addition to the defined sectoral targets above myanmar welcomes support to increase the use of integrated resource management and planning approaches such as the urban nexus approach to promote low carbon city growth models and urban resilience paradigms for cities of all sizes  cities are now home to 29 of the population and thus need to be safe resilient environmentally viable and carbon-efficient without sacrificing development  education training and research will also be a key pillar to enhance local capacities and knowledge to understand and deal with the impacts of climate change  myanmar will work to develop resilient inclusive and sustainable cities and towns where people can live and thrive  urban planning physical infrastructure and building designs will be key to contribute to building resilience of cities and towns  limited capacities are a significant issue for myanmar and capacitbuilding will be an ongoing process  myanmar will need support to enhance human capacities throughout the various primary secondary tertiary education and vocational training domains  the mccs&ampmp outlines six prioritized sectors pertaining to adaptation mitigation and cross cutting issues namely climate-smart agriculture fisheries and livestock for food security sustainable management of natural resources for healthy ecosystems resilient

health and well being education science and technology for a resilient society  as part of the funding request submitted and approved by the gef for funding through the capacitbuilding initiative for transparency cbit stream myanmar intends to strengthen its institutional and human capacities to track and report transparently on implementation of this ndc and support received  these include limitations in 1 technical capacities 2 policies laws and regulatory processes and 3 financing mechanisms  the following data will be collected year-wise commissioned capacities by energy source category year-wise energy generated and supplied to the grid by energy source category fuel-use by category and sub-category in transport industry energy-efficiency measures baseline or control group data will be continually monitored as well as the results of implemented energy efficiency measures  establish institutional capacities for a monitoring and reporting system of agroforestry systems adoption and production and adaptation co-benefits related to gendered socio- economic outcomes i  measuring and reporting capacities for redd+ are further enhanced through a functional fully national scale national forest inventory and efficient satellite-based forest degradation/ restoration monitoring tools as mentioned in the national forest management strategy nfms be developed for tracking carbon flux changes on forest areas remaining forests  once mrv capacities have been upgraded to include activities relevant for forests remaining forests including a baseline for target setting and measurements the scope of the reference level will be updated to include forest management and restoration on existing forests possibly conservation of forest carbon stocks too  under the conditional scenario the mrv capacities for redd+ will be further enhanced through a functional fully national scale national forest inventory and efficient satellite-based forest degradation/ restoration monitoring tools be developed for tracking carbon flux changes on forest areas remaining forests  currently with limited capacities no transport mitigation commitments are made in this ndc  a regional and urban development planning and intra-urban transport law could include transport related policy tools that would guide low carbon transport-oriented development which also contributes to the development of compact sustainable cities  worldwide ambient air pollution accounts for up to 29 of all deaths from lung cancer and 43 of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease due to the burning of fossil fuels in cars trucks and various industrial activities sited in cities  aviation similar to the marine sector the growing aviation sector means myanmar is interested in enhancing its capacities

cities planning with regard to the national spatial development framework plan 2014 department of urban housing and development duhd under the ministry of construction has been developing conceptual town development plans  for example to build key gis capacities support is needed for myanmars resilient cities development plans by strengthening the urban research and development institute established in 2012  these projects will focus on demonstrating scalable best-practice approaches for myanmars secondary cities  this represents a significant opportunity for reducing ghg emissions in the process of achieving myanmars infrastructure growth needs as well as increasing the resilience of these cities to effects of climate change as highlighted in section 4  in cities such as taunggyi or pathein that have greater need for support in basic service delivery the project pipeline will focus more on supporting integrated solid waste planning flood management or passive urban cooling through increased urban tree planting and building retrofits  these approaches will draw upon good urban practices for small and medium sized cities from around the region  in order to achieve the mitigation actions highlighted above myanmars towns cities as well as states and regional governments will require international assistance to build capacity across all relevant agencies in order to strengthen and build coordination assessment of key vulnerabilities and in development of urban planning frameworks and governance institutions  and education training and research will also be a key pillar to enhance local capacities and knowledge to understand and deal with the impacts of climate change  awareness building awareness and capacities at all levels of society to enable climate-

climate risk management for peoples health and well being education science and technology for a resilient society  protecting and genetic upgrading of indigenous livestock breeds and support for artificial insemination services building capacities of younger farmers and informing them re licensing procedures for overseas export to enhance socio-economic resilience and discourage migration  resilient inclusive and sustainable cities and towns where people can live work and thrive cities and human settlements are now home to 29 of myanmars population  therefore the solutions to addressing many of the more urgent climatic challenges in cities are closely coupled with improvements in urban planning physical infrastructure and the addressing of service provision gaps 1 assessment of loss and damage resilient inclusive and sustainable cities as yet there is very limited information for the losses and damages on urban environment due to climate change  most of myanmars cities are however exposed on an annual basis to a combination of landslides and flooding during the monsoon months and/or seasonal watershortages and peak temperatures due to urban heat islands in the summer months  additionally climate-associated extreme events have exacerbated rural-urban and international migration trends providing ready a ready supply of labor in urban areas but also overwhelming the infrastructure and resulting in the development of large areas of informal settlements in myanmars cities 2 prioritization of adaptation actions resilient inclusive and sustainable cities two key sectoral outcomes envisaged by the mccmp are to ensure that town and city residents have access to resilient infrastructure and services that enable them to adapt to the new climatic context protecting them from natural hazards of increased intensity and frequency and enabling them to continue to react during and after shocks  by providing basic services that respond to the needs of the urban poor mitigation and adaptation approaches both feed into resilient city models in turn guiding the social and economic growth of cities  in parallel cities must look towards steps that focus on disaster risk reduction elaborated in 4  through the myanmar climate change alliance and ongoing projects such as the green climate fund green cities project myanmar has consulted with local stakeholders to enhance adaptation actions in the infrastructure sector  measures to promote and assess the impacts of conservation and expansion of peri-urban and urban green spaces and forests on diverse co-benefits including improvements in air quality reduced noise pollution health benefits from access to spaces for outdoor recreation and aesthetic appeal of cities for residents investors and tourists impacts on land values and municipal revenue generation 3 enhancements in urban planning tools to support resilient infrastructure and the importance of balancing growth through support for secondary cities the ministry of constructions moc department of urban development and housing dudh is currently drafting the urban and regional development planning urdp law and associated rules

smallholder farmers in malawi are resource poor with very limited capacity to contain shocks arising from climate change  these challenges serve to further threaten malawis capacity to adapt to climate change impacts and provide an important context for the countrys development and environmental policy priorities  the government has also developed a number of initiatives and processes to assist vulnerable communities and ecosystems to adapt and mitigate to both current and projected climate change impacts through increased adaptive capacity and resilience enhanced carbon sinks reduced

and key risks per sector in malawi sector climate drivers key risks causes of vulnerability ecosystems and biodiversity temperature increase precipitation lake surface temperature increase shifts in biome distribution and severe impacts on wildlife due to diseases and species extinction soil erosion declining soil fertility loss of vegetation cover low technology uptake weak coordination among various sectors as forestry environment agriculture and waterresources management waterresources temperature increase/ extreme temperature precipitation/ extreme precipitation lake surface temperature increase compounded stress on waterresources facing significant strain from overexploitation and degradation at present and increased demand in the future with drought stress exacerbated in drought-prone regions the quantity of surface waterresources in malawi especially in rivers is highly dependent on the availability of rainfall which sustains runoff many river basins in the country are under severe pressures due to deforestation unsustainable agriculture settlements mining industry commerce tourism and climate change manually operated system for flood forecasting and flood warning in the country and it is only the lower shire valley that has such a system in place the main shortfall with the ews for droughts is that it mainly focuses on food security rather than being a multisectoral tool where the impact of droughts on waterresources health energy drm and tourism are considered agriculture fisheries and livestock temperature increase/extreme temperature precipitation/extreme precipitation reduced crop productivity associated with heat and drought stress with strong adverse effects on regional national and household livelihood and food security also given increased pest and disease damage and flood impacts on food system infrastructure adverse effects on livestock linked to temperature rise and precipitation changes that lead to increased heat and water stress and shifts in the range of pests and diseases with adverse impacts on pastoral livelihoods and rural poverty exposure to climate extremes most smallholder farmers are resource poor as such they have very limited capacity to contain shocks arising from climate change particularly floods strong winds and droughts limited agro-processing facilities over-dependency on rain-fed agriculture and biomass energy lack of insurance schemes to compensate farmers and fishers inadequate hazard maps poor crop diversification overfishing weed infestation and eutrophication infrastructure buildings and energy cyclones and winds extreme weather events disrupt transport systems production systems infrastructure public services water education health sanitation especially in informal areas flooding exposure to extreme events and lake level raise with damages and disruptions in the supply chains environmental degradation insufficient capacity liquidity problems and vandalism water level fluctuations silting human health and wellbeing temperature increase/extreme temperature precipitation/ extreme precipitation changes in the incidence and geographic range of vector-and water-borne diseases due to changes in the mean and variability of temperature and precipitation particularly along the edges of their distribution undernutrition with its potential for life-long impacts on health and development and its associated increase in vulnerability to malaria and diarrheal diseases can result from changing crop yields migration due to weather and climate extremes and other factors increased migration leading to human suffering human rights violations political instability and conflict exposure to the vectors that propagate malaria and diarrhoeal diseases malnutrition exposure to extreme events that may cause injuries and life losses source authors based on gom 2015a and ipcc analysis 6  the ten strategic options are related to the three

and women the differentiated impacts by gender of energy poverty and gender roles in the energysect  women and men use and depend on forests and products differently  according to statistical and meteorological records since 2004 there has been an increase in the frequency of extreme events in the country with hydro-meteorological events having affected the most different ecosystems as well as the most vulnerable population including women  despite the fact that the legal framework for water is outdated in terms of climate action the sector has a long-term strategic instrument in implementation that can be the framework for said transformational adaptation towards a national model of water resilience the national plan for watersecurity pnsh 2015-2050 water for all pnsh in addition to the legal gap the resilience of the watersect faces other weaknesses related to the lack of a consolidated meteorological network aimed at generating a database for the study of climate change with a record of data disaggregated by sex that evidences the different vulnerabilities to which exposed by men and women and lack of budget for the execution of research programs and planning of waterresources at the level of hydrographic basins  for this reason panama is committed to achieving equitable access to adequate sanitation and hygiene services for all people paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and people in vulnerable situations  to this end the government will facilitate the participation of men women children and vulnerable groups in the

suffer disproportionate impacts caused by the degradation of the oceans loss of marine biodiversity and natural resources  the national biodiversity strategy and plan 2018-2050 highlights the different perspective that men and women can have on biodiversity its intrinsic value from the environmental point of view and its social value as an element that contributes to human life  it is also recognized that the actions of conservation sustainable use and restoration of diversity can be a dynamic element in local rural communities in the country particularly benefiting young people and women 3 operational aspectsthe commitment will be supported by the national adaptation planning process with preparatory resources from the green climate fund in alignment with biodiversity strategies and their related instruments as well as through the national gender action plan that aims to achieve participation and empowerment of panamanian women in the management and conservation objectives of natural resources  the climate change guide for the biodiversity sector will include recognition of contributions and knowledge differentiated by gender to promote opportunities and solutions based on nature that involve and value men and women as agents of conservation  the strengthening of the sector must have an impact on the generation of income for a significant section of the panamanian population and it is expected that through the inclusive public policy planning process rural women will particularly benefit from taking an active part from the planning phases to execution phases  it should be noted that these diseases have a direct impact on the responsibilities and care burdens especially of women and girls as has been evidenced by the covid-19 pandemic  disparities in access to a good quality structure leaves women in an evident condition of vulnerability in this sense it should be highlighted how infrastructure services are a determining component of social inclusion poverty reduction and promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women  the design of a sustainable infrastructure that takes into account the different needs and preferences of men and women leads to a more inclusive development 4  waste management actions also have repercussions on gender equality considering that initiatives by womens groups focused on the reuse and recycling of

" according to the supreme decree of its creation the cancc proposes and recommends within the framework of perus national strategy on climate change actions to neutralize ghg emissions and adapt to climate change by 2050 as well as it proposes the progressive increase of the ambition of our national contributions considering the proposals and recommendations elaborated by subnational governments indigenous or native peoples the privatesect or any other non-state actor  the ministry of the environment of peru in its capacity as presidency and technical secretariat of this commission was in charge of preparing the technical report that served as the basis for the preparation of the report of the countrys indc proposal3 elevated to the unfccc in september 2015  additionally the agreement proposes increasing the capacity to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change and promoting climate resilience and development with low ghg emissions as well as placing financial flows at a level compatible with a path that leads to development  in this regard the country is committed to contributing to the global goal of adaptation to climate change established in article 7 of the paris agreement which consists of increasing adaptive capacity strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate change with a view to to contribute to sustainable development and achieve an adequate adaptation response in the context of the objective of limiting the increase in temperature mentioned in article 2 of the same agreement  in this way the country has made a significant effort to build a model for adaptation to climate change based on risk management in the face of the effects of climate change which contributes to planning and implementing actions aimed at guiding the reduction of the exposure and vulnerability as well as to increase the adaptive capacity of the different vulnerable subjects of the country to the dangers associated with climate change16  this process is carried out through the ministry of the environment in its capacity as the national authority on climate change in coordination with the competent state sectors  additionally the country has made this update of its national contributions taking into consideration and consistently with a long-term vision that leads us to achieve a balance between anthropogenic ghg emissions and removals and more favorable situations with regard to reducing risks and increasing adaptive capacity in 2050  7 peruvian contribution to the achievement of the objective of the convention perus ndcs will contribute so that the objectives of the unfccc related to stabilizing ghg concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that prevents dangerous anthropogenic interference in the climate system from being achieved as well as increasing adaptation capacity strengthening resilience and reduce vulnerability to climate change with a view to contributing to sustainable and climate-responsible development  likewise during cop 20 it was stressed that this future agreement should reflect the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capacities cbdr-rc understood in the light of different national circumstances  thus each of the parties must increase the ambition of their national contributions in successive communications to the convention in periods of five years taking into account their common but differentiated responsibilities and their respective capacities in light of the different national circumstances  peru recognizes that capacities to mitigate climate change are lower in historically excluded populations and that an action aimed at promoting citizen participation in the implementation of an adaptation measure cannot be carried out without considering the inequality and vulnerability of these social groups as this would affect its scope its impact and its sustainability  the ace relies on education training awareness campaigns public participation access to information and international cooperation to be an instrument articulator of capacities that facilitate the design and implementation of programs and strategies on climate change from various fronts  ipcc cambridge university press  the gtm-ndc process was based on a work of articulation and multisectoral involvement between the government sectors that are responsible

adaptation to climate change from the point of view of international commitments peru has been a promoter and pioneer in the incorporation of the adaptation component to climate change as part of national contributions since cop 20 held in lima peru  in this way the integration of adaptation in planning its inclusion in policy design and its incorporation in decision-making processes can promote synergies with development disaster risk reduction and biodiversity conservation  scope and coveragescope national prioritized thematic areas objectives and adaptation measures are established

incorporation of cross-gender intercultural and intergenerational approaches in the measures that make up our contributions and in all processes related to the comprehensive management of climate change  regarding the incorporation of cross-cutting approaches it is important to indicate that the peruvian state has made an effort to articulate and operationalize the elements of the action for climate empowerment ace26 which aim to legitimize climate action and guarantee the scope of national policies on climate change through broad citizen participation  in this way the peruvian state has worked in recent years to strengthen its institutional framework to guarantee participation spaces for non-state actors in the processes of design of adaptation and mitigation measures facilitating spaces for articulation and agreement between the various state and non-state actors linked to the integral management of climate change and to strengthen and provide legitimacy to the management of ghg emissions and reductions in peru  to do this it is preparing the necessary domestic conditions such as institutional arrangements regulations and procedures which once applied contribute to

in this context and in parallel to the process of updating our ndcs the peruvian state has strengthened the regulations and institutional framework that support the integral management of climate change in the country  the main elements included in the lmcc are i articulation with the international context ii incorporation of climate change in national development planning iii institutional strengthening iv increased competitiveness of investment and the national public budget v support for science and technology and vi monitoring of the contributions determined at the national level  renami is a digital platform through which public and private institutions can register their initiatives that contribute to the reduction of ghg emissions  in addition through this platform it will be possible to transfer the ghg reduction produced by the mitigation actions carried out by these institutions in order for them to participate in the national and international carbon markets thus contributing to the action climate of the country  in other words peru has strengthened its institutional framework for the comprehensive management of climate change in such a way that it guarantees

and capacity-building support while it continues to seek sovereignty freedom and independence  the adaptation actions identified and included in the updated ndcs aim to reduce climate sensitivity or increase adaptive capacity in relation to each of the highly vulnerable issues across these sectors and take into consideration national development goals  conditional ndc actions improve the capacity for disease prevention by training 300 health professionals in disease prevention by 2025 at least a 30 increase in the awareness of people particularly women by 2030 about measures that they can take to help prevent major diseases related to water sanitation and food by 2030 the capacity of the ministry of health to monitor the safety of water food and sanitation increases by at least 50 from the situation in 2020  moreover air pollution from road transport amplifies the urban-heat-island effect increasing the capacity of surfaces to absorb and retain heat  conditional ndc actions reducing the emissions of the passenger vehicle fleet by 8 by 2030 and 24 by 2040 scrapping 60 of vehicles older than 20 years by 2030 and scrapping all vehicles older than 20 years by 2040 conducting statutory

by 2030 and 40 by 2040  the plant is operating at 50 of its capacity due to the israeli occupation 0 i  the plant is operating at its full capacity electric imports the starting point is 90 imported and 10 produced  these assumptions include that 90 of palestines energy is imported from israel and that the gaza power plant gpp will operate at full capacity but with a transmission constraint of 50 due to israeli occupation  it is assumed that the gpp will operate on full capacity in the bau independence scenario instead of 50 as in the bau status-quo scenario  the imported electric is also assumed to decrease to zero in 2040 in the bau independence scenario as palestines new power plants will be operating at full capacity by 2040 and the renewable electric target will be met  conditional ndc actions reducing the emissions of the passenger vehicle fleet by 8 by 2030 and 24 by 2040 scrapping 60 of vehicles older than 20 years by 2030 and scrapping all vehicles older than 20

including through providing opportunities for inclusive participation capacity and skill-building  a great deal has already been done to assess capacitbuilding needs including an assessment of national capacities for implementing adaptation and mitigation measures and identifying needs for capacity development of palestinian authority institutions regarding climate adaptation and mitigation development of a national capacity development programme for the palestinian authority implementation of phase 1 of the capacity development action plan on climate change including identification of needs to establish a regulatory and legal framework identification of institutional structures recommendations for development of the enabling policy environment and all necessary capacity-building activities in relation to the new conditional ndc actions encompassed by each of the 14 ndc implementation action plans  some capacity-building activities to implement palestines updated ndcs are already underway through caep support  these involve conducting capacity-building that is relevant to the institutions that will develop and implement palestines policies in relation to the ndc implementation action plans  the capacity-building activities will develop expertise and technical guidance drawing from best practices in the region and globally  it was also assumed under the bau status-quo scenario the gpp is operating at full capacity but a transmission constraint of 50 was assumed as a result of israeli occupation  subsequently under the bau independence scenario the gpp the two planned west bank gas power plants as well as solar pv plant are all operating at full capacity and the 50 transmission constraint on gpp is removed  nonetheless it is important to note that this contribution is conditional it relies on financial technology transfer and capacity-building support from developed country parties to achieve this ambition  by 2030 the capacity of the ministry

thereby enhance the climate resilience of the national development process and local communities  the extent to which they reduce climate sensitivities increase adaptive capacities and reduce exposure and mitigation benefits alongside a range of other criteria  5 adaptation israeli occupation substantially reduces palestines adaptive capacities thereby compounding climate vulnerabilities  these limitations on palestines adaptive capacities are most prevalent in area c which is under full israeli control and covers more than 61 of the occupied west bank and in the gaza strip  conditional ndc actions to address these needs two ndc implementation action plans have been developed for the health sector on 1 increasing awareness and capacities for disease prevention and 2 developing safety and monitoring systems for water food and sanitation  rapid population growth and urbanisation are contributing to the sensitivity of cities to climate  steps may be taken to address the current lack of quantitative national datasets in relation to the highly vulnerable issues and their component climate sensitivities and adaptive capacities  a great deal has already been done to assess

action plan on climate change including identification of needs to establish a regulatory and legal framework identification of institutional structures recommendations for development of the enabling policy environment and all necessary capacity-building activities in relation to the new conditional ndc actions encompassed by each of the 14 ndc implementation action plans  palestines ndc partnership plan also includes targets to ensure the capacities of the state of palestines institutions to mainstream and address the challenges of climate change in the areas of reporting mitigation adaptation and climate finance are enhanced subject to the availability of finance to achieve these targets  the programme promoted the use of renewable energy and energy efficiency measures in the country supported the role of the privatesect in financing and structuring sustainable projects and strengthened the capacities of local stakeholders involved  finally in addition to the sunref programme many other activities and training workshops have been carried out in palestine to enhance the capacities of local actors to access climate finance some examples of these actions are outlined in palestines ndc investment plan  health increasing awareness and capacities for disease prevention training health professionals and increasing the awareness of people particularly women in all areas about measures they can take to help prevent major diseases related to water sanitation and food and increasing awareness of people particularly women in all areas of measures they can take to help prevent major diseases related to water sanitation and food  this will thereby increase transparency for investors and create an attractive environment for financial flows  establishing clear climate change budgeting and appraisal guidelines to identify funding gaps and provide investors with clarity  key stakeholders and national partners across all sectors in palestine have worked collaboratively to develop these climate adaptation and mitigation goals and to strengthen the national institutions in palestine to ensure that the goals and targets of these updated ndcs are achieved driving sustainable development and ensuring prosperity for future generations  the ndc implementation action plans contain smart3 targets which form the basis of revised ndc actions for those six sectors activities and associated detailed costings to achieve those targets institutional arrangements for implementation of the plans and associated activities and policy recommendations to ensure an enabling environment for plan implementation  the mrv system will take advantage of the existing institutional set up for data collection for the ghg inventory  defining roles for monitoring and tracking climate finance flows some of which may lie outside of government in line with palestines institutional arrangements  in palestine as in all countries capacitbuilding is needed

intends to explore other financing options including leveraging private finance through enhanced privatesect engagement and exploring the role of carbon markets  development of water food and sanitation monitoring and safety systems using high technology related to health palestines technology roadmap also encourages leveraging privatesect finance to implement technology solutions particularly in sectors which can bring revenues  leveraging privatesect finance is addressed in section 9  it includes a review of palestines climate-finance landscape current and potential donor mapping and recommended measures to scale-up climate finance and access additional funding from donors the privatesect and other sources 2 scaling-up private climate finance and enhancing privatesect engagement in climate action the state of palestine acknowledges the vital role of the privatesect in contributing to both national climate adaptation and mitigation goals  government policy aims to encourage participation of the privatesect at all levels of planning including in governance and collaboration integrating climate adaptation and disaster risk reduction and management into business plans aligning private-sector activities with national targets and creating the enabling environment for public-private partnerships  to realise the opportunities presented by private climate finance and privatesect involvement more broadly creative approaches will need to be considered  for example blended finance which strategically uses development finance to attract commercial capital can help de-risk investment opportunities making them more attractive to the privatesect and kick-starting investment 39 the ndc implementation action plans seek to secure public funding for baseline assessments and pilots while also engaging the privatesect in these efforts  an example of privatesect engagement comes from the sunref palestine programme which provides private actors with facilitated access to finance to help them grasp the opportunities of the environmental and energy transition  the programme promoted the use of renewable energy and energy efficiency measures in the country supported the role of the privatesect in financing and structuring sustainable projects and strengthened the capacities of local stakeholders involved  the mrv system will be integrated

mitigation measures based on equity ensuring equal and equitable protection of women children the poor and other vulnerable groups 3 health adaptation needs future climate scenarios for palestine are expected to impact health in the following ways among others warm temperatures stagnant water resulting from floods and high water temperatures may favour the survival and reproduction rates of vectors of diseases such as mosquitoes fleas ticks and/or rodents which can contaminate water bodies and food sources runoff from floods may contaminate soil and water bodies making water unsafe for human consumption and/or contaminate crops and livestock thereby increasing water-borne and food-borne diseases higher temperatures will make it more challenging to preserve food products along the value chain increasing the chances of food-borne diseases and degrading the quality of fresh products higher temperatures and reduced rainfall may cause heat stress and dehydration particularly among vulnerable population such as children and the elderly reduced rainfall and higher temperatures may also reduce the quantity and quality of crops and livestock produced for consumption and the availability of water which may indirectly increase the likelihood of diseases  at a national level palestine will implement adaptation and mitigation measures based on equity ensuring equal and equitable protection of women children the poor and other vulnerable groups  conditional ndc actions improve the capacity for disease prevention by training 300 health professionals in disease prevention by 2025 at least a 30 increase in the awareness of people particularly women by 2030 about measures that they can take to help prevent major diseases related to water sanitation and food by 2030 the capacity of the ministry of health to monitor the safety of water food and sanitation increases by at least 50 from the situation in 2020  the state of palestine regards ace initiatives as an ideal opportunity to engage youth women and other vulnerable groups in ndc implementation including enhancing the visibility and best use of the latest available science by incorporating it into educational programmes at different levels  globally women and girls are disproportionately affected by the impacts of the climate crisis as existing vulnerabilities are intensified and intersect with a range of social economic and political inequalities33  palestines technology roadmap is designed to be gender responsive and makes recommendations throughout to ensure that the differing needs of women and men along with other groups including youth persons with disabilities and refugees are met  palestines ndc implementation action plans which include targets used to update the conditional actions contained in the first ndc were reviewed by a team of gender experts including a representative of ministry of womens affairs  palestines ndc partnership plan includes an output to enhance awareness of and therefore support for climate action amongst the general public supported by a key performance indicator kpi that by 2030 at least an additional 30 of the population particularly women is aware of measures that they can take to support adaptation and mitigation efforts 40 they could also have greater impact on women for example by imposing environmental taxes on energy products for domestic use on which women tend to spend a higher share of their disposable income  health increasing awareness and capacities for disease prevention training health professionals and

in power relationships between women and men  the new conditional actions are gender- responsive time-bound and contain measurable targets evidencing palestines increased ambition in the updated ndcs  all of palestines climate actions will be gender responsive and will be based on equity ensuring equitable protection of disadvantaged groups in society  the nap identifies the following 12 sectors as highly vulnerable to climate change agriculture coastal and marine energy food gender health industry terrestrial ecosystems tourism urban and infrastructure waste and wastewater and water  rather than addressing gender as a separate sector gender has been mainstreamed in all ndc implementation action plans developed for six of the highly vulnerable sectors agriculture energy health transport

of a monitoring and evaluation system for adaptation that meets the requirements for reporting in line with the etf including special consideration of gender issues 1 gender the state of palestine recognises that impacts of climate change are not gender neutral32  a business-as-usual approach is likely to exacerbate existing inequalities and limit the opportunities for gender-sensitive and where appropriate gender- responsive adaptation actions that may improve gender equality  at the unfcccs 25th conference of the parties in 2019 the enhanced lima work programme on gender and its gender action plan acknowledged the need for gender mainstreaming through all relevant targets and goals noting that gender-responsive implementation of climate policy and action can raise ambition enhance gender equality and promote a just transition of the workforce34  integrating gender equality into development leads to better outcomes in terms of economic efficiency productivity and policy choices35  gender responsive solutions can help to tackle poverty and inequality while providing better community representation and technical solutions36  palestines technology roadmap is designed to be gender responsive and makes recommendations throughout to ensure that the differing needs of women and men along with other groups including youth persons with disabilities and refugees are met  it provides recommendations to ensure that all solutions adopted by palestine are designed through a gender and inclusion perspective including through providing opportunities for inclusive participation

qatar ministry of municipality and environment nationally determined contribution ndc august 2021 1  energy efficiency measures such as district cooling and energy labeling for all electronic devices are systematically being deployed and play a growing role in the national economic diversification strategy by reducing energy intensity and the need for energy subsidies while also mitigating the overall ghg emissions of households and small &amp medium enterprises  qatar is considered a pioneer in the field of district cooling dc  district cooling relies on large- scale centralized cooling that provides a wide spectrum of savings in energy consumption and infrastructure  lastly qatar has continuously strived to upgrade its sewage treatment plants to produce treated effluents suitable for purposes such as landscaping fodder crops irrigation district cooling construction industry use etc  additionally savings are increasingly made by using recycled water in district cooling the construction industry and for a growing number of other usages  a steadily growing number of projects to install solar panels on residential buildings are being undertaken by the privatesect  g

adaptation is drawn from the inap with the objective to enhance adaptive capacity strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability by half by 2030 through increased risk awareness improvements in rule compliance increased institutional capacity and an integrated approach to adaptation in development policy and programs across sectors and scales  it also expands on the goals set for adaptation in the inap which include increasing resilience capacity at all scales supporting an integrative approach to climchangeadapt programming and policymaking allocating 10 of annual national budgets to climchangeadapt across sectors harmonizing climate-relevant policies and regulations to improve coordination and cross-sector linkages mainstreaming adaptation into local development plans by 2025 institutionalize nap implementation through laws policies and regulations establishing a national trust fund for channelling adaptation support across sectors and securing 40 of international development funding to support adaptation priorities across different sectors  considering the nature and extent of sierra leones climate impacts and low adaptive capacity the commitments made in this ndc are fair and ambitious and are based on conditions of equity availability of finance and the potential for achieving sdgs and other regional climate goals  waste the ndc will use assessments of the capital citys waste burden by the world bank and waste-related emissions in the third national communications to set targets for reducing methane emissions from landfills and design a strategy for using appropriate technology to produce a nutrient-rich digestate that can be used for food production 1 million trees already planted developed and implemented the voluntary guideline on the responsible governance of tenure of land fisheries and forest in the context of national food security based on the analysis above the following gaps have been identified most of the strategies lacked concrete actions and targets linked partly to a lack of institutional capacity  this is gradually changing with the growing appetite for climate mitigation by both public and private entities there

analyses strengths including that the climchangeadapt and mitigation information are readily available to the public the government has several channels of communication at its disposal the public is willing to change attitudes and behaviours if they receive the appropriate climate change education and communication there is technical personnel with the capacity to implement climate change communication initiatives and there is evidence of political will to support climchangeadapt and communication  opportunities including that there are funding opportunities to support capacity- building initiatives on climate change communication in sierra leone and development partners are committed to supporting climate change-associated initiatives in the country and threats including that most of the general public is still in denial about climate change some politicians religious and cultural leaders still miscomprehend facts about climate change there is an excessive use of scientific terminology and technical information in communicating climate change and there is limited positive change in behaviours attitudes perceptions and practices  overall ndc actions will

capacity development  in may 2020 the bulawayo city council implemented a weekly 144-hours water- shedding programme following an acute shortage of water when the lower ncema dam was decommissioned after the water level reached an all-time low of 6  environmental stress functions as an aggravating factor which adds to systemic economic and demographic factors that shape individual access to livelihoods access to resources and vulnerability and ultimately affect their capacity to move  reduced supplies of agricultural raw materials also reduce employment opportunities in industry and commerce as was the case during the extreme drought of 1991/92 when a number of industries faced closure particularly in the city of bulawayo  adaptation benefits actions under this measure are expected to increase adaptive capacity by providing the technology and tools necessary to increase efficiency of agricultural production  adaptive capacity would also be improved by providing the tools to anticipate future changes in climate and adjust production accordingly  widespread adoption of climate-smart agriculture including conservation tillage would contribute to mitigation efforts by increasing resource-use efficiency and increasing capacity of healthier soils to capture and sequester carbon  adaptation benefits actions under this measure would benefit all sectors by increasing their adaptive capacity through improving knowledge of future events and improving systems to prevent prepare for and/or manage their consequences  actions under this measure are expected to increase their adaptive capacity by providing the tools and knowledge to better manage waterresources and to reduce their sensitivity by increasing the availability of water  furthermore crop and pasture productivity would increase which would increase carbon-capture capacity through roots and residues all other things being equal  all actions will be implemented subject to availability of affordable international financial support investment ability to leverage domestic resources technology development and transfer and capacity development  the various funding technology and capacity mechanisms

other challenges include high investment costs for retrofits such as the installation of the nitrous oxide secondary catalyst lack of technical expertise for operation and maintenance of imported technologies and lack of adequate technical skills and financial capacity to implement the hfc phasedown measures 1 49 challenges to implementation include inadequate institutional and financial capacity for all measures apart from increasing the area of forest plantation and a need for improved human and technical capacity to implement and monitor mitigation measures  some of the measures would also improve zimbabwes adaptive capacity reduced burning and lead to increased value chain development for timber and non-timber forest products reduced burning and forest restoration  the policy guides climate change management in the country enhances the national adaptive capacity scales up mitigation actions facilitates domestication of global policies and ensures compliance to the global mechanisms  nccrs is anchored on seven pillars namely i adaptation and risk management ii mitigation and low carbon strategies iii capacityto effect iv governance framework v finance and

acknowledged when joining the paris agreement the achievement of the ndc target is subject to full implementation by developed countries of their commitments relating to finance technology and capacity pursuant to article 4 of the convention full effective and sustained implementation of the convention receiving contributions by developed countries on all elements set out in paragraph 5 of decision 1/cp 17 relating to mitigation adaptation finance technology development and transfer and capacity-building in the context of a global and comprehensive agreement for the period beyond 2020  several adaptation measures included in the ndc can contribute mitigation co-benefits including improvements in waterresources management may have mitigation co-benefits in two ways i increased efficiency in wateruse may increase renewable hydropower supply displacing thermal power and ii better watermanage in agriculture may increase crop and pasture productivity enhancing carbon capture capacity through roots and residues  widespread adoption of climate-smart agriculture may contribute to mitigation efforts by increasing resource-use efficiency and increasing capacity of healthier soils to capture carbon  preserving ecosystems and forests and sustainable land use will lead to mitigation benefits through improved carbon-storage capacity 1 vulnerability to climate change and adaptation zimbabwes climate vulnerabilities identified here as a function of climate sensitivities and adaptive capacities5 have been determined from review of the countrys relevant national studies  zimbabwes sustainable development is constrained by climate sensitivities and associated lack of adaptive capacities of its human physical natural social and financial capital in relation to the direct and indirect impacts of slow-onset climate changes and extreme weather events  high climate sensitivities and low adaptive capacities of zimbabwe across sectors include in no particular order insufficient water availability due to a predominantly dry climate compounded by growing competition for waterresources increases all sectors vulnerability to the potential impact of watershortages on production levels  in order to avoid further similar and more damaging impacts zimbabwe urgently needs to implement a wide range of adaptation measures which seek to reduce climate sensitivities increase adaptive capacities and/or reduce direct or indirect exposure to climate-related hazards  incorporation of legumes in crop rotations has the potential to significantly reduce nitrogen fertilizer demand and ammonium nitrate fertilizer production thus driving a corresponding reduction in nitrous oxide emissions  section 5 presents the package of policies and legislation that will underpin implementation of the ndc and section 6 outlines the institutional and financial framework  social capital exposure zimbabwes societal stability relies on norms relationships and networks social structure and cohesion and institutions and laws  on the other hand climate variability and change also has impacts on institutions as it strengthens the need for implementing adaptation and social policies alongside economic growth  in 2012 only a few women 3 and men 4 were served by other formal financial institutions such as insurance companies 1 49 challenges to implementation include

youths and children people who are physically handicapped indigenous peoples migrants and internally displaced and inhabitants of unfavourable agro-ecological regions  impacts on health from heat-stress are also increasing as a result of extreme temperatures which may be particularly harmful to children and the elderly partly because of their physiological predisposition and limited ability to manage their heat risk  women and children also more pronouncedly suffer the social consequences of a crisis situation in which protection mechanisms are minimal  as zimbabwe looks ahead to the continuation of implementation of the ndc further stakeholder engagement is envisaged ensuring that vulnerable groups including those representing women and youth as well as sub-national entities are accorded the opportunity to feed into the process  women represent most of the agricultural workforce and are particularly vulnerable as they have limited access to markets and to education which restricts their ability to diversify their income in the event that their primary source of income is affected  these groups include women youths and children people who are physically handicapped indigenous peoples migrants and internally displaced and inhabitants of unfavourable agro-ecological regions  for example higher evaporation rates cause reduced availability of water from surface and groundwaterresources which in turn leads to decreased crop yield and crop failure in agriculture fluctuating availability quality and cost of agricultural raw materials for industry reduced hydro-electric power output from the energysect constrained processing in the miningsect decreased attractiveness of tourism destinations sanitation constraints and increased burden of water-borne diseases for the health sector increased burdens for women as they have to walk long distances and spend more time in search of water for domestic purposes  women and children also more pronouncedly suffer the social consequences of a crisis situation in which protection mechanisms are minimal  men and the able-bodied migrate altering the social structure of communities by leaving women behind and responsible for agricultural production in rural areas  in 2012 only a few women 3 and men 4 were served by other formal financial institutions such as insurance companies  zimbabwe will also implement actions that focus on i increasing resource-use efficiency along the agricultural value chain ii supporting value addition to agricultural products iii improving market access for women and youth farmers in remote areas iv minimizing waste and v reducing inequalities along agricultural value chains  agricultural value-chains largely employ women  supporting women in accessing collateral and finance reducing the burden of work etc  in particular it would reduce sensitivity of women and youth by providing them with the knowledge and skills to maintain agricultural production throughout varying climate and to diversify their sources of income beyond production  as agricultural value-chains largely employ women they are more at risk of unemployment when the industry is exposed  strengthening the resilience of the agriculture industry hence contributes to reducing womens chances of unemployment due to climate change21  as a large number of women are responsible for collecting water for households they lack the time and resources to focus on other income-generating activities  by improving the availability and supply of water this measure would also benefit women directly by reducing their burden associated with fetching water allowing them to access other productive activities  the specific sensitivities and vulnerabilities of young people and women to the impacts of climate change and their essential role in achieving the emissions reductions targets demonstrate their importance as key stakeholders in the achievement of zimbabwes revised ndc  the policy recognises that women are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change  table 9 key institutions for ndc implementation sector name of stakeholder role crosscutting ministry responsible

adaptation plan roadmap third national communication to the unfccc the 2017 system development plan the renewable energy policy biofuels policy revised national gender policy and implementation plan national waterresources master plan draft national agriculture policy framework climate-smart agricultural investment plan national industrial development policy and environmental management act  in 2017 zimbabwe adopted a revised national gender policy that includes a specific thematic area on gender and climate change and promotes the mainstreaming of gender in environmental and climate change policies and strategies  gender issues and intersectionality  intersectionality of gender disability poverty and child-headed households compounds climate change vulnerabilities and is of importance in relation to the principle of leaving no one behind  gender will be mainstreamed throughout the implementation of all adaptation measures  this will ensure that gender-biases are prevented when planning for their implementation and that the measures can also directly target gender inequality as an important factor of vulnerability to climate change  table 2 priority adaptation measures measure 1 develop implement and scale-up climate smart agriculture solutions and strengthen the resilience of agricultural value chains and markets description zimbabwe will promote the use and roll-out of gender sensitive climate-smart agriculture technologies and practices such as land and waterresources conservation sustainable mechanisation agro-ecology water-efficient irrigation renewable energy and energy efficiency climate adapted crop types/varieties and livestock types/breeds crop/livestock diversification agro-forestry integrated pest and disease management post-harvest technologies improved livestock management fodder production and livestock feeding strategies silvi-pastoral systems  implementing this measure thus requires actions that consider gender barriers to accessing information and resources such as lack of collateral illiteracy etc as well as actions that directly address gender inequalities i  measure 4 develop and promote resilient waterresources management description zimbabwe will implement actions which i support the use of best available hydro-climatic information to improve waterresource management waterresource assessment ii explore options to increase watersupply from surface and underground water demand management and wateruse considering gender differences in watersupply and access and iii support the management of extreme events integrated flood management drought management  several mitigation measures included in the revised ndc have adaptation and broader sustainable development co-benefits including but not limited to the following increased uptake of biogas will lead to improved air quality health and gender outcomes  26 the government of zimbabwe recognises that gender equality is central to climate action and a prerequisite for poverty reduction food and nutrition security and sustainable development  as part of the update of the ndc an assessment was made of the potential gender impacts of the policies and measures needed to deliver the mitigation contribution drawing on previous analysis 27 as a result of this analysis the many gender-related benefits of the measures in each sector were highlighted to help zimbabwe plan future policies in a way that mitigates potential negative impacts on gender equality  in particular the issues of youth and gender must be considered integral to the process  co-benefits the measures also offer a range of additional benefits such as enhanced competitiveness through cost reductions especially related to clinker substitution in cement production gender inclusive employment creation along the supply value chain health benefits through improved local air quality and reduced negative impacts on vegetation because of a decrease in associated nox emissions from nitric acid production  co-benefits all of these measures would have multiple benefits beyond the emissions reductions associated with them including gender inclusivity job creation and improved health and air quality  revised national gender policy 2017 includes a specific thematic area on gender and climate change and promotes the mainstreaming of gender in environmental and climate change policies and strategies  beyond national climate policy and nccrs key adaptation policy documents include the nap roadmap the green climate fund country programme zimbabwe climate
