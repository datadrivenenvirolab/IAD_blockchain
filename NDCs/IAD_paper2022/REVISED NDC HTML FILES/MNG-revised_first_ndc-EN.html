<h1>MONGOLIA’S NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION TO THE UNITED NATIONS FRAMEWORK CONVENTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE</h1>

<h2><strong>Overview of Mongolia’s Nationally Determined Contribution</strong></h2>
<p>Mongolia has developed its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), which was approved by the Government Decree No.407 of November 2019, with the aim to contribute to the Paris Agreement. In the NDC, Mongolia has enhanced its mitigation efforts with policies and measures to be implemented in key economic and natural resource management sectors by 2030.</p>
<p>The mitigation target of Mongolia’s NDC will be a 22.7% reduction in total national greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030 (Figure 1), compared to the projected emissions under a business as usual scenario for 2010. In addition, if conditional mitigation measures such as the carbon capture and storage and waste-to-energy technology are implemented, then Mongolia could achieve a 27.2% reduction in total national GHG emissions. Along with that, actions and measures to remove GHG emissions by forest are determined, which set the total mitigation target of Mongolia as 44.9% of GHG emission reduction by 2030.</p>

<p><em>Figure 1. Comparison of BAU baseline GHG emission and mitigation scenarios (Mt СО<sub>2-eq</sub>.)</em></p>
<p>In the development of this NDC, Mongolia re-calculated the baseline emissions up to 2030, which are estimated to reach 74.3 Mt СО<sub>2-eq</sub>. in 2030 without LULUCF, compared to 2015’s INDC baseline of 51.3 Mt СО<sub>2-eq</sub>. The difference between these baseline emissions is primarily due to a variance in the methodology applied for base year emission (Revised 1996 IPCC GLs for INDC and 2006 IPCC GLs for NDC), as well as increasing the number of livestock and additional policy plans in the industrial processing sector, e.g. coal gasification project. This NDC now includes sectors that were not previously considered such as agriculture, waste and some industrial sectors. Under the new baseline, the mitigation target is a 22.7% reduction in total national GHG emissions. Under the 2015 baseline and INDC, the mitigation target was a 14% reduction in total national GHG emissions excluding land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) by 2030.</p>
<p>Adaptation needs and priorities are determined broadly in the NDC, considering the country specific vulnerabilities and climate risks for key socio-economic and natural resource management sectors. Moreover, there is an ongoing project (2018-2021) aimed to develop the national adaptation plan (NAP), and through this effort, the specific adaptation action will be identified. For the development of NAP, Mongolia is taking special consideration of the co-benefits between mitigation and adaptation actions, as well as on nature-based solutions in order to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of response measures to climate change.</p>
<p>By 2030, Mongolia intends to contribute to global efforts to mitigate GHG emissions by implementing the policies and measures listed in Annex 1, facilitating continued international support to complement domestic efforts. The initial estimate of financial needs for this NDC implementation is around US$11.5 billion, of which US$6.3 billion for mitigation, and US$5.2 billion for adaptation.</p>

<td>Implementation and integration of NDC into the national development policy and strategies</td>
<td>
<p>For the achievement of NDC targets, it is imperative to develop a national roadmap, which reflects all actions and measures along with guidelines for sectors and integrate these actions into the Government action program and the national budget.</p>
<p>The integration of NDC targets into the development of policy documents is beneficial to mobilize climate finance and explore international cooperation and support.</p>
<p>One of the advantages of the NDC is that the principle targets presented in the NDC are in line with the national development policy documents such as the Vision-2050, which covers the development framework reflected in the following documents:</p>

<ul>
<li>Green development policy of Mongolia, 2014</li>
<li>National action program on climate change, 2011</li>
<li>Sustainable development vision-2030, 2016</li>
<li>State policy on the energy sector of Mongolia, 2015</li>
<li>State policy on food and agricultural sector, 2010</li>
<li>State policy on forest, 2015</li>
<li>Law on renewable energy, 2015</li>
<li>Law on energy, 2015</li>
<li>National program on energy saving, 2017</li>
</ul>

<p>These national strategy and policy documents, as well as relevant legal instruments define stakeholders’ responsibilities and monitoring structure for implementation of the NDC.</p>
