<h1><strong>Update of Norway's nationally determined contribution </strong></h3>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction </h1>
<p>Norway submitted its intended nationally determined contribution (INDC) to reduce emissions by at least 40 per cent compared to 1990 by 2030 on March 3<sup>rd</sup> 2015. This included accompanying information to facilitate clarity, transparency and understanding, with reference to decisions 1/CP.19 and 1/CP.20. The INDC became Norway's nationally determined contribution (NDC) through Norway's ratification of the Paris agreement on June 20<sup>th</sup> 2016 and the entry into force 4<sup>th</sup> November same year. Norway will cooperate with Iceland and the European Union to fulfil this emission reduction target.</p>
<p><strong>By this submission, Norway updates and enhances its nationally determined contribution under the Paris Agreement to reduce emissions by at least 50 per cent and towards 55 per cent compared to 1990 levels by 2030. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Norway seeks to fulfil the enhanced ambition through the climate cooperation with the European Union. In the event that Norway's enhanced nationally determined contribution goes beyond the target set in the updated nationally determined contribution of the European Union, Norway intends to use voluntary cooperation under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement to fulfil the part that goes beyond what is fulfilled through the climate cooperation with the European Union. Consent of the Parliament will be required. </strong></p>
<p>The climate target of at least 40 per cent reduction in 2030 is established by law in the Norwegian Climate Change Act. The purpose of the act is to promote the implementation of Norway's climate target as part of Norway's process of transforming to a low-emission society by 2050. The climate target for 2030 and implementation of policies and measures to reduce emissions are important steps on the way to become a low-emission society.</p>
<p>Norway has agreed to cooperate with Iceland and European Union to fulfil the target of at least 40 per cent emission reductions by 2030 under the Paris Agreement. By this climate cooperation, the European Union, Iceland and Norway are committed to reduce their overall greenhouse gas emissions, in view of holding the increase in the global average temperature well below 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels.</p>
<p>According to the extended climate cooperation<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> agreed upon with European Union and Iceland, Norway will fulfil their targets of at least 40 per cent greenhouse gas emission reductions for the period 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2030 in accordance with the EU climate framework.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Norway also seeks to fulfil the enhanced ambition through the climate cooperation with the EU.</p>
<h3 id="further-information-necessary-for-clarity-transparency-and-understanding-ictu-of-norways-ndc">Further information necessary for clarity, transparency and understanding (ICTU) of Norway's NDC </h3>
<p>Norway has used the guidance on information to provide clarity, transparency and understanding in Decision 4/CMA.1 for information provided in the Annex to this submission, as applicable to its nationally determined contribution.</p>
<p>Further information to facilitate clarity, transparency and understanding for the enhanced nationally determined contribution may be provided at a later date, when there is more clarity on the updated nationally determined contribution and of the European Union.</p>

<p>The strategy for implementation was approved by the Parliament 26<sup>th</sup> April 2018. The Government is further developing policies and measures to fulfil the target.</p>
<p>For the enhanced target the Government has communicated to the Parliament through various documents that it intends to update and enhance its climate target for 2030.</p>
<p>Economic measures like CO<sub>2</sub>- taxes and emission trading are central to Norwegian climate policy. Support for the development and adoption of low emissions technologies, including carbon capture and storage technologies and electric vehicles as well as policies for renewable energy are also important in Norwegian climate policy.

<td>Institutional arrangements: the emission reduction target for 2030 was established through interministerial processes.</p>
<p>Through the climate cooperation with the European Union and Iceland, Norway will have specific legislation for the period 2021-2030 covering all emissions and sectors:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The EU Emission Trading System (ETS) regulates emissions from industrial plants, power plants, the petroleum industry and commercial aviation within the European Economic Area. About half of Norwegian greenhouse gas emissions are covered by the ETS. Norway has been a part of the ETS since 2008 on the same terms as EU Member States.</p></li>
<li><p>The Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR) regulates emissions from transport, agriculture, buildings and waste management and emissions from industry and petroleum not covered by the ETS. The Effort Sharing Regulation sets binding national targets. Norway's national target is to reduce emissions in the non-ETS-sectors by 40 per cent in 2030 compared to 2005.The target can be fulfilled through domestic emission reductions and/or by use of flexible mechanisms within the EU framework.</p></li>
<li><p>The Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) Regulation regulates emissions and removals for the land use, land use change and forestry sector. As for the EU Member States, Norway's commitment is to ensure that emissions do not exceed removals in this sector.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Ministry of Climate and Environment has the overarching cross-sectoral responsibility for coordination and implementation. The Ministry of Finance is responsible for the tax schemes and the other ministries are responsible for policies in their respective sectors. Further details on institutional arrangements are found in Norway's 7<sup>th</sup> National Communication, Chapter 4.1.3.</p>
<p>The Environmental Information Act, implementing the Aarhus Convention, establish public participation in decision making processes relevant for the environment. Consequently, the Climate Change Act was on a public hearing including all stakeholders. For consultations with indigenous people, Sami People, procedures for consultation processes between the central government and the Sámediggi, established in 2005, constitute a crucial framework for ensuring Sami rights under international law to participate in processes that may affect them.</p></td>

This serves, amongst others, to stabilize the economy and work life in periods of transition. It is a priority for the Government to facilitate the creation of profitable green jobs through pricing, public procurement, regulations and measures that supports technology development.</p>
  <p><em>Human Rights</em>: Human rights are enshrined in the The Norwegian Constitution. The Human Rights Act establishes the main conventions on human rights as Norwegian law. This act prevail over other Norwegian legislation in case of conflicts between norms.</p>
  <p><em>Indigenous People</em>: ref above 4 (a) (i)</p>
  <p><em>Food security:</em> There is a scarcity of agricultural land in Norway especially suitable for arable crops. Norway's role in global food security in the context of climate change is to adapt to a changing climate, manage and use these resources sustainably, to secure food supplies while emissions of greenhouse gases are reduced.</p>
  <p><em>Gender equality:</em> In 2018, a new and comprehensive Equality and Anti-Discrimination Act entered into force. The Act's purpose is to promote gender equality. The Act provides protection against discrimination on the basis of gender, pregnancy, leave in connection with birth or adoption and care responsibilities. Women and men are to be given equal opportunities in education and work, and in their cultural and professional development.</p>
  <p>General and sector specific legislation, support, taxation and other measures are in place to protect and avoid, reduce or manage adverse impacts on climate and environment and provide for broad access to information participation and justice.

<td>How the Party considers that its nationally determined contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its national circumstances;</td>
<td><p>Norway's approach to consider fairness and ambition is to assess how its nationally determine contribution contributes to meeting the global long-term goal of the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>The scientific basis for such an assessment is the recent IPCC reports. The 5th Assessment Report shows that scenarios that are likely to limit global warming below 2°C require that global emissions must be reduced by 40 to 70% by 2050 compared to 2010 levels.</p>
<p>The IPCC special report on the impacts of global warming of 1,5°C shows pathways that limit global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot. They describe a 40 - 50 % reduction in net anthropogenic GHG emissions by 2030 compared to 2010 levels, and net anthropogenic CO2 emissions reaching net zero around 2050 (2045 – 2055) accompanied by the reductions in nonCO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>

<p>It is an ambitious target for Norway to achieve by 2030. Norway has considered how to increase ambition, and Norway believes the strongest way of doing this is to do on a European basis, together with the European Union. The achievement of the target is dependent on a broad set of mitigation measures. The implementation of the enhanced NDC for 2030 will be an important part of Norway's process of transforming to a low-emission society by 2050.</td>
