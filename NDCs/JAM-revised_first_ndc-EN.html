<p><strong>UPDATE OF NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION (NDC) OF JAMAICA to the UNITED NATIONS FRAMEWORK CONVENTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE (UNFCCC)</strong></p>

<p> June 2020 </p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Jamaica remains committed to making its contribution as the world moves to address the challenge of climate change. In line with requirements of the Paris Agreement, the country has increased its ambition of the mitigation component of its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC). This increase in ambition comprises both a broadening of the NDC’s sectoral scope and the delivery of greater emission reductions.</p></li>
<li><p>Jamaica has broadened its sectoral scope and taken steps to move towards an economy-wide target and will bring emissions from the land use change and forestry sector within its NDC for the first time. This reflects the importance of the forestry sector to Jamaica, which accounts for more than half of the island’s total land use, and the important commitments that the country has made to preserve and enhance these stocks.</p></li>
<li><p>The country has identified opportunities to deepen the emission reductions it delivers in the energy sector. These opportunities are part of an increasingly comprehensive approach to decarbonising this sector that covers both the electricity generation, as well as energy use sub-sectors.</p></li>
<li><p>The result of these positive changes is that Jamaica’s latest NDC will be significantly more ambitious. By 2030, it foresees emission reductions covering these two sectors of between 25.4 per cent (unconditional) and 28.5 per cent (conditional) relative to a business-as-usual scenario (which takes into account policies in place as of 2005). This implies that emissions in these sectors would be 1.8 to 2.0 MtCO2e lower than they otherwise be, compared with a range of 1.1 to 1.5 MtCO2e in its previous NDC.</p></li>
<li><p>A crucial feature of Jamaica’s NDC is that it is based on the analytical work of the policies and grounded ambitious commitments that the country has already made. This ensures that the commitments are robust, benefiting from both political support and implementation plans already in place. This approach is crucial in both ensuring the legitimacy of Jamaica’s NDC to domestic constituents and in enhancing the credibility of the international process governing emission reductions.</p></li>
<li><p>As a small island developing state, Jamaica is acutely aware of how the physical risks of climate change threaten its development and the wellbeing and economic security of its citizens. Adaptation represents an important cross-cutting element for all sectors. Within the energy and land-use sectors, the policies in place to reduce emissions will also provide adaptation cobenefits to Jamaica and therefore enhance the country’s resilience. For example, a shift to cleaner energy in the energy sector will reduce local air pollution and therefore benefit human health. This problem will otherwise be more severe as temperatures increase. Similarly, the preservation of the forest cover will improve water, soil and air quality, and reduce soil erosion.</p></li>
<li><p>All relevant GHG gases were accounted for using the IPCC 2006 Guidelines for the National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and IPCC 2013 Wetlands Supplement.</p></li>
<li><p>Jamaica has opted to update its NDC in the information to facilitate clarity, transparency and understanding (ICTU) guidance template made available following discussions that framed the Katowice Rulebook at the twenty-fourth meeting of the Conference of Parties (COP 24).</p></li>
<li><p>Moving forward, Jamaica is committed to delivering on this NDC in keeping with its commitments as a Party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. Jamaica welcomes the support of the international community as the country pursues these ambitious goals to consolidate its efforts to delink economic growth and development from emissions growth, while also making itself more climate-resilient.</p></li>

<td>
<p>Jamaica will undertake a range of actions concerning the sectors not covered by its quantitative commitments. These include the following:</p>
<p>
<strong>Agriculture:</strong> The Climate Change Policy Framework for Jamaica (2015) identifies the agriculture sector as a critical sector of importance for both mitigation and adaptation. Strategic aims include facilitating the use of water (and hence energy) efficient agricultural methods, improved food storage systems, and diversifying food production techniques including the expansion of agroforestry and aquaculture.</p>
<p>
Consistent with these strategic priorities, several important ongoing important projects in the sector are contributing to both GHG emissions reductions, carbon sequestration and enhanced climate resilience. For example, the Integrated Management of the Yallahs and Hope River Watershed Management Areas (Yallahs-Hope) Project, aims to improve the conservation and management of biodiversity and the provision of ecosystem services within the region; the watersheds accounts for around 7% of the island’s farmlands. This will be done by implementing sustainable agriculture (including renewable power generation), forestry, land management and livelihood practices within targeted communities. An initial estimate suggests that the avoided deforestation, reforestation and sustainable land management outcomes of the project could yield emission reductions of more than 550,000tCO2e for the 4 years of the project.</p>
<p>Other projects expected to contribute to low-emissions development in the agriculture sector include The Essex Valley Agriculture Development Project, and a project focused on Promoting CommunityBased Climate Resilience in the Fisheries Sector.</p>
<p><strong>Waste:</strong> Jamaica has introduced a single-use plastics ban. Since the start of 2019, the government has imposed a ban on the importation, manufacture, distribution and use of single-use plastic bags (of certain sizes) as well as plastic straws. From January 2019, there has been a ban on the importation of polystyrene foam (‘Styrofoam’) for use in the food and drink industry, while from the start of 2020, the ban was extended to cover the domestic manufacture of these items as well. The ban is complemented by a Plastic Waste Minimisation project.</p>
<p>
In addition, the country is currently developing proposals for a countrywide Integrated Waste Management (IWM) PPP concession which is expected to improve the management and reduce the emissions of the waste sector.</p>
<p>
The country is also undertaking a range of pilot projects to explore biodiesel from cooking oil, the production of biogas using animal waste and increasing the use of biodigestors.</p></td>

<p>
Jamaica conducted a detailed assessment to determine whether other sources and sinks of emissions could be included within its updated NDC but concluded that the data needed to rigorously assess the impact of policies and actions on emissions in other sectors was not available.

geography, climate, economy, sustainable development, and poverty eradication; </ul></ul></td>

<td><p><strong><span class="underline">Geography:</span></strong> Jamaica is a small island developing state in the Caribbean and highly dependent on natural resources. Its geographical location and biophysical landscape make it vulnerable to climate change impacts, especially for coastal sectors where persons depend on livelihood activities.
</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="underline">Climate</span></strong><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a><strong><span class="underline">:</span></strong> Jamaica has a tropical climate which is influenced by the Northeast Trade Winds and its geography, including mountains and hills. Average temperatures historically range from 24-27°C, varying according to elevation and proximity to the coast. The country has a bimodal rainfall pattern, typically peaking in May and October. The late rainfall season typically receives the largest volume of rainfall. Wind speeds tend to be highest during the drier months.</p>
<p>
The country is already experiencing the effects of climate change. There is an overall decline in annual rainfall, though there are spatial differences; rainfall is increasing over the centre of the island and decreasing rainfall over the eastern and western parishes leading to prolonged drier periods and more frequent and intense droughts in
these areas. The country is already managing the consequences of sea level rise.</p>
<p>
In the future, the trends observed in Jamaica’s climate will become more pronounced. Downscaled models show that temperatures continue to increase, including in the short to medium terms. Temperatures could increase by 0.82°C to 3.09°C by 2081 to 2100. The models also show a drying trend which is more pronounced in some sections of the island from the 2020s and being more extensive and intense by the 2030s when drying may be up to ~30%. Sea level rise will continue while hurricanes are expected to become less frequent but more intense.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="underline">Economy:</span></strong> Jamaica is an upper-middle-income country that has nonetheless faced significant problems in the recent past due both to its vulnerability to natural disasters (many of which are climate-related) as well as other structural challenges. Its key economic areas include services industry (of which tourism is a part), as well as mining and quarrying sector. During 2020, the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the tourism sector has been significant which has also had a ripple effect on rural livelihoods which rely predominantly on the climatesensitive fisheries and agriculture sectors.
</p>
<p>
In the recent past, Jamaica has been heavily focused on improving its macroeconomic fundamentals with a strong focus on reducing its public debt, controlling inflation, and reducing unemployment. These improvements have been characterized as an international success but are now threatened by the global fallout from the COVID 19 pandemic.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="underline">Sustainable development:</span></strong> Vision 2030 Jamaica – National Development Plan, and its Medium-Term Socio-Economic Policy Framework (2018-2021) are underpinned by the three dimensions of sustainable development – social, economic and environmental – as well as equity and inclusiveness. It has made a strong national commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with assessments indicating a more than 90% alignment between Vision 2030 Jamaica and the SDGs. Besides climate action (SDG 13), Jamaica is making particularly substantial progress on health and well-being (SDG 3), quality education (SDG 4), and gender equality (SDG 5).
</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="underline">Poverty eradication:</span></strong> Through the National Policy on Poverty and National Poverty Reduction Programme, Jamaica is actively seeking to end or significantly reduce poverty in all forms. This is complemented by a Social Protection Strategy and creating an enabling environment for businesses and economic activities to grow while increasingly putting in place measures to safeguard natural resources<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. Data<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> shows that poverty has fluctuated over the past decade and remains highest in rural areas. The government’s commitment to addressing poverty is reflected in its NDC through, for example, recognising the importance of increased agricultural production, the sustainable management of forest resources and the implementation of adaptation measures. Jamaica aims to move towards the eradication of poverty while simultaneously contributing to reducing global emissions.

<td><p>A commitment to reducing GHG emission levels nationally will require cleaner technologies, expertise and financing.
</p>
<p><strong>Technology</strong>: The need for new innovations are embedded in the need to be more efficient and to produce from cleaner technologies. The availability and transfer of technologies that are environmentally sound and which support low carbon and climate-resilient development is paramount. As a small island developing state these opportunities are not often readily accessible and so the spirit of the Paris Agreement would help to foster North-South Cooperation.</p>
<p>
<strong>Expertise</strong>: The integration and transformation of new ideas and technologies into the economy, society and environment will take some capacity development for their appropriate applicability and proliferation.</p>
<p>
<strong>Financing</strong>: Technology transfer and capacity development cannot take place without sufficient financial resources made available to undertake the transition. As an indebted and highly vulnerable state to the impact of climate change, it is important to find the right balance in building the country’s resilience and in implementing the necessary adaptation and mitigation measures, while supporting the day to day needs of the country. The measures necessary to effect the transition are cost-intensive.</p></td>

<p>The baseline for assessing emission reduction from land use change and forestry was determined using Jamaica’s 2013 Land Use Change Assessment. Projections for land-use change for the period to 2030 in the baseline take account of the historical trends reported in this document as well as Jamaica’s agricultural production targets as set out in Vision 2030 Jamaica. The analysis then calculates how land-use patterns will change as a result of key policies (no net loss of forest cover, tree planting). Changes in land use are then aligned with emissions factors from the IPCC’s Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories to estimate the implications these changes have for both emissions and removals.</p>
<p>The baseline emissions in the energy sector were calculated using the Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning System (LEAP) model. This combines demographic and economic growth projections from the Statistical Institute of Jamaica, the UN World Population Prospects and the World Bank, to develop a business-as-usual forecast for energy sectors emissions given the policies that were in place in Jamaica as of 2005. GDP is assumed to grow at around 2% per annum between 2019 and 2030, based on IMF projections. Gradual population growth is also expected, from 2.7m in 2018 to 2.8m in 2030, based on historical data from the Statistical Institute of Jamaica and projections from the UN.</p>

<td rowspan="2"><p>
Jamaica’s updated NDC reflects its strong commitment to the implementation of the Paris Agreement. It will be subject to all relevant laws, guidelines, policies and programmes which are designed to increase inclusiveness and fairness, including the Code of Consultations and the National Policy for Gender Equity.</p>
<p>
  As set out below, the updated NDC is considerably more ambitious than its first. Despite being a developing country and a SIDS, under this NDC,and given current expectations, within the covered sectors, Jamaica will move closer to decoupling economic growth from its emissions profile. Over the ten years between 2020 and 2030, emissions are projected to only grow very slightly within the sectors covered by its NDC, despite expected continued growth of the economy.
</p>
<p>
  The country’s emissions per capita will remain substantially lower than the global average.

<td>c. How the Party has addressed <strong>Article 4, paragraph 3</strong>, of the Paris Agreement;</td>
<td rowspan="3"><p>
Jamaica’s revised NDC represents a significant enhancement on its first NDC.</p>
<p>Jamaica is taking steps to move towards an economy-wide target and has brought emissions from the land use change and forestry sector within its NDC for the first time. This reflects the importance of the forestry sector to Jamaica, which accounts for more than half of the island’s total land use, and the important commitments that the country has made to preserve and enhance these stocks.
</p>
<p>The country has also identified opportunities to deepen the emission reductions it delivers in the energy sector. These opportunities are part of an increasingly comprehensive approach to decarbonising this sector that covers both the electricity generation, as well as energy use subsectors.
</p>
<p>The result of these positive changes is that Jamaica’s latest NDC will approximately double in ambition. By 2030, the emission reductions in these two sectors of between 25.4 per cent (unconditional) and 28.5 per cent (conditional) implies that emissions in these sectors would be 1.8 to 2.0 MtCO2e lower than in the BAU scenario. This compares with a range of 1.1 to 1.5 MtCO2e in its previous NDC. This implies that the absolute level of ambition in Jamaica’s unconditional commitment has increased by more than 60% when comparing the First NDC and the updated NDC.
</p>
<p>Jamaica has also prepared its NDC following ICTU guidance to provide information to facilitate clarity, transparency and understanding.</p>

In 2015, Jamaica’s per capita GHG emissions were just 3.6 tCO2e per person, fully 45% below the global average of 6.6 tCO2e. Despite this low starting point, the country is now proposing an NDC that, under current projections, is consistent with virtually decoupling its economic growth from its covered emissions. As such, despite being a developing country, Jamaica is playing its part in global emissions peaking as soon as possible, as set out under Article 4.1 of the Paris Agreement.
