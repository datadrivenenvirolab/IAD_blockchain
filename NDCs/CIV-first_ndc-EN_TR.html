<p>After a decade of politico-military crisis that has led to a deep social divide, Côte d'Ivoire has set itself the goal of becoming an emerging country by 2020. To stimulate and coordinate the many facets of its development, the Côte d'Ivoire has returned to its planning tradition.</p>
<p>The country has also returned to rapid growth (in the order of 8% per year), in a context of peace. Populations are also beginning to take advantage of the renewed dynamism, thanks to efforts to redistribute and correct the inequalities achieved in the different sectors.</p>
<p>The 2016-2020 NDP currently being finalized to consolidate this trajectory towards emergence and industrialization. This planning is part of a longer-term vision. The National Prospective Study "Ivory Coast 2040" is also being finalized.</p>
<p>The country 's national development strategy combined with high population growth would lead to a substantial increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In addition, Côte d'Ivoire is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.</p>
<p>To meet these challenges, in 2012, Côte d'Ivoire set up the National Climate Change Program (NCCP) to coordinate, propose and promote measures and strategies in the fight against climate change. A National Strategy for Combating Climate Change 2015-2020 was adopted at the end of 2014.</p>
<p>Through this Nationally Determined Planned Contribution (INDC), Ivory Coast, the United States seeks to reduce its carbon footprint by favoring mitigation options with high "co-benefits" (Section 2: Mitigation); strengthen the country's resilience to climate change (Section 3: Adaptation); bring coherence to its sectoral policies and strengthen its mechanism and implementation tools to facilitate the achievement of these objectives (Section 4); and mobilize for this purpose, including funding, both national and international (Section 5).</p>
<h2 id="Atténuation">2. Mitigation</h2>
<h3 id="contribution">2.1. Contribution of Ivory Coast</h3>
<p>While taking into account the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, Ivory Coast, as African economies face the challenge of development to improve the quality of life of its population. The growing need for this development, which includes increasing agricultural production, agro-industrial processing, the fight against deforestation and the continuation or even the acceleration of the supply of modern energy to all inhabitants, does not undermine the country's political will to contribute to the reduction of GHG emissions. However, Côte d'Ivoire needs to be supported to pursue the path of sustainable development, respectful of the environment and concerned about the challenges of climate change.</p>
<p>The INDCs of Côte d'Ivoire are therefore a contribution based on the development of the sectoral development strategies providing for the support of the technical and financial partners.</p>
