<h1>Thailand's Updated Nationally Determined Contribution</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>

<p>As a developing country highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, Thailand attaches great importance to the global efforts to address this common and pressing challenge. Pursuant to decision l/CP.21, Thailand hereby communicates its updated nationally determined contribution (NDC) and the relevant information, described in the annex of the decision 4/CMA. l, as applicable.</p>

<h2 id="mitigation-component">2. Mitigation Component</h2>
<p>Thailand intends to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent from the projected business-as-usual (BAU) level by 2030. The level of contribution could increase up to 25 percent, subject to adequate and enhanced access to technology development and transfer, financial resources and capacity building support. Thailand is formulating its Long-term Low Greenhouse Gas Emission Development Strategy (LT-LEDS) which will guide Thailand towards a climate-resilient and low greenhouse gas emissions development and serve as a basis for enhancing its subsequent NDCs.</p>

<tr><td><strong>Planning processes</strong></td>
<td>  To ensure that the NDC is realistic and achievable, its preparation was fundamentally based on the linkage between climate action and national development priorities, including social and economic development and poverty eradication. Integration of NDC into country strategies, long-term economic and social development plans, sectoral plans, and local plans is essential to secure successful implementation and contribution.</p>

<p><strong>NDC Preparation:</strong></p>

<p>Thailand's NDC was developed through a participatory process. Stakeholder consultations were conducted through the establishment of an inter-ministerial working group and steering committee comprising representatives from relevant sectoral agencies, academia, and the private sector. The NDC was formulated based on the following plans:</p>

<ul>
<li>12<sup>th</sup> National Economic and Social Development Plan 2017-2021</li>
<li>Climate Change Master Plan B.E. 2558-2593 (2015-2050) </li>
<li>Power Development Plan B.E. 2558-2579 (2015-2036)</li>
<li>Thailand Smart Grid Development Master Plan B.E. 2558-2579 (2015-2036)</li>
<li>Energy Efficiency Plan B.E. 2558-2579 (2015-2036)</li>
<li>Alternative Energy Development Plan B.E. 2558-2579 (2015-2036) </li>
<li>Environmentally Sustainable Transport System Plan B.E.2556-2573 (2013-2030)</li>
<li>National Industrial Development Master Plan B.E.2555-2574 (2012-2031)</li>
<li>Waste Management Roadmap</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Implementation Plans:</strong></p>

<p>Thailand's NDC target has been integrated into the National Strategy. It will be implemented through the NDC Roadmap on Mitigation 2021-2030, the NDC Sectoral Action Plans and the NDC Supportive Action Plan which were carried out with a wide range of stakeholders consultation and public participation processes at the national and local levels. The NDC Roadmap identifies key measures and allocates emission reduction targets and responsibilities to relevant agencies in energy, transport, industry, and waste management sectors. The NDC Sectoral Action Plans further identifies emission reduction targets in each measure. The NDC Supportive Action Plan highlights gaps and needs to enhance enabling environment to support NDC implementation.</p>

<h3>2.2 Consideration on fairness and ambition in light of national circumstances</h3>
<h4>2.2.1 Thailand's national circumstances</h4>
<p>Thailand is a developing country highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and is ranked the 13<sup>th</sup> country in the "extreme risk" category<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> that is most vulnerable to future climate change impacts over the next thirty years. Thailand's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions represent 0.77% of global emissions in 2014, which is lower than world average. In terms of emission profile, the energy sector has been the largest contributor to Thailand's GHG emission, accounting for 74% of total emission in 2013, as reflected in the country's 3<sup>rd</sup> National Communication.</p>
<h4>2.2.2 Thailand's efforts</h4>
<p>Thailand places high priority on climate change as one of the key challenges affecting communities' livelihood, economic growth and the achievement of sustainable development. Thailand has incorporated climate change into its national economic and social development plans since 2007. Climate change is currently addressed at the highest policy level under the National Strategy (2018-2037) to ensure a long-term continuity of the issue alongside other economic and social considerations, including poverty eradication. The Climate Change Master Plan 2015-2050 reflects on climate change mitigation, adaptation, capacity building and cross-cutting issues. Ambitious energy targets are put forward in the Power Development Plan (PDP), the Alternative Energy Development Plan (AEDP) and the Energy Efficiency Plan (EEP). The Environmentally Sustainable Transport System Plan promotes road-to-rail modal shift for both freight and passenger transport. A vehicle tax scheme based on C02 emission was introduced in 2016 to promote low carbon vehicles. The Waste Management Roadmap promotes waste-to-energy technologies and also actively implements 3Rs principle.</p>
<p>Thailand's NAMAs target to reduce GHG emission by 7-20% by 2020 below business-as-usual (BAU) includes measures in energy and transport sectors. Under NAMAs, we have achieved a GHG emission reduction of 14.09% in 2017 which lays a solid foundation for our post-2020 efforts. Moreover, Thailand is in the process of formulating its Long-term Low Greenhouse Gas Emission Development Strategy (LT-LEDS).</p>
<p>In addition to mitigation efforts, Thailand has placed adaptation as equally important. Thailand has developed our first National Adaptation Plan to provide a framework towards climate-resilient society with the focus on water management, agriculture and food security, tourism, health, natural resource management, and human settlement and security.</p>



<p>The NAP aims to minimize risks and vulnerability as well as to improve resilience of the country in accordance with sustainable development pathway. Thailand has integrated climate change adaptation into key sectoral policies and plans such as the Strategy for Climate Change in Agriculture (2017- 2021), the Climate Change Adaptation Plan on Public Health (2018-2030), the 20-year Water Resource Management Master Plan, and the Spatial Plans.</p>
<h4>2.2.3 Thailand's challenges and limitations</h4>
<p>It is important to incorporate concerns that several of the proposed measures and actions in these ambitious plans are subject to very high investment and operating costs, particularly costs of technologies and infrastructures which can become an important barrier to successful implementation of the plans.</p>
<p>Some of the key barriers for the energy sector include, for instance, limitation of grid connection due to inadequate capacity of transmission lines, lack of support by financial institutions for energy efficiency and renewable energy investments, lack of domestic technological and technical resources and negative public perception particularly against waste-to-energy and biomass power plants. Several measures require a high level of technical capacity and effective coordination across different sectoral agencies, whereas such technical capacity and effective coordination in a developing country like Thailand is currently lacking. For renewable energy development in particular, the International Energy Agency also cited some of the above-mentioned barriers as common barriers for renewable energy deployment in developing countries. Domestically, Thailand has launched several support mechanisms such as feed-in tariffs, tax incentives and access to investment grants and venture capital to promote renewable energy. However, to achieve ambitious and more rapid renewable energy deployment, incentives have to be created for technology developers to cooperate and share technology knowledge to enable technology transfer on a larger scale. International financial support mechanisms such as technical assistance and technology transfer funds for purchasing intellectual property rights for a free distribution of clean energy technologies would be very valuable to accelerate diffusion of renewable energy technologies for developing countries.</p>
<p>Furthermore, efforts are needed to inform the public, through lessons-learned and experience sharing from other countries, as well as showcasing success stories from pilot or demonstration projects. It is therefore crucial that international cooperation through the UNFCCC focuses on these cooperative attempts to unlock the potentials of developing countries in their contributions towards the global solutions to climate change by addressing these important identified barriers, making technological solutions more affordable for developing countries and strengthening the capacity of developing countries to implement these solutions more effectively and more sustainably. Successful implementation of these ambitious mitigation plans in Thailand, in addition to our domestic efforts, will be subject to adequate and predictable access to enhanced means of implementation agreed under the UNFCCC.</p>

<h2 id="adaptation-component">3. Adaptation Component</h2>

<p>Thailand has developed the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) with the aims to build adaptive capacity and enhance climate resilience in 6 priority sectors including water resources management, agriculture and food security, tourism, public health, natural resources management, and human settlements and security.</p>

<h2>4. Support Needs</h2>

<p>Climate change adaptation and mitigation are becoming more deeply embedded in governmental structures in line with the increasing profile of climate actions in national agendas. Thailand has established the inter-ministerial committees to oversee climate policy development and implementation and comprehensive national systems to monitor, evaluate and report on progress. However, there are still gaps in individual and institutional capacities in all relevant agencies, including governmental agencies, private sectors, and general public. The provision of support and cooperation on climate actions are important to achieving mitigation and adaptation objectives and increasing ambition.</p>
<p>Various challenges were identified during NDC and NAP preparation such as uncertainties of climate change and its impacts, lack of data and researches on coping capacities and vulnerabilities in sectors and local area, lack of tools and methods to support implementation, and a lot of institutional barriers to encompass sectoral and political boundaries. Moreover, the global outbreak of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has dramatically threatened the way people conduct their daily life. The so-called "New Normal" that emerges after the pandemic will reshape many economic and social activities. As Thailand plans its recovery from this pandemic, we aim to use this opportunity to build back better an ecosystem and economy that promotes climate-resilient and sustainable development, including through the implementation of NDC. To meet this transition, supports namely financial, technology development and transfer, and capacity building, in the following areas are very crucial to drive effective and realistic implementation of Thailand's NDC.</p>
