<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Country No Annex 1 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Mauritania belongs to the African Sahel zone most affected by recurrent droughts since 1968. The resulting desertification is all the stronger, The effect of climate, combined with human action, has had direct consequences on an already precarious environment, namely the deterioration of the general socio-economic conditions of the country and of the physical environment. The country's vulnerability to climate change therefore affects all vital sectors of the national economy.</p>
<p>In response to the recurring disasters resulting from this situation, the Government of Mauritania regularly devotes part of its budget to special programs to assist vulnerable populations affected by droughts. This is the case of the Emel (Espoir) program, which is being implemented, for an initial financial allocation of <em><strong>42 billion MRO</strong></em> in 2012 and a revolving financing of <em><strong>12 billion MRO</strong></em> per year, ie a cumulative financing of <em><strong>78 billion MRO</strong></em> for The period 2012 - 2015, about <em><strong>300 million US</strong></em> dollars, This emergency program comes just after the 2011 Solidarity Emergency Program, which cost nine billion MROs, or about <em><strong>35 million US dollars</strong></em>.</p>
<p>The '' Nationally Determined Contribution Determined at the National Level '' of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania is based on sectoral development programs and the strategic framework for poverty reduction. Their overall objective is to contribute to sustainable development, which is low carbon and resilient to the impacts of climate change.</p>
<p>In light of the above, this contribution reflects both the political will of the country to participate in the global reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and to meet the adaptation needs of the country, To the extent of its means and capacities</p>
<h2 id="methodological-approach">1- Methodological approach</h2>
<p>As part of the preparation of the CPDN, ​​the Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable Development (MEDD) proceeded in three stages: a first stage of sensitization / information, a second stage of elaboration of the Contribution and finally a third stage of confirmation. In this process, two components were considered, the political and technical aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>For the political part, the message on the stakes and challenges of COP21 and the National Contribution was relayed to all key sectors by the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development. This action allowed to define the practical modalities of the preparation of sectoral contributions by teams, each coordinated by a sectoral focal point. The process of developing the CPDN was also to be completed by political validation marked by Government approval.</li>

<h3 id="methodologies-for-mitigation-assessment">1.1 - Methodologies for Mitigation Assessment</h3>
<p>For the analysis of mitigation in Mauritania, three models were used in the calculation of the estimates:</p>
<ul>
<li>The methodologies of the IPCC 2006 Guidelines and the associated software for the Energy, Industrial Processes and Product Use (PIUP) and Waste 'sectors;</li>
<li>The FAO Ex-Ante Carbon-balance Tool (EX-ACT) for the AFAT sector</li>
<li>The LEAP model for the analysis of the domestic energy sub-sector.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="methodologies-for-assessing-adaptation-options">1.2 - Methodologies for assessing adaptation options</h3>
<p>Based on the guidelines (Climate and socio-economic scenarios) and support (joint vulnerability and adaptation) of the MEDD multidisciplinary team of experts, the development sectors proposed their respective climate change adaptation portfolios</p>

<p>Mauritania ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1994 and acceded to the Kyoto Protocol in 1997. At the national level, the National Sustainable Development Strategy (NSSD) by 2015, October 2006 constitutes the reference framework for national policy related to climate issues. Operationally, it is articulated with the Second National Action Plan for Environment and Sustainable Development (NAPE II) covering the period 2012-16. Long before, Mauritania drew up its National Adaptation Plan for Climate Change (NAPA) in 2004. In 2015, Mauritania launched the first preparatory milestones of its National Adaptation Plan with medium and long-term vision.</p>

<h3 id="mitigation-funding-needs">3.6 - Mitigation funding needs</h3>
<p>Implementation of the proposed mitigation projects requires capacity, technology, regulatory and institutional frameworks, and financial means. Given its current capacity, only a counterpart of these projects can be provided by Mauritania's own resources.</p>
<p>To achieve its GHG mitigation ambitions in 2030, Mauritania will need an overall financial package of <strong>US $ 9.3 billion</strong>, of which 88% (equivalent to <strong>US $ 8.2 billion</strong>) from international support.</p>
<p>In addition to this direct financial support, Mauritania would like to support its funding needs for mitigation through: (i) the NAMA platform, in particular for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs; (Ii) the inclusion of international carbon markets, such as the CDM, in a post-2020 climate agreement that, coupled with an appropriate accounting regime (MRV), could be used to finance low-carbon investments.</p>
<h2 id="mauritanias-adaptation-contribution">4 - Mauritania's Adaptation Contribution</h2>
<p>According to the climate scenarios reported in the Third National Communication (2014), Mauritania, should have a strong socio-economic and ecological exposure to the impacts of climate change:</p>
<p><em><strong>Temperature</strong></em>. An increase of +2.1 ° C in the average annual temperature throughout the country by 2050 and + 4.5 ° by 2100.</p>
<p><em><strong>Precipitation</strong></em>. A reduction in the annual volume of precipitation from 20% in regions to 70% in Adrar, compared to the current situation, by 2100.</p>
<p><em><strong>Extreme phenomena</strong></em>. This increase in temperature and decrease in precipitation would be accompanied by an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme drought and flood events and disturbances in the seasonal distribution of precipitation.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sea level rise</strong></em>. The coastline, which extends over more than 720 km of coastline, already shows its sensitivity to the phenomenon of sea-level rise in some places (Nouakchott). Built areas of the capital and the smallest precipitation makes drainage and sanitation generally impossible.</p>
<h3 id="the-impacts-of-climate-change-in-key-sectors">4.1 - The impacts of climate change in key sectors</h3>
<p>Impacts on water resources will be significant and will result in a general decline in water resources in the order of 10 to 15%, with the following consequences:</p>
<ul>
<li>The increase in mean sea surface temperature (SST) with a northward rise of the thermal front beyond its usual geographic boundary and oxygen depletion creates more and more OMZs which could be the source of migration of pelagic species to areas rich in oxygen;</li>
<li>The increase in water temperature and the acidification of the oceans over the last years seem to be accompanied by a multiplication of jellyfish and a recurrent phenomenon of colored waters;</li>
<li>Rising ocean levels and coastal erosion threatening the coastal infrastructure dedicated to fishing;</li>
<li>Increased frequency of storms that reduces fishing productivity.</li>
<li>A dysregulation of the wadis regime and a reduction in the filling capacity of dams due to concentrated precipitation and the accelerated siltation of dams by water erosion in heavily denuded watersheds and,</li>
<li>A warming of the less aerated surface waters at lower flow rates and thus a reduction in their powers of dilution and biodegradation of certain pollutants, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>The impacts on livestock</strong></em> will result in a worsening of the current situation, marked by the degradation of livestock productivity. This change in livestock productivity is induced by recurrent droughts, scarcity and distance from pastoral areas and water points. This situation is the result of global warming and abnormal biomass withdrawals that significantly affect the already very fragile level of food insecurity. The convergence of these different factors affects the way in which herds are managed, with in particular the development of peri-urban farming and the implementation of breed improvement programs.</p>
<p><em><strong>Impacts on habitat, urban planning and spatial planning</strong></em> concern the risks of intrusion of marine waters and flooding of coastal infrastructures and cities, including Nouakchott and Nouadhibou, respectively political and economic capitals. Indeed, coastal areas in Mauritania are home to more than 30% of the country's population, most industries, most import-export activities, major port and airport infrastructure, Extraction of hydrocarbons, almost all fishing activities, but also the two major national parks of the country. With rising sea levels on the one hand, and coastal topography, on the other hand, coastal areas are significantly vulnerable to the risks of marine incursions and floods and Extreme climatic events. To this end, climatic disasters affecting the coastal zone will affect the economic growth of Mauritania, a country where the coastline represents both a singular ecosystem and the main pole of economic development. On the other hand, the risk of silting up towns and villages, combined with droughts, leads to the concentration of populations around wetlands, the fragmentation of human settlements along the roads and the big cities</p>
<p><em><strong>Impacts on natural resources</strong></em>. The regression of vegetation cover (woody and herbaceous), under the combined effect of chronic droughts and anthropogenic pressure, has accentuated desertification and has been the main cause of the disappearance of forest and biological species and the reduction of Pastoral potential, thus causing a massive rural exodus to the large urban centers. Despite irrational exploitation of forest resources by populations to meet their domestic energy needs (firewood and charcoal) and non-wood forest products (aerial pasture, pharmacopoeia, picking products and cosmetics), forest ecosystems Developed adaptation mechanisms that are today destabilized by climate change.</p>
<p>The most visible form of these manifestations in Mauritania is desertification and its corollaries impacts on fishing. The fisheries sector, like other sectors, is affected by climate change. The perception of these effects is achieved by monitoring the physicochemical parameters of ocean waters and marine biodiversity. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The increase in mean sea surface temperature (SST) with a northward rise of the thermal front beyond its usual geographic boundary and oxygen depletion creates more and more OMZs Which could be the source of migration of pelagic species to areas rich in oxygen;</li>
<li>The increase in water temperature and the acidification of the oceans over the last years seem to be accompanied by a multiplication of jellyfish and a recurrent phenomenon of colored waters;</li>
<li>Rising ocean levels and coastal erosion threatening the coastal infrastructure dedicated to fishing;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The increase in the frequency of storms which reduces fishing productivity</strong>. The inland fisheries sub-sector (Senegal River) faces certain climatic and other constraints: (i) Lower production, (Iii) pollution problems (pesticides) in the Senegal River, (iv) anthropogenic effects (dam), (v) silting of ponds and bodies of water, (vi) difficulties in accessing To the resource due to invasive plants, (vii) irregularity of the river regime due to dams, (viii) conflicts between indigenous and non-indigenous populations</p>
<p><em><strong>Health impacts</strong></em>. Mauritania is characterized by a worrying nutritional situation, aggravated by a hostile environment, leading to an increase in the prevalence of nutritional pathologies, leading to the emergence of infectious and parasitic diseases, in particular diarrhea and acute respiratory infections, in children under 5 years of age. Infant mortality is dominated by acute respiratory infections (21.5%), malaria (15%) and diarrheal diseases (13.5%) according to the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). These three conditions alone 50% of the under-five mortality causes; 35% of children over five years old. In addition, 32% of children under the age of five suffer from chronic malnutrition and underweight, of which 17% and 10% respectively are severe. This highlights the persistence of a disturbing nutritional situation aggravated by the episodes of drought.</p>
<h3 id="climate-expenditure-in-adaptation">4.2 - Climate expenditure in adaptation</h3>
<p><em><strong>The efforts of the State</strong></em>. The Mauritanian state has been providing enormous resources to curb the impacts of droughts since the 1970s. These have been greatly strengthened since 2010 in the form of a regular funding mechanism for adaptation to climate change . . .</p>
<p><em><strong>In the field of nature protection</strong></em>, over 20 projects and programs for the protection and restoration of nature were implemented between 1975 and 2008, relayed since 2010 by ambitious programs of adaptation to climate change. These are mainly initiatives to combat silting, reforestation, management and protection of natural resources and biodiversity conservation. The aggregate cost is estimated at approximately <strong>US $ 100 million</strong>.</p>
<p><em><strong>In the agro-pastoral sector</strong></em>, considerable efforts have been made to improve the resilience of farmers and ranchers to the impacts of climate change in the form of irrigation schemes, agricultural campaign support (agricultural marketing and climate insurance) ), Improvement of local breeds, promotion of family poultry farming. For example, the 2006-2010 PRSP Implementation Review shows an average annual investment of <strong>US $ 65 million</strong>.</p>
<p><em><strong>In the field of fisheries</strong></em>, adaptation measures were implemented as part of the 'Sustainable Fisheries and Aquaculture Sector Management Strategy' (2008-2012, extended to 2014). These actions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Protection of habitats in the euphotic zone (depth of 20m);</li>
<li>Development of management plans for major marine fisheries and the Continental Fisheries Development Plan (2010-2014);</li>
<li>Development of a strategic framework for the development of aquaculture (2010-2014).</li>
<li>The strengthening of the capacities and capacities of the ocean control institutions (Mauritanian Coast Guard) and research institutes (Mauritanian Oceanographic and Fisheries Research Institution)</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>In the area of housing, urban planning and land-use planning</strong></em>, the State has, since 2009, carried out operations of regrouping and resettling atomized villages and hamlets affected by droughts in serviced sites . This type of intervention also concerned cities where the construction of housing and the restructuring of precarious neighborhoods have mobilized significant amounts. The programs financed for the benefit of vulnerable segments of the population concerned: (i) the regrouping of 7 localities To <em><strong>4,500 Billion MROs</strong></em>, (ii) the creation of two modern cities at <em><strong>0.445 Billion MROs</strong></em>; (Iii) the restructuring of the precarious districts of Nouakchott (146,000 lots) to <em><strong>5.6 billion MROs</strong></em>; And (iv) the construction of low-cost social housing units at <em><strong>7.3 billion MRO</strong></em>. (A total of <em><strong>MRO 17.845 billion</strong></em> equivalent to <em><strong>US $ 64 million</strong></em>.</p>

<p>In Mauritania, the use of the Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) approach is unknown and has not been previously applied to mitigation measures. In order to ensure greater transparency, accuracy and comparability of information on mitigation measures, the State has already begun the process of developing a system MRV is appropriate and effective for all sectors of the national economy.</p>
<p>Implementation of this system will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Measure and monitor GHG emission reductions and carbon sequestration generated by the implementation of proposed mitigation measures;</li>
<li>Facilitate the identification and evaluation of objectively verifiable monitoring indicators in order to measure progress against targets;</li>
<li>Promote the reporting and reporting of GHG emission reductions and the benefits of proposed mitigation measures in a transparent manner; and</li>
<li>Allow verification, possibly by an independent third party, and the reliability of the results obtained through the implementation of the proposed mitigation measures.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="institutional-framework-for-implementation-and-monitoring---evaluation">5.2 - Institutional Framework for Implementation and Monitoring - Evaluation</h3>
<p>At the request of the Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable Development (MEDD), each Ministry has appointed a Sector Focal Point (PFS) in charge of the topic of climate change for its sector. Mauritania has therefore developed a network of Sectoral Focal Points on climate change within the ministerial departments to improve the implementation of the objectives of the Convention and systematically introduce climate change concerns in all sectoral activities. Similarly, Mauritania has set up a monitoring-evaluation system of the national environmental action plan (SE-PANE), which will be expanded to include Mauritania's Contribution Through capacity building of the monitoring and evaluation structures of all relevant Departments.</p>
<h2 id="equity-and-ambition">6 - Equity and ambition</h2>
<p>Mauritania is part of both non-Annex I and LDCs affected by desertification; It is a member of the negotiating groups Climate: '' G77 and China '', '' group of Arab countries '', '' African group '' and '' group of Sahelian countries ''. That is why it shares the concerns and positions of all these groups, who see adaptation as a priority and are working to make the Paris Conference a successful Conference of the Parties. Mauritania's GHG emissions are negligible compared to global emissions (0.00015 or 0.015%) and therefore considers it fair that it can continue its development to make its economy and populations resilient to the impacts of change Climate change.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Mauritania is committed to fully participate in the effort of the international community to reduce its GHG emissions by 22.3% in 2030 compared to the projected emissions in the same year, according to the baseline scenario business). With emissions of the order of 2 tons CO<sub>2</sub> eq per capita, the Mauritania Contribution is fair and ambitious.</p>
<p>Implementation of this Contribution would result in a cumulative emission reduction of 33.56 Mt CO<sub>2</sub> eq. from 2020 to 2030 at a total estimated cost of $ 9.3 billion</p>
<p>Of this contribution, 88% is conditional for cumulative emission reductions of 29.53 Mt CO 2 eq and a cost of 8.2 billion US dollars. Mauritania aims to strengthen its climate monitoring system in order to better organize the mitigation effort expected of each sector of its development, to pursue its renewable energy development program, to enhance its reserves of liquefied petroleum gas) Via the electricity generation shared with Mali and Senegal.</p>
<p>Mauritania is considering updating its contribution to take account of the evolution of its development.</p>
