<h1><strong>CONTRIBUTION NATIONALLY DETERMINED TO THE MITIGATION OF CLIMATE CHANGE (NDC) OF THE NICARAGUA REPUBLIC BEFORE THE UNITED NATIONS FRAMEWORK CONVENTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE (UNFCCC)</strong></h1>
<p><strong>Managua Nicaragua.</strong></p>
<p><strong>August, 2018</strong></p>
<h1><strong>SUMMARY</strong></h1>
<p>Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Nicaragua reported between 2000 and 2010, represent 0.01% of global emissions for the same period, values ​​are very insignificant in global statistics on global emissions of greenhouse gases.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Nationally Determined Contribution of Nicaragua is to contribute to the fulfillment of the Paris Agreement in relation to the mitigation of Climate Change and is oriented, mainly, to the Sectors of Energy and Agriculture, Land Use and Land Use Changes, through measures to increase the sources of renewable energy sources, as well as measures for forest conservation and recovery.</p>
<p>This National Contribution, based on the right to sustainable development of the People of Nicaragua, contemplates the achievement of the goals based on what is established in the normative and policy instruments with national contributions, foreign investment and international cooperation, both for the energy sector as for the agriculture sector, use and change of land uses.</p>
<p>Between 2007 and 2016, 355.15 MW of renewable energy were installed in Nicaragua, reaching 53.5% of total generation based on renewable sources until 2017.</p>
<p>In this context, it is important to note that the national coverage rose to 93.2% in 2017, in relation to the 69.8% that existed in the year 2010.</p>
<p>The Nationally Determined Contribution of the energy sector will be to increase the percentage of electricity generation through renewable energy sources, to 60% by 2030.</p>
<p>Among other Measures and Policies in the Land Use and Land Use Change Sector as a national contribution, agroecological production, plantations of permanent crops under shade that are resistant to the impacts of climate change, as well as Reduction of practices will be promoted. extensive livestock farming and the incorporation of forests in idle lands that conserve the national capacities of carbon sinks.</p>
<p>Due to its geographical position, Nicaragua is exposed to various events linked to natural climate variability, such as the ENSO phenomenon (El Niño-La Niña), Pacific Monsoon systems, hurricanes, among others, that generate significant drought threats, floods, landslides, water deficit, destruction of crops, forests and homes.</p>
<p>To face adaptation to climate change, the country requires financial support to develop priority adaptation measures such as: Modernization of the country's hydrometeorological services, which allow to maintain accurate forecasts and early warning systems, Construction of the Drainage Master Plan in the capital city and other pacific cities of Nicaragua that are very vulnerable to floods, develop a national program of water harvesting and promotion of irrigation systems in the dry corridor of Nicaragua, strengthen national capacities in climate finance to facilitate access to financial sources, Increase the effectiveness in the protection of biosphere reserves through a land management program and boost reforestation,as well as to elaborate the National Plan of Adaptation to the climatic Change and Implementation of the National Policy of Mitigation and Adaptation to Climate Change, Development of potable water and sanitation infrastructure and resilience programs of urban potable water systems, Access to additional resources to implement adaptation measures in the road infrastructure network, Capacity development, access to technology and financing in the agricultural sector; and Implement resilient management programs for prioritized ecosystems with a landscape approach.</p>
<h1><strong>I. NATIONAL CONTEXT</strong></h1>
<h2><strong>I.1. Main geographical and socioeconomic features</strong></h2>
<p>The Republic of Nicaragua is a country located in the Central American isthmus, between the equatorial line and the Tropic of Cancer, approximately between 11 ° and 15 ° North latitude and with respect to the Greenwich Meridian, between 83 ° and 88 ° of West length. It has an approximate area of ​​130,370 km², ( <a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> ) bounded on the north by Honduras, on the south by Costa Rica, on the west by the Pacific Ocean and on the east by the Caribbean Sea. As for maritime limits, in the Pacific Ocean, it borders with El Salvador, Honduras and Costa Rica; while in the Caribbean Sea it borders Honduras, Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica and Jamaica ( <a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> ).</p>
<p>Nicaragua is composed of 15 departments and 2 autonomous regions. They are governing bodies: the Legislative Power, the Executive Power, the Judicial Power and the Electoral Power, with separation of powers.</p>
<p>The Nicaraguan people are multi-ethnic in nature and Spanish is the official language, although the languages ​​of the indigenous and Afro-descendant peoples are also recognized, such as Nicaraguan Creole English, Misquito, Sumu or Sumo, Garífuna and Rama. The estimated population until 2016 is 5,966,798 inhabitants</p>
<p>The economic activities of Nicaragua are divided into three main categories: primary sector (agriculture, livestock, forestry, hunting and fishing); secondary sector (mining, industry and construction), and tertiary sector (government, commerce, transport, banking, infrastructure, etc.)</p>
<p>According to figures from the Central Bank, the gross domestic product (GDP) in Nicaragua reached US $ 11,255 million in 2013 ( <a href="#fn3"class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> ). The GDP per capital was US $ 1,831, with a growth of 4.4% compared to the previous year. At present, 57% of the total value produced in Nicaragua is generated through the activities of the tertiary sector, while the secondary and primary sectors generate 26% and 17%, respectively.</p>
<p>Nicaragua is traditionally an agricultural country; A high percentage (almost 50%) of its productive population is dedicated to this activity and to a lesser degree to forestry (exploitation of wood and firewood), hunting and fishing. In addition to providing products for the subsistence of the inhabitants, primary activities contribute in part to exports and are, in turn, those that give more work and employ more labor, which results in benefits for those who dedicate themselves to them.</p>
<p>Since 2011, Nicaragua has maintained growth levels above the average for Latin America and the Caribbean, despite the difficult internal conditions due to the lack of governance inherited from previous governments and the global economic complexities.</p>
<p>According to the World Bank, Nicaragua has stood out for maintaining disciplined macroeconomic policies, combined with a constant expansion of exports and direct foreign investment.</p>
<p>In 2011, growth reached a record 5.1 percent, with a slowdown to 4.9 and 4.7 in 2015 and 2016, respectively. For this year, the forecast stands at 4.6 percent, with which Nicaragua ranks second among Central American countries, with favorable prospects for foreign direct investment and trade.</p>
<p>According to the Survey of Measurement of Living Standards 2014, of the National Institute of Development Information, for the period 2009 to 2014, in Nicaragua there was a decrease of 13 percentage points in national poverty, which fell from 42.5 to 29.6 percent. While, for the same period, extreme poverty showed a decrease of 6 percentage points, after moving from 14.6 percent to 8.3 percent ( <a href="#fn4"class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> ).</p>
<p>However, the progress made, the challenges in economic growth and poverty reduction are still great, because Nicaragua is still one of the least developed countries in Latin America.</p>
<p>The National Human Development Plan (PNDH) is also being updated to 2018, where its general objective is to reduce inequality by increasing the fight against poverty, reducing spending and increasing investment in social sectors and infrastructure. rural.</p>
<h2><strong>I.2. National objectives and priorities</strong></h2>
<p>Nicaragua bases its priorities on facilitating and accelerating economic growth as a premise to reduce poverty and the current high vulnerability to climate variability and the impacts of climate change.</p>
<p>The country has maintained and maintains active participation and commitment of the State at the national and international level in the climate change negotiations where it has defended the need for greater commitment in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by the most emitting countries, in order to meet the objective of not exceeding a warming higher than 2 degrees centigrade in this century.</p>
<p>They are strategic priorities to face the challenges of climate change, the strengthening of institutions; the consolidation of the model of dialogues and alliances with the productive sector as a space of consensus and joint work, the diversification of the energy matrix; the management and restoration of watersheds, with emphasis on the restoration of soils, water sources and forests; the protection and conservation of biodiversity; Protection and recovery of forests in areas of water recharge and bodies of water, Increase and / or maintenance of biodiversity in protected areas and biological corridors, which includes the conservation and natural regeneration activities of protected areas, conservation and enrichment of forests in protected areas,</p>
<p>The National Human Development Plan 2018-2021 also focuses its medium-term actions aimed at:</p>
<ul>
<li>Promote economic and social development, guaranteeing the protection of the Environment and Natural Resources, with low carbon emissions, adapted to climate change and reducing exposure and vulnerability to disasters.</li>
</ul>
<p>Continue to implement the policy of environmental education, preservation and sustainability of the environment and natural resources.</p>

<ul>
<li>Promote the use and sustainable management of Protected Areas.</li>
<li>Promote the conservation and recovery of soil, water and forest resources.</li>
<li>Prepare the National Plan for Adaptation to Climate Change, based on an assessment of current risks, facilitating the main lines of action for an efficient adaptation under the model of dialogue, alliances and consensus with the private sector.</li>
<li>Fulfill the commitments made with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, including the Paris Agreement.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>I.3. Advances of the country in the legal and institutional context.</strong></h2>
<p>Nicaragua has developed important and significant efforts to face the challenges of Climate Change, among which the publication of the National Environmental Strategy and Climate Change in 2010, which is made up of five strategic guidelines that are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Environmental Education for Life.</li>
<li>Defense and Environmental Protection of Natural Resources.</li>
<li>Conservation, Recovery, Harvesting and Harvesting of Water.</li>
<li>Mitigation, Adaptation and Risk Management in the face of Climate Change.</li>
<li>Sustainable Management of the Earth.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Government of Reconciliation and National Unity bases its policy on favoring economic and social development by protecting the most vulnerable sectors of the population, through a model of direct work with families and communities, creating skills, knowledge and behavior that allow the population to face and recovering from all the risks of disasters, as well as a model of working in alliances with the productive sector, in permanent dialogue to face the challenges of economic development, the generation of employment and reduction of poverty.</p>
<p>The National Climate Change Policy, which contains the following guidelines, is currently under consultation:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Agricultural development resistant to the impacts of current climate variability, as well as future climate, promoting actions that favor low greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
<li>Implement a low carbon energy development strategy with the capacity to adapt to climate change.</li>
<li>Promote the development of Human Settlements adapted to climate change and low in greenhouse gas emissions</li>
<li>Development of infrastructure adapted to climate change and with low carbon emissions.</li>
<li>Use and conservation of eco-systemic services to achieve a low carbon development and adapted to the climate.</li>
<li>Conservation, restoration and rational use of forests, as well as promoting forest plantations in forestry areas.</li>
<li>Promote knowledge, research, financing and information on adaptation and mitigation to climate change, as well as the modernization and strengthening of surveillance and early warning systems.</li>
</ol>
<p>In terms of energy, there is an abundant regulatory and legal framework that favors the rational use of electricity, prioritizing the use of renewable generation sources, among which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>LAW 956 of 2017: Energy Efficiency Law, which establishes the legal framework to promote the rational and efficient use of energy, in order to guarantee the energy supply, promote the competitiveness of the national economy, protect and improve the quality of life of the population, contributing at the same time to the protection of the environment. The Law establishes the National Energy Efficiency Program (PRONAEE), which is an instrument of the National Energy Efficiency Policy, to establish the objectives, goals, strategies and investment requirements for the development of activities throughout the energy chain, towards the rational and efficient use of energy.</li>
<li>LAW 901 of 2015: Law to reform Law 532: Law for the promotion of electricity generation with renewable energy sources granting benefits for this type of energy generation.</li>
<li>LAW 443 of 2014: Exploration and exploitation of geothermal resources law with its incorporated reforms, whose purpose is to promote and establish the basic rules that regulate exploration and exploitation activities of geothermal resources for the exclusive generation of electric power.</li>
<li>LAW 532 of 2008: Law for the Promotion of Electricity Generation with Renewable Sources This Law is intended to promote the development of new electric generation projects with renewable sources and of projects that carry out extensions to the installed generation capacity with renewable sources, which are currently in operation, as well as electric power generation projects that source biomass and / or biogas produced in a sustainable manner, establishing fiscal, economic and financial incentives that contribute to this development, within a framework of exploitation sustainable use of renewable energy resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main contributions of Nicaragua in terms of voluntary mitigation of climate change are described below:</p>
<p><strong>Energy Sector:</strong> The Government of National Unity and Reconciliation has increased the production of renewable energy from 25% in 2007, up to 51% in 2013, even in conditions of severe rationing of the energy that existed at the time of taking of power, which came from the year 2005.</p>
<p><strong>Environmental Pollution</strong> : To contribute to the protection of the ozone layer, the consumption of gases called CFCs has been eliminated 100% as of January 1, 2010 and a Management Plan for the elimination of types is being implemented of HCFCs gases from 2012 to 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Farming</strong> : In 2010, Nicaragua joined the Global Methane Initiative, which aims, in the short term, to reduce global methane emissions, capturing it at a reasonable cost and using it as a source of clean energy. Up to 2010, 1,512 biodigesters have been built, of which approximately 300 to 400 are in operation.</p>
<p><strong>Transportation:</strong> The project &quot;Promotion of Environmentally Sustainable Transportation in Metropolitan Managua&quot; is being implemented, within the priorities to reform the public transport system in the Metropolitan area of ​​Managua, as reflected in the Comprehensive Transportation Plan. Obtaining a direct reduction of 892,000 tons of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions over the next 20 years.</p>
<p><strong>Waste:</strong> The integrated development project of La Chureca has included not only the sealing of the landfill of the same name, considered the largest in Latin America, but also the construction of a recycling plant in which garbage collectors work, as well as the construction of houses, a school for the more than 250 families that inhabit the place and the reduction of the gases produced by the own decomposing garbage that before the intervention produced spontaneous combustions in the whole surface of the landfill, now they are driven abroad by a circuit of pipes and gasification chimneys through which methane gas exits. These gases are expected to be used in electricity generation by the Mayor's Office of Managua.</p>
<p>Since 2007, Wastewater Treatment Systems have increased significantly, by the year 2010, 13 departmental headers provide treatment to wastewater</p>
<p>Since the start of operations of the Wastewater Treatment Plant in Managua, the percentage of treatment of wastewater collected in the country improved significantly from 35.22% in 2007 to 98.19% for the year 2011 and the treatment index went from 19.66% to 57.63%.</p>
<p><strong>Forests:</strong> Nicaragua received the approval of the Cooperative Forest Carbon Fund, through the ENDE-REDD + program of MARENA, with the assistance of the World Bank, through which the rural communities and indigenous peoples living in the forests of the Caribbean Coast, Bosawás and Indio Maiz will reduce deforestation and forest degradation, reducing emissions of approximately 11 million tons of carbon dioxide and positive incentives will be received in exchange for 55 million dollars in five years.</p>
<p>The aforementioned advances are the support or the starting platform to achieve a future scenario of economic and social growth with low greenhouse gas emissions and with the capacity to adapt to the impacts of climate variability and climate change, since the policy of climate change defines a path with specific guidelines and actions that must be adopted in the immediate future, as well as the legal framework, which favors energy efficiency and investment facilities in renewable energy, contribute to the creation of a framework for the development of energy sector with low carbon emissions,while many of the actions that have been developed contribute to the learning of the whole society and are directly taxed for the fulfillment of the National Contribution of Nicaragua.</p>
<h2><strong>I.4. Characterization of national greenhouse gas emissions</strong></h2>
<p>GHG emissions for the year 2010, expressed in giga grams of carbon dioxide equivalent (GgCO2 eq), were calculated at 15,267.09 <strong>GgCO<sub>2</sub> eq</strong> , representing <strong>15,267,090</strong> tons of CO<sub>2</sub>eq, with a per capita emission rate of 2.0 tons of CO<sub>2</sub>eq. per inhabitant, which means 0.01% of global emissions for that period ( <a href="#fn5"class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> ).</p>
<p><img src="img/NIC-1.png" width="535" height="289" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 1: Per capita emission rate at the country group level</strong></p>
<p>Globally, for the period 2000-2010, greenhouse gas emissions were distributed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Group of OECD countries 56.9% of global emissions.</li>
<li>Group of Asia Pacific countries 25.59% of global emissions.</li>
<li>European Union 21.04% of global emissions.</li>
<li>Latin America and the Caribbean 4.42% of global emissions.</li>
<li>Africa 2.81% of global emissions.</li>
<li>Nicaragua 0.01% of global emissions.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to figures from the World Bank, for the period 2000-2010, Nicaragua ranked 111th in the world ranking in total greenhouse gas emissions ( <a href="#fn6"class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> ).</p>
<p>As shown in the following figure, the contribution of GHG emissions in 2010 by category in terms of GgCO<sub>2</sub>eq. is as follows: 67.89% corresponds to the Use and Use of Land use sector, 29.40% to the Energy sector, 1.98% to the Waste sector and 0.73% to the Industrial Processes sector. In 2005, the emissions were estimated at 19,193.72 GgCO<sub>2</sub>eq, of which 75.34% corresponds to the Use and Use of Land sector, 22.49% to the Energy sector and 2.16% to the Waste and Industrial Processes sector; and in the base year 2000, 52,377.59 GgCO<sub>2</sub> were accounted foreq of which 91.56% of the estimated emissions correspond to the Use and Change of Land Uses sector, followed by the Energy sector with 7.81% of the emissions, the Waste and Industrial Processes sectors represented 0.63% of the emissions of that sector. year.</p>
<p><img src="img/NIC-2.png" width="594" height="448" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 2: GHG Emissions by Sector</strong></p>
<p><strong>Emissions of Carbon Dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)</strong></p>
<p>The CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in 2010 were 6,523.08 Gg, which represent a contribution of 42.73% to the total inventory and indicate a decrease of 86.05% with respect to the base year 2000. The CO2 emissions in the country come mainly from the change in use of land and the burning of fossil fuels.</p>
<p><strong>Methane emissions (CH<sub>4</sub>)</strong></p>
<p>In 2010, the emissions of CH<sub>4</sub> were 6,491.97 GgCO<sub>2</sub>eq, which represents an increase of 35.74 %% with respect to the base year 2000. The main source of emission corresponds to the source of enteric fermentation of livestock.</p>
<p><strong>Emissions of Nitrous Dioxide (N<sub>2</sub>O)</strong></p>
<p>In 2010, the N<sub>2</sub>O emissions were 2,252.03 GgCO<sub>2</sub>eq, which represents an increase of 35.37% with respect to the base year 2000. The main contribution comes from agricultural soils with 93.88%; energy with 4.32%, manure management 1.65% and waste 0.15%.</p>
<p><img src="img/NIC-3.png" width="590" height="448" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 3: Emissions by Gas Type</strong></p>
<p>The limited size of the emissions is attributable to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Electrical connectivity gap (69.8% of homes in 2010) and 6% of the population lives in isolated rural areas in 2017.</li>
<li>Severe energy rationing between 2005 and 2007 caused cement production to be excessively low, which decreased the volume of gases in that period.</li>
<li>Low motorization rate (750,000 motor vehicles and 330,000 motorcycles for population close to 6 million inhabitants),</li>
<li>Only households with a high standard of living had air conditioning,</li>
<li>Livestock not intensified,</li>
<li>Moderate deforestation (According to the CAIT (CAIT Climate Data Explorer, 2017. Washington, DC: World Resources Institute, available online at: <a href="http://cait.wri.org/"><em>http://cait.wri.org</em></a> ), the most recent estimates for Nicaragua would be 14.52 Million. Tons of CO2 equivalent without forestry and land use change and 14.72 including land use.),</li>
<li>Low level of urban solid waste generation.</li>
<li>Absence of sewage treatment plants generating methane.</li>
</ul>
<p>The economic and social conditions from 2010 to 2016 have changed significantly, therefore, greenhouse gas emissions have been growing and the future trend is growth, as important growths in various sectors are anticipated in the coming decades ( transport, industry, manufacturing production in free zones, growth of the construction and cement production sector, livestock, use of air conditioning due to the high temperatures that are usually registered in the Pacific region for at least seven months of the year, solid waste management and liquids, etc.), so you can not assume a &quot;business as usual&quot; growth scenario.</p>
<h1><strong>II. MITIGATION</strong></h1>
<h2><strong>II.1. Climate change mitigation scenarios</strong></h2>
<p>Within the framework of the Third National Communication on Climate Change, a study of the possible scenarios of mitigation to climate change in Nicaragua was developed without receiving funding and considering different possible routes.</p>
<p>For the elaboration of the study four possible scenarios were constructed with different levels of assumptions that are developed in the following table</p>
<p><strong>Table 1: Proposed scenarios</strong></p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Trend Scenario T</strong></td>
<td>In a tendential scenario it is possible to sustain the economic growth of the last years (around 5%), with a demographic bonus, but without making maximum use of the potentials or natural resources, neither of the human capital nor of the opportunities to be inserted in global value chains. This scenario was considered as the base scenario</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Scenario of efficient use of natural resources R</strong></td>
<td>It is possible to optimize the use of natural resources, improving the productivity of natural resources by adding 2 points to the annual GDP growth for efficiency. This scenario does not contemplate social transformation in a prosperous situation for some, although it is not very inclusive. This scenario is calculated with the IFs model as the policy model.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Inclusive globalization scenario U</strong></td>
<td>Nicaragua achieves social transformation, which generates industrialization, human development, insertion in value chains and transformation of the productive force. This scenario is calculated with the IFs model as the sustainability scenario.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Underdevelopment scenario S</strong></td>
<td>Social, natural (volcanic or earthquake) and climatic phenomena affect the productivity of natural resources, leading to situations that reduce economic and human development. It is impossible to meet the SDGs by 2030 and a new lost decade arises.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In order to carry out the modeling of each scenario, the IFs model ( <a href="#fn7"class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> ) was used, which has an Advanced Sustainability Analysis (ASA) module developed by the Future Research Center of Finland in 2002 and has been perfected by the Pardee Center, to its most current version.</p>
<p>The basis of the calculation is the relationship between material inputs (such as fossil fuels and water) in human systems and the emissions that originate from them (such as carbon dioxide) on the one hand and the size of GDP, population and labor force, on the other. The results can be obtained graphically or tabularly.</p>
<p>The following table shows the expected cumulative annual percentage variation of Nicaragua's emissions in the coming decades with changes in population and economy (See Table 2).</p>

<p>Source: Study of the Mitigation of Climate Change scenarios in Nicaragua, Third National Communication on Climate Change. (In development)</p>
<p>From the previous projections it can be seen that by the year 2030, growth is expected to oscillate between 33% and 55% increase in greenhouse gas emissions, explained by the needs of the population and the economy (Yellow color In the table).</p>
<p>In the most optimistic scenario, Nicaragua would stabilize its emissions between 2051 and 2066, but in the worst case, this would happen only many years after 2070.</p>
<p>Using the same scenarios and making use of a module of the IFS model, the projected deforestation calculation was made based on the socioeconomic variables. This module also allows the calculation of projected deforestation according to socioeconomic variables.</p>
<p>According to the population and economy, the possible control of deforestation is expected in the 2050s, however, deforestation could continue in the worst case scenario. (Green color on the table).</p>
<p>In addition to the above, by the year 2030, Nicaragua will have a population of 7 million inhabitants ( <a href="#fn8"class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> ) and, on the other hand, according to ECLAC, there will be a vehicle fleet that will exceed one million vehicles (between 2 and 3.5 million current cars against 700, 000) ( <a href="#fn9"class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> ). To which is added an increase of at least 7 million cattle (may exceed 10 million) with greater size, weight and therefore higher emissions.</p>
<p>The roads that lead to further development will generate a growth in greenhouse gas emissions, compared to 2010 levels.</p>
<h2><strong>II.2. National Contribution on Mitigation</strong></h2>
<p>Nicaragua's Nationally Determined Contribution to Mitigation of Climate Change includes the sectors Energy and Land Use and Land Use Changes, through measures to increase other renewable energy sources such as solar, geothermal, natural gas and wind, as well as measures for forest conservation and recovery.</p>
<p>The National Contribution of Nicaragua contemplates the achievement of the goals based on what is established in the normative and policy instruments with national contributions and foreign investment, both for the energy sector and for the sector of use and change of land uses. .</p>
<p>The ambition in the UT-CUTS sector to have international financial support may be increased to reduce the advance of the agricultural frontier.</p>
<h3><strong>II.2.1. Energy Sector</strong></h3>
<p>Up to 2016 Nominal Installed Capacity, taking into account the different sources of energy used for the generation of electricity is 1,396.32 MW, of which 735.19 MW (52.65%) are constituted by the thermal park that generates electricity based of fuel oil and diesel, the wind power plants have an installed capacity of 186.20 MW (13.34%), the biomass plants that operate with cane bagasse (sugar mills) incorporate 176.60 MW (12.65%), the hydroelectric park has 142.45 MW ( 10.20%), the installed geothermal capacity is of 154.50 MW (11.06%) and the photovoltaic solar plant with 1.38 MW (0.10%). It is important to mention the considerable increase in the installed capacity of power generation plants that use renewable sources in recent years. From the year 2007 to the year 2016,<a href="#fn10"class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>In this context it is important to note that the national coverage rose to 93.2% in 2017, in relation to the 69.8% that existed in the year 2010.</p>
<p>The growth of generation through renewable energy sources has been limited by the high price of technologies to produce energy from these sources, which has forced to balance the production of energy with various sources.</p>
<p>The Nationally Determined Contribution to the mitigation of the energy sector will be to increase the percentage of electricity generation through other sources of renewable energies such as solar, wind and biomass by 60% in the year 2030, which represents an increase over 2007. 35% in the participation of renewable energies within the national electricity matrix, considering the increase in coverage.</p>
<h3><strong>II.2.2. Use and Land Use Change Sector</strong></h3>
<p>Since 2008, Nicaragua has begun negotiations to develop the REDD + preparation process, and in 2013 a REDD + initiative was approved, financed by the Carbon Cooperative Fund and administered by the World Bank, to implement a conservation program for forests and prevent their degradation, which will come into effect between 2019-2014 and consists of reducing emissions by 11 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub>eq. within Protected Areas in the Autonomous Regions of the Caribbean Coast of Nicaragua.</p>
<p>Another potential mitigation potential that was studied was the 72 protected areas that Nicaragua has, of which 25 are located in the Pacific climate region with a predominance of dry forests on 10,689 hectares, the central region of the country with a part of forests located in dry climate and another part in semi humid climate with 5, 282 Ha and the protected areas of the Caribbean Coast Regions, which are located in humid and very humid 15,272 Ha, also in this region are located two Biosphere Reserves totaling 2,232,968 Ha.</p>
<p>A study carried out within the framework of the Third National Communication on Climate Change, to elaborate this analysis, identifies on the official maps of land uses between 2010 and 2015, that the uses of the forest land within protected areas for the year 2010 were of 44.88% and for 2015 those uses were of 42.19% with a decreasing tendency of the forest lands of the protected areas in five years of 2.69%, meaning an annual rate of change of the forest lands to other uses of the 20 %, or 11,305 Ha / years</p>
<p>As a result of the previous study, by 2015 protected areas emitted 4316.66 Gigramos CO<sub>2</sub>eq. and absorbed 10,798.45 Gigram of CO2 eq. This shows that even in these protected areas, important resources are required for their conservation.</p>
<h4><strong>II.2.2.1.1. Measures and Policies in the Sector Land Use and Land Use Change as a national contribution</strong></h4>
<p>The main measures that the Government will take as a result of the national climate change policy as a national contribution in this sector are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Agro-ecological production will be promoted, plantations of permanent crops under shade resistant to the impacts of climate change,</li>
<li>Reduction of extensive livestock practices and incorporation of forests in idle lands,</li>
<li>Development of forest plantations, incorporation of trees in livestock farms (silvo-livestock systems),</li>
<li>Continue incorporating the use of biodigesters for the treatment of agricultural waste,</li>
<li>The restoration and conservation of ecosystems and their services are crucial to increase the capacity to adapt to climate change and maintain or improve the capacity to mitigate greenhouse gases in those ecosystems that are socially and culturally viable and economically efficient.</li>
<li>Attention will be paid to Conservation and Restoration in water recharge zones, as well as to support the implementation of the National Plan of Water Resources.</li>
<li>Strengthen the effectiveness of management in protected areas and the sustainable use of wet and dry forests through the strengthening, management and conservation of protected areas with investments in infrastructure for protection, within and in the surrounding areas.</li>
<li>Promote the restoration, conservation and rational use of the wetlands and mangroves of the Pacific and Caribbean of Nicaragua, which are ecosystems rich in biodiversity, natural resources and genetic diversity, with important ecological functions for the adaptation and mitigation of climate change.</li>
<li>Compliance with the law on the felling of mangrove forests will be monitored and implemented, as well as promoting, facilitating and promoting the reproduction and development of mangrove seedlings.</li>
<li>Each municipality will select forest areas as centers for environmental initiatives, education and learning for young people and adults.</li>
<li>In lands with a forest vocation, priority will be given to the natural regeneration of the forest, due to its low cost by not doing any intervention. The second priority is the reforestation with species of trees typical of the ecosystem, and in lands with other uses or degraded, forest plantations will be favored for commercial and / or energy purposes.</li>
<li>Continue with the implementation of the Reforestation Master Plan, directing efforts in its four objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Protection and recovery of water recharge zones and bodies of water.</li>
<li>Reduction of risks to erosion and landslide.</li>
<li>Increase and / or maintenance of biodiversity in protected areas and biological corridors.</li>
<li>Contribution to the local economy through agroforestry systems and establishment of forest plantations for commercial purposes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Guarantee the collection and preservation of seeds of typical trees of each type of forest in the country to achieve reproduction in nurseries, to prevent their extinction</li>
</ol>
<p>These measures will be promoted by the Government in consensus with the private sector and international cooperation, with whom the National Climate Change Policy has been consulted</p>

<h1><strong>IV. LEVEL OF AMBITION OF THE CONTRIBUTION</strong></h1>
<p>The national proposals reflected in this national contribution are fair and ambitious because despite the almost zero national contribution to global emissions, the country establishes a commitment to continue increasing the generation of renewable energy in the national energy matrix up to 60% for the year 2030, considering that the effort is made under a global economic framework in which the prices of technologies to produce renewable energy are much higher than other technologies whose sources of energy production are highly polluting.</p>
<p>Also, the Government of Nicaragua, together with its people, works hard to raise production levels, reduce poverty and recover from the annual losses caused by events associated with climate variability and climate change, incorporating actions and measures to to conserve the forest cover of the forests, in the protected areas and work under a model of alliances, dialogues and consensus with the private sector to increase the forest cover in the agricultural production systems, without having access to sources of financing for it.</p>
<p>If the country receives international financing, an increase in the capacity of Carbon absorption could be achieved by 20% with respect to the Reference Scenario, for the year 2030.</p>
<h1><strong>V. PLANNING, IMPLEMENTATION PROCESSES AND FOLLOW-UP TO THE CONTRIBUTION</strong></h1>
<p>Prior to Nicaragua's accession to the Paris Agreement, the country has been developing actions to reduce greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change and has defined actions to initiate the implementation of a national policy by 2018 that assumes important actions for the reduction of emissions to the year 2020.</p>
<p>It is planned to carry out the consultations with the different sectors during 2018, prior to its submission to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, as well as the establishment of commitments by the sectors.</p>
<p>The mechanisms of Measurement, Reporting and Verification will also be used through the instance of the Government that defines the Presidency of the Republic.</p>
<h1><strong>VI. CHALLENGES, BARRIERS AND NEEDS</strong></h1>
<p>Nicaragua faces the great challenge of growing economically to reduce poverty in a context where climate change produces threats that generate losses and damages, which is why it is essential to achieve economic growth that reduces losses and sustainable over time. It is necessary to face the following challenges:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Access to financial resources for adaptation to climate change, which implies the strengthening of capacities in climate finance</li>
<li>The training of capacities to create knowledge, behaviors and habits that contribute to the process of adaptation in all sectors of the country.</li>
<li>Develop monitoring, monitoring and early warning systems for hydrometeorological events.</li>
<li>Continue strengthening the institutional framework of the National Contribution, through the implementation of the national policy of mitigation and adaptation to climate change and continue working on the model of dialogues and alliances with the productive sector.</li>
</ol>
<h1><strong>VII. COMPONENT ADAPTATION</strong></h1>
<p>Due to its position and geographical characteristics, Nicaragua is exposed to various events linked to natural climate variability, such as the ENSO phenomenon (El Niño-La Niña), Pacific Monsoon systems, tropical waves and hurricanes, among others, that generate significant threats of drought, floods, landslides, water deficit, destruction of crops, forests and homes.</p>
<p>Due to economic, social, cultural and environmental factors, Nicaragua is highly vulnerable to the threats generated by climatic variability and climate change, which implies significant losses and damages to human and economic lives annually, which according to World Bank figures amount to 301.75 million dollars of purchasing power, equivalent to an average annual loss per unit of GDP of 1.72%.</p>
<p>To face adaptation to climate change, the country requires financial support to develop priority adaptation measures, such as:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Modernization of the country's hydrometeorological services, which allow accurate forecasts and early warning systems to be maintained for an effective and efficient response, which includes modernization in observation systems, assimilation and forecasting, access to sensors and technologies, as well as the formation of resources qualified humans. The necessary investment in this measure is approximately 30 million dollars.</li>
<li>Measures for the development of infrastructure and drainage systems in the capital city and other Pacific cities of Nicaragua that are highly vulnerable to flooding. The cost of these investments is approximately 450 million dollars for the capital city.</li>
<li>Develop a national program for water collection and irrigation system promotion in the dry corridor of Nicaragua, for an investment amount of approximately 800 million dollars.</li>
<li>Increase the efficiency in the protection of biosphere reserves through a program of land management and promotion of reforestation, for an investment amount of approximately 400 million dollars.</li>
<li>Cooperation for the strengthening of capacities in climate finance.</li>
<li>Development of potable water and sanitation infrastructure and resilience programs of urban potable water systems.</li>
<li>Access to additional resources to implement adaptation measures in the road infrastructure network.</li>
<li>Capacity development, access to technology and financing in the agricultural sector.</li>
<li>Implement resilient management programs for prioritized ecosystems with a landscape approach.</li>
<li>Elaborate and implement the National Plan of Adaptation to Climate Change at sector level.</li>
<li>Implement the National Plan for Water Resources.</li>
<li>Promote adaptation measures focused on the Human Settlements of Nicaragua.</li>
<li>Development of knowledge and response capabilities on the impacts of climate change on human health of the Nicaraguan people</li>
