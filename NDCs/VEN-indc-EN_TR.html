<p>November 2015</p>
<h2 id="a.---presentation">A. - Presentation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Since its foundation our country has grown on the ideals of freedom, justice and independence, democracy and inclusion, aimed at reducing inequities and empowering peoples. Venezuela's struggle for independence from the colonial powers extended to five countries, under the conviction of the right and duty of the people to choose their own destiny from justice and solidary coexistence. That struggle is still going on.</li>
<li>Simón Bolívar, recognized as the father of the Venezuelan homeland, defined some anti-colonialist and anti-imperialist American geopolitics; Left traced the fundamental conceptual elements, the categories of what is a geopolitical thesis that we claim 200 years later: the need to build the balance of nations, a world of justice, a world of peace.</li>
<li>We are convinced that capitalist values such as consumerism, individualism and unlimited growth are the basis of the enormous social, political and environmental crisis that our civilization is undergoing. In the words of Major Chávez, Capitalism, the capitalist economy, ends up destroying the environment, destroying society, destroying the planet. It is the capitalist economy that is the fundamental cause of the destruction that exists today on the planet, of the great natural and climatic imbalances that have broken the balance on Earth. “.“It is practically and ethically unacceptable to sacrifice to the human species by invoking in a demented way the validity of a socioeconomic model with a galloping destructive capacity. It is suicidal to insist on disseminating it and imposing it as an infallible remedy for the evils of which it is precisely the principal cause. </li>
<li>Capitalist values must be replaced by values based on justice, solidarity, community life, harmony with nature and respect for their cycles, respect for the spirituality of peoples, respect for indigenous values ​​and knowledge and Peasants. In other words, they must be replaced by Eco socialist values. We believe that our societies must change and that this transformation can only happen from the roots, from the participation, actions and knowledge of groups and basic social organizations, from justice, equity, respect and inclusion.</li>
<li>Venezuela has taken on the challenge of transformation. We are eco-socialists, by conviction of spirit and reason. We affirm our commitment to the construction of an alternative model of development and our unwavering will to work shoulder to shoulder with all those who want to accept the responsibility that the peoples of the world have given us. As President Nicolás Maduro recently stated at the United Nations Assembly, we believe that a new concept, a new world as a necessity of humanity, is necessary; A geopolitics of respect for peoples, identity; A policy of coexistence; A policy of peace with justice, with equality; A policy that rejects any attempt to impose the will of one country over another; Whether through the threat and use of force, or through financial, economic, cultural and political means.</li>
<li>Our Constitution, passed in a referendum in 1999, enshrines Environmental Rights and is a pioneer in establishing that it is a right and duty of each generation to protect and maintain the environment for the benefit of itself and the future world. Every person has the individual and collective right to enjoy life and a safe, healthy and ecologically balanced environment. The State will protect the environment, biological diversity, genetic resources, ecological processes, national parks and natural monuments and other areas of particular ecological importance. The genome of living beings cannot be patented, and the law that refers to bioethical principles will regulate matter. It is a fundamental obligation of the State, with the active participation of society, to ensure that the population develops in a pollution-free environment, where air, water, soil, coasts, climate, ozone layer, Living species, are specially protected, in accordance with the law. </li>
<li>The National Economic and Social Development Plan, approved as a National Law in 2013, manifests our desire to transform the country and contribute to saving life on the planet towards a just and sustainable world; Organized on truly democratic international bases and institutions; And oriented to the supreme enduring social happiness and the Good Living.</li>
<li>Climate Change is one of the biggest problems affecting the planet today. It is a problem that transcends the environmental and must be considered in its ethical, economic, social and political dimensions. It is, in fact, one of the clearest manifestations of the crisis of capitalism as a predatory system that makes a healthy, full, solidary and peaceful life on earth impossible.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The fight against Climate Change effectively materializes the confrontation between two models and world views. The developed countries seek to perpetuate the hegemonic schemes that favor them, strengthening the patterns of consumption, production, control, domination and markets that enrich their dominant elites. Developing countries demand the right to eradicate poverty and choose their own forms of development without suffering the consequences and bear the burden generated by the unsustainable levels of consumption of the so-called developed countries.</li>
<li>This struggle has many facets, one of which is developing under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. What is being negotiated there goes far beyond actions for mitigation or adaptation: future power relations are being negotiated based on the use and distribution of energy and the natural elements that will mark the hegemonic structures of the future.</li>
<li>The strategy to combat Climate Change must be effective but also fair and equitable. That is, it must consider historical responsibilities and contribute to reducing inequities that negatively affect many countries and social groups, not to deepen them. The principles and commitments recognized by all countries that are signatories to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change establish ethical and practical bases in this regard, in particular with regard to common but differentiated responsibilities and priorities for development and eradication of poverty for developing countries. To this must be added, as agreed in Rio + 20, the right of each country to freely decide its own forms and ways of sustainable development. The struggle of the developing countries against Climate Change is the struggle for the defense of the Convention, its principles and provisions, is the struggle for life.</li>
<li>It is the peoples, represented by their governments, who have the duty and the responsibility to mediate and balance the interests of the different actors who live in their countries. It is neither possible nor acceptable to delegate state responsibilities in the private sector. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is and should be a country-led convention, not a business round focused on questioned market mechanisms or a space for the enrichment of private enterprise. Each country must decide internally, according to its needs, priorities and development model, as will be articulated efforts with the non-governmental or subnational sectors, to try to impose a uniform scheme for all nations is contrary to national sovereignty.</li>
<li>There is no solution without justice and there can only be justice if the mistakes and abuses of the past are corrected now, in this present that has touched us to live and that will leave its mark in the future. Any agreement behind the backs of justice and the past is a scam to the peoples of the world who have their eyes on us. We must look with optimism, commitment and dignity on the future, with our feet firmly planted in the present, from a clear conscience of justice and history. Climate Change is one of the facets of the global environmental crisis generated by excessive and unsustainable patterns of production and consumption, particularly in developed countries. Therefore, only the modification of these patterns constitutes a true and lasting solution to the environmental crisis and consequently to Climate Change.</li>
<li>Climate Change is one of the facets of the global environmental crisis generated by excessive and unsustainable patterns of production and consumption, particularly in developed countries. Therefore, only the modification of these patterns constitutes a true and lasting solution to the environmental crisis and consequently to Climate Change.</li>
<li>Venezuela, being a country with low altitude zones, island areas, low coastal zones, arid and semi-arid zones, areas exposed to floods, drought and desertification, and areas with fragile mountain ecosystems; In addition to being a developing country whose economy depends particularly on the production, use and export of fossil fuels, all categories established in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change as being highly vulnerable; Is a country particularly sensitive to the adverse effects of Climate Change and the side effects of potential response measures. This vulnerability has become evident in a series of emergencies and natural disasters with severe effects on housing, food production, electricity generation and biological diversity, among others. Faced with this situation, Venezuela has taken large-scale measures to address and protect the affected population, reduce damages and reduce vulnerability at a high cost to the nation.</li>
<li>Although Venezuela is not a country with historical responsibilities in Climate Change, it has embarked on an ambitious series of nationally financed actions with a great impact in repairing losses and damages, adaptation and mitigation. Within the framework of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in relation to Nationally Determined Expected Contributions (INDC), Venezuela, committed to building an eco-socialist productive economic model, presents some of its contributions in this area . These actions are articulated within the framework of the nation's development plan, which proposes the deepening of eco-socialist policies with a high social, economic and environmental impact in the field of Climate Change. Venezuela presents ambitious contributions in adaptation and mitigation, encompassing actions and policies towards a fair and sustainable development. These contributions have been carried out voluntarily and with their own financing. They have not been formally presented until now in the framework of the fight against Climate Change. The Plan of Economic and Social Development of the Nation establishes the priority of the fight against Climate Change in the framework of an integral development, humanist and eco-socialist oriented to Good Living in harmony with Mother Earth.</li>
<li>Venezuela's emissions (0.18Gt CO<sub>2</sub>eq / yr) represent only about 0.48% of global greenhouse gas emissions. However, as part of the policies established in the country's economic and social development plan, Venezuela intends to implement a National Mitigation Plan in conjunction with a National Adaptation Plan. The National Mitigation Plan will aim at reducing the country's emissions by at least 20% by 2030 in relation to the inertial scenario, understood as a hypothetical scenario in which the plan is not implemented. The extent to which this goal is achieved will depend on the fulfillment of the commitments of developed countries in terms of provision of financing, technology transfer and capacity building in accordance with Article 4.7 of the Convention.<p><img src="img/VEN-1.png" width="705" height="437" /></p><p><em>Sources of base information: http://www.worldbank.org/ (Emissions of carbon dioxide derived from the burning of fossil fuels and the manufacture of cement, including carbon dioxide produced by the consumption of solid fuels, liquids, combustible gases and gas burning).</em></p></li>

<li>It is clear, however, that the actions and policies of a single country are not enough. Only if countries with historical responsibilities fully assume these responsibilities through ambitious mitigation targets (between 50 and 70% reduction of current emissions according to the IPCC in its 5th report, estimated likely to increase as knowledge improves) And the reliable, sufficient and predictable provision of means of implementation (financing, technology transfer and capacity-building) to developing countries; We can aspire to a real, just and lasting solution to the problem of Climate Change. This involves establishing global targets for all means of implementation, and monitoring, reporting and verification systems for compliance by developed countries. The means of financing must come from funds   Public and be administered under the Convention according to the priorities and needs established nationally by each country. Technology transfer should be geared to the development and enhancement of endogenous capacities and technologies of developing country Parties (Art. 4.5, UNFCCC) by considering mechanisms for flexibilization of intellectual property rights to make this possible. The new agreement to be signed in Paris should be an agreement based on justice and aimed at deepening the implementation of the Convention under its principles and provisions; To establish ways to pay off the climate debt of developed countries, and to facilitate the realization of the right to development and poverty eradication in developing countries, an agreement that enhances the sustainable, just, equitable and supportive development of the planet.</li>
<li>In accordance with decisions 1 / CP.19 and 1 / CP.20 of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela hereby presents its Nationally Determined Expected Contributions for the fight against Climate Change and its effects. It is important to emphasize, however, that what is agreed upon at COP21-MOP11 in Paris is a critical component of the future climate change scenario in which these contributions will continue to be implemented, which is why Venezuela reserves the right to reconsider its strategies and targets In accordance with what was agreed at COP21-MOP11 and national development priorities.</li>

<h2 id="b.---actions-and-programs-with-impact-on-adaptation-or-mitigation-of-climate-change-and-its-effects">B. - Actions and programs with impact on adaptation or mitigation of Climate Change and its effects</h2>
<p>Venezuela has undertaken a series of actions and programs with important repercussions in the fight against Climate Change and its effects from a perspective of justice and social inclusion. These programs could be deepened and multiplied through the fulfillment of the commitments of provision of means of implementation by developed countries under the Convention. Some are listed below:</p>
<h3 id="industry">INDUSTRY</h3>
<h4 id="oil-industry">Oil Industry</h4>
<ul>
<li>As compensatory measures associated with PDVSA projects and mandated in environmental legislation, the oil industry has carried out the establishment and maintenance of compensatory forests in a total area of ​​14,423 hectares. These agroforestry systems (compensatory, production and protection forests) function as carbon sinks. The validation of the field variables is currently carried out to carry out the estimation of CO<sub>2</sub> fixation. The establishment of an additional 2,184 hectares of Agroforestry Systems is planned for the period 2016-2019.</li>
<li>The industry is currently developing a significant number of projects for the minimization or use of gas burned and / or vented by PDVSA in its exploration and production operations; This implies the adequacy of operations and facilities in terms of infrastructure and facilities for the use of natural gas. It is estimated that a cumulative total of 516 KTon of CO<sub>2</sub>Eq has been discharged into the atmosphere by the use of natural gas over a period of two years. For the period 2016-2019, it is planned to complete future projects, and it is estimated that, thanks to the execution of these projects, the amount of 538.2 KTon CO<sub>2</sub>eq / year will be discharged into the atmosphere.</li>

<li>National Carrier Census: It allows updating the registry of Carriers: labor condition, fleet situation, routes, stops and state of the units. It also involves recording the unmet transportation needs of all communities. To date, 96,500 Carriers have been registered and 3000 communities have been registered. It contemplates the installation of the Technical Mobility Tables: which will bring together all the living forces of each state in order to study the traffic problems and propose their possible solutions. This diagnosis will also allow establishing a map of mobility in each city.</li>
<li>A road construction, rebuilding and maintenance plan has been developed throughout the national territory, with the result that 51 road solutions will have been approved before the end of 2015. These solutions allow traffic decongestion and considerable time reductions in Times of vehicular mobilization, managing to reduce the environmental impact of the vehicular park of the country.</li>
<li>New BRT (Quick Transit Bus) systems have been created in the cities of Maracay, Barquisimeto, Barcelona, Maracaibo, Puerto La Cruz, Merida and Caracas. These special transport systems have exclusive channels, smart stops and security systems with satellite location.</li>
<li>45 new surface public transportation systems have been created with state-of-the-art units that cover 329 new operating routes serving more than 3 million people in 120 cities in the country.</li>
<li>Inauguration of the Yutong Bus Plant, part of the China - Venezuela agreement, with an assembly capacity of 14 modern units per day.</li>
<li>Creation of the Transporter Bank and delivery of state loans to the transport sector through public banks, which has allowed the fleet to be renewed through the delivery of 715 Units to 405 beneficiary lines.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="construction-and-expansion-of-mass-transportation-systems-with-the-consequent-decrease-in-the-use-of-vehicles.">Construction and expansion of Mass Transportation Systems with the consequent decrease in the use of vehicles.</h4>
<ul>
<li>At present, C.A. Metro de Caracas runs a series of expansion projects for Lines, such as Line 5 (12.5 Km and 10 stations) and the Caracas - Guarenas - Guatire System (30 Km and 7 stations). In addition, the renewal and reconditioning of Line 1 is carried out. These works are complemented by two projects, which constitute auxiliary transport solutions to the Metro system, such as the Marquise Metrocable and the Bolivarian Cabletren.</li>
<li>Line II of the Los Teques Metro System, which will run from the Alí Primera Station, located in the El Tambor sector, to San Antonio de los Altos, is currently under construction. It will be 12 kilometers long and will be distributed by six (06) Stations, which will cross the municipalities Guaicaipuro, Carrizal and Los Salias.</li>
<li>Line 2 of the Valencia Metro System is under construction in the capital of Carabobo state, which will have an extension of 4.3 km and will benefit approximately 1,800,000 people.</li>

<h3 id="health">HEALTH</h3>
<h3 id="increased-coverage-in-medical-care"><strong>Increased coverage in medical care</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Before the Bolivarian Revolution in 1999, more than 60% of people living in popular sectors had never seen a doctor for a check-up appointment. In 2015, 12 years have passed since the creation of Barrio Adentro, an unprecedented mission that allows access to high-tech health services free of charge to significant sectors of the population. Barrio Adentro is responsible for at least 704 million 958 thousand free medical visits in the last 12 years.</li>
<li>Barrio Adentro was created in 2003 with the help of the Cuban government to provide health services to the Venezuelan population in small outpatient clinics built and endowed with medical supplies in previously neglected areas. Later Barrio Adentro II was created to expand medical services, with the construction of larger outpatient clinics, and then in 2005 Barrio Adentro III, through which 600 integrated diagnostic centers and 600 integrated rehabilitation rooms were built. In 2006 Barrio Adentro IV began with the inauguration of specialized centers such as the Hospital Cardiológico Infantil in Caracas.</li>
<li>The creation of these health programs imply a reduction of vulnerability to diseases, including those whose incidence and geographical distribution will increase as a result of Climate Change</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="organización-popular-y-participación">POPULAR ORGANIZATION AND PARTICIPATION</h3>
<ul>
<li>The strengthening of social organization in Venezuela is crucial for the reduction of vulnerability to Climate Change. The Communal Census 2013 allowed to quantify throughout the country 40,035 Communal Councils, 1,401 Communes, 1,294 Social Battle Rooms and 28,791 Social Movements, which number 71,521 social organizations. At present, 1377 communes and 45333 communal councils have been registered (Source: Ministry of People's Power for the Communes (2015) statistics.) Accessed on November 2, 2015. Available at http://www.mpcomunas.gob.ve/). The Communes and the Communal Councils are forms of social organization that through processes of territorialization generate actions of reduction of the vulnerability through the self-construction, the organization for the sustainable production and the organization for the life in communities where the transport and the Consumption are reduced by the territorialization and accessible location of services and inputs for life: local schools, markets, health centers, among others.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bioloical-diversity">BIOLOICAL DIVERSITY</h3>
<h4 id="national-strategy-for-biological-diversity">National Strategy for Biological Diversity</h4>
<ul>
<li>Since 2010, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has the National Strategy for the Conservation of Biological Diversity 2010-2020 (ENCDB) and its National Action Plan (PAN), bringing us forward five years to Goal 17 by 2015 of the Strategic Plan Convention on Biological Diversity (Aichi). The ENCDB and its PAN, as part of the Second Socialist Plan for Economic and Social Development of the Nation, sets out the fundamental guidelines that will allow, during this decade, the national articulation for the collective construction of an alternative life model based on sustainability. These instruments represent the methodological, conceptual and political framework aligned to the country project for the sovereign exercise of the conservation and sustainable use of Biodiversity, thus reducing vulnerability to the multiple adverse effects of Climate Change.</li>
<li>The ENCDB and its PAN were built with the simultaneous participation of organized communities, students, groups, teachers, officials and militants, organized in workshops in numerous workshops, which had the participation of more than 5,000 people nationwide. During these meetings debates were generated that allowed the inclusion of the different world visions present in our territory, promoting strategic planning from the local realities and taking advantage of the strengths of the different regions of the country.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="venezuelan-congress-of-biological-diversity">Venezuelan Congress of Biological Diversity</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Venezuelan Congress of Biological Diversity is a space for the meeting of knowledge and the exchange of experiences. Six consecutive years have allowed the consolidation of anti-colonial and sovereign forms of circulation of knowledge, making possible the emergence of new actors and actors that produce knowledge in dialogue. The dialogue between different matrices of rationality, the complementarity of life itself, the recognition of diversity and the exchange of experiences are the premises on which these congresses are held.</li>
<li>In turn, this space works as a mechanism for socializing knowledge about biological diversity from different perspectives and perspectives. The congress is part of the National Strategy for the Conservation of Biological Diversity 2010-2020, with the aim of socializing knowledge and promoting inclusion and social justice. This congress also functions as a mechanism to monitor the strategy itself and its plan and has been consolidated as an annual space for the exchange of knowledge and experiences on the conservation of biological diversity with social commitment. This periodic event is supported by a ministerial resolution, which seeks to ensure its continuity. This national event has become a meeting place between institutions, collectives, producers, producers of science, community members, community members, militants, amateurs, amateurs and all the different actors involved in the preservation of life and good living , Including adaptation to Climate Change. To date, approximately 11919 people have participated.</li>

<h3 id="food-sovereignty-and-sustainable-agriculture">FOOD SOVEREIGNTY AND SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE</h3>
<p>One of the sectors that are most strongly impacted by Climate Change is the food production sector. The promotion of agroecological systems based on sustainability and respect for natural ecosystem processes, urban and periurban agricultural systems and the prevention of climatic risks are very effective measures to adapt to Climate Change. Some actions and programs are listed below:</p>
<h4 id="network-of-laboratories-of-biological-inputs">Network of laboratories of biological inputs:</h4>
<ul>
<li>There are 28 laboratories for the production of biological inputs (bio-controllers and biofertilizers) at the national level to replace the use of agrochemicals. Protocols have been developed for the management of biological inputs for seed production, as well as plans for planting maize, legumes and vegetables. This network of laboratories is under the responsibility of the National Institute of Integral Agricultural Health (INSAI).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="conservation-of-agrobiodiversity">Conservation of agrobiodiversity: </h4>
<ul>
<li>Six annual Biodiversity Congresses have been held under a ministerial decree, where topics related to cultural and biological diversity are discussed. It is a relevant contribution the discussion to strengthen the organization of social movements around the valuation, conservation, reproduction and distribution of peasant, indigenous and afro-descendant seeds. In the same vein, a peasant, indigenous, intellectual and cultural movement has been strengthened. Its articulating axis is the protection of biological and cultural diversity associated with seeds, as a defense against climate change, and that it carries out organizational activities , Audiovisual material dissemination, training and production of foods and seeds with high organizational balances, in rural and urban areas supported by Venezuelan institutions.</li>
<li>Experiences of rescue of potatoes and other native Andean crops have been carried out and incorporated these varieties to the national plans and public policies on seed.</li>
