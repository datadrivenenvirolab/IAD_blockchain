<h2><strong>The Republic of the Marshall Islands Nationally Determined Contribution </strong></h2>
<p><strong>22 November 2018 </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Introduction </strong></h2>
<p>The Republic of the Marshall Islands (<em><strong>RMI</strong></em>) is committed to the full, effective, and transparent implementation of the Paris Agreement in accordance with its provisions and the relevant Decisions of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (<em><strong>COP</strong></em>) and the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (<em><strong>CMA</strong></em>).</p>
<p>RMI hereby communicates to the UNFCCC:</p>

<ul>
<li>an update to its existing Nationally Determined Contribution (<em><strong>NDC</strong></em>) pursuant to Article 4.11 of the Paris Agreement that includes a revised and more ambitious binding 2025 target; and</li>
<li>a new NDC pursuant to Decision 1/CP.21 paragraph 23 that includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>a new binding 2030 target; o a new indicative 2035 target; o a reaffirmation of its aspiration to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 at the latest;</li>
<li>up-front information in tabular format to facilitate clarity, transparency and understanding;</li>
<li>a commitment to produce a National Adaptation Plan; and o a commitment to submit an Adaptation Communication to the UNFCCC.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>RMI reserves the right to conduct further domestic consultations with a view to improving this NDC in accordance with Article 4.11 of the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>The context and long-term vision for this NDC is set out in RMI’s <em>Tile Til Eo</em> 2050 Climate Strategy, September 2018. A copy of that strategy is annexed.</p>
