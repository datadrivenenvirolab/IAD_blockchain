<p>Updated Nationally Determined Contribution of the Republic of Moldova</p>

<h1 id=1. "introduction">1. Introduction </h1>
<p>The Republic of Moldova is fully committed to the Paris Agreement’s objectives on:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 °C; and</p></li>
<li><p>increasing the ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In this respect, the country has undertaken the appropriate measures. The cores to these are nationally determined contributions (NDCs). The Republic of Moldova’s INDC (NDC1) was submitted on 25 September 2015. The decision 1/CP.21 requests those Parties whose intended nationally determined contribution pursuant to decision 1/CP.20 contains a time frame up to 2030 to communicate or update by 2020 these contributions and to do so every five years thereafter pursuant to Article 4, paragraph 9, of the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>The Republic of Moldova hereby communicates its updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC2) and the accompanying information to facilitate clarity, transparency, and understanding, with reference to Decision 4/CMA.1.</p>
<p>The Republic of Moldova has included in its updated NDC the adaptation component in line with Articles 2.1 and 7.1 of the Paris Agreement and Katowice Rulebook (COP 24), as an opportunity to communicate country’s strategic vision on climate change adaptation. The adaptation component, as a forward-looking document, incorporates country’s adaptation priorities that derive from the in-force policy documents, such as the Climate Change Adaptation Strategy and the Action Plan for its implementation (2014), as well as from the Fourth National Communication to the UNFCCC (2018), and from a number of national level policy documents covering cross-sectoral socioeconomic areas and sector-specific development documents of the national priority sectors: agriculture, water resources , human health, forestry, energy and transport.</p>
<p>The component is built upon the experience gained from the implementation of the first cycle of the National Adaptation Plan (NAP-1) (2014-2017) that is presented in the document, and from the planning perspectives of the NAP-2 that is to be implemented in two tracks:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>National Adaption Plan, covering Water Resources, Human Health, Forestry, Energy and Transport; </p></li>
<li><p> Agriculture Sectoral Adaptation Plan (Ag.SAP).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In support to climate action, the adaptation component incorporates cross-sectorial and sector-specific adaptation actions and measures to be implemented, along with identified adaptation investment priorities based on the review of national and sectorial development policies and plans, and the outcomes of an extensive consultation process, including stakeholders from all sectors and levels of governance, in particular, Central Public Authorities and Local Public Authorities, climate-related institutions and agencies, along with private sector, civil society, academia and women associations and youth NGOs representatives.</p>
<p>The Republic of Moldova’s medium- and long-term adaptation goal is to reach a sustainable social and economic development resilient to the impact of climate change by establishing a strong enabling environment for a coherent and effective adaptive action with mitigation benefits, integrating climate risk into investment decision- making and business planning, while remaining socially inclusive and sensitive to gender impacts of climate change.</p>
<p>As such, the whole of the Republic of Moldova’s adaptation framework makes a contribution to the country’s sustainable development priorities embodied in the <em>“National Development Strategy: Moldova 2030” (2019)</em> and to the overarching adaptation goal of the Paris Agreement to enhance adaptive capacity and resilience, to reduce vulnerability, with a view to contributing to sustainable development, and ensuring an adequate adaptation response in the context of the goal of holding average global warming well below 2 degrees C and pursuing efforts to keep it below 1.5 degrees C.</p>
<h1 id="mitigation">2. Mitigation </h1>
<p>In its updated NDC (NDC2), the Republic of Moldova intends to achieve more ambitious targets than in its NDC1. The country’s new economy-wide unconditional target is to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 70 per cent below its 1990 level in 2030, instead of 64-67 per cent as committed in NDC1.</p>
<p>As to the new economy-wide conditional target, instead of 78 per cent as committed in NDC1, the reduction commitment expressed above could be increased in NDC2 up to 88 per cent below 1990 level, provided a global agreement addressing important topics including low-cost financial resources, technology transfer, and technical cooperation, accessible to all at a scale commensurate to the challenge of global climate change, is insured.</p>
<p>Following the decisions 1/CP.21, 4/CMA.1, 9/CMA.1, 18/CMA.1, the following quantifiable information is hereby submitted:</p>

<p>The noted difference between NDC1 and NDC2, in the latest, is due to the full transition from Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines to 2006 IPCC Guidelines, also due to switch from IPCC AR2’s GWP values to the use of GWP values provided in IPCC AR4, based on the effects over a 100-year time-horizon of GHGs, as well as due to undertaken recalculations as result of using higher tier methodologies, revised values of country-specific and default emission factors, actualized time-series of activity data and due to considering into the national GHG inventory new emissions and sinks categories, etc.</p>

<p>Republic of Moldova is committed to an unconditional target of 70 per cent reduction of its net greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 as compared to 1990 levels, instead of 64-67 per cent committed in NDC1.</p>
<p>The GHG reduction commitment could be increased up to 88 per cent reduction as compared to 1990 level conditional to the global agreement addressing important issues, including access to low-cost financial resources, technology transfer and technical cooperation commensurate to the challenge of global climate change. In NDC1 this commitment was established at the level of 78 per cent GHG emission reduction.</p>
<p>Thus, following the Art. 4.3 of the Paris Agreement, the Republic of Moldova’s NDC2 reflects its highest possible ambition and represents progress beyond commitments made in NDC1.</p>

<p>Most of the adaptation actions specified under agriculture, forestry, transport and energy sectors have a clear impact on mitigation. However, the evaluation of such positive and negative co-benefits is not done because currently the appropriate methodologies are not available. CDM methodologies could be applied, but they are too time consuming and require increased human resources which are scarce in current conditions of the country, while own national methodologies have not been developed yet.</p>
<p>However, while it is premature to determine mitigation co-benefits from adaptation actions for projection purposes, the country is reporting and will continue to report data and information on quantified co-benefits of adaptation actions in its NCs and BURs, in compliance with Government Decision (GD) No. 1277 as of 26.12.2018 on setting-up and functioning of the National System for Monitoring and Reporting (NSMR) GHG Emissions and Other Information Relevant to Climate Change, thus respecting transparency requirements and the requirement on preventing double counting of GHG emissions.</p>

<p>Best practices and experience in NDC development:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The experience gained during the elaboration and approval of NDC1 served as a main support in the development and promotion of NDC2;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NDC2 formulation was done under the leadership of the Ministry of Agriculture, Regional Development and Environment, with the financial support of the European Union (EU) in the frame of the Regional Project EU4Climate, implemented by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The draft NDC2 was posted for comments on &lt;<a href="http://www.clima.md/"><span class="underline">www.clima.md</span>&gt;</a> and it was discussed and validated during the national consultation workshop organized on 28 January 2020, with the participation of all relevant stakeholders, including representatives of the central and local public authorities, academia, civil society organizations, private entities, business associations;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The NDC2 targets are planned to be achieved through the Low Emission Development Strategy of the Republic of Moldova until 2030 and the Action Plan for its implementation, approved through the GD No. 1470 as of 30.12.2016 (it will be updated by the end of 2020 to incorporate more ambitious reduction commitments from NDC2);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The NDC2 unconditional target is foreseen to be reached by implementing the efficient incentives, redirecting public investments to less emission intensive activities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In respect to NDC2 conditional target, financial support is envisaged from relevant donors, mostly from Green Climate Fund (GCF); currently, the Country Programme of the Republic of Moldova for engagement with GCF for the 2020-2024 years is under consideration for approval; a comprehensive assessment of country’s capacity, financial and technology needs is conducted to implement a pipeline of measures to mitigate and adapt to climate change;</p>

<p>Metrics applied: Republic of Moldova intends to use the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) Global Warming Potential (GWP) 100-year values to calculate and report its CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent totals. The Republic of Moldova will take into account future updates to GWP values by IPCC.</p>
<p>Methodologies for estimating emissions: 2006 IPCC Guidelines.</p>
<p>Approach to accounting for agriculture, forestry and other land use: Republic of Moldova intends to include all categories of GHG emissions by sources and removals by sinks, and all pools and gases, as reported in the National Inventory of GHG Emissions and Sinks; to account for the land sector using a net-net approach; and to use a “production approach” to account for harvested wood products, which is consistent with IPCC guidelines. Republic of Moldova may also exclude emissions from natural disturbances, as consistent with available IPCC guidance. There are material data collection and methodological challenges in estimating emissions and removals in the land sector. In compliance with 2006 IPCC Guidelines, Republic of Moldova will continue to improve its LULUCF sector GHG reporting, which will involve an update of its methodologies.</p>
<p>Contribution of international mechanisms: Republic of Moldova may use bilateral, regional and international market mechanisms to achieve its conditional 2030 target, subject to employing robust systems that deliver real and verified emissions reductions. However, according to EU 2016 evaluation report on the implementation of the EU-RM Association Agreement the implementation of the EU emissions trading scheme in RM will only be possible when the date of RM's accession to the EU is determined. The unconditional NDC2 commitment will be met through domestic actions, although they would need assistance in costeffective implementation. In order to prevent double counting of GHG emissions, an appropriate robust national MRV system was put in place in 2019 through the GD No. 1277 as of 26.12.2018. It covers GHG emissions counting from international bunkers and CDM projects as well, while delivering real and verified emission reduction.</p>

<p>Following the Talanoa Call for Action<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, launched by the Presidents of COP 23 and COP 24, the Republic of Moldova made its NDC2 more ambitious than NDC1, and stated the target to reduce its GHG emissions by 70 per cent below its 1990 level by 2030 under the unconditional scenario, instead of 64-67 per cent, thus showing its alignment to the “ratchet up mechanism” of the Paris Agreement. Another issue that proves country’s NDC2 ambitions refers to the application of an economy-wide absolute emission reduction target (in compliance with Article 4.4 of Paris Agreement), which ensures reaching the objectives in a relevant, complete, consistent, transparent, and accurate manner.</p>
<p>National commitments are well in line with the emissions pathways towards 2050 that correspond to keeping global warming below 2<sup>o</sup>C as compared to pre-industrial levels.</p>
<p>It is worthwhile to note that considerations of fairness in the national perspective include a variety of issues and no separate indicator on its own can accurately reflect fairness or a globally equitable distribution of countries’ efforts.</p>
<p>It is further important to note that the evolving nature of a country’s circumstances is to be reflected in the consideration of fairness:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Responsibility is reflected in a country’s past, current and future greenhouse gas emissions. Total emissions, as well as per capita emissions, are to be considered.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Republic of Moldova’s responsibility in terms of GHG emissions is low. In 2016, Republic of Moldova emitted 14.6 Mt (without LULUCF) and 13.7 Mt (with LULUCF), which is less than 0.026 per cent of current world’s emissions.</p>
<p>In 2016, the total and net per capita emissions were almost 50 per cent lower than the world’s average (3.8 t CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent per capita to be compared to 6.8 t CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent per capita, respectively 3.6 t CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent per capita to be compared to 7.4 t CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent per capita).</p>
<p>Also, the Republic of Moldova has a low level of historic emissions, of about 0.05 per cent (without LULUCF) and/or of about 0.04 per cent (with LULUCF) of the worlds’ emissions, since 1990.</p>
<ul>

<li><p>The capacity to contribute to solving the climate change problem is closely related to the ability to invest in appropriate mitigation measures. Hence, oneaspect of capacity is to take into account the GDP growth level and GDP per capita in fairness considerations.</p>
<p>In this context, it is worth mentioning that over the 1990-2016 period, the Real GDP decreased in the Republic of Moldova by 27.7 per cent, from 10.133 to 7.327 billion 2010 US$, while the real GDP per capita decreased by 17.9 per cent, from 2,323 to 1,906 2010 US$<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li><p> The mitigation potential and abatement costs are other core issues in considering a fair contribution of a country.</p></li>

<p>The GHG intensity (“CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per GDP”) indices have considerably decreased over the 1990-2016 period in the Republic of Moldova, from 4.43 to 1.99 kg CO<sub>2</sub> per real GDP 2010 US$ (without LULUCF), or by 55.1 per cent; and, from 4.28 to 1.86 kg CO<sub>2</sub> per real GDP 2010 US$ (with LULUCF), or by 56.5 per cent, respectively.</p>
<p>These values are still among the highest among transition economies from the Central and Eastern Europe and reveal a high mitigation potential of the Republic of Moldova to reach its GHG emission reduction targets. But, in order to reach the conditional target of up to 88 per cent reduction of its GHG emissions by 2030 as compared to 1990 levels, appropriate international financial support equal to about US$ 5 billion, i.e. about US$ 500 million per year until 2030, is needed; the support needed will be in addition to the domestic allocations to cover the required abatement costs.</p>
<p>This support will allow adjusting the development pathway of the Republic of Moldova towards a low-carbon economy, thus moving towards progressive decoupling of carbon emissions from economic growth and ensuring a decent level of real GDP per capita, equaling 4,072 US$/capita in 2030, which will still be approximately one-tenth of EU 28 average, projected to be US$ 43,244/capita<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> in 2030.</p>
<p>As stated above, along with the international financial support for covering abatement costs, the country will also need assistance in the form of technology transfer and capacity building.</p>

<p>Over the period 2000-2010, the Republic of Moldova recorded on the average an increase in GHG emissions of about 3.4 per cent/year, while during the 2010-2016 period – only 0.12 per cent/year, to account for GDP per capita growth of 6.1 per cent/year over the same period, which clear proves moving trend towards progressive decoupling of carbon emissions from economic growth and the country’s intention to reach the decarburization of its economy as soon as possible and in a sustainable development manner, in accordance with the best available science, so as to achieve at the global level a balance between anthropogenic GHG emissions by sources and removals by sinks in the second half of this century, on the basis of equity, and in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty, which was calculated to be 9 per cent in 2015, while the subjective perception of this indicator by the population was 37 per cent<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a><sup>.</sup></p>

<p><strong>2.2. CLARIFYING INFORMATION ON MITIGATION ASPECTS IN THE REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA</strong></p>
<p>The Republic of Moldova’s share in global GHG emissions is less than 0.026 per cent. In 2016, total and net
GHG emissions of the Republic of Moldova equaled 13.7 Mt (with LULUCF) and 14.6 Mt CO<sub>2</sub> eq. (without LULUCF) (see Table 2.2-1) and total and net per capita emissions were almost half of the world’s average (3.6 t CO<sub>2</sub> eq. /capita vs 7.4 t CO<sub>2</sub> eq. /capita, and 3.8 t CO<sub>2</sub> eq. /capita vs 6.8 t CO<sub>2</sub> eq. /capita, respectively).</p>

<p>In 2016, about 72.7 per cent of the national net direct GHG emissions originated from the Energy Sector. Other relevant direct GHG sources were represented by Agriculture Sector (17.8 per cent of the total), Waste Sector (10.7 per cent of the total) and IPPU Sector (5.6 per cent of the total). The share of Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry Sector was -6.7 per cent (see Figure 2.2-1).</p>

<p>The significant reduction in the level of socio-economic indicators over the 1990-2016 period is a consequence of the deep transformation processes common during the transition from a centralized economy to a market economy, specifically after the breakup of the Soviet Union and the declaration of the Republic of Moldova’s independence on 27th of August 1991.</p>
<p>The country rated among the low-medium income countries in 1990, and currently it is one of the lowest income nations in Europe. Certain economic decline patterns had been registered prior to 1991, but the separation from the USSR has considerably accelerated the process.</p>
<p>The GDP level was decreasing continuously over the period 1990 to 2000 inclusively, when it fell down to as low as 65 per cent of the 1990 level. The reasons for the economic collapse were numerous. First, the country had been fully integrated in the USSR economic system, and the independence resulted, among other things, in the cessation of any subsidies or cash transfers from the centralized government. Second, the end of the Soviet Era with its well established commercial links has resulted in the emergence of numerous obstacles for free movement of goods, and in access restrictions introduced by the emerging markets. Third, the lack of domestic energy resources and raw materials in the country has contributed considerably to the nation’s strong dependence on other former Soviet Republics.</p>
<p>This dependence has affected consumers’ capacity to pay for the energy used due to the increased prices of energy resources (ex., from 1997 to 2014 the natural gas tariff increased 13.0 times; electricity tariff increased 6.6 times; gasoline, diesel and liquefied gases prices increased 1.9 times), in the condition when about 95% of energy resources were imported. On the other hand, without applying cross subsidizations policies, the current energy prices have incentivized the population to take strong energy efficiency measures in the Republic of Moldova, which led to a significant decrease of the energy intensity, declining since 2000 with an average annual negative growth of 4.5 per cent.</p>
<p>In addition, over the 2000-2016 period, the real GDP increased by 107.9 per cent, from 3.524 to 7.327 billion 2010 US$, while the real GDP per capita increased by 132.8 per cent, from 818.8 to 1,906.1 2010 US$. The considerable real GDP growth achieved since 2000 seems to indicate that the economy is finally developing in the right direction, although it should be noted that in 2016 the real GDP reached only 72.3 per cent of the 1990-year level. It is worth mentioning that from 2000 to 2016, the electricity consumption increased in the Republic of Moldova by 15.9 per cent; the heat consumption decreased by 19.4 per cent, the consumption of primary energy resources increased by 50.7 per cent; while the GHG intensity (CO<sub>2</sub> eq/GDP) decreased during the same period by 39.7 per cent, showing the first signs of decoupling of economic growth from the growth in greenhouse gas emissions, by 25.4 per cent over the 2000-2016 period (see Figure 2.2-3).</p>

<p><em>Mitigation Policy Framework</em></p>
<p>In 2015, the Republic of Moldova submitted its INDC (NDC1). On 24 March 2017 the country’s Low Emission Development Strategy until 2030 and the Action Plan for its implementation, approved through the GD No. 1470 as of 30.12.2016, entered into force, aiming to reach the NDC1 targets. The Paris Agreement was ratified by the Law No. 78 as of 04.05.2017.</p>
<p>In order to implement NDC2, it is necessary to update the LEDS by the end of the 2020 year. Concomitantly, the 2050 Low Emission Development Strategy will be developed by November 2022 according to the Governmental Action Plan for 2020-2023 years, approved through the GD No. 636 as of 11.12.2019. It will be focused specifically on outlining the policies for accelerating reducing GHG emissions by mid-century, as stipulated by Article 4.1 of the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>NDC2 is based on national development priorities oriented towards reaching Sustainable Development Goals expressed in the draft National Development Strategy “Moldova 2030” planned to be approved during 2020.</p>
<p>In September 2015, the Republic of Moldova, together with another 192 UN member states, pledged to implement the Sustainable Development Agenda 2030 by adopting the Statement on Sustainable Development at the Summit held in New York.</p>
<p>Thus, the Republic of Moldova stays committed to and striving for an ambitious international agreement on climate change in line with recommendations by science to maintain the average global temperature increase below two degrees Celsius.</p>

<p><strong>3.1. CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION STRATEGIC VISION AND GOAL, SUPPORTING INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND POLICY FRAMEWORK</strong></p>
<p><strong>3.1.1 INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS, GOVERNANCE AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK
</strong></p>


<p>In the Republic of Moldova, climate change adaptation (CCA) planning and implementation is a shared responsibility and requires involvement by line Ministries of the Government, their subordinated agencies, Local Public Authorities, private sector, civil society. However, the nature of involvement varies across these stakeholders.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Agriculture, Regional Development and Environment (MARDE) of the Republic of Moldova is the state authority vested with the power to develop and promote policies and strategies addressing climate change, environmental protection, rational use of natural resources and biodiversity conservation; to identify priorities; to develop and promote national programs and action plans which address such priorities; coordinate relevant actions and monitor their implementation in the best way; to promote the state policy and determine the priority directions of climate change and environmental research and development; to ensure international collaboration in climate change and environmental protection; to collect, systematize and manage own information database in support to own activities; to ensure maintenance and optimization of the sector information system, other environment and climate-related responsibilities.</p>
<p>On behalf of the Government of the Republic of Moldova, the MARDE is responsible for implementation of international climate change and environment related treaties to which the Republic of Moldova is a Party (including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, signed by the Republic of Moldova on June 12, 1992, ratified by the Parliament on March 16, 1995, as well as the Kyoto Protocol, ratified by the Republic of Moldova on February 13, 2003, the official date of accession being April 22, 2003).</p>
<p>The <em>National Climate Change Commission</em> <em>(NCCC)</em> will chair the <em>Climate Change Coordination Mechanism</em> <em>(CCCM)</em> in cross-sectorial coordination of all climate-related components: adaptation, GHG emissions and mitigation and is to be operationalized through a dedicated Government Decision. The purpose of the multistakeholder CCCM is to foster the dialogue, coordination, collaboration and coherence among sectors, leverage and oversight the reporting on climate change planning and actions by all stakeholders. The established multi-stakeholder partnership is foreseen to contribute to a common understanding in climate planning, improved rationality and effectiveness of policymaking, to facilitate the implementation of climate action, to have contribution to the sustainability of climate governance. Cross-sectorial coordination will enhance also the transparency in the implementation of prioritized adaptation measures.</p>
<p>The NCCC is seen as a permanent formalized body with the highest representation of key stakeholders: sectorial ministries, NGOs, academia, research, private sector, taking into consideration gender dimension through including representatives of women’s associations and considering gender equality and social inclusion in all supervising activities of NCCC. Such organizational structure of NCCC comprises actors of horizontal, inter-sectorial planning and of vertical integration, with the representation of bellow sectorial/ national level, thus ensuring a multi-level framework with interactions between government and civil society representatives. The NCCC will have a Secretariat as a technical executive body.</p>
<p>At the sector level, the NCCC is supported by the sectorial administration in charge of the development of sector-specific climate change enabling environment and reporting on climate action, establishing working groups or nominate focal points. Technical Committees on specific thematic areas will be established ad-hoc when the need in advanced thematic expertise will be required, in particular during the consideration of donor project proposals. Such need will be met by the recruitment of mitigation or adaptation experts. The Commission will coordinate also previously initiated actions, which have not been completed under the Kyoto Protocol. Through the proposed structure of the CCCM, the Republic of Moldova overcomes the issue of limited integration and connectivity between levels, which is an impediment to the effective decision-making process in adaptation and mitigation. A dedicated Government Decision (under approval) will enact the <em>Climate Change Coordination Mechanism</em>.</p>
<p><em>The Climate Change Adaptation Strategy of the Republic of Moldova</em> and its implementation <em>Action Plan (CCAS, 2014)</em><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a><em>,</em> provides for an integrated vision of the Republic of Moldova's development opportunities and the ability to respond in a resilient way to the impact of climate change. The objectives of the CCAS are oriented towards increasing the country’s capacity to adapt and respond to actual or potential climate change effects and it is underpinned by an in-depth study of future climate risks and their impacts on vulnerable sectors. The CCAS and its implementation Action Plan<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> serve as an umbrella strategy that creates an enabling environment for Central and Local Public Authorities to integrate CCA and risk management into existing and future strategies through a range of sectorial and local actions. The sectorial approach in climate change adaptation in the Republic of Moldova is prevailing at the current stage of the country's development, while cross-sectorial and sub-national approaches are becoming increasingly important. Some sectors are already implementing adaptation actions, while others need more support in adaptation planning and implementation.</p>
<p>While the objectives stated in the CCAS are still valid, the associated Action Plan covers the timeframe 20142020. For this reason, new adaptation planning, implementation and investment priorities identified through a wide stakeholder consultation process associated within a number of recent events (development of Fourth National Communication to UNFCCC, second cycle of NAP, Country Programme for the engagement with GCF) are incorporated into the current, updated vision on climate change adaptation, validated during a participatory process entailing climate-relevant stakeholders.</p>
<h3 id="climate-change-adaptation-vision-and-goal">CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION VISION AND GOAL </h3>
<p>The Republic of Moldova’s climate change adaptation vision incorporates the concept of integrating climate adaptation into medium- and long-term development planning to foster adaptation action, enhancing climate risks into investment decision- making and business planning with the aim of increasing the resilience of economic sectors, land use and ecosystems and accelerating country’s transition towards low carbon and resilient development.</p>
<p>A further advance in medium- and long-term adaptation planning in a coherent and strategic manner is seen through an iterative socially inclusive and gender-sensitive <em>National Adaptation Planning (NAP)</em> process. This commitment is to be reinforced via the approval of the above-mentioned dedicated Government Decision (2020), which will also institutionalize the coordination and oversight of both adaptation planning and implementation through the cross-sectorial multi-stakeholder <em>Climate Change Coordination Mechanism</em> chaired by the <em>NCCC</em>. As such, the NAP process is seen as a practical approach to vertical and horizontal decision-making, which also facilitates the integration of top-down assessments of climatic risks with bottomup planning of adaptation needs, options and priorities.</p>
<p>Through the NAP process components, the Republic of Moldova establishes an evidence-based framework that makes adaptation planning socially inclusive, gender-responsive and flexible process, while also supporting priority adaptation actions in the most climate-vulnerable sectors and areas.</p>
<p>The sectorial approach in climate change adaptation planning of the Republic of Moldova derives from the CCAS that sets out the priority sectors of adaptation and promotes actions to reduce climate impact through strengthened institutional capacities at national, sectorial and local levels, improved knowledge management, convergent approach in climate change adaptation and disaster risks reduction. Therefore, the NAP process promotes gradual mainstreaming of adaptation into planning, budgeting and decision-making of Agriculture, Human Health, Water Resources, Forestry, Energy and Transport sectors. Although the technical and financial requirements to build climate change resilience across economic sectors are still being assessed, it is already clear, that it will require significant effort and mobilization of innovative solutions, financial resources, institutional capacity and political will for effective adaptation action.</p>
<p>The Republic of Moldova’s climate change adaptation approach incorporates also the aspects of most vulnerable socio-economic and natural systems, population groups, urban and rural communities, in which critical issues are found and which require a coherent and wide response to climate risks and vulnerabilities through transformative adaptation interventions. The NCCC is to provide effective leadership needed for transformative changes with consideration of the critical role of sub-national authorities and local organizations in these changes.</p>
<p>In support of climate action, the Government of the Republic of Moldova strives to create an effective enabling environment for attracting climate investments in adaptation priority areas. Technologically innovative solutions, new business models are expected to be deployed by international donors, investors and the country’s private sector in resilient infrastructure and nature-based solutions.</p>
<p>To facilitate this process, adaptation investment priorities were identified based on the review of national and sectorial development policies and plans, along with the results of an extensive consultation process ensured by a wide representation of stakeholders across sectors and levels of governance, in particular, CPAs, LPAs, private sector, civil society, academia and women associations representatives that accounted for different types of knowledge in the area of climate change adaptation. The current list of adaptation investment areas is the outcome of Republic of Moldova Country Programme for the engagement with GCF carried out in a country-driven participative modality, ensuring transparency of each step of the appraisal process. The list of adaptation investment priorities will be updated as needed, but not less than once per year, within a stakeholder participatory process, using relevant prioritization approaches.</p>
<p><em>Based on the above-stated vision, the Republic of Moldova’s medium- and long-term adaptation goal is to reach a sustainable social and economic development resilient to the impact of climate change by establishing a strong enabling environment for a coherent and effective adaptive action with mitigation benefits, integrating climate risk into investment decision- making and business planning, while remaining socially inclusive and sensitive to gender impacts of climate change.</em></p>
<p>As such, the whole of the Republic of Moldova’s adaptation framework makes a contribution to the country’s sustainable development priorities embodied in the <em>“National Development Strategy: Moldova 2030”</em> and to the overarching adaptation goal of the Paris Agreement to enhance adaptive capacity and resilience, to reduce vulnerability, with a view to contributing to sustainable development, and ensuring an adequate adaptation response in the context of the goal of holding average global warming well below 2 degrees C and pursuing efforts to keep it below 1.5 degrees C.</p>

<p>The three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) project similar temperature in the near-term decades +0.9 - 1.1°C over the Republic of Moldova (RM) geographical territory. Only starting around 2050s the three emissions scenarios produce temperature patterns distinguishable from each other. This is due to both the big inertia of the climate system, and also due to the time taken for the full climate effects of greenhouse gas emissions to be observed, along with the different emission scenarios to produce large differences in greenhouse gas concentrations.</p>
<p>Annual changes for temperatures are very homogeneous over the RM’s Agro-Ecologic Zones (AEZs). By the 2080s, the rate of warming is higher under the RCP8.5, on the average it reaches +4.6°C; medium under the RCP4.5, +2.4°C, and smaller under the RCP2.6 scenarios, ensembles average would be +1.3°C (Figure 3.2-1).</p>
<p>All used GCM models agree that for the three future periods (2016–2035, 2046–2065 and 2081–2100) an increase of the winter temperature is expected, as compared to the 1986–2005 baseline period. The warming would be higher during winter up to +4.6°C over Northern AEZ, but in Central and Southern AEZ's temperature rise will be lower up to +4.2°C according to the RCP8.5. The RCP2.6 reveals less intense warming over the RM’s AEZs from +1.2 to +1.4°C. The corresponding results from the RCP4.5 scenario show medium intense differences in temperature increase. Estimates of simulations from the RCP4.5 scenario show that the warming will be quite uniform +2.5-2.6°C by the 2081-2100 throughout all AEZs.</p>

<p>Figure 3.2-1: Projected CMIP5 21 GCMs ensemble annual mean air temperature, °C development throughout the Republic of Moldova<em>.</em></p>
<p>The summer warming is found to be even higher than the winter one, however, the spatial distribution of the changes is quite different. The strongest temperature rise occurs over Southern and Central AEZs. The ensemble, driven by RCP8.5, estimates that the RM AEZs will experience the most significant warming during summer, from +5.9 in Northern AEZ up to +6.1°C over Southern AEZ by 2100. The pattern of change derived from the RCP2.6 scenario is quite similar, but the magnitude of change is lower, from +1.3 to +1.5°C. The corresponding results from the RCP4.5 show medium intensity differences in temperature increase. Estimates of simulations from the RCP4.5 ensembles show that the warming will be quite uniform, +2.9°C, by the 20812100 over the all RM’s AEZs.</p>
<p>Projections of Future Changes in Annual and Seasonal Precipitation: The RCP8.5 and RCP2.6 project a slight precipitation increase of about 0.6-2% over all of the RM’s AEZs by 2016-2035 time period. Conversely, according to RCP4.5 a slight decrease in precipitation from 1.5% to 2% is projected for Northern and Central AEZs in comparison to the reference period (1986-2005). Annual changes in precipitation became much more differentiated over the RM’s AEZs by 2100. The multi-model projections from the RCP8.5 show that the RM’s AEZs would show a general annual decrease in precipitation varying from 9.9% in Northern AEZ to 13.4% to Southern AEZ (Figure 3.2-2). Conversely, according to RCP2.6, a moderate increase in precipitation from 3.1% in Northern AEZ to 5.1% to Southern AEZ by 2100 is projected. The corresponding results from the RCP4.5 show a moderate increase in precipitation from 1.6% to 3.6% only in Central and Northern AEZs by 2100 relative to the reference time period 1986-2005.</p>
<p>The ensemble averages for the three RCP scenarios show that the precipitation reduction will be much more extended in the Republic of Moldova during summer and autumn. The drying conditions are expected to characterize all the country’s regions.</p>

<p>The ensemble projections forced by RCP8.5 project the greatest summer rainfall reduction, by 25.1% in Central AEZ and the lowest one, by 18.1%, in Northern AEZ. For the 2081-2100 timespan, the pattern for ensemble projection forced by RCP4.5 is quite similar but the magnitude of changes is lower, decreasing from 13.2% to</p>
<p>7.4% with a maximum seen again over Central AEZ and the minimum - over Northern AEZ, relative to the 19862005 reference time period.</p>
<p>Projections of Future Changes in Temperature Extremes Indices: Table 3.2-2 displays the distribution of projected CMIP5 14 GCMs ensemble changes in temperature extreme indices covering 2081–2100 period, relative to the 1986–2005 climatological baseline period. The annual minimum daily minimum temperature (TNn), maximum daily maximum temperature (TXx), warm nights (TN90p), warm days TX90p, Tropical nights (TR), and summer days (SU) indices are projected to increase according to all three RCPs, with stronger warming under RCP8.5 in the RM AEZs. However, a decrease in the annual cold nights (TN10p), cold days (TX10p), Frost days (FD), and Ice days (ID) indices is excepted by the end of the twenty-first century under all three scenarios, with strong agreement among models.</p>
<p>The projected changes in temperature duration indices are consistent with what would be expected from warming and changes in absolute and threshold indices. That is, the Cold Spell Duration Index (CSDI) is projected to decrease and the Warm Spell Duration Index (WSDI) - to increase. The projected trend of increase in WSDI is much larger under RCP8.5, by 1.5 days/year (129 days) than under RCP2.6, by 0.15 days/year (27 days). The projected trend of decrease in CSDI is more comparable under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 with the median projected decrease of about 3 days (Southern AEZ) and 5 days (Northern AEZ).</p>
<p>Changes in nighttime temperature indices, TN10p and TN90p, are projected to be stronger than those in daytime temperature indices, TX10p and TX90p. A TN10p and TX10p decrease is expected of about 4% (RCP2.6) and/or 7% (RCP8.5) by the end of this century. Projections from different models converge as the projection approaches the zero-exceedance rate (all models project fewer and fewer cold nights and days toward the end of the century).</p>
<p>For the TN90p and TX90p, the median projected increase is expected, from 9-12% (RCP2.6) to 35-40% (RCP8.5) by the end of the 21-st century. Hot (very high) temperatures, which were rarely observed at the end of the twentieth century, will become the daily weather by the end of the twenty-first century under the RCP8.5 scenario (Table 3.2-2).</p>

<p>Projections of Future Changes in Precipitation Extreme Indices: Table 3.2-3 displays distribution of projected CMIP5 14 GCMs ensemble changes in precipitation extreme indices presented for 2081–2100 years, relative to the 1986–2005 climatological baseline period. The Simple Daily Intensity Index (SDII) is projected to increase everywhere by the end of the twenty-first century under all three RCPs, with strong agreement among models.</p>
<p>The projections show that Central AEZ will experience the greatest increase of the maximum 1-day precipitation (RX1) from 4 (RCP2.6) to 8.5% (RCP8.5) relative to the reference period 1986-2005. By the end of the twenty-first century under RCP2.6, the projected RX1day increase will be from 2.3% in Northern to 4.8% in Southern AEZs and/or from 6.7% to 8.0%, respectively, under RCP8.5.</p>
<p>The Central AEZ will experience the greatest increase of the number of heavy precipitation days (R10mm), with R10mm increasing from 3 (RCP2.6) to 10.9% (RCP4.5) relative to the reference period 1986-2005. By the end of the twenty-first century under RCP2.6, the projected R10mm increase will be from 4.1% in Northern to 9.6% in Southern AEZs and/or by 9-10%, respectively under RCP4.5. By the end of the twenty-first century under RCP2.6, the projected number of very heavy precipitation days (R20mm) increase will be from 3% in Northern to 6% in Southern AEZs and/or by 11-12.5%, respectively under RCP8.5, and the medium increase - by 8-9 % according to RCP4.5 scenarios.</p>
<p>The total wet-day precipitation index (PRCPTOT) is projected to decrease everywhere by the end of the twentyfirst century under RCP8.5 and to increase according to RCP4.5 and RCP2.6 scenarios. The largest decrease in PRCPTOT is projected in Southern AEZ, with the decrease of PRCPTOT by 9.6%, relative to the reference period 1986-2005. By the end of the twenty-first century, the projected PRCPTOT increase under RCP2.6 will be from 2.6% in Northern to 6.6% in Southern AEZs and/or from 3.6% to 5.2%, respectively under RCP4.5.</p>
<p>The projections show that Northern AEZ will experience the greatest increase of very wet days (95pTOT), with 95pTOT, by 20%, under the RCP8.5 scenario, whereas Southern AEZ will experience the greatest increase of 95pTOT, by 19%, under RCP2.6, relative to the reference period 1986-2005. By the end of the twenty-first century under RCP2.6, the projected ensemble median increase of extremely wet days (99pTOT) will be from 8% in Northern to 19% in Southern AEZs and/or from 14% in Southern to 20% in Northern AEZs, under RCP8.5 9, with the medium increase by 17-18% according to RCP4.5.</p>
<p>The Consecutive Dry Days index (CDD) is projected to increase everywhere by the end of the twenty-first century under all three RCP scenarios, except Southern AEZ, where a slight decrease in consecutive dry days is possible under RCP2.6. The projections indicate that Northern AEZ will experience the greatest increase of CDD, with a CDD increase by 17% (RCP8.5), whereas Southern AEZ will experience the decrease of CDD by 1.6% (RCP2.6), relative to the reference period 1986-2005. By the end of the twenty-first century, the projected CDD increase will be from 3.1% in Northern to 7.8% (RCP4.5) in Southern AEZs and/or from 12.5% in Southern to 17% (RCP8.5) in Northern AEZs.</p>
<p>The Consecutive Wet Days index (CWD) is projected to decrease everywhere by the end of the twenty-first century under all three RCPs, except Southern AEZ where a slight increase in consecutive wet days is possible under RCP4.5 and RCP2.6. The projections indicate that Northern AEZ will experience the greatest decrease in CWD, by 21% (RCP8.5), whereas Southern AEZ will experience a slight increase of CWD, by +2.1% (RCP4.5) and/or +3.7% (RCP2.6), relative to the reference period 1986-2005.

<p>Projections of Future Changes in Humidity and Drought Conditions by Selianinov Hydro-Thermal Coefficient (HTC): An assessment of the hydrothermal coefficient (HTC) was performed to identify the humidity climate change patterns during the vegetation period. When the value of HTC is 1.0, it means that the amount of precipitations is equal to the amount of the evaporated moisture. HTC is frequently also used for monitoring drought conditions during the growing period. In the RM, the baseline 1986-2005 climatic conditions HTC have ranged from 1.4 in the North to 0.8-0.9 in the South-East of the country, i.e. it registers values characteristic of the moderately dry climate in the former case and of the dry climate in the latter case.</p>
<p>The assessment of HTC has shown that the insufficiency of moisture would become more pronounced in the future as compared to the climate of the reference period, and it clearly demonstrates the gradual aridization in the future of the RM territory, including the Northern AEZ, which currently is still sufficiently wet, Figure 3.2-3.</p>
<p>Analysis of data shows that by the 2081-2100 timespan, the drought conditions of HTC ≤ 0.7 will be observed on the whole territory of the Republic of Moldova, including the Northern AEZ (in August). Furthermore, under RCP8.5 in the Central (July, August) and Southern AEZs in July, August, and September drought conditions can even reach values characteristic of the medium drought (HTC = 0.6) and strong drought (HTC ≤ 0.5).</p>

<h3 id="climate-change-impacts-risks-and-vulnerabilities">CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS, RISKS AND VULNERABILITIES </h3>
<p>According to the National Communications<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> the Republic of Moldova is more likely to be affected by three types of climate impacts: temperature increases; changes in precipitation regimes and increased climate aridity, which are associated with the frequency and intensity amplification of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves and frost, floods, storms with heavy rains and hail, severe droughts. These conclusions are drawn based on the projected climate change scenarios, accompanied by a number of impact, risk and vulnerability assessments undertaken within the National Communications, along with other various assessments carried out at project level, covering national, sub-national and geographic magnitude . This work defines the basis for establishing mid- and long-term priorities of adaptation planning, action and investments, along with the monitoring of the effectiveness of planned and implemented adaptation. Table 3.2-4 refers to the undertaken assessments’ methods, approaches and outputs that revealed national and sub-national level climate risks and vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>The analysis of the national climatic data disclose that the drought frequency in the Republic of Moldova over a period of 10 years is about 1-2 droughts in the northern part of the country; 2-3 droughts in the central part and 5-6 droughts in the south. Between 1990 and 2015, 12 years (1990, 1992, 1994, 1996, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2007, 2011, 2012, 2015) with droughts of varying intensity were recorded on the territory of the RM<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>. In 1990, 1992 and 2003, droughts continued throughout the growing season (April to September). The most severe and disastrous droughts during the recorded period were in 2007 and 2012, affecting more than 70% of the country's territory.</p>

<p>Floods also affect the Republic of Moldova repeatedly. Over the past 70 years, 10 major floods of the Dniester River and the Prut River have been reported, three of which occurred in the 21st century (in 2006, 2008 and 2010). The floods caused by smaller rivers in the country are quite common as well.</p>
<p>The socio-economic costs of climate change associated with natural disasters such as droughts and floods are significant. During the period 1984-2006, they amounted to about 61 million US dollars. The 2007 and 2012 droughts caused an estimated economic loss of about US$1.0 billion and US$0.4 billion, respectively.</p>
<p>The climate change negative impacts present challenges for country’s economic growth, directly and indirectly affecting the sectors which are based on natural resources (agriculture, water and forestry) but also industrial sectors, such as energy, transport, along with the impact on population’s health. The exacerbating impacts of climate change may have repercussions on social and gender equalities. A summary of climate impacts and vulnerabilities of the key sectors of Moldova is presented in Table 3.2-5.</p>

<h2 id="national-and-sectorial-climate-change-adaptation-priorities">NATIONAL AND SECTORIAL CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION PRIORITIES </h2>
<p>The Republic of Moldova has an evolving climate change adaptation policy framework, with many complementarities and links to the cross-cutting sustainable development policy framework. Therefore, the adaptation priorities stated in the current NDC derive from both the national climate change policies and related development national and sub-national policies and plans. Some policies of the Republic of Moldova have their official validation until 2020, while a few policies cover the timespan until 2030, therefore, the draft policy documents, laws and regulations that passed various stages of public consultation and Government approval have been taken into account when identifying cross-sectorial and sectorial adaptation priorities.</p>
<p>The <em>National Development Strategy "Moldova 2030"</em> (2018), being the main reference document for the sectoral strategies and the subsequent policy interventions, aims to assume a greater responsibility to stop the degradation of the environment and the uncontrolled consumption of natural resources, taking into account the needs of future generations, as well as commitments undertaken under 2030 Agenda. The policy document <em>"Moldova 2030"</em> declares the principles of the green economy, which will ensure economic resilience and adaptation to the impact of global climate change and will contribute to enhancing its competitiveness at the regional and international levels, and, in the long term, will avoid the huge economic costs due to environmental degradation and climate impact. In the Strategy, people's interests are placed at the center of the development process, which could be accounted for in a sustainable way only by empowering people to participate, to contribute and to benefit from economic, cultural, social and political development based on a common attitude in which all human rights and freedoms are observed.</p>
<p>Climate actions are fundamental to the achievement of all 17 Sustainable Development Goals. The draft Strategy “Moldova 2030” sets out clear priorities for combating climate change by creating an efficient energy policy, along with a forward-looking climate change policy leading to a fair transition to a climate-neutral and competitive economy that will create opportunities for new jobs and sustainable growth at the same time. The National Coordination Council for Sustainable Development was created to set up a participatory and transparent process in the adoption and implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
<p><em>The Association Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Moldova</em><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> is an important treaty that commits Moldova to economic, judicial and financial reforms to converge its policies and legislation to those of the European Union. The chapter on climate change focuses on actions in six areas: (i) mitigation; (ii) adaptation; (iii) carbon emission trading; (iv) research, development, implementation and other related issues; (v) integrating climate aspects into sectorial policies and (vi) awareness-raising, education and training. The Association Agreement is accompanied by an implementation <em>Program of Action for European Integration:</em></p>
<p><em>Freedom, Democracy, Welfare</em><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>, which addresses adaptation to climate change and sets the framework for the congruence of Moldovan policies with European ones.</p>
<p><em>Promoting the “green’’ economy program in the Republic of Moldova for the years 2018-2020 and the Action Plan</em><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> for its implementation ensures the development of the necessary capacities of all those involved in the planned activities in order to achieve the following specific targets by 2020: 17% of gross final energy consumption from renewable sources and improvement of energy efficiency by 8.2%; promoting organic farming by implementing green economy principles and expanding the area of agricultural land used for organic farming by about 20%; reducing air pollution by 30% by developing sustainable transport, etc.</p>
<p><em>The Biological Diversity Strategy for the years 2015-2020</em><sup>16</sup> addresses the causes of biodiversity loss through the incorporation of requirements such as halting the biodiversity loss process starting with the government and ending with the entire society.</p>
<p><em>The Environmental Strategy for 2014-2023 and the Action Plan for its implementation</em><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> ensures the consistency of the long-term strategic planning with the EU rules and has a context for the development and approval of climate change adaptation strategies. Building up of an efficient system of environmental management contributing to increased quality of environmental factors and to observing the right of the population to a clean, healthy and sustainable natural environment is the main objective of the Strategy.</p>
<p><em>The National Strategy on Ensuring Equality between women and men (2017-2021) in the Republic of Moldova and the Action Plan for its implementation</em> <sup>18</sup> aims at greater reduction of gender gaps due to the social, economic and environmental vulnerabilities exacerbated by climate change. The strategy includes the area of intervention 2.6. “Climate change”, stating as Specific Objective 1.10: Adjustment of sectorial adaptation strategies to climate change by including gender equality<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>. The gender policy is supported by the <em>Law No. 5XVI of 09.02.2006 on ensuring equal opportunities between women and men</em>, which stipulates that in the Republic of Moldova, women and men enjoy equal rights and freedoms and are guaranteed equal opportunities for their exercise.</p>
<p>The draft Government Decision on approval of the <em>National Program for the Greening of SMEs</em> has been developed to support the SMEs in overcoming the needs and problems faced by SMEs in their path towards greening. The document sets out governmental priority support to SMEs for adopting green and ecological operational standards.</p>
<p>The Government Decision No. 590 of 21.06.2018 on approval of the <em>Concept of the reform of the national system of management, prevention and reduction of the consequences of floods</em> addresses the problem of flood prevention, transition from the defensive forms of action to those of risk management. The<em>.</em> Concept promotes a flood risk management system by establishing components for the management, prevention and reduction of the consequences of the flood risks.</p>
<p>Government Decision No.779 of 04.10.2013<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> on approval of the <em>Regulation on drought management planning</em> has the objectives: a) elaboration of individual drought management plans for each district of the river basin or sub-basin; b) specify the indicators that allow to identify the circumstances of drought; c) establish specific monitoring systems to identify drought circumstances; d) identify management objectives and measures to mitigate the effects of drought, including measures to rationalize water demand, to prioritize water use, to support basic human needs, including in food, to protect ecosystems water.</p>
<h3 id="cross-sectorial-climate-change-adaptation-priorities">CROSS-SECTORIAL CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION PRIORITIES </h3>
<p>Being a complex process, adaptation to climate change requires cross-sectorial perspectives coming from the involvement of a multi-level governance system with strong capacities for both planning and implementing adaptation. In the undertaken sectorial and institutional level capacity assessments of Moldova, it was concluded on several occasions that the need exists to strengthen the country’s capacities to plan and implement cross-sectorial adaptation.</p>
<p>Along with the above-described considerations of the national policy framework in identifying adaptation priorities, the outcomes of other country-driven prioritization activities at sectorial and cross-sectorial levels have been incorporated into the current Republic of Moldova’s NDC. Attention was paid to the outcomes of the activities financially supported by the leading climate donors with aid provided to national stakeholders for identifying adaptation capacity building or investment priorities under the selected and validated criteria and according to the specific timespans.</p>
<p>The prioritization of adaptation options has been carried out for various purposes: identification of key sectors for climate change adaptation considerations under the Climate Change Adaptation Strategy of the Republic of Moldova; identification of sector-specific adaptation measures during the development of sectorial strategic documents or their mainstreaming into development policies; identification of adaptation technologies during the development of technology action plans (TNA); prioritization of adaptation measures to be incorporated into socio-economic development strategies at the district level, identification of climate investment priorities, etc. A number of climate-related assessments have been undertaken prior to the prioritization process: vulnerability and risks assessments; development of vulnerability indexes; sector and institution capacity assessments; gender assessments in relation to climate change; institutional capacity surveys, Cost-Benefit Analysis, Cost-Effectiveness Analysis, feasibility studies, and other types of assessments and evaluation work that contributed to an informed decision during the prioritization process. Substantive knowledge on impacts, risks and vulnerabilities and initial assessments of adaptation priorities in Moldova results from the work conducted as part of the First (2000), Second (2010), Third (2014) and Fourth (2018) National Communications to the UNFCCC.</p>
<p>In most of the cases, the prioritization process was carried out using the MCA (multi-criteria analysis) methodology<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>, based on climate, monetary, social and environmental criteria, with alternative options examined and sensitivity analysis applied. Cross-sectorial and sectorial adaptation priorities have been validated by stakeholders within an adaptation consultation process, involving climate and sector experts, line ministry planners, researchers, the private sector, LPAs, NGOs, other relevant stakeholders with knowledge and experience in various areas, also considering lessons learned from previous planning processes, that allows for identification of feasible and efficient adaptation measures in Moldova’s specific context.</p>
<p>The Table 3.3-1 provides information on the categories of cross-sectoral adaptation priorities, along with the main actions and activities to be implemented in support to prioritized options that aim at country’s preparedness for and the absorption of climate impacts, building resilience at national and sub-national levels.

<h3 id="mid-term-adaptation-priorities-of-the-second-cycle-of-the-republic-of-moldovas-national-adaptation-planning-process">MID-TERM ADAPTATION PRIORITIES OF THE SECOND CYCLE OF THE REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA’S NATIONAL ADAPTATION PLANNING PROCESS </h3>
<p>The above-mentioned CCA priorities tend to be flexible and anticipatory actions to absorb climate impacts or enable quick recovery. From the implementation viewpoint, some actions respond to the immediate and nearterm country adaptation needs, therefore, they are formulated as the next iteration of the National Adaptation Planning process of Moldova (2020-2024). The second iteration of the NAP cycle in the Republic of Moldova will be implemented within two parallel implementation tracks: NAP-2 and Ag. SAP, and their outcomes and sub-outcomes will also contribute to further advance in adaptation planning through addressing mid- and long-term inter-sectorial and sector-specific adaptation issues. Other cross-cutting and sector-specific priorities mentioned in Table 3.3-1, addressing long-term decisions (not part of the NAP2) will have the implementation time horizon aligned to that of the mitigation component.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the second iteration of the NAP cycle will be implemented within two parallel implementation tracks:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The first track - National Adaptation Plan (NAP-2) with the objective to reduce climate change-related risks throughout the country by strengthening institutional and technical capacities that support integrated CCA planning and programming of forestry, health, water, energy, and transport sectors. It expands and deepens the national approach developed under the first cycle of NAP and strengthens synergies both vertically, at different levels of the governance, and horizontally, between the sectors affected by climate change to reduce duplication of efforts, pool resources for their effective use, and ensure a coherent and comprehensive approach to the integration of CCA responses into the development planning at national and sub-national levels.</p></li>
<li><p>The second track - Agriculture Sectorial Adaptation Plan (Ag.SAP) with the objective to mainstream climate change adaptation into planning processes of the agriculture sector, while improving food security for Moldova’s population and ensuring a gender-sensitive approach and the participation of all vulnerable groups.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The second cycle of National Adaptation Planning process is conceptualized as GCF Readiness Project and builds on the Republic of Moldova’s NDC1 commitments and on the outcomes on the first cycle of National Adaptation Planning process (2013-2017). The activities will address the main barriers to the integration of CCA considerations into national, sectorial and local government planning and budgeting processes, as identified during stakeholders’ consultations within the NAP-1 and preparation of the NAP-2.</p>
<p>The anticipated key benefits from the implementation of the second iteration of NAP include the articulation of a coherent approach to comprehensive risk management and adaptation planning; improved integration between planned and autonomous adaptation; targeted orientation of technical and financial resources to the most vulnerable areas and communities; bridging the gaps between vulnerability and risk assessments, planning and implementation; and concurrence for internal and donor-supported development resourcing, monitoring and assistance.</p>
<p>The first track of NAP-2 consists of 31 activities grouped under sub-outcomes and three outcomes as follows:</p>
<p><em>Outcome 1: National steering mechanism for long-term CCA planning strengthened</em></p>

<h3 id="sector-specific-climate-change-adaptation-priorities">SECTOR-SPECIFIC CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION PRIORITIES </h3>
<p>To address serious economic and social impacts of current and future climate change, Moldova has to promote efficient adaptation measures at sector level in climate priority economy sectors: Agriculture, Forestry, Water, Health, Energy, and Transport. While the needs for addressing climate change are still assessed within various activities, it is obvious that implementation efforts will certainly be of significant proportions and will require the mobilization of innovative solutions, financial resources, institutional capacity and political will for effective action.</p>
<p>In identifying adaptation priorities at national and sector levels, relevant sectoral climate change and development policies have been considered, as adaptation is closely interlinked with the country’s development policy and regulatory framework.</p>
<p>One of the strategic goals pursued by the <em>National Development Strategy “Moldova 2030"</em> <a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> that directly influences the quality of life of Moldova’s people is to increase people's access to safe sources of water, energy, sewage systems, road infrastructure and information technology infrastructure. The achievement of this overarching goal is dependent, to a great extent, on the measures to be implemented in key sectors of Moldova’s economy that have to contribute to sectoral and overall country climate resilience and adaptation to climate change. These activities will contribute to achieving the following Sustainable Development Goals (SDG): 1.5, 9.1, 9.4, 11.2, 13.1, 13.2, 13.3, 15.2, 15.3, 15.5 and 15.9).</p>
<p>Energy Sector. Improving energy efficiency, increasing the use of renewable energy sources and promoting sustainable development of the energy areas are among the priority objectives of the <em>Energy Strategy of the Republic of Moldova until 2030,</em> (approved by GD no. 102 of 05.02.2013)<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> with two chronological stages of implementation: 2013-2020 and 2021-2030.</p>
<p>A significant impact on the modernization and promotion of the national economy’s sustainable development will have the priority measures provided by the <em>Law on Energy Efficiency No. 139/2018</em>, which encourages the exploitation of the energy efficiency potential in the industrial sector at the national level</p>
<p>The <em>Law on Promoting the Use of Energy from Renewable Sources</em> (No. 10 of 26.02.2016) and the draft <em>National Action Plan in the field of Energy Efficiency for the years 2019-2021</em><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> <em>(2019),</em> is the legal base for promoting the use of energy from renewable sources, diversification of primary energy resources, and ensuring the safety, occupational safety and health in the process of producing energy from renewable sources.</p>
<p>Improving the energy performance of buildings is a priority of public policies in the Republic of Moldova, and the draft Government Decision (No. 1103 of 14.11.2018) <em>for the approval of the Regulation regarding the periodic inspection of the air conditioning systems in buildings</em><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> This government decision was developed in support to the implemented Law no. 128 of July 11, 2014, on the energy performance of buildings.</p>
<p>Transport Sector. The new (2019) <em>Railway Transport Code</em> <a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> sets out concrete rules regarding the state's contribution for the development of the railway infrastructure that will allow the creation of an investment climate in the branch and the development of competitiveness on the international market for freight services.</p>
<p>Agriculture Sector. The <em>Land Code</em> <a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> (draft) focuses on the principles of soil fertility conservation and enhancement, carried out through works to prevent and combat soil degradation and pollution processes, caused by natural phenomena or by economic and social activities. The draft Land Code comprises a chapter dedicated to soil protection and land management, which regulates obligatory soil protection and improvement measures, land planning measures, agro-ameliorative measures, hydro-ameliorative measures, soil conservation, soil quality monitoring and others.</p>
<p>The development priority of the agricultural sector for reducing soil degradation and increasing its fertility, using environmentally friendly agricultural practices and modern agricultural technologies, is stipulated in the <em>National Strategy for Agricultural and Rural Development</em> for the years 2014-2020 (GD No. 409 of 4 June 2014)<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The <em>Law on subsidized insurance in agriculture</em> (draft)<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> proposes a new subsidy concept adapted to the realities and requirements of the current market, to be compared to the mechanism established by Law No. 243/2004 regarding the subsidized insurance of production risks in agriculture. The new law proposes to increase the state's share in insurance, as well as to expand the list of objects and risks subject to subsidized insurance, thus preventing significant economic loss caused by the negative impact of climate change.</p>
<p>Government Decision no. 691 of 11.07.2018 on approval of the <em>Regulation on the conditions and procedures for organizing and carrying out the activities for land improvements, protection, conservation and increase of soil fertility</em>, was produced to support the implementation of <em>the Program for conservation and enhancing soil fertility for the years 2017-2020 (</em>GD No.554 / 2017)<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The <em>National Integrated Plant Protection Program</em> <em>for the years 2018-2027 and the Action Plan</em> for its implementation (GD No. 123 of 02.02.2018)<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> provides for actions for the development of sustainable agriculture and thus, to provide consumers with quality and safe vegetable products, as well as to ensure a healthy living environment.</p>
<p>The <em>National Strategy for Agricultural and Rural Development</em> 2014-2020 (GD No. 409/2014) states the priorities for agriculture and rural development: increasing the competitiveness of the agri-food sector by modernizing and integrating it into the market, ensuring the sustainable management of natural resources and improving livelihoods in rural areas. The Strategy is complemented by the Government Decision (of 9 June 2019) on the approval of the <em>Regulation on the granting of subsidies for improving livelihoods and work conditions in rural area</em><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> and provides for the improvement and development of rural public economic infrastructure, renovation and development of rural communities, diversification of rural economy through non-agricultural activities.</p>

The <em>Action Plan for the years 2018-2023 on the implementation of the Sustainable Development Strategy of the Forestry Sector</em><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a> in the Republic of Moldova refers to the specific objectives and actions addressing the adaptation of the forestry sector to climate change, which includes scientifically justified adaptation measures with clear mitigation co-benefits and sustainable development approaches, adequate maintenance and monitoring of forest condition, with intensification of afforestation/reforestation process through climate-resistant <em>spp.</em> The new version of the Forest Code aligned with European and international standards addresses the urgent problems of forestry sector of Moldova: promoting new practices for sustainable forest management to stop the reduction of woodland, stopping degradation of forest biodiversity by promoting nature-based types of forest with suitable biological diversity; decreasing fragmentation of land, stopping the unauthorized constructions and lease of woodland by ensuring the integrity of the forest fund; combating the illegal exploitation of forests and related trade by implementing the methods of monitoring of timber use and forest certification.</p>
<p>Water Resources Sector. The state's policy in the field of water resources is incorporated in the <em>Environmental Strategy for 2014-2023 (GD 301/2014)</em><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> which is mainly aimed at preventing the degradation of the quality of water resources in the context of the climate change, the protection and restoration of the wetland environment, providing to the population a sufficient supply of good quality water-based on a sustainable, balanced and equitable use of water. The provisions of the Strategy for water supply and sanitation for 20142028 (GD No. 199/2014) and the <em>National Program for the implementation of the Protocol on Water and Health in the Republic of Moldova for 2016–2025</em> (GD No. 1063 / 2016)<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> aims at improving livelihoods of the population and the access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation. The proposed plan will ensure the development of water and wastewater systems and will play an important role in achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. The draft <em>Law on the quality of drinking water was adopted by the Parliament in the second reading (Law no. 323/2018):</em> it complements the actions of National Plan on Water and Health and transposes EU Council Directive 98/83 of 3 November 1998 on the quality of water intended for human consumption.</p>
<p>The concept of the automated information system <em>"State Cadaster of Waters"</em> developed in accordance with the provisions of the <em>Water Law No. 272/2011</em> <sup>36</sup> represents the vision on the creation and functioning of the information space of the areas related to the protection, management and records of surface and underground water resources, hydrotechnical constructions and protected areas. The concept incorporates the main principles of data collection and monitoring, their reporting, the basic requirements regarding the functional content of the information. This document is to be adopted in order to operationalize its components.</p>
<p>Measures aimed at achieving climate and environmental objectives set for all water bodies and ecosystems are provided in the <em>Management Plan for the Dniester River Basin Area</em> (GD No. 814/2017) and for the <em>DanubePrut and the Black Sea watershed</em> (GD No. 955/2018)<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a> regarding the approval of the Danube-Prut Rivers and Black Sea basin management plan.</p>

<p>Human Health Sector. The issue of adapting the health sector and population to climate change is addressed in the <em>National Public Health Strategy for2014-2020</em>, (GD No 1032/2013)<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a>, which provides for the need for adopting a sectoral plan for adaptation and increased resilience including that of medical institutions, the need for providing guidance and training to healthcare staff in issues of climate change impacts on population, The draft Government Decision on the approval of the <em>Sectoral Strategy for Adapting the Health System to Climate Change</em> for 2018-2022<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a> states sectoral priorities for the reducing the vulnerability and risks to health by implementing measures to adapt the healthcare sector to climate change.</p>
<p>Spatial Planning. Through the draft Government Decision on approving the <em>Regulation on the framework content, the methodological principles for developing and updating, and approving the National Territory Planning Plan (NTPP)</em> the development of the basic set of documents on balanced and sustainable strategic planning of the territory at the country level and on spatial planning will be ensured, in accordance with the objectives of social, economic, cultural and ecological priorities of the country<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Along with the analysis of policy and regulatory documents, the current NDC incorporates sectorial adaptation priorities identified and discussed during the development of sector-specific adaptation planning documents of NAP-1, specifically, Sectorial Adaptation Plans (SAPs) for health and forestry sectors and other two partial SAPs for the transport and energy sectors. The SAPs were developed with the aim to facilitate the integration of CCA into relevant new and existing policies, strategies, programmes and activities through sectorial development planning processes. In the prioritization process, consideration was given to the current and future impacts of the climate change at sector and sub-sector levels, to the vulnerabilities of social groups, women, children, and the elderly people.</p>
<p>Mainstreaming CCA into sectorial planning for key climate adaptation sectors by adopting a SAP approach is a mid-term priority and it is to come into full operation within the second cycle of NAP. The above-mentioned dedicated GD on Climate Change Coordination Mechanism, NAPs and SAPs will mandate the formalization and operationalization of NAPs and SAPs.</p>
<p>Based on the priorities identified under the SAPs, along with the outcomes of other implemented activities revealing sectoral needs, like those of the Fourth National Communication of the Republic of Moldova to UNFCCC (2018), consultation process of NAP-2, a set of mid- and long-term adaptation priorities have been identified to be implemented on a sector basis and summarized in the Table 3.3-2.</p>

<h3 id="climate-change-adaptation-investment-priorities">CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION INVESTMENT PRIORITIES </h3>
<p>The prioritization of adaptation investment areas was carried out as part of the development of Republic of Moldova Country Programme for the engagement with GCF using Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA) methodology. The list of adaptation options for each of the key sectors: agriculture, water resources, human health, forestry, energy, and transport was produced based on the review of national and sectorial development planning documents, policies and documents related to climate adaptation and sustainable development, studies on climate impacts, risks and vulnerabilities, needs and opportunities for sector adaptation, and development partners reports. The consultation process on investment priorities was an extensive one, through the use of multiple stakeholders’ approach, employing national experts experience and perspectives, generating a shared understanding of investment priorities. The consultation allowed the negotiation within groups of participants, supporting a participatory decision-making process, and ensuring transparency of each step of the appraisal process. As in the other prioritization cases, the stakeholders involved in the process have different types of knowledge. The consultation events were used also as an occasion for stakeholders to share their experience, exchange knowledge in climate change planning and implementation and provide useful insights on how to improve country’s capacities to attract foreign investments and access donor funds.</p>
<p>The prioritization criteria for adaptation investment include the national interests and priorities and have been defined as: (i) alignment with the country's climate change adaptation strategies and plans as well as with the country's legislation; (ii) contribution to vulnerability reduction at the national level and increase in climateresilient sustainable development; (iii) total number of direct and indirect beneficiaries (women and men); (iv) contribution to transformational adaptation; (v) contribution to improved economic performance with high level of environmental, social, and gender co-benefits; (vi) financing needs of vulnerable groups, target population, sectors, development regions, country; (vii) financial and economic feasibility based on which sectorial investment options have been prioritized. Table 3.3-3 provides information on climate change adaptation priority investment areas.</p>

<h2 id="climate-change-adaptation-implementation-and-support-needs-and-provision-of-support">CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION IMPLEMENTATION AND SUPPORT NEEDS AND PROVISION OF SUPPORT </h2>
<h3 id="climate-change-adaptation-provision-of-support">CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION PROVISION OF SUPPORT </h3>
<p>In tackling climate change, Moldova has used its domestic resources together with international co-financing. While domestic sources supporting climate action come mostly from the public sector, the country faces a growing challenge in committing to large scale transformational adaptation action perceived as an additional element to sustainable development. Due to domestic budget constraints, the external support received by the Republic of Moldova to address climate change plays an important role in planning and implementing climate adaptation at the national and sub-national levels. Over the past few years, efforts have been made by the country to strengthen its capacity to implement large projects and to absorb external resources in accelerating the low carbon emission and climate-resilient course of development.</p>
<p>The overall Official Development Assistance (ODA) project portfolio addresses general climate change concerns, with some dedicated interventions to mitigation, while adaptation is mainstreamed within ongoing development co-operation activities that are at risk because of climate change, with several projects targeting dedicated adaptation planning and implementation. At the current stage of adaptation implementation in the country, both adaptation-dedicated and adaptation-relevant financing directions are important.</p>
<p>According to OECD statistics<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a>, gross Official Development Assistance (ODA) for the Republic of Moldova has reached $370.7 million in 2015, with the two largest donors being institutions of the European Union at $134.8 million, and the United States at $108.6 million. About 80% of climate-related development finance flow was committed through multilateral channels: European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the European Investment Bank, and the World Bank Group using mainly loans, while the remainder was committed by bilateral sources (e.g. the European Union, Germany and Japan), mainly in the form of grants.</p>
<p>The Government of the Republic of Moldova has developed the policy that ensure better coordination and synergy in the process of programming, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of external assistance, by establishing a broad consultation process and dialogue between the Government, private sector and civil society. External support is monitored through the <em>External Assistance Management Platform (AMP)</em><a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a> with the aim of increasing transparency in the use of external assistance, accountability in management and capitalization of financial resources that the Republic of Moldova benefits from, as well as to provide good information to society on how the resources are spent. Moldova uses also thematic Donor Coordinating Councils to harness mitigation and adaptation support and align it with NDCs priorities.</p>
<p>According to the data and reports presented on the public portal amp.gov.md, during 2014-2019, the development partners' commitments to support the implementation of adaptation in the Republic of Moldova amounted to about EUR 1,117.3 million; however, only EUR 356.5 million (32%) were disbursed as of 2019year end, of which 10% was allocated to the projects targeting adaptation, while 90% of the projects had adaptation co- benefits (Figure 2.4-1).</p>

<p><img src="img/MDA-NDC2-10.png"</p>
<p>Figure 3.4-1: Actual disbursements rate for adaptation targeted projects and projects with adaptation cobenefits from total commitments (A) and disbursements rate for adaptation targeted projects and projects with adaptation co-benefits from total actual disbursements (B) (Source: based on input data of AMP).</p>
<p>On the whole, during 2013-2018, the dynamic of disbursements from the development partners indicates a decrease from about EUR 139.8 million to about EUR 20.5 million, with some observed increase in 2019, including projects with targeted adaptation (Figure 3.4-2).</p>

<p><img src="img/MDA-NDC2-11.png"</p>
<p>Figure 3.4-2: The evolution of disbursements for targeted adaptation projects and projects with adaptation cobenefits (M EUR).</p>
<p>(Source: based on input data of AMP)</p>
<p>The Government of the Republic of Moldova accesses money from the international funds on preferential terms through various financial instruments: credit schemes, grants or subsidies. Interest rates on these preferential funding are low or not applied under the grants and subsidy conditions. The repayment period of loans is several times longer than the one applied to commercial loans, many of the loans also having grace periods. Thus, from the total received funds, 68% were disbursed as grants, 33% as preferential loans, and about 3% in the form of credits (Figure 3.4-3 A). Regarding the type of assistance, the data show an almost equal share between technical assistance and project support with a low percentage allocated to budget support (Figure 3.4-3 B).</p>
<p>In 2014-2019, the largest disbursements through the projects with adaptation co-benefits were made by the European Union, Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, World Bank, International Bank for</p>
<p>Reconstruction and Development (IBRD); Germany; Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD); European Investment Bank (EIB), EBRD (European Bank for Reconstruction and Development) other, totaling about 320.5 million euros.</p>
<p><img src="img/MDA-NDC2-12.png"</p>
<p>Figure 3.4-3: Rate of financing tools applied to targeted adaptation projects and projects with adaptation cobenefits (A) and types of assistance for targeted adaptation projects and projects with adaptation co-benefits (B).</p>
<p>Donors that had significant contribution to adaptation implementation include IFAD, Denmark and GEF through projects, such as "<em>Inclusive Rural Economic and Climate Resilience Programs (IRECR</em>)" funded by IFAD (approx. EUR 19.5 million grants and concessional loans); "<em>Disaster and Climate Risk Management in Moldova Project</em>" funded by the World Bank (concessional loan of US$10 million); EU-funding with several projects on disaster risk reduction, flood protection, forest fire clearance, sustainable management of pastures and forests, integrated water and land use management, protection of natural areas and biodiversity, and others. Adaptation cross-cutting areas referring to planning, coordination, mainstreaming, gender equality, monitoring and evaluation, EWS, communication, other areas have been extensively addressed through ADA/UNDP Project “<em>Supporting Moldova’s National Climate Change Adaptation Planning Process”</em> totaling</p>
<p>940,000 EUR. The European Investment Bank (EIB) disbursed about EUR 1.5 million in the framework of "<em>Management and Technical Assistance Support to Moldova Flood Protection Project"</em> in the framework of European Neighborhood Policy (ENP) (Figure 3.4-4).</p>
<p>In 2017 the Republic of Moldova signed a financing agreement with the Green Climate Fund on the implementation of the "Readiness and Preparatory Program for the engagement with GCF", under which the GCF offered US$ 300 thousand support to the Designated National Authority (DNA), the Ministry of Agriculture, Regional Development and the Environment for the implementation of activities within the project <em>"Support to Republic of Moldova in establishing and strengthening the DNA, development of strategic framework, and preparation of country program"</em>. The Readiness and preparatory support helps to establish and mandate the (DNA) to engage with GCF, build the knowledge and capacities of the MARDE team to efficiently manage operational processes, communicate with GCF board and secretariat, and access GCF resources under the investment projects.</p>

<p>Figure 3.4-4: Actual disbursements of donor countries and agencies for targeted adaptation projects and projects with adaptation co-benefits (M EUR). Other: Slovakia, GCF, Czech Republic, Poland.</p>
<p>(Source: based on input data of AMP).</p>
<p>The number and size of programs/projects targeting adaptation and those with adaptation co-benefits implemented in the key sectors of the Republic of Moldova during 2014-2019 were uneven, respectively, the volume of disbursements varied from one sector to another. The highest values of current disbursements came to the cross-sectoral action (31%), followed by the agricultural sector receiving 28% and water resources with 20% (Figure 3.4-5).</p>

<p>(Source: based on input data of AMP).</p>
<p>The received support helped the Republic of Moldova to engage in a number of sector-specific adaptation activities, spanning from planning to on-ground implementation of adaptation measures.</p>
<p>Agriculture sector received the largest share of adaptation-related aid and this is where adaptation is mostly implemented at the action level and this reflects the importance of this sector in the country’s economy. At the same time, it confirms the agriculture sector’s high exposure to climate change, including climate risks.</p>
<p>During 2014-2019, the total value of the development partners' commitments to finance adaptation projects and those with benefits for adaptation in the agriculture sector amounted to about 360.9 million EUR. Of this amount, only 99.4 million EUR have been disbursed, with 52.6% being disbursed in 2019 (Figure 3.4-6 A, B).</p>

EUR). Other: UN, FAO, Switzerland, Czech Republic, Poland (B).</p>
<p>It should be mentioned, that 49% (about EUR 25.7 million) of the disbursements during 2019 were made by the International Development Agency (IDA) as a concessional loan, within the multilateral project "Agriculture Competitiveness" (the total budget of the project being 36,257,764.15 euros). The objectives of the project are to increase the competitiveness of the agri-food sector by supporting the modernization of the food safety management system, facilitating farmers' access to the market and integrating agro-ecological and sustainable land management practices. The co-financers of the project are the Global Environment Fund (GEF) and the Kingdom of Sweden, which granted EUR 4 and 2 million, respectively.</p>
<p>A number of other development partners have provided targeted adaptation support or development support with adaptation co-benefits. Among other, during 2013-2019, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) supported the agricultural sector through a series of projects, such as “Review and preparation of a draft Land Code for the Republic of Moldova”; "Strengthening of the Food Safety System of the Republic of Moldova"; "Increasing small scale farmers' resilience to drought by adopting best irrigation practices and modern irrigation technologies"; "Support for adaptation and implementation of Integrated Pest Management in Moldova"; "Development of the National Strategy and Action Plan for animal genetic resources and dairy cattle genetic improvement program", and others.</p>
<p>During 2014-2019, the commitments for the implementation of the cross-sectoral adaptation projects and those with benefits for adaptation totaled about EUR 190.4 million, out of which only EUR 63.3 million were disbursed. The largest contribution of this period was made by the European Union, totaling EUR 61.85 million, of which, 48.96 million were disbursed as grants under the program "<em>ENPARD Moldova Program - Support to Agriculture and Rural Development</em>” which aims to provide budgetary support to the Government of the Republic of Moldova in the process of poverty eradication, promoting sustainable and inclusive growth and strengthening economic and democratic governance through policies and reforms in the field of agriculture and rural development; improving the delivery of services in the agricultural and rural sectors; sustainable management of natural resources, including water and biodiversity, etc. (Figure 3.4-7).</p>
<p>Other disbursements were made through the projects with adaptation co-benefits: "Modernization of Local</p>
<p>Public Services in the Republic of Moldova" and "Modernization of Local Public Services in the Republic of Moldova" (Phase II), supported by the European Commission (EC); German Development Cooperation (GIZ) and German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ); Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC); Swedish International Development Authority (AIDS) and the Government of Romania. The total amount of the commitments under these multilateral projects amounted to approximately EUR 87.1 million, of which about 38.9 million have been disbursed so far. It should be mentioned that the main donors were GIZ and BMZ with current disbursements of EUR 17.9 and 5.4 million for the first and second projects, respectively.</p>

<h3 id="climate-change-adaptation-implementation-and-support-needs">CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION IMPLEMENTATION AND SUPPORT NEEDS </h3>
<p>Meeting Moldova’s NDC adaptation goal requires successful and timely implementation of many adaptation projects, interventions, programs, with the involvement of strong institutions able to develop and implement effective adaptation policies and other components of the enabling environment. This includes the provision of leadership and coordination of adaptation action, monitor the progress of adaptation implementation and many other capacity-related activities. Table 3.4-1 provides information on the most pressing capacity needs until 2025, associated interventions, indicators to measure the success of the intervention, responsible agencies and estimated financial resources. This framework is responsive to the identified sectorial, institutional and individual capacity gaps mentioned in the sub-chapter 3.6.</p>

<p>Despite the difficulties to define concrete characteristics of future climate risks the country has to cope with, based on the already existing knowledge about them at national and sectorial levels, along with by now visible impacts of climate change on Moldova’s population, economy sectors, ecosystems (mentioned in the chapters above), it is obvious that a rapid economic, social and technological transformation is needed to pursue the sustainable path declared in the National Development Strategy Moldova 2030.</p>
<p>While the magnitude of the climate action needed to build resilience at national and sectorial levels is under the constant consideration and estimation, it is clear, that the Republic of Moldova will need considerable international support to cope with devastating effects of climate change and extreme weather events.</p>
<p>In 2016, in the Republic of Moldova, with the help provided by the World Bank, an economic analysis was carried out aimed at identifying medium- and long-term investment needs of key sectors of the country’s economy. The study applied a quantitative assessment of adaptation investment opportunities and returns across the target sectors, evaluating the cost of inaction in each sector, i.e., the expected annual opportunity cost of not being better adapted to prevailing climate conditions. According to these estimates<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a>, there must be a total adaptation investment of US$ 4.22 billion to mitigate the impact of climate change, with about US$ 1.85 billion being considered as a relatively high priority for the near future (Table 3.4-2). The priorities were identified based on estimated economic returns, the size of potential investments, and qualitative assessments of the impact on gender and poverty. The total cost of climate change adaptation inaction is estimated at about US$ 600 million, equivalent to 6.5 percent of the GDP, and it is expected that this value will exceed its double in real terms by 2050 and will amount to about US$ 1.3 billion, emphasizing the additional cost associated with delaying action to efficiently adapt to changes in the climate.</p>

<p>Note: * <em>- assessed by the World Bank (million US $).</em></p>
<p>Agriculture Sector: The biggest challenges and investment opportunities are in the agriculture sector. Rehabilitation/modernization of centralized irrigation systems and drainage infrastructure will make a major contribution to increasing current productivity and mitigating future climate impacts. These are expected to have good rates of return as long as they can be combined with successful institutional capacity-building for management of irrigation systems. Other options include small-scale on-farm irrigation systems, soil management and climate risk management technologies, in particular, conservation agriculture, and the potential for changes in crop mix towards perennial crops (i.e., grapes and fruit trees), which will be more resilient to climate change. The WB estimated the preliminary value of the average annual loss caused by extreme meteorological phenomena (drought, flood, hail, heavy rainfall, wind, frost, landslide) to US$ 34 million per year. The 2050 estimate of expected annual damage and loss is around US$ 335 million. The medium-term investment amount (by 2040) needed to address the current productivity gap in Moldovan agriculture and, at the same time, to increase the climate change resilience is US$ 2.409 billion.</p>
<p>Forest Sector: Ecological rehabilitation and expansion of forests and forest belts are expected to have high returns on suitable land, with high poverty and gender impact. Restoration of degraded forests and pasturelands also promote agricultural productivity through improved watershed function and protection from harsh weather. Future climate change will affect both the tree growth, causing changes in species distribution and ecosystems structure, and the frequency and magnitude of damage caused by diseases, droughts, and fires.</p>
<p>The current annual climate-related damage is estimated at US$ 414 thousand (of which: US$ 18,000 due to fires, US$ 177,000 due to pests and US$ 219,000 due to droughts). In addition, about US$ 300,000 are spent annually for pest treatment remedies. By 2050, it is expected that these costs related to afforestation works and forestry maintenance will increase to about US$ 120 million.</p>
<p>Human Health Sector: Although there is an uncertainty around the scale of climate-related health impacts, it is anticipated that the effects of several diseases could be exacerbated by climate change (e.g. physiological stress caused by low or extremely high temperatures, prevalence of disease-causing vectors influenced by climate conditions, the range of acute health risks and physical and mental well-being influenced by extreme weather phenomena, in particular heat waves etc. According to WB estimates (2016), the current cost of climate-dependent health risks (namely, heat-related mortality and food poisoning) is about US$ 20 million.</p>
<p>According to the <em>Climate Change Adaptation Strategy</em> (2014)<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a> and studies undertaken during the NAP-1, considerable investments are needed to provide healthcare in isolated communities to populations particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change (the elderly and disabled people); equipping emergency departments for cardiovascular diseases according to WHO requirements; modifying hospital infrastructure for operationalization to “green” standards, developing the national information system for collection and processing of data, including gender-disaggregated data on the effects of climate risks on public health, emergence and incidence of new diseases related to climate change; prevention, early warning, management and overcoming the impact of extreme weather events due to climate change (heat, cold, flood); eradicating malnutrition and ensuring access to safe, nutritious and sufficient food for particularly vulnerable population groups; protection of human health and consumers’ interests with regard to food safety; development of continuous air quality monitoring stations, etc.</p>
<p>Water Resources Sector: According to undertaken assessments, improvement in municipal supply systems to reduce loss, and building a storage reservoir on the lower Dniester River, present immediate, modest investment opportunities with high returns. In the coming decades, larger-scale storage infrastructure will be needed. The ideal size and timing of these require more analysis and the institutional capacity to effectively manage a variety of water investments would also need to be strengthened.</p>
<p>According to undertaken assessment, the provisions for water demand will increase considerably by 2040, which will be amplified by climate change impact. The unsatisfied demand, dominated by municipal and industrial consumption, is estimated at about US$ 95 million, and the total cost of climate change inaction in the water sector is estimated at about US$ 205 million per year. Investments in water supply infrastructure in rural areas could be an adaptation option for improving water supply in the agriculture sector and for the rural population as well. The cost-benefit analysis of small-scale water supply shows a benefit-cost ratio of 2.5 to 21.3 in the pan-European region, which includes Moldova (UNECE and WHO, 2011).</p>
<p>The EIB’s (2016) Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment (PFRA) identified 84 structural and 30 non-structural flood management measures. For these, a detailed investment plan has been prepared with a total investment of €325 million for structural measures and €120 million for non-structural measures, including maintenance.</p>
<p>Substantial economic benefits to reducing damage and loss will be provided through investments for structural and for non-structural flood prevention measures, worth € 325 million and € 120 million, respectively<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46" role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a>. These measures include: rehabilitation/construction of dams, dykes, small scale storage tanks, bank consolidation, wetlands, warning systems and their maintenance, informing/educating the population on flood risk and how to act in emergency situations. Other important investment opportunities for the water resources sector are: improving the quality of drinking water; improving sewage and domestic water treatment; increasing water recycling for industrial needs; protection of wastewater infrastructure against floods; water management by capturing surface water; land improvements to increase the probability of precipitation; technology implementation of groundwater layers recharge, etc.</p>
<p>Energy Sector. The Moldovan energy sector faces several challenges, the main one being the dependence on imports (especially natural gas). The investments needed to implement the scenario recommended by the ESMAP<sup>48</sup> study (connection to the Romanian transmission network for the diversification of the country’s external energy sources) are estimated in the range of US$ 421-441 million.</p>
<p>Renewable energy sources are most sensitive to extreme weather phenomena. The value of the current production of renewable energy related to the climate is estimated at only US$ 286 thousand annually (in the form of hydroelectric power), while the lost energy production is estimated to about US$ 150 million annually. The cost of wind technology may decrease over time, but now, wind power generation may be economically viable. The total investment potential is estimated at about US$ 235 million.</p>
<p>Lost heat production due to the current water supply deficit on Dniester River is estimated at US$ 4.6 million per year, based on the current import price and the assumption that energy production is affected proportionally by the water supply shortage.</p>
<p>The investments proposed in the measures of the <em>Energy Strategy of the Republic of Moldova</em> <em>until 2030</em>, Article 104, to promote energy efficiency related to the education and training of staff in the efficient use of energy, and the development of a series of educational programs to raise public awareness, organizing competitions and demonstrations of the achievements in this area will contribute to the viability of the entire energy sector against the risks of climate change.</p>
<p>Studies show that the total cost of renovating the private and public buildings in Moldova for heating and cooling efficiency could be hundreds of millions of US dollars per year over two decades<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47" role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Transport Sector: According to the WB Report (2016), the expected annual cost of climate change for infrastructure in Moldova by 2050 is around US$ 9-22 million, depending on climate scenario. It is expected that the investments in transport infrastructure will increase the resilience of the sector, provide essential gains for public security, as well as substantial economic revenues. The assessment undertaken in transport sector points to the need for enormous investments in the physical infrastructure, but also for associated measures, such as institution and policy change, capacity building and development of strategic documents for the Republic of Moldova to adapt and build resilience to climate change.</p>
<p>Taking into account the analysis carried out by the development partners, along with those based on national expertise, it may be concluded that the current opportunities for supporting low-carbon development and climate resilience measures in Moldova are visible, but the needs largely exceed the in-country availability of resources.</p>
<p>The Table 3.4-3 presents the aggregated summary of the imperative financing needs for 2020-2025 in the key sectors of Moldova’s economy based on the analysis of needs to implement actions and activities mentioned in the <em>Republic of Moldova Strategy for climate change adaptation</em>; Fourth National Communication of the Republic of Moldova; empirical estimates of the WB assessment, as well as cost-benefit analysis (CBA) carried out for prioritization of adaptation measures during the NAP1. The table incorporates also the outputs of adaptation investments’ prioritization based on CBA, CEA, other relevant criteria, carried out during the development of Republic of Moldova Country Program for the engagement with GCF, currently part of country’s project pipe-line to be submitted to GCF.</p>

<p>The first cycle of Moldova’s National Adaptation Plan (NAP-1) was established through a four-year (2013-2017) project “<em>Supporting Moldova’s National Climate Change Adaptation Planning Process</em>” supported by the Austrian Development Agency (ADA) with funding from the Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Environment and Water Management of the Republic of Austria and implemented by the Climate Change Office, Ministry of Environment of the Republic of Moldova, in partnership with UNDP Moldova.</p>
<p>The overall goal of the project was to ensure that the Republic of Moldova has a system and capacities in place for medium to long-term adaptation planning and budgeting with the overall aim to reduce the vulnerability of the population and key sectors to the impacts of climate change.</p>
<p>Through the implemented activities and produced outputs and outcomes in line with UNFCCC Guide (National Adaptation Plans. <em>Technical guidelines for the national adaptation plan process</em><a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a><em>)</em> the Moldova’s National Adaptation Plan was produced as a process that is dynamic, modifiable, and responsive to changing conditions of the country (political, economic, social) and latest information and knowledge on climate change impacts. Incorporation of adaptation into the Republic of Moldova’s planning required a number of important decisions, taking into account future risks and prioritizing early options.</p>
<p>The NAP process in the Republic of Moldova was established as a modality to assemble various adaptation efforts into coherent and sustainable national process. In its turn, the NAP was envisaged to assist the Government of Moldova to maximize synergies of existing or under development processes of NDCs, SDGs, Paris Agreement, CCAS and, to the extent possible, integrate and add value to a more sustainable and resilient development of the country. Participation of stakeholders able to support adaptation in the political context, with a special focus on sector level was, therefore, critical. In line with CCAS, the priority sectors of the first NAP were water resources, agriculture, forestry, health, energy, and transport –In addition, the regional development sector was considered as a priority because of its responsibility for local level authorities and planning. Collaboration with Ministries and their subordinated institutions has brought a broad range of useful sector expertise, improving the understating of the sectoral context in relation to CCA and ensuring country ownership.</p>
<p>Implementation of NAP1 was challenging due to lack of well-developed methodologies (nationally and internationally), constraints in resources, the volatile political context of the country affecting the progress and weakening the national ownership of the intended results. Despite these challenges, the project team was able to position the project as a catalyst for government planning on adaptation to climate change and has generated momentum to move up the issue of adaptation to climate change on the political priority agenda, as a distinct policy focus. Table 3.5-1 summarizes the main achievements under the NAP-1 in the Republic of Moldova.</p>

<p>Along with framing and implementing the first cycle of the National Adaptation Plan, the actions implemented at sector level presented a significant contribution to reducing the country’s vulnerability to climate change impacts. Recently implemented adaptation practices and actions at sector level are described bellow, with some emerging conclusions</p>
<p>The Agriculture Sector of the Republic of Moldova is working toward achieving sustainable agricultural development for food security under the climate change. In this regard, efforts have been geared towards sustainable land use and management practices, as changing climate adds to already existing resource problems of water scarcity, soil degradation, and pollution. Within the Rural Program for Inclusive EconomicClimatic Resilience, along with delivered dedicated training on techniques and practices of conservation agriculture, grants were offered to purchase agricultural equipment for no-till, mini-till technologies, in some cases combined with precision agriculture. Through the Fund for subsidizing agricultural producers, the Government annually allocates financial resources to motivate investments in both the consolidation of agricultural land plots and for the acquisition of agricultural equipment. Implementation of these technologies aims at continued vitality of Moldova’s agricultural economy while enhancing environmental benefits and building climate resilience. It seeks to promote the profitability of agricultural producers throughout the country while restoring or enhancing natural resources, with a special focus on soil conservation.</p>
<p>The International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD), through <em>Rural Resilience Project</em> (2017-2023) contributes to the improvement of smallholders and agribusiness adaptive capacity providing support to enhance climate-resilient irrigation and rainwater harvesting infrastructures; promoting investments for the application of conservation agriculture, irrigation technologies, integrated pest management, crops diversification and investments in post-harvesting and processing technologies.</p>
<p>Despite the progress made in the sector, a number of serious gaps still persist, in particular, related to methodological aspects of applying conservation agriculture technologies and practices, which are of particular importance for the success of this type of agriculture.</p>
<p>Promoting tolerant seed varieties with increased resistance to drought is a measure that complements conservation agriculture. The Catalogue of Plant Varieties registers new varieties of plants with higher resistance to drought conditions. Through the FAO support, the State Commission for variety testing benefited from advanced laboratory equipment to identify the best seeds in the process of varieties testing, that helps in approval of early varieties resistant to adverse climatic conditions.</p>
<p>The introduction of new policies, based on an integrated approach within the different climate change scenarios, as well as the adoption of action plans for managing river basins with sustainable water use, are some of the most important current and long-term adaptation priorities of the Water Resources sector to achieve the goal of country’s water security in support to sustainable development. The sector promoted the efficiency in the management of water resources through active involvement of created river basin committees and sub-committees, covering 80% of the country's territory, with the main objective to implement the two Water Management Plans for the Dniester River Basin and the Danube – Prut – Black Sea area. District-level committees provided guidance and supervision in implemented adaptation measures oriented toward consolidation of river banks within the river districts, clearing the rivers, arranging and rehabilitating springs and streams, removing waste and garbage.</p>
<p>The project "<em>Strengthening the institutional framework in the water supply and sanitation sector in the Republic of Moldova</em>" implemented a Small Grants Program for Environmental NGOs, addressing local, sub-basin level issues.</p>
<p>Flood risk and drought risk management plans are being developed based on the hydrographic districts, that will include priority actions related to the rehabilitation and development of the flood protection infrastructure, as well as adequate water resource management measures in the case of drought.</p>
<p>Being one of the main priorities of the sector, water security involves maintaining and capitalizing on water resources, providing water services and mitigating water risks to optimize the benefits for the economy, people and the environment. As part of the World Bank Project “<em>Diagnosis and prospects for water security in the Republic of Moldova”</em> the risks of water shortage were evaluated.</p>
<p>In addition to the activities oriented toward the development of sector-specific adaptation enabling environment during the NAP-1, the Human Health Sector implemented actions to strengthen the epidemiological surveillance of vector-borne diseases and health system capabilities to ensure the provision of medical assistance to the population during the heat waves. The data on air quality, surface water, groundwater and soil quality have been monitored and evaluated. In order to improve the capacity of the health sector to adapt to the climate change, a "<em>Guide for investigation and response to outbreaks caused by consumption of unsafe food and water</em>" was developed and widely distributed among health sector practitioners, along with guidance on the implementation of good practices for managing medical waste.</p>
<p>A number of awareness, education and prevention measures have been implemented to inform the general public about the danger of air pollution, the impact of increased air temperature in the context of global warming, in particular during heat waves, correct behavior of the population during the high heat. In this context, the Ethics Committee has undertaken an examination on the efficiency and correctitude of information disseminated to the general public on the impact of and behavior during the heat waves and other extreme weather events through media channels.</p>
<p>Although there are well-established public policies in the Republic of Moldova to promote human health, the country is not yet sufficiently prepared to deal with the range of problems associated with the consequences of climate change and more proactive action of health agencies, in particular of primary health care facilities, is to be adopted.</p>
<p>Similar to the health sector, the Forestry Sector of the Republic of Moldova strengthened its sector-specific adaptation enabling framework within the NAP-1. At the action level, afforestation measures were implemented with benefits for both adaptation and mitigation of climate change, and contributed to increasing the biological diversity. Special attention was paid to the planting of forest belts for the purpose of agricultural land and water protection. Measures were taken to create forest plantations for industrial and energy needs, as well as planting energy crops to meet population needs for heating and food preparation.</p>
<p>Extensive ecological reconstruction works were carried out in forestry areas, along with identification of the degraded land for further afforestation, along with the growth of forest reproductive material.</p>
<p>During the National Day for Greening of local communities, implemented with the aim to encourage the local population to take part in green activities, the Local Public Authorities have been provided with tree reproductive material in the amount of 1.0 million MDL, to be used for the creation of urban and rural green spaces.</p>
<p>Managing the interactions between climate change, land use, and terrestrial ecosystems is still a challenge at sector and national levels, and it requires efficient policy instruments that can help in ensuring conservation and sustainable use of forests, implementation of ecosystem-based adaptation strategies and ecosystem services programme.</p>
<p>For the Energy Sector of the country, promoting the use of energy from renewable sources operating on environmentally friendly technologies is a major priority of the sector. In this regard, the existing regulatory framework provides for the support of investors in electricity generation installations from wind, photovoltaic, biogas and solid biomass cogeneration plants by granting fixed tariffs and a fixed price. Currently, wind power plants with a cumulative power of over 27 MW are installed, complemented by the photovoltaic power plants with a cumulative power of 3.9 MW and biogas cogeneration power plants with a capacity of 5.7 MW.</p>
<p>The promotion of gradual transition from the use of traditional fuel sources to the use of biofuel evolves actively in the country, according to the statistical data (Energy Balance Edition 2018) in 2017, with over 26% of the total energy used in the Republic of Moldova -originating from biomass or, over 47% of the total energy used for heating and cooling is biomass.</p>
<p>According to the Report of the National Agency for Regulation in Energy for 2018, the loss of thermal energy in the networks decreased from 21.1% in 2017 to 19.5%. The main national producers of electric and thermal energy (Termoelectrica S.A. and CET – Nord S.A.) implemented projects to streamline the process of energy production and supply.</p>
<p>Regarding the power sector, it is worth mentioning that, during the last years (2015-2018) there is a positive evolution of reducing the electricity loss in the grid, thus, for 2018 it represents on average 8.12-8.87% of the total volume of electricity; at the same time, the National Agency for Energy Regulation approved for 2018 investments of over 870 million MDL for the improvement of the electricity sector.</p>
<p>Promotion of energy efficiency and renewable sources is seen as an urgent priority of energy sector, therefore, the annual <em>Moldova Eco Energetica</em> event is organized as an umbrella concept. The campaign finalizes with an award event of the best implemented projects, technologies and ideas in the area of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Sources.</p>
<p>In the Transport Sector, the technical projects for repair, reconstruction and construction of the national roads are designed according to the Practical Codes developed to meet the needs of the roads adapting to climate change. At the same time, the sustainability of the transport infrastructure is ensured by the use of materials resistant to temperature fluctuations and floods.</p>
<p>Recently, a number of regulatory acts were approved for classification and periodicity of the execution of the works of maintenance and repair of public roads, prevention and combating snow on public roads, limitation of the movement of the high tonnage vehicles on some roads.</p>
<p>The construction of better quality roads, resistant to climatic effects, would help to increase the competitiveness of the sector and the security on the roads. For this to be achieved, the transport sector of Moldova needs to catalyze public and private sector investments and enhance climate action for building a reliable transport infrastructure network.</p>

<h3 id="cross-cutting-and-sector-specific-barriers-challenges-and-gaps">CROSS-CUTTING AND SECTOR-SPECIFIC BARRIERS, CHALLENGES AND GAPS </h3>
<p>A number of capacity-related assessments undertaken at the national and sub-national levels, in particular at sector level, have identified gaps and constraints that cumulatively act as barriers that impede progress in adaptation planning and its implementation in the key sectors of the Republic of Moldova. More concretely, Institutional Capacity Assessment (ICA) carried out during NAP-1, application of Vulnerability and Resilience Indicators Model and Livelihood Vulnerability Index within NC3 (2010) to UNFCCC<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49" role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a> and climate change impact sectorial assessments within the NC4 to UNFCCC<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50" role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a>, the Climate Change Adaptation Strategy and its implementation Action Plan until 2020<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51" role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a>, the Technology Needs Assessment<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52" role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a>, the National Human Development Report in Moldova (2009-2010)<sup>55</sup>, World Bank Technical Assistance Document<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53" role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a>, the FAO comprehensive assessment of the impact of 2012 drought impact in the Republic of Moldova<sup>57</sup>; development of the Republic of Moldova’s Country Programme for the engagement with GCF, stocktaking exercise for the preparation of NAP, other project-based assessments undertaken by the national and external stakeholders have revealed the barriers to effective sectorial adaptation arising from political instability, socioeconomic conditions, uncertainties of future climate as well as financial, technologic, institutional, and individual knowledge limitations.</p>
<p>The main systemic impediments for an increased political commitment in addressing climate change adaptation include: (i) insufficient prioritization of climate change adaptation in national political agenda, with the focus of politicians on the immediate needs for economic growth; (ii) insufficient knowledge of high-level decision makers on the magnitude of the climate change impacts and the threat to economic growth and ecosystem services; (iii) insufficient statistical data and climate impact studies on health and wellbeing through a gender perspective.</p>
<p>The national actors, benefiting from the engagement and the participation in the climate change global agenda, have limited awareness and knowledge of trends and opportunities presented by the climate change global agenda, particularly regarding the opportunities for a range of information, tools, technical assistance, and project funding.</p>
<p>Legislation and policy papers have the following weaknesses: (i) climate impacts are addressed insufficiently in sectorial legislation and policies, even in highly climate-sensitive sectors such as agriculture, forestry and health; (ii) the lack of a specific reference to climate change in many laws hinders the development of sectorial adaptation programs, because ministries and agencies cannot request funding for adaptation-related activities without explicit powers in the area of adaptation to climate change; (iii) strategies do not take into account or do not include climate change adaptation considerations in proposed sectorial measures and objectives, even when these objectives are directly affected by climate variability and climate change.</p>
<p>The government has clear lines of communication and skills within individual institutions and agencies, while cross-sectorial coordination of information and strategies needs improvement. These impediments are a major constraint on the national government’s ability to link environmental and development strategies to the impact of climate change. Efforts are being made to move towards a more coordinated and integrated approach to climate change adaptation. The inter-sectorial Climate Change Coordination Mechanism led by the National Commission on Climate Change, including the M&amp;E component (under approval), combined with the National Adaptation Planning process, is expected to be a high-impact national strategic initiative specifically addressing climate change.</p>
<p>The number of climate-induced disasters in the Republic of Moldova is increasing<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54" role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a>; for this reason, additional efforts are required, first of all, to: (i) strengthen the forecasting capacities of severe weather conditions; (ii) increase disaster preparedness and emergency response; (iii) implement adaptation measures in agriculture and other highly-exposed sectors<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55" role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a>. This situation needs to be addressed in order to allow adequate response to dangers and other challenges of the evolving climate.</p>
<p>The constraints and impediments on institutional capacities faced by the Republic of Moldova presented in Tables 3.6-1 and 3.6-2 do not allow to respond effectively to the impacts of climate change; therefore, the <em>Capacity Development Program (CDP) up to 2025</em> was developed based on institutional capacity assessment of seven key sectors (water, agriculture, energy, health, transport, forestry and regional development) of the Republic of Moldova undertaken during the NAP-1.</p>
<p>It reflects the sectorial and cross-sectorial needs of the country and the priority capacity building actions to be pursued. When the Government’s decision on the Climate Change Coordination Mechanism and the M&amp;E framework is enacted, the National Commission for Climate Change will take over the surveillance of adaption activities.</p>

<h2 id="climate-change-adaptation-monitoring-and-evaluation-system-me">CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION MONITORING AND EVALUATION SYSTEM (M&amp;E) </h2>
<p>The Republic of Moldova, in its efforts to establish an integrated National Adaptation Planning (NAP) process at the national level and Sectoral Adaptation Planning process (SAP) at sector level, has aligned the functionality of Climate Change Adaptation Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) System to the planning cycle of NAPs and SAPs. The proposed Monitoring &amp; Evaluation framework is based on the need to monitor progress towards achieving the country’s climate-resilient economic growth. Using a sectoral planning approach aligned to NAP approach requires monitoring of sector-based activity as well as their aggregate impact on the overall country’s economy and further communication of adaptation efforts at sector and national levels.</p>
<p>The M&amp;E system for the Republic of Moldova’s adaptation component was designed to serve the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>create a set of overarching adaptation goals to which each sector will contribute,</p>
 </li>
<li>
<p>track and monitor individual sectoral objectives and indicators,</p>
 </li>
<li>
<p>allow for iterative planning and continuous, evidence-based adaptation planning,</p>
 </li>
<li>
<p>enforce the gradual integration of adaptation priorities in regular development planning,</p>
 </li>
<li>
<p>ensure transparency of the adaptation process and data collection,</p>
 </li>
<li>
<p>measure and monitor the outcomes and impacts of adaptation activities, investments, programmes on women and men’s resilience to climate change from a gender-responsive perspective.</p>
 </li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, the goal of the M&amp;E system is to ensure the measurability of progress across geographic scales, time and sectors, and to be able to determine whether, as a result of its successive plans, the Republic of Moldova is less vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.</p>
<p>Through the M&amp;E system, the National Commission on Climate Change will monitor:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>progress and evaluate impacts of implemented policies,</p>
 </li>
<li>
<p>implementation of adaptation related planning,</p>
 </li>
<li>
<p>development and dissemination of adaptation related knowledge and research, including guidance materials, methodology, tools and instruments,</p>
 </li>
<li>
<p>implementation of adaptation technologies and practices,</p>
 </li>
<li>
<p>adaptation related financing and investments, including the external support received, - adaptation related quality assurance process.</p>
 </li>
</ul>
<p>The proposed M&amp;E framework would allow for monitoring and planning along a 3-tier approach: (1) <em>micro-level monitoring</em> is targeted at assessing the adaptation result of individual actions (i.e. at the output level); (2) <em>meso-level monitoring</em> allows for tracking of adaptation achievements at the outcome level; (3) <em>macro-level monitoring</em> is conceived to evaluate or periodically assess the global, cumulative impact of all sectoral adaptation actions.</p>
<p>The reporting system adopts an <em>indicator-based reporting format</em> at different levels, consisting of indicators for tracking and evaluating the success of adaptation support and adaptation interventions.</p>
<p>The M&amp;E system, therefore, includes several types of system – based indicators:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p><em>driver indicators</em>: Indicators designed to measure the result of actions targeting the drivers of change;</p></li>
<li><p><em>output indicators:</em> Indicators designed to measure the result of adaptation actions included in SAPs;</p></li>
<li><p><em>outcome indicators:</em> Indicators designed to measure the result of SAPs in terms of reduced sectoral vulnerability and advance in adaptation/resilience;</p></li>
<li><p><em>objective indicators:</em> Indicators designed to measure the aggregate result of a NAP cycle, in terms of impacts on the vulnerability of the Republic of Moldova’s economy and progress in adaptation.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The developed indicator-based monitoring system is to be operated through the <em>Climate Change Adaptation Information System</em> consisting of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>a portal</em> intended for presenting the public information related to the sectors of the national economy:</p></li>
</ul>

<p>policy documents stipulating adaptation targets, reports on vulnerability &amp; adaptation assessments, publications, reports on evaluations, other materials.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>a monitoring platform</em> designed to create, monitor and evaluate indicators by domain, focus area, level of development, data provider, calculation methodologies/ formulas, spatial level, reference period, frequency of data collection, expected adaptation trend and other monitoring and evaluation options based on templates.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Given its crosscutting nature, the adaptation action requires mobilization of internal and external financial resources, as well as scaling up national investments in climate finance, from both public and private sources. Therefore, as part of the M&amp;E system, in the Republic of Moldova, a <em>Climate Budget Tagging</em> (CBT) process is under implementation, that aims at improving the understanding of how and how much is being spent on national climate change responses, through which programs funds are being spent, and which programs include climate change objectives (or co-benefits). This process supports the ability of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Agriculture, Regional Development and Environment to track climate expenditures and improves their ability to ensure progress on climate change as related to the Republic of Moldova’s national development goals and international commitments.</p>
<p>Under the CBT tracking system, it is proposed that the monitoring of sectoral work plans is based on output indicators at the activity level and outcome indicators at the programme level.</p>
<p>Four Climate Change Budget the following indicators (CCBIs)/climate markers have been established: (1) Policy development and governance; (2) Research and development; (3) Knowledge sharing and capacity building; (4) Climate response and service delivery.</p>
