<h1>SUMMARY OF THE FIRST NDC UPDATED (2020-2030)</h1>
<p><strong>REPUBLIC OF CUBA</strong></p>

<p>The present document is a summary of the updated version of the First Nationally Determined Contribution of Cuba, submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and is in accordance with the Articles 3 and 4 of the Paris Agreement, paragraphs 22 and 24 of the Decision 1 CP21.</p>
<h2 id="context-of-the-updated-version-of-the-first-nationally-determined-contribution-in-cuba">1. Context of the updated version of the First Nationally Determined Contribution in Cuba </h2>
<p>Cuba is highly committed to the global endeavors to combat climate change and its devastating effects. There is a proven political willingness in the Cuban government that is perceived in its ethical behavior, as well as in the permanent efforts towards the promotion and implementation of national actions to combat climate change and to honor international commitments. Cuba is also committed to the sharing of experiences and good practices with other nations as evidence of cooperation and solidarity advocated by the Cuban revolution.</p>
<p>In this context, the country has achieved important milestones, despite the prevalence of extreme challenges inherited from the condition of being a Small Island Developing State (SIDS) under a sturdy economic, commercial and financial blockade imposed by the United States of America, which has been intensified to record levels in the last few years by the Trump Administration – the latter being the main obstacle to the achievement of major progress when facing climate change and national development.</p>
<p>Following the adoption of the Paris Agreement, the Cuban Government reinforced its national efforts and has built an ambitious framework for actions and mitigation.</p>
<p>By stating its increased ambition in this update, Cuba reiterates its position that the content of the Nationally Determined Contribution is established by each country on a voluntary and non-prescriptive basis, and should be viewed in the broader context identified by Article 3 of the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>The mentioned contributions are to be assessed in the context of the Principle of Common but Differentiated Responsibilities of the Parties of the Convention, meaning the claim of financial resources, the transfer of technology and capacity building, in accordance with the obligations established in the UN Framework Convention and the Paris Agreement.</p>
<h2 id="national-circumstances-pertinent-to-this-contribution">2. National circumstances pertinent to this Contribution </h2>

<p>The new Constitution of the Republic of Cuba, approved by the people’s referendum in 2019, explicitly mentions climate change in the context of international relations.</p>

<p>The Bases of the Economic and Social National Development Plan up to the year 2030, is the main tool to achieve prosperous development, that is economically and socially sustainable, resilient, and less intensive in carbon emissions.</p>
<p>The Guidelines of the Economic and Social Policy of the State and the Revolution approved by the People’s Power National Assembly in July 2016, tackles as a priority, the issues related to climate change.</p>
<p>In April 2017, the Cuban Government adopted the State Plan to confront Climate Change, known as “Tarea Vida” (Life Task) as the main instrument to combat climate change.</p>
<h3 id="climate-profile-vulnerabilities-adaptation">2.1 Climate profile (vulnerabilities, adaptation) </h3>
<p>The Cuban archipelago is highly vulnerable to global climate change, given its status of being a small island state located in the tropical area of the planet. Climate change is becoming worse and will continue to worsen in the future, gradually turning into a determining factor for sustainable development. Several currents and projected impacts are characterized in this update NDC.</p>
<h3 id="intensification-of-the-economic-commercial-and-financial-blockade-and-strengthening-of-the-hostility-from-the-united-states-government-towards-cuba">2.2 Intensification of the economic, commercial and financial blockade and strengthening of the hostility from the United States government towards Cuba </h3>
<p>As mentioned, the economic, commercial and financial blockade imposed, for almost 6 decades, by the United States government on Cuba, is the main hurdle for development in the country, as it deleteriously impacts all spheres and sectors of Cuban life and society. Moreover, it has a negative impact on program policies and actions aimed at confronting climate change and its impact. The blockade, aggravated during President Donald Trump administration’s, is the fundamental barrier for Cuba to access international financial resources, supplies and technologies.</p>

<h1>FIRST NATIONAL DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION (UPDATED)</h1>
<p><strong>REPUBLIC OF CUBA</strong></p>
<p><strong>2020-2030</strong></p>

<h2 id="el-contexto-de-la-actualización-de-la-contribución-nacionalmente-determinada-de-cuba">1. The context of updating the Nationally Determined Contribution of Cuba</h2>

<p>Cuba is highly committed to global efforts to confront climate change and its devastating effects.</p>
<p>There is a proven political will on the part of the Cuban government, which is reflected in its ethical conduct, in its permanent efforts to promote and implement national actions to combat climate change and honor the country's international commitments; as well as the willingness to share their experiences and good practices with other nations as a sign of the solidarity cooperation that the Cuban Revolution advocates.</p>
<p>In this context, the country has obtained important results despite the prevalence of great challenges derived from its condition as a small island developing state subjected to a strict economic, commercial and financial blockade imposed by the Government of the United States of America, which has intensified. at levels unprecedented in recent years by the Administration of President Trump, and which constitutes the main obstacle to achieving greater progress in confronting climate change and for the country's development.</p>
<p>After the adoption of the Paris Agreement, the Cuban Government has continued to strengthen its national efforts and build an ambitious framework of adaptation and mitigation actions. On the occasion of the Summit on Climate Action, convened by the UN Secretary General in September 2019, Cuba presented some of its most significant results and the projections of its public policies to confront climate change, as part of the initiatives that contribute to the global efforts taking place today. On that occasion, information was provided on the national work in a broader and more ambitious action platform than that formulated in the proposal for a Nationally Determined Contribution of November 2015.</p>
<p>During the 25th Conference of the Parties, held in Madrid in December 2019, the Head of the Cuban Delegation declared the country's decision to update its Nationally Determined Contribution in 2020.</p>
<p>This document constitutes the update of Cuba's First Nationally Determined Contribution to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and is presented in accordance with Articles 3 and 4 of the Paris Agreement, and paragraphs 22 and 24 of the Decision 1 CP 21 of 2015.</p>
<p>By thus recording its increased ambition in this update, Cuba reiterates its position that the content of the Nationally Determined Contribution is established by each country on a voluntary and non-prescriptive basis, and should be seen in the broad context identified by Article 3 of the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>These Contributions must be examined in the context of the Common but Differentiated Responsibilities of the Parties to the Convention, which implies, among other elements, that being able to materialize the commitments expressed by developing countries, demand for financial resources, transfer of technology and capacity building, which developed countries must contribute incrementally, in accordance with their obligations established in the Framework Convention and the Paris Agreement.</p>


<h2 id="circunstancias-nacionales-relevantes-a-esta-contribución">2. National circumstances relevant to this Contribution</h2>

<h3>2.1 Climate change in the country's public policies</h3>


<p>The new Constitution of the Republic of Cuba, approved in 2019 by popular referendum, expressly refers to climate change in the context of international relations and in accordance with its Article 16, subsection f “promotes the protection and conservation of the environment and the confrontation climate change, which threatens the survival of the human species, based on the recognition of common but differentiated responsibilities; the establishment of a fair and equitable international economic order and the eradication of irrational patterns of production and consumption ”.</p>
<p>The Bases of the National Plan for Economic and Social Development until 2030 constitute the country's main tool to achieve its objectives of a prosperous, economically, socially and environmentally sustainable development that is resilient and less intense in carbon emissions.</p>
<p>The confrontation with climate change is identified as a priority in the Bases of the Plan. In particular, the "Strategic Axis: Natural Resources and the Environment" declares as one of its three general objectives: "Strengthen national capacities for adaptation to climate change" and endorses among its "Specific Objectives" six that refer to confronting climate change. climate change and are listed below.</p>

<p>The Guidelines for the Economic and Social Policy of the State and the Revolution, approved by the National Assembly of People's Power in July 2016, also address the issue of confronting climate change and indicate:</p>


<p><em>Guideline 107. Accelerate the implementation of science, technology and innovation directives and programs, aimed at tackling climate change, by all agencies and entities, integrating all of this into territorial and sectoral policies, with priority in the agricultural sectors , hydraulic and health. Raise the information and training that contributes to objectify the perception of risk at the scale of the entire society.</em></p>

<p><em>Guideline 237. The hydraulic program will continue to be developed with far-reaching investments to face the impact of climate change and materialize adaptation measures: the reuse of water; the capture of rain; the desalination of seawater and the sustainability of all associated services, which makes it possible to achieve and exceed the sustainable development objectives.</em></p>


<p>In April 2017, the Government adopted the State Plan for Confronting Climate Change, known in Cuban society as “Tarea Vida”. The Plan is structured in 5 Strategic Actions, and 11 Tasks.</p>
<p><img src="img/CUB-NDC1-1.png"></p>
<p>Actions 1, 3 and 5 deal with vulnerable coastal settlements and guide, successively, not to allow the construction of new houses in threatened coastal settlements that are predicted to disappear due to permanent flooding and the most vulnerable, and to reduce the population density in coastal lowlands (AE 1); develop constructive concepts in infrastructure, adapted to coastal flooding for low-lying areas (AE 2); and planning the processes of urban reorganization of threatened settlements and infrastructures, starting with lower-cost measures, such as induced natural solutions (recovery of beaches, reforestation). (AE 5).</p>
<p>The 11 Tasks of the Plan cover a wide range of actions. No. 1 complies with the indication to prioritize vulnerable areas, identified in Annex 1 of the State Plan. These are measures for the coastal protection of cities, relocation of human settlements, comprehensive recovery of beaches, mangroves and other protective natural ecosystems, hydraulic works and coastal engineering, among others.</p>
<p>The following Tasks deal with the legal framework (Task 2), beaches (Task 3), the availability and efficient use of water (Task 4), reforestation (Task 5), coral reefs (Task 6), management territorial and urban (Task 7), strengthening of monitoring, surveillance and early warning systems (Task 9), raising the perception of risk, increasing the level of knowledge and the degree of participation of the entire population (Task 10), and the search for international financing (Task 11). Of particular complexity is Task 8, which indicates the implementation and control of climate change adaptation and mitigation measures derived from sectoral policies in programs, plans and projects linked to 12 prioritized sectors.</p>
<p><img src="img/CUB-NDC1-2.png"></p>


<h3>2.2 Climate profile (vulnerabilities, adaptation)</h3>


<p>For Cuba, confronting climate change is a high priority. The Cuban archipelago is very vulnerable to global climate change, given its condition as a small island state located in the tropical region of the planet. Climate change has been aggravating and will aggravate in the future, the environmental problems facing the country <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> gradually becoming a determining factor of sustainable development.</p>
<p>The climate in Cuba today is warmer and more extreme. Since the middle of the last century the average annual temperature has increased by 0.9 degrees Celsius. The last decade of the last century and the first of the present have been the warmest according to historical measurements of temperature. The rise in sea level has been recorded in the last forty years according to measurements at various points in the Cuban archipelago. The availability of water decreases; The results show that at present it has decreased more than 20% compared to 1990.</p>

<p>A great variability has been observed in the cyclonic activity and at present a very active stage is manifested. The rainfall pattern is changing. In recent decades, rains in the dry period have increased and decreased in the wet months. The frequency and extent of droughts has increased significantly since 1960; with major damage in the eastern region.</p>
<p>A significant reduction in water potential is estimated at the national, regional and local levels. The impact of climate change on water resources will be one of the most important effects of climate change, due to the strategic nature of water for the development of the country, particularly agriculture. The investigations carried out show that the usable water resources could be 60% of those existing today, increasing the competition between the availability of water, the growing human demand and the need to maintain the balance of the ecosystems.</p>
<p>Average sea level rises. Future projections indicate increases that would imply a slow decrease in the country's surface area and the gradual salinization of the coastal underground aquifers, due to the increase in saline intrusion and the consequent advance of the “saline wedge”. For its part, the rise in sea level due to intense hurricanes and other extreme meteorological events will continue to represent a significant danger of climate change for the Cuban archipelago due to coastal flooding and the destruction of natural and human heritage near the coast.</p>
<p>In general, it can be ensured that the Cuban climate transitions from its condition of tropical humid to tropical dry, with average temperatures above 30 ° C, approximately 1000 mm of annual average rainfall and 70 days with rain, conditions that will promote displacement. from the dry landscapes of the eastern region to other areas of the country. It can be assured that the air temperature will continue to increase, consistent with the estimates made in previous modeling carried out in Cuba, and may reach 4.5 ° C. The greatest warming will occur mainly in the warmest period of the year, a sign that will become clearer as time progresses.</p>
<p>Precipitation will maintain the estimated downward trend. Days with rainfall will decrease; heavy rainfall and heavy rainfall will increase; and the drought processes will increase in intensity and duration. Solar radiation will increase, in correspondence with the decrease in cloud cover.</p>

<h3>2.3 Increase in the economic, commercial and financial blockade and the hostility policy of the United States government against Cuba.</h3>

<p>The economic, commercial and financial blockade imposed by the government of the United States of America against Cuba for almost 6 decades constitutes the main obstacle to the development of the country by negatively impacting all spheres and sectors of Cuban life and society, including on policies, programs and actions to confront climate change and its effects. The blockade represents the fundamental barrier for Cuba's access to international sources of financing, supplies and technologies.</p>
<p>In recent years, after the arrival at the White House of the Administration of President Donald Trump, there has been an unprecedented upsurge of the blockade and the policy of hostility towards Cuba. A demonstration of the above claim was the decision to activate Title III of the Helms-Burton Act. As a consequence, Cuba's economic activities have been strongly impacted, in particular those related to foreign trade operations and foreign investment, based on their dissuasive and intimidating effects, to which is added the fear that the other regulations and laws also generate. of the blockade.</p>
<p>The behavior of the current government of the United States constitutes an affront to the international community that for 28 consecutive years has condemned, almost unanimously, the blockade, including the Helms-Burton Act. It ignores successive resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly and the declarations of the Summits of Heads of State and / or Government of the European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean, the African Union, the Community of Latin American States and the Caribbean (CELAC); as well as the Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77 plus China; of different political parties, personalities, businessmen, inside and outside the United States.</p>
<p>The impact of this policy, especially the blockade, weighs on the entire climate agenda of Cuba, presenting serious limitations in national action and in the country's ability to achieve more ambitious goals <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> .</p>

<h3>3.2 Specific approaches to adaptation</h3>


<p>Adaptation is reaffirmed as the main priority of the country, due to the negative impact of climate change on its natural and human ecosystems and given the low level of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions in the country.</p>
<p>The adaptation actions reflected here, consistent with public policies, are presented to indicate Cuba's priorities according to its circumstances, and in no way indicate an international obligation of the country.</p>
<p>Cuba expressly identifies, in the Annual Plan of the Economy, resources destined for adaptation. These figures in the future will have the level that the country's financial possibilities allow. To respond to the growing impacts of climate change, much higher amounts will be required.</p>
<p>These and other areas associated with the economic and social development of the country, will require financial resources, technology and capacity building, coming from international cooperation, and compliance with the obligations of industrialized countries under the United Nations Framework Convention on the climate change and greater effectiveness and agility in the management of Multilateral Funds, in particular the Green Climate Fund.</p>

<h3> 3.3 Specific approaches to mitigation</h3>


<p>Regarding mitigation, Cuba's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is minimal. In 2016, the last year in which GHG emissions were estimated in Cuba, in the structure of total gross emissions they were recorded at 50,213.7 ktCO <sub>2eq</sub> . and the absorptions at 27,147.2 ktCO <sub>2eq</sub> ., resulting in 23,066.5 ktCO <sub>2eq</sub> . of net emissions. Of the total gross GHG emissions, 70.5% correspond to the Energy sector, which, added with those of the AFOLU sector, total 90.6% of the country's emissions.</p>
<p>Despite the low impact of emissions, and the priority and cost that adaptation means for the country, Cuba has systematically developed and financed mitigation actions associated with savings, the use of renewable energy sources, energy efficiency and reforestation, those that in some cases have played a prominent role in relation to international trends.</p>
<p>The National Plan for Economic and Social Development to 2030 (PNDES 2030), introduces for the first time in the public policies of the country, the concept of a less intense development in greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, mitigation is appreciated in national policies as an essential dimension of development, which contributes to modernization and technological development on the basis of sustainability, the strengthening of their capacities, the improvement of the effectiveness and efficiency of the processes by reducing the consumption of energy carriers of fossil origin, the use of more efficient technologies, a better waste management, among other important elements that cross the entire economic activity of the country.</p>

<h4>3.3.1 Mitigation contributions</h4>



<p>Taking into account the sector contribution to the national GHG inventory, the priority sectors for reducing emissions, at the current stage, are the energy sector and agriculture. In these sectors, the country's efforts are concentrated in the identification and implementation of mitigation measures. The measures identified will require, for their full implementation, financial support, technology transfer and capacity building. A summary of the mitigation contributions by sectors that make up the country's CND is shown in the following table.</p>

<h2 id="contribución-de-cuba-ante-la-cooperación-internacional">4. Contribution of Cuba to international cooperation</h2>

<p>Based on accumulated experience, the country has shared its results with other developing nations, especially the small island states. The routes have been diverse, from bilateral collaboration to actions with the support of developed countries and international organizations.</p>
<p>With international assistance, Cuba today has a Capacity Building Center for Disaster Risk Reduction and Adaptation to Climate Change, which has carried out multiple activities and harbors even greater potential, to continue promoting South - South and triangular cooperation.</p>
<p>Cuba considers that these are national actions that contribute to the effective implementation of the Convention, and reaffirms its willingness to continue cooperating in the development of capacities in the face of climate change, including, among others, areas such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>
Technical assistance in preparing national communications, biennial update reports, and greenhouse gas inventories.
</li>
<li>
Development of climate modeling and projections.
</li>
<li>
Carrying out and implementing Danger, Vulnerability and Risk Studies.
</li>
<li>
Assessments on coastal vulnerability and impacts of extreme events and climate change, as part of the environmental impact assessment of development works and projects.
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="salvaguardas">5. Safeguards</h2>

<p>Cuba - in correspondence with its national circumstances - will continue to show its commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, in the context of the application of the Principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, and the achievement of its goals for sustainable development, as provides for the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>The level of compliance and the prospects for greater ambition in the Cuban Contribution will depend on compliance with the international obligations established under the Convention.</p>
<p>In the exercise of its sovereign rights, Cuba reserves the right to adjust its Contribution:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In the event of serious damage due to an extreme natural phenomenon or other force majeure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When adequate support is not available in the form of financing, technology transfer and capacity building, in accordance with the commitments established for developed countries in the Convention and the Paris Agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a consequence of the negative impact of a tightening of the economic, commercial and financial blockade of the United States of America against Cuba.</p>
