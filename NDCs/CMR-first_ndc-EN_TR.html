<p>The Cameroon INDC is anchored in the vision that the country has drawn for its future by 2035: to become an emerging country. This objective is accompanied by a set of intermediate objectives: (i) poverty reduction; (ii) the attainment of the middle-income country stage, (iii) the attainment of the New Industrialized State stage, and (iv) the consolidation of the democratic process and national unity while respecting the diversity that characterizes the country. country. In economic terms, this will include sustained growth, and a doubling of the secondary sector in the GDP structure (from 19 to 38 per cent).</p>
<p>Cameroon is a weak emitter of GHGs (2nd National Communication). This ambitious development strategy will result in a strong increase in emissions.</p>
<p>Through this INDC, Cameroon intends to reduce the carbon footprint of its development without slowing its growth, by favoring mitigation options with high co-benefits <strong>(Section 2: Mitigation)</strong> ; strengthen the country's resilience to climate change <strong>(Section 3: Adaptation)</strong> ; bring coherence to its sectoral policies and strengthen its mechanism and implementation tools to facilitate the achievement of these objectives <strong>(Section 4)</strong> ; and mobilize for this purpose <strong>(section 5)</strong> .</p>

<h2 id="adaptation">3. Adaptation </h2>
<p>In June 2015, Cameroon validated a National Adaptation Plan for Climate Change (PNACC) that includes, among other things, an assessment of climate change in each of the five agro-ecological zones <a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> , an assessment of the sensitivity, of the vulnerability and sectoral and geographic resilience, a 2016-2025 intervention strategy, an assessment of losses, risks and gaps, a five-year action plan for 2016-2020 broken down into 20 detailed project files.</p>
<p>The PNACC's vision is that by <em>2035, "climate change in Cameroon's five agro-ecological zones is fully integrated with the country's sustainable development, thus reducing its vulnerability, and even turning the climate change problem into a solution / opportunity. of development. Thus Cameroonians - especially women, children and vulnerable people - and the country's economic sectors gain greater resilience and greater capacity to adapt to the negative impacts of climate change</em> . "</p>
<p>In order to achieve this result, the PNACC presented a strategic program based on <strong>4 axes:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Strategic Axis 1: Improve Knowledge on Climate Change </strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong> Support research; Refine climate scenarios, popularize climate information; Set up an observation, information and warning system; Constitute a database for indicator tracking and MRV.</p>
<p><strong>Strategic Axis 2: Inform, educate and mobilize the Cameroonian population to adapt to climate change </strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong> : Communities and vulnerable groups are the priority targets; Support advocacy actions; Lead community mobilizations; Promote IEC actions; Use local and traditional media; Share adaptation experiences.</p>
<p><strong>Strategic Axis 3: Reduce vulnerability to climate change in the country's main agro-ecological sectors and zones </strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong> Evaluate costs; Fund studies and concrete measures; Design financial incentive mechanisms.</p>
<p><strong>Strategic Axis 4: Integrating climate change adaptation into national sectoral strategies and policies </strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong> : Take adaptation into account in national and local planning and budgeting; Integrate the CC in the layout of the Territory; Conduct specific studies to better identify risks; Participate in international exchanges.</p>
<p>Twelve economic sectors were taken into account in each of the 5 AEZs to assess their vulnerability to the previous parameters:</p>
<p>- eight thematic sectors: Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries and Aquaculture, Forestry, Forestry and Wildlife, Water, Sanitation and Health, Energy, Mines and Industries, Urban Development and Public Works, Tourism;</p>
<p>- four transversal sectors, in accordance with the GESP: Education, Research and Vocational Training, Crafts and Social Economy, Telecommunications, Gender, Vulnerable Population, Social Protection and National Solidarity.</p>
<p>The impact analysis and vulnerability by ZAE and by sector shows us that:</p>
<p>- The most vulnerable zones are: Sudano-Sahelian ZAE and the coastal ZAE with monomodal rainfall;</p>
<p>- The most vulnerable sectors are (i) agriculture, and (ii) water, sanitation and health;</p>
<p>- About 320,000 people are exposed to climate disasters annually.</p>
<p>The vulnerability will be globally strong to very strong in zones 4 and 5, strong to medium in the rest of the country but with strong tendencies in the forest or mountain ranges. Despite the high variability by ZAE, we can estimate that for sectors:</p>
<p>- Agriculture: Vulnerability will be globally high to very high in zones 1, 2 and 4, high to medium in the rest of the country (droughts, rising temperatures);</p>
<p>- Livestock: Vulnerability will be globally high to very high in zones 1, 2 and 3, high to medium in the rest of the country (droughts, rising temperatures);</p>
<p>- Fisheries and aquaculture: Overall vulnerability will be high to medium throughout the country, especially in zones 5, 1 and 4, strong to medium in the rest of the country (droughts, rising temperatures);</p>
<p>- Forestry, forestry and wildlife: Vulnerability will be globally high to very high in zones 4 and 5, high to medium in the rest of the country but with strong trends in woodlands (droughts, extreme events);</p>
<p>- Water, sanitation and health: Vulnerability will be globally strong to very strong in zones 4 and 5, strong to medium in the rest of the country but with strong trends in the forested massifs (drought, floods and ground movement);</p>
<p>- Energy, mines and industries: Vulnerability will be strong to very strong in zones 5 and 2, high to medium in the rest of the country (precipitation, drought, sea level rise);</p>
<p>- Urban development and public works: Vulnerability will be generally strong to very strong in zones 5 and 4, high to medium in the rest of the country (floods, sea level rise);</p>
<p>- Tourism: Vulnerability will be generally average to low in the country, except in the mountainous massifs and Zone 1 (Drought).</p>
<p>The 2016-2025 intervention strategy (unencrypted) results in a <strong>preliminary five-year action plan for 2016-2020</strong> , broken down into 20 program sheets grouped below by general themes. Worksheets 1 to 5 relate to transversal projects, worksheets 6 to 20 sectoral projects. In general, the Client will be the MINEPAT, assisted by one or more technical structures (Ministry or Interministerial Coordination Committee) acting as delegated Project Owner or Project Manager. The amounts indicated, or $ 1.8 billion over 5 years, are indicative, based on 1) the amount of $ 16 per year per capita proposed by the World Bank for Sub-Saharan Africa <a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>and 2) on the hierarchy of sectoral priorities of the Government of Cameroon.
