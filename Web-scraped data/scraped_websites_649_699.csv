International Trade Union Confederation The International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) works to ensure that the Fundamental Workers’ Rights promoted by the ILO – the right to organize in a trade union, the right to collective bargaining, protection from discrimination, and the elimination of child labour and forced labour – are universally respected and enforced. ITUC stressed that social justice must mean, above all, distributive justice. The ILO Global Jobs Pact provides the framework for attaining such goal. ITUC endorsed the Pact immediately after its adoption and encouraged all its affiliate organizations and partners to take stock and use it jointly with government and employers in finding possible responses to the crisis.

Contents 1 History 2 Inaugural congress 2006 3 Second congress 2010 4 Organisation 5 Leadership 5.1 General Secretaries 5.2 Presidents 6 See also 7 References 8 Bibliography 9 External links History[edit] The federation was formed on 1 November 2006 out of the merger of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the World Confederation of Labour (WCL). The Founding Congress of the ITUC was held in Vienna and was preceded by the dissolution congresses of both the ICFTU and the WCL. The ITUC has three main regional organizations: the Asia-Pacific Regional Organization, the Trade Union Confederation of the Americas, and the African Regional Organisation.[1] The Trade Union Development Cooperation Network (TUDCN) is an initiative of the ITUC whose main objective is to bring the trade union perspective into international development policy debates and improve the coordination and effectiveness of trade union development cooperation activities.[2] The ITUC represents 207 million workers through its 331 affiliated organizations within 163 countries and territories.[3] Sharan Burrow is the current General Secretary.[4] The ITUC traces its origins back to the First International (also known as the International Workingmen's Association) and in 2014 commemorated the 150th anniversary of the founding of the International Working Men's Association at its own world congress held in Berlin. Also in 2014, the ITUC debuted the Global Rights Index, which ranks nations on 97 metrics pertaining to workers' rights, such as freedom from violent conditions and the right to strike and unionise.[5] According to the 2020 update of the Index, there has been a significant increase in violations of workers' rights around the world.[6] Inaugural congress 2006[edit] The founding congress of the ITUC was held from 1 to 3 November 2006 in Vienna, Austria. The first day of the congress saw the formal creation of the ITUC followed by an address by Juan Somavia, the Director-General of the International Labour Organization (ILO).[7] Day two included Pascal Lamy, the Director-General of the World Trade Organization (WTO) responding to panel discussions on the impact of globalisation, including the topics ""Cohesion and chaos - the global institutions"" and ""Global unions - global companies"". Technical difficulties limited Lamy's satellite video link participation. Leadership and officers were elected on the final day of the congress. Guy Ryder, the former general secretary of the ICFTU, was elected to the same position in the new organisation.[8] Sharan Burrow was elected president. A Governing Council was established, with 70 elected members, and 8 additional seats reserved for youth and women’s representatives. A Council of Global Unions was also formed on the final day of the congress. It was established jointly with ten global union federations and the Trade Union Advisory Committee to the OECD (TUAC). The Council will enable us to mobilize global membership around political and strategic initiatives and actions in order to confront global forces that work against the interests of working people and families.— Guy Ryder[9] Second congress 2010[edit] The second congress of the ITUC was held from 21 to 25 June 2010 in Vancouver, Canada. On 25 June 2010, at the conclusion of the congress, Sharan Burrow (then ITUC President) was elected General Secretary, succeeding Guy Ryder (who had been elected as Deputy Director General of the International Labour Organization).[10] In anticipation of her election, Burrow had resigned from her position as President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions effective 1 July 2010.[11] Speaking to the Congress after her election, Burrow paid tribute to her predecessor and emphasised the continuing role of organised labour in the world's emergence from the Global Financial Crisis. She also made special mention of the significance of her election as the first female leader of the world's largest trade union (against a background of high workforce participation by women and a Congress 50% of whose delegates were women[12]): I am a warrior for woman and we still have work to ensure the inclusion of women in the work place and in our unions. The struggles for women are multiple – too often within their families for independence, then in the workplace for rights and equal opportunity, in their unions for access and representation and then as union leaders. But the investment in and participation of women is not only a moral mandate it is an investment in democracy and a bulwark against fundamentalism and oppression. Organising woman is and must continue to be a priority for the ITUC.[13] Organisation[edit] Countries in light blue have an ITUC affiliate The Pan-European Regional Council (PERC), a European trade union organisation within the ITUC was formed 19 March 2007. It consists of 87 national trade union centres and a total membership of 87 million. It works closely with the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC). The ITUC raises capital through charging dues to its member organisations.[14] Leadership[edit] General Secretaries[edit] 2006: Guy Ryder 2010: Sharan Burrow Presidents[edit] 2006: Sharan Burrow 2010: Michael Sommer 2014: João Antonio Felicio 2018: Ayuba Wabba See also[edit] Organised labour portal Global union federation List of federations of trade unions World Federation of Trade Unions General Confederation of Trade Unions Decent work Global Rights Index References[edit] ^ ""About Us"".

For example, IUFRO is a Scientific Union Member of the International Council for Science (ICSU),[5] a member of the Collaborative Partnership on Forests (CPF), and an observer organization in the United Nations Forum on Forests, the Convention on Biological Diversity, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and other forest-related international processes and conventions. It has established memoranda of understanding with, for instance, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), World Conservation Union (IUCN), the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), the International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO), and International Forestry Students' Association (IFSA). IUFRO ODR Award. Photo by IUFRO. Communication and knowledge sharing[edit] IUFRO shares scientific knowledge and information with its members and stakeholders via its website iufro.org, the expertise of its officeholders, publications such as IUFRO News, IUFRO Spotlight, calendar of events, webinars,[6] information leaflets, annual reports, Occasional Papers, IUFRO World Series, IUFRO Research Series, and conference proceedings. In 2011, a Working Party on Communications and Public Relations was established as part of IUFRO Division 9 on Forest Policy and Economics. Honors and awards[edit] IUFRO honors through a variety of awards those who advance science and promote international cooperation in all fields of research related to forestry. Awards for scientific work include: Scientific Achievement Award (SAA) Outstanding Doctoral Research Award (ODRA) IUFRO Student Award for Excellence in Forest Science (ISA) IUFRO World Congress Host Scientific Award Best Poster Award (BPA) Organization[edit] The Organs of the Union are: Congress; International Council; Board and Committees; Management Committee; President (Dr John Parrotta[7]) and Vice-Presidents; Executive Director.

Photo by IUFRO. The Special Programme for Development of Capacities (IUFRO-SPDC) was established as ‘Special Programme for Developing Countries’ in 1983 at the request of the international donor community following a declaration of the XVII IUFRO World Congress in Kyoto, Japan in 1981. The declaration aimed to increase international support for the development of forestry research in less developed countries. SPDC aims to enhance the ability of research institutions to generate and deliver scientific information and offers advisory services on forest and trees and their sustainable utilization through training of scientists, collaborative research and thematic networking, scientist assistance program. The activities of SPDC include training workshops, scientist assistance and mobility programs as well as thematic networking especially in the field of forest and landscape restoration. The Global Forest Expert Panels (GFEP) were launched in April 2007, as a joint initiative of the Collaborative Partnership on Forests (CPF). Since then, the initiative has been led and coordinated by IUFRO. It builds on the political recognition provided by the United Nations Forum on Forests in the ECOSOC Resolution 2006/49. GFEP started as ""Joint CPF initiative on Forest Science and Technology"" and was later renamed. GFEP mainly produces interdisciplinary scientific assessment reports on key issues emerging from international policy debates. The reports are prepared by thematic Global Forest Expert Panels of scientific experts in their fields. The Special Project World Forests, Society and Environment (IUFRO-WFSE) is coordinated by the Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke). It is a global, open, collaborative network of scientists and experts from different parts of the world. WFSE focuses on topics recognised by the scientific community as important and having significant policy implications but appear not to be receiving adequate attention from the policy community. WFSE produces and disseminates scientific publications, policy and information briefs, and capacity-building materials. The Global Forest Information Service (GFIS) is an internet gateway that allows sharing of forest-related information through a single entry point. These resources are freely searchable online and provide direct access to the original information. The SilvaVoc Terminology Project emphasizes the importance of the correct usage of technical terms in forestry, and is the name of IUFRO's clearinghouse for multilingual forest terminology. It offers glossaries on specific topics and has built Silvaterm, a terminological database for forestry. History[edit] Participants of the 20th Meeting of the German forest research institutes, Eberswalde, Germany, September, 1892. This committee decided on 19 September 1892 the establishment of the International Union of Forest Research Institutes Forests have always been an important for economic development and environmental maintenance.[8] In 1890 the International Agriculture and Forestry Congress in Vienna, Austria, proposed to establish a ""central organ"" for applied forest research in the European countries. As a consequence, the “International Union of Forest Experiment Organizations” was founded in Eberswalde, Germany, in 1892. Originally, only Austria, Germany and Switzerland agreed that their forest experiment stations would join the Union. By the beginning of World War I, stations from 22 countries, including USA, Canada and Japan, had become members.[9] During World War I international cooperation stopped, as did forest research in many of the countries involved in the war. The Union only fully resumed its activities in 1929 when the new name “International Union of Forestry Research Organizations” was adopted. In the years to follow, the organization lost its Central European character as more representatives from Africa, Asia and the Americas joined. World War II reduced the activities of the Union to a minimum. Cooperation continued only between individuals, and not on an institutional basis. In 1949 the newly established Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) declared its readiness to make available to IUFRO a secretariat at FAO’s own Headquarters in Rome.[6] Commemorating 100 years of IUFRO in Eberswalde, Germany, in 1992. Photo by IUFRO IUFRO has played an essential role in establishing standards and harmonizing field investigations in forest research. In 1903 the Union initiated international forestry bibliographies that did not exist earlier. Gradually the development led to the well-known Oxford System of Decimal Classification (ODe) for Forestry in the 1950s[9][10] The 1950s and 1960s were a period of steady growth. The XV IUFRO World Congress in Gainesville, USA, in 1971 was the first Congress held outside Europe. For the first time, it was referred to as a “World Congress,” and a Congress title was introduced: “The Role of Research in the Intensification of Forestry Practices and Activities.”[5] In the 1980s, IUFRO started to increasingly address forest-related social, economic, and ecological problems of global importance. The XVIII World Congress held in Ljubljana, Yugoslavia, in 1986 was the first to take place in Eastern Europe. Since the 1990s the focus of the community of forest policymakers, economists and managers has changed. This is as societal expectations regarding forests broadened to include enhanced production of forest goods, social benefits, and environmental services through sustainable management of trees and forests. IUFRO responded to these challenges by adapting its scientific structure, expanding strategic partnerships and engaging more at the science/policy interface. The XXI IUFRO World Congress in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in 2000 was the first IUFRO World Congress to be held in a developing country. In 2000 the name of the Union was changed once more into “International Union of Forest Research Organizations”. The year 2000 also marked the first time in IUFRO´s history that gender issues were formally addressed. Over the last ten years, IUFRO undertook efforts to expand the scope of work beyond ‘traditional’ sectoral and disciplinary boundaries. At the 125th Anniversary Congress in 2017 in Freiburg, Germany, the slogan “Interconnecting Forests, Science and People” was adopted as part of the logo.[6] See also[edit] International Day of Forests References[edit] ^ Nikolakis, William; Innes, John (19 September 2014).

(PKP S.A.; English: Polish State Railways, Inc.) is the dominant railway operator in Poland. The company was founded when the former Polskie Koleje Państwowe state-owned enterprise was divided into several units based on the need for separation between infrastructure management and transport operations. PKP S.A. is the dominant company in PKP Group collective that resulted from the split, and maintains in 100% share control, being fully responsible for the assets of all of the other PKP Group component companies. The group's organisations are dependent upon PKP S.A., but proposals for privatisation have been made.[4] Contents 1 PKP today 1.1 Pricing system 1.2 Development of current services, infrastructure and high-speed rail 2 History 3 Corporate Subdivisions 3.1 PKP Intercity 3.2 PKP Cargo 3.3 PKP Szybka Kolej Miejska 3.4 PKP Linia Hutnicza Szerokotorowa 4 Transfer of regional services to Przewozy Regionalne 5 Power supply 6 Other PKP subsidiary companies 6.1 Polskie Linie Kolejowe 6.2 PKP Energetyka 6.3 WARS S.A. 7 See also 8 References 9 External links PKP today[edit] Pricing system[edit] The pricing system currently employed by PKP is highly regressive. On international routes such as, for example, the Berlin-Warsaw Express and the IC-Nightbus Warsaw – Vilnius, a global pricing system is in use which requires one to buy two separate tickets (one in each direction) in place of a single consolidated return ticket. The long-distance and local trains' pricing systems are separated from each other in entirety and thus tickets issued by local train operators cannot be used on long-distance services, with the opposite also true. International tickets, however, are valid on all services upon which one is required to travel on order to reach the final destination stated on the ticket (unless a specific routing is stipulated in the terms of the conditions of use). Development of current services, infrastructure and high-speed rail[edit] See also: High-speed_rail_in_Poland § Warsaw_to_Poznań_and_Wrocław_via_Łódź One of the 10 newest electric locomotives Siemens ES64U4 in use by PKP since 2008 Wrocław Main Station Since 2009 PKP's subdivision Polskie Linie Kolejowe (Polish Railway Lines) has been using the new 'Dworzec Polski' (Polish Station) brand. This branding and its corresponding PR campaign 'ROBI SIĘ!' (IT'S GETTING READY!) was developed in order to shed more light on station redevelopments all around the country. The ethos of the brand essentially requires that the station in question be completely transformed to meet the highest modern standards of comfort and technical service before being allowed to become a member of the 'Dworzec Polski' network. Currently, there are 77 stations taking part in the 'ROBI SIĘ!' programme, amongst which are included the main stations of Warsaw, Katowice, Kraków, Wrocław, and Gdynia.[5] History[edit] Main article: History of rail transport in Poland PKP's Pm36 locomotive won a gold medal at the 1937 International Exposition of Art and Technology in Paris A steam engine of the Warsaw–Terespol railway, 1866 Regaining independence on 11 November 1918 allowed Poland to reclaim the former Russian and Austrian sectors from military railways. The Railway Department in the Ministry of Communication was created and the Polish railways were officially named Polskie Koleje Państwowe. In December 1918, the Greater Poland Uprising started. The rebels took over the former Prussian sector of railways. One year later, the fights for Lwów were over and the former Austrian railway directorate was taken over by Poland. Taking over the railways from Prussians lasted until 1921. After the victory over the Red Army in the Polish-Bolshevik War (1920), a great deal of damage in railway structure was discovered on the route along which the communists were retreating. At the same time, the tense relations with Lithuania led the railways around Vilnius and Minsk to a partial disintegration and stagnation. The Libau–Romny Railway was not recovered. Polish railways administration finally took over the railways in Upper Silesia in 1922. That same year, a decision was made to divide railways in Poland into nine administrative districts. An economic crisis in the 1930s forced the state to cut back its budget for railway investment. Profit decreased by 50% compared to 1929. The next year, over 23,000 PKP employees had been dismissed and protests and strikes causes authorities to try to find a solution. The end of the crisis and an increase in cargo transport and income came in 1937. On 1 September 1939, the railwaymen of Szymankowo stopped a German armoured train before its arrival on the bridge over the Vistula River and the Polish soldiers reattached the explosive charges disconnected by the German dive bombers and blew up the bridge. The railwaymen and some of their innocent family members were executed by the Germans the same day, 1 September 1939. After the Soviet invasion of eastern Poland on 17 September 1939, most Polish rolling stock fell into Soviet hands. Gdańsk Główny is one of Poland's largest category A stations. The Polish railways in Silesia, Greater Poland and Pomerania were adopted by German railways Deutsche Reichsbahn on 25 September. The Polish railways in Generalgouvernement became Ostbahn. Until the last moment before the German attack on the Soviet Union in 1941, cargo trains transported goods from the Soviet Union to Germany. The beginning of German attacks on the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941 resulted in the possession of railway and rolling stock by the Ostbahn and the possession of PKP rolling stock with broad gauge track and reconstruction to standard gauge. The beginning of organized sabotage by the Polish resistance movement on railways took place about the same time. PKP headquarters in Wrocław In 1942, production of simple military-use DR Kriegslok BR52 (PKP class Ty2) steam locomotives began in Poznań and Chrzanów; the steam boilers for these locomotives were produced in Sosnowiec. The Warsaw Uprising caused widespread damage of Warsaw rolling stock, network and electric traction; both bridges over the Vistula River and the tunnel on the Warsaw Cross-City Line were destroyed. At the beginning of 1945, the Ministry of Transport was created, as well as the Regional Directorate of National Railways. Many pre-war locomotives were sent to the Soviet Union. Poland received many German locomotives as a compensation for war losses. In June, the rail connection with Warsaw was opened, using a temporary railway station made of warehouses. On 15 September 1945, PKP took over management of all railway lines on new Polish territory from the Soviet Union. Most of these lines were either destroyed or inaccessible. The railways in the country were divided into ten districts. Dot matrix information board on a Polish PKP Intercity train from Berlin to Gdynia via Gdańsk During the mid-to-late communist era, the state of the Polish railways deteriorated to a large extent. Once a large and profitable network, the systemic lack of funding and failure to acquire new rolling stock left PKP far behind the railway operators of Western Europe in terms of technical advances and passenger comfort. In addition to this, the poor state of many rail lines throughout the country led to ever-increasing journey times for passengers, and as a result left the railways far less able to compete with intercity bus and air services. During the entire communist period, only one major infrastructural project relating to the railways was completed. This, the Central Trunk Line, was a prestige project completed in 1976, intended both for heavy coal transport and fast passenger services. This line for the first time allowed passengers to travel in comfort and at relatively high speed from Kraków and Katowice to Warsaw; however, high-speed services have never started, although test runs reached 250 km/h in 1994. Moreover, despite the successful completion of the section from southern to central Poland, the planned extension to Gdańsk and the country's Baltic ports was never realised, and this significantly curtailed both the usefulness and potential of the line. Since Poland's return to the sovereignty in the early 1990s, the Polish State Railways have faced ever-increasing competition from private automotive transport and the country's rapidly expanding network of motorways and express roads. However, ever-decreasing journey times, better schedules which allow for well-coordinated connections, the rise of private operators and large-scale investment in infrastructure as well as new rolling stock is slowly enticing people back onto the railways.[6] On 14 December 2014 PKP Intercity Pendolino trains began operating on the CMK line (224 km line from Kraków and Katowice to Warsaw) with trains reaching 200 km/h (124 mph) as a regularly scheduled operation. There is a plan by PKP Polskie Linie Kolejowe (infrastructure manager) to increase speed to 250 km/h on whole line soon.[7] In the day of 13 December 2020 the speed limit was raised to 200 km/h also on the line from Warsaw to seaport Gdynia by New Pendolino train.[8] Corporate Subdivisions[edit] PKP Intercity[edit] Railway connections by PKP Intercity and Polregio A PKP Intercity ED250 New Pendolino at Wrocław Main Station Main article: PKP Intercity PKP Intercity is a semi-independent division of PKP that operates long-distance passenger trains in Poland. It was founded in 2001 when, in preparation for separation between infrastructure management and transport operations, the Polish State Railways were reorganized into a number of independent operating companies under the unified direction of the PKP Group. PKP Intercity operates all InterCity trains in Poland as well as most of the country's EuroCity services throughout Europe. Although competition is rising in the long-distance rail travel market in Poland, PKP Intercity still holds a de facto monopoly in the industry, as its current market share represents almost 100% of the segment. PKP Intercity's trains currently (2015) operate under the following brands: Express InterCity Premium (EIP) - Pendolino high-speed trains EuroCity (EC): International trains which operate major routes and require a reservation Express InterCity (EIC) - introduced in 2009, as a result, the train category EX was phased out InterCity (IC) - Intercity trains Twoje Linie Kolejowe (TLK) - Low cost, intercity trains InterCityBus (ICBUS)- Intercity coach services PKP Cargo[edit] A PKP Cargo locomotive Main article: PKP Cargo PKP Cargo (WSE: PKP), founded in 2001 so as to satisfy a European Court ruling on the required restructuring of the Polish State Railways prior to joining the EU, is the PKP group company responsible for freight transport operations. It is currently the largest railway cargo carrier in Poland, and second-largest in the European Union. The company was founded after dividing Polskie Koleje Państwowe (all-national rail operator) into several dozens of companies to meet European Union Standards.[9] PKP Cargo is owned by the PKP S.A. (50% + 1 share) and private investors. PKP Szybka Kolej Miejska[edit] Main article: Szybka Kolej Miejska (Tricity) It is a railway transportation service that originally functioned in Poland's Tricity area (Gdynia, Sopot and Gdańsk). The system has since grown to cover a longer route, reaching towns like Słupsk, Lębork and Wejherowo. It is serviced by electric multiple unit cars at a frequency of 6 minutes to half an hour between trains (depending on the time of day). It is comparable to subway service or light rail in other European cities. The Tricity area is uniquely suited for this mode of transport, as it's shaped in a relatively narrow north–south corridor between the Gdańsk Bay and the Tricity Landscape Park.[10] PKP Linia Hutnicza Szerokotorowa[edit] Main article: PKP Linia Hutnicza Szerokotorowa PKP LHS is a company of the PKP Group responsible for infrastructure operation and freight transport on the Broad Gauge Metallurgy Line. The line runs for about 400 km from the Polish-Ukrainian border in Izow-Hrubieszów to Sławków Południowy (near Katowice). The line was opened in 1979 and was used to import iron ore from the USSR, as well as to export coal and sulphur from Poland. After the fall of communism and the economic changes of 1989 traffic on the line has much diminished. At present various schemes are being tried to increase its profitability. This line runs as a single-track line for almost 400 km, from the Polish-Ukrainian border crossing just east of Hrubieszów to Sławków Południowy (near Katowice). It is used only for freight traffic, mainly iron ore and coal. It is the westernmost broad gauge railway line in Europe that is connected to the broad gauge rail system of the countries which before 1991 constituted the Soviet Union. Transfer of regional services to Przewozy Regionalne[edit] Main article: Przewozy Regionalne SA135 Until December 22, 2008, Przewozy Regionalne was a wholly owned subsidiary of the PKP Group; after that date, all of its shares have been transferred to Poland's 16 regional governments.[11] Thus, the company is no longer part of the PKP Group and on interregional routes its InterRegio trains compete with PKP Intercity TLK trains. This was done in order to increase competition amongst operators on the Polish rail network. The company finally changed its name from PKP Przewozy Regionalne to Przewozy Regionalne on December 8, 2009. Przewozy Regionalne now operates a large range of domestic rail services under the following brands: Regio (local passenger services which stop at all stations), RegioPlus (semi-fast local passenger services which stop at a lesser number of stops than Regio but for which tickets do not cost more), InterRegio (low-cost, fast inter-regional services with 2nd class only and which stop at medium and major stations only) and RegioEkspres (fast trains on international routes with both 1st and 2nd class). For domestic routes, InterRegio and RegioEkspres trains share the same fare for 2nd class (meaning you can board an RE train with an IR ticket and vice versa). With the exception of the Szczecin-Warsaw and Poznań-Warsaw RegioEkspres trains, there is no reservation required in any of Przewozy Regionalne's trains. Until December 1, 2008, the company also used to run over 300 interregional and international fast trains (pociąg pospieszny), but per the government's decision, all its interregional and international fast train services were transferred back to its then-sister company, PKP Intercity S.A. and rebranded to 'Tanie Linie Kolejowe' (Cheap Railway Lines), this was then itself renamed in 2010 to 'Twoje Linie Kolejowe' (Your Railway Lines). Przewozy Regionalne trains are currently operated under the following brands: 2015 Regio InterRegio RegioExpress InterRegioBus - BUS Power supply[edit] Electric train traction of Polish State Railway started in 1936 in Warsaw area and is performed since the beginning with 3 kV DC. On January 1, 2011, 11481 kilometres were electrified by a total length of 19276 kilometres. All used power is taken from the public grid and rectified in substations. Most substations are fed with voltages between 15 and 30 kV. Where lines have heavy traffic and higher speed, the substations are fed from the 110 kV grid. The switchyard of substations fed from voltages below 30 kV is indoors, outdoor switchgear is used at 110 kV. The distance between substations is between 15 and 28 kilometres. For reliability of supply, substations are usually fed by at least two powerlines. Each substation normally feeds two segments of the overhead wire, which are separated by a switch. As is common with DC systems, the negative pole is grounded. Halfway between two substations, there is a switch, which can be used to connect the overhead wires together. At some lines, a three-phase AC line operated with 6 kV, 15 kV or 20 kV runs parallel to the railway line, either on the poles of the overhead wire or on separate poles. It is used for power supply of signals, level crossing equipment and other devices requiring electric power used for the rail. This line can be also used for emergency power supply of substations. Other PKP subsidiary companies[edit] Polskie Linie Kolejowe[edit] Main article: PKP Polskie Linie Kolejowe The PKP Group company responsible for maintenance of rail tracks, conducting trains across the country, scheduling train timetables, and management of railway property, such as lines and stations. PKP Energetyka[edit] Main article: PKP Energetyka A company of PKP Group, responsible for supplying Polish railroad operators with electric energy. PKP Energetyka was founded after dividing PKP into a group of several dozen independent companies to meet European Union Standards. PKP Group has sold PKP Energetyka. WARS S.A.[edit] WARS is the PKP subsidiary responsible for the servicing of restaurant and sleeper cars on long-distance and international trains operated by PKP Intercity and their partners.

Its members — the operators of the world’s railways — have, over the years, developed the “UIC code” comprising UIC leaflets, which define common rules to ensure safety and efficiency in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of the railway system. Many of these rules are also applied outside the railway operating community. Rail transport is about offering an attractive product to the customer which they choose to use as their land transport mode of choice. It is also about technical harmonisation and compatibility: Compatibility between infrastructure and tracks, and the rolling stock that operates on these tracks Compatibility between traction units and various sources of energy supply Compatibility train to train, thanks to signalling and traffic management systems designed to protect the trains from accidental contact and collisions with other trains or obstacles For rail traffic operations to be safe and compatible, it makes common sense that they adhere to standardised rules based on technical harmonisation. Technical harmonisation enables connections to be made between railway lines and, on a larger scale, between railway networks – thus enabling intercontinental corridors to link several continents by rail.

Contents 1 History 2 Mission 3 Objectives 4 Members 5 Standard terminology 6 Classification of railway vehicles 7 Some UIC regulations 8 See also 9 References 10 External links History[edit] The railways of Europe originated as many separate concerns, and there were many border changes after World War I and the Treaty of Versailles. Colonial railways were the responsibility of the mother country. Into this environment the UIC was created on 17 October 1922,[2] with the aim of standardising industry practices. Ticket revenue sharing was originally undertaken with the UIC Franc currency equivalent. UIC classification and UIC Country Codes allowed precise determination of rolling stock capabilities and ownership, with wagons assigned unique UIC wagon numbers. The 1990s GSM-R radio telecommunication system is an international interoperability specification covering voice and signalling systems for railway communications whose specification is maintained by the International Union of Railways project European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS). Mission[edit] The UIC's mission is ""to promote rail transport at world level and meet the challenges of mobility and sustainable development.""[3] Objectives[edit] The UIC's main objectives[3] are to: Facilitate the sharing of best practices among members (benchmarking) Support members in their efforts to develop new business and new areas of activities Propose new ways to improve technical and environmental performance Promote interoperability, create new world standards for railways (including common standards with other transport modes) Develop centres of competence (High Speed, Safety, Security, e-Business, ...) Members[edit] When founded in 1922 the UIC had 51 members from 29 countries, including Japan and China. They were soon joined by members from the Soviet Union, the Middle East and North Africa. Today, the UIC has 194 members[4] across five continents.[3] Of these there are: 73 active members (including from Afghanistan, China, Europe, India, Japan, Kazakhstan, South Korea, the Middle East, North Africa, Pakistan, Russia, South Africa and Taiwan,[5] and companies operating worldwide such as Transdev) 68 associate members (including from Africa, the Americas, Asia and Australia) 53 affiliate members (related or ancillary businesses or services) On 12 November 2010, the UIC opened an African regional office in Tunis, Tunisia with the support of SNCFT.[6] Standard terminology[edit] In order to provide a common understanding and reduce potential confusion, the UIC has established standard international railway terminology and a trilingual (English-French-German) thesaurus of terms. The thesaurus was the result of cooperation with the European Conference of Ministers of Transport (ECMT/CEMT) and was published in 1995.[7] Classification of railway vehicles[edit] Main articles: UIC classification of goods wagons, UIC classification of locomotive axle arrangements, UIC classification of railway coaches, UIC identification marking for tractive stock, and UIC wagon numbers The UIC has established systems for the classification of locomotives and their axle arrangements, coaches and goods wagons. Some UIC regulations[edit] UIC plays an important role in standardization of railway parts, data and terminology. Therefore, UIC codes (also known as UIC leaflet) are developed since the beginning of UIC's work. A new term for these UIC leaflets is used by UIC for better understanding: International Railway Solution (IRS).[8] Some UIC codes are: UIC 568 The 13-corded standardized connection cable with connector is used to transmit data and commands between the locomotive and the carriages of a passenger train. UIC 592-2 Large containers for transport on wagons - Technical conditions to be fulfilled by large containers accepted for use in international traffic. Describes the classes and categories of large containers, handling characteristics, identification markings, and special conditions applying to large tank containers. UIC 592-3 Large containers (CT), swap bodies (CM) and transport frames for horizontal transhipment (CA) - Standard report on acceptance tests. UIC 592-4 Swap bodies for grab handling and spreader gripping - Technical conditions. Swap bodies are the removable superstructures of road transport vehicles. Their dimensions and some of their fittings are standardised, particularly dimensions, strength parameters and securing devices, of the road vehicle, the wagon and transhipment arrangements (grab-handling grooves, lower securing parts and, in special cases, upper securing parts). UIC 596-5 Transport of road vehicles on wagons - Technical organisation - Conveyance of semi-trailers with P coding or N coding on recess wagons. This leaflet sets out regulations and provisions for semi-trailers with normal road transport characteristics for conveyance on fixed-recess carrier wagons. The provisions are valid for semi-trailers, gantry equipment/industrial trucks with grab handles, recess wagon types 1a and 1b in accordance with UIC Leaflet 571–4. UIC 596-6 Conveyance of road vehicles on wagons - Technical organisation - Conditions for coding combined-transport load units and combined-transport lines. The leaflet sets out the coding and organisation of loading units in respect of road vehicles on wagons, designed to ensure compatibility of loading units (LU) with the permissible profile for combined transport lines. The provisions aim to facilitate LU identification to speed-up international traffic movements. They are applicable to semi-trailers, swap bodies, roller units loaded on wagons and bogies in combined transport operations.

The railways remain an institution setting great store by service excellence and openness to progress. Over the coming years, they will have to capitalise on these assets in order to survive, win and grow, particularly by: Developing the overall coherence of the rail system at world level Developing strategies and initiatives to improve business performance and increase rail transport investment; Executing and managing projects/activities on non-commercial issues, including research, development and technical efficiency as far as necessary for the topic concerned. UIC, the worldwide professional association representing the railway sector and promoting rail transport UIC leads an innovative and dynamic sector, helping Members find continuing success and opportunities. Members are invited to take a proactive role in the UIC working groups and assemblies where the railways’ position on regional/worldwide issues is shaped. Active participation in the working groups is a unique opportunity to voice opinions and benefit from the weight of the railway sector at a coordinated worldwide level. UIC is the asso­ciation for technical cooperation amongst railways, and coordinates the sector’s position as it negotiates its evolving relationship with the supply industry and research and develops needs in order to draw full advantage of potential interest to railway companies. Members are regularly informed of key developments on the dossiers UIC deals with and which impact on their activities. This allows Members to anticipate regulatory and technical changes and integrate them effectively and more smoothly into their own business operational processes. The mission and overall objectives for UIC activities result from the statutes that were unanimously adopted by the UIC Members at the General Assembly on 31 March 2009. In accordance with the statutes, UIC’s mission has following main focuses: Overall objectives for UIC To enable UIC to effectively fulfil its mission, 3 levels have been defined for international cooperation activities: Strategic level: coordination with and bet­ween the 6 UIC Regions created as part of the new Governance (activities steered by the UIC Regional Assemblies for Africa, Asia, North America, South America, Europe and Middle-East). Technical/professional cooperation level (structured around the following railway activities): Passenger, Freight, Rail System – including infrastructure, rolling stock, opera­tions – and Fundamental Values including cross-sector activities such as Sustainable Development, Research Coordination, Safety, Security, Expertise Development). Strategic priorities for technical cooperation activities are set out by forums and platforms composed of member representatives. Support services level: (Finance, Human Resources, Legal, Communications and Institutional Relations). The UIC Executive Board and General Assembly additionally approved on 8 December 2009 the Chairman’s proposal to focus further UIC activities on 5 key areas to be developed in the interest of the worldwide railway community: Environment, Safety and Security, Signalling, Freight / Freight Corridors, Standardisation. Vital points of the UIC action 5 areas have been determined as vital points to serve the global community. The table recalls the 5 areas and for each theme gives the key subjects addressed in 2012. Global topicsProjects / Activities / Specific actions Freight Heavy trains Long trains - Paperless documentation - Global Rail Freight Conference (GRFC) - Business Plans - GTE - ERI Signalling CCS Conference Environment CO2 reduction and rail transport communication - work with international environment entities Safety / Security Safety and Security Congresses and conferences - Level Crossing - Safety database and enquiries Standardisation Energy or GHG measures - Asset Management - Terminology (RailLexic) Three leading values:“Unity, Solidarity, Universality” At the General Assembly on 6 June 2009, UIC Members unanimously agreed to structure UIC’s work around three core “values”: UnityUIC is the professional and technical association representing the unity of the railway sector at world level. Some specific activities are organised at regional level and monitored by the 6 Regional Assemblies. Whenever possible and useful for the railway community, efforts will be made to convert regional projects into multi-regional or global activities. SolidarityUIC represents Members with different features and levels of development. UIC will maintain its efforts to narrow the divide between the different situations, in particular by promoting exchanges of information, experience and best practice across the world. In addition, the General Assembly decided on 31 March 2009 to create a tool for financing specific solidarity actions with a dedicated solidarity fund. UniversalityUIC’s scope of activities is global and embraces the universality of railway topics. UIC can create a framework to develop new projects on all kinds of issues requested by Members. International projects may be developed within UIC study bodies for all issues needed by member railways. These can be topics related to specific railway technology (technology, operations, research) or more general cooperation activities (IT, Human Resources and Training, Regulatory and Legal, etc.).

State representatives favoured the “creation of a permanent rail administration focusing on international traffic for the standardisation and improvement of conditions of railway construction and operations “. The international conference founding UIC was held in Paris on 17 October 1922. Initially the UIC had 51 members from 29 countries including Japan and China, which were soon joined by the railways from the USSR, the Middle East and North Africa.UIC Activity Report UIC Activity Report 2019 2 July 2020 - PDF - 7.1 Mb View UIC Activity Report 2018 9 July 2019 - PDF - 5.2 Mb View UIC Work programme UIC Work programme 2020-2022 17 March 2020 - PDF - 6.4 Mb View UIC Corporate Brochure / UIC Membership Package UIC - The worldwide railway organisation (2017) Corporate brochure 10 April 2017 - PDF - 3.1 Mb View UIC - L’organisation mondiale des chemins de fer (2017) Brochure de présentation 23 May 2017 - PDF - 3.1 Mb View UIC Technical Solutions for the operational railway As the main technical body serving not only railway operators, but the entire community of railway stakeholders, including research centres and universities, UIC is a natural forum for bringing together all stakeholders and for developing collaborative global solutions.

We promote the rights of Indigenous Peoples We defend Indigenous Peoples across the globe We defend Indigenous Peoples across the globe HomeFocus Areas IWGIA is a non-governmental human rights organisation promoting, protecting and defending Indigenous Peoples’ collective and individual rights. We believe that Indigenous Peoples as rights holders are powerful agents of change. Our partnership with their organisations and institutions is at the centre of all our work. Indigenous Peoples today, in all parts of the world, are still fighting discrimination and targeted violence, struggling against a shrinking civic space, lacking recognition of their rights as peoples, and suffering from land dispossession, evictions and the negative consequences of climate change and conservation efforts.Together with allies, and in solidarity with Indigenous Peoples, our core ambition is that Indigenous Peoples’ rights to land, territories and resources and their self-determined development are promoted, respected and protected.We implement four focused and results-driven thematic programmes to drive change with and for our partners. CLIMATE CHANGEDespite being recognised for their environmental stewardship, Indigenous Peoples are not only disproportionally affected by climate change, they are also increasingly negatively impacted by top-down mitigation and adaptation efforts on their lands and territories. IWGIA’s Climate Change programme strives to ensure that the impact of climate change and climate action on Indigenous Peoples’ rights is promptly addressed and remedied, while simultaneously guaranteeing that Indigenous Peoples themselves are acknowledged and consulted as key actors in realising their rights and contributors to climate change solutions through their knowledge. Read more about our Climate Change programme here LAND DEFENCE AND DEFENDERSIndigenous Peoples are losing their lands every day, and this has particularly devastating effects on Indigenous women. Indigenous Peoples are being criminalised, harassed or even killed for attempting to protect their territories. IWGIA’s Land Defence and Defenders programme leverages Indigenous Peoples’ efforts to safely and securely claim and exercise their rights to land, territories and natural resources at national, regional and international levels. Read more about our Land Defence and Defenders programme here TERRITORIAL GOVERNANCEIndigenous territorial self-government or autonomy is an exercise in selfdetermination. IWGIA’s Territorial Governance programme reinforces the creation and consolidation of Indigenous self-governance and autonomy. It promotes dialogue with national authorities and international human rights mechanisms for the recognition of Indigenous governments and supports their articulation of diverse autonomous experiences. Read more about our Territorial Governance programme here GLOBAL GOVERNANCEIndigenous Peoples’ rights have been recognised at the international level. However, for Indigenous Peoples’ rights to be respected and protected, they must be recognised and operationalised at national and local levels. IWGIA’s Global Governance programme strengthens global-to-local linkages between national and international processes across all its thematic programmes. Knowledge of international processes and legal instruments for redress of human rights violations helps strengthen the position and demands of Indigenous Peoples towards states, enabling them to seek redress. This programme also strengthens Indigenous Peoples’ participation in and contribution to relevant global decision-making processes, such as implementation of the 2030 Agenda. Read more about our Global Governance programme here CROSS-CUTTING METHODOLOGIESWe implement three cross-cutting and integrated methodologies to further strengthen our four thematic programmes and ensure we take a bottom-up approach. We do so by building flexibility within our programming, ensuring we apply a focus on Indigenous women in all our work and investing in data generation and analysis to enhance our monitoring tools. SMALL GRANTS FACILITYWe operate a Small Grants Facility (SGF), which is a cornerstone of our modus operandi. The objective of the SGF is to provide an instrument that allows us to respond flexibly to the needs and opportunities defined by Indigenous Peoples’ organisations. This allows us to work in a bottom-up, partner-driven way, reacting swiftly and flexibly to urgent needs on the ground. SGF-supported projects fall within our overall goals and priorities as spelled out in this Institutional Strategy, with an overarching focus on strengthening Indigenous Peoples’ rights to land, territories and natural resources and to selfdetermined development. In line with our priorities, they will also have a focus on the inclusion and empowerment of women and youth. IWGIA will grow and expand the SGF by attracting more partners and financial resources to bolster our support to Indigenous organisations and movements on the ground. INDIGENOUS WOMEN MAINSTREAMINGIndigenous women experience a broad, multifaceted and complex spectrum of mutually reinforcing human rights abuses. They are disproportionately affected by systemic discrimination, excluded from local and national political processes, and the targets of multiple forms of violence. We will provide assistance and support to projects directly developed and implemented by Indigenous women’s organisations that focus on empowering Indigenous women and strengthening their leadership through awareness raising, civic education, and supporting their participation in the development and review of legislation, policies and practices that affect them. We will also pay particular attention to Indigenous women in relation to the prevention and elimination of all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls, access to justice and remedies.Additionally, we will, through our Indigenous Navigator project, contribute to the development of comprehensive and disaggregated data on violence and discrimination against Indigenous women, including their access to justice and to economic, social and cultural rights, as well as other quantitative and qualitative information that may be relevant to ensure their human rights. We will also develop methodological tools to ensure that Indigenous women are part of all our projects and programmes. To achieve this, we will carry out a gender audit, update our gender policy and ensure all our partners are aware of and sensitised to the inclusion of Indigenous women. DATA GENERATION AND ANALYSISThe world lacks the full picture of the marginalisation and discrimination against Indigenous Peoples due to a lack of disaggregated data. Indigenous Peoples are therefore often left behind when general development trends in a country do not take into consideration their unique socioeconomic and political circumstances. As the human rights-based approach to development has shown, if there is no disaggregated data on Indigenous Peoples, they will remain invisible, their rights will continue to be disregarded in the context of implementing the Sustainable Development Goals and they will be left behind.IWGIA engages with data on multiple levels. More than simply generating data, IWGIA shares critical data, ensures data quality is preserved – building trust and legitimacy – and drives discourse forward on data standards in relation to Indigenous Data Sovereignty. These multiple levels of data generation and management allow us to produce critical documentation work that drives forward our advocacy and to develop monitoring frameworks that can better understand and recognise the implementation gap in relation to Indigenous Peoples’ rights, as guaranteed by international mechanisms. Such uses can be seen in the Indigenous Navigator initiative, which directly addresses the implementation gap through the collection and use of data in advocacy efforts and project design for Indigenous communities and organisations. The initiative also focuses on the role of data at the local level and how it can serve to empower Indigenous communities through, for example, environmental monitoring by communities or determining their own locally and culturally appropriate well-being indicators.By ensuring that our partners have access to raw data and the ability to produce, interpret and refine it into usable outputs, IWGIA is making certain that data becomes more than just numbers or characters, and instead evolves into a meaningful tool for change.IWGIA aims to strengthen our capacity to collect, analyse and communicate data so that we are better positioned to provide focused, specific support to our global network while fortifying international and global advocacy efforts that rely on quantitative and qualitative analysis. By 2025, we aim to increase our data capacity for monitoring, reporting and evaluation in our various initiatives and products, including The Indigenous World and Indigenous Navigator.

IWGIA's work is primarily funded by the Nordic Ministries of Foreign Affairs and the European Union. IWGIA holds consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and has observer status with the Arctic Council and with the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights. Contents 1 History 2 Activities 3 See also 4 References 5 External links History[edit] The constitution of the IWGIA as a body was first proposed and initiated in August 1968, at the 38th International Congress of Americanists, held in Munich and Stuttgart. Formed as a co-operative of academic anthropologist researchers and human rights activists, the IWGIA was initially concerned with redressing the threats posed by the rapid development of settlements and industries to the indigenous groups living in the Amazon Basin. A network for indigenous advocacy and activism was first established in Brazil and Paraguay, with the IWGIA later expanding its activities and involvement to the concerns of indigenous American peoples generally. Subsequently, the IWGIA's working groups, advocacy support and research publications extended to cover indigenous issues across all continental regions of the globe. IWGIA was one of the first organisations to be established in support of indigenous peoples. It was founded in 1968 by anthropologists concerned at the atrocities being committed against Indians in South America. Within a few years, a small group of dedicated scholars working on a voluntary basis had managed to establish a documentation centre that became well-known to concerned people the world over. The project grew to encompass international human rights work, empowerment projects, publishing and information dissemination.[4] Since the May 28, 2000 adoption of changes to its statutes, the IWGIA has been incorporated as a membership organization, whose base membership contributes an annual subscription fee towards the running of the organization and funding of its activities. Activities[edit] 2019 saw an improvement in the statistics and data surrounding Indigenous Peoples. The International Labour Organisation published a lower-bound estimate of 476 million Indigenous people globally.[5] IWGIA's work was cited in the report, while the World Bank and ILO both acknowledge that despite Indigenous Peoples making up only 6% of the global population, they make up 15% of the world’s extreme poor.[6] IWGIA support indigenous peoples' organisations through its regional and thematic programmes. As of December 2019, IWGIA has changed its institutional focus from three regional programmes - on Africa, Latin America and Asia - and one country programme, supporting indigenous peoples in the Russian Federation, plus a programme on climate change, supporting indigenous participation in international climate change processes and local activities and awareness raising related to national REDD+ strategies to four thematic programmes. The four thematic programmes IWIGA works with in 2019 are climate,[7] land rights,[8] Indigenous rights defenders at risk,[9] and global governance.[10] Alongside these thematic programmes are programmes on communications and documentation and alliances and engagement. The Publications programme has been integrated into communications and documentation and includes the publication of IWGIA's yearbook ""The Indigenous World"", as well as a variety of books, human rights reports, briefing papers, manuals and videos mostly in English and Spanish. However, IWGIA has also occasionally published in Danish, Hindi, French and other languages.

IWGIA was formed by a group of anthropologists who had heard disturbing reports of the annihilation of indigenous peoples in South America and decided to fight along with indigenous peoples for their rights. IWGIA is a non-profit, non-governmental, politically and ideologically non-aligned organization. IWGIA defends indigenous peoples, descendants of the aboriginal populations of present-day countries. These groups are deprived of rights to territory, resources and a lifestyle in keeping with their culture. IWGIA works to retain the great range of ethnic diversity among the indigenous peoples of the world, while fighting for the actual survival of these communities. In many countries indigenous peoples suffer brutal repression. Massacres of hundreds of people are being carried out by alien armies occupying indigenous territory. IWGIA seeks to bring such atrocities to international attention through its publications. In East Timor, for example, the colonialist oppression of the Indonesian armed forces on an independent people has resulted in the decimation of the indigenous population (IWGIA Documents 40 and 50), while in Guatemala a repressive regime with U.S. backing is carrying out the gradual mass extermination of the indigenous population (IWGIA Document 33 and Documento 1). The endless search for, and the exploitation of, resources by industrialized countries has greatly increased the pressures on indigenous peoples. Sometimes this is undertaken by private companies as has happened in Australia (Document 39) or by national governments themselves embarking on policies of colonizing areas where indigenous peoples have lived for centuries. Brazil is a particularly salient example of this. Many governments disregard the prior claims of indigenous peoples to resources and to self-determination. While many of the problems facing indigenous peoples are caused by specific oppressive governments or political and economic interests, other factors contribute to the difficulties of these groups. Indigenous peoples have human, political and economic rights which frequently run counter to the interests of the international politico-economic system, controlled by industrialized countries, and the principles on which it is based. Economic debt-bondage of Third World nations, international banking organizations and the nuclear arms industry are just some of the major power interests driving indigenous peoples from their lands, depriving them of their basic human rights and freedom of expression. Indigenous peoples are being swallowed up by a system which seeks to develop them and prevent them from exercising their right to develop themselves. Other national and international bodies add to the destruction of indigenous peoples while claiming to help. Large-scale development projects such as dams or production development as well as the work of religious institutions all bear countless economic, political and ideological repercussions for indigenous peoples. On all fronts and in all parts of the world, indigenous peoples are racing destruction from interests, governments and organizations who are eager to impose their ethnocentric view of the world. Even small newly independent countries are no longer able to make truly independent decisions. IWGIA stands opposed to all those bodies which force indigenous peoples to ""develop"" without taking into consideration how these peoples wish to develop themselves. To combat the threats which face them, indigenous peoples have formed organizations and pressure groups. These take many forms throughout the world and strategies for the attainment of basic rights vary considerably. Some indigenous peoples feel that they can fight for their rights better if they come to some form of alliance with political groupings within their country (such as liberation movements, political parties, trade unions or pressure groups) while retaining their indigenous identity. Where indigenous peoples themselves constitute the majority of a country's population, the development of ideologically distinct Indian movements has taken place. The extent to which indigenous organizations are a part of, or separate from, the nation state, varies. At the grassroots level, there is the community which is usually represented on a local or regional level by a federated organization. The broader indigenous organizations put forward the indigenous case on a national level. Many of these have, since 1975, been part of the World Council of Indigenous Peoples which works internationally. Financed by subscription and support from Scandinavian governments, IWGIA fights alongside indigenous peoples for their rights in several ways. IWGIA is a documentation and research organization which publicizes the problems facing indigenous peoples and represents their perceptions and preoccupations. IWGIA is a forum for the ideas and concerns of the indigenous world where native people feel that they have a platform for their opinions. Many of IWGIA's reports and documents are written by scientists and researchers with experience in the field of indigenous affairs. These publications provide insight into the forces and causes behind the oppression of indigenous peoples, providing a critique of the system through which such injustices can arise. IWGIA publishes four issues of an English Newsletter and Spanish Boletín annually. These consist of articles and pieces gathered from indigenous press reports and IWGIA contacts throughout the world. IWGIA also publishes several documents every year. These are more detailed studies of specific problems and areas. There is no region IWGIA is not prepared to cover and the organization welcomes information from anyone concerned for the indigenous cause. IWGIA publications fulfill a multiple role of providing information for indigenous peoples while at the same time informing other organizations and institutions in industrialized nations of the circumstances of indigenous peoples. IWGIA's stance is that information is the most effective armament in the fight for human rights. IWGIA also protests and applies pressure against the blatant violations of indigenous human rights. By sending protest telegrams and news to other organizations, it strives to prevent such oppressions from passing unnoticed. Copies of these protests are published in the Newsletter and Boletines. Another of IWGIA's concerns is the need to support indigenous peoples' self-organization. Whenever it can, IWGIA tries to help indigenous peoples seek funding for small-scale projects, or travel to meetings to put their case to a wider audience. IWGIA not only operates on an international level, in Scandinavia there are several local groups of dedicated, concerned people eager to work for the indigenous cause on a local and national level. They talk in schools, present publications for use in educational institutions and occasionally mount exhibitions on IWGIA or on a particular problem in the indigenous world. They also organize seminars on indigenous affairs within Scandinavia. IWGIA's work covers many areas and its policy reflects the variety of strategies and cultures within the indigenous world. This diversity is framed by the unity of the struggle for basic rights of indigenous peoples. It is the indigenous peoples themselves who should be allowed to determine and control their futures; IWGIA supports this aim, in the hope that indigenous peoples, organizations and communities throughout the world can shape their own destinies.

As of 1 January 2021, the city had a population of 799,033 (638,117 in Copenhagen Municipality, 103,677 in Frederiksberg Municipality, 42,670 in Tårnby Municipality, and 14,569 in Dragør Municipality).[3][7][8] It forms the core of the wider urban area of Copenhagen (population 1,336,982) and the Copenhagen metropolitan area (population 2,057,142). Copenhagen is situated on the eastern coast of the island of Zealand; another portion of the city is located on Amager, and it is separated from Malmö, Sweden, by the strait of Øresund. The Øresund Bridge connects the two cities by rail and road. Originally a Viking fishing village established in the 10th century in the vicinity of what is now Gammel Strand, Copenhagen became the capital of Denmark in the early 15th century. Beginning in the 17th century, it consolidated its position as a regional centre of power with its institutions, defences, and armed forces. During the Renaissance the city served as the de facto capital being the seat of government of the Kalmar Union, governing the entire present day Nordic region in a personal union with Sweden and Norway ruled by the Danish monarch serving as the head of state. The city flourished as the cultural and economic center of Scandinavia under the union for well over 120 years, starting in the 15th century up until the beginning of the 16th century when the union was dissolved with Sweden leaving the union through a rebellion. After a plague outbreak and fire in the 18th century, the city underwent a period of redevelopment. This included construction of the prestigious district of Frederiksstaden and founding of such cultural institutions as the Royal Theatre and the Royal Academy of Fine Arts. After further disasters in the early 19th century when Horatio Nelson attacked the Dano-Norwegian fleet and bombarded the city, rebuilding during the Danish Golden Age brought a Neoclassical look to Copenhagen's architecture. Later, following the Second World War, the Finger Plan fostered the development of housing and businesses along the five urban railway routes stretching out from the city centre. Since the turn of the 21st century, Copenhagen has seen strong urban and cultural development, facilitated by investment in its institutions and infrastructure. The city is the cultural, economic and governmental centre of Denmark; it is one of the major financial centres of Northern Europe with the Copenhagen Stock Exchange. Copenhagen's economy has seen rapid developments in the service sector, especially through initiatives in information technology, pharmaceuticals and clean technology. Since the completion of the Øresund Bridge, Copenhagen has become increasingly integrated with the Swedish province of Scania and its largest city, Malmö, forming the Øresund Region. With a number of bridges connecting the various districts, the cityscape is characterised by parks, promenades, and waterfronts. Copenhagen's landmarks such as Tivoli Gardens, The Little Mermaid statue, the Amalienborg and Christiansborg palaces, Rosenborg Castle, Frederik's Church, Børsen and many museums, restaurants and nightclubs are significant tourist attractions. Copenhagen is home to the University of Copenhagen, the Technical University of Denmark, Copenhagen Business School and the IT University of Copenhagen. The University of Copenhagen, founded in 1479, is the oldest university in Denmark. Copenhagen is home to the F.C. Copenhagen. The annual Copenhagen Marathon was established in 1980. Copenhagen is one of the most bicycle-friendly cities in the world. Movia is the public mass transit company serving all of eastern Denmark, except Bornholm. The Copenhagen Metro, launched in 2002, serves central Copenhagen. Additionally, the Copenhagen S-train, the Lokaltog (private railway), and the Coast Line network serve and connect central Copenhagen to outlying boroughs. Serving roughly 2.5 million passengers a month, Copenhagen Airport, Kastrup, is the busiest airport in the Nordic countries.

The original designation in Old Norse, from which Danish descends, was Kaupmannahǫfn [ˈkaupmanːahɒvn] (cf. modern Icelandic: Kaupmannahöfn [ˈkʰœihpmanːahœpn̥], Faroese Keypmannahavn), meaning ""merchants' harbour"". By the time Old Danish was spoken, the capital was called Køpmannæhafn, with the current name deriving from centuries of subsequent regular sound change. An exact English equivalent would be ""chapman's haven"".[9] The English chapman, German Kaufmann, Dutch koopman, Swedish köpman, Danish købmand, Icelandic kaupmaður share a derivation from Latin caupo, meaning ""tradesman"". However, the English term for the city was adapted from its Low German name, Kopenhagen. Copenhagen's Swedish name is Köpenhamn, a direct translation of the mutually intelligible Danish name. History[edit] Main articles: History of Copenhagen and Timeline of Copenhagen Reconstruction of Copenhagen c. 1500 Early history[edit] Although the earliest historical records of Copenhagen are from the end of the 12th century, recent archaeological finds in connection with work on the city's metropolitan rail system revealed the remains of a large merchant's mansion near today's Kongens Nytorv from c. 1020. Excavations in Pilestræde have also led to the discovery of a well from the late 12th century. The remains of an ancient church, with graves dating to the 11th century, have been unearthed near where Strøget meets Rådhuspladsen. These finds indicate that Copenhagen's origins as a city go back at least to the 11th century. Substantial discoveries of flint tools in the area provide evidence of human settlements dating to the Stone Age.[10] Many historians believe the town dates to the late Viking Age, and was possibly founded by Sweyn I Forkbeard.[11] The natural harbour and good herring stocks seem to have attracted fishermen and merchants to the area on a seasonal basis from the 11th century and more permanently in the 13th century.[12] The first habitations were probably centred on Gammel Strand (literally ""old shore"") in the 11th century or even earlier.[13] The earliest written mention of the town was in the 12th century when Saxo Grammaticus in Gesta Danorum referred to it as Portus Mercatorum, meaning Merchants' Harbour or, in the Danish of the time, Købmannahavn.[14] Traditionally, Copenhagen's founding has been dated to Bishop Absalon's construction of a modest fortress on the little island of Slotsholmen in 1167 where Christiansborg Palace stands today.[15] The construction of the fortress was in response to attacks by Wendish pirates who plagued the coastline during the 12th century.[16] Defensive ramparts and moats were completed and by 1177 St. Clemens Church had been built. Attacks by the Wends continued, and after the original fortress was eventually destroyed by the marauders, islanders replaced it with Copenhagen Castle.[17] Middle Ages[edit] In 1186, a letter from Pope Urban III states that the castle of Hafn (Copenhagen) and its surrounding lands, including the town of Hafn, were given to Absalon, Bishop of Roskilde 1158–1191 and Archbishop of Lund 1177–1201, by King Valdemar I. On Absalon's death, the property was to come into the ownership of the Bishopric of Roskilde.[12] Around 1200, the Church of Our Lady was constructed on higher ground to the northeast of the town, which began to develop around it.[12] As the town became more prominent, it was repeatedly attacked by the Hanseatic League, and in 1368 successfully invaded during the Second Danish-Hanseatic War. As the fishing industry thrived in Copenhagen, particularly in the trade of herring, the city began expanding to the north of Slotsholmen.[16] In 1254, it received a charter as a city under Bishop Jakob Erlandsen[18] who garnered support from the local fishing merchants against the king by granting them special privileges.[19] In the mid 1330s, the first land assessment of the city was published.[19] With the establishment of the Kalmar Union (1397–1523) between Denmark, Norway and Sweden, by about 1416 Copenhagen had emerged as the capital of Denmark when Eric of Pomerania moved his seat to Copenhagen Castle.[20][17] The University of Copenhagen was inaugurated on 1 June 1479 by King Christian I, following approval from Pope Sixtus IV.[21] This makes it the oldest university in Denmark and one of the oldest in Europe. Originally controlled by the Catholic Church, the university's role in society was forced to change during the Reformation in Denmark in the late 1530s.[21] 16th and 17th centuries[edit] The Tøjhus Museum, the former arsenalBørsen, the former stock exchange (completed in 1640) In disputes prior to the Reformation of 1536, the city which had been faithful to Christian II, who was Catholic, was successfully besieged in 1523 by the forces of Frederik I, who supported Lutheranism. Copenhagen's defences were reinforced with a series of towers along the city wall. After an extended siege from July 1535 to July 1536, during which the city supported Christian II's alliance with Malmö and Lübeck, it was finally forced to capitulate to Christian III. During the second half of the century, the city prospered from increased trade across the Baltic supported by Dutch shipping. Christoffer Valkendorff, a high-ranking statesman, defended the city's interests and contributed to its development.[12] The Netherlands had also become primarily Protestant, as were northern German states. During the reign of Christian IV between 1588 and 1648, Copenhagen had dramatic growth as a city. On his initiative at the beginning of the 17th century, two important buildings were completed on Slotsholmen: the Tøjhus Arsenal and Børsen, the stock exchange. To foster international trade, the East India Company was founded in 1616. To the east of the city, inspired by Dutch planning, the king developed the district of Christianshavn with canals and ramparts. It was initially intended to be a fortified trading centre but ultimately became part of Copenhagen.[22] Christian IV also sponsored an array of ambitious building projects including Rosenborg Slot and the Rundetårn.[16] In 1658–59, the city withstood a siege by the Swedes under Charles X and successfully repelled a major assault.[22] By 1661, Copenhagen had asserted its position as capital of Denmark and Norway. All the major institutions were located there, as was the fleet and most of the army. The defences were further enhanced with the completion of the Citadel in 1664 and the extension of Christianshavns Vold with its bastions in 1692, leading to the creation of a new base for the fleet at Nyholm.[22][23] 18th century[edit] A mansion at Amalienborg in Frederiksstaden, part of the Amalienborg Palace Copenhagen lost around 22,000 of its population of 65,000 to the plague in 1711.[24] The city was also struck by two major fires that destroyed much of its infrastructure.[17] The Copenhagen Fire of 1728 was the largest in the history of Copenhagen. It began on the evening of 20 October, and continued to burn until the morning of 23 October, destroying approximately 28% of the city, leaving some 20% of the population homeless. No less than 47% of the medieval section of the city was completely lost. Along with the 1795 fire, it is the main reason that few traces of the old town can be found in the modern city.[25][26] A substantial amount of rebuilding followed. In 1733, work began on the royal residence of Christiansborg Palace which was completed in 1745. In 1749, development of the prestigious district of Frederiksstaden was initiated. Designed by Nicolai Eigtved in the Rococo style, its centre contained the mansions which now form Amalienborg Palace.[27] Major extensions to the naval base of Holmen were undertaken while the city's cultural importance was enhanced with the Royal Theatre and the Royal Academy of Fine Arts.[28] In the second half of the 18th century, Copenhagen benefited from Denmark's neutrality during the wars between Europe's main powers, allowing it to play an important role in trade between the states around the Baltic Sea. After Christiansborg was destroyed by fire in 1794 and another fire caused serious damage to the city in 1795, work began on the classical Copenhagen landmark of Højbro Plads while Nytorv and Gammel Torv were converged.[28] 19th century[edit] On 2 April 1801, a British fleet under the command of Admiral Sir Hyde Parker attacked and defeated the neutral Danish-Norwegian fleet anchored near Copenhagen. Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson led the main attack.[29] He famously disobeyed Parker's order to withdraw, destroying many of the Dano-Norwegian ships before a truce was agreed.[30] Copenhagen is often considered to be Nelson's hardest-fought battle, surpassing even the heavy fighting at Trafalgar.[31] It was during this battle that Lord Nelson was said to have ""put the telescope to the blind eye"" in order not to see Admiral Parker's signal to cease fire.[32] Gottlieb Bindesbøll's Thorvaldsen Museum Danish soldiers returning to Copenhagen in 1849, after the First Schleswig War – painting by Otto Bache (1894) The Second Battle of Copenhagen (or the Bombardment of Copenhagen) (16 August – 5 September 1807) was from a British point of view a preemptive attack on Copenhagen, targeting the civilian population to yet again seize the Dano-Norwegian fleet.[33] But from a Danish point of view, the battle was a terror bombardment on their capital. Particularly notable was the use of incendiary Congreve rockets (containing phosphorus, which cannot be extinguished with water) that randomly hit the city. Few houses with straw roofs remained after the bombardment. The largest church, Vor frue kirke, was destroyed by the sea artillery. Several historians consider this battle the first terror attack against a major European city in modern times.[34][35] Slotsholmen canal, as seen from the Børsen building (c. 1900). In the background from left to right: Church of the Holy Ghost, Trinitatis Complex, St. Nicholas Church and Holmen Church. The British landed 30,000 men, they surrounded Copenhagen and the attack continued for the next three days, killing some 2,000 civilians and destroying most of the city.[36] The devastation was so great because Copenhagen relied on an old defence-line whose limited range could not reach the British ships and their longer-range artillery.[37] Despite the disasters of the early 19th century, Copenhagen experienced a period of intense cultural creativity known as the Danish Golden Age. Painting prospered under C.W. Eckersberg and his students while C.F. Hansen and Gottlieb Bindesbøll brought a Neoclassical look to the city's architecture.[38] In the early 1850s, the ramparts of the city were opened to allow new housing to be built around The Lakes (Danish: Søerne) that bordered the old defences to the west. By the 1880s, the districts of Nørrebro and Vesterbro developed to accommodate those who came from the provinces to participate in the city's industrialization. This dramatic increase of space was long overdue, as not only were the old ramparts out of date as a defence system but bad sanitation in the old city had to be overcome. From 1886, the west rampart (Vestvolden) was flattened, allowing major extensions to the harbour leading to the establishment of the Freeport of Copenhagen 1892–94.[39] Electricity came in 1892 with electric trams in 1897. The spread of housing to areas outside the old ramparts brought about a huge increase in the population. In 1840, Copenhagen was inhabited by approximately 120,000 people. By 1901, it had some 400,000 inhabitants.[28] 20th century[edit] Central Copenhagen in 1939 By the beginning of the 20th century, Copenhagen had become a thriving industrial and administrative city. With its new city hall and railway station, its centre was drawn towards the west.[28] New housing developments grew up in Brønshøj and Valby while Frederiksberg became an enclave within the city of Copenhagen.[40] The northern part of Amager and Valby were also incorporated into the City of Copenhagen in 1901–02.[41] As a result of Denmark's neutrality in the First World War, Copenhagen prospered from trade with both Britain and Germany while the city's defences were kept fully manned by some 40,000 soldiers for the duration of the war.[42] In the 1920s there were serious shortages of goods and housing. Plans were drawn up to demolish the old part of Christianshavn and to get rid of the worst of the city's slum areas.[43] However, it was not until the 1930s that substantial housing developments ensued,[44] with the demolition of one side of Christianhavn's Torvegade to build five large blocks of flats.[43] World War II[edit] See also: Denmark in World War II and Danish resistance movement The RAF's bombing of the Gestapo headquarters in March 1945 was coordinated with the Danish resistance movement. People celebrating the liberation of Denmark at Strøget in Copenhagen, 5 May 1945. Germany surrendered two days later. In Denmark during World War II, Copenhagen was occupied by German troops along with the rest of the country from 9 April 1940 until 4 May 1945. German leader Adolf Hitler hoped that Denmark would be ""a model protectorate""[45] and initially the Nazi authorities sought to arrive at an understanding with the Danish government. The 1943 Danish parliamentary election was also allowed to take place, with only the Communist Party excluded. But in August 1943, after the government's collaboration with the occupation forces collapsed, several ships were sunk in Copenhagen Harbor by the Royal Danish Navy to prevent their use by the Germans. Around that time the Nazis started to arrest Jews, although most managed to escape to Sweden.[46] In 1945 Ole Lippman, leader of the Danish section of the Special Operations Executive, invited the British Royal Air Force to assist their operations by attacking Nazi headquarters in Copenhagen. Accordingly, air vice-marshal Sir Basil Embry drew up plans for a spectacular precision attack on the Sicherheitsdienst and Gestapo building, the former offices of the Shell Oil Company. Political prisoners were kept in the attic to prevent an air raid, so the RAF had to bomb the lower levels of the building.[47] The attack, known as ""Operation Carthage"", came on 22 March 1945, in three small waves. In the first wave, all six planes (carrying one bomb each) hit their target, but one of the aircraft crashed near Frederiksberg Girls School. Because of this crash, four of the planes in the two following waves assumed the school was the military target and aimed their bombs at the school, leading to the death of 123 civilians (of which 87 were schoolchildren).[47] However, 18 of the 26 political prisoners in the Shell Building managed to escape while the Gestapo archives were completely destroyed.[47] On 8 May 1945 Copenhagen was officially liberated by British troops commanded by Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery who supervised the surrender of 30,000 Germans situated around the capital.[48] Post-war decades[edit] Shortly after the end of the war, an innovative urban development project known as the Finger Plan was introduced in 1947, encouraging the creation of new housing and businesses interspersed with large green areas along five ""fingers"" stretching out from the city centre along the S-train routes.[49][50] With the expansion of the welfare state and women entering the work force, schools, nurseries, sports facilities and hospitals were established across the city. As a result of student unrest in the late 1960s, the former Bådsmandsstræde Barracks in Christianshavn was occupied, leading to the establishment of Freetown Christiania in September 1971.[51] Motor traffic in the city grew significantly and in 1972 the trams were replaced by buses. From the 1960s, on the initiative of the young architect Jan Gehl, pedestrian streets and cycle tracks were created in the city centre.[52] Activity in the port of Copenhagen declined with the closure of the Holmen Naval Base. Copenhagen Airport underwent considerable expansion, becoming a hub for the Nordic countries. In the 1990s, large-scale housing developments were realized in the harbour area and in the west of Amager.[44] The national library's Black Diamond building on the waterfront was completed in 1999.[53] Gallery[edit] The Black Diamond Freetown Christiania - entrance Øresund Bridge 21st century[edit] Copenhagen Opera House Since the summer of 2000, Copenhagen and the Swedish city of Malmö have been connected by the Øresund Bridge, which carries rail and road traffic. As a result, Copenhagen has become the centre of a larger metropolitan area spanning both nations. The bridge has brought about considerable changes in the public transport system and has led to the extensive redevelopment of Amager.[51] The city's service and trade sectors have developed while a number of banking and financial institutions have been established. Educational institutions have also gained importance, especially the University of Copenhagen with its 35,000 students.[54] Another important development for the city has been the Copenhagen Metro, the railway system which opened in 2002 with additions until 2007, transporting some 54 million passengers by 2011.[55] On the cultural front, the Copenhagen Opera House, a gift to the city from the shipping magnate Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller on behalf of the A.P. Møller foundation, was completed in 2004.[56] In December 2009 Copenhagen gained international prominence when it hosted the worldwide climate meeting COP15.[57] Geography[edit] Satellite image of Copenhagen The red line shows the approximate extent of the urban area of Copenhagen. Copenhagen metropolitan area. Copenhagen is part of the Øresund Region, which consists of Zealand, Lolland-Falster and Bornholm in Denmark and Scania in Sweden.[58] It is located on the eastern shore of the island of Zealand, partly on the island of Amager and on a number of natural and artificial islets between the two. Copenhagen faces the Øresund to the east, the strait of water that separates Denmark from Sweden, and which connects the North Sea with the Baltic Sea. The Swedish towns of Malmö and Landskrona lie on the Swedish side of the sound directly across from Copenhagen.[59] By road, Copenhagen is 42 kilometres (26 mi) northwest of Malmö, Sweden, 85 kilometres (53 mi) northeast of Næstved, 164 kilometres (102 mi) northeast of Odense, 295 kilometres (183 mi) east of Esbjerg and 188 kilometres (117 mi) southeast of Aarhus by sea and road via Sjællands Odde.[60] The city centre lies in the area originally defined by the old ramparts, which are still referred to as the Fortification Ring (Fæstningsringen) and kept as a partial green band around it.[61] Then come the late-19th- and early-20th-century residential neighbourhoods of Østerbro, Nørrebro, Vesterbro and Amagerbro. The outlying areas of Kongens Enghave, Valby, Vigerslev, Vanløse, Brønshøj, Utterslev and Sundby followed from 1920 to 1960. They consist mainly of residential housing and apartments often enhanced with parks and greenery.[62] Topography[edit] The central area of the city consists of relatively low-lying flat ground formed by moraines from the last ice age while the hilly areas to the north and west frequently rise to 50 m (160 ft) above sea level. The slopes of Valby and Brønshøj reach heights of over 30 m (98 ft), divided by valleys running from the northeast to the southwest. Close to the centre are the Copenhagen lakes of Sortedams Sø, Peblinge Sø and Sankt Jørgens Sø.[62] Copenhagen rests on a subsoil of flint-layered limestone deposited in the Danian period some 60 to 66 million years ago. Some greensand from the Selandian is also present. There are a few faults in the area, the most important of which is the Carlsberg fault which runs northwest to southeast through the centre of the city.[63] During the last ice age, glaciers eroded the surface leaving a layer of moraines up to 15 m (49 ft) thick.[64] Geologically, Copenhagen lies in the northern part of Denmark where the land is rising because of post-glacial rebound. Beaches[edit] Amager Strandpark Kalvebod Bølge – public beach within the city Amager Strandpark, which opened in 2005, is a 2 km (1 mi) long artificial island, with a total of 4.6 km (2.9 mi) of beaches. It is located just 15 minutes by bicycle or a few minutes by metro from the city centre.[65] In Klampenborg, about 10 kilometers from downtown Copenhagen, is Bellevue Beach. It is 700 metres (2,300 ft) long and has both lifeguards and freshwater showers on the beach.[66] The beaches are supplemented by a system of Harbour Baths along the Copenhagen waterfront. The first and most popular of these is located at Islands Brygge and has won international acclaim for its design.[67] Climate[edit] Frederiksberg Palace in winter Copenhagen is in the oceanic climate zone (Köppen: Cfb).[68] Its weather is subject to low-pressure systems from the Atlantic which result in unstable conditions throughout the year. Apart from slightly higher rainfall from July to September, precipitation is moderate. While snowfall occurs mainly from late December to early March, there can also be rain, with average temperatures around the freezing point.[69] June is the sunniest month of the year with an average of about eight hours of sunshine a day. July is the warmest month with an average daytime high of 21 °C. By contrast, the average hours of sunshine are less than two per day in November and only one and a half per day from December to February. In the spring, it gets warmer again with four to six hours of sunshine per day from March to May. February is the driest month of the year.[70] Exceptional weather conditions can bring as much as 50 cm of snow to Copenhagen in a 24-hour period during the winter months[71] while summer temperatures have been known to rise to heights of 33 °C (91 °F).[72] Because of Copenhagen's northern latitude, the number of daylight hours varies considerably between summer and winter. On the summer solstice, the sun rises at 04:26 and sets at 21:58, providing 17 hours 32 minutes of daylight. On the winter solstice, it rises at 08:37 and sets at 15:39 with 7 hours and 1 minute of daylight. There is therefore a difference of 10 hours and 31 minutes in the length of days and nights between the summer and winter solstices.[73] Climate data for Copenhagen, Denmark (1981–2010 normals, extremes 1768–present) Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °C (°F) 11.8(53.2) 15.8(60.4) 20.8(69.4) 26.2(79.2) 28.5(83.3) 32.7(90.9) 33.0(91.4) 33.8(92.8) 29.8(85.6) 23.2(73.8) 17.0(62.6) 12.8(55.0) 33.8(92.8) Average high °C (°F) 3.4(38.1) 3.6(38.5) 6.5(43.7) 11.8(53.2) 16.7(62.1) 19.6(67.3) 22.2(72.0) 21.8(71.2) 17.5(63.5) 12.6(54.7) 7.6(45.7) 4.4(39.9) 12.3(54.1) Daily mean °C (°F) 1.4(34.5) 1.4(34.5) 3.5(38.3) 7.7(45.9) 12.5(54.5) 15.6(60.1) 18.1(64.6) 17.7(63.9) 13.9(57.0) 9.8(49.6) 5.5(41.9) 2.5(36.5) 9.1(48.4) Average low °C (°F) −0.7(30.7) −0.8(30.6) 0.7(33.3) 4.2(39.6) 8.6(47.5) 11.9(53.4) 14.3(57.7) 14.1(57.4) 10.8(51.4) 7.1(44.8) 3.3(37.9) 0.5(32.9) 6.2(43.2) Record low °C (°F) −26.3(−15.3) −20.0(−4.0) −18.5(−1.3) −8.8(16.2) −3.4(25.9) 1.0(33.8) 0.7(33.3) 0.6(33.1) −3.2(26.2) −7.0(19.4) −15.2(4.6) −16.0(3.2) −26.3(−15.3) Average precipitation mm (inches) 53.0(2.09) 36.9(1.45) 42.3(1.67) 35.8(1.41) 47.2(1.86) 63.9(2.52) 60.9(2.40) 67.5(2.66) 61.0(2.40) 63.3(2.49) 56.4(2.22) 57.4(2.26) 645.7(25.42) Average precipitation days (≥ 0.1 mm) 14.9 11.4 13.5 11.5 10.8 12.0 12.4 12.0 13.6 14.5 15.4 15.4 157.4 Average snowy days 5.9 4.4 4.1 1.3 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.2 1.7 3.9 21.4 Average relative humidity (%) 86 84 82 76 72 72 73 75 78 83 84 85 79 Mean monthly sunshine hours 51.5 68.1 119.7 180.9 230.2 213.3 228.1 198.9 141.9 100.9 55.3 40.6 1,629.7 Average ultraviolet index 0 1 2 3 5 6 5 5 3 1 1 0 3 Source: DMI (precipitation days and snowy days 1971–2000, humidity 1961–1990),[74][75][76] Meteo Climat (record highs and lows)[77] and Weather Atlas[78] Administration[edit] Copenhagen City Hall According to Statistics Denmark, the urban area of Copenhagen (Hovedstadsområdet) consists of the municipalities of Copenhagen, Frederiksberg, Albertslund, Brøndby, Gentofte, Gladsaxe, Glostrup, Herlev, Hvidovre, Lyngby-Taarbæk, Rødovre, Tårnby and Vallensbæk as well as parts of Ballerup, Rudersdal and Furesø municipalities, along with the cities of Ishøj and Greve Strand.[4][79] They are located in the Capital Region (Region Hovedstaden). Municipalities are responsible for a wide variety of public services, which include land-use planning, environmental planning, public housing, management and maintenance of local roads, and social security. Municipal administration is also conducted by a mayor, a council, and an executive.[80] Copenhagen Municipality is by far the largest municipality, with the historic city at its core. The seat of Copenhagen's municipal council is the Copenhagen City Hall (Rådhus), which is situated on City Hall Square. The second largest municipality is Frederiksberg, an enclave within Copenhagen Municipality. Copenhagen Municipality is divided into ten districts (bydele):[81] Indre By, Østerbro, Nørrebro, Vesterbro/Kongens Enghave, Valby, Vanløse, Brønshøj-Husum, Bispebjerg, Amager Øst, and Amager Vest. Neighbourhoods of Copenhagen include Slotsholmen, Frederiksstaden, Islands Brygge, Holmen, Christiania, Carlsberg, Sluseholmen, Sydhavn, Amagerbro, Ørestad, Nordhavnen, Bellahøj, Brønshøj, Ryparken, and Vigerslev. Law and order[edit] Most of Denmark's top legal courts and institutions are based in Copenhagen. A modern style court of justice, Hof- og Stadsretten, was introduced in Denmark, specifically for Copenhagen, by Johann Friedrich Struensee in 1771.[82] Now known as the City Court of Copenhagen (Københavns Byret), it is the largest of the 24 city courts in Denmark with jurisdiction over the municipalities of Copenhagen, Dragør and Tårnby. With its 42 judges, it has a Probate Division, an Enforcement Division and a Registration and Notorial Acts Division while bankruptcy is handled by the Maritime and Commercial Court of Copenhagen.[83] Established in 1862, the Maritime and Commercial Court (Sø- og Handelsretten) also hears commercial cases including those relating to trade marks, marketing practices and competition for the whole of Denmark.[84] Denmark's Supreme Court (Højesteret), located in Christiansborg Palace on Prins Jørgens Gård in the centre of Copenhagen, is the country's final court of appeal. Handling civil and criminal cases from the subordinate courts, it has two chambers which each hear all types of cases.[85] The Danish National Police and Copenhagen Police headquarters is situated in the Neoclassical-inspired Politigården building built in 1918–24 under architects Hack Kampmann and Holger Alfred Jacobsen. The building also contains administration, management, emergency department and radio service offices.[86] In their efforts to deal with drugs, the police have noted considerable success in the two special drug consumption rooms opened by the city where addicts can use sterile needles and receive help from nurses if necessary. Use of these rooms does not lead to prosecution; the city treats drug use as a public health issue, not a criminal one.[87] The Copenhagen Fire Department forms the largest municipal fire brigade in Denmark with some 500 fire and ambulance personnel, 150 administration and service workers, and 35 workers in prevention.[88] The brigade began as the Copenhagen Royal Fire Brigade on 9 July 1687 under King Christian V. After the passing of the Copenhagen Fire Act on 18 May 1868, on 1 August 1870 the Copenhagen Fire Brigade became a municipal institution in its own right.[89] The fire department has its headquarters in the Copenhagen Central Fire Station which was designed by Ludvig Fenger in the Historicist style and inaugurated in 1892.[90] Copenhagen Court House at NytorvCopenhagen Police Headquarters on Polititorvet Environmental planning[edit] Main article: Energy in Denmark The European Environment Agency on Kongens Nytorv Copenhagen is recognized as one of the most environmentally friendly cities in the world.[91] As a result of its commitment to high environmental standards, Copenhagen has been praised for its green economy, ranked as the top green city for the second time in the 2014 Global Green Economy Index (GGEI).[92][93] In 2001 a large offshore wind farm was built just off the coast of Copenhagen at Middelgrunden. It produces about 4% of the city's energy.[94] Years of substantial investment in sewage treatment have improved water quality in the harbour to an extent that the inner harbour can be used for swimming with facilities at a number of locations.[95] Middelgrunden offshore wind farm Copenhagen aims to be carbon-neutral by 2025. Commercial and residential buildings are to reduce electricity consumption by 20 percent and 10 percent respectively, and total heat consumption is to fall by 20 percent by 2025. Renewable energy features such as solar panels are becoming increasingly common in the newest buildings in Copenhagen. District heating will be carbon-neutral by 2025, by waste incineration and biomass. New buildings must now be constructed according to Low Energy Class ratings and in 2020 near net-zero energy buildings. By 2025, 75% of trips should be made on foot, by bike, or by using public transit. The city plans that 20–30% of cars will run on electricity or biofuel by 2025. The investment is estimated at $472 million public funds and $4.78 billion private funds.[96] The city's urban planning authorities continue to take full account of these priorities. Special attention is given both to climate issues and efforts to ensure maximum application of low-energy standards. Priorities include sustainable drainage systems,[97] recycling rainwater, green roofs and efficient waste management solutions. In city planning, streets and squares are to be designed to encourage cycling and walking rather than driving.[98] Further, the city administration is working with smart city initiatives to improve how data and technology can be used to implement new solutions that support the transition toward a carbon-neutral economy. These solutions support operations covered by the city administration to improve e.g. public health, district heating, urban mobility and waste management systems. Smart city operations in Copenhagen are maintained by Copenhagen Solutions Lab, the city's official smart-city development unit under the Technical and Environmental Administration.

For statistical purposes, Statistics Denmark considers the City of Copenhagen (Byen København) to consist of the Municipality of Copenhagen plus three adjacent municipalities: Dragør, Frederiksberg, and Tårnby.[7] Their combined population stands at 763,908 (as of December 2016[update]).[8] The Municipality of Copenhagen is by far the most populous in the country and one of the most populous Nordic municipalities with 601,448 inhabitants (as of December 2016[update]).[4] There was a demographic boom in the 1990s and first decades of the 21st century, largely due to immigration to Denmark. According to figures from the first quarter of 2016, approximately 76% of the municipality's population was of Danish descent,[100] defined as having at least one parent who was born in Denmark and has Danish citizenship. Much of the remaining 24% were of a foreign background, defined as immigrants (18%) or descendants of recent immigrants (6%).[100] There are no official statistics on ethnic groups. The adjacent table shows the most common countries of birth of Copenhagen residents. According to Statistics Denmark, Copenhagen's urban area has a larger population of 1,280,371 (as of 1 January 2016[update]).[4] The urban area consists of the municipalities of Copenhagen and Frederiksberg plus 16 of the 20 municipalities of the former counties Copenhagen and Roskilde, though five of them only partially.[79] Metropolitan Copenhagen has a total of 2,016,285 inhabitants (as of 2016[update]).[4] The area of Metropolitan Copenhagen is defined by the Finger Plan.[101] Since the opening of the Øresund Bridge in 2000, commuting between Zealand and Scania in Sweden has increased rapidly, leading to a wider, integrated area. Known as the Øresund Region, it has 4.1 million inhabitants (of whom 2.7 million (August 2021) live in the Danish part of the region).[102] Religion[edit] See also: List of churches in Copenhagen and Religion in Denmark The Church of Our Lady, situated on Frue Plads A majority (56.9%) of those living in Copenhagen are members of the Lutheran Church of Denmark which is 0.6% lower than one year earlier according to 2019 figures.[103] The National Cathedral, the Church of Our Lady, is one of the dozens of churches in Copenhagen. There are also several other Christian communities in the city, of which the largest is Roman Catholic.[104] Foreign migration to Copenhagen, rising over the last three decades, has contributed to increasing religious diversity; the Grand Mosque of Copenhagen, the first in Denmark, opened in 2014.[105] Islam is the second largest religion in Copenhagen, accounting for approximately 10% of the population.[106][107][108] While there are no official statistics, a significant portion of the estimated 175,000–200,000 Muslims in the country live in the Copenhagen urban area, with the highest concentration in Nørrebro and the Vestegnen.[109] There are also some 7,000 Jews in Denmark, most of them in the Copenhagen area where there are several synagogues.[110] There is a long history of Jews in the city, and the first synagogue in Copenhagen was built in 1684.[111] Today, the history of the Jews of Denmark can be explored at the Danish Jewish Museum in Copenhagen. Quality of living[edit] For a number of years, Copenhagen has ranked high in international surveys for its quality of life. Its stable economy together with its education services and level of social safety make it attractive for locals and visitors alike. Although it is one of the world's most expensive cities, it is also one of the most liveable with its public transport, facilities for cyclists and its environmental policies.[112] In elevating Copenhagen to ""most liveable city"" in 2013, Monocle pointed to its open spaces, increasing activity on the streets, city planning in favour of cyclists and pedestrians, and features to encourage inhabitants to enjoy city life with an emphasis on community, culture and cuisine.[113] Other sources have ranked Copenhagen high for its business environment, accessibility, restaurants and environmental planning.[114] However, Copenhagen ranks only 39th for student friendliness in 2012. Despite a top score for quality of living, its scores were low for employer activity and affordability.[115] Economy[edit] Copenhagen is the major economic and financial centre of Denmark. The city's economy is based largely on services and commerce. Statistics for 2010 show that the vast majority of the 350,000 workers in Copenhagen are employed in the service sector, especially transport and communications, trade, and finance, while less than 10,000 work in the manufacturing industries. The public sector workforce is around 110,000, including education and healthcare.[116] From 2006 to 2011, the economy grew by 2.5% in Copenhagen, while it fell by some 4% in the rest of Denmark.[117] In 2017, the wider Capital Region of Denmark had a gross domestic product (GDP) of €120 billion, and the 15th largest GDP per capita of regions in the European Union.[118] The Crystal, headquarters of Nykredit bank Several financial institutions and banks have headquarters in Copenhagen, including Alm. Brand, Danske Bank, Nykredit and Nordea Bank Danmark. The Copenhagen Stock Exchange (CSE) was founded in 1620 and is now owned by Nasdaq, Inc.. Copenhagen is also home to a number of international companies including A.P. Møller-Mærsk, Novo Nordisk, Carlsberg and Novozymes.[119] City authorities have encouraged the development of business clusters in several innovative sectors, which include information technology, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, clean technology and smart city solutions.[120][121] Scandinavian headquarters for the Swiss pharmaceutical company Ferring Pharmaceuticals Life science is a key sector with extensive research and development activities. Medicon Valley is a leading bi-national life sciences cluster in Europe, spanning the Øresund Region. Copenhagen is rich in companies and institutions with a focus on research and development within the field of biotechnology,[122] and the Medicon Valley initiative aims to strengthen this position and to promote cooperation between companies and academia. Many major Danish companies like Novo Nordisk and Lundbeck, both of which are among the 50 largest pharmaceutical and biotech companies in the world, are located in this business cluster.[123] Shipping is another import sector with Maersk, the world's largest shipping company, having their world headquarters in Copenhagen. The city has an industrial harbour, Copenhagen Port. Following decades of stagnation, it has experienced a resurgence since 1990 following a merger with Malmö harbour. Both ports are operated by Copenhagen Malmö Port (CMP). The central location in the Øresund Region allows the ports to act as a hub for freight that is transported onward to the Baltic countries. CMP annually receives about 8,000 ships and handled some 148,000 TEU in 2012.[124] Copenhagen has some of the highest gross wages in the world.[125] High taxes mean that wages are reduced after mandatory deduction. A beneficial researcher scheme with low taxation of foreign specialists has made Denmark an attractive location for foreign labour. It is however also among the most expensive cities in Europe.[126][127] Denmark's Flexicurity model features some of the most flexible hiring and firing legislation in Europe, providing attractive conditions for foreign investment and international companies looking to locate in Copenhagen.[128] In Dansk Industri's 2013 survey of employment factors in the ninety-six municipalities of Denmark, Copenhagen came in first place for educational qualifications and for the development of private companies in recent years, but fell to 86th place in local companies' assessment of the employment climate. The survey revealed considerable dissatisfaction in the level of dialogue companies enjoyed with the municipal authorities.[129] Tourism[edit] See also: Tourism in Denmark Tourism is a major contributor to Copenhagen's economy, attracting visitors due to the city's harbour, cultural attractions and award-winning restaurants. Since 2009, Copenhagen has been one of the fastest growing metropolitan destinations in Europe.[130] Hotel capacity in the city is growing significantly. From 2009 to 2013, it experienced a 42% growth in international bed nights (total number of nights spent by tourists), tallying a rise of nearly 70% for Chinese visitors.[130] The total number of bed nights in the Capital Region surpassed 9 million in 2013, while international bed nights reached 5 million.[130] In 2010, it is estimated that city break tourism contributed to DKK 2 billion in turnover. However, 2010 was an exceptional year for city break tourism and turnover increased with 29% in that one year.[131] 680,000 cruise passengers visited the port in 2015.[132] In 2019 Copenhagen was ranked first among Lonely Planet's top ten cities to visit.[133] Cityscape[edit] The city skyline features many towers and spires. The city's appearance today is shaped by the key role it has played as a regional centre for centuries. Copenhagen has a multitude of districts, each with its distinctive character and representing its own period. Other distinctive features of Copenhagen include the abundance of water, its many parks, and the bicycle paths that line most streets.[134] Architecture[edit] See also: Architecture in Copenhagen and List of buildings in and around Copenhagen Nyhavn is a 17th-century waterfront lined by brightly coloured townhouses.The central square, Amagertorv, dates back to the Middle Ages.Developing skyline of the Ørestad district, located on the outskirts of CopenhagenClassic building in Copenhagen from around the 1890s. Areas like Vesterbro, Nørrebro and Østerbro were developed around 1890. The oldest section of Copenhagen's inner city is often referred to as Middelalderbyen (the medieval city).[135] However, the city's most distinctive district is Frederiksstaden, developed during the reign of Frederick V. It has the Amalienborg Palace at its centre and is dominated by the dome of Frederik's Church (or the Marble Church) and several elegant 18th-century Rococo mansions.[136] The inner city includes Slotsholmen, a little island on which Christiansborg Palace stands and Christianshavn with its canals.[137] Børsen on Slotsholmen and Frederiksborg Palace in Hillerød are prominent examples of the Dutch Renaissance style in Copenhagen. Around the historical city centre lies a band of congenial residential boroughs (Vesterbro, Inner Nørrebro, Inner Østerbro) dating mainly from late 19th century. They were built outside the old ramparts when the city was finally allowed to expand beyond its fortifications.[138] Sometimes referred to as ""the City of Spires"", Copenhagen is known for its horizontal skyline, broken only by the spires and towers of its churches and castles. Most characteristic of all is the Baroque spire of the Church of Our Saviour with its narrowing external spiral stairway that visitors can climb to the top.[139] Other important spires are those of Christiansborg Palace, the City Hall and the former Church of St. Nikolaj that now houses a modern art venue. Not quite so high are the Renaissance spires of Rosenborg Castle and the ""dragon spire"" of Christian IV's former stock exchange, so named because it resembles the intertwined tails of four dragons.[140] Copenhagen is recognised globally as an exemplar of best practice urban planning.[141] Its thriving mixed use city centre is defined by striking contemporary architecture, engaging public spaces and an abundance of human activity. These design outcomes have been deliberately achieved through careful replanning in the second half of the 20th century. Recent years have seen a boom in modern architecture in Copenhagen[142] both for Danish architecture and for works by international architects. For a few hundred years, virtually no foreign architects had worked in Copenhagen, but since the turn of the millennium the city and its immediate surroundings have seen buildings and projects designed by top international architects. British design magazine Monocle named Copenhagen the World's best design city 2008.[143] Copenhagen's urban development in the first half of the 20th century was heavily influenced by industrialisation. After World War II, Copenhagen Municipality adopted Fordism and repurposed its medieval centre to facilitate private automobile infrastructure in response to innovations in transport, trade and communication.[144] Copenhagen's spatial planning in this time frame was characterised by the separation of land uses: an approach which requires residents to travel by car to access facilities of different uses.[145] The boom in urban development and modern architecture has brought some changes to the city's skyline. A political majority has decided to keep the historical centre free of high-rise buildings, but several areas will see or have already seen massive urban development. Ørestad now has seen most of the recent development. Located near Copenhagen Airport, it currently boasts one of the largest malls in Scandinavia and a variety of office and residential buildings as well as the IT University and a high school.[146] Parks, gardens and zoo[edit] Main article: Parks and open spaces in Copenhagen Rosenborg Castle and park in central Copenhagen Copenhagen is a green city with many parks, both large and small. King's Garden (Kongens Have), the garden of Rosenborg Castle, is the oldest and most frequented of them all.[147] It was Christian IV who first developed its landscaping in 1606. Every year it sees more than 2.5 million visitors[148] and in the summer months it is packed with sunbathers, picnickers and ballplayers. It serves as a sculpture garden with both a permanent display and temporary exhibits during the summer months.[147] Also located in the city centre are the Botanical Gardens noted for their large complex of 19th-century greenhouses donated by Carlsberg founder J. C. Jacobsen.[149] Fælledparken at 58 ha (140 acres) is the largest park in Copenhagen.[150] It is popular for sports fixtures and hosts several annual events including a free opera concert at the opening of the opera season, other open-air concerts, carnival and Labour Day celebrations, and the Copenhagen Historic Grand Prix, a race for antique cars. A historical green space in the northeastern part of the city is Kastellet, a well-preserved Renaissance citadel that now serves mainly as a park.[151] Another popular park is the Frederiksberg Gardens, a 32-hectare romantic landscape park. It houses a colony of tame grey herons and other waterfowl.[152] The park offers views of the elephants and the elephant house designed by world-famous British architect Norman Foster of the adjacent Copenhagen Zoo.[153] Langelinie, a park and promenade along the inner Øresund coast, is home to one of Copenhagen's most-visited tourist attractions, the Little Mermaid statue.[154] In Copenhagen, many cemeteries double as parks, though only for the more quiet activities such as sunbathing, reading and meditation. Assistens Cemetery, the burial place of Hans Christian Andersen, is an important green space for the district of Inner Nørrebro and a Copenhagen institution. The lesser known Vestre Kirkegaard is the largest cemetery in Denmark (54 ha (130 acres)) and offers a maze of dense groves, open lawns, winding paths, hedges, overgrown tombs, monuments, tree-lined avenues, lakes and other garden features.[155] It is official municipal policy in Copenhagen that by 2015 all citizens must be able to reach a park or beach on foot in less than 15 minutes.[156] In line with this policy, several new parks, including the innovative Superkilen in the Nørrebro district, have been completed or are under development in areas lacking green spaces.[157] Landmarks by district[edit] Indre By[edit] The historic centre of the city, Indre By or the Inner City, features many of Copenhagen's most popular monuments and attractions. The area known as Frederiksstaden, developed by Frederik V in the second half of the 18th century in the Rococo style, has the four mansions of Amalienborg, the royal residence, and the wide-domed Marble Church at its centre.[158] Directly across the water from Amalienborg, the recently completed Copenhagen Opera stands on the island of Holmen.[159] To the south of Frederiksstaden, the Nyhavn canal is lined with colourful houses from the 17th and 18th centuries, many now with lively restaurants and bars.[160] The canal runs from the harbour front to the spacious square of Kongens Nytorv which was laid out by Christian V in 1670. Important buildings include Charlottenborg Palace, famous for its art exhibitions, the Thott Palace (now the French embassy), the Royal Danish Theatre and the Hotel D'Angleterre, dated to 1755.[161] Other landmarks in Indre By include the parliament building of Christiansborg, the City Hall and Rundetårn, originally an observatory. There are also several museums in the area including Thorvaldsen Museum dedicated to the 18th-century sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen.[162] Closed to traffic since 1964, Strøget, one of the world's oldest and longest pedestrian streets, runs the 3.2 km (2.0 mi) from Rådhuspladsen to Kongens Nytorv. With its speciality shops, cafés, restaurants, and buskers, it is always full of life and includes the old squares of Gammel Torv and Amagertorv, each with a fountain.[163] Rosenborg Castle on Øster Voldgade was built by Christian IV in 1606 as a summer residence in the Renaissance style. It houses the Danish crown jewels and crown regalia, the coronation throne and tapestries illustrating Christian V's victories in the Scanian War.[164] Christianshavn[edit] Christianshavn Canal Christianshavn lies to the southeast of Indre By on the other side of the harbour. The area was developed by Christian IV in the early 17th century. Impressed by the city of Amsterdam, he employed Dutch architects to create canals within its ramparts which are still well preserved today.[22] The canals themselves, branching off the central Christianshavn Canal and lined with house boats and pleasure craft are one of the area's attractions.[165] Another interesting feature is Freetown Christiania, a fairly large area which was initially occupied by squatters during student unrest in 1971. Today it still maintains a measure of autonomy. The inhabitants openly sell drugs on ""Pusher Street"" as well as their arts and crafts. Other buildings of interest in Christianshavn include the Church of Our Saviour with its spiralling steeple and the magnificent Rococo Christian's Church. Once a warehouse, the North Atlantic House now displays culture from Iceland and Greenland and houses the Noma restaurant, known for its Nordic cuisine.[166][167] Vesterbro[edit] Halmtorvet in Vesterbro Vesterbro, to the southwest of Indre By, begins with the Tivoli Gardens, the city's top tourist attraction with its fairground atmosphere, its Pantomime Theatre, its Concert Hall and its many rides and restaurants.[168] The Carlsberg neighbourhood has some interesting vestiges of the old brewery of the same name including the Elephant Gate and the Ny Carlsberg Brewhouse.[169] The Tycho Brahe Planetarium is located on the edge of Skt. Jørgens Sø, one of the Copenhagen lakes.[170] Halmtorvet, the old haymarket behind the Central Station, is an increasingly popular area with its cafés and restaurants. The former cattle market Øksnehallen has been converted into a modern exhibition centre for art and photography.[171] Radisson Blu Royal Hotel, built by Danish architect and designer Arne Jacobsen for the airline Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) between 1956 and 1960 was once the tallest hotel in Denmark with a height of 69.60 m (228.3 ft) and the city's only skyscraper until 1969.[172] Completed in 1908, Det Ny Teater (the New Theatre) located in a passage between Vesterbrogade and Gammel Kongevej has become a popular venue for musicals since its reopening in 1994, attracting the largest audiences in the country.[173] Nørrebro[edit] Dronning Louises Bro leading into Nørrebrogade Nørrebro to the northwest of the city centre has recently developed from a working-class district into a colourful cosmopolitan area with antique shops, non-Danish food stores and restaurants. Much of the activity is centred on Sankt Hans Torv[174] and around Rantzausgade. Copenhagen's historic cemetery, Assistens Kirkegård halfway up Nørrebrogade, is the resting place of many famous figures including Søren Kierkegaard, Niels Bohr, and Hans Christian Andersen but is also used by locals as a park and recreation area.[175] Østerbro[edit] The Gefion Fountain Just north of the city centre, Østerbro is an upper middle-class district with a number of fine mansions, some now serving as embassies.[176] The district stretches from Nørrebro to the waterfront where The Little Mermaid statue can be seen from the promenade known as Langelinie. Inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale, it was created by Edvard Eriksen and unveiled in 1913.[177] Not far from the Little Mermaid, the old Citadel (Kastellet) can be seen. Built by Christian IV, it is one of northern Europe's best preserved fortifications. There is also a windmill in the area.[178] The large Gefion Fountain (Gefionspringvandet) designed by Anders Bundgaard and completed in 1908 stands close to the southeast corner of Kastellet. Its figures illustrate a Nordic legend.[179] Frederiksberg[edit] Frederiksberg Palace Frederiksberg, a separate municipality within the urban area of Copenhagen, lies to the west of Nørrebro and Indre By and north of Vesterbro. Its landmarks include Copenhagen Zoo founded in 1869 with over 250 species from all over the world and Frederiksberg Palace built as a summer residence by Frederick IV who was inspired by Italian architecture. Now a military academy, it overlooks the extensive landscaped Frederiksberg Gardens with its follies, waterfalls, lakes and decorative buildings.[180] The wide tree-lined avenue of Frederiksberg Allé connecting Vesterbrogade with the Frederiksberg Gardens has long been associated with theatres and entertainment. While a number of the earlier theatres are now closed, the Betty Nansen Theatre and Aveny-T are still active.[181] Amagerbro[edit] Amagerbro (also known as Sønderbro) is the district located immediately south-east of Christianshavn at northernmost Amager. The old city moats and their surrounding parks constitute a clear border between these districts. The main street is Amagerbrogade which after the harbour bridge Langebro, is an extension of H. C. Andersens Boulevard and has a number of various stores and shops as well as restaurants and pubs.[182] Amagerbro was built up during the two first decades of the twentieth century and is the city's northernmost block built area with typically 4–7 floors. Further south follows the Sundbyøster and Sundbyvester districts.[183] Other districts[edit] Not far from Copenhagen Airport on the Kastrup coast, The Blue Planet completed in March 2013 now houses the national aquarium. With its 53 aquariums, it is the largest facility of its kind in Scandinavia.[184] Grundtvig's Church, located in the northern suburb of Bispebjerg, was designed by P.V. Jensen Klint and completed in 1940. A rare example of Expressionist church architecture, its striking west façade is reminiscent of a church organ.[185] Culture[edit] Apart from being the national capital, Copenhagen also serves as the cultural hub of Denmark and wider Scandinavia. Since the late 1990s, it has undergone a transformation from a modest Scandinavian capital into a metropolitan city of international appeal in the same league as Barcelona and Amsterdam.[186] This is a result of huge investments in infrastructure and culture as well as the work of successful new Danish architects, designers and chefs.[142][187] Copenhagen Fashion Week, the largest fashion event in Northern Europe, takes place every year in February and August.[188][189] Museums[edit] See also: List of museums in and around Copenhagen Copenhagen has a wide array of museums of international standing. The National Museum, Nationalmuseet, is Denmark's largest museum of archaeology and cultural history, comprising the histories of Danish and foreign cultures alike.[190] Denmark's National Gallery (Statens Museum for Kunst) is the national art museum with collections dating from the 12th century to the present. In addition to Danish painters, artists represented in the collections include Rubens, Rembrandt, Picasso, Braque, Léger, Matisse, Emil Nolde, Olafur Eliasson, Elmgreen and Dragset, Superflex and Jens Haaning.[191] Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek art museum Another important Copenhagen art museum is the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek founded by second generation Carlsberg philanthropist Carl Jacobsen and built around his personal collections. Its main focus is classical Egyptian, Roman and Greek sculptures and antiquities and a collection of Rodin sculptures, the largest outside France. Besides its sculpture collections, the museum also holds a comprehensive collection of paintings of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist painters such as Monet, Renoir, Cézanne, van Gogh and Toulouse-Lautrec as well as works by the Danish Golden Age painters.[192] Louisiana is a Museum of Modern Art situated on the coast just north of Copenhagen. It is located in the middle of a sculpture garden on a cliff overlooking Øresund. Its collection of over 3,000 items includes works by Picasso, Giacometti and Dubuffet.[193] The Danish Design Museum is housed in the 18th-century former Frederiks Hospital and displays Danish design as well as international design and crafts.[194] Other museums include: the Thorvaldsens Museum, dedicated to the oeuvre of romantic Danish sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen who lived and worked in Rome;[195] the Cisternerne museum, an exhibition space for contemporary art, located in former cisterns that come complete with stalactites formed by the changing water levels;[196] and the Ordrupgaard Museum, located just north of Copenhagen, which features 19th-century French and Danish art and is noted for its works by Paul Gauguin.[197] Entertainment and performing arts[edit] The Royal Danish Playhouse (left) and Opera House (background, right) The new Copenhagen Concert Hall opened in January 2009. Designed by Jean Nouvel, it has four halls with the main auditorium seating 1,800 people. It serves as the home of the Danish National Symphony Orchestra and along with the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles is the most expensive concert hall ever built.[198] Another important venue for classical music is the Tivoli Concert Hall located in the Tivoli Gardens.[199] Designed by Henning Larsen, the Copenhagen Opera House (Operaen) opened in 2005. It is among the most modern opera houses in the world.[200] The Royal Danish Theatre also stages opera in addition to its drama productions. It is also home to the Royal Danish Ballet. Founded in 1748 along with the theatre, it is one of the oldest ballet troupes in Europe, and is noted for its Bournonville style of ballet.[201] The Royal Danish Theatre main building Copenhagen has a significant jazz scene that has existed for many years. It developed when a number of American jazz musicians such as Ben Webster, Thad Jones, Richard Boone, Ernie Wilkins, Kenny Drew, Ed Thigpen, Bob Rockwell, Dexter Gordon, and others such as rock guitarist Link Wray came to live in Copenhagen during the 1960s. Every year in early July, Copenhagen's streets, squares, parks as well as cafés and concert halls fill up with big and small jazz concerts during the Copenhagen Jazz Festival. One of Europe's top jazz festivals, the annual event features around 900 concerts at 100 venues with over 200,000 guests from Denmark and around the world.[202] The largest venue for popular music in Copenhagen is Vega in the Vesterbro district. It was chosen as ""best concert venue in Europe"" by international music magazine Live. The venue has three concert halls: the great hall, Store Vega, accommodates audiences of 1,550, the middle hall, Lille Vega, has space for 500 and Ideal Bar Live has a capacity of 250.[203] Every September since 2006, the Festival of Endless Gratitude (FOEG) has taken place in Copenhagen. This festival focuses on indie counterculture, experimental pop music and left field music combined with visual arts exhibitions.[204] For free entertainment one can stroll along Strøget, especially between Nytorv and Højbro Plads, which in the late afternoon and evening is a bit like an impromptu three-ring circus with musicians, magicians, jugglers and other street performers.[205] Literature[edit] Copenhagen's main public library Most of Denmarks's major publishing houses are based in Copenhagen.[206] These include the book publishers Gyldendal and Akademisk Forlag and newspaper publishers Berlingske and Politiken (the latter also publishing books).[207][208] Many of the most important contributors to Danish literature such as Hans Christian Andersen (1805–1875) with his fairy tales, the philosopher Søren Kierkegaard (1813–1855) and playwright Ludvig Holberg (1684–1754) spent much of their lives in Copenhagen. Novels set in Copenhagen include Baby (1973) by Kirsten Thorup, The Copenhagen Connection (1982) by Barbara Mertz, Number the Stars (1989) by Lois Lowry, Miss Smilla's Feeling for Snow (1992) and Borderliners (1993) by Peter Høeg, Music and Silence (1999) by Rose Tremain, The Danish Girl (2000) by David Ebershoff, and Sharpe's Prey (2001) by Bernard Cornwell. Michael Frayn's 1998 play Copenhagen about the meeting between the physicists Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg in 1941 is also set in the city. On 15–18 August 1973, an oral literature conference took place in Copenhagen as part of the 9th International Congress of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences.[209] The Royal Library, belonging to the University of Copenhagen, is the largest library in the Nordic countries with an almost complete collection of all printed Danish books since 1482. Founded in 1648, the Royal Library is located at four sites in the city, the main one being on the Slotsholmen waterfront.[210] Copenhagen's public library network has over 20 outlets, the largest being the Central Library (Københavns Hovedbibliotek) on Krystalgade in the inner city.[211] Art[edit] Interior of the National Gallery (Statens Museum for Kunst), combining new and old architecture Copenhagen has a wide selection of art museums and galleries displaying both historic works and more modern contributions. They include Statens Museum for Kunst, i.e. the Danish national art gallery, in the Østre Anlæg park, and the adjacent Hirschsprung Collection specialising in the 19th and early 20th century. Kunsthal Charlottenborg in the city centre exhibits national and international contemporary art. Den Frie Udstilling near the Østerport Station exhibits paintings created and selected by contemporary artists themselves rather than by the official authorities. The Arken Museum of Modern Art is located in southwestern Ishøj.[212] Among artists who have painted scenes of Copenhagen are Martinus Rørbye (1803–1848),[213] Christen Købke (1810–1848)[214] and the prolific Paul Gustav Fischer (1860–1934).[215] A number of notable sculptures can be seen in the city. In addition to The Little Mermaid on the waterfront, there are two historic equestrian statues in the city centre: Jacques Saly's Frederik V on Horseback (1771) in Amalienborg Square[216] and the statue of Christian V on Kongens Nytorv created by Abraham-César Lamoureux in 1688 who was inspired by the statue of Louis XIII in Paris.[217] Rosenborg Castle Gardens contains several sculptures and monuments including August Saabye's Hans Christian Andersen, Aksel Hansen's Echo, and Vilhelm Bissen's Dowager Queen Caroline Amalie.[218] Copenhagen is believed to have invented the photomarathon photography competition, which has been held in the City each year since 1989.[219][220] Cuisine[edit] For a broader look at this topic, see Danish cuisine. Noma is an example of Copenhagen's renowned experimental restaurants, and has gained two Michelin stars. As of 2014[update], Copenhagen has 15 Michelin-starred restaurants, the most of any Scandinavian city.[221] The city is increasingly recognized internationally as a gourmet destination.[222] These include Den Røde Cottage, Formel B Restaurant, Grønbech & Churchill, Søllerød Kro, Kadeau, Kiin Kiin (Denmark's first Michelin-starred Asian gourmet restaurant), the French restaurant Kong Hans Kælder, Relæ, Restaurant AOC, Noma (short for Danish: nordisk mad, English: Nordic food) with two Stars and Geranium with three. Noma, was ranked as the Best Restaurant in the World by Restaurant in 2010, 2011, 2012, and again in 2014,[223] sparking interest in the New Nordic Cuisine.[224] Apart from the selection of upmarket restaurants, Copenhagen offers a great variety of Danish, ethnic and experimental restaurants. It is possible to find modest eateries serving open sandwiches, known as smørrebrød – a traditional, Danish lunch dish; however, most restaurants serve international dishes.[225] Danish pastry can be sampled from any of numerous bakeries found in all parts of the city. The Copenhagen Baker's Association dates back to the 1290s and Denmark's oldest confectioner's shop still operating, Conditori La Glace, was founded in 1870 in Skoubogade by Nicolaus Henningsen, a trained master baker from Flensburg.[226] Copenhagen has long been associated with beer. Carlsberg beer has been brewed at the brewery's premises on the border between the Vesterbro and Valby districts since 1847 and has long been almost synonymous with Danish beer production. However, recent years have seen an explosive growth in the number of microbreweries so that Denmark today has more than 100 breweries, many of which are located in Copenhagen. Some like Nørrebro Bryghus also act as brewpubs where it is also possible to eat on the premises.[227][228] Nightlife and festivals[edit] Copenhagen Pride Parade, 2008 Copenhagen has one of the highest number of restaurants and bars per capita in the world.[229] The nightclubs and bars stay open until 5 or 6 in the morning, some even longer. Denmark has a very liberal alcohol culture and a strong tradition for beer breweries, although binge drinking is frowned upon and the Danish Police take driving under the influence very seriously.[230] Inner city areas such as Istedgade and Enghave Plads in Vesterbro, Sankt Hans Torv in Nørrebro and certain places in Frederiksberg are especially noted for their nightlife. Notable nightclubs include Bakken Kbh, ARCH (previously ZEN), Jolene, The Jane, Chateau Motel, KB3, At Dolores (previously Sunday Club), Rust, Vega Nightclub, Culture Box and Gefährlich, which also serves as a bar, café, restaurant, and art gallery.[231][232] Copenhagen has several recurring community festivals, mainly in the summer. Copenhagen Carnival has taken place every year since 1982 during the Whitsun Holiday in Fælledparken and around the city with the participation of 120 bands, 2,000 dancers and 100,000 spectators.[233] Since 2010, the old B&W Shipyard at Refshaleøen in the harbour has been the location for Copenhell, a heavy metal rock music festival. Copenhagen Pride is a gay pride festival taking place every year in August. The Pride has a series of different activities all over Copenhagen, but it is at the City Hall Square that most of the celebration takes place. During the Pride the square is renamed Pride Square.[234] Copenhagen Distortion has emerged to be one of the biggest street festivals in Europe with 100,000 people joining to parties in the beginning of June every year. Amusement parks[edit] The Pantomime Theatre, opened in 1874, is the oldest building in the Tivoli Gardens. Copenhagen has the two oldest amusement parks in the world.[235][236] Dyrehavsbakken, a fair-ground and pleasure-park established in 1583, is located in Klampenborg just north of Copenhagen in a forested area known as Dyrehaven. Created as an amusement park complete with rides, games and restaurants by Christian IV, it is the oldest surviving amusement park in the world.[235] Pierrot (Danish: Pjerrot), a nitwit dressed in white with a scarlet grin wearing a boat-like hat while entertaining children, remains one of the park's key attractions. In Danish, Dyrehavsbakken is often abbreviated as Bakken. There is no entrance fee to pay and Klampenborg Station on the C-line, is situated nearby.[237] The Tivoli Gardens is an amusement park and pleasure garden located in central Copenhagen between the City Hall Square and the Central Station. It opened in 1843, making it the second oldest amusement park in the world. Among its rides are the oldest still operating rollercoaster Rutschebanen from 1915 and the oldest ferris wheel still in use, opened in 1943.[238] Tivoli Gardens also serves as a venue for various performing arts and as an active part of the cultural scene in Copenhagen.[239] Education[edit] The main building of the University of Copenhagen Copenhagen has over 94,000 students enrolled in its largest universities and institutions: University of Copenhagen (38,867 students),[240] Copenhagen Business School (19,999 students),[241] Metropolitan University College and University College Capital (10,000 students each),[242] Technical University of Denmark (7,000 students),[243] KEA (c. 4,500 students),[244] IT University of Copenhagen (2,000 students) and Aalborg University – Copenhagen (2,300 students).[245] The University of Copenhagen is Denmark's oldest university founded in 1479. It attracts some 1,500 international and exchange students every year. The Academic Ranking of World Universities placed it 30th in the world in 2016.[246] The Technical University of Denmark is located in Lyngby in the northern outskirts of Copenhagen. In 2013, it was ranked as one of the leading technical universities in Northern Europe.[247] The IT University is Denmark's youngest university, a mono-faculty institution focusing on technical, societal and business aspects of information technology.[248] The Danish Academy of Fine Arts has provided education in the arts for more than 250 years. It includes the historic School of Visual Arts, and has in later years come to include a School of Architecture, a School of Design and a School of Conservation.[249] Copenhagen Business School (CBS) is an EQUIS-accredited business school located in Frederiksberg.[250] There are also branches of both University College Capital and Metropolitan University College inside and outside Copenhagen.[251][252] Sport[edit] The city has a variety of sporting teams. The major football teams are the historically successful FC København[253] and Brøndby. FC København plays at Parken in Østerbro. Formed in 1992, it is a merger of two older Copenhagen clubs, B 1903 (from the inner suburb Gentofte) and KB (from Frederiksberg).[254] Brøndby plays at Brøndby Stadion in the inner suburb of Brøndbyvester. BK Frem is based in the southern part of Copenhagen (Sydhavnen, Valby). Other teams are FC Nordsjælland (from suburban Farum), Fremad Amager, B93, AB, Lyngby and Hvidovre IF.[255] Copenhagen Marathon, 2008 Copenhagen has several handball teams—a sport which is particularly popular in Denmark. Of clubs playing in the ""highest"" leagues, there are Ajax, Ydun, and HIK (Hellerup).[255] The København Håndbold women's club has recently been established.[256] Copenhagen also has ice hockey teams, of which three play in the top league, Rødovre Mighty Bulls, Herlev Eagles and Hvidovre Ligahockey all inner suburban clubs. Copenhagen Ice Skating Club founded in 1869 is the oldest ice hockey team in Denmark but is no longer in the top league.[257] Rugby union is also played in the Danish capital with teams such as CSR-Nanok, Copenhagen Business School Sport Rugby, Frederiksberg RK, Exiles RUFC and Rugbyklubben Speed. Rugby league is now played in Copenhagen, with the national team playing out of Gentofte Stadion. The Danish Australian Football League, based in Copenhagen is the largest Australian rules football competition outside of the English-speaking world.[255][258] Copenhagen Marathon, Copenhagen's annual marathon event, was established in 1980.[259] Round Christiansborg Open Water Swim Race is a 2-kilometre (1.2-mile) open water swimming competition taking place each year in late August.[260] This amateur event is combined with a 10-kilometre (6-mile) Danish championship.[261] In 2009 the event included a 10-kilometre (6-mile) FINA World Cup competition in the morning. Copenhagen hosted the 2011 UCI Road World Championships in September 2011, taking advantage of its bicycle-friendly infrastructure. It was the first time that Denmark had hosted the event since 1956, when it was also held in Copenhagen.[262] Transport[edit] Main article: Transport in Copenhagen Aerial view of Copenhagen seen from an airplane departing from Copenhagen Airport Map of the city's rail networks. The ""City Pass"" area. S-trains, Metro and Regional trains. The lines are not shown, but the Metro, S-Trains and Regional trains, together. They all use the same ticket system. Airport[edit] The greater Copenhagen area has a very well established transportation infrastructure making it a hub in Northern Europe. Copenhagen Airport, opened in 1925, is Scandinavia's largest airport, located in Kastrup on the island of Amager. It is connected to the city centre by metro and main line railway services.[263] October 2013 was a record month with 2.2 million passengers, and November 2013 figures reveal that the number of passengers is increasing by some 3% annually, about 50% more than the European average.[264] Road, rail and ferry[edit] Copenhagen has an extensive road network including motorways connecting the city to other parts of Denmark and to Sweden over the Øresund Bridge.[265] The car is still the most popular form of transport within the city itself, representing two-thirds of all distances travelled. This can however lead to serious congestion in rush hour traffic.[266] The Øresund train links Copenhagen with Malmö 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Copenhagen is also served by a daily ferry connection to Oslo in Norway.[267] In 2012, Copenhagen Harbour handled 372 cruise ships and 840,000 passengers.[267] The Copenhagen S-Train, Copenhagen Metro and the regional train networks are used by about half of the city's passengers, the remainder using bus services. Nørreport Station near the city centre serves passengers travelling by main-line rail, S-train, regional train, metro and bus. Some 750,000 passengers make use of public transport facilities every day.[265] Copenhagen Central Station is the hub of the DSB railway network serving Denmark and international destinations.[268] The Copenhagen Metro expanded radically with the opening of the City Circle Line (M3) on September 29, 2019.[269] The new line connects all inner boroughs of the city by metro, including the Central Station, and opens up 17 new stations[270] for Copenhageners. On March 28, 2020, the 2.2 km (1.4 mi) Nordhavn extension of the Harbour Line (M4) opened.[271] Running from Copenhagen Central Station, the new extension is a branch line of M3 Cityring to Osterport.[272] The M4 Sydhavn branch is expected to open in 2024.[273] The new metro lines are part of the city's strategy to transform mobility towards sustainable modes of transport such as public transport and cycling as opposed to automobility.[274] Copenhagen is cited by urban planners for its exemplary integration of public transport and urban development. In implementing its Finger Plan, Copenhagen is considered the world's first example of a transit metropolis,[50] and areas around S-Train stations like Ballerup and Brøndby Strand are among the earliest examples of transit-oriented development. Cycling[edit] Main article: Cycling in Copenhagen See also: Cycling advocacy § Copenhagenization The intense use of bicycles in Copenhagen illustrated here at the Christianshavn Metro Station. Copenhagen has been rated as the most bicycle-friendly city in the world since 2015, with bicycles outnumbering its inhabitants.[275][276][277] In 2012 some 36% of all working or studying city-dwellers cycled to work, school, or university. With 1.27 million km covered every working day by Copenhagen's cyclists (including both residents and commuters), and 75% of Copenhageners cycling throughout the year.[278] The city's bicycle paths are extensive and well used, boasting 400 kilometres (250 miles) of cycle lanes not shared with cars or pedestrians, and sometimes have their own signal systems – giving the cyclists a lead of a couple of seconds to accelerate.[277][279] Healthcare[edit] See also: Healthcare in Denmark Rigshospitalet is one of the largest hospitals in Denmark. Promoting health is an important issue for Copenhagen's municipal authorities. Central to its sustainability mission is its ""Long Live Copenhagen"" (Længe Leve København) scheme in which it has the goal of increasing the life expectancy of citizens, improving quality of life through better standards of health, and encouraging more productive lives and equal opportunities.[280] The city has targets to encourage people to exercise regularly and to reduce the number who smoke and consume alcohol.[280] Copenhagen University Hospital forms a conglomerate of several hospitals in Region Hovedstaden and Region Sjælland, together with the faculty of health sciences at the University of Copenhagen; Rigshospitalet and Bispebjerg Hospital in Copenhagen belong to this group of university hospitals.[281] Rigshospitalet began operating in March 1757 as Frederiks Hospital,[282] and became state-owned in 1903. With 1,120 beds, Rigshospitalet has responsibility for 65,000 inpatients and approximately 420,000 outpatients annually. It seeks to be the number one specialist hospital in the country, with an extensive team of researchers into cancer treatment, surgery and radiotherapy.[283] In addition to its 8,000 personnel, the hospital has training and hosting functions. It benefits from the presence of in-service students of medicine and other healthcare sciences, as well as scientists working under a variety of research grants. The hospital became internationally famous as the location of Lars von Trier's television horror mini-series The Kingdom. Bispebjerg Hospital was built in 1913, and serves about 400,000 people in the Greater Copenhagen area, with some 3,000 employees.[284] Other large hospitals in the city include Amager Hospital (1997),[285] Herlev Hospital (1976),[286] Hvidovre Hospital (1970),[287] and Gentofte Hospital (1927).[288] Media[edit] The Aller Media conglomerate building in Havneholm Many Danish media corporations are located in Copenhagen. DR, the major Danish public service broadcasting corporation consolidated its activities in a new headquarters, DR Byen, in 2006 and 2007. Similarly TV2, which is based in Odense, has concentrated its Copenhagen activities in a modern media house in Teglholmen.[289] The two national daily newspapers Politiken and Berlingske and the two tabloids Ekstra Bladet and BT are based in Copenhagen.[290] Kristeligt Dagblad is based in Copenhagen and is published six days a week.[291] Other important media corporations include Aller Media which is the largest publisher of weekly and monthly magazines in Scandinavia,[292] the Egmont media group[293] and Gyldendal, the largest Danish publisher of books.[294] Copenhagen has a large film and television industry. Nordisk Film, established in Valby, Copenhagen in 1906 is the oldest continuously operating film production company in the world.[233] In 1992 it merged with the Egmont media group and currently runs the 17-screen Palads Cinema in Copenhagen. Filmbyen (movie city), located in a former military camp in the suburb of Hvidovre, houses several movie companies and studios. Zentropa is a film company, co-owned by Danish director Lars von Trier. He is behind several international movie productions as well and founded the Dogme Movement.[295] CPH:PIX is Copenhagen's international feature film festival, established in 2009 as a fusion of the 20-year-old NatFilm Festival and the four-year-old CIFF. The CPH:PIX festival takes place in mid-April. CPH:DOX is Copenhagen's international documentary film festival, every year in November. In addition to a documentary film programme of over 100 films, CPH:DOX includes a wide event programme with dozens of events, concerts, exhibitions and parties all over town.[296] Twin towns – sister cities[edit] See also: List of twin towns and sister cities in Denmark Copenhagen is twinned with: Beijing, China[297] Marseille, France[298] Honorary citizens[edit] People awarded the honorary citizenship of Copenhagen are: Date Name Notes 21 November 1838 Bertel Thorvaldsen (1770–1844) Danish sculptor[299] While honorary citizenship is no longer granted in Copenhagen, three people have been awarded the title of honorary Copenhageners (æreskøbenhavnere).

Prior to 2013, it was a quarterly publication that included a special Year in Review issue, which is now a separate annual publication known as The Year in Review.  The ABA published the inaugural issue of The International Lawyer in 1966, and SMU has been the proud home of this prestigious journal since 1986. Since then, The International Lawyer has grown to become the most widely distributed U.S. international law review in the world, enjoying subscriptions of approximately 11,000 readers in more than 90 countries.  In an effort to satisfy its worldwide readership, this publication focuses primarily on practical issues of international law, including trade, licensing, direct investment, finance, taxation, litigation, and dispute resolution. To help produce The International Lawyer, SMU’s student editorial board works in conjunction with the professional editorial board chaired by the Editor-in-Chief, Marc I. Steinberg, Rupert and Lillian Radford Professor of Law, SMU Dedman School of Law.  Patricia S. Heard and Beverly C. Duréus, also of the SMU Law School, serve as Co-Executive Editors.

Government attempts to obtain access or receive information, as well as the responses of the private sector to such attempts, raise complex legal issues, depending on the specific socio-political context and the domestic legal traditions. The LPD set up the Task Force on Government Access to IT Systems in October 2017. This report provides the Task Force’s assessment based on the considerations of this topic in different jurisdictions and offers a set of working principles for balancing government access to IT systems and fundamental rights. Read report from the IBA Legal Practice Division, September 2019 Further information Digital Identity Working Group Project The pervasive use of new modes of communication and transaction of business, for personal and professional purposes, is creating information relating to users that encompasses a wide variety of areas - a digital identity. This IBA Legal Practice Division Working Group has undertaken to develop a set of high-level Principles around the collection, use and sharing of digital identity information that could serve as the basis for engaging in dialogue with all relevant stakeholders. If you have any comments or questions about the project or report, contact anurag.bana@int-bar.org. Digital Identity: principles on collection and use of information report, April 2016 Business Law International (BLI) Published three time a year by the IBA’s Legal Practice Division, Business Law International covers the latest developments in all areas of business law across the globe, from M&A to employment, competition to tax, offering rigorous comparative analysis of how the law affects business in different jurisdictions and across borders. Further information Members are invited to submit ideas for future issues of the journal. Please contact the editor at: editor@int-bar.org The IBA organises over fifty specialist and regional conferences each year in addition to the Annual Conference and the costs involved are very considerable. In order to contain those costs, the IBA through the guidelines set out in the division handbooks has established well defined rules that must be followed so as to ensure that there is conformity in determining to what costs the IBA may be exposed in relation to any particular event. The rules are detailed and deal with many issues including registration fee waivers, speakers’ expenses and entertainment costs. The rules have served the IBA well in the past and are appropriate for the future. The LPD is committed to ensure the highest quality of programmes and calibre of speakers at the sessions that it promotes. There is concern amongst the LPD officers that the current policies sometimes stand in the way of putting on the highest quality sessions. A relaxation of the rules is desirable from time to time to enable certain costs to be paid that are likely to lead to enrichment of the quality of a programme. It is clear that it may sometimes be advantageous to pay certain costs outside the guidelines; for example to a world business leader, regulator, to some academics or NGO representatives, if it can be demonstrated that such a payment is likely to enrich the programme and increase the quality of the relevant session. The LPD officers, the IBA President and the Executive Director recommend the creation of a fund to cover on an exceptional basis, expenses and other matters related to LPD sessions which are not permitted by the guidelines set out in the LPD Handbook. The fund shall cover exceptional expenses to secure speakers as well as expenses incurred by speakers and organisers of sessions at the LPD specialist and regional conferences and LPD sessions at the Annual Conferences. An application to the Fund shall be made by an officer of the relevant LPD committee to the IBA Treasurer, who in consultation with the other LPD officers, shall have absolute discretion to agree to pay part of or the entire sum sought or to decline the application.

Introduction At present, through its collective members (bars, federations, and associations) and individual members, the Union Internationale de Avocats (UIA) brings together two million lawyers from 110 countries. The UIA is the only major multi-lingual and multi-cultural international lawyers’ organization. The UIA is open to all the world’s lawyers, both general practitioners and specialists. The UIA's members have extensive legal expertise, which is reflected in high-level legal debates within its technical commissions and working groups, as well as in resolutions adopted regarding current problems faced by the legal profession throughout the world. To promote professional excellence, the UIA offers seminars, training sessions and other events throughout the year around the world, which qualify for Continuing Legal Education (CLE) purposes. The UIA is committed to defending the cause of lawyers who may be pressured or threatened anywhere in the world, through its lobbying and advocacy activities, and speaks out against forces contrary to the proper functioning of the justice system and legally instituted bar associations. Enjoying special consultative status with the United Nations and participative statut with Council of Europe since 1971, in its capacity as a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO), the UIA is represented at the main United Nations offices (New York, Geneva and Vienna). The UIA conducts its missions in a collegial atmosphere that favours friendship and good relationships between members. Bringing Together the World's Lawyers Activities As a global and multi-cultural organization, the UIA facilitates both professional development and the international exchange of information and ideas, promotes the Rule of Law, defends the independence and freedom of lawyers and legal institutions worldwide, and emphasizes friendship, collegiality, and networking among members. In all its missions, the UIA pays particular attention to the promotion and preservation of the basic principles of the legal profession, and notably, the independence and freedom lawyers need to practice their profession. Technical activities The UIA offers seminars, training courses, and many other events throughout the year in interesting venues which qualify for Continuing Legal Education (CLE) and give rise to high-level legal debates. Defense of the Rule of Law The UIA created the Institute for the Rule of Law (UIA-IROL) to promote the Rule of Law and address essential human rights issues. Therefore, the UIA-IROL coordinates several UIA bodies: Human Rights and Protection of Lawyers Rule of Law, including Death Penalty Independence of the Profession International Criminal Justice (through the UIA International Criminal Justice Commission) Business & Human Rights (through the UIA Business & Human Rights Commission) Annual Report rapport_annuel_19.png Read UIA Annual Report Download UIA Annual Report Download UIA Annual Report Background At the end of the 19th century, most European lawyers worked within autonomous and independent bar associations, each with their own customs. After World War I, European lawyers gradually realized the importance of helping certain bar associations modernise and build international relationships. In July 1925, lawyers from Belgium, France and Luxembourg initiated the 'Union Internationale des Avocats' project, which came to fruition after two years of collaboration on July 8, 1927 in Charleroi, Belgium. The President of the Paris Bar Association, Georges Guillaumin, served as the Association’s first President. Once the UIA was formed, several bar associations sought membership. After joining the Association, each new bar contributed unique efforts towards the UIA's dual objectives: adapting older bars to the new economic and international climate, and working with the League of Nations to establish lasting peace. In 1930, the UIA adopted the motto 'Omnia Fraternae' at the suggestion of Mr. Gheude, Secretary General of the Belgian Lawyers Federation, during the second Congress held in Paris. In 1933, in Dubrovnik, Mr. Destrée, an influential Belgian lawyer, ended his speech at the 5th UIA Congress by saying, 'Our Association stands as an example. To dispel the problems we are facing, it will be necessary to assert more and more strongly, in all countries, the desire and will to re-establish prosperity in a climate of order and peace. Unity is called for, everywhere. We must unite or perish'. Structure The UIA’s three main bodies are the General Assembly, the Executive Committee, and the Governing Board. These bodies determine UIA’s goals to adopt the rules that govern it and ensure compliance with the UIA’s principles. Presidency The UIA President for 2020-2021 is Jorge Martí Moreno. Valencia, Spain jmm-3-portrait.jpg The term of office of the president runs over one year from congress to congress. UIA Presidents since 1928 UIA Presidents since 1928 Executive Committee The Executive Committee is the UIA’s executive body. It supervises the implementation of the decisions made by the General Assembly and Governing Board and ensures the smooth running of the association. The Executive Committee is elected by the General Assembly. Governing Board The Governing Board is responsible for defining the UIA’s strategy vectors. The Board approves the association’s budget, establishes its operating regulations, and passes resolutions. General Assembly The General Assembly is the UIA’s sovereign body. All UIA members who are up-to-date with the payment of their dues may attend the General Assembly. All collective and individual members who are present or represented at a General Assembly are entitled to vote. This assembly is held at least once a year. National representatives The UIA is represented throughout the world by the Presidents of National Committees, as well as by National Representatives and Regional Secretaries. Their responsibility is to expand the UIA’s presence in their country or region and to serve as the liason between the members in their area and the UIA. Members The UIA has five membership categories: Individual members - Lawyers whose primary professional activity is the practice of law. Collective members - Bars, lawyers’ associations and federations. Associate individual members - Other legal professionals who practice law as their primary occupation, such as law professors and magistrates. Associate collective members - Both national and international associations of legal professionals, as well as international lawyers’ associations with broadly representative membership. Honorary members - Upon recommendation by the Executive Committee, an honor representing an individual's contribution to the UIA's growth and influence as conferred by the General Assembly. UIA Headquarters The UIA headquarters provide multi-lingual administrative and logistics support in all areas of the association’s work.

The organization holds Consultative Status II at the United Nations Economic and Social Council and is a Permanent Participant at the Arctic Council. To thrive in their Circumpolar homeland, Inuit had the vision to realize they must speak with a united voice on issues of common concern and combine their energies and talents towards protecting and promoting their way of life. The principal goals of ICC are, therefore, to Strengthen unity among Inuit of the circumpolar region; Promote Inuit rights and interests on an international level; Develop and encourage long-term policies that safeguard the Arctic environment; and Seek full and active partnership in the political, economic, and social development of circumpolar regions. ICC holds a General Assembly every four years at which Inuit delegates from across the Circumpolar region elect a new Chair and an Executive Council, develop policies, and adopt resolutions that will guide the activities of the organization for the coming term. The General Assembly is the heart of the organization, providing an opportunity for sharing information, discussing common concerns, debating issues, and strengthening the bonds between all Inuit. The ICC international office is housed with the Chair and each member country maintains a national office under the political guidance of a President. In 2017, ICC celebrated its 40th anniversary and produced a short video reflecting on and celebrating the 40 years history of the organization. Click here to view the video.History and Beginnings of the OrganizationIn 1973, several Greenlandic organizations based in Copenhagen hosted the first Arctic Peoples Conference. They invited members of the then Inuit Tapirisat of Canada (now known as Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami), the National Indian Brotherhood of Canada, and Saami from northern Finland, Norway and Sweden. Because neither Alaskan nor Russian Inuit were able to attend that event, the need for Inuit to meet as one indivisible people became clearly evident at that meeting. Inuit visionaries such as Mayor Eben Hopson of the North Slope Borough, Alaska, were among those that never let go of the idea. When, in 1975, the World Council of Indigenous Peoples held its founding conference in Port Alberni, British Columbia, he had his special assistant, Billy Neakoq, deliver an invitation to a pan-Eskimo gathering to be held some time in the near future. Planning, fundraising, and focused attention to this goal began in earnest. A grant submission made to an American foundation in 1975 contains the following statements: We Eskimo are an international community sharing common language, culture, and a common land along the Arctic coast of Siberia, Alaska, Canada and Greenland. Although not a nation-state, as a people, we do constitute a nation. Inuit from Canada, Greenland, and Alaska discussed their common vision when Eben Hopson hosted the first ever the Inuit Circumpolar Conference in June of 1977. At that historic and celebratory meeting, political resolutions were passed, poetry was read, and songs were sung. All 54 delegates (18 from each country) agreed to found an organization to carry on the task of working together on an international basis. The celebratory mood in 1977 was only dampened by the absence of Inuit from the former Soviet Union, whose arrival would have to wait several years.

Contents 1 Early life and education 2 Career 3 Awards 4 References 5 External links Early life and education[edit] Darlene ""Dalee"" Sambo was born in Alaska in 1959.[1] Her parents were raised in Unalakleet, an Inuit village, but she grew up in Anchorage.[2] She was interested in issues affecting Alaska Natives from an early age, recognizing the problems with the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act while in junior high.[3] While attending high school, Dorough organized an independent study working on the 1976 campaign of Inuit politician Eben Hopson for U.S. House of Representatives.[2] Hopson founded the Inuit Circumpolar Council (ICC) in 1977, and Dorough began her volunteer work with the new organization at its first meeting, while she was still in high school.[4] Before accepting her high school diploma, she completed the American Indian Lawyer Training Program in San Francisco and earned a certificate as a Tribal Court Advocate.[3] From 1978 to 1981, she attended Anchorage Community College, which would later become the University of Alaska Anchorage.[3][5] In 1989 she moved to Boston to attend The Fletcher School at Tufts University, and she earned her Master of Arts in law and diplomacy in 1991.[2][3] She went on to earn a Ph.D. from the University of British Columbia, Faculty of Law in 2002.[6] Her daughter Hannah was born the day after she completed her comprehensive exams for her Ph.D.[7] Career[edit] After working as a paralegal for multiple organizations, in 1982 Dorough became the Executive Director for the Inuit Circumpolar Council in Anchorage, a position she held until 1989.[5] She went on to serve as the Executive Director for the International Union for Circumpolar Health (from 1991 to 1993) and the Alaska Inter-Tribal Council (from 1993 to 1994).[5] From 2008 to 2018, Dorough was an Assistant Professor of International Relations at the University of Alaska Anchorage.[7] In that role she took selected students to attend meetings of the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues.[3] After leaving her position as assistant professor, she continued her affiliation with the university as a senior scholar and special advisor on Arctic Indigenous Peoples.[8] Dorough was appointed to the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues by the U.N. Secretary General in 2011, serving two three year terms.[3] She is also the co-Chair of the International Law Association's Committee on Implementation of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.[7] In 2018 Dorough was unanimously elected as chair of the Inuit Circumpolar Council.[9] The organization represents approximately 165,000 Inuit from the Russian Far East, Alaska, Canada, and Greenland.[7] Dorough's efforts include promoting food security and protecting the Arctic environment in the face of climate change.[2][10] Awards[edit] In 1988 Dorough was honored with a Reebok Human Rights Award, and in 1989 she received the Bill Edmunds Award from the Inuit Circumpolar Council, recognizing her efforts for the promotion of Inuit rights and interests.[11] She was the recipient of a Patricia Roberts Harris Public Affairs Fellowship in 1989 and 1990.[12] She was the recipient of a Fulbright Scholarship during the 1995-1996 academic year.[1] Dorough was one of the ten ""Women of the Century"" selected to represent Alaska's most influential women as part of a project sponsored by USA Today in 2020.[1] References[edit] ^ a b c Schnell, Lindsay (August 13, 2020).

A semi-exclave of the U.S., it borders the Canadian province of British Columbia and the territory of Yukon to the east and has a maritime border with Russia's Chukotka Autonomous Okrug to the west, just across the Bering Strait. To the north are the Chukchi and Beaufort seas of the Arctic Ocean, while the Pacific Ocean lies to the south and southwest. Alaska is by far the largest U.S. state by area, comprising more total area than the next three largest states Texas, California, and Montana combined, and the seventh largest subnational division in the world. It is the third-least populous and the most sparsely populated state, but by far the continent's most populous territory located mostly north of the 60th parallel, with a population of 736,081 as of 2020—more than quadruple the combined populations of Northern Canada and Greenland.[3] Approximately half of Alaska's residents live within the Anchorage metropolitan area. The state capital of Juneau is the second-largest city in the United States by area, comprising more territory than the states of Rhode Island and Delaware. The former capital of Alaska, Sitka, is the largest U.S. city by area. Alaska was occupied by various indigenous peoples for thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans. The state is considered the entry point for the settlement of North America by way of the Bering land bridge. The Russians were the first Europeans to settle the area beginning in the 18th century, eventually establishing Russian America, which spanned most of the current state. The expense and difficulty of maintaining this distant possession prompted its sale to the U.S. in 1867 for US$7.2 million (equivalent to $133 million in 2020), or approximately two cents per acre ($4.74/km2). The area went through several administrative changes before becoming organized as a territory on May 11, 1912. It was admitted as the 49th state of the U.S. on January 3, 1959.[5] While it has one of the smallest state economies in the country, Alaska's per capita income is among the highest, owing to a diversified economy dominated by fishing, natural gas, and oil, all of which it has in abundance. United States armed forces bases and tourism are also a significant part of the economy; more than half the state is federally owned public land, including a multitude of national forests, national parks, and wildlife refuges. The indigenous population of Alaska is proportionally the highest of any U.S. state, at over 15 percent.[6] Close to two dozen native languages are spoken, and Alaskan Natives exercise considerable influence in local and state politics.

Alyáska) was introduced in the Russian colonial period when it was used to refer to the Alaska Peninsula. It was derived from an Aleut-language idiom, which figuratively refers to the mainland. Literally, it means object to which the action of the sea is directed.[7][8][9] History Main articles: Prehistory of Alaska and History of Alaska Pre-colonization Main article: Alaska Natives A modern Alutiiq dancer in traditional festival garb Numerous indigenous peoples occupied Alaska for thousands of years before the arrival of European peoples to the area. Linguistic and DNA studies done here have provided evidence for the settlement of North America by way of the Bering land bridge.[10] At the Upward Sun River site in the Tanana River Valley in Alaska, remains of a six-week-old infant were found. The baby's DNA showed that she belonged to a population that was genetically separate from other native groups present elsewhere in the New World at the end of the Pleistocene. Ben Potter, the University of Alaska Fairbanks archaeologist who unearthed the remains at the Upward Sun River site in 2013, named this new group Ancient Beringians.[11] The Tlingit people developed a society with a matrilineal kinship system of property inheritance and descent in what is today Southeast Alaska, along with parts of British Columbia and the Yukon. Also in Southeast were the Haida, now well known for their unique arts. The Tsimshian people came to Alaska from British Columbia in 1887, when President Grover Cleveland, and later the U.S. Congress, granted them permission to settle on Annette Island and found the town of Metlakatla. All three of these peoples, as well as other indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast, experienced smallpox outbreaks from the late 18th through the mid-19th century, with the most devastating epidemics occurring in the 1830s and 1860s, resulting in high fatalities and social disruption.[12] The Aleutian Islands are still home to the Aleut people's seafaring society, although they were the first Native Alaskans to be exploited by the Russians. Western and Southwestern Alaska are home to the Yup'ik, while their cousins the Alutiiq ~ Sugpiaq live in what is now Southcentral Alaska. The Gwich'in people of the northern Interior region are Athabaskan and primarily known today for their dependence on the caribou within the much-contested Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The North Slope and Little Diomede Island are occupied by the widespread Inupiat people. Colonization Main articles: Russian America, Department of Alaska, District of Alaska, Fairbanks Gold Rush, Kobuk River Stampede, and Nome Gold Rush The Russian settlement of St. Paul's Harbor (present-day Kodiak town), Kodiak Island, 1814 Miners and prospectors climb the Chilkoot Trail during the 1898 Klondike Gold Rush Some researchers believe the first Russian settlement in Alaska was established in the 17th century.[13] According to this hypothesis, in 1648 several koches of Semyon Dezhnyov's expedition came ashore in Alaska by storm and founded this settlement. This hypothesis is based on the testimony of Chukchi geographer Nikolai Daurkin, who had visited Alaska in 1764–1765 and who had reported on a village on the Kheuveren River, populated by ""bearded men"" who ""pray to the icons"". Some modern researchers associate Kheuveren with Koyuk River.[14] The first European vessel to reach Alaska is generally held to be the St. Gabriel under the authority of the surveyor M. S. Gvozdev and assistant navigator I. Fyodorov on August 21, 1732, during an expedition of Siberian cossack A. F. Shestakov and Russian explorer Dmitry Pavlutsky (1729–1735).[15] Another European contact with Alaska occurred in 1741, when Vitus Bering led an expedition for the Russian Navy aboard the St. Peter. After his crew returned to Russia with sea otter pelts judged to be the finest fur in the world, small associations of fur traders began to sail from the shores of Siberia toward the Aleutian Islands. The first permanent European settlement was founded in 1784. Between 1774 and 1800, Spain sent several expeditions to Alaska to assert its claim over the Pacific Northwest. In 1789, a Spanish settlement and fort were built in Nootka Sound. These expeditions gave names to places such as Valdez, Bucareli Sound, and Cordova. Later, the Russian-American Company carried out an expanded colonization program during the early-to-mid-19th century. Sitka, renamed New Archangel from 1804 to 1867, on Baranof Island in the Alexander Archipelago in what is now Southeast Alaska, became the capital of Russian America. It remained the capital after the colony was transferred to the United States. The Russians never fully colonized Alaska, and the colony was never very profitable. Evidence of Russian settlement in names and churches survive throughout southeastern Alaska. William H. Seward, the 24th United States Secretary of State, negotiated the Alaska Purchase (also known as Seward's Folly) with the Russians in 1867 for $7.2 million. Russia's contemporary ruler Tsar Alexander II, the Emperor of the Russian Empire, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Finland, also planned the sale;[16] the purchase was made on March 30, 1867. Six months later the commissioners arrived in Sitka and the formal transfer was arranged; the formal flag-raising took place at Fort Sitka on October 18, 1867. In the ceremony 250 uniformed U.S. soldiers marched to the governor's house at ""Castle Hill"", where the Russian troops lowered the Russian flag and the U.S. flag was raised. This event is celebrated as Alaska Day, a legal holiday on October 18. Alaska was loosely governed by the military initially, and was administered as a district starting in 1884, with a governor appointed by the United States president. A federal district court was headquartered in Sitka. For most of Alaska's first decade under the United States flag, Sitka was the only community inhabited by American settlers. They organized a ""provisional city government"", which was Alaska's first municipal government, but not in a legal sense.[17] Legislation allowing Alaskan communities to legally incorporate as cities did not come about until 1900, and home rule for cities was extremely limited or unavailable until statehood took effect in 1959. Alaska as an incorporated U.S. territory Main articles: Organic act § List of organic acts, and Territory of Alaska Starting in the 1890s and stretching in some places to the early 1910s, gold rushes in Alaska and the nearby Yukon Territory brought thousands of miners and settlers to Alaska. Alaska was officially incorporated as an organized territory in 1912. Alaska's capital, which had been in Sitka until 1906, was moved north to Juneau. Construction of the Alaska Governor's Mansion began that same year. European immigrants from Norway and Sweden also settled in southeast Alaska, where they entered the fishing and logging industries. U.S. troops navigate snow and ice during the Battle of Attu in May 1943 During World War II, the Aleutian Islands Campaign focused on Attu, Agattu and Kiska, all which were occupied by the Empire of Japan.[18] During the Japanese occupation, a white American civilian and two United States Navy personnel were killed at Attu and Kiska respectively, and nearly a total of 50 Aleut civilians and eight sailors were interned in Japan. About half of the Aleuts died during the period of internment.[19] Unalaska/Dutch Harbor and Adak became significant bases for the United States Army, United States Army Air Forces and United States Navy. The United States Lend-Lease program involved flying American warplanes through Canada to Fairbanks and then Nome; Soviet pilots took possession of these aircraft, ferrying them to fight the German invasion of the Soviet Union. The construction of military bases contributed to the population growth of some Alaskan cities. Statehood See also: Alaska Statehood Act, Admission to the Union, and List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union Statehood for Alaska was an important cause of James Wickersham early in his tenure as a congressional delegate. Decades later, the statehood movement gained its first real momentum following a territorial referendum in 1946. The Alaska Statehood Committee and Alaska's Constitutional Convention would soon follow. Statehood supporters also found themselves fighting major battles against political foes, mostly in the U.S. Congress but also within Alaska. Statehood was approved by the U.S. Congress on July 7, 1958; Alaska was officially proclaimed a state on January 3, 1959. Good Friday earthquake Main article: 1964 Alaska earthquake On March 27, 1964, the massive Good Friday earthquake killed 133 people and destroyed several villages and portions of large coastal communities, mainly by the resultant tsunamis and landslides. It was the second-most-powerful earthquake in recorded history, with a moment magnitude of 9.2 (more than a thousand times as powerful as the 1989 San Francisco earthquake).[20] The time of day (5:36 pm), time of year (spring) and location of the epicenter were all cited as factors in potentially sparing thousands of lives, particularly in Anchorage. Alaska oil boom The 1968 discovery of oil at Prudhoe Bay and the 1977 completion of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System led to an oil boom. Royalty revenues from oil have funded large state budgets from 1980 onward. That same year, not coincidentally, Alaska repealed its state income tax.[citation needed] In 1989, the Exxon Valdez hit a reef in the Prince William Sound, spilling more than 11 million U.S. gallons (42 megaliters) of crude oil over 1,100 miles (1,800 km) of coastline. Today, the battle between philosophies of development and conservation is seen in the contentious debate over oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the proposed Pebble Mine. Geography Main article: Geography of Alaska Located at the northwest corner of North America, Alaska is the northernmost and westernmost state in the United States, but also has the most easterly longitude in the United States because the Aleutian Islands extend into the Eastern Hemisphere.[21] Alaska is the only non-contiguous U.S. state on continental North America; about 500 miles (800 km) of British Columbia (Canada) separates Alaska from Washington. It is technically part of the continental U.S., but is sometimes not included in colloquial use; Alaska is not part of the contiguous U.S., often called ""the Lower 48"". The capital city, Juneau, is situated on the mainland of the North American continent but is not connected by road to the rest of the North American highway system. The state is bordered by Canada's Yukon and British Columbia to the east (making it the only state to border a Canadian territory); the Gulf of Alaska and the Pacific Ocean to the south and southwest; the Bering Sea, Bering Strait, and Chukchi Sea to the west; and the Arctic Ocean to the north. Alaska's territorial waters touch Russia's territorial waters in the Bering Strait, as the Russian Big Diomede Island and Alaskan Little Diomede Island are only 3 miles (4.8 km) apart. Alaska has a longer coastline than all the other U.S. states combined.[22] Alaska's size compared with the 48 contiguous states (Albers equal-area conic projection) At 663,268 square miles (1,717,856 km2) in area, Alaska is by far the largest state in the United States, and is more than twice the size of the second-largest U.S. state, Texas. Alaska is the seventh largest subnational division in the world, and if it was an independent nation would be the 16th largest country in the world, as it is larger than Iran. With its myriad islands, Alaska has nearly 34,000 miles (55,000 km) of tidal shoreline. The Aleutian Islands chain extends west from the southern tip of the Alaska Peninsula. Many active volcanoes are found in the Aleutians and in coastal regions. Unimak Island, for example, is home to Mount Shishaldin, which is an occasionally smoldering volcano that rises to 10,000 feet (3,000 m) above the North Pacific. The chain of volcanoes extends to Mount Spurr, west of Anchorage on the mainland. Geologists have identified Alaska as part of Wrangellia, a large region consisting of multiple states and Canadian provinces in the Pacific Northwest, which is actively undergoing continent building. One of the world's largest tides occurs in Turnagain Arm, just south of Anchorage, where tidal differences can be more than 35 feet (10.7 m).[23] Alaska has more than three million lakes.[24] Marshlands and wetland permafrost cover 188,320 square miles (487,700 km2) (mostly in northern, western and southwest flatlands). Glacier ice covers about 28,957 square miles (75,000 km2) of Alaska.[25] The Bering Glacier is the largest glacier in North America, covering 2,008 square miles (5,200 km2) alone.[26] Regions There are no officially defined borders demarcating the various regions of Alaska, but there are six widely accepted regions: South Central Main article: South Central Alaska The most populous region of Alaska, containing Anchorage, the Matanuska-Susitna Valley and the Kenai Peninsula. Rural, mostly unpopulated areas south of the Alaska Range and west of the Wrangell Mountains also fall within the definition of South Central, as do the Prince William Sound area and the communities of Cordova and Valdez.[27] Southeast Main article: Southeast Alaska Also referred to as the Panhandle or Inside Passage, this is the region of Alaska closest to the contiguous states. As such, this was where most of the initial non-indigenous settlement occurred in the years following the Alaska Purchase. The region is dominated by the Alexander Archipelago as well as the Tongass National Forest, the largest national forest in the United States. It contains the state capital Juneau, the former capital Sitka, and Ketchikan, at one time Alaska's largest city.[28] The Alaska Marine Highway provides a vital surface transportation link throughout the area and country, as only three communities (Haines, Hyder and Skagway) enjoy direct connections to the contiguous North American road system.[29] Interior Main article: Alaska Interior Denali is the highest peak in North America. The Interior is the largest region of Alaska; much of it is uninhabited wilderness. Fairbanks is the only large city in the region. Denali National Park and Preserve is located here. Denali, formerly Mount McKinley, is the highest mountain in North America, and is also located here. Southwest Main article: Southwest AlaskaSouthwest Alaska is a sparsely inhabited region stretching some 500 miles (800 km) inland from the Bering Sea. Most of the population lives along the coast. Kodiak Island is also located in Southwest. The massive Yukon–Kuskokwim Delta, one of the largest river deltas in the world, is here. Portions of the Alaska Peninsula are considered part of Southwest, with the remaining portions included with the Aleutian Islands (see below). North Slope Main article: Alaska North Slope The North Slope is mostly tundra peppered with small villages. The area is known for its massive reserves of crude oil and contains both the National Petroleum Reserve–Alaska and the Prudhoe Bay Oil Field.[30] The city of Utqiaġvik, formerly known as Barrow, is the northernmost city in the United States and is located here. The Northwest Arctic area, anchored by Kotzebue and also containing the Kobuk River valley, is often regarded as being part of this region. However, the respective Inupiat of the North Slope and of the Northwest Arctic seldom consider themselves to be one people.[31] Aleutian Islands Main article: Aleutian Islands More than 300 small volcanic islands make up this chain, which stretches more than 1,200 miles (1,900 km) into the Pacific Ocean. Some of these islands fall in the Eastern Hemisphere, but the International Date Line was drawn west of 180° to keep the whole state, and thus the entire North American continent, within the same legal day. Two of the islands, Attu and Kiska, were occupied by Japanese forces during World War II. Land ownership According to an October 1998 report by the United States Bureau of Land Management, approximately 65% of Alaska is owned and managed by the U.S. federal government as public lands, including a multitude of national forests, national parks, and national wildlife refuges.[32] Of these, the Bureau of Land Management manages 87 million acres (35 million hectares), or 23.8% of the state. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. It is the world's largest wildlife refuge, comprising 16 million acres (6.5 million hectares). Of the remaining land area, the state of Alaska owns 101 million acres (41 million hectares), its entitlement under the Alaska Statehood Act. A portion of that acreage is occasionally ceded to the organized boroughs presented above, under the statutory provisions pertaining to newly formed boroughs. Smaller portions are set aside for rural subdivisions and other homesteading-related opportunities. These are not very popular due to the often remote and roadless locations. The University of Alaska, as a land grant university, also owns substantial acreage which it manages independently. Another 44 million acres (18 million hectares) are owned by 12 regional, and scores of local, Native corporations created under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) of 1971. Regional Native corporation Doyon, Limited often promotes itself as the largest private landowner in Alaska in advertisements and other communications. Provisions of ANCSA allowing the corporations' land holdings to be sold on the open market starting in 1991 were repealed before they could take effect. Effectively, the corporations hold title (including subsurface title in many cases, a privilege denied to individual Alaskans) but cannot sell the land. Individual Native allotments can be and are sold on the open market, however. Various private interests own the remaining land, totaling about one percent of the state. Alaska is, by a large margin, the state with the smallest percentage of private land ownership when Native corporation holdings are excluded. Alaska Heritage Resources Survey The Alaska Heritage Resources Survey (AHRS) is a restricted inventory of all reported historic and prehistoric sites within the U.S. state of Alaska; it is maintained by the Office of History and Archaeology. The survey's inventory of cultural resources includes objects, structures, buildings, sites, districts, and travel ways, with a general provision that they are more than fifty years old. As of 31 January 2012[update], more than 35,000 sites have been reported.[33] Cities, towns and boroughs Anchorage, Alaska's largest city Fairbanks, Alaska's second-largest city and by a significant margin the largest city in Alaska's interior Juneau, Alaska's third-largest city and its capital Bethel, the largest city in the Unorganized Borough and in rural Alaska Homer, showing (from bottom to top) the edge of downtown, its airport and the Spit Utqiaġvik (Browerville neighborhood near Eben Hopson Middle School shown), known colloquially for many years by the nickname ""Top of the World"", is the northernmost city in the United States. Cordova, built in the early 20th century to support the Kennecott Mines and the Copper River and Northwestern Railway, has persevered as a fishing community since their closure. Main Street in Talkeetna See also: List of cities in Alaska by population, Alaska locations by per capita income, and List of boroughs and census areas in Alaska Alaska is not divided into counties, as most of the other U.S. states, but it is divided into boroughs.[34] Many of the more densely populated parts of the state are part of Alaska's 16 boroughs, which function somewhat similarly to counties in other states. However, unlike county-equivalents in the other 49 states, the boroughs do not cover the entire land area of the state. The area not part of any borough is referred to as the Unorganized Borough. The Unorganized Borough has no government of its own, but the U.S. Census Bureau in cooperation with the state divided the Unorganized Borough into 11 census areas solely for the purposes of statistical analysis and presentation. A recording district is a mechanism for management of the public record in Alaska. The state is divided into 34 recording districts which are centrally administered under a state recorder. All recording districts use the same acceptance criteria, fee schedule, etc., for accepting documents into the public record. Whereas many U.S. states use a three-tiered system of decentralization—state/county/township—most of Alaska uses only two tiers—state/borough. Owing to the low population density, most of the land is located in the Unorganized Borough. As the name implies, it has no intermediate borough government but is administered directly by the state government. In 2000, 57.71% of Alaska's area has this status, with 13.05% of the population.[35] Anchorage merged the city government with the Greater Anchorage Area Borough in 1975 to form the Municipality of Anchorage, containing the city proper and the communities of Eagle River, Chugiak, Peters Creek, Girdwood, Bird, and Indian. Fairbanks has a separate borough (the Fairbanks North Star Borough) and municipality (the City of Fairbanks). The state's most populous city is Anchorage, home to 278,700 people in 2006, 225,744 of whom live in the urbanized area. The richest location in Alaska by per capita income is Denali ($42,245). Yakutat City, Sitka, Juneau, and Anchorage are the four largest cities in the U.S. by area. Cities and census-designated places (by population) As reflected in the 2010 United States census, Alaska has a total of 355 incorporated cities and census-designated places (CDPs). The tally of cities includes four unified municipalities, essentially the equivalent of a consolidated city–county. The majority of these communities are located in the rural expanse of Alaska known as ""The Bush"" and are unconnected to the contiguous North American road network. The table at the bottom of this section lists the 100 largest cities and census-designated places in Alaska, in population order. Of Alaska's 2010 U.S. census population figure of 710,231, 20,429 people, or 2.88% of the population, did not live in an incorporated city or census-designated place. Approximately three-quarters of that figure were people who live in urban and suburban neighborhoods on the outskirts of the city limits of Ketchikan, Kodiak, Palmer and Wasilla. CDPs have not been established for these areas by the United States Census Bureau, except that seven CDPs were established for the Ketchikan-area neighborhoods in the 1980 Census (Clover Pass, Herring Cove, Ketchikan East, Mountain Point, North Tongass Highway, Pennock Island and Saxman East), but have not been used since. The remaining population was scattered throughout Alaska, both within organized boroughs and in the Unorganized Borough, in largely remote areas.

On an annual basis, the southeast is both the wettest and warmest part of Alaska with milder temperatures in the winter and high precipitation throughout the year. Juneau averages over 50 in (130 cm) of precipitation a year, and Ketchikan averages over 150 in (380 cm).[37] This is also the only region in Alaska in which the average daytime high temperature is above freezing during the winter months. Köppen climate types of AlaskaThe climate of Anchorage and south central Alaska is mild by Alaskan standards due to the region's proximity to the seacoast. While the area gets less rain than southeast Alaska, it gets more snow, and days tend to be clearer. On average, Anchorage receives 16 in (41 cm) of precipitation a year, with around 75 in (190 cm) of snow, although there are areas in the south central which receive far more snow. It is a subarctic climate (Köppen: Dfc) due to its brief, cool summers. The climate of western Alaska is determined in large part by the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska. It is a subarctic oceanic climate in the southwest and a continental subarctic climate farther north. The temperature is somewhat moderate considering how far north the area is. This region has a tremendous amount of variety in precipitation. An area stretching from the northern side of the Seward Peninsula to the Kobuk River valley (i.e., the region around Kotzebue Sound) is technically a desert, with portions receiving less than 10 in (25 cm) of precipitation annually. On the other extreme, some locations between Dillingham and Bethel average around 100 in (250 cm) of precipitation.[38] The climate of the interior of Alaska is subarctic. Some of the highest and lowest temperatures in Alaska occur around the area near Fairbanks. The summers may have temperatures reaching into the 90s °F (the low-to-mid 30s °C), while in the winter, the temperature can fall below −60 °F (−51 °C). Precipitation is sparse in the Interior, often less than 10 in (25 cm) a year, but what precipitation falls in the winter tends to stay the entire winter. The highest and lowest recorded temperatures in Alaska are both in the Interior. The highest is 100 °F (38 °C) in Fort Yukon (which is just 8 mi or 13 km inside the arctic circle) on June 27, 1915,[39][40] making Alaska tied with Hawaii as the state with the lowest high temperature in the United States.[41][42] The lowest official Alaska temperature is −80 °F (−62 °C) in Prospect Creek on January 23, 1971,[39][40] one degree above the lowest temperature recorded in continental North America (in Snag, Yukon, Canada).[43] The climate in the extreme north of Alaska is Arctic (Köppen: ET) with long, very cold winters and short, cool summers. Even in July, the average low temperature in Utqiaġvik is 34 °F (1 °C).[44] Precipitation is light in this part of Alaska, with many places averaging less than 10 in (25 cm) per year, mostly as snow which stays on the ground almost the entire year.

In 2010, Alaska ranked as the 47th state by population, ahead of North Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming (and Washington, D.C.). Estimates show North Dakota ahead as of 2018[update].[47] Alaska is the least densely populated state, and one of the most sparsely populated areas in the world, at 1.2 inhabitants per square mile (0.46/km2), with the next state, Wyoming, at 5.8 inhabitants per square mile (2.2/km2).[48] Alaska is by far the largest U.S. state by area, and the tenth wealthiest (per capita income).[49] As of 2018[update] due to its population size, it is one of 14 U.S. states that still have only one telephone area code.[50] Race and ethnicity Alaska racial breakdown of population Racial composition 1970[51] 1990[51] 2000[52] 2010[53] 2020[54] White 78.8% 75.5% 69.3% 66.7% 59.4% Native 16.9% 15.6% 15.6% 14.8% 15.2% Asian 0.9% 3.6% 4.0% 5.4% 6.0% Black 3.0% 4.1% 3.5% 3.3% 3.0% Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander – – 0.5% 1.0% 1.7% Other race 0.4% 1.2% 1.6% 1.6% 2.5% Multiracial – – 5.5% 7.3% 12.2% Map of the largest racial/ethnic group by borough.

At the survey estimates, 7.8% of the total population was foreign-born from 2015 to 2019.[55] In 2015, 61.3% was non-Hispanic white, 3.4% Black or African American, 13.3% American Indian or Alaska Native, 6.2% Asian, 0.9% Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander, 0.3% some other race, and 7.7% multiracial. Hispanics and Latin Americans were 7% of the state population in 2015.[56] From 2015 to 2019, the largest Hispanic and Latin American groups were Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Cuban Americans. The largest Asian groups living in the state were Filipinos, Korean Americans, and Japanese and Chinese Americans.[57] The state was 66.7% White (64.1% non-Hispanic white), 14.8% American Indian and Alaska Native, 5.4% Asian, 3.3% Black or African American, 1.0% Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander, 1.6% from some other race, and 7.3% from two or more races in 2010. Hispanics or Latin Americans of any race made up 5.5% of the population in 2010.[58] As of 2011[update], 50.7% of Alaska's population younger than one year of age belonged to minority groups (i.e., did not have two parents of non-Hispanic white ancestry).[59] In 1960, the United States Census Bureau reported Alaska's population as 77.2% White, 3% Black, and 18.8% American Indian and Alaska Native.[60] Languages Further information: Alaska Native languages According to the 2011 American Community Survey, 83.4% of people over the age of five spoke only English at home. About 3.5% spoke Spanish at home, 2.2% spoke another Indo-European language, about 4.3% spoke an Asian language (including Tagalog),[61] and about 5.3% spoke other languages at home.[62] In 2019, the American Community Survey determined 83.7% spoke only English, and 16.3% spoke another language other than English. The most spoken European language after English was Spanish, spoken by approximately 4.0% of the state population. Collectively, Asian and Pacific Islander languages were spoken by 5.6% of Alaskans.[63] Since 2010, a total of 5.2% of Alaskans speak one of the state's 20 indigenous languages,[64] known locally as ""native languages"". The Alaska Native Language Center at the University of Alaska Fairbanks claims that at least 20 Alaskan native languages exist and there are also some languages with different dialects.[65] Most of Alaska's native languages belong to either the Eskimo–Aleut or Na-Dene language families; however, some languages are thought to be isolates (e.g. Haida) or have not yet been classified (e.g. Tsimshianic).[65] As of 2014[update] nearly all of Alaska's native languages were classified as either threatened, shifting, moribund, nearly extinct, or dormant languages.[66] In October 2014, the governor of Alaska signed a bill declaring the state's 20 indigenous languages to have official status.[67][68] This bill gave them symbolic recognition as official languages, though they have not been adopted for official use within the government. The 20 languages that were included in the bill are: Inupiaq Siberian Yupik Central Alaskan Yup'ik Alutiiq Unangax Dena'ina Deg Xinag Holikachuk Koyukon Upper Kuskokwim Gwich'in Tanana Upper Tanana Tanacross Hän Ahtna Eyak Tlingit Haida Tsimshian Religion See also: Alaska Native religion St. Michael's Russian Orthodox Cathedral in downtown Sitka Gold Rush-era Baptist church in Eagle ChangePoint in south Anchorage (left) and Anchorage Baptist Temple in east Anchorage (right) are Alaska's largest churches in terms of attendance and membership. According to statistics collected by the Association of Religion Data Archives from 2010, about 34% of Alaska residents were members of religious congregations. Of the religious population, 100,960 people identified as evangelical Protestants; 50,866 as Roman Catholic; and 32,550 as mainline Protestants.[69] Roughly 4% were Mormon, 0.5% Jewish, 1% Muslim, 0.5% Buddhist, 0.2% Baháʼí, and 0.5% Hindu.[70] The largest religious denominations in Alaska as of 2010[update] was the Catholic Church with 50,866 adherents; non-denominational Evangelicals with 38,070 adherents; The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints with 32,170 adherents; and the Southern Baptist Convention with 19,891 adherents.[71] Alaska has been identified, along with Pacific Northwest states Washington and Oregon, as being the least religious states of the USA, in terms of church membership.[72][73] The Pew Research Center in 2014 determined 62% of the adult population practiced Christianity. Protestantism was the largest Christian tradition, dominated by Evangelicalism. Mainline Protestants were the second largest Protestant Christian group, followed by predominantly African American churches. The Catholic Church remained the largest single Christian tradition practiced in Alaska. Of the unaffiliated population, they made up the largest non-Christian religious affiliation. Atheists made up 5% of the population and the largest non-Christian religion was Buddhism. In 1795, the first Russian Orthodox Church was established in Kodiak. Intermarriage with Alaskan Natives helped the Russian immigrants integrate into society. As a result, an increasing number of Russian Orthodox churches gradually became established within Alaska.[74] Alaska also has the largest Quaker population (by percentage) of any state.[75] In 2009 there were 6,000 Jews in Alaska (for whom observance of halakha may pose special problems).[76] Alaskan Hindus often share venues and celebrations with members of other Asian religious communities, including Sikhs and Jains.[77][78][79] In 2010, Alaskan Hindus established the Sri Ganesha Temple of Alaska, making it the first Hindu Temple in Alaska and the northernmost Hindu Temple in the world. There are an estimated 2,000–3,000 Hindus in Alaska. The vast majority of Hindus live in Anchorage or Fairbanks. Estimates for the number of Muslims in Alaska range from 2,000 to 5,000.[80][81][82] The Islamic Community Center of Anchorage began efforts in the late 1990s to construct a mosque in Anchorage. They broke ground on a building in south Anchorage in 2010 and were nearing completion in late 2014. When completed, the mosque will be the first in the state and one of the northernmost mosques in the world.[83] There's also a Baháʼí center.[84] Religious affiliation in Alaska (2014)[85] Affiliation % of population Christian 62 62 Protestant 37 37 Evangelical Protestant 22 22 Mainline Protestant 12 12 Black church 3 3 Catholic 16 16 Mormon 5 5 Jehovah's Witnesses 0.5 0.5 Eastern Orthodox 5 5 Other Christian 0.5 0.5 Unaffiliated 31 31 Nothing in particular 20 20 Agnostic 6 6 Atheist 5 5 Non-Christian faiths 6 6 Jewish 0.5 0.5 Muslim 0.5 0.5 Baháʼí 0.2 0.2 Buddhist 1 1 Hindu 0.5 0.5 Other Non-Christian faiths 4 4 Don't know/refused answer 1 1 Total 100 100 Economy Main article: Economy of Alaska See also: Alaska locations by per capita income and List of Alaska companies Aerial view of infrastructure at the Prudhoe Bay Oil FieldAs of 2016, Alaska had a total employment of 266,072. The number of employer establishments was 21,077.[86] The 2018 gross state product was $55 billion, 48th in the U.S.. Its per capita personal income for 2018 was $73,000, ranking 7th in the nation. According to a 2013 study by Phoenix Marketing International, Alaska had the fifth-largest number of millionaires per capita in the United States, with a ratio of 6.75 percent.[87] The oil and gas industry dominates the Alaskan economy, with more than 80% of the state's revenues derived from petroleum extraction. Alaska's main export product (excluding oil and natural gas) is seafood, primarily salmon, cod, Pollock and crab. Agriculture represents a very small fraction of the Alaskan economy. Agricultural production is primarily for consumption within the state and includes nursery stock, dairy products, vegetables, and livestock. Manufacturing is limited, with most foodstuffs and general goods imported from elsewhere. Employment is primarily in government and industries such as natural resource extraction, shipping, and transportation. Military bases are a significant component of the economy in the Fairbanks North Star, Anchorage and Kodiak Island boroughs, as well as Kodiak. Federal subsidies are also an important part of the economy, allowing the state to keep taxes low. Its industrial outputs are crude petroleum, natural gas, coal, gold, precious metals, zinc and other mining, seafood processing, timber and wood products. There is also a growing service and tourism sector. Tourists have contributed to the economy by supporting local lodging. Energy See also: Natural gas in Alaska, List of power stations in Alaska, and Energy law § Alaska law The Trans-Alaska Pipeline transports oil, Alaska's most financially important export, from the North Slope to Valdez. The heat pipes in the column mounts are pertinent, since they disperse heat upwards and prevent melting of permafrost. Alaska proven oil reserves peaked in 1973 and have declined more than 60% since then Alaskan oil production peaked in 1988 and has declined more than 75% since then Alaska has vast energy resources, although its oil reserves have been largely depleted. Major oil and gas reserves were found in the Alaska North Slope (ANS) and Cook Inlet basins, but according to the Energy Information Administration, by February 2014 Alaska had fallen to fourth place in the nation in crude oil production after Texas, North Dakota, and California.[88][89] Prudhoe Bay on Alaska's North Slope is still the second highest-yielding oil field in the United States, typically producing about 400,000 barrels per day (64,000 m3/d), although by early 2014 North Dakota's Bakken Formation was producing over 900,000 barrels per day (140,000 m3/d).[90] Prudhoe Bay was the largest conventional oil field ever discovered in North America, but was much smaller than Canada's enormous Athabasca oil sands field, which by 2014 was producing about 1,500,000 barrels per day (240,000 m3/d) of unconventional oil, and had hundreds of years of producible reserves at that rate.[91] The Trans-Alaska Pipeline can transport and pump up to 2.1 million barrels (330,000 m3) of crude oil per day, more than any other crude oil pipeline in the United States. Additionally, substantial coal deposits are found in Alaska's bituminous, sub-bituminous, and lignite coal basins. The United States Geological Survey estimates that there are 85.4 trillion cubic feet (2,420 km3) of undiscovered, technically recoverable gas from natural gas hydrates on the Alaskan North Slope.[92] Alaska also offers some of the highest hydroelectric power potential in the country from its numerous rivers. Large swaths of the Alaskan coastline offer wind and geothermal energy potential as well.[93] Alaska's economy depends heavily on increasingly expensive diesel fuel for heating, transportation, electric power and light. Although wind and hydroelectric power are abundant and underdeveloped, proposals for statewide energy systems (e.g. with special low-cost electric interties) were judged uneconomical (at the time of the report, 2001) due to low (less than 50¢/gal) fuel prices, long distances and low population.[94] The cost of a gallon of gas in urban Alaska today is usually thirty to sixty cents higher than the national average; prices in rural areas are generally significantly higher but vary widely depending on transportation costs, seasonal usage peaks, nearby petroleum development infrastructure and many other factors. Permanent Fund The Alaska Permanent Fund is a constitutionally authorized appropriation of oil revenues, established by voters in 1976 to manage a surplus in state petroleum revenues from oil, largely in anticipation of the then recently constructed Trans-Alaska Pipeline System. The fund was originally proposed by Governor Keith Miller on the eve of the 1969 Prudhoe Bay lease sale, out of fear that the legislature would spend the entire proceeds of the sale (which amounted to $900 million) at once. It was later championed by Governor Jay Hammond and Kenai state representative Hugh Malone. It has served as an attractive political prospect ever since, diverting revenues which would normally be deposited into the general fund. The Alaska Constitution was written so as to discourage dedicating state funds for a particular purpose. The Permanent Fund has become the rare exception to this, mostly due to the political climate of distrust existing during the time of its creation. From its initial principal of $734,000, the fund has grown to $50 billion as a result of oil royalties and capital investment programs.[95] Most if not all the principal is invested conservatively outside Alaska. This has led to frequent calls by Alaskan politicians for the Fund to make investments within Alaska, though such a stance has never gained momentum. Starting in 1982, dividends from the fund's annual growth have been paid out each year to eligible Alaskans, ranging from an initial $1,000 in 1982 (equal to three years' payout, as the distribution of payments was held up in a lawsuit over the distribution scheme) to $3,269 in 2008 (which included a one-time $1,200 ""Resource Rebate""). Every year, the state legislature takes out 8% from the earnings, puts 3% back into the principal for inflation proofing, and the remaining 5% is distributed to all qualifying Alaskans. To qualify for the Permanent Fund Dividend, one must have lived in the state for a minimum of 12 months, maintain constant residency subject to allowable absences,[96] and not be subject to court judgments or criminal convictions which fall under various disqualifying classifications or may subject the payment amount to civil garnishment. The Permanent Fund is often considered to be one of the leading examples of a ""Basic income"" policy in the world.[97] Cost of living The cost of goods in Alaska has long been higher than in the contiguous 48 states. Federal government employees, particularly United States Postal Service (USPS) workers and active-duty military members, receive a Cost of Living Allowance usually set at 25% of base pay because, while the cost of living has gone down, it is still one of the highest in the country.[98] Rural Alaska suffers from extremely high prices for food and consumer goods compared to the rest of the country, due to the relatively limited transportation infrastructure.[98] Agriculture and fishing Halibut, both as a sport fish and commercially, is important to the state's economy. Due to the northern climate and short growing season, relatively little farming occurs in Alaska. Most farms are in either the Matanuska Valley, about 40 miles (64 km) northeast of Anchorage, or on the Kenai Peninsula, about 60 miles (97 km) southwest of Anchorage. The short 100-day growing season limits the crops that can be grown, but the long sunny summer days make for productive growing seasons. The primary crops are potatoes, carrots, lettuce, and cabbage. The Tanana Valley is another notable agricultural locus, especially the Delta Junction area, about 100 miles (160 km) southeast of Fairbanks, with a sizable concentration of farms growing agronomic crops; these farms mostly lie north and east of Fort Greely. This area was largely set aside and developed under a state program spearheaded by Hammond during his second term as governor. Delta-area crops consist predominantly of barley and hay. West of Fairbanks lies another concentration of small farms catering to restaurants, the hotel and tourist industry, and community-supported agriculture. Alaskan agriculture has experienced a surge in growth of market gardeners, small farms and farmers' markets in recent years, with the highest percentage increase (46%) in the nation in growth in farmers' markets in 2011, compared to 17% nationwide.[99] The peony industry has also taken off, as the growing season allows farmers to harvest during a gap in supply elsewhere in the world, thereby filling a niche in the flower market.[100] Oversized vegetables on display at the Alaska State Fair (left) and the Tanana Valley State Fair (right) Alaska, with no counties, lacks county fairs. However, a small assortment of state and local fairs (with the Alaska State Fair in Palmer the largest), are held mostly in the late summer. The fairs are mostly located in communities with historic or current agricultural activity, and feature local farmers exhibiting produce in addition to more high-profile commercial activities such as carnival rides, concerts and food. ""Alaska Grown"" is used as an agricultural slogan. Alaska has an abundance of seafood, with the primary fisheries in the Bering Sea and the North Pacific. Seafood is one of the few food items that is often cheaper within the state than outside it. Many Alaskans take advantage of salmon seasons to harvest portions of their household diet while fishing for subsistence, as well as sport. This includes fish taken by hook, net or wheel.[101] Hunting for subsistence, primarily caribou, moose, and Dall sheep is still common in the state, particularly in remote Bush communities. An example of a traditional native food is Akutaq, the Eskimo ice cream, which can consist of reindeer fat, seal oil, dried fish meat and local berries. Alaska's reindeer herding is concentrated on Seward Peninsula, where wild caribou can be prevented from mingling and migrating with the domesticated reindeer.[102] Most food in Alaska is transported into the state from ""Outside"" (the other 49 US states), and shipping costs make food in the cities relatively expensive. In rural areas, subsistence hunting and gathering is an essential activity because imported food is prohibitively expensive. Although most small towns and villages in Alaska lie along the coastline, the cost of importing food to remote villages can be high, because of the terrain and difficult road conditions, which change dramatically, due to varying climate and precipitation changes. The cost of transport can reach as high as 50¢ per pound ($1.10/kg) or more in some remote areas, during the most difficult times, if these locations can be reached at all during such inclement weather and terrain conditions. The cost of delivering a 1 US gallon (3.8 L) of milk is about $3.50 in many villages where per capita income can be $20,000 or less. Fuel cost per gallon is routinely twenty to thirty cents higher than the contiguous United States average, with only Hawaii having higher prices.[103][104] Culture See also: List of artists and writers from Alaska A dog team in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, arguably the most popular winter event in Alaska Mask Display at Iñupiat Heritage Center in Utqiaġvik Some of Alaska's popular annual events are the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race from Anchorage to Nome, World Ice Art Championships in Fairbanks, the Blueberry Festival and Alaska Hummingbird Festival in Ketchikan, the Sitka Whale Fest, and the Stikine River Garnet Fest in Wrangell. The Stikine River attracts the largest springtime concentration of American bald eagles in the world. The Alaska Native Heritage Center celebrates the rich heritage of Alaska's 11 cultural groups. Their purpose is to encourage cross-cultural exchanges among all people and enhance self-esteem among Native people. The Alaska Native Arts Foundation promotes and markets Native art from all regions and cultures in the State, using the internet.[105] Music Main article: Music of Alaska Influences on music in Alaska include the traditional music of Alaska Natives as well as folk music brought by later immigrants from Russia and Europe. Prominent musicians from Alaska include singer Jewel, traditional Aleut flautist Mary Youngblood, folk singer-songwriter Libby Roderick, Christian music singer-songwriter Lincoln Brewster, metal/post hardcore band 36 Crazyfists and the groups Pamyua and Portugal. The Man. There are many established music festivals in Alaska, including the Alaska Folk Festival, the Fairbanks Summer Arts Festival the Anchorage Folk Festival, the Athabascan Old-Time Fiddling Festival, the Sitka Jazz Festival, and the Sitka Summer Music Festival. The most prominent orchestra in Alaska is the Anchorage Symphony Orchestra, though the Fairbanks Symphony Orchestra and Juneau Symphony are also notable. The Anchorage Opera is currently the state's only professional opera company, though there are several volunteer and semi-professional organizations in the state as well. The official state song of Alaska is ""Alaska's Flag"", which was adopted in 1955; it celebrates the flag of Alaska. Alaska in film and on television See also: List of films set in Alaska Films featuring Alaskan wolves usually employ domesticated wolf-dog hybrids to stand in for wild wolves. Alaska's first independent picture entirely made in Alaska was The Chechahcos, produced by Alaskan businessman Austin E. Lathrop and filmed in and around Anchorage. Released in 1924 by the Alaska Moving Picture Corporation, it was the only film the company made. One of the most prominent movies filmed in Alaska is MGM's Eskimo/Mala The Magnificent, starring Alaska Native Ray Mala. In 1932 an expedition set out from MGM's studios in Hollywood to Alaska to film what was then billed as ""The Biggest Picture Ever Made"". Upon arriving in Alaska, they set up ""Camp Hollywood"" in Northwest Alaska, where they lived during the duration of the filming. Louis B. Mayer spared no expense in spite of the remote location, going so far as to hire the chef from the Hotel Roosevelt in Hollywood to prepare meals.[citation needed] When Eskimo premiered at the Astor Theatre in New York City, the studio received the largest amount of feedback in its history. Eskimo was critically acclaimed and released worldwide; as a result, Mala became an international movie star. Eskimo won the first Oscar for Best Film Editing at the Academy Awards, and showcased and preserved aspects of Inupiat culture on film. The 1983 Disney movie Never Cry Wolf was at least partially shot in Alaska. The 1991 film White Fang, based on Jack London's 1906 novel and starring Ethan Hawke, was filmed in and around Haines. Steven Seagal's 1994 On Deadly Ground, starring Michael Caine, was filmed in part at the Worthington Glacier near Valdez.[106] The 1999 John Sayles film Limbo, starring David Strathairn, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, and Kris Kristofferson, was filmed in Juneau. The psychological thriller Insomnia, starring Al Pacino and Robin Williams, was shot in Canada, but was set in Alaska. The 2007 film directed by Sean Penn, Into The Wild, was partially filmed and set in Alaska. The film, which is based on the novel of the same name, follows the adventures of Christopher McCandless, who died in a remote abandoned bus along the Stampede Trail west of Healy in 1992. Many films and television shows set in Alaska are not filmed there; for example, Northern Exposure, set in the fictional town of Cicely, Alaska, was filmed in Roslyn, Washington. The 2007 horror feature 30 Days of Night is set in Barrow, Alaska[note 1], but was filmed in New Zealand. Many reality television shows are filmed in Alaska. In 2011 the Anchorage Daily News found ten set in the state.[107] Public health and public safety See also: Dentistry in rural Alaska The Alaska State Troopers are Alaska's statewide police force. They have a long and storied history, but were not an official organization until 1941. Before the force was officially organized, law enforcement in Alaska was handled by various federal agencies. Larger towns usually have their own local police and some villages rely on ""Public Safety Officers"" who have police training but do not carry firearms. In much of the state, the troopers serve as the only police force available. In addition to enforcing traffic and criminal law, wildlife Troopers enforce hunting and fishing regulations. Due to the varied terrain and wide scope of the Troopers' duties, they employ a wide variety of land, air, and water patrol vehicles. Many rural communities in Alaska are considered ""dry"", having outlawed the importation of alcoholic beverages.[108] Suicide rates for rural residents are higher than urban.[109] Domestic abuse and other violent crimes are also at high levels in the state; this is in part linked to alcohol abuse.[110] Alaska has the highest rate of sexual assault in the nation, especially in rural areas. The average age of sexually assaulted victims is 16 years old. In four out of five cases, the suspects were relatives, friends or acquaintances.[111] Education The Kachemak Bay Campus of the University of Alaska Anchorage, located in downtown Homer The Alaska Department of Education and Early Development administers many school districts in Alaska. In addition, the state operates a boarding school, Mt. Edgecumbe High School in Sitka, and provides partial funding for other boarding schools, including Nenana Student Living Center in Nenana and The Galena Interior Learning Academy in Galena.[112] There are more than a dozen colleges and universities in Alaska. Accredited universities in Alaska include the University of Alaska Anchorage, University of Alaska Fairbanks, University of Alaska Southeast, and Alaska Pacific University.[113] Alaska is the only state that has no institutions that are part of NCAA Division I. The Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development operates AVTEC, Alaska's Institute of Technology.[114] Campuses in Seward and Anchorage offer one-week to 11-month training programs in areas as diverse as Information Technology, Welding, Nursing, and Mechanics. Alaska has had a problem with a ""brain drain"". Many of its young people, including most of the highest academic achievers, leave the state after high school graduation and do not return. As of 2013[update], Alaska did not have a law school or medical school.[115] The University of Alaska has attempted to combat this by offering partial four-year scholarships to the top 10% of Alaska high school graduates, via the Alaska Scholars Program.[116] Beginning in 1998, schools in rural Alaska must have at least 10 students to retain funding from the state, and campuses not meeting the number close. This was due to the loss in oil revenues that previously propped up smaller rural schools.[117] In 2015 there was a proposal to raise that minimum to 25,[118] but legislators in the state largely did not agree.[119] Transportation Main article: Transportation in Alaska This section needs additional citations for verification.

Alaska Interstate Highways Alaska has few road connections compared to the rest of the U.S. The state's road system, covering a relatively small area of the state, linking the central population centers and the Alaska Highway, the principal route out of the state through Canada. The state capital, Juneau, is not accessible by road, only a car ferry; this has spurred debate over decades about moving the capital to a city on the road system, or building a road connection from Haines. The western part of Alaska has no road system connecting the communities with the rest of Alaska. Alaska welcome sign on the Klondike Highway The Interstate Highways in Alaska consists of a total of 1,082 miles (1,741 km). One unique feature of the Alaska Highway system is the Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel, an active Alaska Railroad tunnel recently upgraded to provide a paved roadway link with the isolated community of Whittier on Prince William Sound to the Seward Highway about 50 miles (80 km) southeast of Anchorage at Portage. At 2.5 miles (4.0 km), the tunnel was the longest road tunnel in North America until 2007.[120] The tunnel is the longest combination road and rail tunnel in North America. Rail An Alaska Railroad locomotive over a bridge in Girdwood approaching Anchorage (2007) The White Pass and Yukon Route traverses rugged terrain north of Skagway near the Canada–US border. Built around 1915, the Alaska Railroad (ARR) played a key role in the development of Alaska through the 20th century. It links north Pacific shipping through providing critical infrastructure with tracks that run from Seward to Interior Alaska by way of South Central Alaska, passing through Anchorage, Eklutna, Wasilla, Talkeetna, Denali, and Fairbanks, with spurs to Whittier, Palmer and North Pole. The cities, towns, villages, and region served by ARR tracks are known statewide as ""The Railbelt"". In recent years, the ever-improving paved highway system began to eclipse the railroad's importance in Alaska's economy. The railroad played a vital role in Alaska's development, moving freight into Alaska while transporting natural resources southward, such as coal from the Usibelli coal mine near Healy to Seward and gravel from the Matanuska Valley to Anchorage. It is well known for its summertime tour passenger service. The Alaska Railroad was one of the last railroads in North America to use cabooses in regular service and still uses them on some gravel trains. It continues to offer one of the last flag stop routes in the country. A stretch of about 60 miles (100 km) of track along an area north of Talkeetna remains inaccessible by road; the railroad provides the only transportation to rural homes and cabins in the area. Until construction of the Parks Highway in the 1970s, the railroad provided the only land access to most of the region along its entire route. In northern Southeast Alaska, the White Pass and Yukon Route also partly runs through the state from Skagway northwards into Canada (British Columbia and Yukon Territory), crossing the border at White Pass Summit. This line is now mainly used by tourists, often arriving by cruise liner at Skagway. It was featured in the 1983 BBC television series Great Little Railways. The Alaska Rail network is not connected to Outside. (The nearest link to the North American railway network is the northwest terminus of the Canadian National Railway at Prince Rupert, British Columbia, several hundred miles to the southeast.) In 2000, the U.S. Congress authorized $6 million to study the feasibility of a rail link between Alaska, Canada, and the lower 48.[121][122][123] Some private companies provides car float service between Whittier and Seattle. Marine transport Many cities, towns and villages in the state do not have road or highway access; the only modes of access involve travel by air, river, or the sea. The MV Tustumena (named after Tustumena Glacier) is one of the state's many ferries, providing service between the Kenai Peninsula, Kodiak Island and the Aleutian Chain. Alaska's well-developed state-owned ferry system (known as the Alaska Marine Highway) serves the cities of southeast, the Gulf Coast and the Alaska Peninsula. The ferries transport vehicles as well as passengers. The system also operates a ferry service from Bellingham, Washington and Prince Rupert, British Columbia, in Canada through the Inside Passage to Skagway. The Inter-Island Ferry Authority also serves as an important marine link for many communities in the Prince of Wales Island region of Southeast and works in concert with the Alaska Marine Highway. In recent years, cruise lines have created a summertime tourism market, mainly connecting the Pacific Northwest to Southeast Alaska and, to a lesser degree, towns along Alaska's gulf coast. The population of Ketchikan for example fluctuates dramatically on many days—up to four large cruise ships can dock there at the same time. Air transport Cities not served by road, sea, or river can be reached only by air, foot, dogsled, or snowmachine, accounting for Alaska's extremely well developed bush air services—an Alaskan novelty. Anchorage and, to a lesser extent Fairbanks, is served by many major airlines. Because of limited highway access, air travel remains the most efficient form of transportation in and out of the state. Anchorage recently completed extensive remodeling and construction at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport to help accommodate the upsurge in tourism (in 2012–2013, Alaska received almost two million visitors).[124] Regular flights to most villages and towns within the state that are commercially viable are challenging to provide, so they are heavily subsidized by the federal government through the Essential Air Service program. Alaska Airlines is the only major airline offering in-state travel with jet service (sometimes in combination cargo and passenger Boeing 737-400s) from Anchorage and Fairbanks to regional hubs like Bethel, Nome, Kotzebue, Dillingham, Kodiak, and other larger communities as well as to major Southeast and Alaska Peninsula communities. A Bombardier Dash 8, operated by Era Alaska, on approach to Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport The bulk of remaining commercial flight offerings come from small regional commuter airlines such as Ravn Alaska, PenAir, and Frontier Flying Service. The smallest towns and villages must rely on scheduled or chartered bush flying services using general aviation aircraft such as the Cessna Caravan, the most popular aircraft in use in the state. Much of this service can be attributed to the Alaska bypass mail program which subsidizes bulk mail delivery to Alaskan rural communities. The program requires 70% of that subsidy to go to carriers who offer passenger service to the communities. Many communities have small air taxi services. These operations originated from the demand for customized transport to remote areas. Perhaps the most quintessentially Alaskan plane is the bush seaplane. The world's busiest seaplane base is Lake Hood, located next to Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, where flights bound for remote villages without an airstrip carry passengers, cargo, and many items from stores and warehouse clubs. In 2006 Alaska had the highest number of pilots per capita of any U.S. state.[125] Other transport Another Alaskan transportation method is the dogsled. In modern times (that is, any time after the mid-late 1920s), dog mushing is more of a sport than a true means of transportation. Various races are held around the state, but the best known is the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, a 1,150-mile (1,850 km) trail from Anchorage to Nome (although the distance varies from year to year, the official distance is set at 1,049 miles or 1,688 km). The race commemorates the famous 1925 serum run to Nome in which mushers and dogs like Togo and Balto took much-needed medicine to the diphtheria-stricken community of Nome when all other means of transportation had failed. Mushers from all over the world come to Anchorage each March to compete for cash, prizes, and prestige. The ""Serum Run"" is another sled dog race that more accurately follows the route of the famous 1925 relay, leaving from the community of Nenana (southwest of Fairbanks) to Nome.[126] In areas not served by road or rail, primary transportation in summer is by all-terrain vehicle and in winter by snowmobile or ""snow machine"", as it is commonly referred to in Alaska.[127] Data transport Alaska's internet and other data transport systems are provided largely through the two major telecommunications companies: GCI and Alaska Communications. GCI owns and operates what it calls the Alaska United Fiber Optic system[128] and, as of late 2011, Alaska Communications advertised that it has ""two fiber optic paths to the lower 48 and two more across Alaska.[129] In January 2011, it was reported that a $1 billion project to connect Asia and rural Alaska was being planned, aided in part by $350 million in stimulus from the federal government.[130] Law and government State government Main article: Government of Alaska The center of state government in Juneau. The large buildings in the background are, from left to right: the Court Plaza Building (known colloquially as the ""Spam Can""), the State Office Building (behind), the Alaska Office Building, the John H. Dimond State Courthouse, and the Alaska State Capitol. Many of the smaller buildings in the foreground are also occupied by state government agencies. Like all other U.S. states, Alaska is governed as a republic, with three branches of government: an executive branch consisting of the governor of Alaska and his or her appointees which head executive departments; a legislative branch consisting of the Alaska House of Representatives and Alaska Senate; and a judicial branch consisting of the Alaska Supreme Court and lower courts. The state of Alaska employs approximately 16,000 people statewide.[131] The Alaska Legislature consists of a 40-member House of Representatives and a 20-member Senate. Senators serve four-year terms and House members two. The governor of Alaska serves four-year terms. The lieutenant governor runs separately from the governor in the primaries, but during the general election, the nominee for governor and nominee for lieutenant governor run together on the same ticket. Alaska's court system has four levels: the Alaska Supreme Court, the Alaska Court of Appeals, the superior courts and the district courts.[132] The superior and district courts are trial courts. Superior courts are courts of general jurisdiction, while district courts hear only certain types of cases, including misdemeanor criminal cases and civil cases valued up to $100,000.[132] The Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals are appellate courts. The Court of Appeals is required to hear appeals from certain lower-court decisions, including those regarding criminal prosecutions, juvenile delinquency, and habeas corpus.[132] The Supreme Court hears civil appeals and may in its discretion hear criminal appeals.[132] State politics Main article: Politics of Alaska Further information: Political party strength in Alaska and Alaska political corruption probe Gubernatorial election results[133] Year Democratic Republican Others 1958 59.6% 29,189 39.4% 19,299 1962 52.3% 29,627 47.7% 27,054 1966 48.4% 32,065 50.0% 33,145 1970 52.4% 42,309 46.1% 37,264 1974 47.4% 45,553 47.7% 45,840 1978 20.2% 25,656 39.1% 49,580 1982 46.1% 89,918 37.1% 72,291 1986 47.3% 84,943 42.6% 76,515 1990 30.9% 60,201 26.2% 50,991 38.9% 75,721[a] 1994 41.1% 87,693 40.8% 87,157 1998 51.3% 112,879 17.9% 39,331 2002 40.7% 94,216 55.9% 129,279 2006 41.0% 97,238 48.3% 114,697 2010 37.7% 96,519 59.1% 151,318 2014 0.0% 0 45.9% 128,435 48.1% 134,658[b] 2018 44.4% 125,739 51.4% 145,631 Although in its early years of statehood Alaska was a Democratic state, since the early 1970s it has been characterized as Republican-leaning.[134] Local political communities have often worked on issues related to land use development, fishing, tourism, and individual rights. Alaska Natives, while organized in and around their communities, have been active within the Native corporations. These have been given ownership over large tracts of land, which require stewardship. Alaska was formerly the only state in which possession of one ounce or less of marijuana in one's home was completely legal under state law, though the federal law remains in force.[135] The state has an independence movement favoring a vote on secession from the United States, with the Alaskan Independence Party.[136] Six Republicans and four Democrats have served as governor of Alaska. In addition, Republican governor Wally Hickel was elected to the office for a second term in 1990 after leaving the Republican party and briefly joining the Alaskan Independence Party ticket just long enough to be reelected. He officially rejoined the Republican party in 1994. Alaska's voter initiative making marijuana legal took effect on February 24, 2015, placing Alaska alongside Colorado and Washington as the first three U.S. states where recreational marijuana is legal. The new law means people over 21 can consume small amounts of cannabis.[137] The first legal marijuana store opened in Valdez in October 2016.[138] Voter registration Party registration as of August 3, 2021[139] Party Total voters Percentage Unaffiliated 340,731 57.37% Republican 144,186 24.28% Democratic 78,984 13.30% Alaskan Independence 18,923 3.19% Other political groups 11,092 1.87% Total 593,916 100% Taxes To finance state government operations, Alaska depends primarily on petroleum revenues and federal subsidies. This allows it to have the lowest individual tax burden in the United States.[140] It is one of five states with no sales tax, one of seven states with no individual income tax, and—along with New Hampshire—one of two that has neither.[141] The Department of Revenue Tax Division[142] reports regularly on the state's revenue sources. The Department also issues an annual summary of its operations, including new state laws that directly affect the tax division. In 2014 the Tax Foundation ranked Alaska as having the fourth most ""business friendly"" tax policy, behind only Wyoming, South Dakota, and Nevada.[143] While Alaska has no state sales tax, 89 municipalities collect a local sales tax, from 1.0 to 7.5%, typically 3–5%. Other local taxes levied include raw fish taxes, hotel, motel, and bed-and-breakfast 'bed' taxes, severance taxes, liquor and tobacco taxes, gaming (pull tabs) taxes, tire taxes and fuel transfer taxes. A part of the revenue collected from certain state taxes and license fees (such as petroleum, aviation motor fuel, telephone cooperative) is shared with municipalities in Alaska. The fall in oil prices after the fracking boom in the early 2010s has decimated Alaska's state treasury, which has historically received about 85 percent of its revenue from taxes and fees imposed on oil and gas companies.[144] The state government has had to drastically reduce its budget, and has brought its budget shortfall from over $2 billion in 2016 to under $500 million by 2018. In 2020, Alaska's state government budget was $4.8 billion, while projected government revenues were only $4.5 billion.[145] Federal politics Main article: Politics of Alaska See also: Arctic Policy of the United States A line graph showing the presidential vote by party from 1960 to 2016 in Alaska Alaska regularly supports Republicans in presidential elections and has done so since statehood. Republicans have won the state's electoral college votes in all but one election that it has participated in (1964). No state has voted for a Democratic presidential candidate fewer times. Alaska was carried by Democratic nominee Lyndon B. Johnson during his landslide election in 1964, while the 1960 and 1968 elections were close. Since 1972, however, Republicans have carried the state by large margins. In 2008, Republican John McCain defeated Democrat Barack Obama in Alaska, 59.49% to 37.83%. McCain's running mate was Sarah Palin, the state's governor and the first Alaskan on a major party ticket. Obama lost Alaska again in 2012, but he captured 40% of the state's vote in that election, making him the first Democrat to do so since 1968. The Alaska Bush, central Juneau, midtown and downtown Anchorage, and the areas surrounding the University of Alaska Fairbanks campus and Ester have been strongholds of the Democratic Party. The Matanuska-Susitna Borough, the majority of Fairbanks (including North Pole and the military base), and South Anchorage typically have the strongest Republican showing.

Discuss and resolve this issue before removing this message. (December 2020) See also: Ranked-choice voting in the United States and Nonpartisan blanket primary In the 2020 election cycle, Alaskan voters approved Ballot Measure 2.[146] The measure passed by a margin of 1.1%, or about 4,000 votes.[147] The measure requires campaigns to disclose the original source and any intermediaries for campaign contributions over $2,000. The measure establishes non-partisan blanket primaries for statewide elections (like in Washington state and California) and ranked-choice voting (like in Maine).[147] Alaska is the third state with jungle primaries for all statewide races, the second state with ranked voting, and the only state with both. The first race to use the new system of elections will be the 2022 Senate election in which Lisa Murkowski will run for re-election.

The organization holds Consultative Status II at the United Nations. To thrive in their circumpolar homeland, Inuit had the vision to realize they must speak with a united voice on issues of common concern and combine their energies and talents towards protecting and promoting their way of life. The principal goals of ICC are, therefore, to strengthen unity among Inuit of the circumpolar region; promote Inuit rights and interests on an international level; develop and encourage long-term policies that safeguard the Arctic environment; and seek full and active partnership in the political, economic, and social development of circumpolar regions. ICC holds a General Assembly every four years at which delegates from across the circumpolar region elect a new Chair and an executive council, develop policies, and adopt resolutions that will guide the activities of the organization for the coming term. The General Assembly is the heart of the organization, providing an opportunity for sharing information, discussing common concerns, debating issues, and strengthening the bonds between all Inuit. Representatives from the Inuit Circumpolar Youth Council and the International Elders Council attend, thereby improving communications and creating synergies with these important affiliated organizations. In 2006 at the ICC General Assembly, held in Barrow, Alaska, ICC was instructed to “annually proclaim November 7th, the birth date of ICC visionary, Eben Hopson, Sr., as Inuit Day, and to urge all Inuit governments, agencies, and communities to annually proclaim this day as Inuit Day, and conduct appropriate ceremonies and celebrations.” Get in Touch Name Email Address Message 2 + 4 = Submit ICC Canada Office 75 Albert Street, Suite 1001Ottawa, OntarioCanadaK1P 5E7 +1 613 563 2642Email: icc@inuitcircumpolar.com FollowFollowFollowFollow © Inuit Circumpolar Council Canada, All Rights Reserved",Inuit Circumpolar Conference

Greenland is an autonomous territory[13] within the Kingdom of Denmark. Though physiographically a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe (specifically Norway and Denmark, the colonial powers) for more than a millennium, beginning in 986.[14] The majority of its residents are Inuit, whose ancestors migrated from Alaska through Northern Canada, gradually settling across the island by the 13th century.[15] Today, the population is concentrated mainly on the southwest coast, while the rest of the island is sparsely populated. Greenland is divided into five municipalities – Sermersooq, Kujalleq, Qeqertalik, Qeqqata, and Avannaata. It has two unincorporated areas – the Northeast Greenland National Park and the Thule Air Base. The latter, while under Danish control, is administered by the United States Air Force.[16] Three-quarters of Greenland is covered by the only permanent ice sheet outside of Antarctica. With a population of 56,081 (2020),[7] it is the least densely populated region in the world.[17] About a third of the population lives in Nuuk, the capital and largest city; the second-largest city in terms of population is Sisimiut, 320 kilometres (200 mi) north of Nuuk. The Arctic Umiaq Line ferry acts as a lifeline for western Greenland, connecting the various cities and settlements. Greenland has been inhabited at intervals over at least the last 4,500 years by Arctic peoples whose forebears migrated there from what is now Canada.[18][19] Norsemen settled the uninhabited southern part of Greenland beginning in the 10th century, having previously settled Iceland. These Norsemen later set sail from Greenland and Iceland, with Leif Erikson becoming the first known European to reach North America nearly 500 years before Columbus reached the Caribbean islands. Inuit peoples arrived in the 13th century. Though under continuous influence of Norway and Norwegians, Greenland was not formally under the Norwegian crown until 1261. The Norse colonies disappeared in the late 15th century after Norway was hit by the Black Death and entered a severe decline. Soon after their demise, beginning in 1499, the Portuguese briefly explored and claimed the island, naming it Terra do Lavrador (later applied to Labrador in Canada).[20] In the early 17th century, Danish explorers reached Greenland again. To strengthen trading and power, Denmark–Norway affirmed sovereignty over the island. Because of Norway's weak status, it lost sovereignty over Greenland in 1814 when the union was dissolved. Greenland became Danish in 1814 and was fully integrated in Denmark in 1953 organised in the Danish constitution. With the Constitution of 1953, the people in Greenland became citizens of Denmark. From 1961 Greenland joined the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), which Denmark joined as a founding member of the EFTA in 1960, but its membership ceased with effect from 1973 when Denmark joined the European Communities. In 1973, Greenland joined the European Economic Community (EEC) with Denmark. However, in a referendum in 1982, a majority of the population voted for Greenland to withdraw from the EEC. This was effected in 1985, changing Greenland to an OCT (Overseas Countries and Territories) associated with the EEC, now the European Union (EU). The associated relationship with the EU also means that all Greenlandic nationals (OCT-nationals) are EU citizens.[21] Greenland contains the world's largest and northernmost national park, Northeast Greenland National Park (Kalaallit Nunaanni nuna eqqissisimatitaq). Established in 1974 and expanded to its present size in 1988, it protects 972,001 square kilometres (375,292 sq mi) of the interior and northeastern coast of Greenland and is bigger than all but twenty-nine countries in the world. In 1979, Denmark granted home rule to Greenland; in 2008, Greenlanders voted in favour of the Self-Government Act, which transferred more power from the Danish government to the local Greenlandic government.[22] Under the new structure, Greenland has gradually assumed responsibility for policing, the judicial system, company law, accounting, auditing, mineral resource activities, aviation, law of legal capacity, family law and succession law, aliens and border controls, the working environment, and financial regulation and supervision. The Danish government still retains control of monetary policy and foreign affairs including defence. It also provided an initial annual subsidy of DKK 3.4 billion, that will diminish gradually. Greenland expects to grow its economy based on increased income from the extraction of natural resources. The capital, Nuuk, held the 2016 Arctic Winter Games. At 70%, Greenland has one of the highest shares of renewable energy in the world, mostly coming from hydropower.[23] Contents 1 Etymology 2 History 2.1 Early Paleo-Inuit cultures 2.2 Norse settlement 2.3 Thule culture (1300–present) 2.4 1500–1814 2.5 Treaty of Kiel to World War II 2.6 Home rule and self-rule 3 Tourism 4 Geography and climate 4.1 Climate change 4.2 Geology 5 Biodiversity 6 Politics 6.1 Political system 6.2 Government 6.3 Military 6.4 Administrative divisions 7 Economy 7.1 Transport 8 Population 8.1 Demographics 8.2 Languages 8.3 Education 8.4 Religion 8.5 Social issues 9 Culture 9.1 Music 9.2 Sport 9.3 Cuisine 9.4 Media 9.5 Fine arts 10 See also 10.1 Other similar territories 11 Notes 12 References 12.1 Bibliography 12.2 Works cited 13 External links Etymology The early Norse settlers named the island as Greenland. In the Icelandic sagas, the Norwegian-born Icelander Erik the Red was said to be exiled from Iceland for manslaughter. Along with his extended family and his thralls (i.e. slaves or serfs), he set out in ships to explore an icy land known to lie to the northwest. After finding a habitable area and settling there, he named it Grœnland (translated as ""Greenland""), supposedly in the hope that the pleasant name would attract settlers.[24][25][26] The Saga of Erik the Red states: ""In the summer, Erik left to settle in the country he had found, which he called Greenland, as he said people would be attracted there if it had a favorable name.""[27] The name of the country in the indigenous Greenlandic language is Kalaallit Nunaat (""land of the Kalaallit"").[28] The Kalaallit are the indigenous Greenlandic Inuit people who inhabit the country's western region. History Main article: History of Greenland Early Paleo-Inuit cultures Areas of Independence I and Independence II cultures around Independence Fjord In prehistoric times, Greenland was home to several successive Paleo-Inuit cultures known today primarily through archaeological finds. The earliest entry of the Paleo-Inuit into Greenland is thought to have occurred about 2500 BC. From around 2500 BC to 800 BC, southern and western Greenland were inhabited by the Saqqaq culture. Most finds of Saqqaq-period archaeological remains have been around Disko Bay, including the site of Saqqaq, after which the culture is named.[29][30] From 2400 BC to 1300 BC, the Independence I culture existed in northern Greenland. It was a part of the Arctic small tool tradition.[31][32][33] Towns, including Deltaterrasserne, started to appear. Around 800 BC, the Saqqaq culture disappeared and the Early Dorset culture emerged in western Greenland and the Independence II culture in northern Greenland.[34] The Dorset culture was the first culture to extend throughout the Greenlandic coastal areas, both on the west and east coasts. It lasted until the total onset of the Thule culture in 1500 AD. The Dorset culture population lived primarily from hunting of whales and caribou.[35][36][37][38] Norse settlement The Kingittorsuaq Runestone from Kingittorsuaq Island (Middle Ages) From 986, Greenland's west coast was settled by Icelanders and Norwegians, through a contingent of 14 boats led by Erik the Red. They formed three settlements – known as the Eastern Settlement, the Western Settlement and the Middle Settlement – on fjords near the southwesternmost tip of the island.[14][39] They shared the island with the late Dorset culture inhabitants who occupied the northern and western parts, and later with the Thule culture that entered from the north. Norse Greenlanders submitted to Norwegian rule in 1261 under the Kingdom of Norway. Later the Kingdom of Norway entered into a personal union with Denmark in 1380 and from 1397 was a part of the Kalmar Union.[40] The Norse settlements, such as Brattahlíð, thrived for centuries but disappeared sometime in the 15th century, perhaps at the onset of the Little Ice Age.[41] Apart from some runic inscriptions, no contemporary records or historiography survives from the Norse settlements. Medieval Norwegian sagas and historical works mention Greenland's economy as well as the bishops of Gardar and the collection of tithes. A chapter in the Konungs skuggsjá (The King's Mirror) describes Norse Greenland's exports and imports as well as grain cultivation. One of the last contemporary written mentions of the Norse Greenlanders records a marriage which took place in 1408 in the church of Hvalsey – today the best-preserved Nordic ruins in Greenland. Icelandic saga accounts of life in Greenland were composed in the 13th century and later, and do not constitute primary sources for the history of early Norse Greenland.[26] Modern understanding therefore mostly depends on the physical data from archeological sites. Interpretation of ice core and clam shell data suggests that between 800 and 1300 AD, the regions around the fjords of southern Greenland experienced a relatively mild climate several degrees Celsius higher than usual in the North Atlantic,[42] with trees and herbaceous plants growing, and livestock being farmed. Barley was grown as a crop up to the 70th parallel.[43] The ice cores indicate Greenland has had dramatic temperature shifts many times over the past 100,000 years.[44] Similarly the Icelandic Book of Settlements records famines during the winters, in which ""the old and helpless were killed and thrown over cliffs"".[42] Ingibjørg Tombstone. These Icelandic settlements vanished during the 14th and early 15th centuries.[45] The demise of the Western Settlement coincides with a decrease in summer and winter temperatures. A study of North Atlantic seasonal temperature variability during the Little Ice Age showed a significant decrease in maximum summer temperatures beginning in the late 13th century to early 14th century – as much as 6 to 8 °C (11 to 14 °F) lower than modern summer temperatures.[46] The study also found that the lowest winter temperatures of the last 2,000 years occurred in the late 14th century and early 15th century. The Eastern Settlement was likely abandoned in the early to mid-15th century, during this cold period. Theories drawn from archeological excavations at Herjolfsnes in the 1920s suggest that the condition of human bones from this period indicates that the Norse population was malnourished, possibly because of soil erosion resulting from the Norsemen's destruction of natural vegetation in the course of farming, turf-cutting, and wood-cutting. Malnutrition may also have resulted from widespread deaths from pandemic plague;[47] the decline in temperatures during the Little Ice Age; and armed conflicts with the Skrælings (Norse word for Inuit, meaning ""wretches""[41]). Recent archeological studies somewhat challenge the general assumption that the Norse colonisation had a dramatic negative environmental effect on the vegetation. Data support traces of a possible Norse soil amendment strategy.[48] More recent evidence suggests that the Norse, who never numbered more than about 2,500, gradually abandoned the Greenland settlements over the 15th century as walrus ivory,[49] the most valuable export from Greenland, decreased in price because of competition with other sources of higher-quality ivory, and that there was actually little evidence of starvation or difficulties.[50] Other theories about the disappearance of the Norse settlement have been proposed; Lack of support from the homeland.[47] Ship-borne marauders (such as Basque, English, or German pirates) rather than Skrælings, could have plundered and displaced the Greenlanders.[51] They were ""the victims of hidebound thinking and of a hierarchical society dominated by the Church and the biggest land owners. In their reluctance to see themselves as anything but Europeans, the Greenlanders failed to adopt the kind of apparel that the Inuit employed as protection against the cold and damp or to borrow any of the Inuit hunting gear.""[14][41] ""Norse society's structure created a conflict between the short-term interests of those in power, and the long-term interests of the society as a whole.""[41] Thule culture (1300–present) Pictures of Greenland, c. 1863 The Thule people are the ancestors of the current Greenlandic population. No genes from the Paleo-Inuit have been found in the present population of Greenland.[52] The Thule culture migrated eastward from what is now known as Alaska around 1000 AD, reaching Greenland around 1300. The Thule culture was the first to introduce to Greenland such technological innovations as dog sleds and toggling harpoons. 1500–1814 In 1500, King Manuel I of Portugal sent Gaspar Corte-Real to Greenland in search of a Northwest Passage to Asia which, according to the Treaty of Tordesillas, was part of Portugal's sphere of influence. In 1501, Corte-Real returned with his brother, Miguel Corte-Real. Finding the sea frozen, they headed south and arrived in Labrador and Newfoundland. Upon the brothers' return to Portugal, the cartographic information supplied by Corte-Real was incorporated into a new map of the world which was presented to Ercole I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, by Alberto Cantino in 1502. The Cantino planisphere, made in Lisbon, accurately depicts the southern coastline of Greenland.[53] An English map of 1747, based on Hans Egede's descriptions and misconceptions, by Emanuel Bowen In 1605–1607, King Christian IV of Denmark sent a series of expeditions to Greenland and Arctic waterways to locate the lost eastern Norse settlement and assert Danish sovereignty over Greenland. The expeditions were mostly unsuccessful, partly due to leaders who lacked experience with the difficult Arctic ice and weather conditions, and partly because the expedition leaders were given instructions to search for the Eastern Settlement on the east coast of Greenland just north of Cape Farewell, which is almost inaccessible due to southward drifting ice. The pilot on all three trips was English explorer James Hall. Godthåb in Greenland, c. 1878 After the Norse settlements died off, Greenland came under the de facto control of various Inuit groups, but the Danish government never forgot or relinquished the claims to Greenland that it had inherited from the Norse. When it re-established contact with Greenland in the early 17th century, Denmark asserted its sovereignty over the island. In 1721, a joint mercantile and clerical expedition led by Danish-Norwegian missionary Hans Egede was sent to Greenland, not knowing whether a Norse civilization remained there. This expedition is part of the Dano-Norwegian colonization of the Americas. After 15 years in Greenland, Hans Egede left his son Paul Egede in charge of the mission there and returned to Denmark, where he established a Greenland Seminary. This new colony was centred at Godthåb (""Good Hope"") on the southwest coast. Gradually, Greenland was opened up to Danish merchants, but closed to those from other countries. Treaty of Kiel to World War II Main article: Greenland in World War II 1869 photograph of Greenlandic Inuit. When the union between the crowns of Denmark and Norway was dissolved in 1814, the Treaty of Kiel severed Norway's former colonies and left them under the control of the Danish monarch. Norway occupied then-uninhabited eastern Greenland as Erik the Red's Land in July 1931, claiming that it constituted terra nullius. Norway and Denmark agreed to submit the matter in 1933 to the Permanent Court of International Justice, which decided against Norway.[54] Greenland's connection to Denmark was severed on 9 April 1940, early in World War II, after Denmark was occupied by Nazi Germany. On 8 April 1941, the United States occupied Greenland to defend it against a possible invasion by Germany.[55] The United States occupation of Greenland continued until 1945. Greenland was able to buy goods from the United States and Canada by selling cryolite from the mine at Ivittuut. The major air bases were Bluie West-1 at Narsarsuaq and Bluie West-8 at Søndre Strømfjord (Kangerlussuaq), both of which are still used as Greenland's major international airports. Bluie was the military code name for Greenland. Map of Eirik Raudes Land During this war, the system of government changed: Governor Eske Brun ruled the island under a law of 1925 that allowed governors to take control under extreme circumstances; Governor Aksel Svane was transferred to the United States to lead the commission to supply Greenland. The Danish Sirius Patrol guarded the northeastern shores of Greenland in 1942 using dogsleds. They detected several German weather stations and alerted American troops, who destroyed the facilities. After the collapse of the Third Reich, Albert Speer briefly considered escaping in a small aeroplane to hide out in Greenland, but changed his mind and decided to surrender to the United States Armed Forces.[56] Greenland had been a protected and very isolated society until 1940. The Danish government had maintained a strict monopoly of Greenlandic trade, allowing no more than small scale barter trading with British whalers. In wartime Greenland developed a sense of self-reliance through self-government and independent communication with the outside world. Despite this change, in 1946 a commission including the highest Greenlandic council, the Landsrådene, recommended patience and no radical reform of the system. Two years later, the first step towards a change of government was initiated when a grand commission was established. A final report (G-50) was presented in 1950, which recommended the introduction of a modern welfare state with Denmark's development as sponsor and model. In 1953, Greenland was made an equal part of the Danish Kingdom. Home rule was granted in 1979. Home rule and self-rule See also: Greenlandic independence The orthography and vocabulary of the Greenlandic language is governed by Oqaasileriffik, the Greenlandic language secretariat, located in the Ilimmarfik University of Greenland, Nuuk. Following World War II, the United States developed a geopolitical interest in Greenland, and in 1946 the United States offered to buy the island from Denmark for $100,000,000. Denmark refused to sell it.[57][58] Historically this repeated an interest by Secretary of State William H. Seward. In 1867 he worked with former senator Robert J. Walker to explore the possibility of buying Greenland and perhaps Iceland. Opposition in Congress ended this project.[59] In the 21st century, the United States, according to WikiLeaks, remains interested in investing in the resource base of Greenland and in tapping hydrocarbons off the Greenlandic coast.[60][61] In August 2019, the American president Donald Trump again proposed to buy the country, prompting premier Kim Kielsen to issue the statement, ""Greenland is not for sale and cannot be sold, but Greenland is open for trade and cooperation with other countries – including the United States.""[62] In 1950, Denmark agreed to allow the US to regain the use of Thule Air Base; it was greatly expanded between 1951 and 1953 as part of a unified NATO Cold War defense strategy. The local population of three nearby villages was moved more than 100 kilometres (62 mi) away in the winter. The United States tried to construct a subterranean network of secret nuclear missile launch sites in the Greenlandic ice cap, named Project Iceworm. According to documents declassified in 1996,[63] this project was managed from Camp Century from 1960 to 1966 before abandonment as unworkable.[64] The missiles were never fielded and necessary consent from the Danish Government to do so was never sought. The Danish government did not become aware of the program's mission until 1997, when they discovered it while looking, in the declassified documents, for records related to the crash of a nuclear equipped B-52 bomber at Thule in 1968.[65] The United States has operated Thule Air Base since the 1950s. With the 1953 Danish constitution, Greenland's colonial status ended as the island was incorporated into the Danish realm as an amt (county). Danish citizenship was extended to Greenlanders. Danish policies toward Greenland consisted of a strategy of cultural assimilation – or de-Greenlandification. During this period, the Danish government promoted the exclusive use of the Danish language in official matters, and required Greenlanders to go to Denmark for their post-secondary education. Many Greenlandic children grew up in boarding schools in southern Denmark, and a number lost their cultural ties to Greenland. While the policies ""succeeded"" in the sense of shifting Greenlanders from being primarily subsistence hunters into being urbanized wage earners, the Greenlandic elite began to reassert a Greenlandic cultural identity. A movement developed in favour of independence, reaching its peak in the 1970s.[66] As a consequence of political complications in relation to Denmark's entry into the European Common Market in 1972, Denmark began to seek a different status for Greenland, resulting in the Home Rule Act of 1979. Sermiligaaq. Greenland has more than 60 settlements. This gave Greenland limited autonomy with its own legislature taking control of some internal policies, while the Parliament of Denmark maintained full control of external policies, security, and natural resources. The law came into effect on 1 May 1979. The Queen of Denmark, Margrethe II, remains Greenland's head of state. In 1985, Greenland left the European Economic Community (EEC) upon achieving self-rule, as it did not agree with the EEC's commercial fishing regulations and an EEC ban on seal skin products.[67] Greenland voters approved a referendum on greater autonomy on 25 November 2008.[68][69] According to one study, the 2008 vote created what ""can be seen as a system between home rule and full independence.""[70] On 21 June 2009, Greenland gained self-rule with provisions for assuming responsibility for self-government of judicial affairs, policing, and natural resources. Also, Greenlanders were recognized as a separate people under international law.[71] Denmark maintains control of foreign affairs and defence matters. Denmark upholds the annual block grant of 3.2 billion Danish kroner, but as Greenland begins to collect revenues of its natural resources, the grant will gradually be diminished. This is generally considered to be a step toward eventual full independence from Denmark.[72] Greenlandic was declared the sole official language of Greenland at the historic ceremony.[2][4][73][74][75] Tourism Main article: Tourism in Greenland Tourism increased significantly between 2010 and 2019, with the number of visitors increasing from 460,000 per year to 2 million. Condé Nast Traveler describes that high level as ""overtourism"". One source estimated that in 2019 the revenue from this aspect of the economy was about 450 million kroner (US$67 million). Like many aspects of the economy, this slowed dramatically in 2020, and into 2021, due to restrictions required as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic;[76] one source describes it as being the ""biggest economic victim of the coronavirus"". (The overall economy did not suffer too severely as of mid 2020, thanks to the fisheries ""and a hefty subsidy from Copenhagen"".)[77] Visitors will begin arriving again in late 2020 or early 2021. Greenland's goal is to develop it ""right"" and to ""build a more sustainable tourism for the long run"".[78] Geography and climate Main article: Geography of Greenland See also: Administrative divisions of Greenland, Territorial claims in the Arctic, and Climate of the Arctic § Greenland Map of Greenland Greenland bedrock, at current elevation above sea level Greenland is the world's largest non-continental island[79] and the third largest area in North America after Canada and the United States.[80] It is between latitudes 59° and 83°N, and longitudes 11° and 74°W. Greenland is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Greenland Sea to the east, the North Atlantic Ocean to the southeast, the Davis Strait to the southwest, Baffin Bay to the west, the Nares Strait and Lincoln Sea to the northwest. The nearest countries are Canada, to the west and southwest across Nares Strait and Baffin Bay; and Iceland, southeast of Greenland in the Atlantic Ocean. Greenland also contains the world's largest national park, and it is the largest dependent territory by area in the world, as well as the fourth largest country subdivision in the world, after Sakha Republic in Russia, Australia's state of Western Australia, and Russia's Krasnoyarsk Krai, and the largest in North America. The lowest temperature ever recorded in the Northern Hemisphere was recorded in Greenland, near the topographic summit of the Greenland Ice Sheet, on 22 December 1991, when the temperature reached −69.6 °C (−93.3 °F).[81] In Nuuk, the average daily temperature varies over the seasons from −5.1 to 9.9 °C (23 to 50 °F)[82] The total area of Greenland is 2,166,086 km2 (836,330 sq mi) (including other offshore minor islands), of which the Greenland ice sheet covers 1,755,637 km2 (677,855 sq mi) (81%) and has a volume of approximately 2,850,000 km3 (680,000 cu mi).[83] The highest point on Greenland is Gunnbjørn Fjeld at 3,700 m (12,139 ft) of the Watkins Range (East Greenland mountain range). The majority of Greenland, however, is less than 1,500 m (4,921 ft) in elevation. The weight of the ice sheet has depressed the central land area to form a basin lying more than 300 m (984 ft) below sea level,[84][85] while elevations rise suddenly and steeply near the coast.[86] The ice flows generally to the coast from the centre of the island. A survey led by French scientist Paul-Emile Victor in 1951 concluded that, under the ice sheet, Greenland is composed of three large islands.[87] This is disputed, but if it is so, they would be separated by narrow straits, reaching the sea at Ilulissat Icefjord, at Greenland's Grand Canyon and south of Nordostrundingen. All towns and settlements of Greenland are situated along the ice-free coast, with the population being concentrated along the west coast. The northeastern part of Greenland is not part of any municipality, but it is the site of the world's largest national park, Northeast Greenland National Park.[88] At least four scientific expedition stations and camps had been established on the ice sheet in the ice-covered central part of Greenland (indicated as pale blue in the adjacent map): Eismitte, North Ice, North GRIP Camp and The Raven Skiway. There is a year-round station Summit Camp on the ice sheet, established in 1989. The radio station Jørgen Brønlund Fjord was, until 1950, the northernmost permanent outpost in the world. The extreme north of Greenland, Peary Land, is not covered by an ice sheet, because the air there is too dry to produce snow, which is essential in the production and maintenance of an ice sheet. If the Greenland ice sheet were to melt away completely, the world's sea level would rise by more than 7 m (23 ft).[89] In 2003, a small island, 35 by 15 metres (115 by 49 feet) in length and width, was discovered by arctic explorer Dennis Schmitt and his team at the coordinates of 83-42. Whether this island is permanent is not yet confirmed. If it is, it is the northernmost permanent known land on Earth. In 2007, the existence of a new island was announced. Named ""Uunartoq Qeqertaq"" (English: Warming Island), this island has always been present off the coast of Greenland, but was covered by a glacier. This glacier was discovered in 2002 to be shrinking rapidly, and by 2007 had completely melted away, leaving the exposed island.[90] The island was named Place of the Year by the Oxford Atlas of the World in 2007.[91] Ben Keene, the atlas's editor, commented: ""In the last two or three decades, global warming has reduced the size of glaciers throughout the Arctic and earlier this year, news sources confirmed what climate scientists already knew: water, not rock, lay beneath this ice bridge on the east coast of Greenland. More islets are likely to appear as the sheet of frozen water covering the world's largest island continues to melt"".[92] Some controversy surrounds the history of the island, specifically over whether the island might have been revealed during a brief warm period in Greenland during the mid-20th century.[93] Climate change See also: Climate change in the Arctic, Retreat of glaciers since 1850 § Greenland, and Greenland's Grand Canyon Between 1989 and 1993, US and European climate researchers drilled into the summit of Greenland's ice sheet, obtaining a pair of 3 km (1.9 mi) long ice cores. Analysis of the layering and chemical composition of the cores has provided a revolutionary new record of climate change in the Northern Hemisphere going back about 100,000 years and illustrated that the world's weather and temperature have often shifted rapidly from one seemingly stable state to another, with worldwide consequences.[94] The glaciers of Greenland are also contributing to a rise in the global sea level faster than was previously believed.[95] Between 1991 and 2004, monitoring of the weather at one location (Swiss Camp) showed that the average winter temperature had risen almost 6 °C (11 °F).[96] Other research has shown that higher snowfalls from the North Atlantic oscillation caused the interior of the ice cap to thicken by an average of 6 cm or 2.36 in each year between 1994 and 2005.[97] In 2021 Greenland banned all new oil and gas exploration in its territory. The government of Greenland explained the decision as follows: ""price of oil extraction is too high,""[98] In 2021, rain fell on the summit of Greenland's ice cap for the first time in recorded history, which scientists attributed to climate change.[99][100] Geology The island was part of the very ancient Precambrian continent of Laurentia, the eastern core of which forms the Greenland Shield, while the less exposed coastal strips become a plateau. On these ice-free coastal strips are sediments formed in the Precambrian, overprinted by metamorphism and now formed by glaciers, which continue into the Cenozoic and Mesozoic in parts of the island. In the east and west of Greenland there are remnants of flood basalts. Notable rock provinces (metamorphic igneous rocks, ultramafics and anorthosites) are found on the southwest coast at Qeqertarsuatsiaat. East of Nuuk, the banded iron ore region of Isukasia, over three billion years old, contains the world's oldest rocks, such as greenlandite (a rock composed predominantly of hornblende and hyperthene), formed 3.8 billion years ago,[101] and nuummite. In southern Greenland, the Illimaussaq alkaline complex consists of pegmatites such as nepheline, syenites (especially kakortokite or naujaite) and sodalite (sodalite-foya). In Ivittuut, where cryolite was formerly mined, there are fluoride-bearing pegmatites. To the north of Igaliku, there are the Gardar alkaline pegmatitic intrusions of augite syenite, gabbro, etc. To the west and southwest are Palaeozoic carbonatite complexes at Kangerlussuaq (Gardiner complex) and Safartoq, and basic and ultrabasic igneous rocks at Uiffaq on Disko Island, where there are masses of heavy native iron up to 25 tonnes (28 short tons) in the basalts.[102] Biodiversity See also: Flora and fauna of Greenland, Reindeer hunting in Greenland, Fishing industry in Greenland, and Whaling § Greenland Muskoxen in Greenland Greenland is home to two ecoregions: Kalaallit Nunaat high arctic tundra and Kalaallit Nunaat low arctic tundra.[103] There are approximately 700 known species of insects in Greenland, which is low compared with other countries (over one million species have been described worldwide). The sea is rich in fish and invertebrates, especially in the milder West Greenland Current; a large part of the Greenland fauna is associated with marine-based food chains, including large colonies of seabirds. The few native land mammals in Greenland include the polar bear, reindeer (introduced by Europeans), arctic fox, arctic hare, musk ox, collared lemming, ermine, and arctic wolf. The last four are found naturally only in East Greenland, having immigrated from Ellesmere Island. There are dozens of species of seals and whales along the coast. Land fauna consists predominantly of animals which have spread from North America or, in the case of many birds and insects, from Europe. There are no native or free-living reptiles or amphibians on the island.[104] Phytogeographically, Greenland belongs to the Arctic province of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom. The island is sparsely populated in vegetation; plant life consists mainly of grassland and small shrubs, which are regularly grazed by livestock. The most common tree native to Greenland is the European white birch (Betula pubescens) along with gray-leaf willow (Salix glauca), rowan (Sorbus aucuparia), common juniper (Juniperus communis) and other smaller trees, mainly willows. Greenland's flora consists of about 500 species of ""higher"" plants, i.e. flowering plants, ferns, horsetails and lycopodiophyta. Of the other groups, the lichens are the most diverse, with about 950 species; there are 600–700 species of fungi; mosses and bryophytes are also found. Most of Greenland's higher plants have circumpolar or circumboreal distributions; only a dozen species of saxifrage and hawkweed are endemic. A few plant species were introduced by the Norsemen, such as cow vetch. The Greenland Dog was brought from Siberia 1,000 years ago. The terrestrial vertebrates of Greenland include the Greenland dog, which was introduced by the Inuit, as well as European-introduced species such as Greenlandic sheep, goats, cattle, reindeer, horse, chicken and sheepdog, all descendants of animals imported by Europeans.[citation needed] Marine mammals include the hooded seal (Cystophora cristata) as well as the grey seal (Halichoerus grypus).[105] Whales frequently pass very close to Greenland's shores in the late summer and early autumn. Whale species include the beluga whale, blue whale, Greenland whale, fin whale, humpback whale, minke whale, narwhal, pilot whale, sperm whale.[106] As of 2009, 269 species of fish from over 80 different families are known from the waters surrounding Greenland. Almost all are marine species with only a few in freshwater, notably Atlantic salmon and charr.[107] The fishing industry is the primary industry of Greenland's economy, accounting for the majority of the country's total exports.[108] Birds, particularly seabirds, are an important part of Greenland's animal life; breeding populations of auks, puffins, skuas, and kittiwakes are found on steep mountainsides.[citation needed] Greenland's ducks and geese include common eider, long-tailed duck, king eider, white-fronted goose, pink-footed goose and barnacle goose. Breeding migratory birds include the snow bunting, lapland bunting, ringed plover, red-throated loon and red-necked phalarope. Non-migratory land birds include the arctic redpoll, ptarmigan, short-eared owl, snowy owl, gyrfalcon and white-tailed eagle.[104] Politics Main article: Politics of Greenland See also: 2021 Greenlandic general election, Greenland and the European Union, and Politics of Denmark Margrethe II, Queen of DenmarkPrime Minister Mette FrederiksenPremier Múte Bourup Egede The special territories of the European Union (pre 31 January 2020) Nuuk is Greenland's capital and the seat of the government. The Greenlandic government holds executive power in local government affairs. The head of the government is called Naalakkersuisut Siulittaasuat (""Premier"") and serves as head of Greenlandic Government. Any other member of the cabinet is called a Naalakkersuisoq (""Minister""). The Greenlandic parliament – the Inatsisartut (""Legislators""). The parliament currently has 31 members.[109] In contemporary times, elections are held at municipal, national (Inatsisartut), and kingdom (Folketing) levels. Greenland is a self-governing entity within the constitutional monarchy of the Kingdom of Denmark, in which Queen Margrethe II is the head of state. The monarch officially retains executive power and presides over the Council of State (privy council).[110][111] However, following the introduction of a parliamentary system of government, the duties of the monarch have since become strictly representative and ceremonial,[112] such as the formal appointment and dismissal of the prime minister and other ministers in the executive government. The monarch is not answerable for his or her actions, and the monarch's person is sacrosanct.[113] Political system The party system is dominated by the social-democratic Forward Party, and the democratic socialist Inuit Community Party, both of which broadly argue for greater independence from Denmark. While the 2009 election saw the unionist Democrat Party (two MPs) decline greatly, the 2013 election consolidated the power of the two main parties at the expense of the smaller groups, and saw the eco-socialist Inuit Party elected to the Parliament for the first time. The dominance of the Forward and Inuit Community parties began to wane after the snap 2014 and 2018 elections. The non-binding 2008 referendum on self-governance favoured increased self-governance by 21,355 votes to 6,663. In 1985, Greenland left the European Economic Community (EEC), unlike Denmark, which remains a member. The EEC later became the European Union (EU, renamed and expanded in scope in 1992). Greenland retains some ties through its associated relationship with the EU. However, EU law largely does not apply to Greenland except in the area of trade. Greenland is designated as a member of the Overseas Countries and Territories (OCT) and is thus officially not a part of the European Union, though Greenland can and does receive support from the European Development Fund, Multiannual Financial Framework, European Investment Bank and EU Programs.[114][115] Government Main article: Politics of Greenland Municipalities of Greenland Greenland's head of state is Queen Margrethe II of Denmark. The Queen's government in Denmark appoints a high commissioner (Rigsombudsmand) to represent it on the island. The commissioner is Mikaela Engell. The Greenland constituency elect two MP representatives to the Kingdom Parliament (Folketinget) in Denmark, out of a total of 179. The current representatives are Aki-Matilda Høegh-Dam of the Siumut Party and Aaja Chemnitz Larsen of the Inuit Community Party.[116] Greenland has national Parliament that consists of 31 representatives. The government is the Naalakkersuisut whose members are appointed by the premier. The head of government is the premier, usually the leader of the majority party in Parliament. The premier is Muté Bourup Egede of the Inuit Ataqatigiit party.[117] Military Main article: Military of Greenland Several American and Danish military bases are located in Greenland, including Thule Air Base, which is home to the United States Space Force's global network of sensors providing missile warning, space surveillance and space control to North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). Elements of the sensor systems are commanded and controlled variously by Space Delta's 2, 4, and 6.[118] In 1995, a political scandal in Denmark occurred after a report revealed the government had given tacit permission for nuclear weapons to be located in Greenland, in contravention of Denmark's 1957 nuclear-free zone policy.[119][65] The United States built a secret nuclear powered base, called Camp Century, in the Greenland ice sheet.[120] On 21 January 1968, a B-52G, with four nuclear bombs aboard as part of Operation Chrome Dome, crashed on the ice of the North Star Bay while attempting an emergency landing at Thule Air Base.[121] The resulting fire caused extensive radioactive contamination.[122] One of the H-bombs remains lost.[123][124] Administrative divisions Main article: Administrative divisions of Greenland Formerly consisting of three counties comprising a total of 18 municipalities, Greenland abolished these in 2009 and has since been divided into large territories known as ""municipalities"" (Greenlandic: kommuneqarfiit, Danish: kommuner): Sermersooq (""Much Ice"") around the capital Nuuk and also including all East Coast communities; Kujalleq (""South"") around Cape Farewell; Qeqqata (""Centre"") north of the capital along the Davis Strait; Qeqertalik (""The one with islands"") surrounding Disko Bay; and Avannaata (""Northern"") in the northwest; the latter two having come into being as a result of the Qaasuitsup municipality, one of the original four, being partitioned in 2018. The northeast of the island composes the unincorporated Northeast Greenland National Park. Thule Air Base is also unincorporated, an enclave within Avannaata municipality administered by the United States Air Force. During its construction, there were as many as 12,000 American residents but in recent years the number has been below 1,000. Economy Main article: Economy of Greenland A proportional representation of Greenland exports, 2019 Greenland electricity production by source The Greenlandic economy is highly dependent on fishing. Fishing accounts for more than 90% of Greenland's exports.[125] The shrimp and fish industry is by far the largest income earner.[126] Greenland is abundant in minerals.[125] Mining of ruby deposits began in 2007. Other mineral prospects are improving as prices are increasing. These include iron, uranium, aluminium, nickel, platinum, tungsten, titanium, and copper. Despite resumption[when?] of several hydrocarbon and mineral exploration activities, it will take several years before hydrocarbon production can materialize. The state oil company Nunaoil was created to help develop the hydrocarbon industry in Greenland. The state company Nunamineral has been launched on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange to raise more capital to increase the production of gold, started in 2007. Electricity has traditionally been generated by oil or diesel power plants, even if there is a large surplus of potential hydropower. There is a programme to build hydro power plants. The first, and still the largest, is Buksefjord hydroelectric power plant. There are also plans to build a large aluminium smelter, using hydropower to create an exportable product. It is expected that much of the labour needed will be imported.[127] The European Union has urged Greenland to restrict People's Republic of China development of rare-earth projects, as China accounts for 95% of the world's current supply. In early 2013, the Greenland government said that it had no plans to impose such restrictions.[128] The public sector, including publicly owned enterprises and the municipalities, plays a dominant role in Greenland's economy. About half the government revenues come from grants from the Danish government, an important supplement to the gross domestic product (GDP). Gross domestic product per capita is equivalent to that of the average economies of Europe. Greenland suffered an economic contraction in the early 1990s. But, since 1993, the economy has improved. The Greenland Home Rule Government (GHRG) has pursued a tight fiscal policy since the late 1980s, which has helped create surpluses in the public budget and low inflation. Since 1990, Greenland has registered a foreign-trade deficit following the closure of the last remaining lead and zinc mine that year. In 2017, new sources of ruby in Greenland have been discovered, promising to bring new industry and a new export from the country.[129] (See Gemstone industry in Greenland). Transport Main articles: Transport in Greenland and List of airports in Greenland Air Greenland operates passenger and cargo freight services by air from, to and across Greenland. Arctic Umiaq Line operates passenger and freight services by sea across Greenland. There is air transport both within Greenland and between the island and other nations. There is also scheduled boat traffic, but the long distances lead to long travel times and low frequency. There are virtually no roads between cities because the coast has many fjords that would require ferry service to connect a road network. The only exception is a gravel road of 5 km (3 mi) length between Kangilinnguit and the now abandoned former cryolite mining town of Ivittuut.[130] In addition, the lack of agriculture, forestry and similar countryside activities has meant that very few country roads have been built. Kangerlussuaq Airport (SFJ) [131] is the largest airport and the main aviation hub for international passenger transport. It serves international and domestic airline operated flight.[132] SFJ is far from the vicinity of the larger metropolitan capital areas, 317 km (197 mi) to the capital Nuuk, and airline passenger services are available.[133] Greenland has no passenger railways. Nuuk Airport (GOH) [134] is the second-largest airport located just 6.0 km (3.7 mi) from the centre of the capital. GOH serves general aviation traffic and has daily- or regular domestic flights within Greenland. GOH also serves international flights to Iceland, business and private airplanes. Ilulissat Airport (JAV) [135] is a domestic airport that also serves international flights to Iceland. There are a total of 13 registered civil airports and 47 helipads in Greenland; most of them are unpaved and located in rural areas. The second longest runway is at Narsarsuaq, a domestic airport with limited international service in south Greenland. All civil aviation matters are handled by the Danish Transport Authority. Most airports including Nuuk Airport have short runways and can only be served by special fairly small aircraft on fairly short flights. Kangerlussuaq Airport around 100 kilometres (62 miles) inland from the west coast is the major airport of Greenland and the hub for domestic flights. Intercontinental flights connect mainly to Copenhagen. Travel between international destinations (except Iceland) and any city in Greenland requires a plane change. Icelandair operates flights from Reykjavík to a number of airports in Greenland, and the company promotes the service as a day-trip option from Iceland for tourists.[136] There are no direct flights to the United States or Canada, although there have been flights Kangerlussuaq – Baltimore,[137] and Nuuk – Iqaluit,[138] which were cancelled because of too few passengers and financial losses.[139] An alternative between Greenland and the United States/Canada is Icelandair with a plane change in Iceland.[140] Sea passenger transport is served by several coastal ferries. Arctic Umiaq Line makes a single round trip per week, taking 80 hours each direction.[141] Cargo freight by sea is handled by the shipping company Royal Arctic Line from, to and across Greenland. It provides trade and transport opportunities between Greenland, Europe and North America. Population Demographics For statistics on demographics, see Demographics of Greenland. See also: List of Greenlanders, Greenlandic Inuit, and Danish people in Greenland Tunumiit Inuit couple from Kulusuk Ethnic groups of Greenland[6] Ethnic groups percent Greenlandic 89.7% Danish 7.8% Other 1.4% Nordic 1.1% Greenland has a population of 56,081 (January 2020 Estimate).[7] In terms of country of birth, the population is estimated to be of 89.7% Greenlandic (Inuit including European-Inuit multi-ethnic), 7.8% Danish, 1.1% Nordic and 1.4% other. The multi-ethnic population of European-Inuit represent people of Danish, Faroese, Icelandic, Norwegian, Dutch (whalers), German (Herrnhuters), Czech (Jednota bratrská) descent and others. The Inuit are indigenous to the Arctic and have traditionally inhabited Greenland, as well as areas in Canada and in Alaska in the United States. A 2015 wide genetic study of Greenlanders found modern-day Inuit in Greenland are direct descendants of the first Inuit pioneers of the Thule culture with ∼25% admixture of the European colonizers from the 16th century. Despite previous speculations, no evidence of Viking settlers predecessors has been found.[142] The majority of the population is Lutheran. Nearly all Greenlanders live along the fjords in the south-west of the main island, which has a relatively mild climate.[143] In 2020, 18,326 people reside in Nuuk, the capital city. Greenland's warmest climates such as the vegetated area around Narsarsuaq are sparsely populated, whereas the majority of the population lives north of 64°N in colder coastal climates. Greenland is the only country in the Americas where natives make up a majority of the population. vte Largest cities or towns in Greenland2020 estimate[144] Rank Name Municipality Pop.

Greenlandic became the sole official language in June 2009,[145] In practice, Danish is still widely used in the administration and in higher education, as well as remaining the first or only language for some Danish immigrants in Nuuk and other larger towns. Debate about the roles of Greenlandic and Danish in the country's future is ongoing. The orthography of Greenlandic was established in 1851[146] and revised in 1973. The country has a 100% literacy rate.[126] A majority of the population speaks West Greenlandic, most of them bi- or tri-lingually. It is spoken by about 50,000 people, making it the most populous of the Eskaleut language family, spoken by more people than all the other languages of the family combined. Kalaallisut is the language of West Greenland, which has long been the most populous area of the island. This has led to its de facto status as the official ""Greenlandic"" language, although the northern language Inuktun is spoken by 1,000 or so people around Qaanaaq, and East Greenlandic (Tunumiisut) by around 3,000.[147] Each of these varieties is nearly unintelligible to the speakers of the others. Inuktun is closer to the Inuit languages of Canada than it is to other Greenlandic, and some linguists consider Tunumiit to be a separate language as well.[citation needed] A UNESCO report has labelled the other varieties as endangered, and measures are now being considered to protect East Greenlandic dialect.[148] About 12% of the population speak Danish as a first or sole language. These are primarily Danish immigrants in Greenland, many of whom fill positions such as administrators, professionals, academics, or skilled tradesmen. While Greenlandic is dominant in all smaller settlements, a part of the population of Inuit or multi-ethnic ancestry, especially in towns, speaks Danish. Most of the Inuit population speaks Danish as a second language. In larger towns, especially Nuuk and in the higher social strata, this is a large group. English is another important language for Greenland, taught in schools from the first school year.[149] Education Education is organised in a similar way to Denmark. There is ten year mandatory primary school. There is also a secondary school, with either work education or preparatory for university education. There is one university, the University of Greenland (Greenlandic: Ilisimatusarfik) in Nuuk. Many Greenlanders attend universities in Denmark or elsewhere. The public school system in Greenland is, as in Denmark, under the jurisdiction of the municipalities: they are therefore municipal schools. The legislature specifies the standards allowed for the content in schools, but the municipal governments decide how the schools under their responsibility are run. Education is free and compulsory for children aged seven to 16. The financial effort devoted to education is now very important (11.3% of GDP). Section 1 of the Government Ordinance on Public Schools (as amended on June 6, 1997) requires Greenlandic as the language of instruction. Education is governed by Regulation No. 10 of 25 October 1990 on primary and lower secondary education. This regulation was amended by Regulation No. 8 of 13 May 1993 and Regulation No. 1 of 1 March 1994. Under Regulation No. 10 of 25 October 1990, linguistic integration in primary and lower secondary schools became compulsory for all students. The aim is to place Greenlandic-speaking and Danish-speaking pupils in the same classes, whereas previously they were placed in separate classes according to their mother tongue. At the same time, the government guarantees that Danish speakers can learn Greenlandic. In this way, the Greenlandic government wants to give the same linguistic, cultural and social education to all students, both those of Greenlandic and Danish origin. A study, which was carried out during a three-year trial period, concluded that this policy had achieved positive results. This bilingualism policy has been in force since 1994. Ilimmarfik university Campus in NuukAbout 100 schools have been established. Greenlandic and Danish are taught there. Normally, Greenlandic is taught from kindergarten to the end of secondary school, but Danish is compulsory from the first cycle of primary school as a second language. As in Denmark with Danish, the school system provides for ""Greenlandic 1"" and ""Greenlandic 2"" courses. Language tests allow students to move from one level to the other. Based on the teachers' evaluation of their students, a third level of courses has been added: ""Greenlandic 3"". Secondary education in Greenland is generally vocational and technical education. The system is governed by Regulation No. 16 of 28 October 1993 on Vocational and Technical Education, Scholarships and Career Guidance. Danish remains the main language of instruction. The capital, Nuuk, has a (bilingual) teacher training college and a (bilingual) university. At the end of their studies, all students must pass a test in the Greenlandic language. Higher education is offered in Greenland: ""university education"" (regulation no. 3 of May 9, 1989); training of journalists, training of primary and lower secondary school teachers, training of social workers, training of social educators (regulation no. 1 of May 16, 1989); and training of nurses and nursing assistants (regulation no. 9 of May 13, 1990). Greenlandic students can continue their education in Denmark, if they wish and have the financial means to do so. For admission to Danish educational institutions, Greenlandic applicants are placed on an equal footing with Danish applicants. Scholarships are granted to Greenlandic students who are admitted to Danish educational institutions. To be eligible for these scholarships, the applicant must be a Danish citizen and have had permanent residence in Greenland for at least five years. The total period of residence outside Greenland may not exceed three years. Religion Main article: Religion in Greenland Religion in Greenland (2010):[150][151] Protestantism (95.5%)  Roman Catholicism (0.2%)  Other Christian (0.4%)  Inuit spiritual beliefs (0.8%)  Agnostic (2.3%)  Atheist (0.2%)  Other Religion (0.6%) Most Greenlandic villages, including Nanortalik, have their own church. The nomadic Inuit people were traditionally shamanistic, with a well-developed mythology primarily concerned with appeasing a vengeful and fingerless sea goddess who controlled the success of the seal and whale hunts. The first Norse colonists worshipped the Norse gods, but Erik the Red's son Leif was converted to Christianity by King Olaf Trygvesson on a trip to Norway in 999 and sent missionaries back to Greenland. These swiftly established sixteen parishes, some monasteries, and a bishopric at Garðar. Rediscovering these colonists and spreading ideas of the Protestant Reformation among them was one of the primary reasons for the Danish recolonization in the 18th century. Under the patronage of the Royal Mission College in Copenhagen, Norwegian and Danish Lutherans and German Moravian missionaries searched for the missing Norse settlements, but no Norse were found, and instead they began preaching to the Inuit. The principal figures in the Christianization of Greenland were Hans and Poul Egede and Matthias Stach. The New Testament was translated piecemeal from the time of the very first settlement on Kangeq Island, but the first translation of the whole Bible was not completed until 1900. An improved translation using the modern orthography was completed in 2000.[152] Today, the major religion is Protestant Christianity, represented mainly by the Church of Denmark, which is Lutheran in orientation. While there are no official census data on religion in Greenland, the Bishop of Greenland Sofie Petersen[153] estimates that 85% of the Greenlandic population are members of her congregation.[154] The Church of Denmark is the established church through the Constitution of Denmark.[155] The Roman Catholic minority is pastorally served by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Copenhagen. There are still Christian missionaries on the island, but mainly from charismatic movements proselytizing fellow Christians.[156] According to Operation World, just 4.7% of Greenlanders are Evangelical Christian, although the Evangelical population is growing at an annual rate of 8.4%.[157] Social issues The rate of suicide in Greenland is very high. According to a 2010 census, Greenland holds the highest suicide rate in the world.[158][159] Another significant social issue faced by Greenland is a high rate of alcoholism.[160] Alcohol consumption rates in Greenland reached their height in the 1980s, when it was twice as high as in Denmark, and had by 2010 fallen slightly below the average level of consumption in Denmark (which at the time were 12th highest in the world, but has since fallen). However, at the same time, alcohol prices are far higher, meaning that consumption has a large social impact.[161][162] Prevalence of HIV/AIDS used to be high in Greenland and peaked in the 1990s when the fatality rate also was relatively high. Through a number of initiatives the prevalence (along with the fatality rate through efficient treatment) has fallen and is now low, c. 0.13%,[163][164] below most other countries. In recent decades, the unemployment rates have generally been somewhat above those in Denmark;[165] in 2017, the rate was 6.8% in Greenland,[166] compared to 5.6% in Denmark.[167] Culture Main articles: Culture of Greenland and Music of Greenland See also: Human rights in Denmark § Indigenous rights Nive Nielsen, Greenlandic singer and songwriter Panel discussion with Greenlandic movie maker Inuk Silis Høegh at the launch of his movie about groundbreaking Greenlandic band Sumé Today Greenlandic culture is a blending of traditional Inuit (Kalaallit, Tunumiit, Inughuit) and Scandinavian culture. Inuit, or Kalaallit, culture has a strong artistic tradition, dating back thousands of years. The Kalaallit are known for an art form of figures called tupilak or a ""spirit object"". Traditional art-making practices thrive in the Ammassalik.[168] Sperm whale ivory remains a valued medium for carving.[169] Music Greenland also has a successful, albeit small, music culture. Some popular Greenlandic bands and artists include Sume (classic rock), Chilly Friday (rock), Nanook (rock), Siissisoq (rock), Nuuk Posse (hip hop) and Rasmus Lyberth (folk), who performed in the Danish national final for the 1979 Eurovision Song Contest, performing in Greenlandic. The singer-songwriter Simon Lynge is the first musical artist from Greenland to have an album released across the United Kingdom, and to perform at the UK's Glastonbury Festival. The music culture of Greenland also includes traditional Inuit music, largely revolving around singing and drums. The drum is the traditional Greenlandic instrument. It was used to perform traditional drum dances. For this purpose, a round drum (qilaat) in the form of a frame made of driftwood or walrus ribs covered with a polar bear bladder, polar bear stomach or walrus stomach was used. The drumming was not done on the membrane, but with a stick from underneath the frame. Simple melodies were sung for this purpose. The drum dance used to serve two functions: On the one hand, the drum was used to drive away fear on long, dark winter nights. To do this, the drum dancer would make faces and try to make others laugh until all fear was forgotten. Disputes were also settled with the drum. If someone had misbehaved, he was challenged with the drum. People would gather at certain powerful places and take turns beating the drum and singing to it. They tried to ridicule the other person as much as possible. The spectators expressed with their laughter who was the winner and who was therefore the guilty one. The drum could also be used by shamans for ritual conjurations of spirits. After the arrival of missionaries in the 18th century, the drum dance (still popular among Canadian Inuit today) was banned as pagan and shamanistic and replaced by polyphonic singing of secular and church songs. This choral singing is known today for its special sound. Church hymns are partly of German origin due to the influence of the Herrnhuter Brüdergemeinde. Scandinavian, German and Scottish whalers brought the fiddle, accordion and polka (kalattuut) to Greenland, where they are now played in intricate dance steps. Sport Main article: Sport in Greenland Sport is an important part of Greenlandic culture, as the population is generally quite active.[170] Popular sports include association football, track and field, handball and skiing. Handball is often referred to as the national sport,[171] and Greenland's men's national team was ranked among the top 20 in the world in 2001. Greenland has excellent conditions for skiing, fishing, snowboarding, ice climbing and rock climbing, although mountain climbing and hiking are preferred by the general public. Although the environment is generally ill-suited for golf, there is a golf course in Nuuk. Cuisine Main article: Greenlandic cuisine The national dish of Greenland is suaasat, a soup made from seal meat. Meat from marine mammals, game, birds, and fish play a large role in the Greenlandic diet. Due to the glacial landscape, most ingredients come from the ocean.[172] Spices are seldom used besides salt and pepper.[173] Greenlandic coffee is a ""flaming"" dessert coffee (set alight before serving) made with coffee, whiskey, Kahlúa, Grand Marnier, and whipped cream. It is stronger than the familiar Irish dessert coffee.[174] Media Teletaarnet Headquarters in Nuuk Greenland Kalaallit Nunaata Radioa (KNR) is the public broadcasting company of Greenland. It is an associate member of Eurovision and an associate member of the Nordvision network. Nearly one hundred people are directly employed by this company, which is one of the largest in the territory.[175] The city of Nuuk also has its own radio and television station. The city of Nuuk also has a local television channel, Nanoq Media, which was created on 1 August 2002. It is the largest local television station in Greenland, reaching more than 4,000 households as receiving members, which corresponds to about 75% of all households in the capital.[176] Today only two newspapers are published in Greenland, both of which are distributed nationally. The Greenlandic weekly Sermitsiaq is published every Friday, while the online version is updated several times a day. It was distributed only in Nuuk until the 1980s. It is named after the mountain Sermitsiaq, located about 15 kilometers northeast of Nuuk. The bi-weekly Atuagagdliutit/Grønlandsposten (AG) is the other newspaper in Greenland, published every Tuesday and Thursday in Greenlandic as Atuagagdliutit and in Danish as Grønlandsposten. The articles are all published in both languages. Fine arts The Inuit have their own arts and crafts tradition; for example, they carve the tupilak. This Kalaallisut word means soul or spirit of a deceased person and today describes an artistic figure, usually no more than 20 centimetres tall, carved mainly from walrus ivory, with a variety of unusual shapes. This sculpture actually represents a mythical or spiritual being; usually, however, it has become a mere collector's item because of its grotesque appearance for Western visual habits. Modern artisans, however, still use indigenous materials such as musk ox and sheep wool, seal fur, shells, soapstone, reindeer antlers or gemstones. The history of Greenlandic painting began with Aron von Kangeq, who depicted the old Greenlandic sagas and myths in his drawings and watercolours in the mid-19th century. In the 20th century, landscape and animal painting developed, as well as printmaking and book illustrations with sometimes expressive colouring. It was mainly through their landscape paintings that Kiistat Lund and Buuti Pedersen became known abroad. Anne-Birthe Hove chose themes from Greenlandic social life. There is a museum of fine arts in Nuuk, the Nuuk Art Museum.

On 13 March 1974, IPIECA was established at the request of United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) to develop a shared industry response to environmental and social issues. Home About us 45 years of IPIECA 45 years of IPIECA Member testimonials BP Chevron ConocoPhillips ENI Equinor ExxonMobil Inpex OMV Petroleum Development Oman PTTEP Repsol Schlumberger Shell Total Wintershall BP ""BP’s association with IPIECA spans 45 years.That’s over 4 decades of bringing our industry together to develop and share good practices to manage environmental and social challenges. The world faces many pressing issues currently, and our industry has a part to play. IPIECA’s role will be to continue to harness these efforts and those of civil society. So long as we choose the path of collaboration and innovation, both our industry and the world have a great future ahead – one that will help solve the dual challenge of more energy with less emissions."" Bernard Looney, CEO Chevron ""Chevron is focused on delivering the energy that improves lives and enables human progress. Life depends on affordable, reliable and ever-cleaner energy, and we are always evolving to ensure we deliver greater benefit with less environmental impact. For 45 years, IPIECA has had the same focus. It has provided an important global forum for industry to share and promote best practices around environmental and social issues – while engaging key global stakeholders and scanning the horizon to ensure we are prepared to meet growing expectations. Progress is not possible without partnerships. We are proud to work with IPIECA to continue advancing our industry’s social and environmental performance around the world.​"" Mike Wirth, Chairman and CEO ConocoPhillips ""Through collaboration with a wide range of international stakeholders, IPIECA has fostered improved industry performance on multiple environmental and social issues. IPIECA’s efforts have enhanced oil spill response preparedness; created a global water resource tool; implemented a mitigation hierarchy for biodiversity risks; and helped industry focus on social issues like human rights. In the climate change debate, IPIECA’s reports titled The Paris Puzzle and Exploring Low-Emission Pathways provided a unified industry voice on issues that should be considered as governments address climate change policy. IPIECA’s ability to achieve collaboration among stakeholders will be essential to society’s efforts to manage long-term transitions in energy supply while also ensuring continued economic growth.​"" Ryan Lance, Chairman and CEO ENI ""IPIECA plays a key role in seeking solutions to some of the most crucial environmental and social challenges that the oil & gas industry is facing today. We value its expertise, its continued efforts in promoting knowledge and shaping shared solutions. Participating in its working groups is an enrichment for each of our people at Eni. IPIECA will continue to be a central player in fostering cooperation within our industry and with international partners."" Claudio Descalzi, CEO Equinor ""In Equinor we believe that collaboration is key to achieve our purpose of turning natural resources into energy for people and progress for society. When dealing with global challenges related to climate, environment and social issues – collaboration will be essential. IPIECA is an organization that brings the global oil and gas industry together and provides us with the opportunity to share, learn and develop good practices efficiently. Equinor appreciates the commitment and insight that IPIECA has provided for 45 years."" Eldar Sætre, President and CEO ExxonMobil ""ExxonMobil values IPIECA’s efforts to help advance our industry’s environmental and social performance. As an active member of IPIECA since its inception, we appreciate the public-private collaborations IPIECA facilitates with a variety of stakeholders, particularly the United Nations Environment Programme. We look forward to working with IPIECA for the next 45 years and beyond to promote the positive impact the oil and gas industry has on society."" Darren Woods, Chairman and CEO Inpex ""IPIECA is an informative forum for continuing discussions with global oil and gas companies, particularly in the focus areas of social responsibility, climate change, and sustainability reporting.​ IPIECA significantly contributes to the industry by developing guidelines and position papers in these areas. In addition, its workshops guide and educate members through these challenging topics. ​ INPEX was involved in the process of developing IPIECA’s “The Paris Puzzle”, in 2015,which then formed the basis of our own climate position paper.​ In future years, as an ExCom member, INPEX would like to continue to promote and further strengthen collaboration among IPIECA members."" Takayuki Udea, President and CEO OMV ""Today the oil & gas industry must reliably deliver affordable energy for a sustainable supply while conducting business responsibly and protecting the environment. In this way OMV aims to provide `oil & gas at its best´. ​ IPIECA plays a major role not only in facilitating experience exchange but also in supporting the fostering and improvement of industrywide guidelines as well as sharing best practices and toolkits with regard to environmental and social performance."" Berhard Heneis, Head of Sustainability and Reporting Petroleum Development Oman ""In a rapidly changing world that presents many challenges and opportunities for the oil and gas sector in areas such as the environment, the growth of renewables, social responsibility and addressing public perception issues, IPIECA makes an invaluable global contribution. Raoul Restucci, Managing Director PTTEP ""Today’s multifaceted oil and gas industry and rapidly changing world, demands closer partnership between oil and gas companies. As a member of IPIECA, PTTEP has had an excellent association with IPIECA, and, over the years, we have been fully supportive of the sustainability policies under IPIECA. ​ Enabling the building of productive dialogue and activities between member companies, IPIECA provides an invaluable opportunity to collaborate and initiate fruitful exchanges between industry and our stakeholders."" Phongsthorn Thavisin, CEO Repsol ""IPIECA’s 45-year history of shared knowledge and good practices has helped achieve excellence in sustainability, not just for members but for the overall industry, thanks to the openness and willingness to work together of all involved.​ The challenge for the future lies in that, together, we must continue to guarantee a competitive, sustainable and affordable energy supply for a growing world while working to ever-higher standards of efficiency and transparency. To this end, I believe IPIECA can continue play a central role in lifting collective industry performance."" Josu Jon Imaz, CEO Schlumberger ""IPIECA’s Environmental, Social and Governance leadership benefits the entire E&P industry. As IPIECA’s first associate member, we have derived tremendous value through our participation on the various social and environmental sustainability committees. By working closely with other IPIECA members, we have strengthened our Global Stewardship program, which is our blueprint for deploying technology and processes to optimize our global operations and reduce the environmental footprint.​ We are proud to be members of the IPIECA team, and we look forward to continuing on our journey to protect the world’s natural resources for the generations to come."" Olivier Le Peuch, Chairman and CEO Shell ""IPIECA has played an important role in many of our industry’s advances over the past four decades, with shared best practices enabling significant progress across a wide range of environmental and social issues. Shell…sees an important role for IPIECA in the coming years.​ The challenges the world faces in managing the stresses between demands for energy, water and food are too large for any individual company to tackle alone. Greater levels of collaboration and trust are needed between government, business and civil society to address these challenges and create shared value. Working with a range of partners helps us to develop practical solutions that can be implemented across our industry to reduce out impacts and create broader benefits for society."" Ben Van Beurden, CEO Total ""IPIECA has a fundamental role to play in bringing the oil and gas industry and stakeholders together around best environmental and social practices. It’s an association in which we are preparing the future together, building on the industry’s past experience. Regarding the Sustainable Development Goals, we can be proud that IPIECA was behind one of the first industry initiatives with the Sustainable Development Goals Atlas. The continued development of the Global Initiative for oil spill response is also very positive for our industry. Lastly, methods and tools like the Local Water Tool have become an important resource for Total in successfully managing its water risk."" Patrick Pouyanné, Chairman and CEO Wintershall ""Over the past 45 years, IPIECA has succeeded in consolidating the environmental and social ambitions of many oil and gas companies by developing, sharing and promoting good practices and knowledge - into a strong industrial position. By this, we can show that our industry is key for a responsible and sustainable energy supply now and in the future.​"" Mario Mehren, Chairman and CEO A 45 year track of success View our timeline to see the progression of our work programme, as well as key developments in the broader global sustainability area Download the 45th anniversary graphics Related Pages IPIECA celebrates its 45th anniversary For 45 years, IPIECA has been working with its members to advance environmental and social performance across the oil and gas industry.

We work to provide lasting routes out of poverty, empowering people to transform their lives and serving all communities without prejudice.” Aims[edit] According to Islamic Relief's Global Strategy 2017–2021[5] document the organisation's four global goals are: Reducing the humanitarian impact of conflicts and natural disasters Empowering communities to emerge from poverty and vulnerability Mobilising people and funds to support our work Strengthening the Islamic Relief federation IRW is a member of the UN's Economic and Social Council and it is a signatory to the Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and NGOs in Disaster Relief.

The Charity is also the parent body to ""Charity Week"", which claims to be the largest student run project globally. Values[edit] Also according to Islamic Relief's Global Strategy 2017–2021 document the organisation states their values and teachings are provided by the revelations contained within the Qur'an and Prophetic example. They are Ikhlas (sincerity), Ihsan (excellence), Rahma (compassion), Adl (social justice) and Amana (custodianship). History[edit] Islamic Relief was established in 1984 by Dr Hany El-Banna and fellow students from the University of Birmingham in response to a famine in the Horn of Africa. Its first donation was 20p, raised from door-to-door collections.[7] The charity grew with strong grassroots community support and over the past 35 years has grown to with affiliated organisations raising funds across Europe, America, Australia and elsewhere. In 2017,[2] Islamic Relief reported an income of £126 million which includes individual donations and institutional funding from DFID, UN agencies, USAID, and other partners. Inspired by Islamic humanitarian values, it works with Muslim and non-Muslim communities around the world. The charity registered with the Charity Commission of England and Wales in 1989 and remains an independent non-political non-governmental organisation (NGO). Humanitarian programmes[edit] Islamic Relief has been responding to humanitarian crises around the world for the past 35 years with an aim to reduce the impact of conflicts and natural disasters. It focuses on ensuring rapid response, providing emergency relief and protecting vulnerable people. It also helps communities prepare for disaster, making them more resilient, and influences government disaster risk reduction programmes. Islamic Relief's key emergency interventions in its 35-year history include providing life-saving aid during the wars in Bosnia and Kosova in the 1990s,[8] providing medical assistance during the wars in Afghanistan[9] and Iraq,[10] and managing refugee camps in Darfur, Sudan.[11] It has also responded to natural disasters including the 2004 Asian tsunami,[12] the Kashmir earthquake in 2005[13] and drought in the Horn of Africa.[14] The charity's current emergency appeals include supporting 2.5 million people at risk of famine and disease in Yemen,[15] assisting vulnerable communities affected by the ongoing violence in Myanmar, and delivering aid to 1.4 million people in war-torn Syria,[16] including in Idlib where it is one of the few aid agencies still operating directly. Islamic Relief also runs an annual global Ramadan and Qurbani food distribution programme reaching millions of food-insecure people.[17] Development programmes[edit] Islamic Relief's development programmes aim to empower communities to emerge from poverty and become less vulnerable. It focuses on providing long-term sustainability including climate adaptation, livelihood support including Islamic microfinance and orphan sponsorship programmes. In 2001 it set up Waqf programmes,[18] supported by donors and run as an Islamic endowment scheme. In 2006 Islamic Relief signed a Programme Partnership Agreement with the UK government's Department for International Development, recognising the charity's capacity to contribute to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Its current development strategy is aligned to support the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In 2017, Islamic Relief reports to have supported 4.3 million people in 34 countries with its development programmes. During the year it provided 16,500 people with microfinance loans to improve their livelihoods, ensured 48,000 people had better access to education, increased long-term food security for 208,000 people and gave over 900,000 people access to water, sanitation, hygiene and healthcare services. Also in 2017, Islamic Relief ran a peace-building programme with Muslim and Christian communities in the Central African Republic as part of an interfaith consortium with Catholic Relief Services, World Vision International and Aegis Trust. The programme directly benefited over 2,000 people, improving social cohesion and livelihood security.[19] Advocacy and campaigns[edit] In August 2015 Islamic Relief launched an Islamic Climate Change Declaration[20] with GreenFaith and the Islamic Foundation for Ecology and Environmental and Sciences, calling on Muslim communities to take an active role in climate action at local, national and international levels. The Declaration makes an Islamic faith-endorsed case for protecting the environment with support from global Muslim leaders. It was launched at the Istanbul Symposium and presented at the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris (COP 21). In 2017, Islamic Relief implemented 50 projects worldwide to reduce the impact of climate change.[19] In 2018, at the UN Commission on the Status of Women conference in New York (CSW62) Islamic Relief announced a forthcoming Islamic Declaration on Gender Justice.[21] The Declaration is a call to action against gender inequality from an Islamic faith perspective, and seeks to tackle discrimination and harmful practices, especially against women and girls in Muslim communities. Consultations on the Declaration are currently taking place among faith leaders, NGOs, UN agencies and grassroots community groups. The Declaration is part of Islamic Relief's gender justice work which includes tackling early and forced marriage, domestic violence and female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C). Affiliated organisations[edit] TIC International Ltd[edit] TIC International[22] is a trading subsidiary of Islamic Relief. It supports they charity's fundraising activities by recycling clothes and running 14 charity shops across the UK. Humanitarian Academy for Development[edit] Formerly known as the Islamic Relief Academy, the Humanitarian Academy for Development[23] re-launched in 2018 as a centre for learning and research to benefit the humanitarian sector. Memberships and key partnerships[edit] Islamic Relief is a member of the UN's Economic and Social Council and is a signatory to the Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and NGOs in Disaster Relief. It is also a member of Bond (British Overseas NGOs for Development) and in the UK, a member of the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC), along with 14 other major charities.

Islamic Relief offices and partners[edit] A 2018 map of where Islamic Relief works Awards[edit] In 2019, Islamic Relief won the BOND International Development Innovation Award for its programme Eliminating Extreme Poverty through Alternative Livelihoods for Orphaned families (ALO) in Bangladesh. Controversies[edit] In June 2014, Israel added Islamic Relief to a list of organisations banned from operating in Israel, for allegedly funding Hamas. The charity's West Bank offices were raided and their computers were destroyed, files were confiscated, and an office safe was forcibly opened. In late 2014, Islamic Relief claimed[24] that an audit carried out by an unnamed ""leading global audit firm"" found no evidence of any link to terrorism. The Israeli government responded by claiming its decision to declare Islamic Relief illegal was ""based on information that has been accumulated over years, that the fund is a central player in financing of Hamas"". The organisation has challenged the decision in the Israeli courts.[25] Subsequently, on 15 November 2014, the United Arab Emirates placed Islamic Relief on a list of proscribed organisations due to alleged links to the Muslim Brotherhood.[26][27] The organisation denies any links to the Muslim Brotherhood[28] citing the organisation's neutral stance and humanitarian nature. In 2016, it was reported that the banking group HSBC decided to sever ties with Islamic Relief over concerns that ""cash meant for humanitarian aid could potentially end up with terrorist groups abroad"".[29] HSBC invited Islamic Relief to ""end the relationship"", which the bank did in any case at the end of 2014, as it has with other aid and civil society organisations.[30] The government of Bangladesh barred the organisation from aiding the Rohingya people in Cox's Bazar, alleging funds were used to preach Islam, construct mosques, encourage radicalism, and fund militants.[31] Islamic Relief refutes these allegations and continues its work across Bangladesh, where it has been present for over 25 years.[32] In 2019 the German government allege they have ""significant personal ties"" with the Muslim Brotherhood, which was denied by Islamic Relief.[33][34] In July 2020, Islamic Relief's director Heshmat Khalifa resigned after The Times discovered he had made antisemitic remarks on his Facebook page in 2014 and 2015.[35] In an interview with The Guardian, CEO Naser Haghamed said he was ""appalled"" by the ""unacceptable posts"".[36] Miguel Ángel Moratinos, High-Representative for the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations (UNAOC), expressed dismay regarding Khalifa's outbursts, including labeling Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi a ""pimp son of the Jews"" and calling the Israeli government the ""grandchildren of monkeys and pigs.""[37] In late August, it was announced that the entire board would be resigning in what was described as ""a part of far-reaching governance reforms”.[38][39] In January 2021, the Charity Commission of England and Wales, completed a compliance case into the organisation stating that it was ""satisfied that it is making the necessary improvements in terms of the vetting of trustees, and ongoing oversight over their social media activities.""[40] Additionally, the Dutch government announced that they would give no public funds to IRW after allegations of connections to the Muslim Brotherhood in the media.[41] In late January 2021, an Independent Commission headed by former UK Attorney General Dominic Grieve, concluded that ""the offensive views articulated by the former senior director and two former trustees did not in any way compromise the impartiality or integrity of the organization’s humanitarian programmes.""[42] References[edit] ^ a b ""Charity Details"". beta.charitycommission.gov.uk. ^ a b ""Charity overview"". apps.charitycommission.gov.uk.

The Charity is also the parent body to ""Charity Week"", which claims to be the largest student run project globally. Values[edit] Also according to Islamic Relief's Global Strategy 2017–2021 document the organisation states their values and teachings are provided by the revelations contained within the Qur'an and Prophetic example. They are Ikhlas (sincerity), Ihsan (excellence), Rahma (compassion), Adl (social justice) and Amana (custodianship). History[edit] Islamic Relief was established in 1984 by Dr Hany El-Banna and fellow students from the University of Birmingham in response to a famine in the Horn of Africa. Its first donation was 20p, raised from door-to-door collections.[7] The charity grew with strong grassroots community support and over the past 35 years has grown to with affiliated organisations raising funds across Europe, America, Australia and elsewhere. In 2017,[2] Islamic Relief reported an income of £126 million which includes individual donations and institutional funding from DFID, UN agencies, USAID, and other partners. Inspired by Islamic humanitarian values, it works with Muslim and non-Muslim communities around the world. The charity registered with the Charity Commission of England and Wales in 1989 and remains an independent non-political non-governmental organisation (NGO). Humanitarian programmes[edit] Islamic Relief has been responding to humanitarian crises around the world for the past 35 years with an aim to reduce the impact of conflicts and natural disasters. It focuses on ensuring rapid response, providing emergency relief and protecting vulnerable people. It also helps communities prepare for disaster, making them more resilient, and influences government disaster risk reduction programmes. Islamic Relief's key emergency interventions in its 35-year history include providing life-saving aid during the wars in Bosnia and Kosova in the 1990s,[8] providing medical assistance during the wars in Afghanistan[9] and Iraq,[10] and managing refugee camps in Darfur, Sudan.[11] It has also responded to natural disasters including the 2004 Asian tsunami,[12] the Kashmir earthquake in 2005[13] and drought in the Horn of Africa.[14] The charity's current emergency appeals include supporting 2.5 million people at risk of famine and disease in Yemen,[15] assisting vulnerable communities affected by the ongoing violence in Myanmar, and delivering aid to 1.4 million people in war-torn Syria,[16] including in Idlib where it is one of the few aid agencies still operating directly. Islamic Relief also runs an annual global Ramadan and Qurbani food distribution programme reaching millions of food-insecure people.[17] Development programmes[edit] Islamic Relief's development programmes aim to empower communities to emerge from poverty and become less vulnerable. It focuses on providing long-term sustainability including climate adaptation, livelihood support including Islamic microfinance and orphan sponsorship programmes. In 2001 it set up Waqf programmes,[18] supported by donors and run as an Islamic endowment scheme. In 2006 Islamic Relief signed a Programme Partnership Agreement with the UK government's Department for International Development, recognising the charity's capacity to contribute to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Its current development strategy is aligned to support the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In 2017, Islamic Relief reports to have supported 4.3 million people in 34 countries with its development programmes. During the year it provided 16,500 people with microfinance loans to improve their livelihoods, ensured 48,000 people had better access to education, increased long-term food security for 208,000 people and gave over 900,000 people access to water, sanitation, hygiene and healthcare services. Also in 2017, Islamic Relief ran a peace-building programme with Muslim and Christian communities in the Central African Republic as part of an interfaith consortium with Catholic Relief Services, World Vision International and Aegis Trust. The programme directly benefited over 2,000 people, improving social cohesion and livelihood security.[19] Advocacy and campaigns[edit] In August 2015 Islamic Relief launched an Islamic Climate Change Declaration[20] with GreenFaith and the Islamic Foundation for Ecology and Environmental and Sciences, calling on Muslim communities to take an active role in climate action at local, national and international levels. The Declaration makes an Islamic faith-endorsed case for protecting the environment with support from global Muslim leaders. It was launched at the Istanbul Symposium and presented at the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris (COP 21). In 2017, Islamic Relief implemented 50 projects worldwide to reduce the impact of climate change.[19] In 2018, at the UN Commission on the Status of Women conference in New York (CSW62) Islamic Relief announced a forthcoming Islamic Declaration on Gender Justice.[21] The Declaration is a call to action against gender inequality from an Islamic faith perspective, and seeks to tackle discrimination and harmful practices, especially against women and girls in Muslim communities. Consultations on the Declaration are currently taking place among faith leaders, NGOs, UN agencies and grassroots community groups. The Declaration is part of Islamic Relief's gender justice work which includes tackling early and forced marriage, domestic violence and female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C). Affiliated organisations[edit] TIC International Ltd[edit] TIC International[22] is a trading subsidiary of Islamic Relief. It supports they charity's fundraising activities by recycling clothes and running 14 charity shops across the UK. Humanitarian Academy for Development[edit] Formerly known as the Islamic Relief Academy, the Humanitarian Academy for Development[23] re-launched in 2018 as a centre for learning and research to benefit the humanitarian sector. Memberships and key partnerships[edit] Islamic Relief is a member of the UN's Economic and Social Council and is a signatory to the Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and NGOs in Disaster Relief. It is also a member of Bond (British Overseas NGOs for Development) and in the UK, a member of the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC), along with 14 other major charities.

Islamic Relief offices and partners[edit] A 2018 map of where Islamic Relief works Awards[edit] In 2019, Islamic Relief won the BOND International Development Innovation Award for its programme Eliminating Extreme Poverty through Alternative Livelihoods for Orphaned families (ALO) in Bangladesh. Controversies[edit] In June 2014, Israel added Islamic Relief to a list of organisations banned from operating in Israel, for allegedly funding Hamas. The charity's West Bank offices were raided and their computers were destroyed, files were confiscated, and an office safe was forcibly opened. In late 2014, Islamic Relief claimed[24] that an audit carried out by an unnamed ""leading global audit firm"" found no evidence of any link to terrorism. The Israeli government responded by claiming its decision to declare Islamic Relief illegal was ""based on information that has been accumulated over years, that the fund is a central player in financing of Hamas"". The organisation has challenged the decision in the Israeli courts.[25] Subsequently, on 15 November 2014, the United Arab Emirates placed Islamic Relief on a list of proscribed organisations due to alleged links to the Muslim Brotherhood.[26][27] The organisation denies any links to the Muslim Brotherhood[28] citing the organisation's neutral stance and humanitarian nature. In 2016, it was reported that the banking group HSBC decided to sever ties with Islamic Relief over concerns that ""cash meant for humanitarian aid could potentially end up with terrorist groups abroad"".[29] HSBC invited Islamic Relief to ""end the relationship"", which the bank did in any case at the end of 2014, as it has with other aid and civil society organisations.[30] The government of Bangladesh barred the organisation from aiding the Rohingya people in Cox's Bazar, alleging funds were used to preach Islam, construct mosques, encourage radicalism, and fund militants.[31] Islamic Relief refutes these allegations and continues its work across Bangladesh, where it has been present for over 25 years.[32] In 2019 the German government allege they have ""significant personal ties"" with the Muslim Brotherhood, which was denied by Islamic Relief.[33][34] In July 2020, Islamic Relief's director Heshmat Khalifa resigned after The Times discovered he had made antisemitic remarks on his Facebook page in 2014 and 2015.[35] In an interview with The Guardian, CEO Naser Haghamed said he was ""appalled"" by the ""unacceptable posts"".[36] Miguel Ángel Moratinos, High-Representative for the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations (UNAOC), expressed dismay regarding Khalifa's outbursts, including labeling Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi a ""pimp son of the Jews"" and calling the Israeli government the ""grandchildren of monkeys and pigs.""[37] In late August, it was announced that the entire board would be resigning in what was described as ""a part of far-reaching governance reforms”.[38][39] In January 2021, the Charity Commission of England and Wales, completed a compliance case into the organisation stating that it was ""satisfied that it is making the necessary improvements in terms of the vetting of trustees, and ongoing oversight over their social media activities.""[40] Additionally, the Dutch government announced that they would give no public funds to IRW after allegations of connections to the Muslim Brotherhood in the media.[41] In late January 2021, an Independent Commission headed by former UK Attorney General Dominic Grieve, concluded that ""the offensive views articulated by the former senior director and two former trustees did not in any way compromise the impartiality or integrity of the organization’s humanitarian programmes.""[42] References[edit] ^ a b ""Charity Details"". beta.charitycommission.gov.uk. ^ a b ""Charity overview"". apps.charitycommission.gov.uk.

The organisation states that its key partners include WFP, IDB, UNHCR, UNOCHA, EC, DFID, UNDP, OIC, Sida, Bahrain RCO, START Network, ROTA, and CAFOD. Islamic Relief is part of the global Make Poverty History coalition which is campaigning to end extreme poverty and the Beyond 2015 coalition, which aims to influence the development framework which will replace the Millennium Development Goals. It has also signed a Memorandum of Understanding to co-operate in humanitarian work with Lutheran World Federation(LWF)[6] and also formed a partnership with the African Union to tackle chronic poverty. The Charity is also the parent body to ""Charity Week"", which claims to be the largest student run project globally. Values[edit] Also according to Islamic Relief's Global Strategy 2017–2021 document the organisation states their values and teachings are provided by the revelations contained within the Qur'an and Prophetic example. They are Ikhlas (sincerity), Ihsan (excellence), Rahma (compassion), Adl (social justice) and Amana (custodianship). History[edit] Islamic Relief was established in 1984 by Dr Hany El-Banna and fellow students from the University of Birmingham in response to a famine in the Horn of Africa. Its first donation was 20p, raised from door-to-door collections.[7] The charity grew with strong grassroots community support and over the past 35 years has grown to with affiliated organisations raising funds across Europe, America, Australia and elsewhere. In 2017,[2] Islamic Relief reported an income of £126 million which includes individual donations and institutional funding from DFID, UN agencies, USAID, and other partners. Inspired by Islamic humanitarian values, it works with Muslim and non-Muslim communities around the world. The charity registered with the Charity Commission of England and Wales in 1989 and remains an independent non-political non-governmental organisation (NGO). Humanitarian programmes[edit] Islamic Relief has been responding to humanitarian crises around the world for the past 35 years with an aim to reduce the impact of conflicts and natural disasters. It focuses on ensuring rapid response, providing emergency relief and protecting vulnerable people. It also helps communities prepare for disaster, making them more resilient, and influences government disaster risk reduction programmes. Islamic Relief's key emergency interventions in its 35-year history include providing life-saving aid during the wars in Bosnia and Kosova in the 1990s,[8] providing medical assistance during the wars in Afghanistan[9] and Iraq,[10] and managing refugee camps in Darfur, Sudan.[11] It has also responded to natural disasters including the 2004 Asian tsunami,[12] the Kashmir earthquake in 2005[13] and drought in the Horn of Africa.[14] The charity's current emergency appeals include supporting 2.5 million people at risk of famine and disease in Yemen,[15] assisting vulnerable communities affected by the ongoing violence in Myanmar, and delivering aid to 1.4 million people in war-torn Syria,[16] including in Idlib where it is one of the few aid agencies still operating directly. Islamic Relief also runs an annual global Ramadan and Qurbani food distribution programme reaching millions of food-insecure people.[17] Development programmes[edit] Islamic Relief's development programmes aim to empower communities to emerge from poverty and become less vulnerable. It focuses on providing long-term sustainability including climate adaptation, livelihood support including Islamic microfinance and orphan sponsorship programmes. In 2001 it set up Waqf programmes,[18] supported by donors and run as an Islamic endowment scheme. In 2006 Islamic Relief signed a Programme Partnership Agreement with the UK government's Department for International Development, recognising the charity's capacity to contribute to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Its current development strategy is aligned to support the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In 2017, Islamic Relief reports to have supported 4.3 million people in 34 countries with its development programmes. During the year it provided 16,500 people with microfinance loans to improve their livelihoods, ensured 48,000 people had better access to education, increased long-term food security for 208,000 people and gave over 900,000 people access to water, sanitation, hygiene and healthcare services. Also in 2017, Islamic Relief ran a peace-building programme with Muslim and Christian communities in the Central African Republic as part of an interfaith consortium with Catholic Relief Services, World Vision International and Aegis Trust. The programme directly benefited over 2,000 people, improving social cohesion and livelihood security.[19] Advocacy and campaigns[edit] In August 2015 Islamic Relief launched an Islamic Climate Change Declaration[20] with GreenFaith and the Islamic Foundation for Ecology and Environmental and Sciences, calling on Muslim communities to take an active role in climate action at local, national and international levels. The Declaration makes an Islamic faith-endorsed case for protecting the environment with support from global Muslim leaders. It was launched at the Istanbul Symposium and presented at the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris (COP 21). In 2017, Islamic Relief implemented 50 projects worldwide to reduce the impact of climate change.[19] In 2018, at the UN Commission on the Status of Women conference in New York (CSW62) Islamic Relief announced a forthcoming Islamic Declaration on Gender Justice.[21] The Declaration is a call to action against gender inequality from an Islamic faith perspective, and seeks to tackle discrimination and harmful practices, especially against women and girls in Muslim communities. Consultations on the Declaration are currently taking place among faith leaders, NGOs, UN agencies and grassroots community groups. The Declaration is part of Islamic Relief's gender justice work which includes tackling early and forced marriage, domestic violence and female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C). Affiliated organisations[edit] TIC International Ltd[edit] TIC International[22] is a trading subsidiary of Islamic Relief. It supports they charity's fundraising activities by recycling clothes and running 14 charity shops across the UK. Humanitarian Academy for Development[edit] Formerly known as the Islamic Relief Academy, the Humanitarian Academy for Development[23] re-launched in 2018 as a centre for learning and research to benefit the humanitarian sector. Memberships and key partnerships[edit] Islamic Relief is a member of the UN's Economic and Social Council and is a signatory to the Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and NGOs in Disaster Relief. It is also a member of Bond (British Overseas NGOs for Development) and in the UK, a member of the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC), along with 14 other major charities. Islamic Relief is co-owner of the International Civil Society Centre, a global action platform, and an affiliate member of the INGO Accountability Charter Company. In 2017 it acquired Core Humanitarian Standard certification. In its Annual Report 2017[19] Islamic Relief lists its key partners as Age International, African Union, Bayt Al Zakat, CAFOD, Confederation Suisse, the UK government's Department for International Development (DFID), Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC), European Commission, Finn Church Aid, International Islamic Charity Organisation, Iraqi Red Crescent Society, Islamic Development Bank (IDB), Jordan Hashemite Charity Organisation, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, Philips, Reach Out To Asia (ROTA), Sheikh Abdullah Al Nouri Charity Society, Swedish International Development Agency (Sida), START Network, The Lutheran World Federation, UNDP, UNHCR, UNWFP, UN Women, USAID and World Vision. Islamic Relief offices and partners[edit] A 2018 map of where Islamic Relief works Awards[edit] In 2019, Islamic Relief won the BOND International Development Innovation Award for its programme Eliminating Extreme Poverty through Alternative Livelihoods for Orphaned families (ALO) in Bangladesh. Controversies[edit] In June 2014, Israel added Islamic Relief to a list of organisations banned from operating in Israel, for allegedly funding Hamas. The charity's West Bank offices were raided and their computers were destroyed, files were confiscated, and an office safe was forcibly opened. In late 2014, Islamic Relief claimed[24] that an audit carried out by an unnamed ""leading global audit firm"" found no evidence of any link to terrorism. The Israeli government responded by claiming its decision to declare Islamic Relief illegal was ""based on information that has been accumulated over years, that the fund is a central player in financing of Hamas"". The organisation has challenged the decision in the Israeli courts.[25] Subsequently, on 15 November 2014, the United Arab Emirates placed Islamic Relief on a list of proscribed organisations due to alleged links to the Muslim Brotherhood.[26][27] The organisation denies any links to the Muslim Brotherhood[28] citing the organisation's neutral stance and humanitarian nature. In 2016, it was reported that the banking group HSBC decided to sever ties with Islamic Relief over concerns that ""cash meant for humanitarian aid could potentially end up with terrorist groups abroad"".[29] HSBC invited Islamic Relief to ""end the relationship"", which the bank did in any case at the end of 2014, as it has with other aid and civil society organisations.[30] The government of Bangladesh barred the organisation from aiding the Rohingya people in Cox's Bazar, alleging funds were used to preach Islam, construct mosques, encourage radicalism, and fund militants.[31] Islamic Relief refutes these allegations and continues its work across Bangladesh, where it has been present for over 25 years.[32] In 2019 the German government allege they have ""significant personal ties"" with the Muslim Brotherhood, which was denied by Islamic Relief.[33][34] In July 2020, Islamic Relief's director Heshmat Khalifa resigned after The Times discovered he had made antisemitic remarks on his Facebook page in 2014 and 2015.[35] In an interview with The Guardian, CEO Naser Haghamed said he was ""appalled"" by the ""unacceptable posts"".[36] Miguel Ángel Moratinos, High-Representative for the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations (UNAOC), expressed dismay regarding Khalifa's outbursts, including labeling Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi a ""pimp son of the Jews"" and calling the Israeli government the ""grandchildren of monkeys and pigs.""[37] In late August, it was announced that the entire board would be resigning in what was described as ""a part of far-reaching governance reforms”.[38][39] In January 2021, the Charity Commission of England and Wales, completed a compliance case into the organisation stating that it was ""satisfied that it is making the necessary improvements in terms of the vetting of trustees, and ongoing oversight over their social media activities.""[40] Additionally, the Dutch government announced that they would give no public funds to IRW after allegations of connections to the Muslim Brotherhood in the media.[41] In late January 2021, an Independent Commission headed by former UK Attorney General Dominic Grieve, concluded that ""the offensive views articulated by the former senior director and two former trustees did not in any way compromise the impartiality or integrity of the organization’s humanitarian programmes.""[42] References[edit] ^ a b ""Charity Details"". beta.charitycommission.gov.uk. ^ a b ""Charity overview"". apps.charitycommission.gov.uk.

63,"Islands First - Wikipedia Islands First From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search This article relies too much on references to primary sources. Please improve this by adding secondary or tertiary sources. (May 2009) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Islands First is a non-governmental organization working on behalf of the Small Island Developing States to confront the challenges of climate change, the depletion of ocean resources (including ocean acidification and biodiversity loss), and ocean level's rise. Contents 1 Background and mission 2 Historical precedents for small island action at the United Nations 3 Notes 4 External links Background and mission[edit] Small island countries have been the first to suffer the negative consequences of climate change and global warming, despite bearing little responsibility for creating the problem. Islands First seeks to foster an appreciation for the need to rapidly cut carbon dioxide emissions with international policy makers. Islands First's mission is to help the small island states, who represent nearly one-quarter of the votes at the United Nations (UN), to become effective and vocal advocates for change within the most important forum for environmental progress by building the capacity of their UN missions to influence environmental policy. At over 40 nations strong, the Small Island States can become a formidable political force within the UN system. Islands First will help them realize that potential. Islands First proposes to empower the small island states to influence environmental policy through the use of some of the methods wielded so effectively by the wealthy nations. Islands First will assist the small island states by; Building the capacity of their UN missions by providing highly trained, professional advisors, Creating and sustaining strategic networks of scientific, environmental, and policy experts in order to share information and coordinate activities, and Devising comprehensive political strategies for advancing their environmental agenda. Islands First is unique among environmental NGOs in that it is being created in cooperation with, and at the request of, the small island states themselves, rather than by UN Agencies or environmental advocates. While this may seem like an academic point, it has profound practical implications. Islands First is not an endeavor seeking to impose environmentalism on a select group of states or a group of Western elites instructing nations on how to behave. Rather, Islands First originates at the request of several small island states with the goal of increasing their ability to advocate on their own behalf and cooperate more effectively with the scientific and environmental communities. Islands First seeks to link the scientific and environmental communities with the levers of power in a way never done before. With better organization and coordination among their strategic partners, the small island states hope to recast the environment and development agenda. At its outset, Islands First is working hand in hand with several UN missions in a way never before attempted in UN history. In the face of the challenges brought on by climate change, the small island states have unimpeachable moral standing as well as political will in abundance. There is simply no group of nations more appropriate to lead the fight for global environmental justice. Historical precedents for small island action at the United Nations[edit] Cooperation among the small island states, the scientific community, and the environmental community on this scale would be historically unprecedented, but it would not be the first time the small island states have mobilized politically and became powerful agents of environmental change. In fact, a concerted effort by a group of small island states put climate change on the UN agenda back in 1988, when Malta persuaded the General Assembly to recognize the potential for ""severe economic and social consequences"" from climate change. The Republic of Maldives followed suit by hosting the 1989 Small States Conference on Sea Level Rise, which resulted in the ""Malé Declaration on Global Warming and Sea Level Rise"". The Conference also saw the creation of an Action Group on climate change consisting of more than 30 small island states, later to become the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS). This momentum continued through the 1992 ""Earth Summit"" in Rio de Janeiro, where AOSIS, aided by the Foundation for Environmental Law and Development (FIELD) and other NGOs, successfully lobbied for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It was thus fitting that the Maldives became the first signatory to the third protocol of the UNFCCC, also known as the Kyoto Protocol. Similarly, the tiny Republic of Palau, with a mandate from an activist-minded President and a concerned legislature, began in May 2004 what appeared to be a quixotic effort to stop bottom trawling, an odious method of fishing that irreparably damages some of the world's most biologically diverse coral reefs and is sometimes practiced by multinational fishing corporations. Under the guidance of Palau's Ambassador Stuart Beck, a Yale-trained lawyer and Chairman of Islands First, the Palau Mission[1] and a cohort of New York University (NYU) law students worked within the UN system to change the law of the sea, not only for Palau, but for the entire world. These law students negotiated on Palau's behalf at the United Nations, interfaced with scientists and NGOs committed to eradicating the practice, and coordinated Palau's efforts with other likeminded missions. All of this hard work has already begun to pay dividends. The year 2006 saw the passage of the Nadi Declaration, which commits the sixteen members of the Pacific Islands Forum to advocate for prohibitions on bottom trawling and other destructive fishing practices in international waters, prompting the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition to issue a press statement reading:[2] ""If all nations that purport to support urgent action to protect the biodiversity of the international waters of the world's oceans from bottom trawl fishing, were as consistent and persistent as the Republic of Palau, the deep sea habitats of the high seas would undoubtedly already be safe from high seas bottom trawling."" The Palau Mission continued to push its agenda at the United Nations and played a critical role in rallying support for General Assembly Resolution 61/105,[3] which, among other things, established a new global governance regime for protecting vulnerable marine ecosystems. As reported by the BBC,[4] ""The landmark deal will restrict bottom-trawling, which experts say destroys coral reefs and stirs up clouds of sediment that suffocate marine life."" The operators of industrial fishing fleets around the world have taken notice and many have already started retooling their vessels. The result of the alliance between the Palau Mission and NYU has been one of the largest gains in ocean policy since the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea was concluded in 1982. These achievements are remarkable, not only because of their global ramifications, but because they were led by countries with very few resources at their disposal. In fact, Palau's UN Mission did not have a single paid employee during its campaign against bottom trawling. Without this newfound capacity in the form of legal advisors, improved cooperation with interested NGOs, and an ongoing dialogue with Palau's committed political leaders, none of what transpired would have been possible. These examples of political upstarts navigating a system of entrenched power vividly demonstrate what is possible at the United Nations when a committed and organized group of countries decides to act. They also illustrate why the need for an organization like Islands First is so urgent.

Man Nature and Law) is an environmentalist group in Israel. Contents 1 Tel Aviv islands 2 See also 3 References 4 External links Tel Aviv islands[edit] In November 2002 the Israeli Government appointed a six-member committee to explore the financial feasibility of creating two islands off the coast of Tel Aviv. One of the islands would be for an airport, similar to the Kobe airport in Japan, and the other island would have houses, commercial offices and tourism. Then IUED executive director Phil Warburg called the proposal a ""technological fantasy that is highly improper [because of] Israel's economic and environmental constraints.""[1] See also[edit] Alon Tal References[edit] ^ Paradise Or Fantasy?

Although the data is not evaluated for quality at this time, future iterations of this Beacon will include third party or other data that will serve to validate the information provided by the nonprofit.Analysis and ResearchLike the overall Encompass Rating System, the Culture & Community Beacon is designed to evolve as metrics are developed and ready for integration. Our partnership with Feedback Labs and Guidestar by Candid, and other partners including Fund for Shared Insight, GlobalGiving, and Keystone Accountability, enables us to launch the first version of this beacon with Constituent Feedback information collected on Candid's site.Feedback practices have been shown to support better Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion outcomes, an essential area of assessment that we intend to further expand and develop in the future. Feedback Labs has documented several studies which indicate that beyond achieving organizational goals, nonprofits that are attentive and responsive to concerns and ideas raised by beneficiaries establish stronger relationships with the people they serve, promote greater equity, and empower constituents in ways that can help to ensure better long-term outcomes.

What better place to spend your student years? Four years won’t be nearly enough time to exhaust all there is to see and do in New York City but if you’re up to the challenge, it’s definitely worth a try. Just exploring the city’s museums is an education in itself, from the Metropolitan Museum of Art to Frank Lloyd Wright’s Guggenheim. Each of the city’s neighbourhoods has its own individual character and you’re bound to find your favourite spot. You might get a taste for the hipster lifestyle in Brooklyn’s Williamsburg, or become a regular urban rambler on the well-trodden path of New York’s High Line, in the contemporary art district of Chelsea. Get free support to study in the United States Find out more For theatre fans, students in New York will often benefit from reduced ticket prices to the opera, Broadway and off-Broadway performances. Universities slightly outside the city offer the best of both worlds, with the community spirit and rural setting of a campus university with New York City an easy drive or bus journey away. While the State of New York is often overshadowed by the city that shares its name, the Finger Lakes region in particular is one of the most picturesque areas of countryside in New England. Choosing a university in New York can be a daunting task, so I've collected the best universities in the state based on the Wall Street Journal/Times Higher Education US College Rankings 2021 to help you decide. Top universities in the US Best universities in the United StatesBest public universities in the United StatesBest liberal arts colleges in the United StatesBest universities in MassachusettsBest universities in SeattleADVERTISEMENT 1. Cornell University Cornell University, founded in 1865, is an Ivy League university that consistently performs highly in world rankings. Cornell University’s 2,300-acre campus is located in the picturesque Finger Lakes region of New York State. The campus is vast enough to contain hiking trails for students to explore. Nearby Ithaca has a reputation for being a favourite with foodies.ADVERTISEMENT One of the university’s traditions is the annual Dragon Day parade in late March. Architecture students parade a giant dragon across the campus where it is pitted against a phoenix created by students from the rival College of Engineering. The university has a number of locations in New York City, including Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Science in Upper Manhattan. 2. Columbia University Located in Upper Manhattan, Columbia University is the fifth oldest university in the country and the oldest in New York State. The university was founded in 1754 as King’s College. Post-revolution, the institution was renamed Columbia College and in 1896 became Columbia University to reflect the collection of colleges that had been brought together, including Barnard College for women in 1891.ADVERTISEMENT Joseph Pulitzer founded Columbia’s prestigious School of Journalism in 1912. In the 1930s, Columbia School of Law produced two Supreme Court Chief Justices, Charles Evans Hughes and Harlan Fiske Stone. The Columbia University campus on Morningside Heights has been home to the university since 1897. The architect Charles Follen McKim was inspired by the classical architecture of ancient Greece. Columbia University Medical Centre has its own 20-acre campus in Washington Heights, two miles further north. 3. New York University Among the top institutions in New York City is New York University, located in the heart of Manhattan. Washington Square Park is the epicentre of New York University activity with many of the university’s halls and academic buildings nearby. Departments are located across the river in downtown Brooklyn. Founded by the statesman Albert Gallatin in 1831, the university was established to serve students from all walks of life. Today, New York University is among the top universities in the US in terms of academic rankings. It is also one of the largest private universities in the country with more than 44,000 students, and is a member of the prestigious Association of American Universities.ADVERTISEMENT One of the university's annual traditions is the Strawberry Festival, a chance for students to celebrate the end of exams and enjoy a slice of the longest strawberry cheesecake in New York City. ADVERTISEMENT Top universities in the US Best universities in Los AngelesBest universities in Washington DCBest universities in FloridaBest universities in CaliforniaBest universities in Texas Best universities in New York 2021 Click each institution to view its full World University Rankings 2021 profile US College Rank 2021 New York Rank  2021 University City 9 1 Cornell University Ithaca =15 2 Columbia University New York 27 3 New York University New York 49 4 University of Rochester Rochester 50 5 Colgate University Hamilton 52 6 Barnard College New York =56 7 Hamilton College Clinton 62 8 Vassar College Poughkeepsie =94 9 Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Troy =98 10 Skidmore College Saratoga Springs =121 11 University at Buffalo Buffalo =124 =12 Stony Brook University Stony Brook =124 =12 Syracuse University Syracuse 132 14 Union College Schenectady 143 15 Yeshiva University New York =158 16 Binghamton University, State University of New York Vestal 161 17 Rochester Institute of Technology Rochester =162 18 Hobart and William Smith Colleges Geneva =175 19 Sarah Lawrence College Bronxville =183 20 Fordham University Bronx =187 21 St Lawrence University Canton =193 22 State University of New York Albany Albany 200 23 Clarkson University Potsdam =220 24 Hofstra University Hempstead 223 25 Ithaca College Ithaca =227 =26 Adelphi University Garden City =227 =26 Pratt Institute Brooklyn =229 28 CUNY City College of New York New York =248 29 CUNY Bernard M.

Great Value Colleges Music Scholarship for Black Students America’s 50 Most Underrated Colleges: These Incredible Colleges Are Often Overlooked On National Ranking Lists What makes a college worth attending? There are many things, and each student is looking for something different in their college experience. One of the problems with lists that rank colleges as a whole and not on their individual areas of excellence is that some colleges are always underrepresented. This list aims to correct that. None of the colleges on this list are Ivy League institutions, but they all are able to say that they’re outperforming Ivy League colleges in some areas. Featured Programs Of course, some college statistics prove that various colleges are leading in some ways. Graduate employment rates, graduation rates, credentials of the professors and financial aid opportunities are always strong indicators of an amazing college. Therefore, this list selects colleges that have all of those things but which usually miss out on the top rankings due to the name recognition of colleges like Harvard or Stanford. The truth about college in the present day is that there are more variety and opportunity than ever before. It’s just that with traditional college rankings, those diverse colleges that are more suitable to a certain kind of student struggle to stand out. But not on this list. Instead, the colleges that usually get overlooked are shown as the fantastic places they truly are. Every single college on this list has managed to achieve something remarkable. Each college has its own unique offering that means that some students, who aren’t suitable for the most oversubscribed colleges, will find them to be perfect. But it could be that none of the colleges on this list is the right choice for you. Luckily, this list can still be a vital resource in your college search. Each entry has a detailed summary that explains why the college is underrated. These have been included so that you can find similarities with your own college options. Methodology The first step in researching this article was to find several popular lists of the best colleges in America. Then we disqualified any college that appears in the top 50 of any of those lists. After this, we started researching other colleges that have strong graduation rates, generous financial aid opportunities, incredible professors and wide-ranging graduate prospects. Lastly, we looked for the things that make them stand out that could feasibly make them more desirable for potential students than any of the top colleges on the popular top college lists. The colleges that made it into the final ranking came from lists that rank colleges just by one statistic, such as graduation rates, graduate employability, professor quality, and financial aid. Our full list of sources is as follows: College selection lists: College NavigatorTimes Higher Education, Best universities for graduate jobs: Global University Employability Ranking 2018Niche, 2020 Colleges with the Best ProfessorsStudent Loan Hero, 50 U.S. Colleges With the Most Generous Financial Aid Packages Lists where the top 50 entries were disqualified: US News, US News Best CollegesForbes, America’s Top Colleges 2019QS Top Universities, Ranked: The Top 100 US Universities The final rankings are judged by the following criteria: innovative practices at the college, graduation rates, professor quality, graduate employment rates, and financial aid rates. Our list, from 50 to one, is as follows: 50. University of Massachusetts, Boston Boston, Massachusetts Website The Boston metropolitan area is filled with incredible colleges to attend. University of Massachusetts, Boston often gets overlooked, but it has many advantages for the right student. The college is home to over 50 interdisciplinary research institutes and centers that allow students to conduct research with faculty on a wide range of topics. In fact, in the 2019 fiscal year, these institutes and centers were able to gain $50.3 million in funding. Times Higher Education states that University of Massachusetts, Boston is one of the 250 best colleges in the world for graduate employment. However, the graduation rate needs improvement. The college’s six year graduation rate is 48%, according to College Navigator. 49. University of Arizona Tucson, Arizona Website Perhaps the best indicator of University of Arizona’s respect in the world is the fact that NASA has been a long time partner with the college. In fact, the college has been heavily involved with every single planetary mission that NASA has been involved in. This incredible association is part of the reason why Niche names University of Arizona as having the 67th best college professors in America. The only downside to University of Arizona is that its graduation rates need improvement. At present, College Navigator notes that its six year graduation rate is 64%. 48. Stetson University Deland Campus, Florida Website The alumni of Stetson University have gone on to have long and successful careers. Some roles they have taken on are commissioner for Florida’s Office of Financial Regulation, the presidential envoy for hostage affairs in the US government, CEO and president of the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund, senior advisor for science and technology policy at The Center for Study of Presidency and Congress and much more. Niche names Stetson University as having the 86th best professors of any US college. The four year graduation rate at the college is 54%, and the six year graduation rate is 61% according to College Navigator. 47. University of Wyoming Laramie, Wyoming Website Thanks to the low costs and generous financial aid opportunities of University of Wyoming, over 55% of the college’s students graduate with absolutely no debt whatsoever. Wyoming residents really benefit from the college’s scholarship opportunities. In fact, any Wyoming student who graduates from high school with a GPA of 3.40, an ACT of 31 or an SAT score of 1390 or more gets a scholarship of $6,500. Wyoming students with lower scores are still eligible for smaller scholarships. The college’s affordability does not mean that the quality is anything other than first class. In fact, Niche notes that University of Wyoming has the 62nd best professors of any US college. The college’s six year graduation rate is 57% according to College Navigator. 46.

Michigan Technological University Houghton, Michigan Website The leadership team at Michigan Technological University is proud of many things. But perhaps the most impressive achievement is that their education leads to their graduates having the ninth highest early career salaries in the country, with a median of $66,400 per year. This strong starting salary is due to a number of reasons, but perhaps the most prominent is the quality of Michigan Technological University’s professors, which Niche considers to be the 59th best of any American college. The only downside to the college is the fact that the six year graduation rate is a little low compared to many colleges on this list, at 68% according to College Navigator. 44.

Niche names its professors as being the 52nd best in the entirety of the USA. 38.

The college was founded by William Egbert in 1892 as a conservatory of music and is set against the backdrop of the city of Ithaca (which is separate from the town), Cayuga Lake, waterfalls, and gorges. The college is best known for its large list of alumni who have played substantial roles in the media and entertainment industries. Ithaca College is internationally known for the Roy H. Park School of Communications, which is ranked by several organizations as a top school for journalism, film, media and entertainment.[3][4][5][6] The college has a strong liberal arts core, and offers several pre-professional programs, along with some graduate programs.[7] Ithaca College has been ranked among the Top 10 masters universities in the ""Regional Universities North"" category by U.S. News & World Report, every year since 1996, and was ranked tied at 9th for 2021.[8][9] Ithaca College is consistently named among the best colleges in the nation by Princeton Review, with the 2018 guide ranking the college number 3 for theater, number 3 for newspaper, and number 6 for Radio,[10] and is among the top schools producing Fulbright scholarship recipients.[11] Contents 1 History 1.1 Beginnings 1.2 Modern era 1.3 Presidents 2 Campus 2.1 Satellite campuses 3 Academics 4 Student life 4.1 Media and publications 4.2 Greek life 5 Athletics 6 Intramurals 7 Sustainability 7.1 Commitments to action on climate change 7.2 Energy profile 7.3 Energy investments 7.4 Community impact 8 Notable people 8.1 Alumni 8.2 Faculty 9 References 10 External links History[edit] Beginnings[edit] Boardman House, the original site of Ithaca Conservatory of Music Ithaca College was founded as the Ithaca Conservatory of Music in 1892 when a local violin teacher, William Grant Egbert, rented four rooms and arranged for the instruction of eight students. For nearly seven decades the institution flourished in the city of Ithaca, adding to its music curriculum the study of elocution, dance, physical education, speech correction, radio, business, and the liberal arts. In 1931 the conservatory was chartered as a private college. The college was originally housed in the Boardman House, that later became the Ithaca College Museum of Art, and it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.[12] Modern era[edit] Job Hall By 1960, some 2,000 students were in attendance. A modern campus was built on South Hill in the 1960s, and students were shuttled between the old and new during the construction. The hillside campus continued to grow in the ensuing 30 years to accommodate more than 6,000 students. As the campus expanded, the college also began to expand its curriculum. By the 1990s, some 2,000 courses in more than 100 programs of study were available in the college's five schools. The school attracts a multicultural student body with representatives from almost every state and from 78 foreign countries.[13] In October 2020, the college announced that 130 out of 547 faculty positions would be cut due to a need to cut $30 million from the school's budget. This is turn was said to be a result of declining enrollment. 4,957 undergraduate students enrolled for Fall 2020 versus 5,852 undergraduates in Fall 2019 and 6,101 in Fall 2018.[14] Presidents[edit] Ithaca's current president is Shirley M. Collado. She was named the ninth president of Ithaca College on February 22, 2017, and assumed the presidency on July 1, 2017. She was previously executive vice chancellor and chief operating officer at Rutgers University–Newark and vice president of student affairs and dean of the college at Middlebury College. She is the first Dominican American to be named president of a college in the United States.[15] Collado announced in July 2021 that she will step down in January to become president and CEO of College Track.[16] Collado succeeded Thomas Rochon, who was named eighth president of Ithaca College on April 11, 2008.[17] Rochon took over as president of the college following Peggy Williams, who had announced on July 12, 2007, that she would retire from the presidency post effective May 31, 2009, following a one-year sabbatical.[18] During the fall 2015 semester, multiple protests focusing on campus climate and Rochon's leadership were led by students and faculty. After multiple racially charged events including student house party themes and racially tinged comments at administration led-programs, students, faculty and staff all decided to hold votes of ""no confidence"" in Rochon. Students voted ""no confidence"" by a count of 72% no confidence, 27% confidence, and 1% abstaining.[19] The faculty voted 77.8% no confidence to 22.2% confidence.[20] Rochon retired on July 1, 2017.[21] President Life Tenure W.

The college's final academic department moved from downtown to the South Hill campus in 1968, making the move complete. Satellite campuses[edit] Besides its Ithaca campus, Ithaca College has also operated satellite campuses in other cities. The Ithaca College London Center has been in existence since 1972. Ithaca runs the Ithaca College Los Angeles Program at the James B. Pendleton Center. Additionally, there is an Ithaca College Washington Semester Program, and a recently launched Ithaca College New York City Center.[32] Former programs include the Ithaca College Antigua Program and the Ithaca College Walkabout Down Under Program in Australia. Ithaca College also operates direct enrollment exchange programs with several universities, including Griffith University, La Trobe University, Murdoch University, and University of Tasmania (Australia); Chengdu Sport University and Beijing Sport University (China); University of Hong Kong (Hong Kong); Masaryk University (Czech Republic); Akita International University and University of Tsukuba (Japan); Hanyang University (Korea); Nanyang Technological University (Singapore); University of Valencia (Spain); and Jönköping University (Sweden).[33] Ithaca College is also affiliated with study abroad programs such as IES Abroad and offers dozens of exchange or study abroad options to students.

Park School of Communications School of Health Sciences & Human Performance School of Humanities & Sciences School of Music Until the spring of 2011, several cross-disciplinary degree programs, along with the Center for the Study of Culture, Race, and Ethnicity, were housed in the Division of Interdisciplinary and International Studies; in 2011, the division was eliminated and its programs, centers and institutes were absorbed into other schools.[38] As of 2017[update], the most popular majors included visual and performing arts, health professions and related programs, business, management, marketing, and related support services and biological and biomedical Sciences.[39] Student life[edit] Media and publications[edit] Ithaca College is well known for its several prominent student-run media vehicles, including: The Ithacan is Ithaca College's official weekly newspaper that is written, edited and published by students. The Ithacan and its staff have won over 200 major collegiate journalism awards and is generally recognized as one of the top student-run newspapers in the country. Most notably, the newspaper is a consistent recipient of the Associated Collegiate Press' National Pacemaker Award; it has received the National Newspaper Pacemaker Award six times and the Online Pacemaker Award nine times (both most recently in 2015).[40] The Pacemaker has been widely considered the ""Pulitzer Prize of collegiate journalism.""[41] The Ithacan is also a five-time recipient of the Gold Crown Award from the Columbia Scholastic Press Association, most recently receiving the award in 2016.[40] The Ithacan was also ranked #3 on the 2018 Princeton Review Best College Newspaper list.[42] Ithaca College Television (ICTV) is the world's oldest student-operated college television channel. Broadcasting since 1958, ICTV is available to 26,000 cable households.[43] It is also one of the most awarded student-run television stations, with its news program, Newswatch, receiving best news telecast accolades from organizations including the New York State Associated Press Broadcasters Association, Society of Professional Journalists and Collegiate Broadcasters Inc. The show also received ICTV's first College Emmy Award from the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences.[44] ICTV is housed and operated in the Roy H. Park School of Communications. Approximately 15 to 20 production teams operate simultaneously, utilizing around 400 volunteers each semester. Programming varies by semester, but typically includes news, sports, entertainment, scripted, and podcast programs. WICB is a student-operated, 4,100 Watt FM station that serves Tompkins County and beyond, reaching from northern Pennsylvania to Lake Ontario, with a potential audience of over 250,000. The majority of programming on WICB – which broadcasts from 91.7 on the FM band – is modern rock, but the station also airs a number of specialty shows, which includes a number of genres (including blues, Broadway, jam band music and ""homeless"" music) that is not normally heard on public airwaves. Recently, readers of the Ithaca Times voted 92 WICB ""Best Radio Station."" WICB has also won the MTV U's Woodie Award for Best College Radio, while the Princeton Review ranks WICB the number one college radio station in the country.[45][46] VIC Radio[47] is Ithaca College's second student-run radio station. Previously available on 105.9 FM, VIC Radio is now an online-only radio station. It is most well known for its annual 50 Hour Marathon,[48] in which four DJs broadcast for 50 hours straight to raise money for local community organizations.[49] Buzzsaw Magazine, formerly Buzzsaw Haircut, was founded in 1999 and is an independent monthly alternative magazine written, produced and distributed by Ithaca College students. It is a progressive publication with a goal to ""publish original creative journalism, commentary and satire that works to deconstruct society, pop culture, politics, college life and dominant Western beliefs."" The faculty adviser is prominent media critic Jeff Cohen, who is also the founder of the college's Park Center for Independent Media. In 2011, the organization added a new multimedia section to Buzzsaw, titled Seesaw, dedicated to creating documentaries, radio pieces, interactive graphics, and other multimedia pieces to complement the print and online magazine. Buzzsaw has also won a number of national awards, including the Campus Alternative Journalism Project's award for ""Best Sense of Humor"" and the Independent Press Association's Campus Independent Journalism Awards for ""Best Campus Publication with a Budget Under $10,000"" and ""Best Political Commentary.""[50] Park Productions is a professional production unit within the Roy H. Park School of Communications which allows students to collaborate with faculty and industry professionals to create interdisciplinary media projects. Park Productions partners with community organizations, government agencies, and higher education institutions and has produced over 200 titles including documentaries, feature films, shorts, commercials, museum exhibits, television programs, educational, corporate, and web-based media. Awards and juried screenings include LA Webfest, Mexico International Film Festival, CINE Awards, Chicago International Film Festival, Official selections at Miami, University Film and Video Festival, Cinema in Industry Awards, Multiple International Communicator Awards, Oberhausen, Montreal, Palm Springs, and Hudson Valley Film Festivals.[51] Distinct Magazine is self described as Ithaca College's ""fashion magazine devoted to the style and culture of the students on campus...[it aims] to break gender and social class stereotypes in the fashion world, and to build a safe space for people to express themselves.""[52] Distinct was founded in 2016 by Sara Belcher and its first issue was released online in 2016. The magazine is separated into five content sections: Fashion, Beauty, Life, Culture, and Health and Fitness. Distinct is released in print twice a semester (Fall, Winter, Spring and Summer editions). Embrace is an IC magazine that aims ""to create a platform in which underrepresented students are able to see a representation of themselves on campus and within society.""[53] The magazine was co-founded by Editor in Chiefs Yetunde Smalls and Alexis Davis. The magazine is separated into content sections: LGBTQ+, Fashion, Politics and News, Mind Body Spirit, Personal Narratives and Alumni Highlight. The publication released their first in February 2016. Greek life[edit] Historically, various independent and national fraternities and sororities had active chapters at Ithaca College. However, due to a series of highly publicized hazing incidents in the 1980s, including one that was responsible for the death of a student, the college administration reevaluated their Greek life policy and only professional music fraternities were allowed to remain affiliated with the school.[54] As of 2018[update], three recognized Greek organizations remain on campus, all of which are music-oriented:[55] Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia (Delta Chapter) Sigma Alpha Iota (Epsilon Chapter) Mu Phi Epsilon (Lambda Chapter) A fourth house, performing arts fraternity Kappa Gamma Psi (Iota Chapter) became inactive in 2008. Although there are potentially plans to reactivate the chapter, it is unclear whether this will be permitted or not due to the college's policy on Greek Life.[56] However, there are various Greek letter organizations at Ithaca College that are unaffiliated with the school, and therefore not subject to the same housing privileges or rules that contribute to the safety of their members such as non-hazing and non-drinking policies.[54] Additionally, while not particularly common, Ithaca College students may rush for Greek houses affiliated with nearby Ivy institution Cornell University, subject to the rules of each individual fraternity or sorority. Some Cornell-affiliated Greek organizations actively recruit Ithaca College students. There are a few unaffiliated fraternities that some Ithaca College students join - ΔΚΕ (Delta Kappa Epsilon), ΑΕΠ (Alpha Epsilon Pi), and ΚΣ (Kappa Sigma). There are also unaffiliated sororities including - ΓΔΠ (Gamma Delta Pi).[54][57][58] Athletics[edit] Athletics and Events Center Ithaca competes in athletics at the NCAA Division III level as a members of the Liberty League and the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC). Ithaca has one of Division III's strongest athletic programs, with the Bombers winning a total of 15 national titles in seven team sports and five individual sports.[59] Ithaca was previously a member of the Empire 8.[60] The Ithaca athletics nickname ""Bombers"" is unique in NCAA athletics, and the origins of the nickname are obscure. Ithaca College's sports teams were originally named the Cayugas, but the name was changed to the Bombers sometime in the 1930s. Some other names that have been used for Ithaca College's teams include: Blue Team, Blues, Blue and Gold, Collegians, and the Seneca Streeters.[61] Several possibilities for the change to the ""Bombers"" have been posited. The most common explanation is that the school's baseball uniforms—white with navy blue pinstripes and an interlocking ""IC"" on the left chest—bear a striking resemblance to the distinctive home uniforms of the New York Yankees, who are known as the Bronx Bombers. It may also have referred to the Ithaca basketball team of that era and its propensity for half-court ""bombs"". Grumman Aircraft also manufactured airplanes including bombers in Ithaca for many years. The first “Bombers” reference on record was in the December 17, 1938 issue of the Rochester Times-Union in a men's basketball article.[62] The name has at times sparked controversy for its perceived violent connotations. It is an occasional source of umbrage from Ithaca's prominent pacifist community, but the athletics department has consistently stated it has no interest in changing the name. The athletics logo has in the past incorporated World War II era fighter planes, but currently does not, and the school does not currently have a physical mascot to personify the name. In 2010 the school launched a contest to choose one. It received over 250 suggestions and narrowed the field down to three: a phoenix, a flying squirrel, and a Lake Beast. In June 2011, President Rochon announced that the school would discontinue the search due to opposition in the alumni community.[63] Ithaca College remodeled the Hill Center in 2013. The building features hardwood floors (Ben Light Gymnasium) as well as coaches offices. The building is home to Ithaca's men's and women's basketball teams, women's volleyball team, wrestling, and gymnastics. Ithaca also opened the Athletics & Events Center in 2011, a $65.5 million facility funded by donors. The facility is mainly used by the school's varsity athletes. It has a 47,000 square foot, 9-lane 50 meter Olympic-size pool. The building also has Glazer Arena, a 130,000 square foot event space. It is a track and field center that doubles as a practice facility for lacrosse, field hockey, soccer, baseball, tennis, and football. The facility was designed by the architectural firm Moody-Nolan and began construction in June 2009.[64] Coached by Jim Butterfield[65] for 27 years, the football team has won three NCAA Division III National Football Championships in 1979, 1988 and 1991 (a total surpassed only by Augustana, Mount Union and Wisconsin-Whitewater). Bomber football teams made a record seven appearances in the Division III national championship game, the Amos Alonzo Stagg Bowl, which has since been surpassed by Mount Union in 2003. The Bombers play the SUNY Cortland Red Dragons for the Cortaca Jug, which was added in 1959 to an already competitive rivalry. The match-up is one of the most prominent in Division III college football.[66] The game alternates locations between Ithaca and Cortland, with the exception of the 2019 Cortaca Jug, which was held at Metlife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, as part of the celebration of 150 years of College Football. This game broke the record for attendance at a Division III football game as 45,151 fans attended the game, which Ithaca won. Women's soccer has won two national championships in Division III and is consistently ranked in the top 20 nationally. Gymnastics won the NCAA Division III national championships in 1998.[67][68] The men's wrestling team won NCAA Division III National Championships in 1989, 1990 and 1994. Women's field hockey won the 1982 NCAA Division III Field Hockey Championship. In 2013, Paula Miller, head of the women's swimming team completed her 30th year as head coach of the Ithaca Bombers. She has led the team to many victories. In the previous four years, the Bombers were undefeated throughout their season defeating tough competition. Ithaca has finished first or second at 25 of the past 29 state meets. The Bombers have also won the Empire 8 crown in each of the past nine seasons. The 2013–2014 season ended with regaining the NCAA Division III Championship trophy. During the 2015–2016 season the Bombers swimming and diving team held the UNYSCSA Empire 8 state champion meet in the Athletic and Events center at Ithaca College. The men's swimming and diving team scored 616.5 points, finishing 4th in states under coach Kevin Markwardt. The men's team was led by captain Addison Hebert, who was injured the first day of the meet and was able to overcome it by the last day helping the rest of the bombers get 3rd place in the 400 freestyle relay by .01 seconds. The girls' swimming and diving team scored 1227 points, winning states under Paula Miller. The bombers were to bring two women divers to South Carolina, to compete in nationals in March. During the 2017-2018 season the Bombers' Veronica Griesemer won the diving national championships. Tallman Boathouse on Cayuga Inlet The Men’s and Women’s Crew programs are housed in the Robert B. Tallman Rowing Center, a $2.6 million boathouse dedicated in 2012.[69] The new boathouse replaced the Haskell Davidson Boathouse, which was constructed in 1974 on Cayuga Inlet. The old boathouse was razed to make room for the new facility. At 8,500 square feet, the Tallman boathouse is almost twice the size of the previous structure.[69] The women's crew won back-to-back NCAA Division III Rowing Championships in 2004 and 2005. The men's crew received 4 medals at the New York State Collegiate Championships in 2008.[70] Ithaca is also home to more than 60 club sports, many of which compete regularly against other colleges in leagues and tournaments. The Men's Rugby team is of particular note, consistently earning a top-25 ranking under NSCRO. Repeating as Upstate Small College Rugby Conference champions in 2019, they earned a trip to the Northeast Regional playoff. The team finished 3rd in the region for a second year in a row. Intramurals[edit] Along with Intercollegiate athletics, Ithaca College has a large intramural sport program. This extracurricular program serves approximately 25% of the undergraduate population yearly. Fourteen traditional team activities are offered throughout the year and include basketball, flag football, kickball, soccer, softball, ultimate frisbee, ski racing, and volleyball. For most activities, divisions are offered for men's, women's, and co-recreational teams. Throughout the year usually two or more activities run concurrently and participants are able to play on a single sex team and co-recreational team for each activity. Sustainability[edit] The Peggy Ryan Williams Center is LEED Platinum Certified. Ithaca's School of Business was the first college or university business school in the world to achieve LEED Platinum Certification alongside Yale University, which had the second. Ithaca's Peggy Ryan Williams Center is also LEED Platinum certified. It makes extensive use of day light in occupied spaces. There are sensors that regulate lighting and ventilation based on occupancy and natural light. Over 50% of the building energy comes from renewable sources such as wind power. The college also has a LEED Gold Certified building, the Athletics & Events Center.[71] The college composts its dining hall waste,[72] runs a ""Take It or Leave It"" Green move-out program, and offers a sustainable living option.[73] It also operates an office supply collection and reuse program,[74] as well as a sustainability education program during new student orientation.[75] Ithaca received a B- grade on the Sustainable Endowments Institute's 2009 College Sustainability Report Card[76] and an A- for 2010. In 2017, Ithaca College was listed as one of Princeton Review's top ""green colleges"" for being environmentally responsible.[77] Commitments to action on climate change[edit] In the spring of 2007, then-President Peggy R. Williams signed the American College and University President's Climate Commitment (ACUPCC), pledging Ithaca College to the task of developing a strategy and long-range plan to achieve ""carbon neutrality"" at some point in the future. In 2009 the Ithaca College Board of Trustees approved the Ithaca College Climate Action Plan, which calls for 100% carbon neutrality by 2050. In 2009, the Ithaca College Board of Trustees approved the Ithaca College Climate Action Plan, which calls for 100% carbon neutrality by 2050 and offers a 40-year action plan to work toward that ambitious goal.[78] Energy profile[edit] The college purchases 100 percent of its electricity from renewable sources. Including offsets from a solar farm, the college's overall energy usage is 45 percent carbon neutral.[79] Energy investments[edit] The college aims to optimize investment returns and does not invest the endowment in on-campus sustainability projects, renewable energy funds, or community development loan funds. The college's investment policy reserves the right of the investment committee to restrict investments for any reason, which could include environmental and sustainability factors.[80] Community impact[edit] While the Ithaca College Natural Lands has issued a statement that Ithaca College should join efforts calling for a moratorium on horizontal drilling and high volume (“slick water”) hydraulic fracturing, or fracking,[81] the college as a whole has refused to issue a statement regarding the issue.

The college was founded by William Egbert in 1892 as a conservatory of music and is set against the backdrop of the city of Ithaca (which is separate from the town), Cayuga Lake, waterfalls, and gorges. The college is best known for its large list of alumni who have played substantial roles in the media and entertainment industries. Ithaca College is internationally known for the Roy H. Park School of Communications, which is ranked by several organizations as a top school for journalism, film, media and entertainment.[3][4][5][6] The college has a strong liberal arts core, and offers several pre-professional programs, along with some graduate programs.[7] Ithaca College has been ranked among the Top 10 masters universities in the ""Regional Universities North"" category by U.S. News & World Report, every year since 1996, and was ranked tied at 9th for 2021.[8][9] Ithaca College is consistently named among the best colleges in the nation by Princeton Review, with the 2018 guide ranking the college number 3 for theater, number 3 for newspaper, and number 6 for Radio,[10] and is among the top schools producing Fulbright scholarship recipients.[11] Contents 1 History 1.1 Beginnings 1.2 Modern era 1.3 Presidents 2 Campus 2.1 Satellite campuses 3 Academics 4 Student life 4.1 Media and publications 4.2 Greek life 5 Athletics 6 Intramurals 7 Sustainability 7.1 Commitments to action on climate change 7.2 Energy profile 7.3 Energy investments 7.4 Community impact 8 Notable people 8.1 Alumni 8.2 Faculty 9 References 10 External links History[edit] Beginnings[edit] Boardman House, the original site of Ithaca Conservatory of Music Ithaca College was founded as the Ithaca Conservatory of Music in 1892 when a local violin teacher, William Grant Egbert, rented four rooms and arranged for the instruction of eight students. For nearly seven decades the institution flourished in the city of Ithaca, adding to its music curriculum the study of elocution, dance, physical education, speech correction, radio, business, and the liberal arts. In 1931 the conservatory was chartered as a private college. The college was originally housed in the Boardman House, that later became the Ithaca College Museum of Art, and it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.[12] Modern era[edit] Job Hall By 1960, some 2,000 students were in attendance. A modern campus was built on South Hill in the 1960s, and students were shuttled between the old and new during the construction. The hillside campus continued to grow in the ensuing 30 years to accommodate more than 6,000 students. As the campus expanded, the college also began to expand its curriculum. By the 1990s, some 2,000 courses in more than 100 programs of study were available in the college's five schools. The school attracts a multicultural student body with representatives from almost every state and from 78 foreign countries.[13] In October 2020, the college announced that 130 out of 547 faculty positions would be cut due to a need to cut $30 million from the school's budget. This is turn was said to be a result of declining enrollment. 4,957 undergraduate students enrolled for Fall 2020 versus 5,852 undergraduates in Fall 2019 and 6,101 in Fall 2018.[14] Presidents[edit] Ithaca's current president is Shirley M. Collado. She was named the ninth president of Ithaca College on February 22, 2017, and assumed the presidency on July 1, 2017. She was previously executive vice chancellor and chief operating officer at Rutgers University–Newark and vice president of student affairs and dean of the college at Middlebury College. She is the first Dominican American to be named president of a college in the United States.[15] Collado announced in July 2021 that she will step down in January to become president and CEO of College Track.[16] Collado succeeded Thomas Rochon, who was named eighth president of Ithaca College on April 11, 2008.[17] Rochon took over as president of the college following Peggy Williams, who had announced on July 12, 2007, that she would retire from the presidency post effective May 31, 2009, following a one-year sabbatical.[18] During the fall 2015 semester, multiple protests focusing on campus climate and Rochon's leadership were led by students and faculty. After multiple racially charged events including student house party themes and racially tinged comments at administration led-programs, students, faculty and staff all decided to hold votes of ""no confidence"" in Rochon. Students voted ""no confidence"" by a count of 72% no confidence, 27% confidence, and 1% abstaining.[19] The faculty voted 77.8% no confidence to 22.2% confidence.[20] Rochon retired on July 1, 2017.[21] President Life Tenure W.

The college's final academic department moved from downtown to the South Hill campus in 1968, making the move complete. Satellite campuses[edit] Besides its Ithaca campus, Ithaca College has also operated satellite campuses in other cities. The Ithaca College London Center has been in existence since 1972. Ithaca runs the Ithaca College Los Angeles Program at the James B. Pendleton Center. Additionally, there is an Ithaca College Washington Semester Program, and a recently launched Ithaca College New York City Center.[32] Former programs include the Ithaca College Antigua Program and the Ithaca College Walkabout Down Under Program in Australia. Ithaca College also operates direct enrollment exchange programs with several universities, including Griffith University, La Trobe University, Murdoch University, and University of Tasmania (Australia); Chengdu Sport University and Beijing Sport University (China); University of Hong Kong (Hong Kong); Masaryk University (Czech Republic); Akita International University and University of Tsukuba (Japan); Hanyang University (Korea); Nanyang Technological University (Singapore); University of Valencia (Spain); and Jönköping University (Sweden).[33] Ithaca College is also affiliated with study abroad programs such as IES Abroad and offers dozens of exchange or study abroad options to students.

Park School of Communications School of Health Sciences & Human Performance School of Humanities & Sciences School of Music Until the spring of 2011, several cross-disciplinary degree programs, along with the Center for the Study of Culture, Race, and Ethnicity, were housed in the Division of Interdisciplinary and International Studies; in 2011, the division was eliminated and its programs, centers and institutes were absorbed into other schools.[38] As of 2017[update], the most popular majors included visual and performing arts, health professions and related programs, business, management, marketing, and related support services and biological and biomedical Sciences.[39] Student life[edit] Media and publications[edit] Ithaca College is well known for its several prominent student-run media vehicles, including: The Ithacan is Ithaca College's official weekly newspaper that is written, edited and published by students. The Ithacan and its staff have won over 200 major collegiate journalism awards and is generally recognized as one of the top student-run newspapers in the country. Most notably, the newspaper is a consistent recipient of the Associated Collegiate Press' National Pacemaker Award; it has received the National Newspaper Pacemaker Award six times and the Online Pacemaker Award nine times (both most recently in 2015).[40] The Pacemaker has been widely considered the ""Pulitzer Prize of collegiate journalism.""[41] The Ithacan is also a five-time recipient of the Gold Crown Award from the Columbia Scholastic Press Association, most recently receiving the award in 2016.[40] The Ithacan was also ranked #3 on the 2018 Princeton Review Best College Newspaper list.[42] Ithaca College Television (ICTV) is the world's oldest student-operated college television channel. Broadcasting since 1958, ICTV is available to 26,000 cable households.[43] It is also one of the most awarded student-run television stations, with its news program, Newswatch, receiving best news telecast accolades from organizations including the New York State Associated Press Broadcasters Association, Society of Professional Journalists and Collegiate Broadcasters Inc. The show also received ICTV's first College Emmy Award from the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences.[44] ICTV is housed and operated in the Roy H. Park School of Communications. Approximately 15 to 20 production teams operate simultaneously, utilizing around 400 volunteers each semester. Programming varies by semester, but typically includes news, sports, entertainment, scripted, and podcast programs. WICB is a student-operated, 4,100 Watt FM station that serves Tompkins County and beyond, reaching from northern Pennsylvania to Lake Ontario, with a potential audience of over 250,000. The majority of programming on WICB – which broadcasts from 91.7 on the FM band – is modern rock, but the station also airs a number of specialty shows, which includes a number of genres (including blues, Broadway, jam band music and ""homeless"" music) that is not normally heard on public airwaves. Recently, readers of the Ithaca Times voted 92 WICB ""Best Radio Station."" WICB has also won the MTV U's Woodie Award for Best College Radio, while the Princeton Review ranks WICB the number one college radio station in the country.[45][46] VIC Radio[47] is Ithaca College's second student-run radio station. Previously available on 105.9 FM, VIC Radio is now an online-only radio station. It is most well known for its annual 50 Hour Marathon,[48] in which four DJs broadcast for 50 hours straight to raise money for local community organizations.[49] Buzzsaw Magazine, formerly Buzzsaw Haircut, was founded in 1999 and is an independent monthly alternative magazine written, produced and distributed by Ithaca College students. It is a progressive publication with a goal to ""publish original creative journalism, commentary and satire that works to deconstruct society, pop culture, politics, college life and dominant Western beliefs."" The faculty adviser is prominent media critic Jeff Cohen, who is also the founder of the college's Park Center for Independent Media. In 2011, the organization added a new multimedia section to Buzzsaw, titled Seesaw, dedicated to creating documentaries, radio pieces, interactive graphics, and other multimedia pieces to complement the print and online magazine. Buzzsaw has also won a number of national awards, including the Campus Alternative Journalism Project's award for ""Best Sense of Humor"" and the Independent Press Association's Campus Independent Journalism Awards for ""Best Campus Publication with a Budget Under $10,000"" and ""Best Political Commentary.""[50] Park Productions is a professional production unit within the Roy H. Park School of Communications which allows students to collaborate with faculty and industry professionals to create interdisciplinary media projects. Park Productions partners with community organizations, government agencies, and higher education institutions and has produced over 200 titles including documentaries, feature films, shorts, commercials, museum exhibits, television programs, educational, corporate, and web-based media. Awards and juried screenings include LA Webfest, Mexico International Film Festival, CINE Awards, Chicago International Film Festival, Official selections at Miami, University Film and Video Festival, Cinema in Industry Awards, Multiple International Communicator Awards, Oberhausen, Montreal, Palm Springs, and Hudson Valley Film Festivals.[51] Distinct Magazine is self described as Ithaca College's ""fashion magazine devoted to the style and culture of the students on campus...[it aims] to break gender and social class stereotypes in the fashion world, and to build a safe space for people to express themselves.""[52] Distinct was founded in 2016 by Sara Belcher and its first issue was released online in 2016. The magazine is separated into five content sections: Fashion, Beauty, Life, Culture, and Health and Fitness. Distinct is released in print twice a semester (Fall, Winter, Spring and Summer editions). Embrace is an IC magazine that aims ""to create a platform in which underrepresented students are able to see a representation of themselves on campus and within society.""[53] The magazine was co-founded by Editor in Chiefs Yetunde Smalls and Alexis Davis. The magazine is separated into content sections: LGBTQ+, Fashion, Politics and News, Mind Body Spirit, Personal Narratives and Alumni Highlight. The publication released their first in February 2016. Greek life[edit] Historically, various independent and national fraternities and sororities had active chapters at Ithaca College. However, due to a series of highly publicized hazing incidents in the 1980s, including one that was responsible for the death of a student, the college administration reevaluated their Greek life policy and only professional music fraternities were allowed to remain affiliated with the school.[54] As of 2018[update], three recognized Greek organizations remain on campus, all of which are music-oriented:[55] Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia (Delta Chapter) Sigma Alpha Iota (Epsilon Chapter) Mu Phi Epsilon (Lambda Chapter) A fourth house, performing arts fraternity Kappa Gamma Psi (Iota Chapter) became inactive in 2008. Although there are potentially plans to reactivate the chapter, it is unclear whether this will be permitted or not due to the college's policy on Greek Life.[56] However, there are various Greek letter organizations at Ithaca College that are unaffiliated with the school, and therefore not subject to the same housing privileges or rules that contribute to the safety of their members such as non-hazing and non-drinking policies.[54] Additionally, while not particularly common, Ithaca College students may rush for Greek houses affiliated with nearby Ivy institution Cornell University, subject to the rules of each individual fraternity or sorority. Some Cornell-affiliated Greek organizations actively recruit Ithaca College students. There are a few unaffiliated fraternities that some Ithaca College students join - ΔΚΕ (Delta Kappa Epsilon), ΑΕΠ (Alpha Epsilon Pi), and ΚΣ (Kappa Sigma). There are also unaffiliated sororities including - ΓΔΠ (Gamma Delta Pi).[54][57][58] Athletics[edit] Athletics and Events Center Ithaca competes in athletics at the NCAA Division III level as a members of the Liberty League and the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC). Ithaca has one of Division III's strongest athletic programs, with the Bombers winning a total of 15 national titles in seven team sports and five individual sports.[59] Ithaca was previously a member of the Empire 8.[60] The Ithaca athletics nickname ""Bombers"" is unique in NCAA athletics, and the origins of the nickname are obscure. Ithaca College's sports teams were originally named the Cayugas, but the name was changed to the Bombers sometime in the 1930s. Some other names that have been used for Ithaca College's teams include: Blue Team, Blues, Blue and Gold, Collegians, and the Seneca Streeters.[61] Several possibilities for the change to the ""Bombers"" have been posited. The most common explanation is that the school's baseball uniforms—white with navy blue pinstripes and an interlocking ""IC"" on the left chest—bear a striking resemblance to the distinctive home uniforms of the New York Yankees, who are known as the Bronx Bombers. It may also have referred to the Ithaca basketball team of that era and its propensity for half-court ""bombs"". Grumman Aircraft also manufactured airplanes including bombers in Ithaca for many years. The first “Bombers” reference on record was in the December 17, 1938 issue of the Rochester Times-Union in a men's basketball article.[62] The name has at times sparked controversy for its perceived violent connotations. It is an occasional source of umbrage from Ithaca's prominent pacifist community, but the athletics department has consistently stated it has no interest in changing the name. The athletics logo has in the past incorporated World War II era fighter planes, but currently does not, and the school does not currently have a physical mascot to personify the name. In 2010 the school launched a contest to choose one. It received over 250 suggestions and narrowed the field down to three: a phoenix, a flying squirrel, and a Lake Beast. In June 2011, President Rochon announced that the school would discontinue the search due to opposition in the alumni community.[63] Ithaca College remodeled the Hill Center in 2013. The building features hardwood floors (Ben Light Gymnasium) as well as coaches offices. The building is home to Ithaca's men's and women's basketball teams, women's volleyball team, wrestling, and gymnastics. Ithaca also opened the Athletics & Events Center in 2011, a $65.5 million facility funded by donors. The facility is mainly used by the school's varsity athletes. It has a 47,000 square foot, 9-lane 50 meter Olympic-size pool. The building also has Glazer Arena, a 130,000 square foot event space. It is a track and field center that doubles as a practice facility for lacrosse, field hockey, soccer, baseball, tennis, and football. The facility was designed by the architectural firm Moody-Nolan and began construction in June 2009.[64] Coached by Jim Butterfield[65] for 27 years, the football team has won three NCAA Division III National Football Championships in 1979, 1988 and 1991 (a total surpassed only by Augustana, Mount Union and Wisconsin-Whitewater). Bomber football teams made a record seven appearances in the Division III national championship game, the Amos Alonzo Stagg Bowl, which has since been surpassed by Mount Union in 2003. The Bombers play the SUNY Cortland Red Dragons for the Cortaca Jug, which was added in 1959 to an already competitive rivalry. The match-up is one of the most prominent in Division III college football.[66] The game alternates locations between Ithaca and Cortland, with the exception of the 2019 Cortaca Jug, which was held at Metlife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, as part of the celebration of 150 years of College Football. This game broke the record for attendance at a Division III football game as 45,151 fans attended the game, which Ithaca won. Women's soccer has won two national championships in Division III and is consistently ranked in the top 20 nationally. Gymnastics won the NCAA Division III national championships in 1998.[67][68] The men's wrestling team won NCAA Division III National Championships in 1989, 1990 and 1994. Women's field hockey won the 1982 NCAA Division III Field Hockey Championship. In 2013, Paula Miller, head of the women's swimming team completed her 30th year as head coach of the Ithaca Bombers. She has led the team to many victories. In the previous four years, the Bombers were undefeated throughout their season defeating tough competition. Ithaca has finished first or second at 25 of the past 29 state meets. The Bombers have also won the Empire 8 crown in each of the past nine seasons. The 2013–2014 season ended with regaining the NCAA Division III Championship trophy. During the 2015–2016 season the Bombers swimming and diving team held the UNYSCSA Empire 8 state champion meet in the Athletic and Events center at Ithaca College. The men's swimming and diving team scored 616.5 points, finishing 4th in states under coach Kevin Markwardt. The men's team was led by captain Addison Hebert, who was injured the first day of the meet and was able to overcome it by the last day helping the rest of the bombers get 3rd place in the 400 freestyle relay by .01 seconds. The girls' swimming and diving team scored 1227 points, winning states under Paula Miller. The bombers were to bring two women divers to South Carolina, to compete in nationals in March. During the 2017-2018 season the Bombers' Veronica Griesemer won the diving national championships. Tallman Boathouse on Cayuga Inlet The Men’s and Women’s Crew programs are housed in the Robert B. Tallman Rowing Center, a $2.6 million boathouse dedicated in 2012.[69] The new boathouse replaced the Haskell Davidson Boathouse, which was constructed in 1974 on Cayuga Inlet. The old boathouse was razed to make room for the new facility. At 8,500 square feet, the Tallman boathouse is almost twice the size of the previous structure.[69] The women's crew won back-to-back NCAA Division III Rowing Championships in 2004 and 2005. The men's crew received 4 medals at the New York State Collegiate Championships in 2008.[70] Ithaca is also home to more than 60 club sports, many of which compete regularly against other colleges in leagues and tournaments. The Men's Rugby team is of particular note, consistently earning a top-25 ranking under NSCRO. Repeating as Upstate Small College Rugby Conference champions in 2019, they earned a trip to the Northeast Regional playoff. The team finished 3rd in the region for a second year in a row. Intramurals[edit] Along with Intercollegiate athletics, Ithaca College has a large intramural sport program. This extracurricular program serves approximately 25% of the undergraduate population yearly. Fourteen traditional team activities are offered throughout the year and include basketball, flag football, kickball, soccer, softball, ultimate frisbee, ski racing, and volleyball. For most activities, divisions are offered for men's, women's, and co-recreational teams. Throughout the year usually two or more activities run concurrently and participants are able to play on a single sex team and co-recreational team for each activity. Sustainability[edit] The Peggy Ryan Williams Center is LEED Platinum Certified. Ithaca's School of Business was the first college or university business school in the world to achieve LEED Platinum Certification alongside Yale University, which had the second. Ithaca's Peggy Ryan Williams Center is also LEED Platinum certified. It makes extensive use of day light in occupied spaces. There are sensors that regulate lighting and ventilation based on occupancy and natural light. Over 50% of the building energy comes from renewable sources such as wind power. The college also has a LEED Gold Certified building, the Athletics & Events Center.[71] The college composts its dining hall waste,[72] runs a ""Take It or Leave It"" Green move-out program, and offers a sustainable living option.[73] It also operates an office supply collection and reuse program,[74] as well as a sustainability education program during new student orientation.[75] Ithaca received a B- grade on the Sustainable Endowments Institute's 2009 College Sustainability Report Card[76] and an A- for 2010. In 2017, Ithaca College was listed as one of Princeton Review's top ""green colleges"" for being environmentally responsible.[77] Commitments to action on climate change[edit] In the spring of 2007, then-President Peggy R. Williams signed the American College and University President's Climate Commitment (ACUPCC), pledging Ithaca College to the task of developing a strategy and long-range plan to achieve ""carbon neutrality"" at some point in the future. In 2009 the Ithaca College Board of Trustees approved the Ithaca College Climate Action Plan, which calls for 100% carbon neutrality by 2050. In 2009, the Ithaca College Board of Trustees approved the Ithaca College Climate Action Plan, which calls for 100% carbon neutrality by 2050 and offers a 40-year action plan to work toward that ambitious goal.[78] Energy profile[edit] The college purchases 100 percent of its electricity from renewable sources. Including offsets from a solar farm, the college's overall energy usage is 45 percent carbon neutral.[79] Energy investments[edit] The college aims to optimize investment returns and does not invest the endowment in on-campus sustainability projects, renewable energy funds, or community development loan funds. The college's investment policy reserves the right of the investment committee to restrict investments for any reason, which could include environmental and sustainability factors.[80] Community impact[edit] While the Ithaca College Natural Lands has issued a statement that Ithaca College should join efforts calling for a moratorium on horizontal drilling and high volume (“slick water”) hydraulic fracturing, or fracking,[81] the college as a whole has refused to issue a statement regarding the issue.

The American Film Institute Conservatory finished as the top film school in the U.S. in TheWrap’s fifth annual ranking of programs, just ahead of previous No. 1, USC. And while the Top 10 remained fairly consistent from past years, three schools — AFI, Chapman and the University of North Carolina School of the Arts — posted their highest-ever finishes. Meanwhile, Biola University returned to the list after dropping off last year, and Pepperdine made it into our rankings for the first time. The Wrap’s annual ranking of film schools was determined by an anonymous poll of more than 2,000 entertainment industry insiders, educators, deans, filmmakers and film pundits, along with experts tasked with evaluating each school. Yes, the list compares apples and oranges, mixing undergraduate and graduate programs and including schools with more than 1,000 students and ones with less than 400. But in a time of turmoil, they are educating the storytellers we need, and we salute them all. Here’s a breakdown of the top 50 film programs in 2020: AFI Graduation 2019 / Getty Images 1. AFI Conservatory The small, elite institution that produced David Lynch, Carl Franklin, Patty Jenkins and Julie Dash — and preserved 60,000 priceless historic films now residing in the AFI Collection at the Library of Congress — has plenty to celebrate half a century after it began. It comes after a very bad period when deans came and went amid nasty controversies, and AFI fell to its lowest ranking yet on our 2019 list. But new dean Susan Ruskin, who previously put the University of North Carolina School of the Arts on the national cinematic map, rode to the rescue, and AFI shot to the top of the list for the first time ever, lauded by experts and voters in TheWrap’s poll. The proof’s in the illustrious alums like Max Barbakow and Andy Siara (Class of 2015), whose “Groundhog Day”-like film “Palm Springs” broke the record for the highest sale at Sundance, or Asher Jelinsky, Hao Zheng and Omer Ben-Shachar (Class of 2018), who swept the Student Academy Awards. With teachers like producer Lianne Halfon (“Juno,” “Ghost World,” “Art School Confidential,” “Crumb”), Oscar-nominated screenwriter Anna Thomas and ASC president and cinematographer Stephen Lighthill, it’s no wonder. This year, new voices will be joining the faculty, including Dime Davis, who recently made history as the first Black woman nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Directing for a Variety Series for “A Black Lady Sketch Show.” In AFI’s Harold Lloyd Master Seminars, fellows meet and learn from the likes of Steven Spielberg, Kathleen Kennedy, Spike Lee, Sofia Coppola, Alejandro González Iñárritu, Joel Coen, Mira Nair and Lesli Linka Glatter. And with gifts from zillionaires like David Geffen, things are looking up on the financial end, too. Also Read: AFI Fest 2020 to Close With Errol Morris Documentary 'My Psychedelic Love Story' 2. USC This year, the USC School of Cinematic Arts may have lost its almost perennial No. 1 spot on our top-film-school lists to the upstart David of AFI — but Hollywood’s Goliath is still very much standing. Its 1,700 students don’t just enter a school, they get entrée to what constitutes a miniature version of the film industry it impacts on a scale no smaller school can match. With the priciest of state-of-the-art facilities, soundstages, edit bays, scoring stage and IMAX theater, students have access to more technology than many cinema professionals, and they can access training in every aspect of the film, TV, and interactive media businesses, from pitch and script development to distribution. So what happens when it’s all shut down, as COVID controversially forced the school to do? Faculty spent their spring and summer breaks figuring out how to teach production classes online. Programs like writing, video-game design and producing, which are accustomed to online formats, adapted quickly, with students in different time zones and even different countries. And USC called in the big guns. Heavy-hitter alumni like Ryan Coogler, Stacey Sher, Kevin Feige, Tina Mabry and Judd Apatow, who were themselves pivoting during the pandemic, Zoomed in to classes and for special Q&A conversations with students. Events like graduation, film festivals and a video game expo that usually brings hundreds of participants to campus drew thousands of participants online. Though the crisis shuttered the school’s film productions (like the industry itself), and there was some reputational damage from USC scandals not SCA’s fault, Dean Elizabeth Daley — one of the most powerful fundraisers in American education — said, “We always say our students are set-ready. Now we can say they are COVID-ready, meaning they know how to work remotely and in virtual environments.” But boy, will it be better when everyone can return to campus and get back to the hard work of taking over the world. NYU Tisch School of the Arts 3. NYU NYU Tisch School of the Arts’ Maurice Kanbar Institute of Film and Television is reconvening in person for the fall semester, announcing rigorous measures to prevent, track and respond to COVID infections. NYU is offering classes in a mixed mode to enable students to participate in person or remotely, and is prioritizing flexibility should conditions change. All film classes will have a remote option, with opportunities for small group or one-on-one meetings on campus, and the school has introduced strict production rules to promote student safety. Faculty, staff and students make more than 5,000 films a year, and outside of L.A., nobody can match NYU’s parade of film geniuses: Spike Lee, Chris Columbus, Joel Coen, Morgan Spurlock, Ryan Fleck (“Captain Marvel”), cinematographer Rachel Morrison (“Black Panther”), Vince Gilligan (“Breaking Bad”), Damon Lindelof (“Watchmen”), “Pulp Fiction” editor Sally Menke and Nia DaCosta, the first Black woman to direct a Marvel film (“Captain Marvel 2”). Alum Nicole Kassell’s “Watchmen” hit the bullseye of the zeitgeist and set the year’s Emmy nomination record with 26; Jon Watts’ “Spider-Man” films have grossed over $1 billion; and Chloé Zhao’s “Nomadland” and its star Frances McDormand are front-runners at this year’s Oscars. NYU’s $2.25 million Black Family Film Foundation awards $150,000 in production grants, and the incoming freshman class in the undergraduate program is 55% female for the second year in a row. New courses: First Person Narrative, geared to individual and family stories; New Korean Cinema; and Storytelling Strategies: From Aristotle to Beyoncé and Beyond.

Chapman University Chapman University’s Dodge College of Film and Media Arts recently hired the second dean in its 25-year history, ex-Hollywood Reporter executive editor and Emmy-winning producer Stephen Galloway. New initiatives include the Master Classes, open to students and alumni, with the likes of Judd Apatow (“The 40-Year-Old Virgin”), William Friedkin (“The Exorcist”), CAA chairman Richard Lovett, producer Nina Jacobson (“Crazy Rich Asians”) and Oscar-winning costume designer Ruth E. Carter (“Black Panther”). Galloway, who ran THR’s mentorship program, introduced the new Chapman Mentorship Program to create a pipeline for brilliant youngsters from underserved communities to work with Chapman students and professors and enroll as undergraduates, with new scholarship money from producer Chuck Lorre and Spotify, among others. Also new: 16 incoming professors of color, including 11 women, and nine Black lecturers. Ex-CAA agent Joe Rosenberg and Friends producer and longtime faculty star Jill Condon are launching an ambitious careers office to connect students with internships and mentors. There’s never been a better time for a film grad to get outta Dodge — and into Hollywood. UNCSA 5. UNCSA Blessed with a low 9-to-1 student/faculty ratio, UNCSA’s School of Filmmaking looks like a little Hollywood studio lot, and it really is like one — maybe with less ruthless cruelty, though students can probably hear stories about that from A-list Hollywood survivors like Ava DuVernay. Students collaborate with UNCSA’s top-ranked School of Drama and have access to several soundstages and animation facilities. They benefit from partnerships with RiverRun International Film Festival, Sundance and others. The school covers the cost of senior thesis films and says its tuition (as low as $6,497) is about half the cost of other premiere film schools. During COVID, classes will be delivered in a hybrid of online and face-to-face components, using technologies that enable remote workflows (Frame.io and Set.a.Light 3D Studio). Interim Dean Henry Grillo helped increase enrollment 42% in 10 years, and UNCSA has expanded resources in motion-, hand-, and face-capture, effects technologies and game engine integration into filmmaking. Liked Doug Trumbull’s visual-effects work on “2001,” “Close Encounters,” “Star Trek,” “Blade Runner” and “The Tree of Life?” He’s collaborating with UNCSA to explore immersive storytelling techniques. 6. Columbia University Columbia University School of the Arts, whose 72 MFA students focus on directing, writing or producing in either traditional film or the Digital Storytelling Lab, are all out to follow in the footsteps of alumni Kathryn Bigelow, Jennifer Lee, Phil Johnson, James Mangold and “Making a Murderer” writer/directors Moira Demos and Laura Ricciardi. There’s also a BA and MA in film studies. This year, seven students had films at Toronto, six in the Cannes lineup, 23 at Sundance, 10 that would have gone to SXSW and two at the Venice International Film Festival, where four alumni won the Orizzonti Award for Best Short Film for “Darling.” Melina León’s debut, “Canción Sin Nombre (Song Without a Name)” screened at more than 80 international film festivals and won more than 30 awards, including the New Voices/New Visions Award in Palm Springs. Prof. Trey Ellis’ historical doc “King in the Wilderness” won the Emmy and his “True Justice: Bryan Stevenson’s Fight for Equality” won a Peabody, as did “The Edge of Democracy,” on which current student Moara Passoni served as an executive producer. Grads populate sets and writers’ rooms at Amazon, Disney, Hulu, Netflix, HBO, ABC, CBS, NBC and abroad. This year, School of the Arts filmmakers received five Oscar nominations (winning two), 10 Emmy nominations and three Golden Globe nominations.

UCLA UCLA’s School of Theater, Film and Television has spawned alumni both venerable (Francis Ford Coppola, Eric Roth) and au courant (Gina Prince-Bythewood, Steven Canals, Marielle Heller, Justin Lin) — and if they were there now, they’d start the year attending classes remotely. When students come back to campus (pandemic conditions permitting), they’ll plunge into the new Media Arts Lab, equipped for the production and viewing of virtual reality, augmented reality, 360-degree video, projection mapping and interactive installations. There’s good news, like the new Forever Sunny Directing Scholarship giving a lucky female filmmaker four years’ financing. But the film school’s stellar reputation took a hit from an eight-year UCLA Academic Senate review, in which eminent educators (including LMU’s film dean) found that it was plagued by feuding factions. But it also found that students praised their close advising relationships with faculty, and it seems likely UCLA’s multiprize-winning film team will take off the gloves, find peace under a new dean replacing Teri Schwartz (who left after 10 years in 2019) and soar again, while its interim dean, Brian Kite, pilots the program through the choppy waters. Another reason UCLA’s future is bright as Hollywood enters the rainbow era: More than 60% of its students and teachers are people of color. LMU dean Peggy Rajski / Getty Images 8. LMU LMU’s School of Film and Television is undeniably growing under Dean Peggy Rajski. More students, including 89 incoming graduate students, the most ever. Ten new teachers, including four faculty of color. More courses: augmented reality/virtual reality, monetizing digital content, punk and queer cinema, animators paired with English majors to improve story quality. LMU opened its expansive Playa Vista grad-school campus in 2018, and in 2021 it’s opening the 24,000-square-foot Howard B. Fitzpatrick Pavilion, with labs, an AR/VR teaching area, and an 86-seat theater. It’s grown its partnerships with Film Independent and Village Roadshow Entertainment Group to give grads mentorship and moola. Want diversity? Most of the students and 40% of the faculty are nonwhite, including screenwriting prof Michelle Amor Gillie — lead author of the famous #DearHollywood letter that helped change the place. Long before Chicago elected its first Black woman mayor, her show about one, The Honorable, was optioned by CBS. 9. CalArts Though most renowned for character animation, CalArts’ School of Film/Video has four distinct programs, all of which have churned out award-hogging alumni. Indie film writer/directors Eliza Hittman (“Never Rarely Sometimes Always”), Andrew Ahn (“Driveways,” “Spa Night”), and Nelson Carlo de Los Santos Arias (“Cocote”) are perennial favorites at Sundance. Alumni working in zeitgeisty TV include producer Rhys Ernst (“Transparent”) and director Nijla Mu’min (“Insecure,” “Queen Sugar”). CalArts is well-known for its minimalist documentary style, exemplified in the work of multidisciplinary artist Deborah Stratman and experimental filmmaker Laida Lertxundi. Mainstream animation’s gonzo cousin experimental animation trains filmmakers in stop-motion animation (Henry Selick), interactive live performances (Miwa Matreyek), and abstract and handmade films.

ArtCenter College of Design As alum Michael Bay exemplifies, it’s a good career move to train alongside advertising and graphic design people at ArtCenter or in the Media Maker’s Lab, a collaboration between advertising and film departments. You can deconstruct Coen brothers films in a Visual Literacy in Film course taught by “The Wire” writer/co-director Joy Kecken, or take ArtCenter’s newest course, Powerful Black Voices in Film, by writer/director Shannon Bennett. Director/cinematographer Ericson Core (“The Fast and the Furious,” “Point Break”) credits his success to “often grueling” ArtCenter, which “developed skills that empowered us to say what we wanted with clarity and precision.” “G.R.I.T.S. (Girls Raised in the South)” / SCAD 11. Savannah College of Art and Design SCAD’s Savannah and Atlanta programs put over 500 students a year in front of and behind the camera in Georgia’s multibillion-dollar film industry: Barry Jenkins’ “The Underground Railroad,” Ang Lee’s “Gemini Man,” Julie Taymor’s “The Glorias,” Ryan Murphy’s “The Politician” and Joan Rater and Tony Phelan’s “Council of Dads.” Samantha Geis (’18) won a 2018 DGA Award as the best female student filmmaker, and SCAD’s all-woman, African-American sitcom team produced a show called “G.R.I.T.S. (Girls Raised in the South).” More than 200 SCAD alumni and students contributed to 21 nominated films at the 2020 Oscars. There’s a full-time casting office and an annual film festival that’s screened more than 100 Oscar-nominated films. SCAD’s entertainment dean Andra Reeve-Rabb was CBS Primetime New York casting director, film and TV chair D.W. Moffett is a SAG- and Peabody-winning actor/director (“Traffic,” “Bosch,” “Chicago Med,” “How to Get Away With Murder”). 12. University of Texas at Austin The UT Moody College of Communication’s Department of Radio-Television-Film (RTF), located in what MovieMaker magazine claims is the best U.S. city in which to make movies, is certainly one of the lowest-cost schools with a first-rate reputation and starry alums: Matthew McConaughey (who teaches there, too), Wes Anderson, Renée Zellweger, the Duplass brothers, Tommy Schlamme, Jordan Levin, Jennifer Howell, Michael Barker and “Get Out” executive producer Raymond Mansfield. The department chair is Noah Isenberg, a veteran of New York’s New School and Wesleyan. RTF is one of the biggest UT departments, with 1,000 undergrads and 160 grad students; it boasts a TV Writer’s Room class that creates a season of a new show that is then pitched to major networks. RTF got Screenwriting MFA Bob Rearden an internship with Rob Thomas, then writing jobs on Veronica Mars and iZombie. He calls the department “a really great mix of both the theoretical and the practical — both of which have been essential to getting a foot in the door in Hollywood.” Also Read: SXSW 2020 Canceled After Austin Mayor Declares 'State of Emergency' Due to Coronavirus Will Packer and Kevin Hart at Florida State University / Getty Images 13. Florida State University With a 5-to-1 student/faculty ratio and tuition as low as $7,238 (in-state undergraduate), FSU launches alums who have gone on to hit the cinematic jackpot: “The Maze Runner” director Wes Ball and writer T.S. Nowlin, “Moonlight” and “If Beale Street Could Talk” director Barry Jenkins, producer Adele Romanski (Jenkins’ movies and Eliza Hittman’s “Never Rarely Sometimes Always”), “When They See Us” executive producer Jonathan King and Marvel executive Stephen Broussard. This year, veteran sound designer Pete Winter (“Ulee’s Gold,” “Ruby in Paradise”) joins the faculty. The film, engineering and computer sciences colleges collaborate on game-engine pipelines and software for previsualizing animated and live-action films. There’s a new $10,000 Torchlight Diverse Voices in Cinema Grant, an Equity Scholarship and annual diversity events. Unless things change, all experiential coursework will be face-to-face, not virtual. 14. Columbia College Chicago Columbia College Chicago’s Department of Cinema and Television Arts Department just got a new chair, Thelma Vickroy, who was the sole woman in her film class at Cal State Fullerton in the ’70s, one of three women at NYU in the ’80s and an award-winning documentarian. In her last job as cinema/TV chair at Cal State Northridge, she built a department with a growing reputation and comprising more than 50% women. Her CCC students are mentored by professionals in serious facilities, work on production lots in Chicago and Los Angeles and tap an engaged alumni network. Grads include producer/actor/screenwriter Lena Waithe (“Ready Player One,” “Master of None,” “Queen & Slim”), director Carl Seaton (“Chicago PD,” “Batwoman”), cinematographer/director/editor Michael Goi (“Glee,” “American Horror Story”), Emmy-winning cinematographer Christian Sprenger (“Atlanta”) and gaffer Cody Jacobs (“Atlanta,” “GLOW,” “Baskets”). Emerson student Georgen West wins a Student Academy Awards, 2019 / AMPAS 15. Emerson College The 1,700 students in Emerson’s Visual and Media Arts are found on its Boston home campus, noted for its new Emerging Media Lab; the beautiful 107,000-square-foot Emerson Los Angeles campus on Sunset; the Paris College of Art, partnered with Emerson on a new three-year MFA program that also involves study in Emerson’s castle in the Netherlands; and Prague’s Academy of Performing Arts for Film and Television (FAMU), where Roman Polanski began and Emerson has a summer program. Emerson, with 24% students of color and 50% women, is working to increase diversity, and the latest course is María Agui Carter’s Art of Anti-Racist Media Making. Norman Lear provides four-year scholarships for gifted students from underrepresented backgrounds. Alumni: Jay Leno, Richard LaGravenese and Adele Lim (“Crazy Rich Asians”). 16. Ithaca College Ithaca’s Roy H. Park School of Communications has sent students to jobs at dozens of high-profile TV shows, news shows, and big-deal entertainment companies. Interim dean Jack Powers, who advises CBS, ABC, FOX and Netflix on new shows (and even appeared on “Modern Family” and “The Odd Couple”), says students should prepare to do the following: “1) Spend a semester abroad in London or elsewhere interning; 2) spend a semester in Los Angeles as part of our L.A. Program and obtain one or two high-profile internships; 3) work each semester on one or more of our 20-plus television shows produced for ICTV; 4) engage in other media activities including working on-air or behind the scenes at one of our two radio stations, newspaper, alternative magazine, professional communications production company, etc.” There are 13,000 Park grads out there to reach out to, many in New York and Los Angeles industry strongholds. Boston University alumni Josh and Benny Safdie / Getty Images 17. Boston University Though BU’s College of Communications’ film and television programs have been impacted by COVID-19, the school has managed to continue teaching production courses in person to 650 undergrads and 80 M.S., M.A., and M.F.A. students. The program focuses on four critical areas: studies, writing, production and management/producing. Students explore the history of both film and television mediums to learn from those who came before them, practice the art of storytelling through their screenwriting courses, then apply what they learned in their production courses. BU FTV alums include Paramount chief Jim Gianopulos, “Uncut Gems” auteurs Josh and Benny Safdie, Bonnie Hammer and Bonnie Arnold. 18. Northwestern University COVID failed to sidetrack Northwestern’s Department of Radio/Television/Film, which hooks up its budding writers, actors, and directors with Chicago’s vibrant arts scene. Recent alum highlights: Will Arbery was a Pulitzer finalist for “Heroes of the Fourth Turning”; Attica Locke was a writer and producer on Hulu’s “Little Fires Everywhere” and Netflix’s “When They See Us”; Jenny Hagel, Jen Spyra, Ally Hord, Seth Meyers, and Stephen Colbert were Emmy nominees; Desus and Mero writer Ziwe Fumudoh hosts a viral sensation Instagram Live show; and recent grad Charlie Hall’s web series “Sorry, Charlie” has been viewed more than 50,000 times. Professor Jeffrey Sconce got the department’s eighth Guggenheim, Thomas Bradshaw was a consulting producer on “When They See Us” and three films by faculty member Stephen Cone were featured in the Criterion Collection. Also Read: Film Schools Brace for Virtual Classes and New Production Protocols “Dreamcentered” by Maia Buljeta and Kaija Harrison / Rhode Island School of Design 19. Rhode Island School of Design RISD was recently rated the fifth-best art school in America, and that context informs its film/animation/video department. Star alumnus Gus Van Sant is a Hollywood great, but he remains a painter and visual artist at heart (and his remake of “Psycho” was a Warhol homage). Like many RISD talents (say, his classmate David Byrne), he’s out to radically reimagine the world through his art. “Film is a device for communication and a platform for change,” said current student Maia Buljeta, who made the animated documentary “Dreamcentered” with classmate Kaija Harrison using illustrations by kids from Providence’s refugee center. RISD is re-imagining itself during COVID by “de-densifying” its campus and instituting disinfecting regimens. The bright side: It’s easier to get visiting academics and critics to participate online than it was in person. 20. Syracuse University SU’s Department of Transmedia has produced industry leaders now running things at DreamWorks, Pixar, Sony Pictures, Yahoo, Apple, Showtime and HBO. Grads have screened their films at Sundance, Slamdance, MOMA and the International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam. Besides the six-week summer L.A. Semester internship program, SU students study in London, Prague, Florence, Bologna, Venice, Santiago, and Moscow. Alumni include Lila Yacoub and Danny Zuker. CSUN student film Amal by Dilek Ince 21. California State University, Northridge CSUN’s Department of Cinema and Television Arts (CTVA) trains students in the art, craft and technology of filmmaking, television production (narrative and documentary), screenwriting, VR and emerging media, entertainment media management and media theory and criticism. The department boasts two dedicated soundstages and a new green-screen stage and VR lab. This academic year, its emerging media program will be rolling out classes in Unity’s VR development platform for shooting live mo-cap in real-time environments. VFX producer Brooke Noska (“American Horror Story,” “Barry”) got an Emmy nomination for “The Orville,” and editor Ryan Malick (“Project Runway,” “RuPaul’s Drag Race”) got his fifth in eight years, and his first win. Dilek Ince ’18 won a DGA Student Award and the BAFTA for her short film “Amal”; Jared White’s “100 Years From Home” premiered on PBS; and MFA screenwriting grad Talicia Raggs is writing the CBS pilot for “Never Tell,” an upcoming series based on Stacey Abrams’ best-seller. 22. Ringling College of Art and Design Now 15 years old, the Ringling Film Department headed by Bradley Battersby has a new Studio Labs Soundstage and Post-Production Complex, permitting students to continue film production while allowing for 36,000 square-feet of social distancing. The three-building complex provides five large soundstages for set construction and production, multiple edit suites, dubbing and Foley stages, live mix and pre-recording suites, a color correct theater, classrooms and meeting spaces. The fall term concentrates on preproduction courses (screenwriting, business, production planning and design), a mix of one-on-one instruction, online lectures and in-person studio instruction. Students have worked on recent films with Beau Bridges, Kevin Smith, Dylan McDermott and Justin and Christian Long, and graduates work in animation at Pixar, Blue Sky Studios and Paramount. Dozens of guest artists have done virtual lectures and workshops during the epidemic. 23. Wesleyan University What’s a first-rate film program doing at a liberal arts college for brainiacs? Thank the founder of Wesleyan’s College of Film and the Moving Image, Jeanine Basinger. A student of hers said, “It’s an example of a small college taking a chance on a woman lecturer who made up in enthusiasm for what she lacked in formal academic credentials, sticking with her through her doctoral thesis, and eventually awarding her tenure. In return, she oversaw the creation of the most innovative film studies program in the country. Believe me when I say this could not have happened at Yale.” There’s a new, 16,000-square-foot Basinger Center for Film Studies with a soundstage and theater. Alumni include Michael Bay, Joss Whedon, Akiva Goldsman, D.B. Weiss, Lin-Manuel Miranda and Jon Turteltaub. 24. UC Santa Barbara Despite COVID, UCSB’s Carsey-Wolf Center, endowed by Marcy Carsey and Dick Wolf, is still an important place in the film world — it recently hosted New York Times critic Manohla Dargis and Alison Kozberg’s virtual lecture “Moviegoing in the Age of COVID-19.” UCSB hosts the excellent AFI Routledge film book series and gives students entrée to Hollywood. Said film and media major Kyrié Howard, who interned at J.J. Abrams’ Bad Robot Productions, “During my internship, I was able to help with some of the projects, including a campaign video for Michelle Obama. Once a week, we also had lessons where we were taught about production, setup and even worked on content for their social media platforms.” Also Read: How the ShortList Film Festival Finalists Overcame Dark Subject Matters, Unexpected Production Challenges (Video) Stanford’s Jeff Orlowski photographed by Chris Loupos for TheWrap 25. Stanford University Even if you’re not one of the eight students accepted into Stanford’s MFA program in documentaries — famously the strength of its film department, whose grads often get their films on PBS and in film festivals, win scads of Student Academy Awards and get hired by HBO and others — you can be an undergrad filmmaker and do fine. And the proximity to the Stanford-spawned Silicon Valley scene can’t hurt. Jeff Orlowski’s undergrad work led to his documentary on vanishing glaciers, “Chasing Ice,” which won at Sundance, SXSW and the Emmys and was nominated for an Oscar. It also landed him work with Apple, National Geographic and Obama’s White House. Then he made a social-media doc, “The Social Dilemma,” with his Stanford pal and Google ethicist Tristan Harris. “Many of my friends went to work at different tech companies coming out of school. I went down the film route,” said Orlowski, who used film to change the world. 26. University of Arizona “When you look at the films that have come out of this program in the last 10 years, you realize a good story and a little savvy go a long way,” said Adrian Meyer, a 2020 grad from UA’s School of Theater, Film and Television. It’s a real community: When the pandemic shut down mixing stages, prof Lisanne Skyler got her Emmy-winning sound mixer friend Scott Weber (“Westworld,” “Lost”) to create a virtual mixing platform connecting UA filmmakers to his Burbank studio to complete their films in Dolby 5.1 for the first online edition of its annual film showcase I Dream in Widescreen — normally a capacity event at the Fox Tucson Theatre. In the two-day digital fest organized by new advancement director Kerryn Negus and kicked off by Netflix’s Scott Stuber, online audiences listened to conversations with UA alumni: Lindsay Utz, editor of Oscar-winning “American Factory,” “Scream 5”‘s Tyler Gillett, Sundance programmer Mike Plante, WME partner Brad Slater, casting director Eyde Belasco (“Sorry to Bother You,” “Transparent”) and YouTube star Darious Britt. The school has a social conscience, as evidenced by alumna showrunner Sierra Ornelas (“Superstore,” “Brooklyn Nine-Nine,” “Rutherford Falls”) and her #Donation4NavajoNationChallenge, which raised $250,000 for medical supplies, PPE and other lifesavers for Navajo citizens. Los Angeles Film School’s Spotlight Awards / Getty Images 27. Los Angeles Film School Located in the historic RCA Building and environs on Sunset, the for-profit Los Angeles Film School is at the heart of the industry and offers both online and on-campus instruction. No ivory tower, it’s meant to “bridge the gap between the entertainment industry and its instruction.” This year, more than 30 alumni worked on 35 productions that earned 193 Emmy nominations. Distinguished grads include Oscar-nominated editor Martin Pensa (“Dallas Buyers Club,” “Wild”), Emmy-winning “Saturday Night Live” director Osmany Rodriguez and computer animation grad Damian Szeibert, a 3D modeler and sculptor who brings Disney and Pixar characters to life.

Pratt Institute Pratt sent two films to Sundance this year: alum Michael Dweck’s “The Truffle Hunters” and professor and writer/director Eliza Hittman’s “Never Rarely Sometimes Always,” which won honors there and also at the Berlin and Zurich film fests. Alum Liz Hannah, after working in development for Charlize Theron’s company, struggled for years as a screenwriter, then had her spec script “The Post” land at No. 2 on the Black List and get snapped up by Amy Pascal for Steven Spielberg to direct. He got an Oscar nomination, she a Golden Globe nom and a WGA award. “I’m the one in a million,” Hannah said. True, but other Pratt grads show films at Toronto and Tribeca, or work at MTV, USA Networks, Entertainment Weekly or the New Yorker. 29. San Francisco State University Founded in 1967, the School of Cinema teaches history, theory, criticism and production to develop students’ personal voices. During the pandemic, there’s still a monthly screening from the Archive Project, focused this year on race, rebellion and resistance. The $10 million Marcus Fund for Excellence in Cinema renovated facilities, bought new ARRI, 16mm and VR/AR cameras and endowed two new Chairs in Social Justice Fiction Filmmaking (Mayuran Tiruchelvam) and African American Cinema Studies (Artel Great). Alumni include Kristy Guevara-Flanagan, the late Barbara Hammer, Debbie Lum, Steven Okazaki, Jonas Rivera, Cauleen Smith and Steven Zaillian. 30. Rutgers Rutgers Filmmaking, part of the Mason Gross School of the Arts, operates on a conservatory model at a Big Ten research university of 40,000 souls. Two hundred applicants vie for 26 spots in Rutgers’ film program, which is located at its New Brunswick campus, and applications are growing 28% annually. The Documentary Film Lab, led by Thomas Lennon (who’s won an Oscar and two Emmys and sent two films to Sundance) sends students to work on projects from Antarctica to Zambia. Alum Zack Morrison won the College Emmy awards, and three students went to the Telluride Film Festival Student Symposium. Thanks to the recently opened New Brunswick Performing Arts Center, Rutgers Filmmaking now has a 300-seat movie theater. There’s a new $20,000 graduating student film grant with access to Rutgers production facilities. Students and grads work at SNL, MUBI, CNN, Disney, CBS, Sony Pictures, Panasonic, NBC, BBC, Searchlight and the Tribeca Film Festival — and recent grads are working on Debra Granik’s next film. John Waters’ commencement address at SVA 31. School of Visual Arts At SVA’s 2020 commencement — which was virtual instead of at Radio City Music Hall — speaker John Waters hailed the graduates as “COVID-19 commandos” and said, “You can change history with one ludicrous idea. While you’re still young, maybe it’s time to become a virus yourself — a good kind of virus, one fueled by the years of hard work you put in at the incubator known as the School of Visual Arts. Artists, you are the cure, too. The only people that can inspire the world to notice and then alter its destructive behavior.” SVA screenwriters typically graduate with two full-length screenplays, a TV spec script or pilot, an adaptation and a trove of short scripts. Grads wind up at Disney Animation Studios, DreamWorks, Warner Bros. Animation, Blue Sky Studios, Nickelodeon, Lucasfilm Animation and Sony Pictures Animation. Alum Joe Ralko took a finance-office clerk job on CBS’ “Blue Bloods” and wound up selling his film to DirecTV. Alumni from the for-profit school include Harris Savides, Bryan Singer, the late Lynn Shelton, “Homeland” director Michael Cuesta and “Lars and the Real Girl” director Craig Gillespie. 32. University of Miami Sure, UM is proud of alums Stallone and the Rock — but there’s more to the place than that, said Miami Department of Cinematic Arts chair Christina Lane, whose terrific new book, “Phantom Lady: Hollywood Producer Joan Harrison, the Forgotten Woman Behind Hitchcock” is a fit rival to UM teacher Scott Eyman’s new book “Cary Grant: A Brilliant Disguise.” For starters, there are alums Kyle Patrick Alvarez (“13 Reasons Why,” “Stanford Prison Experiment”), Ozzy Inguanzo (“Bathtubs Over Broadway”) and Omar Lugones (“Celebrity Justice”) and “Brain Games” host Jason Silva. Or midcareer alumni on the business side: Sony’s John Weiser, Orion’s John Hegeman and Epix’s Rachel Brill. Students win multiple Sundance honors, and two sold their thesis films to HBO. Heading the Games Division is Lindsay Grace, who won the Games for Change Festival Vanguard Award. Despite COVID, UM teacher Betsy Helf Mateu said, “We’ve prepared our students well enough to have the skills to adapt as the industry emerges from this.” 33. Hofstra University Hofstra’s Lawrence Herbert School of Communication offers proximity to New York’s film scene, and starting their first year, students have full run of three soundstages at the school, as well as a Foley/ADR studio and a postproduction color-correction suite. Hofstra has programs in Los Angeles, Cuba, Rome and New York, and alumni to emulate: Francis Ford Coppola, Phil Rosenthal, Avi Arad, Paramount Television’s Debra Bergman, Dick Clark Production’s Mark Bracco, Magical Elves’ Jo Sharon, Dawn Olmstead (UCP and Wilshire Studios), Steve Kullback (“Game of Thrones”) and rising stars like Dan Farah (“Ready Player One”), Brit DeLillo (“Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey”), Black List-noted screenwriter Ben Mehlman (“Whittier”) and show creators like Kieran Valla (“Little Demon”). 34. University of California, Berkeley The Department of Film & Media Department’s new chair is Jeffrey Knapp, who used to run Berkeley’s English department (ranked No. 1 in America) and who just published his first movie book, “Pleasing Everyone: Mass Entertainment in Renaissance London and Golden-Age Hollywood.” Clearly, the scholarly side of this Bay Area cinema hotbed, where Film Quarterly and at least three other major journals were born, is in good hands. The film department also collaborates with the top-rated journalism school, so Berkeley is a documentary powerhouse, with lecturer Carrie Lozano recently appointed director of the Sundance Institute’s Documentary Film Program. Over 20 Berkeley journalism grads got 2020 Emmy honors. In one week this July, PBS aired two docs worked on by Berkeley students, both from its Chronicling COVID-19 project, and Netflix’s recent doc “The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez” came from UC Berkeley’s Investigative Reporting Program. 35. Stony Brook University The Stony Brook Manhattan Center for Creative Writing and Film, led by Magdalene Brandeis, boasts artistic director Christine Vachon of Killer Films and TV writing chief Alan Kingsberg, who was lured away from Columbia and has created a new MFA program. His 4-year-old undergrad program’s first graduating class has a writer working at Levinson/Fontana on Showtime’s “City on a Hill.” James Sharpe ’18 single-handedly produced “Tom of Your Life,” which Richard Roeper calls one of his favorite films of 2020. Instruction is mostly online, with some in person; the pandemic has increased guest speakers (John Sloss, Ted Hope, James Schamus, Janet Pierson, Michael Arndt, UTA’s Rena Ronson and Endeavor Content’s Kevin Iwashina) and Brandeis said there’s a post-COVID uptick in the number and quality of applicants. New this fall: the eight-month Social Impact Filmmakers certificate program.

DePaul University Chicago may be far from Hollywood and Manhattan, but it’s a regional production giant. DePaul School of Cinematic Arts students prepare to join the industry at a little film studio of their own, with three soundstages, green-screen cycloramas, a scenic shop, Arri and RED cameras, a three-ton grip truck, motion-capture and stop-motion stages, and editing suites and mixing studios. The facilities are located at the Loop Campus and at DePaul’s 32,000-square-foot production facility in Cinespace Chicago Film Studios, which is also used by “Fargo,” “Empire” and Dick Wolf’s Chicago shows. There’s a joint program with Second City (which spawned Stephen Colbert and Tina Fey). Alexis Auditore, a member of SCA’s first graduating class, directs physical production at Marvel Studios Streaming; alum Daniel Willis grew up on the South Side and now directs for “Grey’s Anatomy.” 37. New York Film Academy The for-profit film school with programs in L.A., Miami, Australia, Florence, Beijing and Shanghai sends its grads’ films to the Sundance, Toronto, Cannes, SXSW and Venice film festivals. Recent NYFA alums helped bring you “Tiger King” and Awkwafina’s “The Farewell.” “The Devil All the Time” director Antonio Campos got his start at NYFA — at age 13. “I lied about my age,” he said. Since the pandemic, NYFA added 16 online filmmaking workshops in four-to-15-week stints. 38. School of the Art Institute of Chicago The SAIC Film, Video, New Media, and Animation department (FVNMA) was going great guns until the pandemic trimmed revenue by a projected $25 million, causing the loss of over 100 jobs and temporary closure of the Gene Siskel Film Center, the public face of SAIC. But director Jean de St. Aubin said the school is “not in jeopardy. We had a board meeting and the feeling was unanimous: We’re going to get through this.” SAIC’s Black Harvest Film Festival was rescheduled from August to November, and though the Siskel Center is dark, SAIC’s Film Center From Your Sofa streams on, with Facebook filmmaker Q&As to watch in your sweatpants. University of Pennsylvania alum Bruce Dern 39. University of Pennsylvania The University of Pennsylvania film program traces its roots back to the pre-film days of Eadweard Muybridge. Today, Penn offers a full curriculum in production, animation, screenwriting, virtual reality, game design and history and theory. The programs take students to the Cannes Film Festival annually and offer summer internships and an annual screenwriting contest that arranges for the winners to pitch their scripts. Notable alumni include former studio heads Stacey Snider and Rich Ross, actors Bruce Dern, Elizabeth Banks and Candice Bergen, producers Todd Lieberman and Michael Rauch and writer Matt Selman. 40. American University The AU School of Communication Film and Media Arts division offers bachelor’s and master’s degrees in media arts and production. At the nation’s red-hot political center, it’s all about film’s impact on society. The MA in production is a 24-month program, the MFA in film and media arts a 36-month one. There are concentrations in environmental and wildlife filmmaking; political, cultural and social impact; art in entertainment; or games and interactivity. AU also has a partnership with the Film and TV School of the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague. 41. University of Michigan The Department of Film, Television and Media at the University of Michigan’s College of Literature, Science, and the Arts has a world-class Orson Welles archive and sends alums to positions of power at Netflix, AMC, Comedy Central, Fox, Amazon and Warner Bros. Their pilots sell to HBO, AMC, and Hulu. They write for “black-ish,” “House of Cards” and “One Day at a Time.” “The program at Michigan really helps prepare you for the industry,” said Kelci Parker, senior manager of comedy originals at Hulu. “You’re told ‘no’ the same way you are in Hollywood. You get real budgets, and you have to figure that out. All of my friends who came out of Michigan are working in L.A. or New York and are really successful.” 42. Full Sail University Full Sail’s undergrad and graduate film programs balance the creative aspects of world building and storytelling with the practical aspects of running a production. At this year’s Academy Awards, 149 graduates were credited on 24 nominated films, and 40 of them had credits on Oscar-winning films. Gary Rizzo won Oscars for sound mixing for both 2011’s “Inception” and 2018’s “Dunkirk.” In 2019, more than 200 Full Sail grads worked on Emmy-nominated shows, including “Game of Thrones,” “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,” “Ozark” and “The Handmaid’s Tale.” Notable alumni include director/writer/editor Steven C. Miller, director/screenwriter Darren Lynn Bousman and assistant director Larry Katz.

University of Colorado, Boulder UC Boulder’s Cinema Studies & Moving Image Arts BA and BFA programs are all about immersive filmmaking. Students are required to learn screenwriting, producing, directing, editing, and sound mixing. Boulder loves analog filmmaking: Along with a state-of-the-art digital cinema experience (including the RED camera, green screens and AVID), students can work in forms that include Super 8, 16mm, 35mm, hand-drawn and stop-motion animation. Alumni include “South Park” creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, director Derek Cianfrance (“I Know This Much is True,” “The Place Beyond the Pines”), producer Alexis Martin Woodall (“Glee,” “American Horror Story”) and film editor Nick Houy (“Little Women,” “Lady Bird”). 44. Colorado Film School CFS is, said director Brian Steward, “dollar for dollar, the best bargain in film schools — and the best film school for 800 miles in any direction.” State residents can get a two-year certificate in film for $9,500. (It’s $31,500 for outsiders.) The acting/directing faculty boasts Galina Boulgakova, a graduate of the Moscow Art Theater School, where the Stanislavski System originated. Skype and Zoom keep students in touch with Steward’s industry contacts and others, like “Dark Knight” executive producer Michael Uslan and “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” director of photography Rick Page. Biola 45. Biola You wouldn’t think the executive who made AMC vital by programming “Mad Men,” “Breaking Bad” and “The Walking Dead” would quit to become the dean of a Christian school’s new School of Cinema and Media Arts, but that’s what Tom Halleen just did. You might think Christian film is a negligible market, but it actually brings in more than $5 billion a year. And you might think that Biola is puny, but it’s got dozens of faculty, and Halleen oversees a $76 million building project for a 50,000-plus-square-foot soundstage, theater, classroom and office complex. Internships are required, and done at Bad Robot, Netflix, Amazon, the Television Academy and the DGA. Arizona State University 46. Arizona State University ASU’s Herberger Institute’s film program is pretty big, with over 1,000 students and many heavy-hitting, Oscar-bedecked visiting speakers, but wait until its new $73.5 million, 118,000-square-foot digital innovation hub opens (perhaps in 2022), with theaters, movie-production studios and soundstages. ASU Herberger is also helping turn L.A.’s old Herald Examiner Building into a new 80,000-square-foot satellite campus. ASU’s Film Spark program has connected ASU students with 10 Oscar winners and nominees, three studio chiefs, DGA and AMPAS presidents and alums like Lionsgate vice chair Michael Burns. USC-trained former USC and LMU film prof Adam Collis said, “While ASU is not at the USC/LMU level, something very special is happening in Tempe.” 47. Pepperdine Perched in heavenly hills over Malibu, Pepperdine’s students are 53% Christian and 88% say diversity is a Pepperdine core value. So whether you’re a faith-fueled filmmaker or not, you won’t get thrown to the lions — unless you’re a grad who lands a job in Hollywood, as many do. It’s less than 30 miles away, so teachers and visitors have included Robert Altman, Morgan Freeman, Dick Van Dyke, Garry Marshall, Amy Ephron, Lester Holt, Randall Wallace and WGA West’s Chuck Slocum. Alumni: “The Walking Dead” producer Denise Huth and action director D.J. Caruso. 48. Mount St. Mary’s University Students get small class sizes and access to a production studio in the heart of Hollywood. The university’s production workshop experience places students in a writers’ room environment to create episodic content, which is then filmed on historic locations and studio backlots for an immersive professional experience. Programs include undergraduate degrees in film, journalism, professional photography, and B.S. degrees in film, media and social justice. In addition to the M.F.A. in film, television and photography, MSMU’s graduate offerings expanded this year to include their new M.F.A./M.B.A. combined degree in producing for film and television. University of Michigan alum Willem Dafoe 49. University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee Milwaukee’s $1.5 billion film industry employs more people than its famous breweries, and film job growth is twice as fast as the overall employment rate. UWM’s Peck School of the Arts’ Department of Film, Video, Animation and New Genres is at the center of the scene, tied to the Milwaukee Film Festival, Wisconsin Film Festival, Milwaukee Art Museum and UWM Union Cinema, one of 23 theaters nationally recognized by the Sundance Film Institute Art House Project. Noted for a tradition that blends the practical and the wildly experimental, UMW produced Willem Dafoe and “The Lord of the Rings”‘ Oscar-winning VFX man Jim Rygiel. 50. John Hopkins University/MICA Johns Hopkins University partners with Maryland Institute College of Art for a film program centered at the $10 million, 25,000-square-foot Hopkins- MICA Film Center. At Hopkins’ famous Peabody Institute, Thomas “She Blinded Me With Science” Dolby runs a Music for New Media program to train students to make innovative sounds for film, television, video games and virtual reality.

European Region of the International Lesbian and Gay Federation; Amnesty International; International Action for Peace and Sustainable Development; Minority Rights Group; International Commission of Jurists;

General Debate on Human Rights Bodies and MechanismsThe general debate on human rights bodies and mechanisms started in a previous meeting and a summary can be found here.Speakers stressed the importance of the Special Procedures system - an indispensable piece of the United Nations human rights architecture that called out human rights violations in every part of the world.  Questioning the very legitimacy of the system was a smokescreen for human rights abusers to continue doing so with impunity.  Speakers noted the importance for States to send out a standing invitation to all mandate holders and Special Procedures - all countries were urged to do so.  Supporting the integrity and independence of the mandate holders, as well as ensuring their finances, was the responsibility of States.  Mandate holders must be equipped fully with all the necessary resources needed to carry out their work.  Acts of intimidation or reprisals against those seeking to cooperate with mandate holders must be condemned in the strongest terms by all States, investigated, and brought to the attention of the Council.  The working methods of the Consultative Group were welcomed by speakers, who hoped they would lead to increased trust with the mandate holders and better cooperation on the part of the States.  Speakers highlighted the efficiency with which mandate holders were able to adapt to the COVID-19 crisis.  Speakers welcomed the recommendations made by the Forum on Minority Issues, specifically the recognition of lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and intersex people as one the populations that were particularly vulnerable to hate speech on social media platforms.  In many States, such hate speech was indirectly legitimised by State officials who used exactly the same means to dehumanise communities; when people in power used hate speech against any community, it fostered a sense of impunity that could translate into real-world harm.  As a result, transgender communities in particular were under attack across the world.  Speakers regretted the actions and statements made by some States during the forty-sixth session of the Council - they were aimed at undermining the authority of the Council and the independence of the mandate holders.  States and the Council must take a strong proactive stand against this trend.  Mandate holders must be allowed unfettered access to all occupied territories.  Multiple speakers noted the worrying rise of attacks against human rights defenders around the world.Democracies were under threat during the COVID-19 pandemic - the responsibility of the Council was even more vital.  Cross-border migration movements were used as a pretext to crackdown against minorities that had been marginalised for decades.  Stressing the crucial importance of democratising the multilateral trade system, notably to expand the voting rights of countries from the South, speakers said agreements between the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the United Nations should be reviewed accordingly.  Extending a standing invitation to all Special Procedure mandate holders should be a prerequisite for a country wishing to be elected to the Council.  Speakers regretted that some Member States were continuously ignoring the Council and its mechanisms.  National mechanisms for implementation, reporting and follow-up could play an important role in improving implementation of human rights recommendations by joining them up with comparable targets of the Sustainable Development Goals and allowing for a coordinated and all-government approach to their implementation. General Debate on the Universal Periodic Review MechanismSpeakers said all United Nations Member States must follow-up in an effective manner on the recommendations received through the Universal Periodic Review.  They condemned all kinds of reprisals against individuals, non-governmental organizations and other stakeholders cooperating with the United Nations human rights mechanisms.  Speakers urged those present to uphold the principles of universality, transparency and equality in the context of the Universal Periodic Review, which had strengthened the human rights framework in several countries.  A spirit of constructive engagement should continue to guide its future work.  It was essential for the success of this mechanism to continue to provide capacity building programmes for the benefit of those States that expressed the need.  This should be done with the consent of the State, in particular of developing countries and small island developing States.  Speakers called on those present to remain vigilant lest the Universal Periodic Review be misused and manipulated.  Given the current pandemic, it was urgent that human rights mechanisms delivered on their mandates; financial support should be provided to the Universal Periodic Review.The Universal Periodic Review process should consider all human rights in equal measure.  Lack of progress in implementing recommendations was often due to lack of capacity, not lack of willingness to advance human rights.  Speakers reiterated their concern about the sending and publication of letters to the countries, giving priority to some recommendations and ignoring others - a counterproductive practice inherited from the previous High Commissioner.  They invited States to integrate commitments stemming from the Nairobi Summit on the International Conference on Population Development in their national mechanisms for reporting and follow-up and in their national implementation plans.  Women and girls were further exposed by the financial consequences of the COVID-19 crisis and gender-based violence was on the rise as speakers encouraged States to end all forms of discrimination and address the paid and unpaid care economy.  Many human rights defenders were intimidated and harassed all across the world.  Radical solutions to guarantee the rights of stateless persons were required as the Council was urged to intensify efforts to address statelessness and end the suffering of stateless persons.States were urged to end the use of unilateral coercive measures as speakers emphasised the negative effects of sanctions on the ability of peoples in affected countries to enjoy their right to health, cutting the supply of, and access to medicine.  Long-existing structural racism had led to the rise of discrimination against Asian minorities in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in some countries.  The international community must bring pressure to bear on States to accede to the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees.  The Universal Periodic Review offered an important space to address violations against the over 260 million people across the globe who were discriminated against based on work and descent: the imposition of social inequalities because of birth into certain descent or caste systems had drawn parallels with the system of apartheid.  With this in mind, speakers noted that most consultations associated with the process were not inclusive, conducted across the country, nor organized according to a predictable schedule, resembling window dressing instead of a commitment to take action.

At 3 p.m., the Council will continue its interactive dialogue with the Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples. It will then continue the general debate on human rights situations that require the Council's attention. Interactive Dialogue with the Advisory Committee Presentation of Reports LAZHARI BOUZID,Chairperson of the Advisory Committee, presenting the Advisory Committee's annual report, explained that since the twenty-fifth session of the Committee, initially scheduled for August this year, was postponed to February 2021 owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, the current annual report covered only the Committee’s twenty-fourth session. Before the Council, along with the report of the Advisory Committee on its twenty-fourth session, there were two thematic reports. The first thematic report dealt with national policies and human rights. While noting that some progress had been made towards realizing the Sustainable Development Goals, it referred to existing challenges and obstacles, such as lack of funding and sufficiently qualified personnel. The second thematic report concerned the importance of a legally binding instrument on the right to development. It concluded that such an instrument would create an enabling environment for development and more favourable conditions for all human rights. Discussion Speakers questioned the value of a legally binding instrument on the right to development, noting that it would be of little use if all parties did not agree on its underlying premises and therefore were unlikely to adhere to its terms. Speakers reaffirmed that States should integrate into their national policies a human rights perspective, and highlighted the need for reliable and disaggregated data. Terrorism and extremism trampled human rights, and it was the responsibility of the international community to address this scourge. Speakers expressed concerns about the idea of racial superiority gaining currency. Additional resources should be made available to the Advisory Committee so it may fulfill its mandate ; it was important that the Advisory Committee finalize its report on terrorism and submit it as soon as possible. Welcoming the compendium of best practices related to the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals, speakers spotlighted the efforts to ensure gender equality within the human rights mechanisms. The significance of international cooperation to ensure the realization of the right to development was even greater in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Speakers said that in realizing the right to development, politicization should be avoided and the specific contexts of countries should be considered, including their religious, cultural, social and historical characteristics. Concluding Remarks LAZHARI BOUZID,Chairperson of the Advisory Committee, called on the Council to entrust the Advisory Committee with new mandates and noted that it had submitted proposals in that regard. Oral Update by the High Commissioner on the Situation of Human Rights in Venezuela MICHELLE BACHELET, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, recalling that she had acknowledged the recent adoption of positive measures by the Government of Venezuela, such as the pardoning of 110 persons, the release of 40 persons, and greater cooperation with her Office, said that her Office continued to document cases of repression of peaceful protests in the context of the state of alarm in force since March, including the arrests of demonstrators protesting low wages and pensions, poor public services, and gasoline shortages. In addition, it had observed restrictions on freedom of expression. Acknowledging the efforts of the authorities towards the Venezuelan migrants returning to the country, she expressed concerns about the stigmatizing discourse of some officials who held those who returned through irregular crossings responsible for introducing COVID-19 in Venezuela. The pandemic had compounded other pre-existing emergencies, such as the food crisis. Imposing additional sanctions on diesel exports may further exacerbate the already critical gasoline shortage and hamper the distribution of humanitarian aid and essential goods. She reiterated her call to lift economic sanctions to facilitate the allocation of resources during the pandemic. Statement by Concerned Country Venezuela, speaking as a concerned country, firmly rejected imposing resolutions against sovereign countries in this Council, especially when said resolutions did not receive the support of the State concerned. The protection and promotion of human rights should be based on genuine cooperation and dialogue. The work of the Council in that regard should be geared towards universality, objectivity and non-selectivity, and should seek to eradicate any pollicization and double standards. Venezuela took note of the concerns expressed by the High Commissioner and would respond to them in due course. Her oral update was, however, marked by methodological shortcomings and included biased information which fuelled the media campaign waged against Venezuela. The Government nevertheless remained open for a constructive exchange of information with the High Commissioner and her Office. There was an ongoing multifaceted aggression against Venezuela, spearheaded by the United States, which included the imposition of unilateral coercive measures. General Debate on Human Rights Situations that Require the Council’s Attention Speakers expressed concerns about the destruction of mosques, and attacks against women for wearing the hijab, amongst other instances of Islamophobia. The practice of naming and shaming sometimes served as a means of meddling in the internal affairs of States, in violation of the United Nations Charter. Touting the value of the Universal Periodic Review, speakers encouraged the Council to pay particular attention to issues such as poverty, development, marginalization, and the digital divide, which could not be divorced from any meaningful discussion on human rights. The Council should play a key role in preventing indoctrination of the most vulnerable segments of the population and countering the spread of terrorist ideologies. Some speakers called for the immediate release of all human rights defenders that had been arbitrarily detained. Other speakers called for the creation of a Special Procedure mandate on climate change and human rights to ensure a long-term focus on climate change in the Council, notably in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Speakers also flagged human rights violations in, or involving, the following countries or regions : Iran, Venezuela, Belarus, Russian Federation, temporarily occupied Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol, China, Syria, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Myanmar, United States, Hong Kong, Tibet, South Sudan, Nicaragua, India, Jammu and Kashmir, Russian occupied Georgia’s Abkhazia and Tkshinvali regions, Israel, State of Palestine, Lebanon, Xinjiang, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Burundi, Sudan, Turkey, Armenia, Philippines, Djibouti, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Azerbaijan, Côte d’Ivoire, Zimbabwe, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bahrain, Cameroon, Yemen and Nepal.

Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.Find sources: ""Atomic Industrial Forum"" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR (January 2017) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The Atomic Industrial Forum (AIF) was an industrial policy organization for the commercial development of nuclear power and energy. Contents 1 History 1.1 1950s 1.2 1960s 1.3 1980s 1.4 2000s 2 References History[edit] 1950s[edit] The Atomic Industrial Forum history dates to Autumn 1952, when it was being first organized: I would propose that those industrial concerns, institutions and individuals that are today actively engaged in atomic energy research, development and operations form—voluntarily and without governmental urging or subsidy—a national association of atomic industries.— T. Keith Glennan, President of the Case Institute of Technology and founding member, AIF Board of Directors, November 1952 In response, some 30 industrialists, engineers, and educators met in January 1953 to establish the forum.[1] The AIF was formally incorporated on April 10, 1953, in New York City, and marked the beginning of the commercial nuclear power industry in the United StatesThe first Executive Director of AIF was Charles Robbins. As a profit trade association the AIF advocated the peaceful uses of atomic energy and increasing the role of the private sector in its development. Its first order of business was to advocate revising the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 to allow and foster the commercial ownership of non weapons nuclear facilities, such as production of radioactive isotopes and nuclear power plants. AIF established strong working relationships with the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission and the Congressional Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. AIF's efforts helped to achieve the passage of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 which resulted in the growth of a commercial nuclear industry. AIF was organized on the basis of an executive committee, the annual election of officers and a permanent operations staff, headed by an Executive Director, Mr. Charles Robbins. 1960s[edit] In 1963 AIF established an international public information program. Working with other forums around the world, the program sought, through publications, workshops, exhibitions, speeches and outreach, to foster and achieve better understanding of the peaceful uses of atomic energy. Its first program director was Charles B.Yulish. Both the government and private sectors involvement in atomic energy grew steadily; eventually, more that 125 commercial nuclear power plants provided 20 percent of America's electricity. At the same time there were increasing debates on safeguards and regulation. The Atomic Energy Commission, which both promoted, developed and regulated nuclear development, was split into two agencies—the Energy Research and Development Agency, now the Department of Energy, and the independent U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Administration. As new challenges and opportunities evolved, new industry efforts and resources were required to address these matters. 1980s[edit] In 1987 the AIF was reconfigured into the Nuclear Utility Management and Resources Council (NUMARC), which addressed generic regulatory and technical issues, and the U.S. Council for Energy Awareness (USCEA), founded in 1979. In 1994 these two organizations were again reorganized and re-purposed. The Nuclear Energy Institute and the American Nuclear Energy Council (ANEC conducted public affairs, and the nuclear division of the Edison Electric Institute (EEI), was responsible for issues involving nuclear fuel supply and management, and the economics of nuclear energy. 2000s[edit] In 2011, the Nuclear Energy Institute became the leading organization representing the nuclear industry. NEI headquarters is in Washington, DC. References[edit] ^ ""History"". Nuclear Energy Institute. Retrieved 2015-04-15.

The organizational score represents the degree to which the organization influencing climate policy and legislation. Corporations also have relationship scores reflecting their links with influencers like trade associations. Both are combined to place the corporation in a performance band. Full details can be found here. close C Performance Band 61% Organisation Score 7% Engagement Intensity Engagement Intensity The engagement intensity (EI) is a metric of the extent to which the company is engaging on climate change policy matters, whether positively or negatively. It is a number from 0 (no engagement at all) to 100 (full engagement on all queries/data points). Clearly energy companies are more affected by climate regulations and will have a higher EI than, for example retailers. So an organization’s score should be looked at in conjunction with this metric to gauge the amount of evidence we are using in each case as a basis for scoring. On our scale, an EI of more than 35 indicates a relatively large amount of climate policy engagement. close Modifications to InfluenceMap Scoring Relationship Score, December 2020 A new batch of industry associations has been uploaded onto the InfluenceMap system and the relationship scores recalculated accordingly. Updated terminology, February 2021 We adjusted the terminology used to describe the queries running down the left-hand side of our scoring matrix and added additional explanatory text to the info-boxes. This has no impact on the scores and methodology. It has been done following user feedback to improve clarity. close Sector: Energy Head​quarters: Tokyo, Japan Official Web Site: https://www.jaif.or.jp/en/ Wikipedia: Japan Atomic Industrial Forum Summary of InfluenceMap Scoring Japan Atomic Industrial Forum (JAIF) strongly supports nuclear energy together with other energy sources including fossil fuels, stated as part of their position statement in 2018 on Paris agreement and Japan's CO2 reduction commitment. JAIF also appears to support renewables to play a role in the energy mix, however, does not appear to indicate a clear timeframe to increase its proportion. In his speech at the 2019 company conference, the chairman of JAIF expressed support for the transition of the energy mix with policy focus on nuclear but not renewables. Details of Organization Score What do the 0,1,2 and NSs, NAs mean? Each cell in the organization's matrix presents a chance for us to assess each data source against our column of climate change policy queries. We score from -2 to 2, with negative scores representing evidence of obstructive influence. ""NA"" means ""not applicable"" and ""NS"" means ""not scored"" - that is we did not find any evidence either way. In both cases, the cell's weighting is re-distributed over others. Red and blue cells represent highly interesting negative or positive influence respectively. Full details can be found here. close QUERIES DATA SOURCES Main Web Site The main organizational Web site of the company and its direct links to major affiliates and attached documents.

(Kansai EP) announced its plans for restarting its Takahama-1 and -2 (PWRs, 826 MWe each) and Mihama-3 (PWR, 826 MWe) Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs). It marks the first time in Japan that commercial reactors will have been restarted after obtaining permission to operate for sixty years. 26 April, 2021 Toward Achieving 46% Reduction in GHG Emissions by 2030 On April 22, at Japan’s Global Warming Prevention Headquarters, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga announced a new goal of cutting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 46 percent by 2030 from 2013 levels, adding that the nation would continue to endeavor toward a 50-percent cut. On the same day, the prime minister publicly committed Japan to that goal at the Leaders Summit on Climate, convened by President Joe Biden of the United States. 16 April, 2021 Decision on Disposal of ALPS Treated Water Stored at the Fukushima Daiichi NPPs On April 13, the Japanese government’s Inter-Ministerial Council for Contaminated Water and Decommissioning Issues decided, as a basic policy, that contaminated water accumulated at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plants of the Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO) would be released into the sea, having been treated by the multi-nuclide removal equipment known as the Advanced Liquid Processing System (ALPS). NEW24 August, 2021 Kenta Nagai METI and IAEA Agree on Further Review Missions to Fukushima Daiichi Visiting Vienna for three days from August 18 to 20, Minister Hiroshi Kajiyama of Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) met with Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on August 19. The two officials, in accordance with Japan’s requests, agreed to move forward with review missions toward the decommissioning of the Fukushima Daiichi and on the safety of ALPS (Advanced Liquid Processing System) in the treatment of water through the removal of radioactive contaminants. So far, Japan has accepted four review missions by IAEA’s specialists on the decommissioning at Fukushima Daiichi in general, treating them as international peer reviews of the progress of efforts by the government and the Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO), under the “mid-to-long-term roadmap” toward decommissioning. The last mission, which visited Japan in November 2018, provided important acknowledgments of progress in 17 areas, and offered 21 advisory points.

The reactor is located in Oarai Town, Ibaraki Prefecture, about a 90-minute drive northeast of Tokyo. The operation of the reactor had been suspended since the beginning of 2011 after its 13th cycle was completed. Since then, JAEA had been endeavoring to meet new regulatory standards for the reactor in the wake of the March 2011 earthquake. In November 2014, JAEA filed an application with the Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) for a compatibility examination of HTTR, following a similar application for its Japan Research Reactor No. 3 (JRR-3) in September. In June 2020, JAEA was given permission (basic design approval) to make changes to the HTTR installation, after which it undertook work on safety measures. The inspections necessary for restarting the reactor were finally completed In July 2021, and various other inspections will now be successively carried out to confirm the reac...more 2 August, 2021 Kenta Nagai Information about Fukushima Daiichi NPS Water Treatment ■The Japanese Government’s Announcement of the Basic Policy on handling of the ALPS treated water at TEPCO’s Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station (FDNPS) -- Based on more than six years of comprehensive study by experts, reviews by the IAEA, and engagement with parties concerned, the Government of Japan published the Basic Policy on handling of the ALPS (Advanced Liquid Processing System) treated water at FDNPS on 13 April 2021. --Reference: https://www.meti.go.jp/english/earthquake/nuclear/decommissioning/pdf/pr_bpalps.pdf <Update contents> - The amount of ALPS treated water based on the latest data from TEPCO. - Information about Fukushima Daiichi NPS Water Treatment (Korean) - Information about Fukushima Daiichi NPS Water Treatment (Simplified Chinese) - Information about Fukushima Daiichi NPS Water Treatment (Traditional Chinese) Latest progress of Fukushima Daiichi NPP water treatment -- Amount of tr...more 28 July, 2021 Kenta Nagai METI’s Committee Shows Rough Draft of Next Strategic Energy Plan On July 21, a rough draft of Japan’s next Strategic Energy Plan was presented at the Strategic Policy Committee, under the Advisory Committee for Natural Resources and Energy. Because 3 years have passed since the current plan was issued, the Japanese government has been addressing its revision since last fall. The policy committee is chaired by Takashi Shiraishi, chancellor of the Prefectural University of Kumamoto. At the start of the meeting, Minister Hiroshi Kajiyama, head of Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said, “Given Japan’s goal of carbon neutrality by 2050, along with the new target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 46% from 2013 levels by the year 2030, efforts are very important in the energy field, in which greenhouse gas emissions account for more than 80% of total emissions.” He asked the policy committee to deepen its deliberations based on the draft. From the dual perspectives of responding to climate change and overcoming issues in Japan’s energy supply-and-demand structure, the draft of the new Strategic Energy Plan primarily focuses on three areas: The decade since the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi. Issues and actions toward realizing carbo...more 2 July, 2021 Kenta Nagai Mihama-3 Restarted After Decade-long Hiatus: First Restart in Japan of a Reactor Operating Beyond 40 Years On June 29, the Mihama-3 Nuclear Power Plant (PWR, 826MW) of the Kansai Electric Power Co. (Kansai EP) began to again generate power after a hiatus of slightly more than 10 years. Mihama-3 originally began commercial operation in December 1976. In May 2011, the unit entered a periodic inspection, when it underwent examinations by the Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) for compatibility with the new regulatory standards and for permission to extend its operating lifetime to up to 60 years. The unit was restarted on June 23, 2021, becoming the first in Japan to be restarted after operating for more than 40 years. A period of adjustment operations is now underway before the final stage of the periodic inspection, i.e., connection to the grid. After a final inspection by the NRA, Mihama-3 is expected to resume commercial service on July 27. In addition to work on safety measures based on the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi, Kansai EP carried out other kinds of w...more 28 June, 2021 Kenta Nagai Mihama-3 Restarts after Decade-long Hiatus At 10:00 a.m. on June 23, the Kansai Electric Power Co. (Kansai EP) restarted its Mihama-3 Nuclear Power Plant (PWR, 826MW). The unit had entered a periodic inspection in May 2011, slightly more than decade ago. In the wake of the giant earthquake of March 2011 (officially named the Great East Japan Earthquake), the Japanese government passed legislation limiting NPPs to 40 years of operation in principle. Mihama-3 will be the first unit to be restarted since then that had served for more than 40 years. Its restart will be the first step toward the long-term utilization of NPPs whose safety has been confirmed. During the decade-long operational hiatus of the reactor, the central control room at Mihama-3 was digitalized as part of work to enhance safety measures. Persons on duty for the restart have trained on a simulator for about two years. Operation of Mihama-3 during its restart went smoothly this time. The unit went critical before dawn on June 24, achieving sustained fission, and begin ...more 25 June, 2021 Kaoru Ohno New Canada-Japan Partnership Supports Greater Collaboration to Meet Climate Change Objectives and Net-zero Goals Canadian Nuclear Association and Japan Atomic Industrial Forum sign Memorandum of Understanding Ottawa/Tokyo (June 24, 2021) - The Canadian Nuclear Association (CNA) and the Japan Atomic Industrial Forum (JAIF) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to carry out cooperative nuclear power and climate change activities. “We are happy to formalize this important partnership with JAIF,” said John Gorman, President and CEO of the CNA. “This presents both of our organizations with a great opportunity for collaborating and exchanging information to meet our common goals that include addressing the climate crisis. Nuclear technologies will play an important role here and partnerships like these align our collective efforts.” ”We are pleased with this fantastic opportunity to officially start a new partnership with the CNA through the MOU signing”, said Shiro Arai...more 24 June, 2021 Kenta Nagai METI Issues New Green Growth Strategy Through Achieving Carbon Neutrality On June 18, Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) issued a new version of the Green Growth Strategy through achieving Carbon Neutrality by 2050. In December 2020, the original strategy had been formulated in cooperation with relevant ministries and agencies as an industrial policy aimed at a “virtuous cycle of economy and the environment.” The new strategy, in addition to the benefits of decarbonization, looks at measures and responses benefiting people’s lives. It is supported by an Action Plan for the Growth Strategy, approved at a cabinet meeting held the same day. The new Green Growth Strategy restated the action plans that had appeared earlier for 14 key areas and industries, as follows: Offshore wind power, solar power, geothermal power Hydrogen, fuel ammonia Next-generation thermal energy Nuclear power Automobiles and storage batteries Semiconductors and information technology Marine vessels Physical distribution, flows of people, and civil engineering infrastructure Foods, agriculture, forestry and fisheries Aircraft Carbon recycling, materials Housing, structures, and next-ge...more 16 June, 2021 Kenta Nagai ANRE Sticks to “S+3E” Heated arguments over the core of Japan’s energy policy continue between a task force thoroughly examining regulations on renewable energies, etc., headed by Taro Kono, MInister for Administrative Reform and Regulatory Reform, on one side, and the Agency for Natural Resources and Energy (ANRE), under the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), on the other. The task force insists that ANRE clearly state “the principle of placing top priority on renewable energies” in the next Strategic Energy Plan. ANRE, in turn, insists that the principle of energy policy is “S+3E” (the conventional three E’s of energy security, economic efficiency and environmental protection, plus safety), by which safety, supply stability, environmental compatibility and economic efficiency are pursued simultaneously. The task force has been successful in getting five ministries and the Cabinet Secretariat to present their views on directions for measures to increase the use of renewable energies. It has asked ANRE to include the following three points on renewable energies in the Strategic Energy Plan: Placing top priority on renewable energies. Reforming the ...more 16 June, 2021 Kenta Nagai Japanese Cabinet Approves Environmental White Paper 2021 On June 8, the Cabinet approved the “Annual Report on the Environment, the Sound Material-Cycle Society and Biodiversity in Japan,” which is conventionally called the Environmental White Paper 2021. The white paper addresses three shifts implemented in measures by Japan’s Ministry of the Environment (MOE) in 2020, in accordance with its theme of redesigning the economy and society toward carbon neutrality by 2050. The three shifts are to a low-carbon society, to environmental economics, and to a decentralized society. At a press conference after the Cabinet meeting the same day, MOE Minister Shinjiro Koizumi said, “Younger people in particular, who cannot escape a time when climate change will become increasingly serious, are encouraged to read the white paper.” He said he looked to hearing from such people, particularly, their views and even proposals on the policy challenges ahead.

The two officials, in accordance with Japan’s requests, agreed to move forward with review missions toward the decommissioning of the Fukushima Daiichi and on the safety of ALPS (Advanced Liquid Processing System) in the treatment of water through the removal of radioactive contaminants. So far, Japan has accepted four review missions by IAEA’s specialists on the decommissioning at Fukushima Daiichi in general, treating them as international peer reviews of the progress of efforts by the government and the Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO), under the “mid-to-long-term roadmap” toward decommissioning. The last mission, which visited Japan in November 2018, provided important acknowledgments of progress in 17 areas, and offered 21 advisory points.

The reactor is located in Oarai Town, Ibaraki Prefecture, about a 90-minute drive northeast of Tokyo. The operation of the reactor had been suspended since the beginning of 2011 after its 13th cycle was completed. Since then, JAEA had been endeavoring to meet new regulatory standards for the reactor in the wake of the March 2011 earthquake.

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.Find sources: ""Atomic Industrial Forum"" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR (January 2017) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The Atomic Industrial Forum (AIF) was an industrial policy organization for the commercial development of nuclear power and energy. Contents 1 History 1.1 1950s 1.2 1960s 1.3 1980s 1.4 2000s 2 References History[edit] 1950s[edit] The Atomic Industrial Forum history dates to Autumn 1952, when it was being first organized: I would propose that those industrial concerns, institutions and individuals that are today actively engaged in atomic energy research, development and operations form—voluntarily and without governmental urging or subsidy—a national association of atomic industries.— T. Keith Glennan, President of the Case Institute of Technology and founding member, AIF Board of Directors, November 1952 In response, some 30 industrialists, engineers, and educators met in January 1953 to establish the forum.[1] The AIF was formally incorporated on April 10, 1953, in New York City, and marked the beginning of the commercial nuclear power industry in the United StatesThe first Executive Director of AIF was Charles Robbins. As a profit trade association the AIF advocated the peaceful uses of atomic energy and increasing the role of the private sector in its development. Its first order of business was to advocate revising the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 to allow and foster the commercial ownership of non weapons nuclear facilities, such as production of radioactive isotopes and nuclear power plants. AIF established strong working relationships with the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission and the Congressional Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. AIF's efforts helped to achieve the passage of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 which resulted in the growth of a commercial nuclear industry. AIF was organized on the basis of an executive committee, the annual election of officers and a permanent operations staff, headed by an Executive Director, Mr. Charles Robbins. 1960s[edit] In 1963 AIF established an international public information program. Working with other forums around the world, the program sought, through publications, workshops, exhibitions, speeches and outreach, to foster and achieve better understanding of the peaceful uses of atomic energy. Its first program director was Charles B.Yulish. Both the government and private sectors involvement in atomic energy grew steadily; eventually, more that 125 commercial nuclear power plants provided 20 percent of America's electricity. At the same time there were increasing debates on safeguards and regulation. The Atomic Energy Commission, which both promoted, developed and regulated nuclear development, was split into two agencies—the Energy Research and Development Agency, now the Department of Energy, and the independent U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Administration. As new challenges and opportunities evolved, new industry efforts and resources were required to address these matters. 1980s[edit] In 1987 the AIF was reconfigured into the Nuclear Utility Management and Resources Council (NUMARC), which addressed generic regulatory and technical issues, and the U.S. Council for Energy Awareness (USCEA), founded in 1979. In 1994 these two organizations were again reorganized and re-purposed. The Nuclear Energy Institute and the American Nuclear Energy Council (ANEC conducted public affairs, and the nuclear division of the Edison Electric Institute (EEI), was responsible for issues involving nuclear fuel supply and management, and the economics of nuclear energy. 2000s[edit] In 2011, the Nuclear Energy Institute became the leading organization representing the nuclear industry. NEI headquarters is in Washington, DC. References[edit] ^ ""History"". Nuclear Energy Institute. Retrieved 2015-04-15.

It was founded in April 1967 and serves as a platform for the automakers of Japan to share technological developments and management practices. There are currently 14 member companies, manufacturing not only cars, but trucks and motorcycles as well. The organization also deals with the manufacturing and distribution of vehicle parts around the world. Together, the companies of JAMA hold a vast share of the markets in the United States, Europe, and many developing countries. JAMA also has offices located in Beijing, Singapore, Washington, D.C. (US Office), Toronto (Canadian Office) and Brussels, Belgium (Europe Office).

Other than limited sales of the Infiniti Q45 these brands were only available outside Japan until 2005, when Lexus was introduced to the Japanese domestic market (""JDM""). Acura and Infiniti are also planned to be introduced into the Japanese domestic market by 2008. Toyota also began marketing some of its small domestic market cars in the United States under the Scion marque in 2003. In Japan, there are also numerous small car manufacturers, coachbuilders, and tuning companies. Companies such as Mitsuoka, Spoon Sports, and HKS build production vehicles, sports cars, or one-off concepts in much smaller quantities than the major carmakers, therefore they are not included in JAMA.

This initial interest has been continued and later on developed into something more concrete. I participated in the Earth Summit of 1992 as a member of a NGO group. I sympathize with the objectives of JACSES and became its member. At first I supported the management and activities, and thereafter I went on to attain an important role in JACSES. Background/Career and Activities outside JACSESF Born in Tokyo in the year 1950. Graduated from the Biology Section of Department of Science, Osaka University. Completed an Agricultural Research Course (Agriculture and Forestry Economics) in Graduate School of Kyoto University, and received my Doctorate in Agricultural Science. Currently working as a Professor in the Department of Economics (Faculty of Socio-economic Networking), Kokugakuin University. Executive board members of Japan NGO Center for International Cooperation (JANIC), and of the Policy Research Institute for the Civil Sector (PRICS). Conducting a research regarding sustainable development and socioeconomic changes related to the problems of global environment and also the problems due to the changing lifestyles. Specifically researching the following: the environmental capacity (the environmental resource use capacity: eco-space); the sustainable production consumption pattern; the worldfs agricultural food problem and globalization; organic farming for environmental preservation; the ecological movement; the cooperative society movement, the NGO - NPO theory etc. My Message /ThoughtsF I believe not in overworking or straining oneself, but advancing ahead by taking one step back and then moving two steps forward. Link to related web site: @Furusawa Zeminar Site @http://kuin.jp/fur/kaleidoss.htm Jiro ADACHI Executive Director Program Coordinator: Green Tax Reform Program . Activities at JACSESF Linke to ""Green Tax Reform Program"" I am responsible for managing the daily activities of JACSES. I am also the Program Coordinator for the Green Tax Reform Program Background/Career and Activities outside JACSESF As a university student, I worked on NGO activities such as ODA reform, advocacy and publication to strengthen the environmental measures for companies. After working for the Toray Corporation in their Sales Department and Personnel Department, joined JACSES in 1995. Currently, I am also a lecturer at the Yokohama National University (Sustainable Development Workshop), a member of the Japan Quality Assurance Organization (JQA) CDM Advisory Committee, Coordinator of the Carbon Tax Study Group, a member of the Kiko Network steering committee. My Message /ThoughtsF Green Tax Reform needs to be pushed forward, for example, to introduce green tax and eliminate environmentally harmful subsidies. There are lots of other issues that have hardly been touched and urgently need to be reformed in order to realize our dream of a fair and sustainable society. Itfs still a long road ahead and we just need to tackle all these issues one by one without giving up at any point of time. Yuki TANABE Program Coordinator: Sustainable Development and Aid Program (SDAP) . Activities at JACSESF Negative environmental and social impacts have been arising from development activities funded by finance institutions, while Japanese contributions to international financial institutions have made Japan the second-largest vote shareholder in the World Bank, and the largest in the Asian Development Bank (ADB), moreover Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) is now the largest bilateral development agency in the World. My works are 1) to reform policies and guidelines to ensure that social and environmental factors are fully taken into account in the decision making of finance institutions, and protect the rights and choices of people most affected by development projects, 2) to avoid/minimize socially and environmentally negative impacts caused by huge development projects, and facilitate incorporation of the interests of people affected by development projects into institutional practices, 3) to strengthen the role of civil society in the reform of finance institutions through policy dialogues with key decision-makers, and 4) to enhance the capabilities and collective leverage of local groups and NGOs to monitor development activities. Background/Career and Activities outside JACSESF I joined JACSES in February 2003, and became a Program Coordinator of Sustainable Development and Aid Program in February 2005. I have been a member of the International Committee of the NGO Forum on ADB since 2004. In the past, I worked for A SEED JAPAN as Director of its Corporate Accountability Program (2001-2002). I have also worked in the Climate Change Program in WWF-Japan (2001-2002). | HOME | Japan Center for a Sustainable Environment and Society (JACSES) 401, Sanshin Bldg., 2-3-2 Iidabashi, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo 102-0072 Japan (MAP) Phone: +81-3-3556-7323 Fax: +81-3-3556-7328@Email: Copyright JACSES All Rights Reserved.",Japan Center for a Sustainable Environment and Society

121,"Outline｜About JERI｜The Japan Economic Research Institute Home Personal information protection Site Policy About JERI Outline Location Supporting member system About JERI The Japan Economic Research Institute (JERI) was established in 1946, during the chaotic postwar period when Japan’s future was still uncertain. The founder and first chairman of the board of directors, Kamekichi Takahashi, was an out-of-power but up-and-coming economist. Tired of watching the government do little more than carry out the orders issued by the Supreme Commander of Allied Powers, Takahashi was motivated to study the fundamental questions that concerned the Japanese economy rather than focusing on the nation’s immediate problems. He determined that the only solution was for private volunteers to step in and deal with the situation and, thus, decided to found Japan Economic Research Institute. However, discovering the essence of what drives economic development is not an easy task, and many debates over the “growth” controversy (1958–), theories involving the “turning-point and stable growth” theory (1965), and “growth deceleration” (1970) resulted. Among the thinkers was an economist named Osamu Shimomura, father of the high economic growth theory, who took up Takahashi's mantle and consistently stood in the forefront as an opinion leader in these debates and, later, in 1984, became chairman of JERI, where he led the organizationnization, until then mainly funded by the Japan Previously funded mainly by Japan Development Bank (predecessor of Development Bank of Japan Inc.), JERI had reorganized in 1981, adding new financial backers and expanding its network of support to include other institutions in not only government (both national and local) but also other sectors such as education and industry. Accordingly, the organization expanded the scope of its activities from economics to include regional development, PFI/PPP, environment, energy, medicine, welfare and other areas both domestically and overseas. Responding to the changing business climate resulting from the 2009 governmental reform of laws governing charitable corporations, in December 2010 JERI became two entities: The Japan Economic Research Institute (hereinafter “JERI”), a general incorporated foundation (GIF), and Japan Economic Research Institute Inc. (hereinafter “JERI Inc.”), dedicated to activities related to commissioned studies. This bifurcation facilitated JERI’s deeper and broader research and dissemination of information, often in conjunction with the Research Center for Regional Future, which it established to actively study and find solutions to local and regional problems. JERI has inherited its predecessor’s research spirit. For us, as our motto declares that “continued analysis of current conditions and insight into the essence of economic dynamism” are two critical issues. We will continue to maintain this attitude, aiming to be an “excellent research institute”and a “pilot think tank that always takes the extra half step” ,as our motto. And then, we strive to contribute to the creation of a better society. Outline Established July 17, 1946 (became a general incorporated foundation: December 1, 2010) Purpose to contribute to the arts and sciences, as well as the welfare and development of our economic society, while studying and researching important economic problems affecting Japan and other countries Funding Development Bank of Japan Inc.

Originally published in Japanese as Ajia Kankyo Hakusho 2006/2007, this English-translated edition serves as an indispensible source of information on the Asian environment and offers pertinent commentaries on such wide-ranging issues as public health, water supply, sanitation, wildlife trade, renewable energy, CDM projects, and environmental laws and treaties. Four important messages emerge from this volume, namely that environmental problems are expected to become more serious as Asian economies continue their rapid growth, the root cause of such problems is the present pattern of economic development and resource use, climate change presents both a crisis and an opportunity for the region, and intraregional and subregional cooperation in Asia must be greatly enhanced. Despite the breadth of topics covered and the vastly different socioeconomic and environmental conditions found throughout Asia, this book offers a broad yet sufficiently detailed overview of the environment in Asia. Like its predecessors in the series, The State of the Environment in Asia 2006/2007 succeeds in bringing greater clarity to the region’s environmental situation and offers practical steps for thinking locally and acting regionally in global partnership for sustainable development. “The uniqueness of this volume lies in its vast collection of contributors from across Asia, including academics, independent experts and environmental NGOs. From this base, strong emphasis is given to information gathering and data collection by way of field visits and direct contact with local peoples concerned.” —Hisakazu Kato, Professor Emeritus, Graduate School of Law, Nagoya University Japan Environmental Council (JEC), founded in 1979, conducts research, holds conferences, and makes policy recommendations on the subject of the environment. JEC was awarded the “Environment for Tomorrow Prize 2005” by the Asahi Shimbun.

128,"Energy and Environment Council (The Prime Minister in Action) | Prime Minister of Japan and His Cabinet Home > News > The Prime Minister in Action > September 2012 > Energy and Environment Council Energy and Environment Council Friday, September 14, 2012 Tweet Photograph of the Prime Minister delivering an address at the meeting of the Energy and Environment Council 1 Photograph of the Prime Minister delivering an address at the meeting of the Energy and Environment Council 2 Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda attended the meeting of the Energy and Environment Council at the Prime Minister's Office. At the meeting, the Innovative Strategy for Energy and the Environment was decided. Based on the decision, the Prime Minister said, ""By deciding the Innovative Strategy for Energy and the Environment here today, we are now finally able to stand at the new starting line. Reviewing the history of nuclear power generation in Japan over the past half century, there had been various efforts, trial and error, and above all, cooperation from the municipalities in which the nuclear power plants were located with the national policy. Even though, we still have difficult problems that remain unsolved today, including the issue of the final disposal site. Further, as we have decided to aim for realizing a society that does not depend on nuclear power after having experienced the accident on March 11 last year, we now face numerous problems that are even more difficult to solve. We must also respond properly to international requests, including nuclear non-proliferation. What we are about to start is this type of extremely difficult challenge. However, no matter how difficult it may be, we must no longer put off dealing with it. Naturally, answers to the problems that have not been solved up till now cannot be found immediately. In order to change the entire system surrounding the nuclear power stations in this country that has been established over a history spanning half a century, it will be necessary to sincerely interact with the various parties involved over a considerably long period. In addition, it is impossible to get a decisive view of all the future potential developments concerning matters such as the international energy situation that may have a large influence on the energy structure at this stage. I believe that it is rather irresponsible to make a decisive judgment on the unforeseeable future. We must start with a strategy that has both a secure direction and the flexibility to cope with changes in the situation, without wavering from the basic policy and also not excessively restricting future decisions. At the same time, there is another important issue. Human resources with advanced technical skills and a strong sense of pride will become more and more important for restoring the accident site in Fukushima and implementing the decontamination at the earliest date possible, for ensuring the safety of the existent nuclear power stations, for steadily carrying forward the decommissioning, and also for solving the problem of the final disposal site. We must overcome the damage of the accident and secure human resources and technology as a matter of national responsibility. Energy is extremely important for people's lives and economic activities. The new 'energy society' for which the new strategy aims is a decentralized-network type society which can be realized only with the participation of each citizen. The Energy and Environment Council called for overcoming the confrontation between the opposition to nuclear power generation and its promotion in the meeting held in July 29, 2011. Now we must exercise wisdom and share burdens and the government and the people must work together to establish a new society in terms of energy. This is the new starting line. Thinking of the people of Fukushima who are still deprived of their homeland, and without neglecting the repeated discussions with local governments in which nuclear power plants are located, such as Aomori Prefecture, as well as with relevant countries abroad, we must now unravel the tangled web strand by strand. In order to serve as a precedent to the world and to fulfill our responsibility for future generations, working together with the people, I would like to start one by one from what we can do. The members of the Energy and Environment Council including myself, who decided the new strategy here today, must lead the change, and I would like to ask for your cooperation.""

Japan's Changing Environmental Policy, Government Initiatives, and Industry Responses SUKEHIRO GOTOH The year 1989 was a turning point in Japan's environmental policy. The concept of sustainable development from Our Common Future (World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987) had taken hold, public concern about global environmental problems was growing, and global environmental issues were on the agenda at the July G7 Economic Summit meeting in Paris. In May 1989, the Japanese government established a Council of Ministers for Global Environmental Conservation. At its first meeting, the council set forth six directives for global environmental conservation (Japan Environment Agency, 1990): Participate positively in formulating an international framework for protecting the global environment and promote measures from a global viewpoint. Promote the observation (monitoring) and research of the global environment to expedite the formulation of global environmental protection, measured on the basis of scientific understanding of the effects of human activities on the global environment Pursue the development and transfer of technology for global environmental protection by contributing to various international efforts Make efforts to expand official development assistance for environmental protection through the development and transfer of appropriate technology for developing countries and the training of human resources in the environmental sector Strengthen environmental consideration regarding the implementation of official development assistance Page 235 Share Cite Suggested Citation:""Japan's Changing Environmental Policy, Government Initiatives, and Industry Responses.""

Several reports were released by the Council on Industrial Structure and Policy of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI). In 1990, an interim report, Earth Revival Program, called for a new value concept intended to change people's lifestyles—a paradigm shift in innovative industrial technology and coordination of industrial activities and environmental policies. The new value concept placed less importance on material affluence and more on spiritual, cultural, and traditional aspects of life. The shift is not only from pollution control to prevention, but also to technologies of dematerialization—those which use less material and energy per unit product. In November 1990, the Experts' Study Committee on A Recycle-Oriented Society for Environmental Protection of the Japan Environment Agency (JEA), published a report that formed the basis for Japan's 1991 recycling law (Japanese Environment Agency, 1991). Industry also appears to have made big changes in its environmental policy since 1989. As early as April 1990, Keidanren (a federation of economic organizations representing more than 1,000 private industry and business organizations) released a document showing industry's approach to new environmental policy (Keidanren, 1990a). For the first time, Japanese companies were required to review all their activities and operations from the viewpoint of reducing their total environmental load and, in particular, integrating all environmental precautions and considerations into their operations. In November 1990, this was followed by another document that reviewed existing waste-management practices in major industries and proposed a new responsible upstream preventive approach (Keidanren, 1990b). This was extended in April 1991 with the consensus of the Keidanren member organization on guidelines for corporate environmental actions (Keidanren, 1991). The 24 guidelines cover 11 corporate environmental policy areas, including implementing internal environmental auditing and management, and improving environmental attributes of products (Appendix 1). Although the charter is not binding, almost all corporations, particularly leading firms, are making efforts to improve environmental performance in accordance with it. Concurrently, the government intensified its environmental public policy efforts. On the basis of JEA's 1991 recycle society report (JEA, 1991), six ministries, including MITI, the Ministry of Health and Welfare, and JEA, worked collaboratively with industry on a bill to promote recycling. The Law Promoting the Utilization of Recycled Resources, or the recycling law of 1991, stipulates new responsibilities for promoting recycling in selected industries, of first- and Page 236 Share Cite Suggested Citation:""Japan's Changing Environmental Policy, Government Initiatives, and Industry Responses.""

This responsibility includes voluntarily conducting product (life cycle) assessments for improving recyclability under the guidance of relevant government ministries. In October 1991, the government proposed the largest amendments in 20 years to the existing Waste Disposal and Public Cleansing Law. The amendments introduce waste reduction at source and separation, recycling, or both before waste generation (in Article 1, Purpose); require preliminary product assessment for proper disposability (in Article 3, Corporate Responsibility); and add corporate responsibility to recover certain waste designated by the Minister of Health and Welfare as ""indisposable in nature"" (in Article 6.3, Collaboration of Corporations). To promote this upstream approach in industry, in October 1992 MITI released a guideline, The Voluntary Plan, and in February 1993 JEA published a similar document, Action Program for Environmentally Conscious Cooperates. Both guidelines align with the Keidanren (1991) Global Environment Charter. The latest government environmental policy initiative is the Basic Environment Law (BEL) of November 1993. As early as in March 1993, after 15 months of formal consultation and discussion with industry, the Central Pollution Abatement Council, JEA's Nature Conservation Council, and several different government ministries and agencies, the government sent BEL to the 126th session of the Diet. The bill's passage into law was rocky: It was debated for 58 hours in the Lower and Upper Houses. It was due to be passed into law in June 1993, but the Lower House was dissolved suddenly in the midst of political turmoil, and the bill automatically became null. The same bill, however, was proposed to the 128th Session by the new administration and was passed on November 12, 1993. The new legislation, in principle, is an integrated national environmental policy act that incorporates the former Basic Pollution Control Law, the Nature Conservation Law, and the government's basic policy principles for global environmental conservation. In the context of industrial ecology, BEL includes consideration of environmental load in addition to kogai, or pollution; directions and goals of a future sustainable economic society, including extended corporate responsibilities; and government policies to promote and encourage corporate and other efforts to enhance environmental performance. Some articles of particular importance in this legislation are listed in Appendix 2. THE GOAL: A GLOBAL RECYCLE SOCIETY Many of these initiatives mirror the vision Glenn T. Seaborg, an American Nobel laureate in chemistry, had in 1974. He forecasted development of a steady state world in which resources are recycled and used with maximum efficiency. He said: ""We will be creating a 'recycle society' … in which virtually all materials used are reused indefinitely and virgin resources become primarily the 'make-up' materials.…"" (Seaborg, 1974). Having recognized all the constraints Page 237 Share Cite Suggested Citation:""Japan's Changing Environmental Policy, Government Initiatives, and Industry Responses.""

In fact, Towards a Recycle Society in the 21stCentury (JEA, 1991) conceptualized a simple model of the recycle society (Figure 1). In this society, well-designed technical and economic mechanisms encourage industry and the public to seize every opportunity to recover, recycle, and reuse materials and energy as much as is thermodynamically feasible. Simultaneous frugal use and environmentally preferable selection of materials and energy sources lower the overall environmental load resulting from human activities to ensure local, regional, and global sustainable development. In reality, however, the current economic growth of industrialized nations can hardly be characterized as environmentally sustainable. For example, the fiscal year (FY) 1990 material balance for Japan (Figure 2) shows that only 10 percent of the more than 2 billion metric tons of virgin natural resources used is recycled. The average Japanese consumes 46 times more natural resources than an Indonesian. Consumption of the world's commercial energy resources illustrates the point further. In 1990, industrialized nations, with about 22 percent of the world population, consumed about 82 percent of the world's commercial energy, which was 8.1 billion metric tons of oil equivalent (Tolba and El-Kholy, 1992). This means that, on average, a person living in a high-income country consumes 16.2 times more energy than a person living in a developing nation. From an industrial ecology perspective, the current industrialized society, popularly referred to as the ""throw-away"" or ""mass production, mass consumption, mass discard"" society in Japan, is indeed well characterized by linear flows Page 238 Share Cite Suggested Citation:""Japan's Changing Environmental Policy, Government Initiatives, and Industry Responses.""

To move to a sustainable society, overall environmental efficiency will have to be improved. To approach complete closure of materials cycles in society, present industrial ecosystems, which are readily identifiable in interrelated production processes, interacting industrial sectors, and interacting production, consumption, and waste-management systems need to be assessed to identify opportunities for enhancing and continually improving environmental efficiencies. THE POTENTIAL AND LIMITS OF USING LIFE CYCLE APPROACHES Industrial practices to minimize total environmental load and improve the environmental efficiency of industrial ecosystems occur in three areas: product design and makeup, process design and operation, and business management strategy. A variety of life cycle analyses and clean production (or environmental management) systems are used for product and process improvement strategies; environmental auditing and environmental performance evaluation are used to manage business strategies. In these endeavors, environmental life cycle methodologies play a key role. Nearly a dozen life cycle schemes and procedures have been proposed to date. Broadly, they may be classified into two approaches. The first, based on practical engineering experiences in industry, is known by such names as design for environment (Allenby, 1994), design for recyclability (Henstock, 1988), or simply ecodesign in different countries of Europe. This approach involves qualitative Page 239 Share Cite Suggested Citation:""Japan's Changing Environmental Policy, Government Initiatives, and Industry Responses.""

In Japan, this is generally known as product assessment. For example, manufacturers of electric appliances for the home are required, during early stages of planning and design, to perform a preliminary product assessment on materials use, product structure design, and recyclability when the product is retired, in accordance with MITI's guidelines (MITI Order No. 55, October 25, 1991). This assessment is stipulated in the Japanese recycling law regarding the designated ''products of the first kind."" Table 1 presents a simplified standard checklist for this purpose. Manufacturers will usually develop far more detailed evaluative checklists and scoring sheets. Several products that have been improved by these assessments are already on the market from leading companies such as Hitachi and Matsushita. The second approach, based on detailed material and energy balances or inventories taken at different stages of product life cycle, requires a quantitative analysis and evaluation of a product and its associated processes, or the product system. The terms life cycle inventory, life cycle analysis, and product life cycle assessment (PLCA) have been recently coined to denote this approach. The life cycle methodology is a powerful tool that can help manufacturers analyze and improve their products and directly associated processes. It is also intended to assist public policymakers in formulating environmental legislation and to enable consumers to make better-informed purchases. The type of information needed differs depending on whether it is used for internal (within company) or external (public) purposes. Internal decision-makers Page 241 Share Cite Suggested Citation:""Japan's Changing Environmental Policy, Government Initiatives, and Industry Responses."" National Academy of Engineering. 1997.

Some information may also be used by a company's top management in research and development decisions about new products or services and in gauging future business opportunities. Less-specific information may be used for public policy purposes, but for internal purposes the information has to be scientifically proven and comprehensive yet clear-cut and easily understandable. A general procedural scheme for conducting a rigorous PLCA is shown in Figure 4 (Gotoh, 1993). It is similar to the technical framework proposed by the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (1991, 1993). The scheme includes clear goal definition and scoping at the outset but emphasizes the dynamic and reiterative nature of life cycle assessment practices for continuous improvement of environmental attributes of products. Conducting a rigorous PLCA using this comprehensive scheme is a very detailed, time-consuming, and costly exercise. In principle, obtaining useful information for decision making is relatively uncomplicated if the boundary of the study is clearly defined, the methodology is strictly applied, and reliable, high-quality data are available. However, these are fairly large provisions that are usually not realized in many practices. In 1992, the Federation of Japan Consumers Cooperatives conducted an extensive PLCA of the packaging materials they use. The study involved doing a life cycle inventory (step 2) and impact analysis (step 3) for four beverage containers currently in use by the cooperatives. The study identified and calculated environmental loads associated with different life stages of the containers, including FIGURE 4 Basic procedural scheme for conducting a product life cycle assessment.

The information, however, has not been very useful for determining which container is environmentally superior. This is because the impact analysis (step 3) and integrated evaluation (step 4) involve value judgments that are necessarily subjective. One can hardly compare heavy energy use with less water effluent and reach one conclusion. It is like trying to compare apples and oranges. To overcome this kind of difficulty, SETAC currently recommends including a peer-review process to enhance the credibility as well as the scientific and technical quality of assessments (SETAC, 1993). The International Standardization Organization has serious efforts under way to develop an internationally acceptable and standardized methodology of rigorous PLCAs. However, this venture clearly bucks current trends that allow manufacturers maximum creativity and ingenuity and favor industry's diversified, voluntary life cycle practices as a way to improve the environmental attributes of products. Since 1985, well over 100 PLCAs have been carried out in Europe, North America, and Japan, most of them concerned with packaging materials, especially food and drink containers. This means that the application of the present rigorous methodology of PLCA has been limited to rather simple products of simple design. For durable products of sophisticated design such as a television set or an automobile, the methodology does not appear to be applicable because of the large amount of data required for every component involved, the extensive analysis required, and the many assumptions that have to be made. In addition, different results are possible from using the same methodology to compare two similar products. For example, two comparable PLCA studies applied to the same packaging material but that assumed different end-of-life disposal methods yielded results differing by several hundred percent (Pedersen, 1993). Recently, however, a new approach for evaluating environmental loading of complicated products has been emerging. Data from output tables are used for inventory analysis,(e.g., for an average automobile), and total life cycle environmental loading—materials and energy used in different but interrelated industrial sectors and consumption—is estimated and evaluated. Kondo et al.(1993) calculated total life cycle carbon dioxide emissions for an average-sized Japanese passenger car by analyzing 408 interacting industrial sectors of the Japanese 1985 input-output table. The approach still needs to be refined, but it is a promising tool for assessing the environmental loading of durable goods. RECYCLABILITY: A MEASURE FOR SUCCESS OF CORPORATE ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP? The human ecosystem, defined in Figure 3, constantly intersects with local, regional, and global natural ecosystems through interchange of materials and energy as natural resources and wastes. It is a complex and dynamic system with a large number of subsystems identifiable within numerous industrial ecosystems. Page 243 Share Cite Suggested Citation:""Japan's Changing Environmental Policy, Government Initiatives, and Industry Responses."" National Academy of Engineering. 1997. The Industrial Green Game: Implications for Environmental Design and Management. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/4982. × Save Cancel Natural biological ecosystems are complex. One of their important features is that abiotics, such as nutrients, circulate dynamically and are constantly recycled through producer, consumer, and decomposer organisms. The metabolic activities of ecosystems run on sun energy. In a sound natural ecosystem, therefore, everything has a use and there are no waste materials. Closing the material circle as a whole is necessary if the model of natural ecology is to be used to construct a mature sustainable industrial ecology and to transform the present throw-away society into a sustainable recycle society. Hence, from an industrial ecology perspective, recycling is important for improving the overall environmental performance of society. Strategically, to minimize loss, recycling should be promoted first in interrelated industrial processes (in-plant recycling) and among different industrial sectors (interindustry recycling) and then among interacting production, consumption, and waste management systems (postconsumer recycling). For nearly 2 decades, waste-exchange programs have been used in Japan to foster interindustry recycling in almost all prefectural governments, where the governor is responsible for formulating a local industrial waste-management plan. Recycling, by definition, is an economically viable activity that recovers, reprocesses, and reuses materials that are otherwise deemed waste. It principle, three types of recycling, encompassing both closed- and open-loop recycling, are possible (Figure 5) (Gotoh,1976). In open-loop recycling, a waste product is reclaimed, reprocessed, or reused in a different product. Recycling priorities FIGURE 5 Types of resource recovery and recycling. SOURCE: Gotoh, 1976.

For example, if recovered waste paper is of low quality and other technical and economic factors prevent reprocessing and reuse, the paper should first be recycled into the next lower grade paper product, then into a nonpaper product such as wallboard or compost, then into refuse-derived fuel to be eventually burned to recover energy in the form of steam or electricity. Several commodity-specific recycling rates and schedules for meeting the goals are provided by the Japanese government to gauge environmental progress in industry and to set goals for other industrial efforts to improve the environmental efficiency. Figure 6 shows the flow and balance of glass containers and cullet in 1992. The target cullet reuse rate of 55 percent by the end of FY 1995 was met and exceeded in 1992, when the reuse rate was found to be about 56 percent. Numerous other variables to track recycling progress could be defined such as cullet use rate excluding in-plant and bottlers' cullet, return rate of returnable bottles, returnable bottle use rate, and total glass recycling rate. These may be useful for gauging industry's environmental progress. SUMMARY The Japanese experience suggests the following: To improve the environmental efficiency of industrial ecosystems, close and well-coordinated collaboration between industry and government is indispensable.

APPENDIX 1 KEIDANREN GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT CHARTER Introduction Japan has been actively striving to protect the environment, promote health and safety, and use energy and resources more efficiently ever since pollution became a problem in the high-growth 1960s and especially since the two oil crises of the 1970s, and now has some of the most advanced technologies and systems in the world to reduce industrial pollution, enhance safety and hygiene, and conserve energy and other resources. Yet today's environmental problems are too critical to be dealt with solely through measures to prevent industrial pollution. If we are to minimize the load on the environment from, for example, waste disposal and water pollution generated in cities, society itself must be fundamentally changed. We must radically revise various social and economic systems, such as the layout of cities and the arrangement of transport networks, and we must also upgrade social infrastructure and, indeed, raise the consciousness of citizenry. On the international agenda are such world-scale problems as global warming, the depletion of tropical rain forests, desertification, acid rain, and pollution of the oceans. The international community's response to the problem of global warming in particular will be having profound effects on our ways of life and business. Naturally, there must be overall measures taken, but technological breakthrough will also be necessary. The problems are such that no country alone can come up with all the answers. The task before us is not merely one of rethinking the problems cause by the pursuit of affluence in a culture that encourages mass consumption; we must also come to grips with the global problems of poverty and population increase, aiming to hand over to future generations a healthy environment that allows sustainable development on a global scale. The governments, companies, and people of each nation must become more aware of their roles in this endeavor. People throughout the world must join hands to create new social and economic systems that allow the advancement of the welfare of all human beings and the conservation of the whole world's environment.

The business world, academic circles, and government must pool their resources to create innovative technologies for preserving the environment, conserving energy, and cutting back on resource consumption. While drawing on the Japanese experience in reconciling economic development with environmental protection, we must actively participate in international environmental undertakings. Concerning such problems as global warming, we should support the efforts on more scientific research into their causes and effects and also begin work immediately on the feasible countermeasures. By showing that it takes environmental problems seriously, the business world can gain the trust and sympathy of the public. This will foster a mutually beneficial relationship between producers and consumers, thereby encouraging the healthy development of the economy. With the above situation in mind, Keidanren offers the guidelines outlined below to its members. It is to be hoped that each member, always consulting with and seeking the understanding and cooperation of consumers, government officials, and others, will conduct its business in conformity with these guidelines. Basic Philosophy A company's existence is closely bound up with the global environment as well as with the community it is based in. In carrying on its activities, each company must maintain respect for human dignity, and strive toward a future society where the global environment is protected. We must aim to construct a society whose members cooperate together on environmental problems, a society where sustainable development on a global scale is possible, where companies enjoy a relationship of mutual trust with local citizens and consumers, and where they vigorously and freely develop their operations while preserving the environment. Each company must aim at being a good global corporate citizen, recognizing that grappling with environmental problems is essential to its own existence and its activities. Guidelines for Corporate Action Companies must carry on their business activities to contribute to the establishment of a new economic social system for realizing an environmentally protective society leading to the sustainable development. General Management Policies Companies should always consult the guidelines below in carrying on their activities. They must work to (1) protect the global environment and improve the local living environment, (2) take care to protect ecosystems and conserve resources, Page 248 Share Cite Suggested Citation:""Japan's Changing Environmental Policy, Government Initiatives, and Industry Responses.""

In this framework the natural flow (or circulation) of materials and energy that takes place in biological ecosystems becomes a model for more efficient industrial ""metabolism."" What industrial ecology is and how it may be applied to corporate environmentalism are the subject of The Industrial Green Game. This volume examines industrial circulation of materials, energy efficiency strategies, ""green"" accounting, life-cycle analysis, and other approaches for preventing pollution and improving performance. Corporate leaders report firsthand on ""green"" efforts at Ciba-Geigy, Volvo, Kennecott, and Norsk Hydro. And an update is provided on the award-winning industrial symbiosis project in Kalundborg, Denmark. The Industrial Green Game looks at issues of special concern to business, such as measuring and shaping public perceptions and marketing ""green"" products to consumers. It offers discussions of the appropriate roles of government and private business.

The ministry was formed in 2001 from the sub-cabinet level Environmental Agency established in 1971. The Minister of the Environment is a member of the Cabinet of Japan and is chosen by the Prime Minister, usually from among members of the Diet.[1][2] In March 2006, the then-Minister of the Environment Yuriko Koike, created a furoshiki cloth to promote its use in the modern world.[3] In August 2011, the Cabinet of Japan approved a plan to establish a new energy watchdog under the Environment Ministry,[4] and the Nuclear Regulation Authority was founded on September 19, 2012.[5] Contents 1 Cool Biz 2 Super Cool Biz 3 See also 4 References 5 External links Cool Biz[edit] The Ministry of the Environment began advocating the Cool Biz campaign in summer 2005 as a means to help reduce electric consumption by limiting use of air conditioning and allowing the wearing of less formal officewear. This idea was proposed by then-Minister of the Environment Yuriko Koike under Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. Super Cool Biz[edit] Following the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami in March 2011, the shut down of many nuclear power plants for safety reasons lead to energy shortages. To conserve energy, the government recommended setting air conditioners at 28 degrees Celsius, switching off computers not in use, and called for shifting work hours to the morning and taking more summer vacation than usual. The government then launched a Super Cool Biz campaign[6] to encourage workers to wear outfits appropriate for the office yet cool enough to endure the summer heat. Polo shirts and trainers are allowed, while jeans and sandals are also acceptable under certain circumstances.[7] June 1 marked the start of the Environment Ministry's campaign, with full-page newspaper ads and photos of ministry workers smiling rather self-consciously at their desks wearing polo shirts and colorful Okinawa kariyushi shirts.[8] The campaign was repeated in 2012[9] and 2013.[10] See also[edit] Wikinews has related news: Japan to use renewable energy Environmental issues in Japan References[edit] ^ ""Kankyō-shō"" [Ministry of the Environment].

He is the second son of former Prime Minister Junichirō Koizumi and the younger brother of actor Kotaro Koizumi. After graduating from university, Koizumi worked as a researcher at the Washington-based think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies, and became active politically as Young Leader of the Pacific Forum CSIS. He also spent time working as a political secretary for his father in the final years of his second term as Prime Minister. At the 2009 election, he was elected to the House of Representatives for the seat his father had occupied for more than 35 years. After the election of the Abe Government in 2012, Koizumi was appointed as a Vice-Minister for Reconstruction, focusing on the northeastern region of Japan that was devastated by the March 2011 tsunami and subsequent nuclear disaster. He publicly opposed his father's calls for Japan to abandon nuclear energy immediately. In 2019, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe appointed Koizumi to the Cabinet as Minister of the Environment, a role he retained when Yoshihide Suga succeeded Abe as Prime Minister in September 2020. Contents 1 Early life 2 Political career 3 Views 4 Popularity 5 Personal life 6 Ancestry 7 See also 8 References 9 External links Early life[edit] Koizumi grew up in Yokosuka, his father's home district, attending Kanto Gakuin University in Yokohama from elementary school through university with a Bachelor of Economics degree in 2004. When he was a student in junior high and senior high schools, he was engrossed in playing sports, especially baseball. He received his master's degree in political science from Columbia University. He spent one year as a part-time research fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and as Young Leader of the Pacific Forum CSIS before returning to Japan in 2007.[1] After that, he worked as a private secretary of Junichirō, his father. Political career[edit] Following his father's announced retirement in 2008, he was elected to his father's former seat representing the Kanagawa 11th district in the August 2009 general election, in which many other LDP seats were lost to the Democratic Party of Japan. He faced criticism for being a hereditary politician. He campaigned in a rented Toyota Prius with a volunteer staff.[2] Koizumi became head of the LDP's young legislators caucus in October 2011, a post previously held by Prime Ministers Takeshita, Uno, Kaifu, Abe and Asō. In February 2012, he started a project called ""Team 11,"" which sent members of the division to areas of the Tōhoku region affected by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami on the 11th of each month to talk to locals and report back on the state of the reconstruction efforts. The group had 82 members, all under the age of 45, as of March 2013. Some observers compared the group to the powerful ""Machimura faction"" led by Nobutaka Machimura in terms of its political weight.[3] He was critical of the LDP under party president Sadakazu Tanigaki. In his first meeting as a party officer, he stated that ""the image of the party is that it doesn't listen to the opinions of young people, has old thoughts and a hard head. That is why trust will not be restored.""[4] He argued in a November 2011 speech that the party's stance on the controversial Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement needed to be clarified.[5] He later advocated breaking up the LDP's agreement with the Democratic Party of Japan and Komeito to pass an overhaul of the social security and tax system, directly arguing to Tanigaki that the party's mission should be to take down the DPJ government and to restore LDP control, and drawing comparisons to his father's maverick reputation.[6] Koizumi broke ranks with the LDP in August 2012 as one of seven LDP legislators who refused to walk out of the no-confidence vote instigated by Ichiro Ozawa against Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda, in which the LDP and NK had agreed to throw out their votes. Although Koizumi voted for the no-confidence resolution, it was ultimately voted down 246–86.[7] He voted for Shigeru Ishiba against Shinzō Abe in the LDP leadership election of September 2012, but did not make his vote public until after the election in order to avoid influencing others' votes.[8] Koizumi was re-elected in the December 2012 general election, which restored LDP control of the government under Abe. In the subsequent House of Councillors election in July 2013, he focused his campaigning efforts on disaster zones, outlying islands and areas in rapid population decline, giving speeches in support of their local LDP candidates. Kenichi Tokoi, a nonfiction author who wrote a book about Koizumi, said that his goal was to shake as many individual hands as possible and to leave the impression that he was kind enough to visit them, something which he could not achieve by campaigning in big cities.[9] In October 2013, he was appointed Parliamentary Secretary in charge of Tohoku Recovery, in which capacity he would oversee post-disaster reconstruction efforts in Iwate Prefecture and Miyagi Prefecture. Ishiba, then secretary general of the LDP, stated that Koizumi ""made a very strong case"" with local disaster victims ""about what he wanted to do and why.""[10] Tokoi characterized this posting as a test of Koizumi's administrative ability.[9] Koizumi was reportedly considered for a formal cabinet post under the Abe government in the reshuffles of October 2015 and July 2017.[11][12] On 11 September 2019, Abe appointed Koizumi as Minister of the Environment.[13][14] He advocated for environmentalist policies, including ending Japan's use of nuclear and coal power, despite serving in a government considered skeptical of such policies.[15][16][17][18] However, he supports the construction of new coal-fired power stations in Japan, despite their particulate and greenhouse gas emissions. His support for the construction of two coal-fired power stations in Yokosuka has led him to be a ""a target of activists' wrath"".[19] In late August 2020, after the resignation of Shinzo Abe, Koizumi was named as one of his possible successor.[20] A Kyodo News survey showed that almost 9% of those surveyed recommended him for prime minister,[20] though some inside the party consider him too young to be in charge of the country.[21] He later formally withdrew his candidacy and endorsed Minister of Defense Tarō Kōno.[22] Views[edit] Like his father, Koizumi visits Yasukuni Shrine on 15 August, the anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War II. He visited in 2012[23] and again in 2013.[24] In a May 2013 interview with the Sankei Shimbun, he refused to comment on Osaka mayor Toru Hashimoto's controversial remarks on comfort women, characterizing the issue as one that should be discussed among experts and historians rather than politicians. He described the perceived nationalist shift in Japanese politics as ""Chinese propaganda"" and stated that the government needed to wage a better public relations campaign against it while focusing on the successful implementation of Abenomics. He also commented on the Japanese Constitution, stating that amendments were necessary but that there were more immediate problems to be solved: ""I go to the disaster zones in Tohoku every month, and the constitution has not come up even once as an issue when I walk down the street there.""[25] Koizumi was critical of the Abe government's decision to terminate a corporate tax surcharge intended to fund the Tohoku recovery, and views nuclear power as unsustainable in the long term, mirroring views that his father expressed in 2013.[10] He has expressed support for same-sex marriage. Even though he belongs to the conservative Liberal Democratic Party. Popularity[edit] Koizumi had a 75.6% approval rating at the start of his stint as parliamentary secretary for Tohoku recovery.[26] In a December 2013 TBS poll, he ranked second after Shinzo Abe as the most favoured candidate for prime minister, although 57% responded that they had no particular favoured candidate.[27] In April 2017, in the aftermath of the Moritomo Gakuen scandal surrounding Prime Minister Abe, polls by Yomiuri[28] and NTV[29] showed Koizumi as the most favoured LDP leader (and presumptive Prime Minister), surpassing both Abe and challenger Shigeru Ishiba.[30] Following the December 2012 election, the National Diet Building gift shop began selling ""Shinji-Rolls"" (進次ろうる), souvenir green tea-flavoured roll cakes branded with Koizumi's likeness. Shinji-Rolls became the gift shop's second most popular item in 2013, outselling souvenirs branded with the likenesses of LDP leaders Shigeru Ishiba and Taro Aso, and outsold only by manju bearing the likeness of Shinzo Abe.[31] In January 2020, Koizumi announced his plans to take two weeks of paternity leave when his first child is born.[32] Personal life[edit] On 7 August 2019, television announcer and news presenter Christel Takigawa announced that she married Shinjiro Koizumi. She gave birth to a son on 17 January 2020.[33] Ancestry[edit] Ancestors of Shinjirō Koizumi 8. Samejima Yazaemon 4. Jun'ya Koizumi 2. Junichirō Koizumi 20. Koizumi Yūhyōe 10. Koizumi Matajirō 21.

The Government of Japan consists of legislature, executive and judiciary branches and is based on popular sovereignty. The Government runs under the framework established by the Constitution of Japan, adopted in 1947. It is a unitary state, containing forty-seven administrative divisions, with the Emperor as its Head of State.[1] His role is ceremonial and he has no powers related to Government.[2] Instead, it is the Cabinet, comprising the Ministers of State and the Prime Minister, that directs and controls the Government and the civil service. The Cabinet has the executive power and is formed by the Prime Minister, who is the Head of Government.[3][4] He is designated by the National Diet and appointed to office by the Emperor.[5][6] The National Diet is the legislature, the organ of the Legislative branch. It is bicameral, consisting of two houses with the House of Councilors being the upper house, and the House of Representatives being the lower house. Its members are directly elected by the people, who are the source of sovereignty.[7] It is defined as the supreme organ of sovereignty in the Constitution. The Supreme Court and other inferior courts make up the Judicial branch and have all the judicial powers in the state. It has ultimate judicial authority to interpret the Japanese constitution and the power of judicial review. They are independent from the executive and the legislative branches.[8] Judges are designated or appointed by the Cabinet and never removed by the executive and the legislature except during impeachment.

During this period, effective power of the government resided in the Shōgun, who officially ruled the country in the name of the Emperor.[9] The Shoguns were the hereditary military governors, with their modern rank equivalent to a generalissimo. Although the Emperor was the sovereign who appointed the Shōgun, his roles were ceremonial and he took no part in governing the country.[10] This is often compared to the present role of the Emperor, whose official role is to appoint the Prime Minister.[11] The Meiji Restoration in 1872 led to the resignation of Shōgun Tokugawa Yoshinobu, agreeing to ""be the instrument for carrying out"" the Emperor's orders.[12] This event restored the country to Imperial rule and the proclamation of the Empire of Japan. In 1889, the Meiji Constitution was adopted in a move to strengthen Japan to the level of western nations, resulting in the first parliamentary system in Asia.[13] It provided a form of mixed constitutional-absolute monarchy, with an independent judiciary, based on the Prussian model of the time.[14] A new aristocracy known as the kazoku was established. It merged the ancient court nobility of the Heian period, the kuge, and the former daimyōs, feudal lords subordinate to the shōgun.[15] It also established the Imperial Diet, consisting of the House of Representatives and the House of Peers. Members of the House of Peers were made up of the Imperial Family, the Kazoku, and those nominated by the Emperor,[16] while members of the House of Representatives were elected by direct male suffrage.[17] Despite clear distinctions between powers of the executive branch and the Emperor in the Meiji Constitution, ambiguity and contradictions in the Constitution eventually led to a political crisis.[18] It also devalued the notion of civilian control over the military, which meant that the military could develop and exercise a great influence on politics.[19] Following the end of World War II, the present Constitution of Japan was adopted. It replaced the previous Imperial rule with a form of Western-style liberal democracy.[20] As of 2020, the Japan Research Institute found the national government is mostly analog, because only 7.5% (4,000 of the 55,000) administrative procedures can be completed entirely online. The rate is 7.8% at the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, 8% at the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, and only 1.3% at the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries.[21] On 12 February, 2021, Tetsushi Sakamoto was appointed as the Minister of Loneliness to alleviate social isolation and loneliness across different age groups and genders.[22] The Emperor[edit] Imperial Standard The Emperor of Japan (天皇) is the head of the Imperial Family and the ceremonial head of state. He is defined by the Constitution to be ""the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people"".[7] However, he is not the nominal Chief Executive and he possesses only certain ceremonially important powers. He has no real powers related to the Government as stated clearly in article 4 of the Constitution.[23] Article 6 of the Constitution of Japan delegates the Emperor the following ceremonial roles: Appointment of the Prime Minister as designated by the Diet. Appointment of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court as designated by the Cabinet. While the Cabinet is the source of executive power and most of its power is exercised directly by the Prime Minister, several of its powers are exercised by the Emperor. The powers exercised via the Emperor, as stipulated by Article 7 of the Constitution, are: Promulgation of amendments of the constitution, laws, cabinet orders and treaties. Convocation of the Diet. Dissolution of the House of Representatives. Proclamation of general election of members of the Diet. Attestation of the appointment and dismissal of Ministers of State and other officials as provided for by law, and of full powers and credentials of Ambassadors and Ministers. Attestation of general and special amnesty, commutation of punishment, reprieve, and restoration of rights. Awarding of honors. Attestation of instruments of ratification and other diplomatic documents as provided for by law. Receiving foreign ambassadors and ministers. Performance of ceremonial functions. The Emperor is known to hold the nominal ceremonial authority. For example, the Emperor is the only person that has the authority to appoint the Prime Minister, even though the Diet has the power to designate the person fitted for the position. One such example can be prominently seen in the 2009 Dissolution of the House of Representatives. The House was expected to be dissolved on the advice of the Prime Minister, but was temporarily unable to do so for the next general election, as both the Emperor and Empress were visiting Canada.[24][25] In this manner, the Emperor's modern role is often compared to those of the Shogunate period and much of Japan's history, whereby the Emperor held great symbolic authority but had little political power; which is often held by others nominally appointed by the Emperor himself. Today, a legacy has somewhat continued for a retired Prime Minister who still wields considerable power, to be called a Shadow Shogun (闇将軍).[26] Unlike his European counterparts, the Emperor is not the source of sovereign power and the government does not act under his name. Instead, the Emperor represents the State and appoints other high officials in the name of the State, in which the Japanese people hold sovereignty.[27] Article 5 of the Constitution, in accordance with the Imperial Household Law, allows a regency to be established in the Emperor's name, should the Emperor be unable to perform his duties.[28] On November 20, 1989, the Supreme Court ruled it doesn't have judicial power over the Emperor.[29] The Imperial House of Japan is said to be the oldest continuing hereditary monarchy in the world.[30] According to the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, Japan was founded by the Imperial House in 660 BC by Emperor Jimmu (神武天皇).[31] Emperor Jimmu was the first Emperor of Japan and the ancestor of all of the Emperors that followed.[32] He is, according to Japanese mythology, the direct descendant of Amaterasu (天照大御神), the sun goddess of the native Shinto religion, through Ninigi, his great-grandfather.[33][34] The Current Emperor of Japan (今上天皇) is Naruhito. He was officially enthroned on May 1, 2019, following the abdication of his father.[35][36] He is styled as His Imperial Majesty (天皇陛下), and his reign bears the era name of Reiwa (令和). Fumihito is the heir presumptive to the Chrysanthemum Throne. Executive[edit] The Executive branch of Japan is headed by the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is the head of the Cabinet, and is designated by the legislative organ, the National Diet.[5] The Cabinet consists of the Ministers of State and may be appointed or dismissed by the Prime Minister at any time.[37] Explicitly defined to be the source of executive power, it is in practice, however, mainly exercised by the Prime Minister. The practice of its powers is responsible to the Diet, and as a whole, should the Cabinet lose confidence and support to be in office by the Diet, the Diet may dismiss the Cabinet en masse with a motion of no confidence.[38] Prime Minister[edit] Crest of the Prime Minister of Japan The Prime Minister of Japan (内閣総理大臣) is designated by the National Diet and serves a term of four years or less; with no limits imposed on the number of terms the Prime Minister may hold. The Prime Minister heads the Cabinet and exercises ""control and supervision"" of the executive branch, and is the head of government and commander-in-chief of the Japan Self-Defense Forces.[39] The Prime Minister is vested with the power to present bills to the Diet, to sign laws, to declare a state of emergency, and may also dissolve the Diet's House of Representatives at will.[40] He or she presides over the Cabinet and appoints, or dismisses, the other Cabinet ministers.[37] Both houses of the National Diet designates the Prime Minister with a ballot cast under the run-off system. Under the Constitution, should both houses not agree on a common candidate, then a joint committee is allowed to be established to agree on the matter; specifically within a period of ten days, exclusive of the period of recess.[41] However, if both houses still do not agree to each other, the decision made by the House of Representatives is deemed to be that of the National Diet.[41] Upon designation, the Prime Minister is presented with their commission, and then formally appointed to office by the Emperor.[6] As a candidate designated by the Diet, he or she is required to report to the Diet whenever demanded.[42] The Prime Minister must also be both a civilian and a member of either house of the Diet.[43] For a list of Prime Ministers prior to 2001, see List of Prime Ministers of Japan.

The members of the Cabinet are appointed by the Prime Minister, and under the Cabinet Law, the number of members of the Cabinet appointed, excluding the Prime Minister, must be fourteen or less, but may only be increased to nineteen should a special need arise.[45][46] Article 68 of the Constitution states that all members of the Cabinet must be civilians and the majority of them must be chosen from among the members of either house of the National Diet.[47] The precise wording leaves an opportunity for the Prime Minister to appoint some non-elected Diet officials.[48] The Cabinet is required to resign en masse while still continuing its functions, till the appointment of a new Prime Minister, when the following situation arises: The Diet's House of Representatives passes a non-confidence resolution, or rejects a confidence resolution, unless the House of Representatives is dissolved within the next ten (10) days. When there is a vacancy in the post of the Prime Minister, or upon the first convocation of the Diet after a general election of the members of the House of Representatives. Conceptually deriving legitimacy from the Diet, whom it is responsible to, the Cabinet exercises its power in two different ways. In practice, much of its power is exercised by the Prime Minister, while others are exercised nominally by the Emperor.[3] Article 73 of the Constitution of Japan expects the Cabinet to perform the following functions, in addition to general administration: Administer the law faithfully; conduct affairs of state. Manage foreign affairs. Conclude treaties. However, it shall obtain prior or, depending on circumstances, subsequent approval of the Diet. Administer the civil service, in accordance with standards established by law. Prepare the budget, and present it to the Diet. Enact cabinet orders in order to execute the provisions of this Constitution and of the law. However, it cannot include penal provisions in such cabinet orders unless authorized by such law. Decide on general amnesty, special amnesty, commutation of punishment, reprieve, and restoration of rights. Under the Constitution, all laws and cabinet orders must be signed by the competent Minister and countersigned by the Prime Minister, before being formally promulgated by the Emperor. Also, all members of the Cabinet cannot be subject to legal action without the consent of the Prime Minister; however, without impairing the right to take legal action.[49] For an updated list of members of the Cabinet, see Current Cabinet of Japan.

Each ministry is headed by a Minister of State, which are mainly senior legislators, and are appointed from among the members of the Cabinet by the Prime Minister. The Cabinet Office, formally headed by the Prime Minister, is an agency that handles the day-to-day affairs of the Cabinet. The ministries are the most influential part of the daily-exercised executive power, and since few ministers serve for more than a year or so necessary to grab hold of the organisation, most of its power lies within the senior bureaucrats.[52] Cabinet Office National Public Safety Commission National Police Agency Consumer Affairs Agency Financial Services Agency Fair Trade Commission Food Safety Commission Personal Information Protection Commission Imperial Household Agency ※Manages the Imperial Household.

It reviews government expenditures and submits an annual report to the Diet. Article 90 of the Constitution of Japan and the Board of Audit Act of 1947 gives this body substantial independence from both controls.[55] Legislative[edit] National Diet Building, Nagatachō, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo Main article: National Diet The Legislative branch organ of Japan is the National Diet (国会). It is a bicameral legislature, composing of a lower house, the House of Representatives, and an upper house, the House of Councillors. Empowered by the Constitution to be ""the highest organ of State power"" and the only ""sole law-making organ of the State"", its houses are both directly elected under a parallel voting system and is ensured by the Constitution to have no discrimination on the qualifications of each members; whether be it based on ""race, creed, sex, social status, family origin, education, property or income"". The National Diet, therefore, reflects the sovereignty of the people; a principle of popular sovereignty whereby the supreme power lies within, in this case, the Japanese people.[7][56] The Diet responsibilities includes the making of laws, the approval of the annual national budget, the approval of the conclusion of treaties and the selection of the Prime Minister. In addition, it has the power to initiate draft constitutional amendments, which, if approved, are to be presented to the people for ratification in a referendum before being promulgated by the Emperor, in the name of the people.[57] The Constitution also enables both houses to conduct investigations in relation to government, demand the presence and testimony of witnesses, and the production of records, as well as allowing either house of the Diet to demand the presence of the Prime Minister or the other Minister of State, in order to give answers or explanations whenever so required.[42] The Diet is also able to impeach Court judges convicted of criminal or irregular conduct. The Constitution, however, does not specify the voting methods, the number of members of each house, and all other matters pertaining to the method of election of the each members, and are thus, allowed to be determined for by law.[58] Under the provisions of the Constitution and by law, all adults aged over 18 are eligible to vote, with a secret ballot and a universal suffrage, and those elected have certain protections from apprehension while the Diet is in session.[59] Speeches, debates, and votes cast in the Diet also enjoy parliamentary privileges. Each house is responsible for disciplining its own members, and all deliberations are public unless two-thirds or more of those members present passes a resolution agreeing it otherwise. The Diet also requires the presence of at least one-third of the membership of either house in order to constitute a quorum.[60] All decisions are decided by a majority of those present, unless otherwise stated by the Constitution, and in the case of a tie, the presiding officer has the right to decide the issue. A member cannot be expelled, however, unless a majority of two-thirds or more of those members present passes a resolution therefor.[61] Under the Constitution, at least one session of the Diet must be convened each year. The Cabinet can also, at will, convoke extraordinary sessions of the Diet and is required to, when a quarter or more of the total members of either house demands it.[62] During an election, only the House of Representatives is dissolved. The House of Councillors is however, not dissolved but only closed, and may, in times of national emergency, be convoked for an emergency session.[63] The Emperor both convokes the Diet and dissolves the House of Representatives, but only does so on the advice of the Cabinet. For bills to become Law, they are to be first passed by both houses of the National Diet, signed by the Ministers of State, countersigned by the Prime Minister, and then finally promulgated by the Emperor; however, without specifically giving the Emperor the power to oppose legislation. House of Representatives[edit] Chamber of the House of Representatives The House of Representatives of Japan (衆議院) is the Lower house, with the members of the house being elected once every four years, or when dissolved, for a four-year term.[64] As of November 18, 2017, it has 465 members. Of these, 176 members are elected from 11 multi-member constituencies by a party-list system of proportional representation, and 289 are elected from single-member constituencies. 233 seats are required for majority. The House of Representatives is the more powerful house out of the two, it is able to override vetoes on bills imposed by the House of Councillors with a two-thirds majority. It can, however, be dissolved by the Prime Minister at will.[40] Members of the house must be of Japanese nationality; those aged 18 years and older may vote, while those aged 25 years and older may run for office in the lower house.[59] The legislative powers of the House of Representatives is considered to be more powerful than that of the House of Councillors. While the House of Councillors has the ability to veto most decisions made by the House of Representatives, some however, can only be delayed. This includes the legislation of treaties, the budget, and the selection of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister, and collectively his Cabinet, can in turn, however, dissolve the House of Representatives whenever intended.[40] While the House of Representatives is considered to be officially dissolved upon the preparation of the document, the House is only formally dissolved by the dissolution ceremony.[65] The dissolution ceremony of the House is as follows: The document is rubber stamped by the Emperor, and wrapped in a purple silk cloth; an indication of a document of state act, done on behalf of the people. The document is passed on to the Chief Cabinet Secretary at the House of Representatives President's reception room. The document is taken to the Chamber for preparation by the General-Secretary. The General-Secretary prepares the document for reading by the Speaker. The Speaker of the House of Representatives promptly declares the dissolution of the House. The House of Representatives is formally dissolved. It is customary that, upon the dissolution of the House, members will shout the Three Cheers of Banzai (萬歲).[65][66] House of Councillors[edit] Chamber of the House of Councillors The House of Councillors of Japan (参議院) is the Upper house, with half the members of the house being elected once every three years, for a six-year term. As of November 18, 2017, it has 242 members. Of these, 73 are elected from the 47 prefectural districts, by single non-transferable votes, and 48 are elected from a nationwide list by proportional representation with open lists. The House of Councillors cannot be dissolved by the Prime Minister.[63] Members of the house must be of Japanese nationality; those aged 18 years and older may vote, while those aged 30 years and older may run for office in the upper house.[59] As the House of Councillors can veto a decision made by the House of Representatives, the House of Councillors can cause the House of Representatives to reconsider its decision. The House of Representatives however, can still insist on its decision by overwriting the veto by the House of Councillors with a two-thirds majority of its members present. Each year, and when required, the National Diet is convoked at the House of Councillors, on the advice of the Cabinet, for an extra or an ordinary session, by the Emperor. A short speech is, however, usually first made by the Speaker of the House of Representatives before the Emperor proceeds to convoke the Diet with his Speech from the throne.[67] Judicial[edit] Supreme Court Building, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo Tokyo High Court Building Main article: Judicial system of Japan The Judicial branch of Japan consists of the Supreme Court, and four other lower courts; the High Courts, District Courts, Family Courts and Summary Courts.[68] Divided into four basic tiers, the Court's independence from the executive and legislative branches are guaranteed by the Constitution, and is stated as: ""no extraordinary tribunal shall be established, nor shall any organ or agency of the Executive be given final judicial power""; a feature known as the Separation of Powers.[8] Article 76 of the Constitution states that all the Court judges are independent in the exercise of their own conscience and that they are only bounded by the Constitution and the laws.[69] Court judges are removable only by public impeachment, and can only be removed, without impeachment, when they are judicially declared mentally or physically incompetent to perform their duties.[70] The Constitution also explicitly denies any power for executive organs or agencies to administer disciplinary actions against judges.[70] However, a Supreme Court judge may be dismissed by a majority in a referendum; of which, must occur during the first general election of the National Diet's House of Representatives following the judge's appointment, and also the first general election for every ten years lapse thereafter.[71] Trials must be conducted, with judgment declared, publicly, unless the Court ""unanimously determines publicity to be dangerous to public order or morals""; with the exception for trials of political offenses, offenses involving the press, and cases wherein the rights of people as guaranteed by the Constitution, which cannot be deemed and conducted privately.[72] Court judges are appointed by the Cabinet, in attestation of the Emperor, while the Chief Justice is appointed by the Emperor, after being nominated by the Cabinet; which in practice, known to be under the recommendation of the former Chief Justice.[73] The Legal system in Japan has been historically influenced by Chinese law; developing independently during the Edo period through texts such as Kujikata Osadamegaki.[74] It has, however, changed during the Meiji Restoration, and is now largely based on the European civil law; notably, the civil code based on the German model still remains in effect.[75] A quasi-jury system has recently came into use, and the legal system also includes a bill of rights since May 3, 1947.[76] The collection of Six Codes makes up the main body of the Japanese statutory law.[75] All Statutory Laws in Japan are required to be rubber stamped by the Emperor with the Privy Seal of Japan (天皇御璽), and no Law can take effect without the Cabinet's signature, the Prime Minister's countersignature and the Emperor's promulgation.[77][78][79][80][81] Supreme Court[edit] The Supreme Court of Japan (最高裁判所) is the court of last resort and has the power of Judicial review; as defined by the Constitution to be ""the court of last resort with power to determine the constitutionality of any law, order, regulation or official act"".[82] The Supreme Court is also responsible for nominating judges to lower courts and determining judicial procedures. It also oversees the judicial system, overseeing activities of public prosecutors, and disciplining judges and other judicial personnel.[83] High Courts[edit] The High Courts of Japan (高等裁判所) has the jurisdiction to hear appeals to judgments rendered by District Courts and Family Courts, excluding cases under the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. Criminal appeals are directly handled by the High Courts, but Civil cases are first handled by District Courts. There are eight High Courts in Japan: the Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Hiroshima, Fukuoka, Sendai, Sapporo, and Takamatsu High Courts.[83] Penal system[edit] The Penal system of Japan (矯正施設) is operated by the Ministry of Justice. It is part of the criminal justice system, and is intended to resocialize, reform, and rehabilitate offenders. The ministry's Correctional Bureau administers the adult prison system, the juvenile correctional system, and three of the women's guidance homes,[84] while the Rehabilitation Bureau operates the probation and the parole systems.[85] Local government[edit] Administrative divisions of Japan Administrative divisionsof Japan Prefectural Prefectures Sub-prefectural Subprefectures Municipal Designated cities Core cities Special cities Cities Special wards (Tokyo) Towns Villages Sub-municipal Wards vte According to Article 92 of the Constitution, the local governments of Japan (地方公共団体) are local public entities whose body and functions are defined by law in accordance with the principle of local autonomy.[86][87] The main law that defines them is the Local Autonomy Law.[88][89]　They are given limited executive and legislative powers by the Constitution. Governors, mayors and members of assemblies are constitutionally elected by the residents. The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications intervenes significantly in local government, as do other ministries. This is done chiefly financially because many local government jobs need funding initiated by national ministries. This is dubbed as the ""thirty-percent autonomy"".[90] The result of this power is a high level of organizational and policy standardization among the different local jurisdictions allowing them to preserve the uniqueness of their prefecture, city, or town. Some of the more collectivist jurisdictions, such as Tokyo and Kyoto, have experimented with policies in such areas as social welfare that later were adopted by the national government.[90] Local authorities[edit] Japan is divided into forty-seven administrative divisions, the prefectures are: one metropolitan district (Tokyo), two urban prefectures (Kyoto and Osaka), forty-three rural prefectures, and one ""district"", Hokkaidō. Large cities are subdivided into wards, and further split into towns, or precincts, or subprefectures and counties. Cities are self-governing units administered independently of the larger jurisdictions within which they are located. In order to attain city status, a jurisdiction must have at least 500,000 inhabitants, 60 percent of whom are engaged in urban occupations. There are self-governing towns outside the cities as well as precincts of urban wards. Like the cities, each has its own elected mayor and assembly. Villages are the smallest self-governing entities in rural areas. They often consist of a number of rural hamlets containing several thousand people connected to one another through the formally imposed framework of village administration. Villages have mayors and councils elected to four-year terms.[91][92] Structure[edit] Each jurisdiction has a chief executive, called a governor (知事, chiji) in prefectures and a mayor (市町村長, shichōsonchō) in municipalities. Most jurisdictions also have a unicameral assembly (議会, gikai), although towns and villages may opt for direct governance by citizens in a general assembly (総会, sōkai). Both the executive and assembly are elected by popular vote every four years.[93][94][95] Local governments follow a modified version of the separation of powers used in the national government. An assembly may pass a vote of no confidence in the executive, in which case the executive must either dissolve the assembly within ten days or automatically lose their office. Following the next election, however, the executive remains in office unless the new assembly again passes a no confidence resolution.[88] The primary methods of local lawmaking are local ordinance (条例, jōrei) and local regulations (規則, kisoku). Ordinances, similar to statutes in the national system, are passed by the assembly and may impose limited criminal penalties for violations (up to 2 years in prison and/or 1 million yen in fines). Regulations, similar to cabinet orders in the national system, are passed by the executive unilaterally, are superseded by any conflicting ordinances, and may only impose a fine of up to 50,000 yen.[91] Local governments also generally have multiple committees such as school boards, public safety committees (responsible for overseeing the police), personnel committees, election committees and auditing committees.[96] These may be directly elected or chosen by the assembly, executive or both.[90] All prefectures are required to maintain departments of general affairs, finance, welfare, health, and labor. Departments of agriculture, fisheries, forestry, commerce, and industry are optional, depending on local needs. The Governor is responsible for all activities supported through local taxation or the national government.[90][94] See also[edit] Japan portal Politics portal Japanese honors system Politics of Japan References[edit] ^ ""The World Factbook Japan"".

136,"Attorneys in Japan - Wikipedia Attorneys in Japan From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search In Japan, attorneys at law (弁護士, bengoshi, lit. ""advocate"") form the base of the country's legal community. Contents 1 History 1.1 Pre-Meiji restoration 1.2 Meiji restoration 1.3 Post-World War II 2 The legal industry 3 Qualification 3.1 Bar examination 3.2 Legal Training and Research Institute of Supreme Court 4 Bar association membership 4.1 Female attorneys 4.2 Membership for foreign attorneys 4.3 Corporate membership 5 See also 6 References 7 External links History[edit] Pre-Meiji restoration[edit] Historically, Japanese customs instituted an avoidance of legal involvement, based upon Confucian doctrines, and Japanese principles of harmony;[1] anyone brought before a court for a criminal or civil matter suffered public and private humiliation, since they disrupted harmony.[1] Nevertheless, by the 18th century, innkeepers in Edo began offering simple legal services for guests. They were known as Kujishi.[2] By the 19th century, references began to appear in Japanese literature on the role of ""European-style"" lawyers.[2] Officially recognized legal representatives in civil trials, known as daigennin, began to appear by the mid-19th century.[3] No legal training was required to be a daigennin.[3] Meiji restoration[edit] Regulation of legal professionals began during the Meiji Restoration. In 1890, the Criminal Code was amended, which recognized the right to legal representation during a criminal trial.[3] The state's representative at the trial, known as a Procurator, was given the prestige of being a government official.[3] By association, it unofficially granted a modicum of official status to the daigennin.[3] The government also required the establishment of bar associations at each district court,[3] and by 1893, the Lawyer's Law was promulgated, officially regulating the legal profession by setting standards for, as well as legitimatize, attorneys at law.[3] Post-World War II[edit] The Attorney Act (弁護士法, bengoshihō) was promulgated in 1949, which officially laid down the mission of an attorney at law, as well as establishing other requirements for those in the profession.[4] The legal industry[edit] The legal profession in Japan (hōsō) comprises judges, prosecutors and attorneys. In Japan, judges are not selected from experienced lawyers, but instead are selected after the one-year of mandatory ""Legal Training Research Institute"". More than 100 universities have an undergraduate law faculty, which means that many people study law at the undergraduate level and go work for companies in a role that is unrelated to law. However, to become a lawyer, it is necessary to go to law school, pass the bar exam, and complete the LTRI. As of August 2014, there are 35,031 attorneys registered with bar associations in Japan,[5] which is up from 22,049 in April 2005.[6] Due to cultural traditions, Japanese have rarely used lawsuits as a means to settle disputes.[7] With the rise of patent-disputes and international mergers, however, Japan is facing a shortage of lawyers, and the government has allowed universities to offer graduate courses on law, in order to ease the shortage.[7] The push to produce lawyers has also been reflected in the demographics of the legal community, where 25.3% of the lawyers surveyed in 2008 had only been admitted to the bar for less than 5 years.[8] Starting salaries for Japanese attorneys are typically around 10 million yen (US$100,000) in established law firms, and about half as much in Japanese companies. In-house counsel are still relatively rare in Japan, with only 770 of the 32,000 registered bengoshi working in corporate law departments as of January 2013.[9] Japanese bengoshi have a lapel pin of a balance surrounded by a sunflower, respectively symbolizing justice/liberty (sunflower) and fairness/equality (balance). Foreign law firms have been permitted to hire Japanese attorneys since 2005, and some such firms such as Morrison & Foerster and White & Case have built large Japanese law practices that handle domestic matters for domestic clients. Some foreign firms that built bengoshi practices under this system, such as Linklaters and Allen & Overy, have since downsized or eliminated their bengoshi teams, while others such as Herbert Smith Freehills elected to rely on referral relationships with the Big Four law firms rather than competing with them by employing bengoshi within the firm.[10] Qualification[edit] With several minor exceptions, attorneys at law are required to pass a national bar examination (司法試験, shihō shiken, lit. ""legal examination"") followed by one year of internship, supervised by the Legal Research and Training Institute (司法研修所, Shihō Kenshūjo) of the Supreme Court of Japan. There were 72 law schools as of July 2013 in Japan. Applications in law school in Japan has been declining sharply from approximately 70,000 applicants in 2004 to approximately 20,000 in 2015. This is due to the high tuition, difficulty of finding employment, and the pre-examination whose enrollment has increased. The types of quasi-lawyers are patent agents (benrishi), tax agents (zerishi), judicial scriveners (shiho shoshi), and administrative scriveners (gyosei shoshi). Bar examination[edit] Before 2006, the bar examination consisted of three stages. The first stage, held in May, consisted of 60 multiple choice questions regarding constitutional law, civil law and criminal law. The second stage, held over two days in July, consisted of twelve essay questions regarding constitutional law, civil law, criminal law, commercial law, civil procedure law and criminal procedure law. The final stage, held in October, was an oral examination regarding constitutional law, civil law, criminal law, civil procedure law and criminal procedure law. Final results were published in mid-November. On average, 40,000–50,000 people took the first stage, 7,000–8,000 qualified for the second stage, and only 1,500 qualified for the oral examination each year. In 2006, a new bar examination was instituted with only two stages. The first stage is a one-day short-answer examination concerning the six laws as well as administrative law. The second stage is a three-day essay examination concerning public law, civil law and criminal law, as well as subjects that can be selected by the examinee (including labor law, environmental law, public international law, and private international law). In addition, a law school requirement was introduced. All bar examination participants must complete a two or three-year graduate law program, and are limited to taking the examination within five years after graduation. Those who have not graduated from law school may take the bar examination after passing a preliminary qualifying examination (""Yobi-Shiken""). But passing a preliminary exam is still a minor path and most people are from law school. In 2015, the pass rate for the pre-examination was 3%. This path allows to skip law school and thus avoid paying high tuition. Japanese Bar exam is known as one of the most difficult exams in the world. Although the bar pass rates are getting higher after the structural reform in 2006, only around 20% of the law school graduates pass the bar. Therefore, the top law schools in Japan are competing with each other by achieving higher bar pass rate. Students can only attempt to pass the bar 5 times, after which they are disqualified. Until 2013, they could only attempt the bar examination 3 times. Most students study at independent private schools in order to pass the bar examination, in addition to law school. The average age of those passing the bar examination is 28–29 years old. Legal Training and Research Institute of Supreme Court[edit] Those who have passed the bar examination participate in a one-year training process for studying practical skills (the skills for judges, prosecutors, and lawyers) in the LTRI. The training at the LTRI consist of (1) collective training (classes in the classroom); (2) field training (apprentices to judges, prosecutors and law offices). LTRI focuses on teaching the litigation skills. When the students pass the final examination (nikai shiken) at the LTRI, they become lawyers, prosecutors or judges. Prosecutors and judges are handpicked by the LTRI. Bar association membership[edit] In addition to passing bar examinations, an attorney must also be a member of the bar association (弁護士会, bengoshikai) for the prefecture where the law office is located. According to a 2008 survey by the Japanese Federation of Bar Associations (JFBA), 39.4% of all lawyers belong to the three Tokyo bar associations (Tokyo Bar Association, First Tokyo Bar Association, and Second Tokyo Bar Association).[8] Female attorneys[edit] As of August 2014, there were 6,326 female attorneys in Japan that were admitted to the bar,[11] comprising about 18% of Japanese lawyers. Membership for foreign attorneys[edit] A total of 412 foreign-law attorneys were registered as of April 1, 2018.[12] Before World War II, attorneys qualified in foreign countries could join a Japanese bar with special permission from the Supreme Court. These individuals were referred to as quasi-members (準会員, junkaiin) of the bar. None remain in practice today.[5] The quasi-membership was abolished by judicial reforms in 1955,[5] and was replaced by the attorney at foreign law (外国法事務弁護士, gaikokuhō jimu bengoshi) membership in 1986. Attorneys in Okinawa who had been admitted as U.S. attorneys before the repatriation in 1972 were admitted as Japanese attorneys. They are classified by the Japanese Federation of Bar Associations (JFBA) as ""Special members in Okinawa"", and nine of them are still in practice as of August 2014.[5] Corporate membership[edit] Large law firms have been organized in Tokyo, Osaka and other major cities, and have grown dramatically in recent years. Since 2002, these law firms can also join as members in their own right.[5] They are classified by the JFBA as Legal Profession Corporation (弁護士法人, bengoshi hōjin),[5][13] and there are 775 law firms who joined the bar in this capacity as of August 2014.[5] See also[edit] Judicial system of Japan Phoenix Wright References[edit] ^ a b Uchtmann, Donald; Blessen, Richard; Maloney, Vince.

We would be delighted to receive your comments on how we can improve this website. History Purpose Organization Activities Membership 【History】 The Japan Bar Association was established in October 1948, three years after the end of the Second World War. The first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Mr. Tadahiko Mibuchi, took initiative in organising the original body of the association, and Attorney General, Mr. Yosio Suzuki, Prosecutor General, Mr. Seita Fukui, and the President of The Japan Federation of Bar Associations (a voluntary body of many local bar associations), Mr. Shinkichi Unno, actively helped Mr. Mibuchi in the organisation. Leading academics, Dr. Kotaro Tanaka, Dr. Sakae Wagatsuma, and Dr. Hajime Kaneko, were invited to join in the organisation. These academics were Professors of the University of Tokyo and were nationally well-known. Dr. Tanaka later became the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Japan and the Justice of the International Court of Justice in the Hague. On 20 March 1952, the Charter of the Japan Bar Association was promulgated, and Mr. Chuzaburo Arima was elected to the first Chairperson of the Association. Following this establishment process, 8 branches were established in Fukuoka (Kyushu) and Sapporo (Hokkaido) in the same year; Nagoya (Chubu), Hiroshima (Chugoku), and Takamatsu (Shikoku) in 1953; Sendai (Tohoku) and Tokyo (Kanto) in 1954; Kinki [Kyoto, Osaka and Kobe] in 1956. On 2 December 1958, Mr. Shunzo Kobayashi was elected to the second Chairperson of the Association. Mr. Kobayashi proposed to start the publication of “The Rule of Law”, periodical of the Association. Many celebrated Justices and Academics were invited by the Association. Professor Cavers and Professor Gluck at Harvard Law School, and Professor A.L. Goodhart at Oxford, were some examples. On 28th November 1960, Mr. Hachiro Fujita was elected to the third Chairperson of the Association. He made a plan of “legal appointment system of judges on the basis of practice experience as attorneys” in cooperation with the “World Peace Through Law”, whose international conference was held on 17 September 1961 in Asia [Tokyo?]. On 27th November 1963, Mr. Yuiichiro Tanimura was elected to the fourth Chairperson of the Association. Professor and Doctor Ryuichi Hirano, once the President of the University of Tokyo, together with many prominent lawyers of Japan, investigated “legal consciousness of the people” and established a “Commisson for the Research of Legal Systems”. The Association also involved in the discussion of “the Matter of Universities Autonomy” and in the research of “Historical Development of Japanese Legal Systems”. In the meantime, Baron H.W. Shawcross from the United Kingdom and G Muller Chief Justice of Constitutional Court in Germany visited the Association and gave lectures. In 1969, Mr. Daijiro Kikkawa was elected to the fifth Chairperson of the Association. Professor N.L. Nathanson, North-Western University, visited the Association and gave a lecture on quasi-judicial bodies. The Association discussed the matter of professional ethics for judges and attorneys in 1972. On 19 November 1973, the Association was reorganised as “The Chartered Japan Bar Associaton” On 21 April 1979, Mr. Ekizo Fujibayashi, former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Japan, was elected to the 6th Chairperson of the Association. Mr. Fujibayashi emphasized the importance of international exchanges and cooperation. On 8 February 1981, Warren E. Burger was invited to the Association and gave a lecture on legal profession. In 1980 through 1994, the Association contributed for legislative and judicial reforms in various areas of law and practice: In 1980, Professor Ichiro Kato (once the President of the University of Tokyo), Professor Akio Takeuchi, and Professor Koji Shindo, together with many professional lawyers, worked on “consumer protection”. In 1981, Professor Kouya Matsuo, Mr. Yosio Suzuki (Attorney General), Professor Masahito Inoue, together with many professional lawyers, worked on “criminal trial”. More recently, the Association held a conference to discuss a few forms of “jury system”, which eventually led to the introduction of a new criminal trial system called “Saibanin System”. This is a system of criminal trial in which 3 professional judges, together with 6 lay judges (who are elected like jurors in the United States of America), adjudicate serious criminal cases. On 25 March 1993, the Associated celebrated its 40th anniversary and reviewed its past activities. Major participants were Mr. Tsuneo Ohuchi and Mr. Seiichi Kishi, former Justices of the Supreme Court, Mr. Ryozo Katsuo, Mr. Norimasa Yasaki, Mr. Teruo Takemura, Mr. Hifumi Tsujinaka, Mr. Yorihiro Naito, Mr. Hideo Hara, Chairperson Ekizo Fujibayashi, Professor Akira Mikazuki, Mr. Hideo Suzuki, Mr. Keigo Ohira, Mr. Tomihiro Fujii, and Professor Kinko Yoshida. On 16 May 1994, Mr. Tsuneo Ohuchi, former Justice of the Supreme Court, was elected to the 7th Chairperson of the Association. In the period between 1994 and 2007, the Association contributed to a large scale judicial reform: Special committees were formed to discuss the matters of “law school education”, “ADR”, and several others. Judge Tohji Tao interviewed Professor Akira Mikazuki, a former Minister of Justice, to hear many problems of the judicial reform. In April 2002, the special issue of “Rule of Law” (No. 125) was published to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the Association. In 2005, a permanent study group was formed to study recent leading civil court decisions. In May 2007, Mr. Hideo Chikusa, former Justice of the Supreme Court, was elected to the 8th Chairperson of the Association. In June 2015, Mr. Seishi Kanetsuki, former Justice of the Supreme Court, was elected to the 9th Chairperson of the Association. ▲Page Top 【Purpose】 The Charter of the Japan Bar Association, article 3, provides that “the Association shall be aimed at promotion of judiciary, enhancement of legal profession, progress of academic studies”.

141,"日本弁護士連合会：Membership HOME > About the JFBA > About us > What is the JFBA? > Membership About us President's Message What is the JFBA? Organization Our Officers Committees JFBA Rules and Regulation JFBA brochure Access to Bar Associations Building Mission Statement Activities The Japanese Judicial System Publications Membership The JFBA is a federal body comprised of 52 local bar associations in Japan, individual attorneys, legal professional corporations, registered foreign lawyers (gaikokuho-jimu-bengoshi) and other members. Attorneys, legal professional corporations, and registered foreign lawyers should register with the JFBA at the same time when they are admitted to local bar associations. Therefore, all attorneys, legal professional corporations, and registered foreign lawyers in Japan form the JFBA. It possesses a unique autonomy free from supervision by government agencies, and is the sole and supreme organization that guides, liaises with, and supervises all attorneys, legal professional corporations, registered foreign lawyers, and the 52 local bar associations, to maintain the dignity of and to improve and advance the administration of its members. Local Bar Associations Japan has 52 local bar associations, one for each of the 50 district court jurisdictions with the exception of Tokyo, where three bar associations existed before the promulgation of the Attorney Act. Local bar associations consist of attorneys, legal professional corporations, and registered foreign lawyers. The 52 local bar associations also have the authority to guide, supervise and liaise with their member attorneys, legal professional corporations and registered foreign lawyers (however, with regard to the registered foreign lawyers, the registration, screening of qualifications, and disciplinary actions shall be performed by the JFBA), and their authority overlaps with JFBA's authority in this respect. However, it is understood that the local bar associations should, in the first place, guide, liaise with, and supervise their members, and that the JFBA will directly guide, liaise with, and supervise in case the local bar associations do not guide, liaise with, or supervise, or where it is deemed inappropriate for them to do so. In addition, the JFBA is to guide, liaise with, and supervise the 52 local bar associations, and as a particular example, the JFBA is to approve the establishment and amendment of the rules of local bar associations, to receive reports on the resolutions of the General Meetings of the local bar associations, and to nullify resolutions of the General Meetings where they harm the public interest. As a self-regulatory organization, the JFBA provides guidance, liaison, and supervision through its activities such as the registration, screening of qualifications, and disciplinary actions against the attorneys, legal professional corporations and registered foreign lawyers. In addition, the JFBA is performing a significant role related to important issues such as the redressing of human rights abuses and the improvement and reform of the justice system, by vigorously committing to various activities related to the protection of human rights; research and submission of opinions concerning revision of various laws; participation in providing relief to consumers and a commitment to issues concerning pollution and the environment; improvement of criminal procedures; and a judicial reform movement to open the justice system to citizens. Attorneys (Bengoshi) Any person qualified to practice law in Japan becomes an attorney as well as a member of the JFBA by being listed on the JFBA's Roster of Attorneys through the bar association to which she/he chooses to belong. Legal Professional Corporations Since April 2002, attorneys have been allowed to form corporations (legal professional corporations) for the purpose of engaging in legal practice. Upon incorporation, the legal professional corporation becomes a member of the local bar association of the district in which the office is established as well as a member of the JFBA. The system of legal professional corporations aims to enable attorneys to provide a variety of highly specialized legal services in a stable manner and to continue providing services for clients as a corporation by means of corporate organizations. Legal professional corporations may establish branch offices. Registered Foreign Lawyers (Gaikokuho Jimu Bengoshi) Registered Foreign Lawyers are those approved to engage in legal services in Japan related to the laws of the jurisdictions other than Japan where they are qualified to practice. They are required to have their names listed on the Roll of Registered Foreign Lawyers maintained by the JFBA with the approval of the Minister of Justice. This system was introduced by the Act on Special Measures concerning the Handling of Legal Services by Foreign Lawyers and the 1987 amendment of the JFBA's Articles of Association. Other Members In addition, the JFBA also has, for historical reasons, ""quasi-member"" and ""special member"" categories for those who provide similar legal services as attorneys in specific fields or geographical areas.

(July 2012) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Created 1929 in France, as part of the Catholic social movement, the JEC was formed by students from the ACJF (Association Catholique de la Jeunesse Française) wishing to minister to other catholic students. The movement organised specialist branches. In 1935 the JEC, opposed Nazism and grew rapidly, in 1936, their first national convention had 4000 participants. JEC movement grew in the spirit of the Specialized Catholic Action movements that were inspired by Joseph Cardijn (the founder of the Young Christian Workers) with the methodology of See-Judge-Act. The JEC was a significant operator in the French resistance during World War II and continued to play a role in French political life until the 1960s. JEC members included numerous members of the resistance, politicians, media and university people, among them: Jacques Delors, Pascal Lamy, Joseph Fontanet, Gilbert Dru, Pierre Alviset, René Rémond, André de Péretti, Patrick Viveret, Pierre Rosanvallon, Geneviève Latreille [fr], Antoine Spire, Jean-Pierre Sueur, Georges Montaron, Christophe Hondelatte, Claude-François Jullien, Roger-Henri Guerrand, Renaud Sainsaulieu, Jean-Marie Vincent, Jean-Yves Le Drian, and Jacques Bugnicourt. Jec Camping Fire, Property of Jec Syria In the 1960s the JEC denounced torture and the French government's fighting against Algerian independence; this caused tensions with the bishops of the Roman Catholic Church in France. As a result, in 1965, the Church removed its mandate from the association. This engagement with the church lead to schism within the JEC, which lasted until the reconstruction in the 1980s. Today[edit] Today the JEC continues its evangelistic mission amongst its members. Their objectives are to make students more aware of their social responsibilities and to help them maintain their faith. The JEC encourages its members to work for social change in their own environment.[1][2] The JEC has a General Consultative Status with the Economic and Social Commission (ECOSOC) of the United Nations, and an Operational Status with UNESCO in 1998. JEC is recognized by the Holy See and since the World Council of Kampala in 2007, has the private juridical statute according to the Canon Law 298-311 and 321-329. Objectives[edit] A. Evangelize student milieu and promote students apostolate, by responding to their specific needs and stressing their responsibility. B. Bring together students seeking community; give them a space for formations and actions in the social vision of the Church at various levels. C. Promote a global solidarity among students and young people for joint reflections and actions leading for a more equitable social order. D. Give students more resources, pedagogic and methodology to integrate their Christian faith to their intellectual and social lives.

159,"THE JEUNESSE ETUDIANTE CATHOLIQUE INTERNATIONALE - The spirit of Vatican II : Western European progressive catholicism in the long sixties Home Log in / Register Accounting Business & Finance Communication Computer Science Economics Education Engineering Environment Geography Health History Language & Literature Law Management Marketing Mathematics Political science Philosophy Psychology Religion Sociology Travel Home Religion < Prev CONTENTS Source Next > THE JEUNESSE ETUDIANTE CATHOLIQUE INTERNATIONALE The umbrella organization of this amazing welter of Catholic student organizations rapidly evolving towards the left reflected the multiplicity of approaches and the rapid succession of answers given to the issues at the centre of European student concerns. The history of the Jeunesse Etudiante Catholique Internationale (JECI) remains to be written.[1] Like literally all other international federations of specialized Catholic Action branches, whose archives are readily accessible but which await their historian,[2] the trajectory of the JECI at the highpoint of student struggles in Europe and the world reflects the ups and downs of student movements and their ideological debates in almost perfect laboratory conditions. During the first half of the 1960s, the JECI was in tune with progressive currents in the Catholic church, and the experts invited to their conferences and study sessions hailed from the milieu of theologians representing the currents which helped shape Vatican II. Thus, the summer camp of the university branch of the JECI in Anseremme along the River Meuse in the Walloon Ardennes saw the Belgian-born Dutch reform theologian Edward Schillebeeckx as the central referee.[3] What is worth highlighting, however, is that, already in the early-to-mid-1960s, Spanish theologians were unusually prominent amongst the invited experts, no doubt reflecting the ferment then erupting in the Spanish underground, which cast a bright light over JECI sections in other European states. In 1962, for instance, on the occasion of the 1962 summer camp of the university branches of the JECI in Switzerland, Luis Maldonado, theology professor at a branch campus of the University of Salamanca in Madrid and, in 1962, the chaplain of JEC students at the University of Madrid, introduced the vacationing students to the theology of Karl Rahner.[4] At the European Study Session of the JECI in Folkestone, England, in September 1965, it was the chaplain of the Spanish JEC from 1962 to 1967 and, in 1965, simultaneously the chaplain of the JECI, Jesds Maria Lasagabaster Medinabeitia, who presented his thoughts on ‘The Role of the Christian in the World and the School of Today’ to his audience, basing his reflections on the works of Rahner, Schillebeeckx, and other reform theologians, but also devoting significant space to the theology of Jose Maria Gonzalez Ruiz.[5] If the Iberian dictatorships served to alert European JECI activists to the fragility of democracy, the political and social realities of Latin America contributed to the politicization of the JECI even further. For the JECI was, by definition, not a European but a world association of Catholic students. Latin American students played prominent roles in the JECI from the 1950s onwards. Thus the Brazilian Luis Alberto Gomez do Souza was elected Secretary General of the JECI at the 1958 World Council session in Dakar, Senegal. More importantly, for many crucial years during the wave of radic- alization of student politics, the chaplain of the JECI, headquartered in Paris, was Father Luis de Gonzaga di Sena, formerly an instructor at the priest seminary of Olinda and the University of Recife, forced to leave Brazil as a political exile.[6] Radical ferment had gripped Latin American campuses long before it began to affect most European campuses north of the Pyrenees, and their ideas rapidly gained followers within European sections of the JECI by the late 1960s.[7] The Portuguese delegation to the 1970 London Conference of the JECI, themselves no strangers to bold initiatives, in their internal conference report prominently noted: Of all groups present in London, those who impressed us by far the most were the Latin Americans—and this for various reasons. Apart from being extraordinarily communicative, everyone there felt that their contributions to our gathering were the most precious. They are individuals used to thinking for themselves, full of ideas and questions, capable of always expressing what is on their minds when they have something to say, truly committed to the tasks at hand. One virtually senses how their brains are continuously active, always tackling issues straightforwardly, focusing on the reality of their home countries and the entire world. Their thought processes were continuously stimulated by their confrontation with these realities, always ready to take up the challenge to think for themselves. One could tell that they have a deep-going understanding not only of their own situation but, more generally, of the world situation as such.[8] [1] I intend to address the vagaries of JECI politics in the 1960s and 1970s in a future article.This subchapter of Chapter 4 is merely designed to trace the vague outlines of the turbulencesaffecting the life and times of the JECI in les annees 68.[2] To mention but one goldmine: the archive of the Jeunesse Ouvriere Catholique Internationale (JOCI) in Brussels is extremely well organized and enormously rich—though, thus far,painfully ignored by scholars.[3] Report on the ‘Universitatslager der IKSY’, ‘Anseremme, 30.

Later on assuming the position of chaplain of theJECI, he served in this capacity until 1974; see ‘Merci Sena', in Lettre au Conseil 12 (70-4), March1974—BDIC, JECI, F delta 1980/213. None other than Dom Helder Camara in 1964 becamearchbishop of Olinda and Recife, the home base of Father Sena.[7] A classification of organizations belonging to the JECI, based on an internal questionnaire sent to JECI sections in 1970, which asked for clarification on their preferred strategiesfor social change, clearly shows Latin American sections in the vanguard of radical sentiments,with sections from all other continents clearly trailing behind their Latin American cohortin the degree of commitment to radical solutions; see ‘Rapports de la Session Mondiale dela JECI', ‘Londres 1970': Peter Praetz, ‘Introduction generale', p. 14—BDIC, JECI, F delta1980/46.[8] ‘Informa^ao sobre a sessao mundial e o conselho mundial da JEC Internacional (Londra,23 jul. - 18 ago. 1970)', pp. 10-11—BDIC, JECI, F delta 1980/1062.

161,"Calames Calames Archives de La contemporaine Fonds de collectivités Jeunesse étudiante catholique internationale Description physique : 253 cartons (1113 dossiers) soient 30,36 m.l. Organisme responsable La contemporaine Description : Ce fonds permet notamment d’approcher au plus près le mode d’intervention et d’organisation d’un mouvement de jeunesse d’action catholique dans les différents continents. Il permet également de mesurer l’impact des vicissitudes d’un demi-siècle de relations internationales (Libération, guerre froide, montée du tiers-mondisme, crise économique, chute du mur de Berlin et des communismes d’Etat de l’Europe de l’Est) au sein d’un mouvement d’action catholique spécialisé. L' importance en volume peut tout d’abord s’expliquer par l’abondance de publications : elles représentent environ les deux tiers de ces archives. Ce chiffre ne doit cependant pas minimiser sa richesse qualitative. En effet, les publications composées de périodiques, de bulletins et de brochures relatant les réunions nationales, les sessions internationales et l’activité des membres, sont au contraire le parfait complément des archives des secrétariats et des équipes qui composent les archives de la JECI. Le caractère international du mouvement explique en second lieu le volume du sous-fonds. Depuis 1946, la JECI n’a eu de cesse d’étendre son action sur les 5 continents : ce fonds restitue ainsi l’activité de près de 70 pays membres ou collaborateurs. Classement : Le plan de classement élaboré a épousé dans ses grandes lignes l’organigramme de la JECI depuis sa création. Après une partie statutaire et historique de la JECI, il aborde les Conseils et le Secrétariat Général et leurs activités. L’approche régionale et nationale du mouvement vient clore ce classement. Producteur du fonds ou collectionneur : JECI Biographie ou Histoire : C’est en 1946 que les JEC (Jeunesse étudiante chrétienne), à l’initiative du Canada, de la France et des Etats-Unis, se réunirent à Fribourg (Suisse) pour une Session d’études. Elle regroupait une vingtaine de participants venus essentiellement d’Europe et d’Amérique duNord. Le sens même de cette session était de mettre en commun les efforts faits par les divers mouvements dans leurs pays respectifs au sein du milieu étudiant. A l’issue de cette rencontre, les participants se sont attachés à définir les grandes orientations fondamentales du mouvement dans un texte de base et de poursuivre leurs efforts par la création d’un Centre International de Documentation et d’Information (CIDI) et d’une Commission Internationale. La Commission internationale était responsable de l’orientation du travail international et le CIDI assurait l’exécution du travail et préparait les rencontres internationales. Ces rencontres avaient essentiellement pour dessein de développer chez les JEC nationales une conscienceinternationale et d’engager une réflexion sur le milieu étudiant au lendemain de la guerre. Ainsi, en 1947 la Commission Internationale et le CIDI organisèrent à Pontoise (France), la première session internationale ayant pour thème « Répercussions des manifestations de la vie moderne et des courants de pensée sur la Jeunesse ». Ces sessions suscitèrent un grand intérêt de la part de tous les mouvements catholiques d’Europe et d’Amérique du Nord surtout. Les tensions d’après guerre et l’exclusion des JEC d’Europe de l’Est vont couper net l’essor du CIDI. Plus aucune session internationale ne sera organisée durant les années 1950 à 1954. Cependant, le mouvement va poursuivre ses efforts sur un plan régional et connaître un renouveau lors de la Session de la Commission Internationale de Bruxelles (Belgique) en1954. Conscient des déficiences du CIDI, notamment dans son travail d’expansion du mouvement, les dirigeants jécistes décidèrent qu’il fallait donner une forme nouvelle autravail international de la JEC. En même temps que l’adoption du nom de Jeunesse Etudiante Catholique Internationale (JECI) un texte fut voté : les Bases communes. Déjà en 1946, lorsde la première réunion, les participants avaient dégagé quelques conclusions d’ordre général accepté par les mouvements. En 1954, ces points ont été repris et ils ont permis l’élaboration de ces Bases Communes. En tête du texte on peut lire : « Plus qu’une organisation ou ensemble techniques, elle est esprit de vie ». Ce texte a été réétudié, plusieurs fois notamment à Dakar en 1958 et a donné lieu à la « Charte de Dakar ». Y figurent les orientations générales, les institutions de base de tous les mouvements membres. A l’intérieur de ces lignes générales, chaque mouvement trouve son originalité nationale qui tient compte de chaque situation particulière.La session de Bruxelles marque le début d’une rapide expansion. En 1956, 35 pays étaient en contact avec le Secrétariat Général ; en 1961, il y en avait près d’une soixantaine et plus de130 dans les années 1970. Grâce à un important travail de contacts, les mouvements africains et asiatiques sont venus s’ajouter aux mouvements européens et américains. Malgré des crises internes et financières propres à toute organisation, cette expansion ne se démentira jamais. Modalités d'entrée dans la collection : Don effectué en 1997 par le Germe.

(July 2012) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Created 1929 in France, as part of the Catholic social movement, the JEC was formed by students from the ACJF (Association Catholique de la Jeunesse Française) wishing to minister to other catholic students. The movement organised specialist branches. In 1935 the JEC, opposed Nazism and grew rapidly, in 1936, their first national convention had 4000 participants. JEC movement grew in the spirit of the Specialized Catholic Action movements that were inspired by Joseph Cardijn (the founder of the Young Christian Workers) with the methodology of See-Judge-Act. The JEC was a significant operator in the French resistance during World War II and continued to play a role in French political life until the 1960s. JEC members included numerous members of the resistance, politicians, media and university people, among them: Jacques Delors, Pascal Lamy, Joseph Fontanet, Gilbert Dru, Pierre Alviset, René Rémond, André de Péretti, Patrick Viveret, Pierre Rosanvallon, Geneviève Latreille [fr], Antoine Spire, Jean-Pierre Sueur, Georges Montaron, Christophe Hondelatte, Claude-François Jullien, Roger-Henri Guerrand, Renaud Sainsaulieu, Jean-Marie Vincent, Jean-Yves Le Drian, and Jacques Bugnicourt. Jec Camping Fire, Property of Jec Syria In the 1960s the JEC denounced torture and the French government's fighting against Algerian independence; this caused tensions with the bishops of the Roman Catholic Church in France. As a result, in 1965, the Church removed its mandate from the association. This engagement with the church lead to schism within the JEC, which lasted until the reconstruction in the 1980s. Today[edit] Today the JEC continues its evangelistic mission amongst its members. Their objectives are to make students more aware of their social responsibilities and to help them maintain their faith. The JEC encourages its members to work for social change in their own environment.[1][2] The JEC has a General Consultative Status with the Economic and Social Commission (ECOSOC) of the United Nations, and an Operational Status with UNESCO in 1998. JEC is recognized by the Holy See and since the World Council of Kampala in 2007, has the private juridical statute according to the Canon Law 298-311 and 321-329. Objectives[edit] A. Evangelize student milieu and promote students apostolate, by responding to their specific needs and stressing their responsibility. B. Bring together students seeking community; give them a space for formations and actions in the social vision of the Church at various levels. C. Promote a global solidarity among students and young people for joint reflections and actions leading for a more equitable social order. D. Give students more resources, pedagogic and methodology to integrate their Christian faith to their intellectual and social lives.

It comes on the day (15 May) Nepal is due to make debt payments to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. “We stand in solidarity with our colleagues and the rest of the Nepal in these critical moments. We ask governments, international financial institutions, international banks, and other lenders to do the same by immediately, totally, and unconditionally cancelling the country’s debts,” said Lidy Nacpil, coordinator of the Asian Peoples’ Movement on Debt and Development (APMDD). Nepal’s finance ministry reported that the country owes a total of almost $3.5 billion in external debts as of last October. Just above $3 billion are owed to multilateral banks such as the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank. The country is due to spend $210 million on debt repayments in 2015 alone, more than 5% of government revenue. This includes payments over 2015 of $48 million to the World Bank and $14 million to the IMF. “Already a Least Developed Country, Nepal is pushed back at least by a decade in its development efforts by these devastating earthquakes,” said Dr. Sarba Khadka of Rural Reconstruction Nepal, an APMDD member organization, which endorsed the alliance’s statement. The alliance’s other Nepalese member organizations – mostly rural, human rights, and women’s groups currently providing relief support – supported the call along with movements from other countries. “The advantage of debt cancellation is that it is fast,” said Jonathan Stevenson of the Jubilee Debt Campaign. “Funds are freed up immediately for recovery and reconstruction. Instead, today’s payments will mean millions of dollars are flowing out of Nepal at the time of greatest need. Creditors, starting with the World Bank and Asian Development Bank, should take immediate steps to reverse this.” More than 8,000 people have died and an estimated eight million people have been affected by the first, magnitude-7.8 earthquake which hit Nepal on 25 April. A magnitude-7.3 quake followed on 12 May claiming the lives of at least 76 more. ENDS Notes Jubilee Debt Campaign is a UK-based campaign to break the chains of unjust debt, and for a new financial system that puts people first. The Asian Peoples’ Movement on Debt and Development (formerly Jubilee South–Asia Pacific Movement on Debt and Development) is a regional alliance of peoples’ movements and organizations, coalitions, and non-governmental organizations.

Illicit financial flows continue to strip away potential revenues critical for financing health and social services most needed for our survival, safety, healing and rebuilding.  Tax competition, wide-ranging corporate tax incentives, and barriers to taxation of extractives and digital services remain rife in the region. The escalating race to the bottom in corporate income tax regimes combined with corruption, weak transparency frameworks and regulatory mechanisms have enabled multinational corporations and domestic elites to siphon hundreds of billions out of our countries. SEE MORE Hollow Pillars on Unequal Grounds: How the OECD/G20 Tax Deal Upholds the Inequality and Exclusivity of the Global Tax System On July 10 2021, the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors concluded their third meeting with a resounding endorsement of the unambitious and undemocratic two-pillar solution of the G7 and the OECD. The G20 endorsement is the latest rubber stamp to the agenda dominated and led by the Global North to redefine global tax rules exclusively for their own benefit. While painting the illusion of plugging foregone revenues, the G20 and the OECD’S two-pillar proposal is a false solution that opens more loopholes for tax abuses than it closes. The consequence of the OECD/G20 agreement is strikingly simple – it undermines the calls of peoples from the Global South for a comprehensive, democratic, and just system of global corporate taxation.

This year’s meeting’s supposed objective is “to unite leading democracies to help the world build back better from the COVID-19 pandemic and create a greener, more prosperous future.” SEE MORE Press Release:Asian Movements and Citizens Groups Reject “Inequitable, Undemocratic” 15%  G7 Global Tax Deal As the G7 Finance Ministers’ Meeting in London concluded with exalted acclaim from its member states on the “groundbreaking overhaul” of global tax rules, movements raised alarm bells against the impact of the G7 commitment to a 15% minimum global corporate tax rate.

Statement on the Israeli invasion of Gaza and the Israel-Hamas Truce The Asian Peoples’ Movement on Debt and Development welcomes the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas after 11 days of fierce fighting, the most intense conflict between the two parties since 2014.  The ceasefire provides relief from military violence and better conditions to ensure that humanitarian assistance is delivered to the affected communities. But the roots of the conflict run deep – for so long as the root causes are not addressed,  peace for the people of Palestine remains fragile if not elusive.SEE MORE Following the IFF Trail The report of the High-Level Panel on International Financial Accountability, Transparency and Integrity for Achieving the 2030 Agenda or FACTI Panel underscores the urgent need to address the systemic problem of illicit financial flows (IFF) which, if left unabated, will continue to widen inequalities.

JCF was established in 1991 to provide aid, largely through medical treatment, in areas that were affected by the Chernobyl nuclear disaster of 1986. Since that accident, many children with leukemia and other illnesses have been unable to receive sufficient medical care, due in part to serious economic trouble; many have also died from infectious disease due to poor hygiene. JCF, working closely with doctors in the affected areas, and in cooperation with medical professionals from Shinshu University and other institutions, has been involved in many humanitarian projects. In 2004, JCF expanded its support to include Iraq, a country that has seen a sharp increase in leukemia cases since the Gulf War. Subsequent economic sanctions and armed conflict in that region have led to shortages in medical care and to the loss of life. Loading Wayback Capture Info...

While the group protests nuclear warfare and advocates for the human rights of atomic bomb and nuclear testing victims, its reluctance to support a comprehensive ban on nuclear armament and unwillingness to renounce non-arms use of nuclear energy led to the separation and formation of another organization, Gensuikin, in 1965. Since its founding Gensuikyo has developed many forms of action to achieve three basic goals: 1) the prevention of nuclear war, 2) a ban on and the elimination of nuclear weapons, 3) relief for and solidarity with the Hibakusha, the A-bomb sufferers, through the annual World Conference Against A & H Bombs, which takes place every August, constant and nationwide signature campaigns for a ban on nuclear weapons, and other events and actions in cooperation with the Hibakusha to publicize the damage and health effects of the A-bombings to the general public.

Some ten years later, the Sloth Club still exists and the word “slow” has become widely recognized. Slow can be understood to mean alternative, sustainable, ecological, local, and happy. Slow means “to connect”,"" with other people, with nature, etc. In the last ten years, we have witnessed positive changes all over Japan. The concept of slow has made an impact on many aspects of the society. The movement, for example, encouraged people to start acknowledging the richness of rural life and communities. Many like-minded groups have also formed to address issues as diverse as nuclear disarmament, peace between Japan and Korea, decentralization, and pollution.

Its original mission was to represent the Kansai business community's views on economic revitalization, thereby helping to rebuild Japan's economy, which had been ravaged by the Second World War. Since then, the Kankeiren has contributed greatly to the economic development not only of the Kansai region, but all of Japan, by engaging in a wide range of activities: for instance, promoting such major Kansai-based projects as establishing Kansai International Airport and Kansai Science City; promoting international exchange and interaction primarily in the Asia-Pacific region; and formulating policy proposals to strengthen industrial infrastructures, and encourage the self-reliance and development of local communities. We celebrated our 70th anniversary in 2016, with the number of our members growing to approximately 1,300. The Kansai region is in the midst of a rapidly changing domestic and foreign environment--politically, economically, and technologically, such as through IoT and AI innovations. Under these circumstances, it is essential to pursue sustainable growth by drawing upon Kansai's unique assets, features, and strengths to enhance the appeal of the region. The Kankeiren's new medium-term plan, which began in fiscal 2018, is based on two fundamental points--""Look West"" and ""Kansai as a stage with a global perspective."" Our activities span various key themes--globalism/Asia, culture/tourism, industrial innovation, sports, and regional revitalization--with infrastructure and business foundations as the basis. Through the work of the Kankeiren, we will contribute to achieving the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals: 17 goals and 169 targets adopted at the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit in 2015) that are trending globally. In addition, with the approach of major events such as the 2019 Rugby World Cup, 2020 Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games, and World Masters Games 2021 Kansai, we will be doing our utmost to promote sports, G20 success, and win the bid to host the 2025 World Expo, as cornerstones of future development. At the same time, we will focus on promoting growth fields to support the development of Kansai in the next era, creating bases and ecosystems for the emergence of new ventures and innovation. To see these activities through to fruition, we must hold firmly to the unique perspective that the Kansai region offers, collaborate closely with various stakeholders and organizations to gather expertise, and take the initiative through promotion and action. With a forward-looking view that envisions the future five and ten years down the road, we will work toward the creation of a vibrant Kansai that is full of hope and dreams. Your ongoing understanding and cooperation with our activities is much appreciated.

The organizational score represents the degree to which the organization influencing climate policy and legislation. Corporations also have relationship scores reflecting their links with influencers like trade associations. Both are combined to place the corporation in a performance band. Full details can be found here. close E+ Performance Band 35% Organisation Score 7% Engagement Intensity Engagement Intensity The engagement intensity (EI) is a metric of the extent to which the company is engaging on climate change policy matters, whether positively or negatively. It is a number from 0 (no engagement at all) to 100 (full engagement on all queries/data points). Clearly energy companies are more affected by climate regulations and will have a higher EI than, for example retailers. So an organization’s score should be looked at in conjunction with this metric to gauge the amount of evidence we are using in each case as a basis for scoring. On our scale, an EI of more than 35 indicates a relatively large amount of climate policy engagement. close Modifications to InfluenceMap Scoring Relationship Score, December 2020 A new batch of industry associations has been uploaded onto the InfluenceMap system and the relationship scores recalculated accordingly. Updated terminology, February 2021 We adjusted the terminology used to describe the queries running down the left-hand side of our scoring matrix and added additional explanatory text to the info-boxes.

In 2017, 2018 and 2019, KEF stated on related Government strategies that they do not support carbon tax as it may divert investment away from technological development and increase energy costs. KEF have also opposed emissions trading for the same reasons in 2018 and 2017. In 2019 the chairman of KEF stated opposition to carbon pricing.

187,"influencemap.org Japan Business Federation (Keidanren) Join the InfluenceMap Team Toggle Navigation Home About Projects Lobbying and Corporate Influence Japan Energy Transition Initiative FinanceMap Reports CA100+ Company Profiles Media Methodology FAQ Contact Us Japan Business Federation (Keidanren) InfluenceMap Score What do our scores mean? The organizational score represents the degree to which the organization influencing climate policy and legislation. Corporations also have relationship scores reflecting their links with influencers like trade associations. Both are combined to place the corporation in a performance band. Full details can be found here. close D- Performance Band 41% Organisation Score 38% Engagement Intensity Engagement Intensity The engagement intensity (EI) is a metric of the extent to which the company is engaging on climate change policy matters, whether positively or negatively. It is a number from 0 (no engagement at all) to 100 (full engagement on all queries/data points). Clearly energy companies are more affected by climate regulations and will have a higher EI than, for example retailers. So an organization’s score should be looked at in conjunction with this metric to gauge the amount of evidence we are using in each case as a basis for scoring. On our scale, an EI of more than 35 indicates a relatively large amount of climate policy engagement. close Modifications to InfluenceMap Scoring Relationship Score, December 2020 A new batch of industry associations has been uploaded onto the InfluenceMap system and the relationship scores recalculated accordingly. Updated terminology, February 2021 We adjusted the terminology used to describe the queries running down the left-hand side of our scoring matrix and added additional explanatory text to the info-boxes. This has no impact on the scores and methodology. It has been done following user feedback to improve clarity. close Sector: All Sectors Head​quarters: 東京, 日本 Official Web Site: https://www.keidanren.or.jp/en/ Wikipedia: Japan Business Federation Summary of InfluenceMap Scoring Climate Lobbying Overview: The Japanese Business Federation (Keidanren) has lobbied negatively on most strands of climate change regulation in Japan. This is significant as many Japanese corporations defer their political engagement to trade associations, of which Keidanren is probably the most powerful and influential. Top-line Messaging on Climate Policy: In 2019 through its proposal on Japan’s long term strategy under the Paris Agreement, Keidanren advocated for a voluntary sector action plan with a focus on technological innovation to achieve emission reduction, while in 2018 it appeared to oppose government regulation against climate change in its statement at a MoE committee meeting. In 2021, in a presentation to a METI subcommittee, Keidanren appear to show some support for government regulation but only to set up market-based solutions on climate, calling for general policies including tax support and regulatory reform to promote infrastructure expansion and zero emission energy procurement. In June 2020, Keidanren launched its Challenge Zero initiative, emphasizing the role of voluntary, business-led technology innovation in decarbonization. Despite the ""zero"" in the Challenge Zero initiative, it does not state numerical nor mandatory targets (dates or emissions intensity) for the companies participating. In 2019, Keidanren supported the need for global reduction of greenhouse gases including Japan’s mid-term NDC target to 2030 in its position statement on the electricity system reform. However, in its public consultation response in May 2019 on the long-term growth strategy under Paris agreement, Keidanren appears to oppose the use of a explicit longer term GHG emission target, pushing instead for a “vision”. Media reports (Tokyo Web) in 2019 suggest the organization was influential in advocating this position at a government committee meeting, influencing the outcome of the final strategy. In 2020, through its announcement of the Challenge Zero Initiative, Keidanren appears to generally support the Paris agreement goals including a net zero target, although it does not give a specific timeline, only stating “at the earliest possible date” and through deploying “innovative technologies”. In the same year, Keidanren stated broad support for Japan’s NDC target in its statement on post-corona recovery, however suggesting this should be achieved by voluntary initiatives with government backing and technology innovation. In October 2020, Keidanren’s ex-chairman, Mr. Nakanishi stated support for Japan’s target for carbon neutrality by 2050 in a presentation to the cabinet office. However, he suggested this should be led by innovative technology solutions. Engagement with Climate-Related Regulations: Since opposing the inclusion of an emissions trading scheme in the Ministry of the Environment’s (MoEJ) Plan for Global Warming Countermeasures under the Paris Agreement in 2016, Keidanren has consistently opposed explicit carbon pricing policy and carbon taxes, including at a MoE subcommittee meeting in 2018, in a position statement on the Basic Energy Plan in the same year, and in its 2019 position statement on tax reform. However, in 2021, Keidanren’s ex-chair Mr Nakanishi appears to suggest in a press conference that discussion on carbon price should not be held from the position of assumed energy cost increase, but that tax related to energy should be reorganized to allow positive outcomes for companies, and stated in 2021 that further discussion should take place on how such tax will be utilized. Positioning on Energy Transition: In 2018, Keidanren’s ex=Chairman, Mr. Nakanishi stated that climate change mitigation policy relates directly to energy policy, which requires balanced consideration including economic competitiveness of Japan, and that any measures to increase the cost of energy will disrupt this balance thus should not be implemented. At a MoE committee meeting in 2019, Keidanren appears to disagree that environment should be considered above the economy within the S＋3E of the energy policy. In 2021, in its presentation to METI’s Advisory Committee for Natural Resources and Energy, Keidanren appears to support energy transition with major exceptions that balance of S+3E be maintained. They have advocated for a mix of energy sources including nuclear and thermal coal to ensure low cost and secure supply. Keidanren has remained in favour of a prolonged role for coal in the energy mix, both domestically and across Asia. In 2019, through its public comment submitted to METI on the long-term growth strategy under Paris Agreement, Keidanren explicitly opposed the inclusion of the statement for the abolition or ban on the construction of new coal-fired power plants. Keidanren has traditionally emphasized the financial burden of measures to boost renewable energy, including in its public comment to the 5th Basic Energy Mix proposal in 2018. In 2019, Keidanren appears to show some degree of support towards promoting renewable energy, but on the condition that this fulfils the requirements of “low-cost” and “stable” energy. In 2021, at a METI committee meeting, Keidanren advocated for the continued use of ""high efficiency"" coal power while phasing out older inefficient plants, to support introduction of greater renewable energy and securing a role for nuclear in the energy mix. In February 2021 Keidanren appears to support renewable energy and its introduction as the main power source but states the need for reform to the legislation including review of the FIT system to bring down costs. Through a position statement in 2020 on post-Covid-19 economic recovery, it appears to support decarbonization of the energy system through measures including mainstreaming of renewable energy, although no specific timescale for the transition is given. In April 2021 in response to Japan’s renewed NDC target, the ex-Chairman of Keidanren, Mr. Nakanishi appears to suggest support for an energy transition pathway that includes an increase in renewables and nuclear. He also suggests the need to upgrade the energy grid system, improve energy efficiency through the application of Best Available Technology (BAT), business transition, policy support and ESG investment to realize decarbonization. However, there is some ambiguity regarding the pace and extent of this transition and its alignment with IPCC recommendations. Industry Association Governance: Keidanren appears to have disclosed its board and company memberships as well as about membership (chairs) of committees and working groups. Keidanren has partially disclosed its positions on climate change policies relevant to its operations and has some detailed engagement activities undertaken to influence these policies. It also has a dedicated webpage regarding its climate change positions and direct engagement on climate relevant policy issues. Details of Organization Score What do the 0,1,2 and NSs, NAs mean? Each cell in the organization's matrix presents a chance for us to assess each data source against our column of climate change policy queries. We score from -2 to 2, with negative scores representing evidence of obstructive influence. ""NA"" means ""not applicable"" and ""NS"" means ""not scored"" - that is we did not find any evidence either way. In both cases, the cell's weighting is re-distributed over others. Red and blue cells represent highly interesting negative or positive influence respectively.

Established: August 16, 1946 Authorized as an incorporated association: June 29, 1961 Transition to a general incorporated association: March 30, 2012 Representative Directors: TOKURA Masakazu, Chairman KUBOTA Masakazu, President Directors: 26 Auditors: 2 KEIDANREN is a corporation with an Accounting Auditor. Membership: Corporate members: 1,461 Group members: 156, Special members: 33, Total: 1,650 members (as of April 1, 2021) Secretariat: Staff members: 235 (including temporary staff, as of April 1, 2021) History of KEIDANREN Japan Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren) was established in August 1946, immediately after the end of World War II, with the aim of reconstruction and recovery of the Japanese economy. Keidanren's first Chairman was Ichiro Ishikawa (1946-56). In April 1948, Japan Federation of Employers' Associations (Nikkeiren) was launched with the objective of establishing appropriate relations between labor and management, with the motto ""Employers, Be Righteous and Strong"". Nikkeiren's first Representative Executive Director was Kanichi Moroi (1948-68). Since then, the two organizations have contributed to the development of the Japanese and global economies through maintaining and stimulating a free and open economic model and taking on internal and external challenges that the business community faced, such as liberalization of trade, promotion of free competition, promoting measures for addressing energy and environmental issues, promotion of private sector economic diplomacy, wage negotiations, and establishment of stable labor-management relations. Keidanren's Chairman Taizo Ishizaka (1956-68) emphasized that the business community must take the high road of liberalization, and helped achieve liberalization of capital. In 1966, the original Keidanren Kaikan building was completed, and the organization continued its further development. Keidanren Chairman Toshio Doko (1974-80) used his experience gained through work on the streamlining of factory production to streamline government (administrative reform). Since the tenures of Keidanren Chairman Doko, Nikkeiren Chairman Bunpei Otsuki (1979-87), and Nikkeiren Chairman Eiji Suzuki (1987-91), the major roles of Keidanren and Nikkeiren in contributing to administrative and fiscal reforms have become a common knowledge amongst Japanese public. Japan, although having achieved economic growth, era of trade friction arrived. In order to overcome, succeeding Keidanren introduced concepts such as ""Philosophy of Endurance"" by Keidanren Chairman Yoshihiro Inayama (1980-86); ""Need of Co-existence"" by Keidanren Chairman Gaishi Hiraiwa (1990-94); and ""Attractive Japan"" by Keidanren Chairman Shoichiro Toyoda (1994-98); so that Japanese companies accepted as good corporate citizens in the international society. Amid the trend toward a declining birthrate and an aging population as well as diversification in Japanese peoples' mind sets and values sets, structural reforms of the social security system, labor market, and educational system have become indispensable for enhancing business competitiveness. Therefore, in 2002, Keidanren and Nikkeiren merged to form the Japan Business Federation as a new comprehensive economic organization to address the crosscutting issues. The first Chairman of new Keidanren was Hiroshi Okuda (2002-06). In 2009, the new Keidanren Kaikan building was completed. On March 30, 2012, to comply with changes in legal framework around non-profit organizations, Keidanren changed its legal status from an incorporated association to a general incorporated association. Keidanren has not only worked on the Japanese government to implement its policy proposals on various key issues, but also has released comprehensive and long-term development strategies for Japan at home and abroad. The chairman vision statements broadly presented the future image of the Japanese economy and the society as well: ""Envisioning a Vibrant and Attractive Japan"" (Chairman Okuda, 2003), ""Land of Hope, Japan"" (Chairman Mitarai, 2007), and ""Toward the Creation of a More Affluent and Vibrant Japan"" (Chairman Sakakibara, 2015). The ""Sunrise Report"" (Chairman Yonekura, 2010) declared the setting-up and promotion of business-led projects to enhance industrial strength. Ever since Chairman Okuda became a private-sector member of the Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy (chaired by Prime Minister Koizumi at the time), Keidanren's Chairmen have been private-sector members at important government meetings to participate in government policy discussions in a wide range of fields, including economy, government finance, industry, and science and technology. Contributions made by Chairman Sadayuki Sakakibara (2014-2018) at meetings such as the Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy, the Council on Investments for the Future, and the Council for Designing 100-Year Life Society, recommendations made by Keidanren have been reflected in the Japan Revitalization Strategy and other initiatives of the Abe Cabinet. As Japanese companies engage in business activities on a global scale, Keidanren's activities are also expanding from domestic to the global stage.

Keio University (慶應義塾大学, Keiō Gijuku Daigaku), abbreviated as Keio (慶應) or Keidai (慶大), is a private research university located in Minato, Tokyo, Japan. It is the oldest institute of western higher education in Japan. Its founder, Fukuzawa Yukichi, originally established it as a school for Western studies in 1858 in Edo. The university has eleven campuses in Tokyo and Kanagawa. It has ten undergraduate faculties: Letters, Economics, Law, Business and Commerce, Medicine, Science and Technology, Policy Management, Environment and Information Studies, Nursing and Medical Care, and Pharmacy. There are fourteen graduate schools (listed below) and both on- and off-campus research institutes and facilities. The university is one of the members of Top Global University Project, funded by the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology.[4] Keio University is also one of the member universities of RU11[5] and APRU, and it is one of only two Japanese universities (alongside the University of Tokyo) to be a member of the World Economic Forum's Global University Leaders Forum.[6] Its list of alumni and faculties includes three former prime ministers,[7] two astronauts,[7] six international honorary members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a Wolf Prize winner. Keio University also produced the largest number of CEOs of companies listed in the first section of Tokyo Stock Exchange[7][8] and ranks 53rd (in the world) in top 100 Global Executives, according to Times Higher Education's ""Alma Master Index 2017"".[9] Contents 1 Overview 1.1 Mission 1.2 Academic culture 1.2.1 Japanese modern education system contributions 1.2.2 Dokuritsu Jison 1.2.3 Hangaku Hankyo 1.2.4 Shachu no Kyoryoku 2 History 3 Presidents 4 Student body 5 Student life 5.1 Societies 5.2 Festivals 5.3 Athletics 5.3.1 Association football 5.3.2 Kei-So rivalry 5.3.3 American football 5.4 Scandals 6 Academic rankings 6.1 Research performance 6.1.1 Business 6.1.2 Accounting 6.1.3 Medicine 6.1.4 Law 6.2 Popularity and selectivity 7 Evaluation from Business World 8 Finance 8.1 Tuition fees 8.2 Scholarship/loan 9 Organization 9.1 Faculties 9.2 Graduate schools 9.3 Media centers 9.4 Information technology centers 9.5 Affiliated schools 9.6 Hospital and rehabilitation center 10 Campuses 11 Alumni and professors 11.1 Politicians 11.2 Public servants, international organizations 11.3 Central Bank Governors 11.4 Astronauts 11.5 Finance 11.6 Media 11.7 Other business people 11.8 Academia 11.9 Art 11.10 Others 12 Gutenberg Bible 13 Bibliography 14 Notes 15 References 16 See also 17 External links Overview[edit] The founder of Keio Fukuzawa Yukichi's statue on Hiyoshi campus. East Research Building in Mita Keio traces its history to 1858 when Fukuzawa Yukichi, who had studied the Western educational system at Brown University in the United States, started to teach Dutch while he was a guest of the Okudaira family. In 1868 he changed the name of the school to Keio Gijuku and devoted all his time to education. While Keio's initial identity was that of a private school of Western studies, it expanded and established its first university faculty in 1890, and became known as a leading institute in Japanese higher education. It was the first Japanese university to reach its 150th anniversary, celebrating this anniversary in 2008. Keio has leading research centers. It has approximately 30 Research Centers located on its five main campuses and at other facilities for advanced research in Japan.[10] Keio University Research Institute at SFC (KRIS) has joined the MIT and the French INRIA in hosting the international W3C.[11] Mission[edit] In his speech at an alumni gathering on November 1, 1896, Fukuzawa stated the mission of Keio as follows: Keio Gijuku shouldn't be satisfied with being just one educational institution. Its mission is expected to be a model of the nobility of intelligence and virtue, to make clear how it can be applied to its family, society, and nation, and to take an actual action of this statement. It expects all students being leaders in society by the practice of this mission. Those sentences were given to students as his will, and considered as the simple expression of Keio's actual mission.[12] Academic culture[edit] Japanese modern education system contributions[edit] Keio is known for being the first institution to introduce many modern education practices in Japan: Keio is the earliest Japanese school that introduced an annual fixed course fee, designed by Fukuzawa.[note 2] It initially introduced the culture of speech to Japan, which Japan had never had before. It built Japan's earliest speech house Mita Speech House in 1875 as well.[13] It is regarded as Japan's first university to accept international students.[14] Keio accepted 2 Korean students in 1881 as its (and also Japan's) first international students. 60 Korean students entered in 1883 and 130 Korean students in 1895. Dokuritsu Jison[edit] Keio put ""Independence and self-respect (独立自尊, Dokuritsu Jison)"" as a foundation of its education. This is meant to be physically and mentally independent, and respect yourself for keeping your virtue.[15] Independence and self-respect are also regarded as Fukuzawa's nature and essence of his education.[16] Hangaku Hankyo[edit] Learning half and teaching half (半学半教, Hangaku Hankyo) is the other unique culture at Keio.[17] During the late Edo period and the early Meiji period, several private prep schools often used students as assistant teachers and it was called ""Learning half and teaching half"". Keio also had initially used this system. In the early period of such schools of Western studies, there had been many things to learn not only for students but also professors themselves. Hence there had been occasions when students who had learned in advance had taught other students and even professors. After the proper legal systems for education had been set up, those situations disappeared. However, Fukuzawa thought the essence of academia was and is a continuous learning process, and that more knowledge provided more learning opportunities. Keio respects his thought and established the rule ""Rules in Keio Gijuku (慶應義塾社中之約束, Keio Gijuku Shachu no Yakusoku)"", which states that there shouldn't be any hierarchy between teachers and learners, and that all of the people in Keio Gijuku are in the same company. For this reason, there is still a culture at Keio that all professors and lecturers are officially called with the honorific of ""Kun"" but never ""Teacher"" or ""Professor"".[18][19] Shachu no Kyoryoku[edit] Collaboration in a company (社中の協力, Shachu no Kyoryoku) is also a uniqueness of Keio.[20] Fukuzawa stated in 1879 that the Keio's success today is because of the collaboration in its company, and ""Collaboration in a company"" originally came from this article. People in Keio often think that all of the people related to Keio (e.g. professors, students, alumni and their family members) are the part of their company, thus they should try to help each other like brothers and sisters. This culture has been often seen especially in the alumni organization called Mita-Kai.[21] History[edit] Keio Gijuku in Tsukiji in 1862 Keio University in May 1912 Keio University (慶應義塾大学, Keiō Gijuku Daigaku) was established in 1858 as a School of Western studies located in one of the mansion houses in Tsukiji by the founder Fukuzawa Yukichi.[22] Its root is considered as the Han school for Kokugaku studies named Shinshu Kan established in 1796.[23] Keio changed its name as ""Keio Gijuku"" in 1868, which came from the era name ""Keio""[24] and ""Gijuku"" as the translation of Private school.[25] It moved to the current location in 1871, established the Medical school in 1873, and the official university department with Economics, Law and Literacy study in 1890.[26] Year University development 1858 Establishment of Keio Gijuku 1879 Keio rejected an offer to become a national university.[27]Instead of that, it became a vocational school funded by daimyōs including Shimazu clan. 1890 Departments of Economics, Law, and Letters established 1906 Graduate studies programs established 1917 School of Medicine established 1920 Keio authorized as a university in the prewar system 1944 School of Technology established 1949 Keio authorized as a university in the post-war system 1957 School of Business and Commerce established 1962 Graduate School of Business Administration established 1981 Department of Science and Technology established 1990 School of Environmental and Information Studies and School of Policy Management established 2001 School of Nursing and Medical Care established 2004 School of Law established 2008 School of Pharmacy established 2008 Graduate School of Media Design established Some other notable events in Keio's history: In 1886, Keio named Hiromoto Watanabe as the first chancellor of the Imperial University (University of Tokyo). He was the first chancellor of an officially authorized university in Japan. In 1899, Keio sent 6 students to study abroad. In the same year, it accepted three international students from India, Qing-dynasty China, and Thailand. Eight international students entered from Taiwan (which had technically been a territory of the Japanese Empire since 1895) in the following year. Keio was visited by Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore in 1916. In 1922, Keio was visited by Albert Einstein, who presented a special lecture on the theory of relativity.[28] In 1946, Keio began accepting female students. In 2006, a paper with a Keio undergraduate student as its first listed author was published in the research journal Science.[29][30] In 2008, Keio was visited by Prince Charles. Presidents[edit] Since the president system was established in 1881, Keio has had 18 presidents.[31] President Tenure President Tenure President Tenure President Tenure 1.

Although two-thirds of the student body are males, this ratio highly depends on the major (63% of students are female in the Faculty of Letters, for instance).[3] There are 1072 international students in May 2011, with 438 undergraduate students (1.5% of total undergraduate students), 480 graduate students (9.8% of total graduate students) and 90 students in the exchange program.[32] Korea is the country which provides the most international students with 381, followed by China (300), Taiwan (57), France (42), Indonesia (27), USA (27) and Germany (22).[32] Student life[edit] Mita Sai Societies[edit] In Japanese universities, there are student societies called ""circles"". Although the exact number is not clear, there are over 410 circles in Keio.[33] Festivals[edit] Keio holds school festivals every year on each campus. The main festival is called ""Mita Sai"" and is usually held on Mita campus in late November.[34] Mita Sai includes various academic and recreational activities and also serves as a research workshop for students on Mita campus.[35] Approximately 200,000 people visit Mita Sai every year.[36] Athletics[edit] Edward Bramwell Clarke and Tanaka Ginnosuke first introduced Rugby union to Japanese students at Keio University. The game had been played in the treaty ports of Yokohama and Kobe before that, but not between Japanese teams. The interest of Keio's students in baseball stretches back to the early years of the 20th century. In 1913, an American touring team of players from the New York Giants and the Chicago White Sox played an exhibition game against the Keio team.[37] In a 1932 exhibition game, the Keio team beat the University of Michigan team, which was then touring Japan.[38] Keio's baseball team plays in the Tokyo Big6 Baseball League (six prominent universities in the Tokyo area). Association football[edit] Keio University's association football (soccer) team is the most successful team in the history of the Emperor's Cup, although their last triumph was in 1956. They have won nine times, a number no professional team has ever achieved in the tournament. Kei-So rivalry[edit] Kei-So Sen Traditionally, there has been a strong rivalry between Keio and Waseda University. There are annually many matches between the two universities in several sports, such as baseball, rowing and rugby. These games are called ""Kei–So Sen (慶早戦)"", or more generally ""So–Kei Sen (早慶戦)"". The Kei-So baseball rivalry, which dates back more than a century, is especially famous because of its importance in Japanese baseball history. The most famous Kei-So baseball game, which was played on October 16, 1943, was made into a movie titled ""The Last Game – the Final So-Kei Sen -"" in 2008. There are two Kei-So baseball games every year, and they are usually broadcast by NHK. There is no lecture on all campuses in Keio on the game day because of the students who want to watch this match. Kei-So baseball games were even visited by Japanese emperors in 1929, 1950 and 1994. Keio University is one of the most prestigious universities in Japan. Times Higher Education estimates that Keio is 351–400th place in general academic rankings among world universities. American football[edit] Main article: Keio Unicorns football Scandals[edit] In October 2016, six male students from Keio Advertisement Society, a long-standing student club famous for its organisation of the Miss Keio pageant contest, were investigated for gang rape during a club activity.[39] An out-of-court settlement was reached and the students were not prosecuted.[40] In May 2018, another three students were arrested for sexual assaults.[41] In March 2017, a student tennis club was disbanded after a student died of alcohol poisoning during a club activity. Two other Keio students had died due to over-drinking in 2012 and 2013.[42] In June 2017, the school's election committee unconventionally selected Haseyama Akira, a legal history professor who only won second place at the general election amongst teachers and staffs, to be the school's new president, breaking a 50-year convention.[43] In late 2019, both the American football team and the cheerleading club suspended club activities for ""inappropriate behaviours"".[44][45] In January 2020, it was reported that a former member of the school president's secretarial staff had installed camera in a female toilet stall on Mita campus, filming over a thousand videos over 3 months.[46][47] Academic rankings[edit] University rankingsToyo Keizai National[48] General 2Kawaijuku [ja] National[49] General 6T.

In fact, there have been 4 presidents of Japan Medical Association related to this university (2 Alumni and 2 professors).[note 3] This number is the 2nd largest among Japanese medical schools.[85] Keio is one of 2 Japanese universities which provided a president of World Medical Association.[86] Law[edit] Keio's law faculty is typically ranked among the best in all of Japan along with the University of Tokyo, University of Kyoto, Chuo University, and Hitotsubashi University. In 2010 and 2015, Keio University Law School ranked highest among all Japanese universities for Bar Exam passage rate.[87] Furthermore, the number of Members of Parliament who graduated Keio has been 3rd in Japan.[74][88] Popularity and selectivity[edit] Keio is a popular university in Japan, often considered one of Japan's top two private universities alongside their rival, Waseda University. The number of applicants per place was 11.7 (48260/4098) in 2011 undergraduate admissions.[89] Its entrance difficulty is usually considered as top with Waseda among 730 private universities.[note 4][note 5][note 6] Nikkei BP has been publishing a ranking system called ""Brand rankings of Japanese universities"" every year, composed by the various indications related to the power of brand, in which Keio was top in 2014, and ranked second in 2015 and 2016 in Greater Tokyo Area.[90] Webometrics (2008) also ranks Keio University as 3rd in Japan, 11th in Asia, and 208th in the world for quantity and quality of web presence and link visibility.[91] In a unique ranking, TBS ranked Japanese universities by the questionnaire of ""Which university student do you want to have as your boyfriend?"" to 300 girls in Shibuya, and Keio was ranked 1st in this ranking.[note 7] Evaluation from Business World[edit] The university ranking of the ratio of ""president and chief executive officer of listed company"" in Japan Ranking all universities in Japan 3rd[92] out of all the 744[93] universities which existed as of 2006 Source 2006 Survey[92] by Weekly Diamond 〈ja〉 on the ranking of the universities which produced the high ratio of the graduates who hold the position of ""president and chief executive officer of listed company"" to all the graduates of each university The university ranking according to the ratio of the number of the officers & managers produced by each university to the number of graduates Ranking all universities in Japan 26th[94] out of all the 778[95] universities which existed as of 2010 Source 2010 Survey by Weekly Economist 〈ja〉 on the ranking of universities according to the ratio of the number of the officers & managers produced by each university to the number of graduates The university ranking according to the order of the evaluation by Personnel Departments of Leading Companies in Japan Ranking Japan 15th[96] (out of 781[97]　universities in Japan as of 2020) Source 2020 Nikkei Survey[98] to all listed (3,714[99]) and leading unlisted (1,100), totally 4,814 companies[98] Finance[edit] Operating revenues/expenses in 2010[100] Revenues (yen in millions) ratio Expenses (yen in millions) ratio Tuition and fees 49,204 24.97% Compensation and benefits 65,270 33.12% Investment return 4,170 2.12% Education & Research 52,148 26.46% Capital gain 20,817 10.56% Investment 32,923 16.71% National appropriation/Grants (Direct) 17,082 8.67% Repayment of debt 13,236 6.72% Medical care 48,274 24.50% Debt loan 11,680 5.93% Endowments 5,475 2.78% Total 197,061 100.00% Total 197,061 100.00% According to Keio's financial report, there was operating revenue of 197 billion yen in 2010.[100] The top three largest incomes were from ""tuition and fees"", ""medical care"" and ""capital gain"", with 49 billion yen, 48 billion yen and 21 billion yen respectively.

Keio was established by the fund of Tokugawa shogunate, so it was hard to work for the new government in this sense. Fukuzawa in fact criticized severely Kaishū Katsu and Takeaki Enomoto who worked for both Tokugawa and the new government (see Fukuzawa Yukichi). His such strict viewpoint had prevented Keio to set up a political department, and kept many Keio graduate away from politics for a long time.

Keio University also produced the largest number of CEOs of companies listed in the first section of Tokyo Stock Exchange[7][8] and ranks 53rd (in the world) in top 100 Global Executives, according to Times Higher Education's ""Alma Master Index 2017"".[9] Contents 1 Overview 1.1 Mission 1.2 Academic culture 1.2.1 Japanese modern education system contributions 1.2.2 Dokuritsu Jison 1.2.3 Hangaku Hankyo 1.2.4 Shachu no Kyoryoku 2 History 3 Presidents 4 Student body 5 Student life 5.1 Societies 5.2 Festivals 5.3 Athletics 5.3.1 Association football 5.3.2 Kei-So rivalry 5.3.3 American football 5.4 Scandals 6 Academic rankings 6.1 Research performance 6.1.1 Business 6.1.2 Accounting 6.1.3 Medicine 6.1.4 Law 6.2 Popularity and selectivity 7 Evaluation from Business World 8 Finance 8.1 Tuition fees 8.2 Scholarship/loan 9 Organization 9.1 Faculties 9.2 Graduate schools 9.3 Media centers 9.4 Information technology centers 9.5 Affiliated schools 9.6 Hospital and rehabilitation center 10 Campuses 11 Alumni and professors 11.1 Politicians 11.2 Public servants, international organizations 11.3 Central Bank Governors 11.4 Astronauts 11.5 Finance 11.6 Media 11.7 Other business people 11.8 Academia 11.9 Art 11.10 Others 12 Gutenberg Bible 13 Bibliography 14 Notes 15 References 16 See also 17 External links Overview[edit] The founder of Keio Fukuzawa Yukichi's statue on Hiyoshi campus. East Research Building in Mita Keio traces its history to 1858 when Fukuzawa Yukichi, who had studied the Western educational system at Brown University in the United States, started to teach Dutch while he was a guest of the Okudaira family. In 1868 he changed the name of the school to Keio Gijuku and devoted all his time to education. While Keio's initial identity was that of a private school of Western studies, it expanded and established its first university faculty in 1890, and became known as a leading institute in Japanese higher education. It was the first Japanese university to reach its 150th anniversary, celebrating this anniversary in 2008. Keio has leading research centers. It has approximately 30 Research Centers located on its five main campuses and at other facilities for advanced research in Japan.[10] Keio University Research Institute at SFC (KRIS) has joined the MIT and the French INRIA in hosting the international W3C.[11] Mission[edit] In his speech at an alumni gathering on November 1, 1896, Fukuzawa stated the mission of Keio as follows: Keio Gijuku shouldn't be satisfied with being just one educational institution. Its mission is expected to be a model of the nobility of intelligence and virtue, to make clear how it can be applied to its family, society, and nation, and to take an actual action of this statement. It expects all students being leaders in society by the practice of this mission. Those sentences were given to students as his will, and considered as the simple expression of Keio's actual mission.[12] Academic culture[edit] Japanese modern education system contributions[edit] Keio is known for being the first institution to introduce many modern education practices in Japan: Keio is the earliest Japanese school that introduced an annual fixed course fee, designed by Fukuzawa.[note 2] It initially introduced the culture of speech to Japan, which Japan had never had before. It built Japan's earliest speech house Mita Speech House in 1875 as well.[13] It is regarded as Japan's first university to accept international students.[14] Keio accepted 2 Korean students in 1881 as its (and also Japan's) first international students. 60 Korean students entered in 1883 and 130 Korean students in 1895. Dokuritsu Jison[edit] Keio put ""Independence and self-respect (独立自尊, Dokuritsu Jison)"" as a foundation of its education. This is meant to be physically and mentally independent, and respect yourself for keeping your virtue.[15] Independence and self-respect are also regarded as Fukuzawa's nature and essence of his education.[16] Hangaku Hankyo[edit] Learning half and teaching half (半学半教, Hangaku Hankyo) is the other unique culture at Keio.[17] During the late Edo period and the early Meiji period, several private prep schools often used students as assistant teachers and it was called ""Learning half and teaching half"". Keio also had initially used this system. In the early period of such schools of Western studies, there had been many things to learn not only for students but also professors themselves. Hence there had been occasions when students who had learned in advance had taught other students and even professors. After the proper legal systems for education had been set up, those situations disappeared. However, Fukuzawa thought the essence of academia was and is a continuous learning process, and that more knowledge provided more learning opportunities. Keio respects his thought and established the rule ""Rules in Keio Gijuku (慶應義塾社中之約束, Keio Gijuku Shachu no Yakusoku)"", which states that there shouldn't be any hierarchy between teachers and learners, and that all of the people in Keio Gijuku are in the same company. For this reason, there is still a culture at Keio that all professors and lecturers are officially called with the honorific of ""Kun"" but never ""Teacher"" or ""Professor"".[18][19] Shachu no Kyoryoku[edit] Collaboration in a company (社中の協力, Shachu no Kyoryoku) is also a uniqueness of Keio.[20] Fukuzawa stated in 1879 that the Keio's success today is because of the collaboration in its company, and ""Collaboration in a company"" originally came from this article. People in Keio often think that all of the people related to Keio (e.g. professors, students, alumni and their family members) are the part of their company, thus they should try to help each other like brothers and sisters. This culture has been often seen especially in the alumni organization called Mita-Kai.[21] History[edit] Keio Gijuku in Tsukiji in 1862 Keio University in May 1912 Keio University (慶應義塾大学, Keiō Gijuku Daigaku) was established in 1858 as a School of Western studies located in one of the mansion houses in Tsukiji by the founder Fukuzawa Yukichi.[22] Its root is considered as the Han school for Kokugaku studies named Shinshu Kan established in 1796.[23] Keio changed its name as ""Keio Gijuku"" in 1868, which came from the era name ""Keio""[24] and ""Gijuku"" as the translation of Private school.[25] It moved to the current location in 1871, established the Medical school in 1873, and the official university department with Economics, Law and Literacy study in 1890.[26] Year University development 1858 Establishment of Keio Gijuku 1879 Keio rejected an offer to become a national university.[27]Instead of that, it became a vocational school funded by daimyōs including Shimazu clan. 1890 Departments of Economics, Law, and Letters established 1906 Graduate studies programs established 1917 School of Medicine established 1920 Keio authorized as a university in the prewar system 1944 School of Technology established 1949 Keio authorized as a university in the post-war system 1957 School of Business and Commerce established 1962 Graduate School of Business Administration established 1981 Department of Science and Technology established 1990 School of Environmental and Information Studies and School of Policy Management established 2001 School of Nursing and Medical Care established 2004 School of Law established 2008 School of Pharmacy established 2008 Graduate School of Media Design established Some other notable events in Keio's history: In 1886, Keio named Hiromoto Watanabe as the first chancellor of the Imperial University (University of Tokyo). He was the first chancellor of an officially authorized university in Japan. In 1899, Keio sent 6 students to study abroad. In the same year, it accepted three international students from India, Qing-dynasty China, and Thailand. Eight international students entered from Taiwan (which had technically been a territory of the Japanese Empire since 1895) in the following year. Keio was visited by Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore in 1916. In 1922, Keio was visited by Albert Einstein, who presented a special lecture on the theory of relativity.[28] In 1946, Keio began accepting female students. In 2006, a paper with a Keio undergraduate student as its first listed author was published in the research journal Science.[29][30] In 2008, Keio was visited by Prince Charles. Presidents[edit] Since the president system was established in 1881, Keio has had 18 presidents.[31] President Tenure President Tenure President Tenure President Tenure 1.

Atsushi Seike 2009– 2017 Student body[edit] Demographics of student body in 2011[3][32] Undergraduate Graduate (Master) Graduate (Doctor) Professional Total Total 28,931 3,115 1,234 545 33,825 Male 19,557 2,281 864 344 23,046 Female 9,374 834 370 201 10,779 International 438 480 918 In 2011, there are 33,825 students in Keio University, with 28,931 undergraduate students and 4,894 graduate students. Although two-thirds of the student body are males, this ratio highly depends on the major (63% of students are female in the Faculty of Letters, for instance).[3] There are 1072 international students in May 2011, with 438 undergraduate students (1.5% of total undergraduate students), 480 graduate students (9.8% of total graduate students) and 90 students in the exchange program.[32] Korea is the country which provides the most international students with 381, followed by China (300), Taiwan (57), France (42), Indonesia (27), USA (27) and Germany (22).[32] Student life[edit] Mita Sai Societies[edit] In Japanese universities, there are student societies called ""circles"". Although the exact number is not clear, there are over 410 circles in Keio.[33] Festivals[edit] Keio holds school festivals every year on each campus. The main festival is called ""Mita Sai"" and is usually held on Mita campus in late November.[34] Mita Sai includes various academic and recreational activities and also serves as a research workshop for students on Mita campus.[35] Approximately 200,000 people visit Mita Sai every year.[36] Athletics[edit] Edward Bramwell Clarke and Tanaka Ginnosuke first introduced Rugby union to Japanese students at Keio University. The game had been played in the treaty ports of Yokohama and Kobe before that, but not between Japanese teams. The interest of Keio's students in baseball stretches back to the early years of the 20th century. In 1913, an American touring team of players from the New York Giants and the Chicago White Sox played an exhibition game against the Keio team.[37] In a 1932 exhibition game, the Keio team beat the University of Michigan team, which was then touring Japan.[38] Keio's baseball team plays in the Tokyo Big6 Baseball League (six prominent universities in the Tokyo area). Association football[edit] Keio University's association football (soccer) team is the most successful team in the history of the Emperor's Cup, although their last triumph was in 1956. They have won nine times, a number no professional team has ever achieved in the tournament. Kei-So rivalry[edit] Kei-So Sen Traditionally, there has been a strong rivalry between Keio and Waseda University. There are annually many matches between the two universities in several sports, such as baseball, rowing and rugby. These games are called ""Kei–So Sen (慶早戦)"", or more generally ""So–Kei Sen (早慶戦)"". The Kei-So baseball rivalry, which dates back more than a century, is especially famous because of its importance in Japanese baseball history. The most famous Kei-So baseball game, which was played on October 16, 1943, was made into a movie titled ""The Last Game – the Final So-Kei Sen -"" in 2008. There are two Kei-So baseball games every year, and they are usually broadcast by NHK. There is no lecture on all campuses in Keio on the game day because of the students who want to watch this match. Kei-So baseball games were even visited by Japanese emperors in 1929, 1950 and 1994. Keio University is one of the most prestigious universities in Japan. Times Higher Education estimates that Keio is 351–400th place in general academic rankings among world universities. American football[edit] Main article: Keio Unicorns football Scandals[edit] In October 2016, six male students from Keio Advertisement Society, a long-standing student club famous for its organisation of the Miss Keio pageant contest, were investigated for gang rape during a club activity.[39] An out-of-court settlement was reached and the students were not prosecuted.[40] In May 2018, another three students were arrested for sexual assaults.[41] In March 2017, a student tennis club was disbanded after a student died of alcohol poisoning during a club activity. Two other Keio students had died due to over-drinking in 2012 and 2013.[42] In June 2017, the school's election committee unconventionally selected Haseyama Akira, a legal history professor who only won second place at the general election amongst teachers and staffs, to be the school's new president, breaking a 50-year convention.[43] In late 2019, both the American football team and the cheerleading club suspended club activities for ""inappropriate behaviours"".[44][45] In January 2020, it was reported that a former member of the school president's secretarial staff had installed camera in a female toilet stall on Mita campus, filming over a thousand videos over 3 months.[46][47] Academic rankings[edit] University rankingsToyo Keizai National[48] General 2Kawaijuku [ja] National[49] General 6T.

Research performance[edit] According to Thomson Reuters, Keio is the 10th best research university in Japan, and it is the only private university within Top 15.[50] In addition, Weekly Diamond reported that Keio has the 8th highest research standard in Japan in terms of research fundings per researchers in COE Program, and it is also the only private university within Top 10.[73] The Asahi Shimbun summarized the number of academic papers in Japanese major legal journals by university, and Keio was ranked 2nd during 2005–2009.[60] Accordingly, Keio is a prominent research university within Japan. In economics, according to The Asahi Shimbun, Keio's been ranked 7th in Japan in the economic research ranking during 2005–2009.[74] More recently, Repec in January 2011 ranked Keio's Economic department as Japan's 6th best economic research university.[75] Keio has provided 3 presidents of Japanese Economic Association in its 42-year history, and this number is 5th largest.[76] In addition, Nikkei Shimbun on 2004/2/16 surveyed about the research standards in Engineering studies based on Thomson Reuters, Grants in Aid for Scientific Research and questionnaires to heads of 93 leading Japanese Research Centers, and Keio was placed 8th (research planning ability 4th/informative ability of research outcome 3rd) in this ranking.[77] Business[edit] Keio ranks second in Japan, for the number of alumni holding CEO positions in Fortune Global 500 companies, according to Mines ParisTech: Professional Ranking of World Universities.[59] Keio is also ranked 1st in Japan for the number of alumni generally holding executive positions (when positions like COO, CFO, CIO etc. are included along with the CEO position) in listed companies of Japan, and this number per student (probability of becoming an executive) is also top.[78][79] Keio Business School is Japan's first business school and one of four Japanese schools holding The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) accreditation.[80] Keio was ranked No. 1 in Japan by Nikkei Shimbun.[81] Eduniversal also ranked Keio as top in Japan (75th in the world).[82] In Eduniversal Keio is one of only 3 Japanese schools categorized in ""Universal Business schools with major international influence"". In 2012, the Keio Business School became founding member of the university alliance Council on Business & Society that consists of Tuck School of Business from USA, University of Mannheim Business School from Germany, ESSEC Business School from France, Fudan University from China, Fundação Getúlio Vargas from Brazil and Keio Business School. According to the Weekly Economist's 2010 rankings and the PRESIDENT's article on 16 October 2006, graduates from Keio University have the 3rd best employment rate in 400 major companies, and the alumni's average salary is the 3rd best in Japan.[83][84] Accounting[edit] As an extension of Keio's strong business focus, for over 30 years, Keio graduates have been ranked first in Japan in the number of successful national CPA exam applicants.[10] Medicine[edit] Keio has been influential in Japanese medical societies as well. In fact, there have been 4 presidents of Japan Medical Association related to this university (2 Alumni and 2 professors).[note 3] This number is the 2nd largest among Japanese medical schools.[85] Keio is one of 2 Japanese universities which provided a president of World Medical Association.[86] Law[edit] Keio's law faculty is typically ranked among the best in all of Japan along with the University of Tokyo, University of Kyoto, Chuo University, and Hitotsubashi University. In 2010 and 2015, Keio University Law School ranked highest among all Japanese universities for Bar Exam passage rate.[87] Furthermore, the number of Members of Parliament who graduated Keio has been 3rd in Japan.[74][88] Popularity and selectivity[edit] Keio is a popular university in Japan, often considered one of Japan's top two private universities alongside their rival, Waseda University. The number of applicants per place was 11.7 (48260/4098) in 2011 undergraduate admissions.[89] Its entrance difficulty is usually considered as top with Waseda among 730 private universities.[note 4][note 5][note 6] Nikkei BP has been publishing a ranking system called ""Brand rankings of Japanese universities"" every year, composed by the various indications related to the power of brand, in which Keio was top in 2014, and ranked second in 2015 and 2016 in Greater Tokyo Area.[90] Webometrics (2008) also ranks Keio University as 3rd in Japan, 11th in Asia, and 208th in the world for quantity and quality of web presence and link visibility.[91] In a unique ranking, TBS ranked Japanese universities by the questionnaire of ""Which university student do you want to have as your boyfriend?"" to 300 girls in Shibuya, and Keio was ranked 1st in this ranking.[note 7] Evaluation from Business World[edit] The university ranking of the ratio of ""president and chief executive officer of listed company"" in Japan Ranking all universities in Japan 3rd[92] out of all the 744[93] universities which existed as of 2006 Source 2006 Survey[92] by Weekly Diamond 〈ja〉 on the ranking of the universities which produced the high ratio of the graduates who hold the position of ""president and chief executive officer of listed company"" to all the graduates of each university The university ranking according to the ratio of the number of the officers & managers produced by each university to the number of graduates Ranking all universities in Japan 26th[94] out of all the 778[95] universities which existed as of 2010 Source 2010 Survey by Weekly Economist 〈ja〉 on the ranking of universities according to the ratio of the number of the officers & managers produced by each university to the number of graduates The university ranking according to the order of the evaluation by Personnel Departments of Leading Companies in Japan Ranking Japan 15th[96] (out of 781[97]　universities in Japan as of 2020) Source 2020 Nikkei Survey[98] to all listed (3,714[99]) and leading unlisted (1,100), totally 4,814 companies[98] Finance[edit] Operating revenues/expenses in 2010[100] Revenues (yen in millions) ratio Expenses (yen in millions) ratio Tuition and fees 49,204 24.97% Compensation and benefits 65,270 33.12% Investment return 4,170 2.12% Education & Research 52,148 26.46% Capital gain 20,817 10.56% Investment 32,923 16.71% National appropriation/Grants (Direct) 17,082 8.67% Repayment of debt 13,236 6.72% Medical care 48,274 24.50% Debt loan 11,680 5.93% Endowments 5,475 2.78% Total 197,061 100.00% Total 197,061 100.00% According to Keio's financial report, there was operating revenue of 197 billion yen in 2010.[100] The top three largest incomes were from ""tuition and fees"", ""medical care"" and ""capital gain"", with 49 billion yen, 48 billion yen and 21 billion yen respectively.

In most Japanese universities, there are more payment requirements in the first year such as ""entrance fees"", and less in the rest of the years. There are several types of fees (some require to pay only once and some require to pay once or twice every year) and so-called ""course fee"" is officially only one of those fees. In Keio University, Tuition fees vary and depend on the course. Social Science & Humanity studies require the least fees with approximately 1,110,000 yen per year, and School of Medicine requires the most expensive fees with about 3,610,000 yen per year.[102] The tuition fees in graduate school are much less than those for undergraduate studies, as 690,000 yen per year for Social Science & Humanities and 1,313,000 yen per year for School of Medicine.[103] Although it is acceptable to pay twice with half in spring and half in autumn, the ""entrance fee"" is necessary to be paid before enrollment.

Keio was established by the fund of Tokugawa shogunate, so it was hard to work for the new government in this sense. Fukuzawa in fact criticized severely Kaishū Katsu and Takeaki Enomoto who worked for both Tokugawa and the new government (see Fukuzawa Yukichi). His such strict viewpoint had prevented Keio to set up a political department, and kept many Keio graduate away from politics for a long time.

Jump to the content Jump to the navigation Header start Home About Keio About KeioOver 160 Years of Tradition and Innovation About Keio Content start Over 160 Years of Traditionand Innovation Established in 1858 by Yukichi Fukuzawa as a small school of Western learning, Keio has a history as Japan’s very first private institution of higher learning. Over 160 years since its founding, Keio has thrived under its founder’s motto of jitsugaku, or empirical science, as it continues to transform Japan as a modern nation through contributions to education, research, and medicine. Jitsugaku ( 実学 ) Jitsugaku is a way of learning about the world pursued by Keio University’s founder Yukichi Fukuzawa through the application of reason, observation, and verification, and it stemmed from his desire to break free of the Confucian ideals that informed scholarship in 19th-century Japan. Jitsugaku is science in the truest sense of the word and a powerful tool in Keio University’s never-ending search for practical solutions to real-life problems. Global Engagement Keio University leverages its strengths as a comprehensive university to promote multidisciplinary research under the three initiatives of Longevity, Security, and Creativity. We are also cultivating individuals equipped with international mindsets and making contributions to solve both domestic and global challenges through international joint research under these three initiatives while developing various educational programs. →See more Office of the President Pursuing Our Ideals Professor Kohei ItohPresident, Keio University →See more Philosophy “It is said that Heaven does not create one man above or below another man.” So begins Yukichi Fukuzawa’s book, An Encouragement of Learning, written at the beginning of the Meiji period. Here Fukuzawa expounded the importance of freedom, equality, and human rights, leading the nation into a new era—the modern Japan we know today. Keio University is where his educational philosophy continues to live on today. →See more History See the transformation of Keio University from its origins as a small school for Dutch studies in 1858 to its position as a powerhouse of Japanese education and research today. →See more Alumni Network The lifelong bonds and sense of solidarity between alumni, as well as the strong connection between alumni and the university, are distinctive features and a great source of pride for Keio University.

In the Jewish Museum of Switzerland’s collection. Jewish National Fund (Hebrew: קֶרֶן קַיֶּימֶת לְיִשְׂרָאֵל‎, Keren Kayemet LeYisrael, previously הפאנד הלאומי‎, Ha Fund HaLeumi) was founded in 1901 to buy and develop land in Ottoman Palestine (later the British Mandate for Palestine, and subsequently Israel and the Palestinian territories) for Jewish settlement.[2] The JNF is a non-profit organization.[3][4] By 2007, it owned 13% of the total land in Israel.[5] Since its inception, the JNF says it has planted over 240 million trees in Israel. It has also built 180 dams and reservoirs, developed 250,000 acres (1,000 km2) of land and established more than 1,000 parks.[6] In 2002, the JNF was awarded the Israel Prize for lifetime achievement and special contribution to society and the State of Israel.[7][8] Contents 1 Name 2 History 2.1 Ottoman era 2.2 British Mandate 2.3 State of Israel 3 Reclamation projects 3.1 Afforestation 3.2 Water conservation 3.3 Land development 4 International fundraising arms 4.1 United States 4.2 United Kingdom 4.3 Canada 5 JNF collection boxes 6 Controversies 6.1 Transparency 6.2 Leasing policy controversy 6.3 Legal conflicts 7 See also 8 References 9 External links Name[edit] The name Keren Kayemet comes from the Mishnah. Tractate Peah (1:1) lists the types of good deeds whose rewards are enjoyed in this world, while the principal merit will be in the world to come: hakeren kayemet lo l’olam haba.[9] History[edit] JNF postage stamp, c. 1915 The idea of a national land purchasing fund was first presented at the First Zionist Congress in 1897 by Hermann Schapira, a German-Jewish professor of mathematics.[10] The fund, named Keren Hakayemet (later known in English as the ""Jewish National Fund"") was formally established at the Fifth Zionist Congress in Basel in 1901.[11] In its early years, the organization was headed by the Jewish industrialist Johann Kremenezky.[12] Early land purchases were completed in Judea and the Lower Galilee. In 1909, the JNF played a central role in the founding of Tel Aviv. The establishment of the “Olive Tree Fund” marked the beginning of Diaspora support of afforestation efforts. The Blue Box (known in Yiddish as a pushke) has been part of the JNF since its inception, symbolizing the partnership between Israel and the Diaspora. In the period between the two world wars, about one million of these blue and white tin collection boxes could be found in Jewish homes throughout the world.[13] From 1902 until the late 1940s, the JNF sold JNF stamps to raise money. For a brief period in May 1948, JNF stamps were used as postage stamps during the transition from Palestine to Israel.[14] Ottoman era[edit] The first parcel of land, 200 dunams (0.20 km2) east of Hadera, was received as a gift from the Russian Zionist leader Isaac Leib Goldberg of Vilnius, in 1903. It became an olive grove.[15] In 1904 and 1905, the JNF purchased land plots near the Sea of Galilee and at Ben Shemen. In 1921, JNF land holdings reached 25,000 acres (100 km²), rising to 50,000 acres (200 km²) by 1927. At the end of 1935, JNF held 89,500 acres (362 km²) of land housing 108 Jewish communities.[16] British Mandate[edit] JNF head office in Jerusalem under construction 1938 JNF staff Jerusalem 1940 JNF publicity in 1945 In 1939, 10% of the Jewish population of the British Mandate of Palestine lived on JNF land. JNF holdings by the end of the British Mandate period amounted to 936 km².[17] By 1948, the JNF owned 54% of the land held by Jews in the region,[18] or a bit less than 4% of the land in what was then known as the British Mandate of Palestine.[19] By the eve of statehood, the JNF had acquired a total of 936,000 dunams (936 km2; 361 sq mi) of land;[20] another 800,000 dunams (800 km2; 310 sq mi) had been acquired by other Jewish organizations or individuals.[21] Most of the JNF's activities during the Mandatory period were closely associated with Yossef Weitz, the head of its settlement department. From the beginning, JNF's policy was to lease land long-term rather than sell it. In its charter, the JNF states: ""Since the first land purchase in Eretz Israel in the early 1900s for and on behalf of the Jewish People, JNF has served as the Jewish People's trustee of the land, initiating and charting development work to enable Jewish settlement from the border in the north to the edge of the desert and Arava in the south.""[citation needed] State of Israel[edit] Planting trees in the Gilboa mountains, c.1960 After Israel's establishment in 1948, the government began to sell absentee lands to the JNF. On January 27, 1949, 1,000 km² of land (from a total of about 3,500 km²) was sold to the JNF for the price of I£11 million. Another 1,000 km² of land was sold to the JNF in October 1950. Over the years questions about the legitimacy of these transactions have been raised but Israeli legislation has generally supported the JNF's land claims.[22][23][24] In 1953, the JNF was dissolved and re-organized as an Israeli company under the name Keren Kayemet LeYisrael (JNF-KKL). In 1960, administration of the land held by the JNF-KKL, apart from forested areas, was transferred to a newly formed government agency, the Israel Land Administration (ILA). The ILA was then responsible for managing some 93% of the land of Israel.[25] All the land managed by the ILA was defined as Israel lands; it included both land owned by the government (about 80%) and land owned by the JNF-KKL (about 13%).[26] The JNF-KKL received the right to nominate 10 of the 22 directors of the ILA, lending it significant leverage within that state body. After concentrating on the centre and northern part of the young state, the JNF-KKL started supporting Jewish settlements around the Negev border from around 1965. After the Six-Day War in 1967, the JNF-KKL started work in the newly occupied Palestinian territories as well.[better source needed][27] Reclamation projects[edit] The JNF charter specifies the reclamation of land for the Jewish people as its primary purpose. During the 1980s, almost 60,000 acres (240 km2) were planted. Over 50,000 acres (200 km2) of crop-land were reclaimed, and hundreds of miles of roads built. Research into the soil and water conservation and the construction of dams and reservoirs took on added importance in the face of water shortages and drought. The JNF's collaborative work involves participation in the International Arid Land Consortium, which explores the problems and solutions unique to arid and semiarid regions, working to develop sustainable ecological practices to improve the quality of life among people in the dry areas.[28] Afforestation[edit] Eshtaol Forest planted by JNF Dedication of Pope John Paul Forest in Nazareth Jerusalem forest The early JNF was active in afforestation and reclamation of land. By 1935, JNF had planted 1.7 million trees over a total area of 1,750 acres (7.08 km²) and drained swamps, like those in the Hula Valley.[13] Over fifty years, the JNF planted over 260 million trees largely in semi-arid, rocky, hilly terrain in which cultivation is not cost-effective and the risk of land degradation is high.[3] While the Ministry of Agriculture is the official regulator of Israel's forests, the JNF is responsible for the implementation of forest management and afforestation.[29] In 2006, the JNF signed a 49-year lease agreement with the State of Israel which gives it control over 30,000 hectares (300 km2) of Negev land for the development of forests.[3] The JNF has been criticized for planting non-native pine trees which are unsuited to the climate, rather than local species such as olive trees.[30] Others say that JNF deserves credit for this decision, and the forests would not have survived otherwise.[31] According to JNF statistics, six out of every 10 saplings planted at a JNF site in Jerusalem do not survive, although the survival rate for planting sites outside Jerusalem is much higher – close to 95 percent. The Israeli newspaper Maariv claimed that workers remove saplings daily to allow more tourists to plant the following day, but the JNF denied this and said it would sue the paper for libel.[32] The Union for Environmental Defense has criticized the fund's forestry practices for ""overreliance on highly flammable pine trees"" and overuse of toxic herbicides, in the context of minimal government and public scrutiny.[32] Some forests have been planted for security reasons[33] and as a means of demarcating Israeli space.[34] Critics argue that many JNF lands outside the West Bank were illegally confiscated from Palestinian refugees, and that the JNF furthermore should not be involved with lands in the West Bank.[19] Shaul Ephraim Cohen has claimed that trees have been planted to restrict Bedouin herding.[35] Susan Nathan wrote that forests were planted on the site of abandoned Arab villages after the 1948 war.[36] Nathan also writes that olive trees were replaced by pine and cypress trees[37] and that JNF afforestation policy erases traces of the Arab presence prior to 1948.[38] In 2008, the JNF announced that historical information plaques erected in JNF parks and forests would cite the names of the Arab villages formerly located there.[39] Since 2009, the JNF has been helping the Palestinian Authority plan public parks and other civic amenities for the Palestinian city of Rawabi, north of Ramallah. The JNF provided the Palestinian Authority with 3,000 tree seedlings for a forested area being developed on the edge of the new city.[40] Water conservation[edit] Israel's fresh water supply is dependent on 50 days a year of seasonal rainfall, while water consumption has doubled since 1960. Towards the end of the 1980s, the JNF undertook several large-scale water conservation projects. Dams and reservoirs were built to capture rainwater run-off which would have otherwise been lost in the Arava Valley, Reshafim in the Beit She'arim Valley and Kedma near Kiryat Gat. An artificial lake was built in Timna Park.[41] The JNF has built 200 reservoirs around the country, and plans to build 30 more reservoirs and water treatment plants over the next five years.[when?] Over the past decade,[when?] JNF has invested over $114.99 million in reservoir construction, increasing the country's total storage capacity by 7%, to over 130 million cubic metres (34×10^9 US gal) of water. JNF is also involved in river rehabilitation projects all over Israel, such as the Nahal Alexander Restoration Project begun in 2003. Land development[edit] JNF trees in the Negev Desert. Man-made dunes (here a liman) help keep in rainwater, creating an oasis. The JNF's engagement in developing Israel for Jewish purposes has involved a range of massive land infrastructure development projects. In the 1980s, the JNF launched a project known collectively as ""Operation Promised Land,"" to meet the challenge of the massive upsurge of Jewish immigration from the Soviet Union and Ethiopia. In recent years, the JNF has again moved towards the development of towns to accommodate new Jewish immigrants, focusing on the Galilee and Negev regions, the two areas of Israel with a tenuous Jewish demographic majority. In particular, the JNF's 600 million dollar Blueprint Negev aims to attract and build infrastructure for 250,000 new settlers in the Negev desert, which accounts for 60% of the country's land mass but remains sparsely populated.[42] The plan has come under scrutiny as groups such as Bustan, Save the Negev, and Ohalah have expressed concern over the project's lack of transparency in light of the potential strain on ecological resources and the possible impacts on Bedouin communities nearby.[43][44][45][46] International fundraising arms[edit] United States[edit] Benefit concert at David's Citadel, 1926 The United States arm of the JNF, incorporated on January 26, 1926, is the largest contributor to JNF-KKL.[27] In 1996, JNF-USA was accused of mismanaging funds. According to the charges, only 21% of US donations reached Israel, and money was being diverted to Latin American JNF offices. In the wake of this scandal, the North American management was forced to resign.[34] The tax-exempt status of the JNF-USA was challenged in 2011 as violating the public policy of the United States with respect to ethnic and religious discrimination.[47] In July 2017, in response to an investigation by the Jewish Daily Forward, the New York State attorney general's office ordered JNF-USA to rescind two illegal loans totaling more than $500,000 the organization had made to its chief executive officer, Russell Robinson, and its chief financial officer, Mitchel Rosenzweig. (New York State forbids charities from lending their officers any money.) JNF-USA argued that Robinson and Rosenzweig were not officers under the meaning of the law, but the attorney general's officer rejected that argument and the two executives agreed to repay the balance of their loans.[48] United Kingdom[edit] In the United Kingdom, the JNF-UK (full name JNF Charitable Trust) was formed in 1939 and registered as a charitable organization.[49] In October 2005, the JNF-KKL in Israel split from its British partner, accusing JNF-UK of having ""misled"" the public.[50] The JNF-KKL claimed that the British group was using the KKL name to raise funds ""for their own causes which are not associated with KKL."" The Israeli JNF-KKL said it would launch a separate fundraising operation in the UK. JNF-UK launched a legal action to stop KKL using the names ""JNF"" or ""Jewish National Fund"" in the UK. The two organisations made peace after the Israeli-born businessman Samuel Hayek took over as JNF-UK chairman in 2008.[51] Israeli JNF-KKL ended its dispute with the JNF-UK within weeks of ending a similar dispute with the American JNF-USA[52] The charitable status of the JNF-UK has come under increasing attack.[53] British prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown had been Honorary Patrons of the JNF-UK, like all British prime ministers before them since its inception. David Cameron resigned as Honorary Patron to JNF-UK in 2011.[54] According to a spokesman, Cameron said it was an organisation that was specifically focused around work in one specific country—i.e., Israel.[55] Cameron's decision was interpreted as a snub, in spite of the spokesman's assurances that his decision had ""absolutely nothing to do with any anti-Israel campaign"". However, campaigners claimed that Cameron's resignation was due to political pressure.[56] Since then, the JNF-UK's Honorary Patrons include no leader of the main British political parties. An Early Day Motion in the British parliament called for the revocation of the JNF's charitable status in the UK and was signed by 66 Members of Parliament.[57][58] In 2012 the Green Party called for the JNF to be stripped of its charity status.[59] Canada[edit] Following the Six-Day War, the Canadian arm of the JNF raised about $15 million US to fund a 1,700-acre park called ""Canada Park."" The park was built in 1970 on land that had been occupied until the war by three Palestinian villages, which were destroyed on the orders of Yitzhak Rabin.[60] Starting around 2013, Independent Jewish Voices has campaigned against JNF Canada's charitable status, and in 2017 it filed a formal complaint with the Canadian government seeking the revocation of JNF's charitable status on the basis of discrimination.[61] JNF collection boxes[edit] JNF collection box JNF's blue charity boxes were distributed by the JNF almost from its inception at the initiative of Johann Kremenezky.[12] Once found in many Jewish homes, the boxes became one of the most familiar symbols of Zionism. A children's song about the boxes, written by Dr. Yehoshua Frizman, Headmaster of the Real Gymnasium for Girls in Kovno, ran The box is hanging on the wall The blue box Each penny put inside Redeems the land.[62] A bank clerk named Haim Kleinman in Nadvorna, Galicia placed a blue box labeled ""Keren Le'umit"" in his office and urged others to do the same. The first mass-produced boxes were distributed in 1904.[63] Kleinman visited Mandate Palestine in the 1930s and planned to make aliyah, but perished in the Holocaust.[63] Menahem Ussishkin wrote that ""The coin the child contributes or collects for the redemption of the land is not important in itself; it is not the child that gives to the Keren Kayemeth, but rather the Fund that gives to the child, a foothold and lofty ideal for all the days of his life.""[63] The boxes could take a variety of shapes and sizes. Some were paper made to fold flat like envelopes and able to contain only a small number of coins, some early American boxes were cylindrical, some German boxes were made of tin stamped into the shape of bound books.[63] Israel issued postage stamps bearing the image of the blue box in 1983, 1991, and 1993 for the JNF's 90th anniversary.[63] Controversies[edit] Transparency[edit] T'ruah has expressed concerns that the JNF is not transparent about where their funds go and that the organization may be subsidizing projects in West Bank settlements.[64] The organization's chief executive later acknowledged that JNF does fund projects within settlements.[65] A review of their tax filing from 2014 led Rabbi Jill Jacobs of T'ruah to estimate that about $600,000 of the $27.2 million in grants by JNF-USA went to support settlements.[66] In 2021, JNF announced that it would change its policy and subsidize Israeli settlements in the West Bank[67].[68] Israeli lawmakers have sought, unsuccessfully, to allow the State Comptroller to examine the books of the organization to determine whether the group's funds were being spent appropriately.[69] Leasing policy controversy[edit] A community in the Negev established by the JNF under its Blueprint Negev program Aminadav Forest The JNF stipulates that only Jews can buy, mortgage or lease JNF land. Article 23 of the JNF lease states that the lessee must pay compensation to the JNF if this stipulation is violated.[70] On 13 October 2004, Adalah, an organization and legal center for Arab minority rights in Israel, submitted a petition to the Supreme Court entitled Challenging the Prohibition on Arab Citizens of Israel from Living on Jewish National Fund Land.[71] Shortly afterwards, the Association for Civil Rights in Israel and the Arab Center for Alternative Planning also filed a petition to the Supreme Court challenging the ILA policy as discriminatory.[72] The JNF responded to the two petitions on 9 December. In its response, the JNF stated: The JNF is not the trustee of the general public in Israel. Its loyalty is given to the Jewish people in the Diaspora and in the state of Israel... The JNF, in relation to being an owner of land, is not a public body that works for the benefit of all citizens of the state. The loyalty of the JNF is given to the Jewish people and only to them is the JNF obligated. The JNF, as the owner of the JNF land, does not have a duty to practice equality towards all citizens of the state.[73] On 26 January 2005, Israel's Attorney General Menachem Mazuz ruled that lease restrictions violated Israeli anti-discrimination laws, and that the ILA could not discriminate against Arab citizens of Israel in the marketing and allocation of the lands it managed; this applied both to government lands and to lands belonging to the JNF. However, the Attorney General also decided that, whenever a non-Jewish citizen wins an ILA tender for a plot of JNF-owned land, the ILA would compensate the JNF with an equal amount of land. This would allow the JNF to maintain its current hold over 2,500,000 dunams (2,500 km2) of land, or 13% of the total land in Israel. As a result of the Mazuz ruling, authorities found themselves facing a conundrum: on the one hand the JNF, as a ""private"" organization, had received donations from outside Israel which were specifically earmarked for the benefit of Jews; on the other hand, the state and the ILA (an agency of the state), which administered the land owned by the JNF, were banned from discriminating against non-Jews. In early 2005, the JNF and the Finance Ministry were reported as trying to draft a new agreement that would separate the JNF from the state, thereby allowing it to continue selling land to Jews only.[74] In July 2007, the Israeli Knesset approved the Jewish National Fund Bill, submitted by MK Uri Ariel (National Union/National Religious Party), in its preliminary reading; but the bill was later dropped. The bill sought to authorize the JNF practice of refusing to lease land to Arab citizens.[75] The bill called for a new provision to the 1960 Israel Land Administration Law, entitled ""Management of the Jewish National Fund's Lands""; the provision stated that regardless of other conflicting rulings, leasing JNF lands for Jewish settlement did not constitute discrimination, and: ""For the purpose of every law, the association documents of the Jewish National Fund will be interpreted according to the judgment of the Jewish National Fund's founders and from a nationalist-Zionist standpoint.""[76] In September 2007, the High Court heard a further Adalah petition seeking cancellation of an ILA policy as well as Article 27 of the Regulations of the Obligations of Tenders, which in concert prevent Arab citizens from participating in bids for JNF-controlled land.[77] The High Court of Justice agreed to delay a ruling by at least four months, and a temporary settlement was reached (following the compromise proposed in 2005 by Menachem Mazuz) wherein, although the JNF would be prevented from discriminating on grounds of ethnicity, nevertheless every time land is sold to a non-Jew, the ILA would compensate it with an equivalent amount of land, thus ensuring the total amount of land owned by Jewish Israelis remains the same.[5] An alternative proposal submitted by Amnon Rubinstein, a former minister, recommended that a distinction be made between JNF lands and state lands, such that all JNF lands directly acquired via donations from abroad specifically for the benefit of Jews (some 900,000 dunams (900 km2)) will pass to the direct control of the JNF; while properties purchased by the JNF from the state in the 1950s and formerly belonging to Palestinian refugees (the so-called ""lands of missing persons"" or ""absentee"" lands, amounting to 2,000,000 dunams (2,000 km2)) would revert to state control.[78] Rubinstein's intention was ""to avoid passing racist legislation [such as the Ariel Bill] that would limit the use of these lands to the Jews"". Others denied however that the Ariel Bill was racist.[79] The Rubinstein proposal was not taken up. In late 2007 a land swap deal was proposed that would allowing the JNF to continue leasing its lands only to Jews. Urban JNF land sold in future to non-Jews would include an automatic swap mechanism: the fund would transfer the land to the ILA, and in exchange would receive the purchase price plus a similar-sized plot in the Negev.[80] Legal conflicts[edit] In December 2011, Seth Morrison resigned from the board of JNF-USA in protest at the decision by Himnuta, a subsidiary of JNF-KKL, to launch eviction proceedings against the Sumarin family, who lived in the Silwan neighborhood of East Jerusalem.[81] In the case of the Sumarin family, the children of the original owner, Musa Sumarin, were declared absentees after his death even though there were other family members living in the home at the time. In 1991, the Israeli government took the step of transferring the property to the JNF subsidiary.[82] A campaign against the JNF's eviction was launched by Rabbis for Human Rights, the Sheikh Jarrah Solidarity Movement,[83] and the Jewish organization Yachad.[84] The pressures led the JNF to delay the eviction.[83] The JNF played a similar role in evicting the Gozlan family in the 1990s.[85] See also[edit] Central Zionist Archives in Jerusalem.

In the Jewish Museum of Switzerland’s collection. Jewish National Fund (Hebrew: קֶרֶן קַיֶּימֶת לְיִשְׂרָאֵל‎, Keren Kayemet LeYisrael, previously הפאנד הלאומי‎, Ha Fund HaLeumi) was founded in 1901 to buy and develop land in Ottoman Palestine (later the British Mandate for Palestine, and subsequently Israel and the Palestinian territories) for Jewish settlement.[2] The JNF is a non-profit organization.[3][4] By 2007, it owned 13% of the total land in Israel.[5] Since its inception, the JNF says it has planted over 240 million trees in Israel. It has also built 180 dams and reservoirs, developed 250,000 acres (1,000 km2) of land and established more than 1,000 parks.[6] In 2002, the JNF was awarded the Israel Prize for lifetime achievement and special contribution to society and the State of Israel.[7][8] Contents 1 Name 2 History 2.1 Ottoman era 2.2 British Mandate 2.3 State of Israel 3 Reclamation projects 3.1 Afforestation 3.2 Water conservation 3.3 Land development 4 International fundraising arms 4.1 United States 4.2 United Kingdom 4.3 Canada 5 JNF collection boxes 6 Controversies 6.1 Transparency 6.2 Leasing policy controversy 6.3 Legal conflicts 7 See also 8 References 9 External links Name[edit] The name Keren Kayemet comes from the Mishnah. Tractate Peah (1:1) lists the types of good deeds whose rewards are enjoyed in this world, while the principal merit will be in the world to come: hakeren kayemet lo l’olam haba.[9] History[edit] JNF postage stamp, c. 1915 The idea of a national land purchasing fund was first presented at the First Zionist Congress in 1897 by Hermann Schapira, a German-Jewish professor of mathematics.[10] The fund, named Keren Hakayemet (later known in English as the ""Jewish National Fund"") was formally established at the Fifth Zionist Congress in Basel in 1901.[11] In its early years, the organization was headed by the Jewish industrialist Johann Kremenezky.[12] Early land purchases were completed in Judea and the Lower Galilee. In 1909, the JNF played a central role in the founding of Tel Aviv. The establishment of the “Olive Tree Fund” marked the beginning of Diaspora support of afforestation efforts. The Blue Box (known in Yiddish as a pushke) has been part of the JNF since its inception, symbolizing the partnership between Israel and the Diaspora. In the period between the two world wars, about one million of these blue and white tin collection boxes could be found in Jewish homes throughout the world.[13] From 1902 until the late 1940s, the JNF sold JNF stamps to raise money. For a brief period in May 1948, JNF stamps were used as postage stamps during the transition from Palestine to Israel.[14] Ottoman era[edit] The first parcel of land, 200 dunams (0.20 km2) east of Hadera, was received as a gift from the Russian Zionist leader Isaac Leib Goldberg of Vilnius, in 1903. It became an olive grove.[15] In 1904 and 1905, the JNF purchased land plots near the Sea of Galilee and at Ben Shemen. In 1921, JNF land holdings reached 25,000 acres (100 km²), rising to 50,000 acres (200 km²) by 1927. At the end of 1935, JNF held 89,500 acres (362 km²) of land housing 108 Jewish communities.[16] British Mandate[edit] JNF head office in Jerusalem under construction 1938 JNF staff Jerusalem 1940 JNF publicity in 1945 In 1939, 10% of the Jewish population of the British Mandate of Palestine lived on JNF land. JNF holdings by the end of the British Mandate period amounted to 936 km².[17] By 1948, the JNF owned 54% of the land held by Jews in the region,[18] or a bit less than 4% of the land in what was then known as the British Mandate of Palestine.[19] By the eve of statehood, the JNF had acquired a total of 936,000 dunams (936 km2; 361 sq mi) of land;[20] another 800,000 dunams (800 km2; 310 sq mi) had been acquired by other Jewish organizations or individuals.[21] Most of the JNF's activities during the Mandatory period were closely associated with Yossef Weitz, the head of its settlement department. From the beginning, JNF's policy was to lease land long-term rather than sell it. In its charter, the JNF states: ""Since the first land purchase in Eretz Israel in the early 1900s for and on behalf of the Jewish People, JNF has served as the Jewish People's trustee of the land, initiating and charting development work to enable Jewish settlement from the border in the north to the edge of the desert and Arava in the south.""[citation needed] State of Israel[edit] Planting trees in the Gilboa mountains, c.1960 After Israel's establishment in 1948, the government began to sell absentee lands to the JNF. On January 27, 1949, 1,000 km² of land (from a total of about 3,500 km²) was sold to the JNF for the price of I£11 million. Another 1,000 km² of land was sold to the JNF in October 1950. Over the years questions about the legitimacy of these transactions have been raised but Israeli legislation has generally supported the JNF's land claims.[22][23][24] In 1953, the JNF was dissolved and re-organized as an Israeli company under the name Keren Kayemet LeYisrael (JNF-KKL). In 1960, administration of the land held by the JNF-KKL, apart from forested areas, was transferred to a newly formed government agency, the Israel Land Administration (ILA). The ILA was then responsible for managing some 93% of the land of Israel.[25] All the land managed by the ILA was defined as Israel lands; it included both land owned by the government (about 80%) and land owned by the JNF-KKL (about 13%).[26] The JNF-KKL received the right to nominate 10 of the 22 directors of the ILA, lending it significant leverage within that state body. After concentrating on the centre and northern part of the young state, the JNF-KKL started supporting Jewish settlements around the Negev border from around 1965. After the Six-Day War in 1967, the JNF-KKL started work in the newly occupied Palestinian territories as well.[better source needed][27] Reclamation projects[edit] The JNF charter specifies the reclamation of land for the Jewish people as its primary purpose. During the 1980s, almost 60,000 acres (240 km2) were planted. Over 50,000 acres (200 km2) of crop-land were reclaimed, and hundreds of miles of roads built. Research into the soil and water conservation and the construction of dams and reservoirs took on added importance in the face of water shortages and drought. The JNF's collaborative work involves participation in the International Arid Land Consortium, which explores the problems and solutions unique to arid and semiarid regions, working to develop sustainable ecological practices to improve the quality of life among people in the dry areas.[28] Afforestation[edit] Eshtaol Forest planted by JNF Dedication of Pope John Paul Forest in Nazareth Jerusalem forest The early JNF was active in afforestation and reclamation of land. By 1935, JNF had planted 1.7 million trees over a total area of 1,750 acres (7.08 km²) and drained swamps, like those in the Hula Valley.[13] Over fifty years, the JNF planted over 260 million trees largely in semi-arid, rocky, hilly terrain in which cultivation is not cost-effective and the risk of land degradation is high.[3] While the Ministry of Agriculture is the official regulator of Israel's forests, the JNF is responsible for the implementation of forest management and afforestation.[29] In 2006, the JNF signed a 49-year lease agreement with the State of Israel which gives it control over 30,000 hectares (300 km2) of Negev land for the development of forests.[3] The JNF has been criticized for planting non-native pine trees which are unsuited to the climate, rather than local species such as olive trees.[30] Others say that JNF deserves credit for this decision, and the forests would not have survived otherwise.[31] According to JNF statistics, six out of every 10 saplings planted at a JNF site in Jerusalem do not survive, although the survival rate for planting sites outside Jerusalem is much higher – close to 95 percent. The Israeli newspaper Maariv claimed that workers remove saplings daily to allow more tourists to plant the following day, but the JNF denied this and said it would sue the paper for libel.[32] The Union for Environmental Defense has criticized the fund's forestry practices for ""overreliance on highly flammable pine trees"" and overuse of toxic herbicides, in the context of minimal government and public scrutiny.[32] Some forests have been planted for security reasons[33] and as a means of demarcating Israeli space.[34] Critics argue that many JNF lands outside the West Bank were illegally confiscated from Palestinian refugees, and that the JNF furthermore should not be involved with lands in the West Bank.[19] Shaul Ephraim Cohen has claimed that trees have been planted to restrict Bedouin herding.[35] Susan Nathan wrote that forests were planted on the site of abandoned Arab villages after the 1948 war.[36] Nathan also writes that olive trees were replaced by pine and cypress trees[37] and that JNF afforestation policy erases traces of the Arab presence prior to 1948.[38] In 2008, the JNF announced that historical information plaques erected in JNF parks and forests would cite the names of the Arab villages formerly located there.[39] Since 2009, the JNF has been helping the Palestinian Authority plan public parks and other civic amenities for the Palestinian city of Rawabi, north of Ramallah. The JNF provided the Palestinian Authority with 3,000 tree seedlings for a forested area being developed on the edge of the new city.[40] Water conservation[edit] Israel's fresh water supply is dependent on 50 days a year of seasonal rainfall, while water consumption has doubled since 1960. Towards the end of the 1980s, the JNF undertook several large-scale water conservation projects. Dams and reservoirs were built to capture rainwater run-off which would have otherwise been lost in the Arava Valley, Reshafim in the Beit She'arim Valley and Kedma near Kiryat Gat. An artificial lake was built in Timna Park.[41] The JNF has built 200 reservoirs around the country, and plans to build 30 more reservoirs and water treatment plants over the next five years.[when?] Over the past decade,[when?] JNF has invested over $114.99 million in reservoir construction, increasing the country's total storage capacity by 7%, to over 130 million cubic metres (34×10^9 US gal) of water. JNF is also involved in river rehabilitation projects all over Israel, such as the Nahal Alexander Restoration Project begun in 2003. Land development[edit] JNF trees in the Negev Desert. Man-made dunes (here a liman) help keep in rainwater, creating an oasis. The JNF's engagement in developing Israel for Jewish purposes has involved a range of massive land infrastructure development projects. In the 1980s, the JNF launched a project known collectively as ""Operation Promised Land,"" to meet the challenge of the massive upsurge of Jewish immigration from the Soviet Union and Ethiopia. In recent years, the JNF has again moved towards the development of towns to accommodate new Jewish immigrants, focusing on the Galilee and Negev regions, the two areas of Israel with a tenuous Jewish demographic majority. In particular, the JNF's 600 million dollar Blueprint Negev aims to attract and build infrastructure for 250,000 new settlers in the Negev desert, which accounts for 60% of the country's land mass but remains sparsely populated.[42] The plan has come under scrutiny as groups such as Bustan, Save the Negev, and Ohalah have expressed concern over the project's lack of transparency in light of the potential strain on ecological resources and the possible impacts on Bedouin communities nearby.[43][44][45][46] International fundraising arms[edit] United States[edit] Benefit concert at David's Citadel, 1926 The United States arm of the JNF, incorporated on January 26, 1926, is the largest contributor to JNF-KKL.[27] In 1996, JNF-USA was accused of mismanaging funds. According to the charges, only 21% of US donations reached Israel, and money was being diverted to Latin American JNF offices. In the wake of this scandal, the North American management was forced to resign.[34] The tax-exempt status of the JNF-USA was challenged in 2011 as violating the public policy of the United States with respect to ethnic and religious discrimination.[47] In July 2017, in response to an investigation by the Jewish Daily Forward, the New York State attorney general's office ordered JNF-USA to rescind two illegal loans totaling more than $500,000 the organization had made to its chief executive officer, Russell Robinson, and its chief financial officer, Mitchel Rosenzweig. (New York State forbids charities from lending their officers any money.) JNF-USA argued that Robinson and Rosenzweig were not officers under the meaning of the law, but the attorney general's officer rejected that argument and the two executives agreed to repay the balance of their loans.[48] United Kingdom[edit] In the United Kingdom, the JNF-UK (full name JNF Charitable Trust) was formed in 1939 and registered as a charitable organization.[49] In October 2005, the JNF-KKL in Israel split from its British partner, accusing JNF-UK of having ""misled"" the public.[50] The JNF-KKL claimed that the British group was using the KKL name to raise funds ""for their own causes which are not associated with KKL."" The Israeli JNF-KKL said it would launch a separate fundraising operation in the UK. JNF-UK launched a legal action to stop KKL using the names ""JNF"" or ""Jewish National Fund"" in the UK. The two organisations made peace after the Israeli-born businessman Samuel Hayek took over as JNF-UK chairman in 2008.[51] Israeli JNF-KKL ended its dispute with the JNF-UK within weeks of ending a similar dispute with the American JNF-USA[52] The charitable status of the JNF-UK has come under increasing attack.[53] British prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown had been Honorary Patrons of the JNF-UK, like all British prime ministers before them since its inception. David Cameron resigned as Honorary Patron to JNF-UK in 2011.[54] According to a spokesman, Cameron said it was an organisation that was specifically focused around work in one specific country—i.e., Israel.[55] Cameron's decision was interpreted as a snub, in spite of the spokesman's assurances that his decision had ""absolutely nothing to do with any anti-Israel campaign"". However, campaigners claimed that Cameron's resignation was due to political pressure.[56] Since then, the JNF-UK's Honorary Patrons include no leader of the main British political parties. An Early Day Motion in the British parliament called for the revocation of the JNF's charitable status in the UK and was signed by 66 Members of Parliament.[57][58] In 2012 the Green Party called for the JNF to be stripped of its charity status.[59] Canada[edit] Following the Six-Day War, the Canadian arm of the JNF raised about $15 million US to fund a 1,700-acre park called ""Canada Park."" The park was built in 1970 on land that had been occupied until the war by three Palestinian villages, which were destroyed on the orders of Yitzhak Rabin.[60] Starting around 2013, Independent Jewish Voices has campaigned against JNF Canada's charitable status, and in 2017 it filed a formal complaint with the Canadian government seeking the revocation of JNF's charitable status on the basis of discrimination.[61] JNF collection boxes[edit] JNF collection box JNF's blue charity boxes were distributed by the JNF almost from its inception at the initiative of Johann Kremenezky.[12] Once found in many Jewish homes, the boxes became one of the most familiar symbols of Zionism. A children's song about the boxes, written by Dr. Yehoshua Frizman, Headmaster of the Real Gymnasium for Girls in Kovno, ran The box is hanging on the wall The blue box Each penny put inside Redeems the land.[62] A bank clerk named Haim Kleinman in Nadvorna, Galicia placed a blue box labeled ""Keren Le'umit"" in his office and urged others to do the same. The first mass-produced boxes were distributed in 1904.[63] Kleinman visited Mandate Palestine in the 1930s and planned to make aliyah, but perished in the Holocaust.[63] Menahem Ussishkin wrote that ""The coin the child contributes or collects for the redemption of the land is not important in itself; it is not the child that gives to the Keren Kayemeth, but rather the Fund that gives to the child, a foothold and lofty ideal for all the days of his life.""[63] The boxes could take a variety of shapes and sizes. Some were paper made to fold flat like envelopes and able to contain only a small number of coins, some early American boxes were cylindrical, some German boxes were made of tin stamped into the shape of bound books.[63] Israel issued postage stamps bearing the image of the blue box in 1983, 1991, and 1993 for the JNF's 90th anniversary.[63] Controversies[edit] Transparency[edit] T'ruah has expressed concerns that the JNF is not transparent about where their funds go and that the organization may be subsidizing projects in West Bank settlements.[64] The organization's chief executive later acknowledged that JNF does fund projects within settlements.[65] A review of their tax filing from 2014 led Rabbi Jill Jacobs of T'ruah to estimate that about $600,000 of the $27.2 million in grants by JNF-USA went to support settlements.[66] In 2021, JNF announced that it would change its policy and subsidize Israeli settlements in the West Bank[67].[68] Israeli lawmakers have sought, unsuccessfully, to allow the State Comptroller to examine the books of the organization to determine whether the group's funds were being spent appropriately.[69] Leasing policy controversy[edit] A community in the Negev established by the JNF under its Blueprint Negev program Aminadav Forest The JNF stipulates that only Jews can buy, mortgage or lease JNF land. Article 23 of the JNF lease states that the lessee must pay compensation to the JNF if this stipulation is violated.[70] On 13 October 2004, Adalah, an organization and legal center for Arab minority rights in Israel, submitted a petition to the Supreme Court entitled Challenging the Prohibition on Arab Citizens of Israel from Living on Jewish National Fund Land.[71] Shortly afterwards, the Association for Civil Rights in Israel and the Arab Center for Alternative Planning also filed a petition to the Supreme Court challenging the ILA policy as discriminatory.[72] The JNF responded to the two petitions on 9 December. In its response, the JNF stated: The JNF is not the trustee of the general public in Israel. Its loyalty is given to the Jewish people in the Diaspora and in the state of Israel... The JNF, in relation to being an owner of land, is not a public body that works for the benefit of all citizens of the state. The loyalty of the JNF is given to the Jewish people and only to them is the JNF obligated. The JNF, as the owner of the JNF land, does not have a duty to practice equality towards all citizens of the state.[73] On 26 January 2005, Israel's Attorney General Menachem Mazuz ruled that lease restrictions violated Israeli anti-discrimination laws, and that the ILA could not discriminate against Arab citizens of Israel in the marketing and allocation of the lands it managed; this applied both to government lands and to lands belonging to the JNF. However, the Attorney General also decided that, whenever a non-Jewish citizen wins an ILA tender for a plot of JNF-owned land, the ILA would compensate the JNF with an equal amount of land. This would allow the JNF to maintain its current hold over 2,500,000 dunams (2,500 km2) of land, or 13% of the total land in Israel. As a result of the Mazuz ruling, authorities found themselves facing a conundrum: on the one hand the JNF, as a ""private"" organization, had received donations from outside Israel which were specifically earmarked for the benefit of Jews; on the other hand, the state and the ILA (an agency of the state), which administered the land owned by the JNF, were banned from discriminating against non-Jews. In early 2005, the JNF and the Finance Ministry were reported as trying to draft a new agreement that would separate the JNF from the state, thereby allowing it to continue selling land to Jews only.[74] In July 2007, the Israeli Knesset approved the Jewish National Fund Bill, submitted by MK Uri Ariel (National Union/National Religious Party), in its preliminary reading; but the bill was later dropped. The bill sought to authorize the JNF practice of refusing to lease land to Arab citizens.[75] The bill called for a new provision to the 1960 Israel Land Administration Law, entitled ""Management of the Jewish National Fund's Lands""; the provision stated that regardless of other conflicting rulings, leasing JNF lands for Jewish settlement did not constitute discrimination, and: ""For the purpose of every law, the association documents of the Jewish National Fund will be interpreted according to the judgment of the Jewish National Fund's founders and from a nationalist-Zionist standpoint.""[76] In September 2007, the High Court heard a further Adalah petition seeking cancellation of an ILA policy as well as Article 27 of the Regulations of the Obligations of Tenders, which in concert prevent Arab citizens from participating in bids for JNF-controlled land.[77] The High Court of Justice agreed to delay a ruling by at least four months, and a temporary settlement was reached (following the compromise proposed in 2005 by Menachem Mazuz) wherein, although the JNF would be prevented from discriminating on grounds of ethnicity, nevertheless every time land is sold to a non-Jew, the ILA would compensate it with an equivalent amount of land, thus ensuring the total amount of land owned by Jewish Israelis remains the same.[5] An alternative proposal submitted by Amnon Rubinstein, a former minister, recommended that a distinction be made between JNF lands and state lands, such that all JNF lands directly acquired via donations from abroad specifically for the benefit of Jews (some 900,000 dunams (900 km2)) will pass to the direct control of the JNF; while properties purchased by the JNF from the state in the 1950s and formerly belonging to Palestinian refugees (the so-called ""lands of missing persons"" or ""absentee"" lands, amounting to 2,000,000 dunams (2,000 km2)) would revert to state control.[78] Rubinstein's intention was ""to avoid passing racist legislation [such as the Ariel Bill] that would limit the use of these lands to the Jews"". Others denied however that the Ariel Bill was racist.[79] The Rubinstein proposal was not taken up. In late 2007 a land swap deal was proposed that would allowing the JNF to continue leasing its lands only to Jews. Urban JNF land sold in future to non-Jews would include an automatic swap mechanism: the fund would transfer the land to the ILA, and in exchange would receive the purchase price plus a similar-sized plot in the Negev.[80] Legal conflicts[edit] In December 2011, Seth Morrison resigned from the board of JNF-USA in protest at the decision by Himnuta, a subsidiary of JNF-KKL, to launch eviction proceedings against the Sumarin family, who lived in the Silwan neighborhood of East Jerusalem.[81] In the case of the Sumarin family, the children of the original owner, Musa Sumarin, were declared absentees after his death even though there were other family members living in the home at the time. In 1991, the Israeli government took the step of transferring the property to the JNF subsidiary.[82] A campaign against the JNF's eviction was launched by Rabbis for Human Rights, the Sheikh Jarrah Solidarity Movement,[83] and the Jewish organization Yachad.[84] The pressures led the JNF to delay the eviction.[83] The JNF played a similar role in evicting the Gozlan family in the 1990s.[85] See also[edit] Central Zionist Archives in Jerusalem.

(AP Photo/Sebastian Scheiner) In a contentious vote that passed Thursday by the slimmest of margins, the Jewish National Fund’s board of directors advanced the controversial allocation of NIS 38 million ($11.58 million) in order to purchase lands in the West Bank. The board of Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael Jewish National Fund (KKL-JNF) will meet once again after the March 23 election to determine its policies beyond the Green Line and rule on whether to give final approval for the purchase itself. Left-leaning groups represented on the KKL-JNF board, which includes international Jewish organizations and representatives from Israeli political parties, had been optimistic that they would be able to quash the measure, according to the Haaretz daily. But they were taken by surprise when the representative of Hadassah abstained and the representatives of Na’amat and Maccabi both voted in favor. Na’amat is a Jewish women’s organization affiliated with the Labor Zionist Movement and Maccabi is the international Jewish sports organization. The motion was then passed by a single vote. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms The left-wing Meretz faction, which had been hoping to delay the vote until after the election, said afterward that it would be filing for a repeat vote given the close results. A group of board members representing left-leaning factions subsequently filed a petition demanding that the vote be annulled. They cited malpractice by KKL-JNF chairman Avi Duvdevani, claiming he muted certain members on the Zoom meeting and prevented others from answering questions before rushing the vote. In addition, the petitioners claimed that legal opinions criticizing KKL-JNF’s covert conduct beyond the Green Line were hidden from board members. A picture taken on October 13, 2020, shows new housing construction in the Nokdim settlement in the West Bank, south of the Palestinian city of Bethlehem. (MENAHEM KAHANA / AFP) The question of KKL-JNF’s activity in the West Bank has sparked fierce debate, albeit mostly outside Israel, with liberal Diaspora Jewish groups more critical of the idea. Advertisement KKL-JNF has long relied on donations from abroad and Diaspora Jews have long associated the group with its little blue charity boxes and the planting of trees in Israel. But in the past two decades, KKL-JNF’s American branch has divorced itself almost entirely from the sister-Israeli organization and only goes by JNF, leading to a great deal of confusion among donors as to where their funds are being transferred, given that KKL-JNF’s activities beyond the Green Line have been more widespread. JNF also funds projects in the West Bank but only a limited number of them. What was voted on Thursday would take operations beyond the Green Line to another level by allowing KKL-JNF to purchase lands for the purpose of expanding settlements. A day before the vote, Blue and White’s representative on the board sent a letter to Duvdevani, urging him to postpone the matter to “avoid a national and international controversy at this sensitive time,” Haaretz reported. Duvdevani took over in the fall of 2020 and has been promoting the policy change. Duvdevani is a part of the right’s gradual growing influence over Zionist organizations like KKL. The move came in response to a push from pro-settlement lobbyists and the organization tried to keep it low-key. KKL-JNF chairman Avi Duvdevani (Amos Lozon/KKL-JNF) Rabbi Rick Jacobs, the head of the Union for Reform Judaism, the largest Jewish movement in North America, says KKL-JNF’s shift stems from recent elections at the World Zionist Congress that brought to power right-wing leaders more closely aligned with the Israeli government. His group and others that are opposed to settlements denounced the proposal. Jacobs is concerned the move could tar the KKL for many in the West or spark tensions with the new US administration, which is also opposed to settlement expansion. Advertisement KKL-JNF has operated in the West Bank in the past, but Jacobs noted that its activities dramatically dropped off over the last two decades before resuming and accelerating in secret in recent years. KKL-JNF, established in 1901 to buy and develop land for Jewish settlement and best known for the hundreds of millions of trees it has planted throughout Israel, serves as the Jewish people’s custodian for some 15 percent of the land in the country, the management of which is carried out by the Israel Lands Authority. A type of NGO officially registered as a company for the benefit of the public, KKL-JNF works in the fields of forestry, water, education, community development, tourism, and research and development. The World Zionist Organization is its parent body. The Climate Crisis and Responsible Journalism As The Times of Israel's environment reporter, I try to convey the facts and science behind climate change and environmental degradation, to explain - and critique - the official policies affecting our future, and to describe Israeli technologies that can form part of the solution. I am passionate about the natural world and disheartened by the dismal lack of awareness to environmental issues shown by most of the public and politicians in Israel. I'm proud to be doing my part to keep Times of Israel readers properly informed about this vital subject - which can and does effect policy change.

The first Jewish pioneers who came to the land of Israel towards the end of the twentieth century found a desolate land that provided no shade whatsoever. KKL-JNF has planted over 240,000,000 trees on an area of about 247,000 acres. Today, KKL-JNF is the only organization in Israel that is responsible for afforestation, as stipulated in the covenant signed between KKL-JNF and the state of Israel. KKL-JNF plants a variety of trees in Israel's forests – conifers, deciduous trees and fruit trees. Some of the trees are indigenous to this region and some are species that were brought to Israel from other countries.

As of 2014, it is the world's largest national development bank[3] and as of 2018 Germany’s third largest bank by balance sheet. Its name originally comes from Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (""Credit Institute for Reconstruction""). It was formed in 1948 after World War II as part of the Marshall Plan. Contents 1 Governance 2 Operations 3 Subsidiaries and group units 3.1 Housing and environment 3.2 Small and medium enterprises 3.3 Development aid 3.4 Export and project finance 3.5 State shareholding 3.6 Advisory services 4 Awards 5 Controversy 6 See also 7 References 8 External links Governance[edit] KfW is owned by the Federal Republic of Germany (80 percent) and the States of Germany (20 percent).[4] It is led by a five-member Executive Board headed by CEO Dr. Günther Bräunig,[5] which in turn reports to a 36 member Board of Supervisory Directors. The Chair and Deputy Chair of the Board of Supervisory Directors are the German Federal Ministers of Finance and of Economic Affairs, with the positions alternating annually between them. The chairman as of March 2018 is Peter Altmaier, Federal Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy.[6] In 2009, Caisse des Dépots, Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, KfW and European Investment Bank founded the Long-Term Investors Club.[7] Operations[edit] KfW banking group covers over 90% of its borrowing needs in the capital markets, mainly through bonds that are guaranteed by the federal government. This allows KfW to raise funds at advantageous conditions. Its exemption from having to pay corporate taxes due to its legal status as a public agency and unremunerated equity provided by its public shareholders allow KfW to provide loans for purposes prescribed by the KfW law at lower rates than commercial banks. KfW is not allowed to compete with commercial banks, but it facilitates their business in areas within its mandate. KfW banking group has three business units with distinct functions, as well as several subsidiaries. Lending by KfW group’s two main business units, accounting for more than 90% of total lending, is in Germany and, to a limited extent, in other European countries. However, its largest subsidiary, KfW IPEX-Bank GmbH, predominantly lends internationally. A smaller subsidiary, the German Investment Corporation (DEG), and one of the group’s smaller business units, KfW Development Bank, are exclusively active in the international arena, each within their particular business areas. Subsidiaries and group units[edit] Housing and environment[edit] KfW Förderbank (KfW promotional Bank), the largest business unit of the group, committed €47.6 billion in 2014, mostly for housing and environmental protection in Germany.[8] It is especially active in promoting energy-efficient housing for owner-occupied houses as well as for landlords, both for new houses and refurbishments.[9] Its energy efficiency standards for houses (KfW-60 and KfW-40) have become accepted standards in Germany. Concerning environmental protection, it promotes, among others, photovoltaic energy (solar cells) which has in turn received massive indirect subsidies through feed-in tariffs[10] under the Renewable Energy Law of 2000. It also invests in municipal infrastructure such as public transport and sanitation through a sub-unit called KfW Kommunalbank (KfW municipal bank). More recently (since 2006), it has also engaged in education where it provides student loans. Small and medium enterprises[edit] KfW Mittelstandsbank (which roughly translates as KfW small and medium enterprises bank), the second largest business unit of the group, provides assistance to German small and medium enterprises (SMEs) including individual entrepreneurs and start-ups. In addition to loans it also provides equity and mezzanine financing. Its financing totaled €20.4 billion in 2015. [11] KfW has been very active in securitization before this market collapsed during the subprime mortgage crisis. Through securitization it helped commercial banks to transfer risks from their housing and SME portfolios to the capital market. KfW also provides loans to European commercial banks to help them finance SMEs, housing and infrastructure (so-called global loans). Development aid[edit] KfW Entwicklungsbank (KfW Development Bank) provides financing to governments, public enterprises and commercial banks engaged in microfinance and SME promotion in developing countries. It does so through loans close to market terms using its own resources (""promotional loans""), soft loans that blend KfW resources with support from the federal government's aid budget (""development loans""), as well as highly subsidized loans and grants, the latter two coming entirely from the federal aid budget. Different country groups are offered different financing conditions depending mainly on their per capita income. All these financing instruments are part of what is officially called development cooperation and is more commonly called ""development aid"". In German aid, the work of KfW Development Bank is called ""financial cooperation"" which is complemented by ""technical cooperation"" by GIZ and other public agencies. The main sectors of financial cooperation are water supply and sanitation, renewable energy and energy efficiency, as well as the development of the financial sector. KfW Development Bank also works, among other sectors, in health, education, agriculture, forestry, solid waste management. It provided €7.4 billion in loans and grants in 2014.[8] Export and project finance[edit] The largest subsidiary of KfW banking group is KfW IPEX-Bank. KfW IPEX-Bank is active in project finance and corporate finance related to German or European exports. It also promotes foreign investments in Germany. Unlike KfW, it competes directly with commercial banks. Therefore, and in response to concerns voiced by the European Commission concerning unfair competition, KfW IPEX-Bank has become legally and financially independent in 2008. KfW IPEX-Bank's main sectors of activity are ports, airports, toll roads, bridges and tunnels, railways, ships, planes, telecommunications, energy, and manufacturing. In 2014 the balance sheet total of KfW IPEX-Bank amounted to €26.3 billion.[8] Another subsidiary of KfW banking group, the German Investment Corporation (DEG), takes minority equity stakes and provides loans to private companies investing in developing countries. It pursues a business model broadly similar to that of the International Finance Corporation of the World Bank Group. Its main sectors of activity are banking, agro-business, renewable energy, telecommunications and manufacturing. It lent 1.2 billion[clarification needed] in 2008.[8] State shareholding[edit] On behalf of the German state, KfW holds shares in a variety of corporations, including Deutsche Post, Deutsche Telekom,[12] Commerzbank, Lufthansa,[13] and CureVac.[14] Advisory services[edit] In 2013, KfW agreed to help establish a Portuguese financial institution to foster economic growth and boost job creation in the country.[15] Awards[edit] The magazine Global Finance rated KfW as the safest bank in the world in its ""World's 50 Safest Banks 2014"" rating. The rating was based on long-term foreign currency ratings from Fitch Ratings and Standard and Poor's and the long-term bank deposit ratings from Moody's Investors Service.[16] Controversy[edit] In September 2008, as investors were scrambling to get their funds out of Lehman Brothers, KfW accidentally wired 426 million[clarification needed] to Lehman; Germany's largest circulation newspaper, Bild, subsequently called KfW ""Germany's Dumbest Bank"" at the time.[17] The bank subsequently fired two board members over the transfer. Due to a glitch in the bank’s information technology, KfW again accidentally transferred 7.6 billion euros ($8.2 billion) to four other banks in February 2017 but got the money back, incurring costs of 25,000 euros.[18] See also[edit] Banks portal Reconstruction Finance Corporation (United States) List of development aid agencies References[edit] ^ a b c d e ""Key figures and financial reports"".

As of 2014, it is the world's largest national development bank[3] and as of 2018 Germany’s third largest bank by balance sheet. Its name originally comes from Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (""Credit Institute for Reconstruction""). It was formed in 1948 after World War II as part of the Marshall Plan. Contents 1 Governance 2 Operations 3 Subsidiaries and group units 3.1 Housing and environment 3.2 Small and medium enterprises 3.3 Development aid 3.4 Export and project finance 3.5 State shareholding 3.6 Advisory services 4 Awards 5 Controversy 6 See also 7 References 8 External links Governance[edit] KfW is owned by the Federal Republic of Germany (80 percent) and the States of Germany (20 percent).[4] It is led by a five-member Executive Board headed by CEO Dr. Günther Bräunig,[5] which in turn reports to a 36 member Board of Supervisory Directors. The Chair and Deputy Chair of the Board of Supervisory Directors are the German Federal Ministers of Finance and of Economic Affairs, with the positions alternating annually between them. The chairman as of March 2018 is Peter Altmaier, Federal Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy.[6] In 2009, Caisse des Dépots, Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, KfW and European Investment Bank founded the Long-Term Investors Club.[7] Operations[edit] KfW banking group covers over 90% of its borrowing needs in the capital markets, mainly through bonds that are guaranteed by the federal government. This allows KfW to raise funds at advantageous conditions. Its exemption from having to pay corporate taxes due to its legal status as a public agency and unremunerated equity provided by its public shareholders allow KfW to provide loans for purposes prescribed by the KfW law at lower rates than commercial banks. KfW is not allowed to compete with commercial banks, but it facilitates their business in areas within its mandate. KfW banking group has three business units with distinct functions, as well as several subsidiaries. Lending by KfW group’s two main business units, accounting for more than 90% of total lending, is in Germany and, to a limited extent, in other European countries. However, its largest subsidiary, KfW IPEX-Bank GmbH, predominantly lends internationally. A smaller subsidiary, the German Investment Corporation (DEG), and one of the group’s smaller business units, KfW Development Bank, are exclusively active in the international arena, each within their particular business areas. Subsidiaries and group units[edit] Housing and environment[edit] KfW Förderbank (KfW promotional Bank), the largest business unit of the group, committed €47.6 billion in 2014, mostly for housing and environmental protection in Germany.[8] It is especially active in promoting energy-efficient housing for owner-occupied houses as well as for landlords, both for new houses and refurbishments.[9] Its energy efficiency standards for houses (KfW-60 and KfW-40) have become accepted standards in Germany. Concerning environmental protection, it promotes, among others, photovoltaic energy (solar cells) which has in turn received massive indirect subsidies through feed-in tariffs[10] under the Renewable Energy Law of 2000. It also invests in municipal infrastructure such as public transport and sanitation through a sub-unit called KfW Kommunalbank (KfW municipal bank). More recently (since 2006), it has also engaged in education where it provides student loans. Small and medium enterprises[edit] KfW Mittelstandsbank (which roughly translates as KfW small and medium enterprises bank), the second largest business unit of the group, provides assistance to German small and medium enterprises (SMEs) including individual entrepreneurs and start-ups. In addition to loans it also provides equity and mezzanine financing. Its financing totaled €20.4 billion in 2015. [11] KfW has been very active in securitization before this market collapsed during the subprime mortgage crisis. Through securitization it helped commercial banks to transfer risks from their housing and SME portfolios to the capital market. KfW also provides loans to European commercial banks to help them finance SMEs, housing and infrastructure (so-called global loans). Development aid[edit] KfW Entwicklungsbank (KfW Development Bank) provides financing to governments, public enterprises and commercial banks engaged in microfinance and SME promotion in developing countries. It does so through loans close to market terms using its own resources (""promotional loans""), soft loans that blend KfW resources with support from the federal government's aid budget (""development loans""), as well as highly subsidized loans and grants, the latter two coming entirely from the federal aid budget. Different country groups are offered different financing conditions depending mainly on their per capita income. All these financing instruments are part of what is officially called development cooperation and is more commonly called ""development aid"". In German aid, the work of KfW Development Bank is called ""financial cooperation"" which is complemented by ""technical cooperation"" by GIZ and other public agencies. The main sectors of financial cooperation are water supply and sanitation, renewable energy and energy efficiency, as well as the development of the financial sector. KfW Development Bank also works, among other sectors, in health, education, agriculture, forestry, solid waste management. It provided €7.4 billion in loans and grants in 2014.[8] Export and project finance[edit] The largest subsidiary of KfW banking group is KfW IPEX-Bank. KfW IPEX-Bank is active in project finance and corporate finance related to German or European exports. It also promotes foreign investments in Germany. Unlike KfW, it competes directly with commercial banks. Therefore, and in response to concerns voiced by the European Commission concerning unfair competition, KfW IPEX-Bank has become legally and financially independent in 2008. KfW IPEX-Bank's main sectors of activity are ports, airports, toll roads, bridges and tunnels, railways, ships, planes, telecommunications, energy, and manufacturing. In 2014 the balance sheet total of KfW IPEX-Bank amounted to €26.3 billion.[8] Another subsidiary of KfW banking group, the German Investment Corporation (DEG), takes minority equity stakes and provides loans to private companies investing in developing countries. It pursues a business model broadly similar to that of the International Finance Corporation of the World Bank Group. Its main sectors of activity are banking, agro-business, renewable energy, telecommunications and manufacturing. It lent 1.2 billion[clarification needed] in 2008.[8] State shareholding[edit] On behalf of the German state, KfW holds shares in a variety of corporations, including Deutsche Post, Deutsche Telekom,[12] Commerzbank, Lufthansa,[13] and CureVac.[14] Advisory services[edit] In 2013, KfW agreed to help establish a Portuguese financial institution to foster economic growth and boost job creation in the country.[15] Awards[edit] The magazine Global Finance rated KfW as the safest bank in the world in its ""World's 50 Safest Banks 2014"" rating. The rating was based on long-term foreign currency ratings from Fitch Ratings and Standard and Poor's and the long-term bank deposit ratings from Moody's Investors Service.[16] Controversy[edit] In September 2008, as investors were scrambling to get their funds out of Lehman Brothers, KfW accidentally wired 426 million[clarification needed] to Lehman; Germany's largest circulation newspaper, Bild, subsequently called KfW ""Germany's Dumbest Bank"" at the time.[17] The bank subsequently fired two board members over the transfer. Due to a glitch in the bank’s information technology, KfW again accidentally transferred 7.6 billion euros ($8.2 billion) to four other banks in February 2017 but got the money back, incurring costs of 25,000 euros.[18] See also[edit] Banks portal Reconstruction Finance Corporation (United States) List of development aid agencies References[edit] ^ a b c d e ""Key figures and financial reports"".

The compendium is intended to be a “living resource” and to be periodically updated to incorporate new case studies of good practice. The compendium is structured around three main themes. The first theme includes case studies of good practices in promoting PPIF at the national level. The second theme covers case studies of good practices in promoting PPIF at the international level. The third theme consists of case studies of good practices regarding assessing the quality of PPIF. All three themes include case studies of government initiatives, NGO initiatives, and in some cases, the two working together. The second theme also includes case studies of initiatives taken by international forums themselves. Open invitation for further case studies The case studies included in the compendium to date are drawn from the work of the Task Force over the 2008-2011 intersessional period. However, in keeping with the compendium’s status as a “living resource”, new case studies of good practice in promoting public participation in international forums are always welcome. If you have a case study that you would like to include in the compendium, please send a short summary (under 800 words) to public.participation@unece.org, indicating in the subject line that it is intended as a contribution to the compendium. Case studies on promoting PPIF at the national level Government initiatives Georgia and the Ramsar Convention on the Conservation of Wetlands In collaboration with the Ramsar Convention secretariat, the Ministry of Environment Protection and Natural Resources of Georga designed an awareness campaign around the 41st meeting of the Standing Committee of the Ramsar Convention (Georgia, April 2010). Information was disseminated several months before the conference to raise public awareness regarding the importance of wetlands. All NGOs expressing interest were able to attend the conference and some more active NGOs participated in the awareness-raising campaign itself.  There was advertising for the conference on the main TV channels and a special film was prepared illustrating the importance of wetlands. Lectures and seminars for youth and students on wetlands protection were held as well as an exhibition of children’s drawings about wetlands. The government of Georgia provided discounts on hotels and free transport in the region for participants in the meeting, including NGO representatives. Armenia and the NGO contacts database The Armenian Ministry of Environment is implementing a project, with the assistance of the German government, to create a database to identify NGOs to be invited to consultations regarding environmental planning, policy and decision-making. The database will include NGOs’ main purposes and objectives, their areas of work, their donors etc. France and the Grenelle Environmental Debates The Grenelle Environmental Debates was a new political consultation process launched by France’s President in mid 2007. It resulted in unprecedented mobilization by civil society, with hundreds of proposals; 19 regional meetings with over 16,900 participants, 8 internet forums with 11,000 contributions; six working groups and roundtables and 268 commitments, of which 88% have been implemented. As well as national commitments, the process included commitments regarding three international processes – the climate negotiations, the 2010 year of biodiversity and the Rio +20 Conference in 2010. The Grenelle Committee meets regularly to follow up on the commitments. France and Envilogue In 2008, the French government launched the ENVILOGUE extranet environmental platform with the aim to enhance civil society involvement in environmental decision-making at the European Union (EU) and international levels. Other initiatives by the French government in the lead up to the Copenhagen conference included meetings with NGOs and selecting a youth delegation of four French students to take part in governmental meetings, EU coordination meetings and preliminary debates. Regarding media, the French government also set up a radio frequency for information regarding the climate change negotiations, and published many articles, photos and videos. NGO initiatives NGO contacts database – Environmental Public Advocacy Centre (Armenia) The Armenian NGO Environmental Public Advocacy Centre (EPAC) also has its own database of NGOs indicating their areas of expertise which EPAC uses when identifying invitation lists for events or other opportunities for input. National forums before and after international meetings - “Khazer” Ecological and Cultural NGO (Armenia) In the lead up to the Copenhagen conference, “Khazer” Ecological and Cultural NGO (Armenia) organized a national ecological forum and other meetings with representatives of different government departments, public institutions and NGOs, to discuss climate change issues and to contribute to Armenia’s position for dealing with climate change problems. Following the Copenhagen conference, “Khazer” Ecological and Cultural NGO organized a second national conference to discuss the Copenhagen conference and its outcomes. “Khazer” Ecological and Cultural NGO has also conducted research on the effects of the many new hydro-electric power stations that have been built as a result of “clean energy” policies, including effects on endemic species of fish, and the local people who rely on them for their livelihood. The Armenian government is now looking into this issue, with the involvement of civil society. Case studies on promoting PPIF at the international level International forum initiatives Workshop on access to information and public participation in water and health related issues – Water and Health Protocol On 15-16 June 2010, the UNECE and WECF organised a workshop on access to information and public participation in water and health related issues in Bucharest for Parties to the Protocol and NGOs. It is intended that a guidance paper on public participation will be developed from the outcomes of the workshop. A proposal was also made at the workshop to collaborate with the Aarhus Convention on public participation. Further information on the workshop is available at: http://www.unece.org/env/water/meetings/public_participation_protocol_workshop.htlm NGO seats on the bureau – Environment and Health Process The Environment and Health Process was launched in 1989 and since then ministerial conferences have been held every five years with many ways for civil society to be involved. For example, there are two seats on the Bureau for civil society (one environmental NGO and one health NGO representative, both representatives are elected). For further information see: http://www.euro.who.int/en/what-we-do/health-topics/environmental-health/european-process-on-environment-and-health Rotating leadership of major groups - CSD The involvement of civil society in the CSD is managed through the 9 major groups of Agenda 21 (women, children and youth, indigenous people, NGOs, local authorities, trade unions, business and industry, scientific and technological community, farmers). Participation rights for civil society include speaking slots, seats in round tables with ministers, the right to comment on the agenda and the right to nominate people from that group. A key challenge is the need for each major group to be self-organised. Ideally, this should be democractic, through the election of the key representatives. However, this does not always happen and issues of representativeness may arise. The “women” major group now has a rotating system in place so that every two years another NGO or group of NGOs will take the lead in accordance with the issues of that CSD cycle. This system is reported to encourage dynamism. Government initiatives NGO representatives on official delegations For a number of years, Italy has included an NGO representative on its climate change delegation. The NGO representative is duly engaged in preparatory meetings, before EU coordination meetings take place, and in the day-to-day work of the delegation during the negotiations' rounds. The representative also participates in NGO meetings on key topics, bringing back views and expertise from the NGOs' community, and so the government delegation has the possibility to benefit from this input. Coordination meetings with civil society before and during the conferences The Austrian climate change delegation has had a practice of organising daily meetings with civil society during UNFCCC conferences regarding what had happened that day, and what will happen the following day. NGO initiatives “Below 2C” bulletin A group of Russian NGOs began publishing the “Below 2C” bulletin before the UNFCCC CoP-14 in Poznan (December 2008). The Russian –language bulletin has two main functions: to inform the public and mass media about the international climate negotiations and to promote the NGO climate position. The bulletin is presently produced by representatives of a number of Russian NGOs involved in the UN climate talks. Due to interest from civil society from other regions, an English version of “Below 2C” was published during the CoP-15 in Copenhagen. In addition to the bulletin, there is now also a “Below 2C” blog, http://below2.ru The creators of “Below 2C” note that Russian-speaking government delegates have recognized the bulletin’s importance and now engage in dialogue with the NGOs involved. See:http://below2.ru Case studies on assessing PPIF Study on Austria’s practice regarding PPIF – Justice and Environment and Oekobuero, funded by Austrian Ministry of Environment In 2009, Justice and Environment and Oekobuero (Austria) undertook a research project to assess Austria’s practice regarding PPIF. The project was funded by the Austrian Ministry of Environment and was intended to raise awareness of the Almaty Guidelines in Austria and to develop recommendations for the better implementation of the Guidelines in the future. It included interviews with various Austrian focal points in the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and Austrian NGOs regarding various international forums. The outcomes of the research were presented at a stakeholder workshop which also developed recommendations for practitioners. The results of the project were distributed by newsletter and published in an Austrian environmental science journal. The study generated a number of recommendations for how PPIF might be improved, including: (a) International forums differ in their openness to public participation with some being relatively closed to NGOs and the public. If Aarhus Parties include NGOs in their national delegations to such forums, this might initiate a change in the culture of these forums, and other countries may start to follow suit. (b) The flow of information is a two way street. NGOs working on international forums often have good contacts with NGOs in other regions, and are able to share useful information with the government. (c) Officials who adopt an open approach to PPIF should share their experiences with officials working in other international forums. (d)  NGOs would like procedures and practices regarding PPIF to be more formalised, so that they do not depend on the will of the particular ministry or even individual official involved. This might be in the form of rules or guidelines at the national level. (e) With respect to access to information, early proactive distribution of information is required, eg through websites, newsletters (either electronic or hardcopy). It is also important to disseminate regular information on intersessional issues, e.g. through civil society briefings. Ministries should post at least basic information about the international forums in which they participate on their websites, with links to the websites of the international forums themselves. (f) Regarding public participation, NGOs would like early information as to upcoming events and issues to be discussed or decided. They would like governments to include them in coordination meetings before and during the meetings of international forums. By way of example, at UNFCCC CoP-15 (Copenhagen, December 2009), Austrian officials would meet with NGOs each day. In general, they would like to be included in national delegations for international delegations. Financial support for NGOs is an important prerequisite to their participation. Better access to EU coordination meetings is considered key by European NGOs. Study of French negotiators’ practices regarding PPIF – France In 2007, the French Ministry of Ecology and Sustainable Development and Planning (MEDAD) undertook a study to assess negotiators’ practices regarding public participation in international decision-making processes and to compare NGOs’ and the focal points’ perceptions on this issue. The study, inter alia, considered: - The conditions under which French negotiators and delegations organise public participation in their preparation of French positions; - The conditions under which France, when present in international environmental bodies, ensures that the Aarhus principles on public consultation are applied; - The extent to which members of the French public feel they effectively contribute to the work of international bodies. The study’s findings were drawn from 29 interviews (22 focal points and 7 NGO/ private sector associations). The study’s findings concluded with a number of recommendations regarding possible enhancements to promote access to information and public participation in international forums by France. The study found that France has a key role in the promotion of public participation in international bodies and should do more to encourage it. Focal points and civil society representatives both recognised that greater formalism is required in the State/civil society relationship. Collaboration should become the rule rather than the exception. Possible improvements during the preparation of the national position include: a) Communicating a schedule to the public regarding the different stages of international processes to give a precise framework for dialogue; b) Making public consultation processes more systematic within appropriate time-frames so that the public representation can adopt a more constructive approach with fuller information on positions to be defended by the French delegation. In this respect, the representatives of civil society agreed on the importance of allocating more resources to MEDAD; c) Developing in-depth consultation between delegations and the public to enable proposals on new subjects going beyond simple reactions to documents drafted by the secretariats of the Conventions; d) Guaranteeing that the results of consultation procedures are taken into account in a way that goes beyond the barriers of formal consultation; e) Carrying out consultations with a large number of public representatives and giving credit to alternative expert analyses proposed by the public during consultation; f) Making it clearer to the public the responsibilities of the different ministries (in particular, the ecology ministry, MEDAD, and the foreign affairs ministry, MAEE) so as to improve working methods and resources. To this end, a “French inter-ministerial coordination secretariat” could be set up. This would allow relations with the public to be co-ordinated so as to prepare international milestones in a regular, properly-monitored manner. Also, to ensure improved visibility of the final national position after consultation, to ensure high-quality monitoring and participation during the later stages of the decision-making process. As a corollary of successful public participation, possible improvements to access to information and communication are as follows: a) Adopting a more “proactive” attitude to communication, in particular for conventions concerning relatively technical themes or targeting the populations directly concerned. b) Building financial capacities (in order, for example, to promote transversal communication between the various conventions), and human resources (with a view to establishing an active relay of information, ensuring its quality and improving the clarity and accessibility of mechanisms used); c) Highlight and promote the role of NGOs in disseminating information to the general public on the themes and challenges of major international negotiations. In this respect, some representatives of civil society recommend more aid to NGOs, for example by continuing to support tax measures which promote NGO membership. To promote public participation during international meetings, the following improvements could be considered: a) Improve timing of receipt of preparatory documents sent by convention secretariats; b) Rethink forms of NGO funding and look into the possibility of creating a fund to finance French NGO work internationally, in particular to cover travel; c) Get civil society representatives more involved in the follow up to international meetings. The study is available here Access to information and public participation in the development and implementation  of the European Neighbourhood Policy – RAC “Society and Environment”, Ukraine In 2008-2009, the NGO ""Society and Environment"" (Ukraine), with partner organizations from Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Moldova, undertook country assessments of the implementation of the environmental dimension of a number of national Action Plans agreed between the EU and neighbouring countries under the EU’s European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP). The assessments, inter alia, considered the extent to which access to information and public participation was ensured in the development and implementation of the ENP. For example, in respect of its country assessment of Ukraine, the study identified a number of deficiencies with respect to both access to information and public participation regarding both the original Action Plan, in place until 2009, and the more recent Association Agenda and Association Agreement which replaced it. The study also looked at access to information and public participation regarding the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI) (the framework for planning and delivering EU financial assistance to neighbouring countries). With respect to Ukraine, the study found there is limited access to the programming documents and no data is available to show what the financial assistance received was spent on.  Key documents are not available in Ukrainian language. While there were some opportunities for the public to participate in the mid-term review of the Country Strategy Papers and regarding the National Indicative Programme 2011-2013, there were no opportunities for participation regarding the annual action programs or to monitor the programming process. Overall, the study concluded that there is a need for increased awareness and more dialogue between the EU, Eastern ENP countries and NGOs regarding the ENP and ENPI. The study concluded that further opportunities for public participation were needed in the adoption, implementation and monitoring of the ENP as well as greater transparency in the planning, implementation and monitoring of the ENPI. ↑ Print this page © United Nations Economic Commission for Europe | Terms of Use | Privacy Notice|",Khazer Ecological and Cultural NGO

Its aim is to change the actions of individuals, and make Japanese society—including the industries, economies, energy systems, lifestyles, regions—fair, peaceful, stable, and sustainable (“Our Mission…” 2021). Kiko Network is funded by memberships, donations, grants, honorariums, contracts, and sales for approximately 97,607,593 yen per year (“Annual Reports”, 2020). With one office in Tokyo and one office in Kyoto, they employ 10 regular staff members and 16 board members (“地球…” 2021).Kiko Network has a sizable presence in many aspects of climate action. It is currently serving as the secretariat for Climate Action Network (CAN) Japan, which is coordinating a Renewable Energy 100% Platform in the country that encourages organizations and local governments to pledge to go carbon neutral. By the end of 2019, the platform gained 110 supporting organizations and pledges from 16 organizations (“Annual Reports”, 2020). In particular, Kiko Network’s major project is researching the effectiveness of the government’s climate policies such as the Energy savings law, The Climate Change Countermeasure Plan, The Basic Energy Plan, and the Japan Business Federation Voluntary Action Plan.To make climate policies and knowledge more accessible, they have also organized seminars and symposiums with experts to present its research on decarbonization scenarios and visions for Japan. Kiko Network also places an emphasis on youth and citizenship education through educational programs like the “Children’s Eco-Life Challenge” and the “Essay for Future“ competition that have been held annually for nearly ten years.Kiko Network could further scale-up Japan’s mission of “climate policy making process that emphasizes information disclosure and citizen participation” by focusing on incorporating youth voices into their policy recommendations. Perhaps by lending their support to grassroot, youth activist groups in the country, more people can be further trained to develop care for climate policies being conceived.Contact Shinjiro Koizumi, Minister of Environment Tel: +81-3-3581-3351 Address: No. 5 Godochosha, 1-2-2 Kasumigaseki, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo 100-8975Citations Annual Reports.

Win Gold Lose Coal Greenwashing the Tokyo Games Gold Sponsors funding coal Competing in a hotter world Japan and coal Blog Reports For Media Take Action Contact us Apr 5, 2020						 - By Kiko Network Kiko Network files first ever climate resolution in Japan Kiko Network, as a Mizuho Financial Group (Mizuho FG) shareholder, filed a resolution on 13 March calling on Mizuho FG to disclose its climate risks, and publish a plan to ensure its investments align with the goal of the Paris Agreement. This resolution is to be discussed at the Mizuho’s 18th shareholder meetings, which will be held in coming June. About the proposal It is proposed that the following provision be added to the Articles of incorporation: Noting the company’s support for the Paris Agreement and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), the company shall disclose in its annual reporting a plan outlining the company’s business strategy, including metrics and targets, to align its investments with the goals of the Paris Agreement. Mizuho FG is one of the largest global lenders to coal developers. Although its current coal policy states that investment should be limited to coal-fired power plants using the ultra-supercritical (USC) technology, there are loopholes that allow Mizuhoto stay involved to projects like the Vung Ang 2 in Vietnam, while funding other project  inside and outside of Japan. Under the urgency of transition to “decarbonization” as response to the climate change – which makes a serious impact to the world – continuing to invest in coal related business not only exposes the company to risk of climate change, but also degrade corporate value and eventually increases risk to investors. To avoid those risks in the future, Kiko Network requires  Mizuho FG to formulate and disclose management strategies, including benchmarks and targets for investing in line with the Paris Agreement. In Europe and the United States, more and more financial institutions are withdrawing from or reducing a size of investment for coal related business. In Asia, DBS Bank and OCBC (Overseas Chinese Banking Corporation) in Singapore,  UOB (United Overseas Bank) and others have announced that they withdraw their support for coal-fired power generations. It is obvious that Japan’s three mega-banks, including Mizuho FG, are completely behind the global “decarbonization” movement. We will be watching the next movements of Mizuho FG as the respond to this resolution.

231,"Japan’s Kiko Network: a new ally in opposition to an Oakland coal terminal – No Coal in Oakland No Coal in Oakland Home About Our Campaign Our Friends & Allies Our Staff News Events Take Action Donate to No Coal in Oakland Learn More Court Documents – OBOT versus the City of Oakland Jobs – Facts & Fiction Health & Safety Environmental Justice Q & A Videos Media Reports & Commentary Online Resources for Researching the Proposed Coal Terminal Archive Contact Japan’s Kiko Network: a new ally in opposition to an Oakland coal terminal No Coal in Oakland May 10, 2020 No Coal in Oakland has recently begun working with Japan’s Kiko Network, following discovery earlier this year that Insight Terminal Solutions (ITS) was pursuing a commitment from Japan’s largest energy company, JERA, to purchase 4 million tons of Utah coal per year. ITS, as we learned from the company’s bankruptcy court filings, is also pursuing financing from a Japanese bank, SMBC, for construction of a coal terminal in Oakland through which coal would be shipped to Japan. The Kiko Network introduced NCIO to its community last month, in an article published in English and Japanese. We are introducing Kiko Network to our community through this article that they have written for us. Kiko Network is a Japanese non-governmental, non-profit organization working to tackle climate change with initiatives on the local, national, and international levels. A primary focus of Kiko Network’s activities is on hastening Japan’s transition to renewable energy by preventing the expansion of coal power, the largest source of Japan’s CO2 emissions. In response to the Fukushima nuclear disaster of 2011, Japan made plans to construct a number of new coal-fired power plants throughout the country and has included coal as a major source of its baseload electricity. While governments, financial institutions, and corporations around the world are beginning to move away from coal, Japan continues to promote the utilization of coal power, leading the expansion of coal power throughout Asia while remaining the world’s third largest importer of coal. In recent years, Kiko Network has been focusing on stopping new coal-fired power projects, including new projects by JERA, Japan’s leading thermal power generation company. JERA has maintained coal-fired power generation as an important part of its business strategy and domestic energy policy, and has also supported the construction of controversial coal-fired power plants overseas. One of the key projects targeted in Kiko Network’s activities is the construction of two new coal-fired generating units at JERA’s Yokosuka thermal power plant. This includes assisting residents of Tokyo Bay in running local campaigns and proceeding with their litigation against the project. Additionally, Kiko Network has been pressuring JERA to cancel the construction of their other planned coal-fired power projects in Japan, such as the Taketoyo thermal power plant in Aichi Prefecture, which has already begun construction. Kiko Network’s actions also include putting pressure on megabanks and financial institutions to end their financing for coal. In March 2020, Kiko Network filed the first ever climate-based shareholder resolution to a Japanese publicly-traded company, calling for Mizuho Financial Group to disclose its climate risks and publish a plan to ensure its investments align with the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement. After its submission, some of Mizuho’s shareholders expressed support for the resolution. In April 2020, Mizuho announced that it would strengthen its coal finance policy, and Kiko Network continues to push Mizuho to ensure their investments are aligned with the Paris goals. Kiko Network is working to achieve the same goals as No Coal in Oakland, and we fully support their activities. JERA and SMBC should decline to finance construction of a coal terminal in Oakland, and cancel any commitments or plans to purchase coal shipped from the proposed Oakland Bulk and Oversized Terminal.

Read our Editor's note on how we're helping professionals make smart decisions.Read moreSkip to main contentWorldBusinessLegal MarketsMoreSign InRegisterMenuJune 29, 20215:17 AM UTCLast Updated agoAsia PacificMUFG board beats back climate resolution as activists falter in JapanBy Aaron Sheldrick and Takashi Umekawa2 minute readPeople queue inside a branch of the Mitsubishi UFJ (MUFJ) Financial Group's bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in Tokyo, Japan, February 1, 2016. REUTERS/Yuya Shino/File PhotoTOKYO, June 29 (Reuters) - Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (8306.T) shareholders on Tuesday defeated a proposal for the bank to align its business with global targets on climate change, dealing a win for the board over investors pushing for more action on the environment.Activist investors in Europe and the United States trying to halt climate change have successfully compelled companies to divest their fossil fuel holdings but the tactic has failed in Japan so far. This is the fourth time since 2020 a so-called shareholder climate resolution has been defeated after being brought before a Japanese listed company.Japanese boards have benefited from the backing of domestic institutional investors that tend to defer to management.Mitsubishi UFJ is Japan's biggest lender and backs numerous coal and fossil fuel projects.A Mitsubishi UFJ spokesperson confirmed via email that the resolution failed during its annual general meeting, garnering about 23% of the shareholder vote.Mitsubishi UFJ's board opposed the resolution saying the ""essential content"" of the proposal ""has already been incorporated into the company's management strategies,"" with a recent carbon neutrality pledge and other policy changes.Non-governmental organizations Kiko Network and Rainforest Action Network offered the resolution, supported by a number of shareholders, including EOS at Federated Hermes, which focuses on sustainable investing.""While we welcome the recent updates to the company's policies and the net zero commitment for 2050, we do not believe these are sufficiently aligned to limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius,"" Sachi Suzuki, associated director for engagement at EOS at Federated Hermes, said in an email.The 2015 Paris Agreement requires countries to curb carbon emissions enough to keep average temperature rises to within 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) of pre-industrial levels to avert the worst effects of climate change.Mizuho Financial Group (8411.T) was the first Japanese listed company to face a climate resolution, with shareholders last year voting it down. In the last two weeks, Sumitomo (8053.T) and Kansai Electric Power (9503.T) have fended off similar resolutions. read more (This story refiles to change headline to say MUFG not MUFJ)Reporting by Takashi Umekawa and Aaron Sheldrick; Editing by Christian SchmollingerOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.More from ReutersSign up for our newsletterSubscribe for our daily curated newsletter to receive the latest exclusive Reuters coverage delivered to your inbox.Sign upAsia PacificAsia Pacific · 7:22 AM UTCAustralia pandemic panel backs reopening targets despite Sydney outbreakAustralia can proceed with its reopening plans when the country reaches 70%-80% vaccination levels, the government's pandemic modelling adviser said, even as some states hinted they may not ease border curbs if Sydney fails to control its Delta outbreak.Asia PacificNew Zealand COVID-19 Delta outbreak spreading rapidly as cases jump8:11 AM UTCAsia PacificU.S. scraps plan to use S.Korea, Japan bases for Afghan refugees -sources10:55 AM UTCAsia PacificParalympics set to open in Tokyo amid worsening COVID-19 crisis4:04 PM UTCAsia PacificMore than 4,000 U.S. passport holders plus families evacuated from Afghanistan -State Dept official7:26 PM UTCBrowseWorldBusinessLegalMarketsBreakingviewsTechnologyInvestigationsLifestyleAbout ReutersAbout ReutersCareersReuters News AgencyBrand Attribution GuidelinesReuters LeadershipReuters Fact CheckReuters Diversity ReportStay InformedDownload the AppNewslettersInformation you can trustReuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world’s largest multimedia news provider, reaching billions of people worldwide every day.

We saw that many kids were not going to school because they were sick from drinking contaminated water, living under poor sanitary conditions or running around barefoot all day. As a result, our projects are now centered around making sure kids have the vital basics to go to school healthy by providing them with safe drinking water, better sanitation, shoes and, a bike or two when necessary. In addition, we are also having our students think of more innovative ways to rid Cambodia of terrible land mines which continue to maim children and adults. Yes, they are still around!

In 2020 KAPSARC was ranked by the University of Pennsylvania Think Tank and Civil Societies Program as 13th place out of 60th in its list of global top Energy and Resource Policy think tanks and jumped up 14th spots in the MENA Think Tank index, to reach 15th out of 103.[2] Contents 1 History 2 Governance 3 Campus 4 Research initiatives and publications 5 Awards 6 KAPSARC and G20 6.1 KAPSARC and T20 7 Partners 8 Gallery 9 See also 10 References 11 External links History[edit] KAPSARC was inaugurated by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Salman in 2016,[3] KAPSARC's activities are funded in perpetuity by an endowment provided by the Government of Saudi Arabia.[4] Governance[edit] KAPSARC's Board of Trustees has controlling authority over the center's affairs, policies and governance. Chaired by the Minister of Energy (HRH Prince Abdilaziz Bin Salman Al-Saud), it comprises the president, three international members and three Saudi members.[5] The center is supported by the International Advisory Council (IAC), a group of globally recognized energy thought leaders who advise the center on its ongoing projects.[6] The IAC meets once a year and consists of several members of national, regional and international stature, such as Majid Al-Moneef, Turki Al-Saud, Jin-Yong Cai, Daniel Yergin, Sunita Narain, Richard Newell, Adnan Shihab-Eldin and others.[7] The endowment of the center enables researchers to conduct independent, objective research without the need to raise capital and without pressure from external donors. Campus[edit] The KAPSARC campus on the northern edge of Riyadh contains both a Residential Campus (called the REC, located on the west side) and a Research and Office Complex (called the ROC, on the east side).[8] The 70,000 square meters[9] Research and Office Complex was designed by Zaha Hadid, and supported by Event Communications.[10][11] Hadid received the commission after a 2009 design competition. It opened in October 2017[12] and received a LEED Platinum certification. The complex consists of five interlocking buildings, a research center, a computer center, a conference center, a library and the Musalla, a place for prayer.[13] Research initiatives and publications[edit] In 2019, KAPSARC created four new energy-economics products during aiming to highlight the hottest topics locally and globally. The new products are seeking to support decision-makers to reach Vision 2030 goals by providing pivotal insights and recommendations to ensure energy security, diversify economic resources, and curb climate change.[14] The center also issued five podcasts, 20 Instant Insights, nine Commentaries, and 12 open models and tools, seeking to discuss new challenges in the areas of economy, water, energy, environment, and technology, with analysis and solutions by the center's researchers. One of its flagship models is called the KAPSARC Energy Model (KEM).[15] In 2019 the center's publications in 10 initiatives – including energy, economy, oil, electricity, transportation, and climate change – rose by 32.5% compared with 2018, from 86 to 114 studies.[16] KAPSARC focused on 10 key initiatives, which include: evaluation of public investment projects; future of transport and fuel demand; future of energy, oil and gas markets; climate change; electricity sector transition;, economic diversification, energy and economic vulnerability and models, data, and tools. The center introduced more than 1250 open access models and research tools to advance the understanding of energy economics and environment policy pathways.[17] Awards[edit] Since KAPSARC's inauguration, the center received five awards highlighting the architecture and engineering of the center: LEED Platinum Certified Global Best Project of the Year in the category of education and research buildings, presented by ENR Engineering News-Record World Architecture Community Award Described by New York Times® as Environmental Beauty and Efficiency Saudi Arabia's “Smartest Building” in the Honeywell® smart building award.[18] KAPSARC and G20[edit] KAPSARC has been working alongside the Saudi G20 Secretariat on programs that are associated with the G20 Summit that will be hosted in Riyadh in 2020. The Think 20 (T20) Engagement Group provides research-based policy advice, facilitates interaction and communicates with the broader public on important issues related to the G20 nations that represent 85% of the world's economy and 75% of the global population. KAPSARC represented Saudi Arabia at the T20 summit in Buenos Aires in September 2018 and participated in the T20 inception meeting for 2019 that was held in Tokyo in December 2018.[19] KAPSARC and T20[edit] KAPSARC and the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies (KFCRIS) held the Think20 (T20) Inception Conference in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on January 19–20, 2020[20] The T20 is an engagement group that contributes to the G20 by providing research-based policy recommendations to the G20. The T20 communiqué presents vital policy recommendations developed by T20 Saudi Arabia task forces for consideration by the Leaders of G20 member countries during their summit in Riyadh in November 2020.[21] The Inception Conference convened more than 150 institutions and think tanks, and over 550 attendees from 65 countries,[22] to discuss a range of essential issues covering climate and energy, women and youth, innovation and technology, multilateralism, economic development and finance, food security and access to water. Partners[edit] KAPSARC has the strength of its international ties with more than 24 research institutes, public policy organizations and government institutions worldwide. Its collaborations allow it to further enrich its research output. They include: King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy (KSA) King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KSA) Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research Ministry of Economy and Planning (KSA) Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (KSA) Saudi Aramco (KSA) Saudi Electricity Company (KSA) Saudi Standards, Metrology and Quality Organization (KSA) TERI University (India) The Energy and Resources Institute (India) World Bank Arabian Gulf University (Bahrain) Atlantic Council (United States) Center for Strategic and International Studies (United States) China National Petroleum Corporation – Institute of Economics and Technology China Sustainable Transport Center Derasat (Bahrain) Electricity and Cogeneration Regulatory Authority (KSA) Energy Research Institute of the NDRC (China) Gulf Cooperation Council Interconnection Authority (KSA) Imperial College (United Kingdom) Khalifa University of Science and Technology (UAE) The center has also signed an MOU with SEC,[23] GCCIA[24] and ECRA[25] to develop the future of electricity in the kingdom and optimize electricity trade between GCC and MENA countries.

KAPSARC develops policies and economic frameworks that reduce the environmental impact and overall costs of energy supply and enable practical technology-based solutions to use energy more efficiently. Photo by Hufton+Crow Photo by Hufton+Crow Photo by Hufton+Crow Photo by Hufton+Crow Photo by Hufton+Crow Photo by Hufton+Crow Photo by Hufton+Crow Photo by Hufton+Crow Photo by Hufton+Crow Photo by Hufton+Crow Photo by Hufton+Crow Photo by Hufton+Crow Photo by Hufton+Crow Photo by Hufton+Crow Photo by Hufton+Crow Photo by Hufton+Crow Photo by Hufton+Crow Photo by Hufton+Crow Photo by Hufton+Crow Photo by Hufton+Crow Photo by Hufton+Crow Collaborating with international research centres, public policy organisations, worldwide government institutions and global industry, KAPSARC brings together leading experts from around the world to tackle energy challenges; freely sharing its knowledge, insights and analytical frameworks. The 70,000m² KAPSARC campus incorporates five buildings: the Energy Knowledge Centre; the Energy Computer Centre; a Conference Centre with exhibition hall and 300-seat auditorium; a Research Library with archives for 100,000 volumes; and the Musalla, an inspirational place for prayer within the campus. KAPSARC’s design has solid technical and environmental considerations at its heart, drawing the five elements of the campus into a unified whole. ZHA’s first project to be awarded LEED Platinum certification by the US Green Building Council, the centre is designed in response to the environmental conditions of the Riyadh Plateau to minimise energy and resource consumption. The primary organising strategy of the design is a cellular, partially modular system that integrates different departmental buildings as a single ensemble with interconnecting public spaces. Hexagonal prismatic honeycomb structures use the least material to create a lattice of cells within a given volume. This structural and organisational principle determined KAPSARC’s composition as an amalgamation of crystalline forms that emerges from the desert landscape, evolving to best respond to the environmental conditions and internal programme requirements. The honeycomb grid is compressed towards its central axis as an extension of the natural wadi that runs to the west. A research centre is by its very nature a forward-looking institution and KAPSARC’s architecture also looks to the future with a formal composition that can be expanded or adapted without compromising the centre’s visual character. The modular design generates consistent organisational, spatial and structural strategies that drive all elements of the plan. The six sides of the hexagonal cells also offer greater opportunities for increased connectivity when compared to rectangular cells with only four sides. KAPSARC’s five buildings differ in size and organisation to best suit their use. Each building is divided into its component functions and can be adapted to respond to changes in requirements or working methods. Additional cells can readily be introduced by extending KAPSARC’s honeycomb grid for future expansion of the research campus. The specific arrangement and form of KAPSARC’s buildings contribute to softening the strong light and heat of the Riyadh Plateau. The buildings of the campus surround a large public courtyard shaded by canopies supported from a forest of crafted steel columns. Presenting a solid, protecting shell to the harsh sunlight from the south, the KAPSARC campus opens to north and west; encouraging prevailing winds from the north to cool the courtyard during temperate months and facilitating connections with any future expansion of the campus to the north, as well as creating connections with the researcher’s residential community to the west. Privileging the pedestrian, each of the buildings within the campus is entered through this central public courtyard that also serves as a meeting space and link between buildings during temperate seasons. An underground link also connects the main buildings on the campus for use at the hottest times of the year. With its strong, protective shell on the exterior that shields from the extremes in weather, KAPSARC’s architecture is porous within. Specific hexagonal cells strategically located within each building are left open to create a series of sheltered courtyards that bring softly-controlled daylight into the interior. Orientated for the sun and wind conditions, the crystalline forms of the prismatic architectural cells gain in height towards the south, west, and east to shield internal spaces from direct sunlight, while the courtyards within are oriented to the north and northwest to bring indirect sunlight into the spaces below. ‘Wind-catchers’ integrated within the roof profiles on the southern sides of each courtyard catch the prevailing winds from the north, cooling each courtyard. KAPSARC’s architecture promotes transparency and encourages an active exchange between researchers and visitors. By strategically off-setting floorplates, spatial layering effects are created throughout the centre to provide views to the floors above and below; offering transparency between floors in public areas designed as collective zones for researchers to meet informally and exchange ideas. Secure areas and rooms requiring privacy are located within areas of each building where floorplates overlap. KAPSARC was awarded LEED Platinum certification from the United States Green Building Council (USGBC) through its application of passive and active solutions including: A 45% reduction in energy performance (compared to the ASHRAE baseline standards) achieved via KAPSARC’s building massing and orientation, façade optimisation, system selection and the solar PV array located on the roof of the south-facing Conference Centre with a capacity of 5,000MWh/year. All KAPSARC’s potable water is recycled and reused on site and 100% of irrigation water is from non-potable sources. 40% of KAPSARC’s construction materials have been sourced from within 500 miles, and 30% of materials made with recycled content. 98% of all wood certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). 4,000 tonnes of waste separated and diverted from landfill. KAPSARC has also been named Saudi Arabia’s ‘smartest’ building in the Honeywell Smart Building Awards programme. Based on criteria that include environmental sustainability, safety and productivity, KAPSARC received outstanding scores across all three categories. As a forum of innovation and collective research, KAPSARC’s convention centre recently hosted its first major public conference, with more than 20,000 visitors attending Saudi Design Week 2017.

In 2020 KAPSARC was ranked by the University of Pennsylvania Think Tank and Civil Societies Program as 13th place out of 60th in its list of global top Energy and Resource Policy think tanks and jumped up 14th spots in the MENA Think Tank index, to reach 15th out of 103.[2] Contents 1 History 2 Governance 3 Campus 4 Research initiatives and publications 5 Awards 6 KAPSARC and G20 6.1 KAPSARC and T20 7 Partners 8 Gallery 9 See also 10 References 11 External links History[edit] KAPSARC was inaugurated by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Salman in 2016,[3] KAPSARC's activities are funded in perpetuity by an endowment provided by the Government of Saudi Arabia.[4] Governance[edit] KAPSARC's Board of Trustees has controlling authority over the center's affairs, policies and governance. Chaired by the Minister of Energy (HRH Prince Abdilaziz Bin Salman Al-Saud), it comprises the president, three international members and three Saudi members.[5] The center is supported by the International Advisory Council (IAC), a group of globally recognized energy thought leaders who advise the center on its ongoing projects.[6] The IAC meets once a year and consists of several members of national, regional and international stature, such as Majid Al-Moneef, Turki Al-Saud, Jin-Yong Cai, Daniel Yergin, Sunita Narain, Richard Newell, Adnan Shihab-Eldin and others.[7] The endowment of the center enables researchers to conduct independent, objective research without the need to raise capital and without pressure from external donors. Campus[edit] The KAPSARC campus on the northern edge of Riyadh contains both a Residential Campus (called the REC, located on the west side) and a Research and Office Complex (called the ROC, on the east side).[8] The 70,000 square meters[9] Research and Office Complex was designed by Zaha Hadid, and supported by Event Communications.[10][11] Hadid received the commission after a 2009 design competition. It opened in October 2017[12] and received a LEED Platinum certification. The complex consists of five interlocking buildings, a research center, a computer center, a conference center, a library and the Musalla, a place for prayer.[13] Research initiatives and publications[edit] In 2019, KAPSARC created four new energy-economics products during aiming to highlight the hottest topics locally and globally. The new products are seeking to support decision-makers to reach Vision 2030 goals by providing pivotal insights and recommendations to ensure energy security, diversify economic resources, and curb climate change.[14] The center also issued five podcasts, 20 Instant Insights, nine Commentaries, and 12 open models and tools, seeking to discuss new challenges in the areas of economy, water, energy, environment, and technology, with analysis and solutions by the center's researchers. One of its flagship models is called the KAPSARC Energy Model (KEM).[15] In 2019 the center's publications in 10 initiatives – including energy, economy, oil, electricity, transportation, and climate change – rose by 32.5% compared with 2018, from 86 to 114 studies.[16] KAPSARC focused on 10 key initiatives, which include: evaluation of public investment projects; future of transport and fuel demand; future of energy, oil and gas markets; climate change; electricity sector transition;, economic diversification, energy and economic vulnerability and models, data, and tools. The center introduced more than 1250 open access models and research tools to advance the understanding of energy economics and environment policy pathways.[17] Awards[edit] Since KAPSARC's inauguration, the center received five awards highlighting the architecture and engineering of the center: LEED Platinum Certified Global Best Project of the Year in the category of education and research buildings, presented by ENR Engineering News-Record World Architecture Community Award Described by New York Times® as Environmental Beauty and Efficiency Saudi Arabia's “Smartest Building” in the Honeywell® smart building award.[18] KAPSARC and G20[edit] KAPSARC has been working alongside the Saudi G20 Secretariat on programs that are associated with the G20 Summit that will be hosted in Riyadh in 2020. The Think 20 (T20) Engagement Group provides research-based policy advice, facilitates interaction and communicates with the broader public on important issues related to the G20 nations that represent 85% of the world's economy and 75% of the global population. KAPSARC represented Saudi Arabia at the T20 summit in Buenos Aires in September 2018 and participated in the T20 inception meeting for 2019 that was held in Tokyo in December 2018.[19] KAPSARC and T20[edit] KAPSARC and the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies (KFCRIS) held the Think20 (T20) Inception Conference in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on January 19–20, 2020[20] The T20 is an engagement group that contributes to the G20 by providing research-based policy recommendations to the G20. The T20 communiqué presents vital policy recommendations developed by T20 Saudi Arabia task forces for consideration by the Leaders of G20 member countries during their summit in Riyadh in November 2020.[21] The Inception Conference convened more than 150 institutions and think tanks, and over 550 attendees from 65 countries,[22] to discuss a range of essential issues covering climate and energy, women and youth, innovation and technology, multilateralism, economic development and finance, food security and access to water. Partners[edit] KAPSARC has the strength of its international ties with more than 24 research institutes, public policy organizations and government institutions worldwide. Its collaborations allow it to further enrich its research output. They include: King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy (KSA) King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KSA) Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research Ministry of Economy and Planning (KSA) Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (KSA) Saudi Aramco (KSA) Saudi Electricity Company (KSA) Saudi Standards, Metrology and Quality Organization (KSA) TERI University (India) The Energy and Resources Institute (India) World Bank Arabian Gulf University (Bahrain) Atlantic Council (United States) Center for Strategic and International Studies (United States) China National Petroleum Corporation – Institute of Economics and Technology China Sustainable Transport Center Derasat (Bahrain) Electricity and Cogeneration Regulatory Authority (KSA) Energy Research Institute of the NDRC (China) Gulf Cooperation Council Interconnection Authority (KSA) Imperial College (United Kingdom) Khalifa University of Science and Technology (UAE) The center has also signed an MOU with SEC,[23] GCCIA[24] and ECRA[25] to develop the future of electricity in the kingdom and optimize electricity trade between GCC and MENA countries.

The project successfully identified key opportunities and challenges in improving existing energy balances compiled by reputable international organizations. Read more Energy Balance App Crude Oil Storage Cost CrudeStore App This model represents a spread option-based formulation that adds a locational dimension to the conventional storage theory and is based on the prices of crude oil at two different locations, factoring in costs of storage and transportation, and the time required to transport oil between them. This methodology offers a viable alternative to the traditional cost of carry approach; it can also estimate implied convenience yields and the shadow price of inventories, aiding commodity trading strategies. The three key drivers of inventories—the cost of carry, convenience yield and spread option value—are estimated for eight primary international crude oil storage hubs located at major seaports using daily data from December 21, 2015 to January 25, 2019.

In 2020 KAPSARC was ranked by the University of Pennsylvania Think Tank and Civil Societies Program as 13th place out of 60th in its list of global top Energy and Resource Policy think tanks and jumped up 14th spots in the MENA Think Tank index, to reach 15th out of 103.[2] Contents 1 History 2 Governance 3 Campus 4 Research initiatives and publications 5 Awards 6 KAPSARC and G20 6.1 KAPSARC and T20 7 Partners 8 Gallery 9 See also 10 References 11 External links History[edit] KAPSARC was inaugurated by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Salman in 2016,[3] KAPSARC's activities are funded in perpetuity by an endowment provided by the Government of Saudi Arabia.[4] Governance[edit] KAPSARC's Board of Trustees has controlling authority over the center's affairs, policies and governance. Chaired by the Minister of Energy (HRH Prince Abdilaziz Bin Salman Al-Saud), it comprises the president, three international members and three Saudi members.[5] The center is supported by the International Advisory Council (IAC), a group of globally recognized energy thought leaders who advise the center on its ongoing projects.[6] The IAC meets once a year and consists of several members of national, regional and international stature, such as Majid Al-Moneef, Turki Al-Saud, Jin-Yong Cai, Daniel Yergin, Sunita Narain, Richard Newell, Adnan Shihab-Eldin and others.[7] The endowment of the center enables researchers to conduct independent, objective research without the need to raise capital and without pressure from external donors. Campus[edit] The KAPSARC campus on the northern edge of Riyadh contains both a Residential Campus (called the REC, located on the west side) and a Research and Office Complex (called the ROC, on the east side).[8] The 70,000 square meters[9] Research and Office Complex was designed by Zaha Hadid, and supported by Event Communications.[10][11] Hadid received the commission after a 2009 design competition. It opened in October 2017[12] and received a LEED Platinum certification. The complex consists of five interlocking buildings, a research center, a computer center, a conference center, a library and the Musalla, a place for prayer.[13] Research initiatives and publications[edit] In 2019, KAPSARC created four new energy-economics products during aiming to highlight the hottest topics locally and globally. The new products are seeking to support decision-makers to reach Vision 2030 goals by providing pivotal insights and recommendations to ensure energy security, diversify economic resources, and curb climate change.[14] The center also issued five podcasts, 20 Instant Insights, nine Commentaries, and 12 open models and tools, seeking to discuss new challenges in the areas of economy, water, energy, environment, and technology, with analysis and solutions by the center's researchers. One of its flagship models is called the KAPSARC Energy Model (KEM).[15] In 2019 the center's publications in 10 initiatives – including energy, economy, oil, electricity, transportation, and climate change – rose by 32.5% compared with 2018, from 86 to 114 studies.[16] KAPSARC focused on 10 key initiatives, which include: evaluation of public investment projects; future of transport and fuel demand; future of energy, oil and gas markets; climate change; electricity sector transition;, economic diversification, energy and economic vulnerability and models, data, and tools. The center introduced more than 1250 open access models and research tools to advance the understanding of energy economics and environment policy pathways.[17] Awards[edit] Since KAPSARC's inauguration, the center received five awards highlighting the architecture and engineering of the center: LEED Platinum Certified Global Best Project of the Year in the category of education and research buildings, presented by ENR Engineering News-Record World Architecture Community Award Described by New York Times® as Environmental Beauty and Efficiency Saudi Arabia's “Smartest Building” in the Honeywell® smart building award.[18] KAPSARC and G20[edit] KAPSARC has been working alongside the Saudi G20 Secretariat on programs that are associated with the G20 Summit that will be hosted in Riyadh in 2020. The Think 20 (T20) Engagement Group provides research-based policy advice, facilitates interaction and communicates with the broader public on important issues related to the G20 nations that represent 85% of the world's economy and 75% of the global population. KAPSARC represented Saudi Arabia at the T20 summit in Buenos Aires in September 2018 and participated in the T20 inception meeting for 2019 that was held in Tokyo in December 2018.[19] KAPSARC and T20[edit] KAPSARC and the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies (KFCRIS) held the Think20 (T20) Inception Conference in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on January 19–20, 2020[20] The T20 is an engagement group that contributes to the G20 by providing research-based policy recommendations to the G20. The T20 communiqué presents vital policy recommendations developed by T20 Saudi Arabia task forces for consideration by the Leaders of G20 member countries during their summit in Riyadh in November 2020.[21] The Inception Conference convened more than 150 institutions and think tanks, and over 550 attendees from 65 countries,[22] to discuss a range of essential issues covering climate and energy, women and youth, innovation and technology, multilateralism, economic development and finance, food security and access to water. Partners[edit] KAPSARC has the strength of its international ties with more than 24 research institutes, public policy organizations and government institutions worldwide. Its collaborations allow it to further enrich its research output. They include: King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy (KSA) King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KSA) Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research Ministry of Economy and Planning (KSA) Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (KSA) Saudi Aramco (KSA) Saudi Electricity Company (KSA) Saudi Standards, Metrology and Quality Organization (KSA) TERI University (India) The Energy and Resources Institute (India) World Bank Arabian Gulf University (Bahrain) Atlantic Council (United States) Center for Strategic and International Studies (United States) China National Petroleum Corporation – Institute of Economics and Technology China Sustainable Transport Center Derasat (Bahrain) Electricity and Cogeneration Regulatory Authority (KSA) Energy Research Institute of the NDRC (China) Gulf Cooperation Council Interconnection Authority (KSA) Imperial College (United Kingdom) Khalifa University of Science and Technology (UAE) The center has also signed an MOU with SEC,[23] GCCIA[24] and ECRA[25] to develop the future of electricity in the kingdom and optimize electricity trade between GCC and MENA countries.

The project successfully identified key opportunities and challenges in improving existing energy balances compiled by reputable international organizations. Read more Energy Balance App Crude Oil Storage Cost CrudeStore App This model represents a spread option-based formulation that adds a locational dimension to the conventional storage theory and is based on the prices of crude oil at two different locations, factoring in costs of storage and transportation, and the time required to transport oil between them. This methodology offers a viable alternative to the traditional cost of carry approach; it can also estimate implied convenience yields and the shadow price of inventories, aiding commodity trading strategies. The three key drivers of inventories—the cost of carry, convenience yield and spread option value—are estimated for eight primary international crude oil storage hubs located at major seaports using daily data from December 21, 2015 to January 25, 2019.

London has been a major settlement for two millennia.[10] The City of London, London's ancient core and financial centre, was founded by the Romans and originally called Londinium; with an area of just 1.12 square miles (2.9 km2) and colloquially known as the Square Mile, it retains boundaries that closely follow its medieval limits.[note 1][11][12][13][14][15] The adjacent City of Westminster has for centuries been the location of much of the national government. Thirty-one additional boroughs north and south of the river also comprise modern London. The London region is governed by the mayor of London and the London Assembly.[note 2][16][17] London is one of the world's most important global cities.[18] It exerts considerable influence on the arts, commerce, education, entertainment, fashion, finance, healthcare, media, professional services, research and development, tourism, and transportation.[19] It is one of the largest financial centres in the world and in 2019, London had the second highest number of ultra high-net-worth individuals in Europe, after Paris.[20] And in 2020, London had the second-highest number of billionaires of any city in Europe, after Moscow.[21] London's universities form the largest concentration of higher education institutes in Europe,[22] and London is home to highly ranked institutions such as Imperial College London in natural and applied sciences, the London School of Economics in social sciences, as well as the comprehensive University College London.[23] In 2012, London became the first city to have hosted three modern Summer Olympic Games.[24] London has a diverse range of people and cultures, and more than 300 languages are spoken in the region.[25] Its estimated mid-2018 municipal population (corresponding to Greater London) was roughly 9 million,[5] which made it the third-most populous city in Europe.[26] London accounts for 13.4% of the U.K. population.[27] Greater London Built-up Area is the fourth-most populous in Europe, after Istanbul, Moscow, and Paris, with 9,787,426 inhabitants at the 2011 census.[28][29] The London metropolitan area is the third-most populous in Europe, after Istanbul and the Moscow Metropolitan Area, with 14,040,163 inhabitants in 2016.[note 3][4][30] London contains four World Heritage Sites: the Tower of London; Kew Gardens; the site comprising the Palace of Westminster, Westminster Abbey, and St Margaret's Church; and the historic settlement in Greenwich where the Royal Observatory, Greenwich defines the Prime Meridian (0° longitude) and Greenwich Mean Time.[31] Other landmarks include Buckingham Palace, the London Eye, Piccadilly Circus, St Paul's Cathedral, Tower Bridge, Trafalgar Square and The Shard. London has numerous museums, galleries, libraries and sporting events. These include the British Museum, National Gallery, Natural History Museum, Tate Modern, British Library and West End theatres.[32] The London Underground is the oldest rapid transit system in the world.Contents 1 Toponymy 2 History 2.1 Prehistory 2.2 Roman London 2.3 Anglo-Saxon and Viking period London 2.4 Middle Ages 2.5 Early modern 2.6 Late modern and contemporary 3 Administration 3.1 Local government 3.2 National government 3.3 Policing and crime 4 Geography 4.1 Scope 4.2 Status 4.3 Topography 4.4 Climate 4.5 Districts 4.6 Architecture 4.7 Cityscape 4.8 Natural history 5 Demography 5.1 Age structure and median age (2018) 5.2 Ethnic groups 5.3 Religion 5.4 Accents 6 Economy 6.1 The City of London 6.2 Media and technology 6.3 Tourism 7 Transport 7.1 Aviation 7.2 Rail 7.2.1 Underground and DLR 7.2.2 Suburban 7.2.3 Inter-city and international 7.2.4 Freight 7.3 Buses, coaches and trams 7.4 Cable car 7.5 Cycling 7.6 Port and river boats 7.7 Roads 8 Education 8.1 Tertiary education 8.2 Primary and secondary education 9 Culture 9.1 Leisure and entertainment 9.2 Literature, film and television 9.3 Museums, art galleries and libraries 9.4 Music 10 Recreation 10.1 Parks and open spaces 10.2 Walking 11 Sport 12 Notable people 13 See also 14 Notes 15 References 15.1 Bibliography 16 External links Toponymy Main article: Etymology of London London is an ancient name, already attested in the first century AD, usually in the Latinised form Londinium;[33] for example, handwritten Roman tablets recovered in the city originating from AD 65/70–80 include the word Londinio ('in London').[34] Over the years, the name has attracted many mythicising explanations. The earliest attested appears in Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae, written around 1136.[33][35] Modern scientific analyses of the name must account for the origins of the different forms found in early sources: Latin (usually Londinium), Old English (usually Lunden), and Welsh (usually Llundein), with reference to the known developments over time of sounds in those different languages. It is agreed that the name came into these languages from Common Brythonic; recent work tends to reconstruct the lost Celtic form of the name as *Londonjon or something similar. This was adapted into Latin as Londinium and borrowed into Old English, the ancestor-language of English.[36] The toponymy of the Common Brythonic form is much debated. A prominent explanation was Richard Coates's 1998 argument that the name derived from pre-Celtic Old European *(p)lowonida, meaning ""river too wide to ford"". Coates suggested that this was a name given to the part of the River Thames which flows through London; from this, the settlement gained the Celtic form of its name, *Lowonidonjon.[37] However, most work has accepted a Celtic origin for the name, and recent studies have favoured an explanation along the lines of a Celtic derivative of a Proto-Indo-European root *lendh- ('sink, cause to sink'), combined with the Celtic suffix *-injo- or *-onjo- (used to form place-names). Peter Schrijver has specifically suggested, on these grounds, that the name originally meant 'place that floods (periodically, tidally)'.[38][36] Until 1889, the name ""London"" applied officially only to the City of London, but since then it has also referred to the County of London and to Greater London.[39] In writing, ""London"" is, on occasion, colloquially contracted to ""LDN"".[40][clarification needed] Such usage originated in SMS language, and is often found, on a social media user profile, suffixing an alias or handle. History Main articles: History of London and Timeline of London Prehistory In 1993, the remains of a Bronze Age bridge were found on the south foreshore, upstream of Vauxhall Bridge.[41] This bridge either crossed the Thames or reached a now lost island in it. Two of those timbers were radiocarbon dated to between 1750 BC and 1285 BC.[41] In 2010, the foundations of a large timber structure, dated to between 4800 BC and 4500 BC,[42] were found on the Thames's south foreshore, downstream of Vauxhall Bridge.[43] The function of the mesolithic structure is not known. Both structures are on the south bank of the Thames where the now-underground River Effra flows into the Thames.[43] Roman London Main article: Londinium In 1300, the City was still confined within the Roman walls. Although there is evidence of scattered Brythonic settlements in the area, the first major settlement was founded by the Romans about four years[2] after the invasion of AD 43.[44] This lasted only until around AD 61, when the Iceni tribe led by Queen Boudica stormed it, burning the settlement to the ground.[45] The next, heavily planned, incarnation of Londinium prospered, and it superseded Colchester as the capital of the Roman province of Britannia in 100. At its height in the 2nd century, Roman London had a population of around 60,000.[46] Anglo-Saxon and Viking period London With the collapse of Roman rule in the early 5th century, London ceased to be a capital, and the walled city of Londinium was effectively abandoned, although Roman civilisation continued in the area of St Martin-in-the-Fields until around 450.[47] From around 500, an Anglo-Saxon settlement known as Lundenwic developed slightly west of the old Roman city.[48] By about 680, the city had regrown into a major port, although there is little evidence of large-scale production. From the 820s repeated Viking assaults brought decline. Three are recorded; those in 851 and 886 succeeded, while the last, in 994, was rebuffed.[49] The Lancastrian siege of London in 1471 is attacked by a Yorkist sally. The Vikings established Danelaw over much of eastern and northern England; its boundary stretched roughly from London to Chester. It was an area of political and geographical control imposed by the Viking incursions which was formally agreed by the Danish warlord, Guthrum and the West Saxon king Alfred the Great in 886. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle recorded that Alfred ""refounded"" London in 886. Archaeological research shows that this involved abandonment of Lundenwic and a revival of life and trade within the old Roman walls. London then grew slowly until about 950, after which activity increased dramatically.[50] By the 11th century, London was beyond all comparison the largest town in England. Westminster Abbey, rebuilt in the Romanesque style by King Edward the Confessor, was one of the grandest churches in Europe. Winchester had previously been the capital of Anglo-Saxon England, but from this time on, London became the main forum for foreign traders and the base for defence in time of war. In the view of Frank Stenton: ""It had the resources, and it was rapidly developing the dignity and the political self-consciousness appropriate to a national capital.""[51][52] Middle Ages Westminster Abbey, as seen in this painting (by Canaletto, 1749), is a World Heritage Site and one of London's oldest and most important buildings. After winning the Battle of Hastings, William, Duke of Normandy was crowned King of England in the newly completed Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day 1066.[53] William constructed the Tower of London, the first of the many Norman castles in England to be rebuilt in stone, in the southeastern corner of the city, to intimidate the native inhabitants.[54] In 1097, William II began the building of Westminster Hall, close by the abbey of the same name. The hall became the basis of a new Palace of Westminster.[55][56] In the 12th century, the institutions of central government, which had hitherto accompanied the royal English court as it moved around the country, grew in size and sophistication and became increasingly fixed in one place. For most purposes this was Westminster, although the royal treasury, having been moved from Winchester, came to rest in the Tower. While the City of Westminster developed into a true capital in governmental terms, its distinct neighbour, the City of London, remained England's largest city and principal commercial centre, and it flourished under its own unique administration, the Corporation of London. In 1100, its population was around 18,000; by 1300 it had grown to nearly 100,000.[57] Disaster struck in the form of the Black Death in the mid-14th century, when London lost nearly a third of its population.[58] London was the focus of the Peasants' Revolt in 1381.[59] London was also a centre of England's Jewish population before their expulsion by Edward I in 1290. Violence against Jews took place in 1190, after it was rumoured that the new king had ordered their massacre after they had presented themselves at his coronation.[60] In 1264 during the Second Barons' War, Simon de Montfort's rebels killed 500 Jews while attempting to seize records of debts.[61] Early modern Map of London in 1593. There is only one bridge across the Thames, but parts of Southwark on the south bank of the river have been developed. During the Tudor period the Reformation produced a gradual shift to Protestantism, and much of London property passed from church to private ownership, which accelerated trade and business in the city.[62] In 1475, the Hanseatic League set up its main trading base (kontor) of England in London, called the Stalhof or Steelyard. It existed until 1853, when the Hanseatic cities of Lübeck, Bremen and Hamburg sold the property to South Eastern Railway.[63] Woollen cloth was shipped undyed and undressed from 14th/15th century London to the nearby shores of the Low Countries, where it was considered indispensable.[64] But the reach of English maritime enterprise hardly extended beyond the seas of north-west Europe. The commercial route to Italy and the Mediterranean Sea normally lay through Antwerp and over the Alps; any ships passing through the Strait of Gibraltar to or from England were likely to be Italian or Ragusan. Upon the re-opening of the Netherlands to English shipping in January 1565, there ensued a strong outburst of commercial activity.[65] The Royal Exchange was founded.[66] Mercantilism grew, and monopoly trading companies such as the East India Company were established, with trade expanding to the New World. London became the principal North Sea port, with migrants arriving from England and abroad. The population rose from an estimated 50,000 in 1530 to about 225,000 in 1605.[62] In the 16th century William Shakespeare and his contemporaries lived in London at a time of hostility to the development of the theatre. By the end of the Tudor period in 1603, London was still very compact. There was an assassination attempt on James I in Westminster, in the Gunpowder Plot on 5 November 1605.[67] In 1637, the government of Charles I attempted to reform administration in the area of London. The plan called for the Corporation of the city to extend its jurisdiction and administration over expanding areas around the city. Fearing an attempt by the Crown to diminish the Liberties of London, a lack of interest in administering these additional areas, or concern by city guilds of having to share power, the Corporation refused. Later called ""The Great Refusal"", this decision largely continues to account for the unique governmental status of the City.[68] Vertue's 1738 plan of the Lines of Communication, built during the English Civil War In the English Civil War the majority of Londoners supported the Parliamentary cause. After an initial advance by the Royalists in 1642, culminating in the battles of Brentford and Turnham Green, London was surrounded by a defensive perimeter wall known as the Lines of Communication. The lines were built by up to 20,000 people, and were completed in under two months.[69] The fortifications failed their only test when the New Model Army entered London in 1647,[70] and they were levelled by Parliament the same year.[71] London was plagued by disease in the early 17th century,[72] culminating in the Great Plague of 1665–1666, which killed up to 100,000 people, or a fifth of the population.[73] The Great Fire of London destroyed many parts of the city in 1666. The Great Fire of London broke out in 1666 in Pudding Lane in the city and quickly swept through the wooden buildings.[74] Rebuilding took over ten years and was supervised by Robert Hooke[75][76][77] as Surveyor of London.[78] In 1708 Christopher Wren's masterpiece, St Paul's Cathedral was completed. During the Georgian era, new districts such as Mayfair were formed in the west; new bridges over the Thames encouraged development in South London. In the east, the Port of London expanded downstream. London's development as an international financial centre matured for much of the 1700s. In 1762, George III acquired Buckingham House and it was enlarged over the next 75 years. During the 18th century, London was dogged by crime, and the Bow Street Runners were established in 1750 as a professional police force.[79] In total, more than 200 offences were punishable by death,[80] including petty theft.[81] Most children born in the city died before reaching their third birthday.[82] View to the Royal Exchange in the City of London in 1886 The coffeehouse became a popular place to debate ideas, with growing literacy and the development of the printing press making news widely available; and Fleet Street became the centre of the British press. Following the invasion of Amsterdam by Napoleonic armies, many financiers relocated to London and the first London international issue was arranged in 1817. Around the same time, the Royal Navy became the world leading war fleet, acting as a serious deterrent to potential economic adversaries of the United Kingdom. The repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 was specifically aimed at weakening Dutch economic power. London then overtook Amsterdam as the leading international financial centre.[83][84] According to Samuel Johnson: You find no man, at all intellectual, who is willing to leave London. No, Sir, when a man is tired of London, he is tired of life; for there is in London all that life can afford.— Samuel Johnson, 1777[85] Late modern and contemporary London was the world's largest city from c.1831 to 1925,[86] with a population density of 325 people per hectare.[87] London's overcrowded conditions led to cholera epidemics,[88] claiming 14,000 lives in 1848, and 6,000 in 1866.[89] Rising traffic congestion led to the creation of the world's first local urban rail network. The Metropolitan Board of Works oversaw infrastructure expansion in the capital and some of the surrounding counties; it was abolished in 1889 when the London County Council was created out of those areas of the counties surrounding the capital. British volunteer recruits in London, August 1914, during World War IA bombed-out London street during the Blitz, World War II London was bombed by the Germans during the First World War,[90] and during the Second World War, the Blitz and other bombings by the German Luftwaffe killed over 30,000 Londoners, destroying large tracts of housing and other buildings across the city.[91] The 1948 Summer Olympics were held at the original Wembley Stadium, at a time when London was still recovering from the war.[92] From the 1940s onwards, London became home to many immigrants, primarily from Commonwealth countries such as Jamaica, India, Bangladesh and Pakistan,[93] making London one of the most diverse cities worldwide. In 1951, the Festival of Britain was held on the South Bank.[94] The Great Smog of 1952 led to the Clean Air Act 1956, which ended the ""pea soup fogs"" for which London had been notorious.[95] Primarily starting in the mid-1960s, London became a centre for the worldwide youth culture, exemplified by the Swinging London subculture[96] associated with the King's Road, Chelsea[97] and Carnaby Street.[98] The role of trendsetter was revived during the punk era.[99] In 1965 London's political boundaries were expanded to take into account the growth of the urban area and a new Greater London Council was created.[100] During The Troubles in Northern Ireland, London was subjected to bombing attacks by the Provisional Irish Republican Army[101] for two decades, starting with the Old Bailey bombing in 1973.[102][103] Racial inequality was highlighted by the 1981 Brixton riot.[104] Greater London's population declined steadily in the decades after the Second World War, from an estimated peak of 8.6 million in 1939 to around 6.8 million in the 1980s.[105] The principal ports for London moved downstream to Felixstowe and Tilbury, with the London Docklands area becoming a focus for regeneration, including the Canary Wharf development. This was borne out of London's ever-increasing role as a major international financial centre during the 1980s.[106] The Thames Barrier was completed in the 1980s to protect London against tidal surges from the North Sea.[107] The Greater London Council was abolished in 1986, which left London without a central administration until 2000 when London-wide government was restored, with the creation of the Greater London Authority.[108] To celebrate the start of the 21st century, the Millennium Dome, London Eye and Millennium Bridge were constructed.[109] On 6 July 2005 London was awarded the 2012 Summer Olympics, making London the first city to stage the Olympic Games three times.[110] On 7 July 2005, three London Underground trains and a double-decker bus were bombed in a series of terrorist attacks.[111] In 2008, Time named London alongside New York City and Hong Kong as Nylonkong, hailing it as the world's three most influential global cities.[112] In January 2015, Greater London's population was estimated to be 8.63 million, the highest level since 1939.[113] During the Brexit referendum in 2016, the UK as a whole decided to leave the European Union, but a majority of London constituencies voted to remain in the EU.[114] Administration Politics of London Greater London Authority Mayor of London Sadiq Khan Mayoral elections Statutory Deputy Mayor Joanne McCartney Mayoral cabinet London Assembly Constituencies 2016 London Assembly election GLA Group Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime Transport for London London Fire Commissioner London Legacy Development Corporation & Old Oak and Park Royal Development Corporation London Plan 1998 referendum 1999 Act 2007 Act London Councils City of London Corporation Lord Mayor Peter Estlin Court of Aldermen Court of Common Council 2017 City of London Corporation election Freemen Livery Sheriffs Wards London boroughs 2018 London local elections Wards London in the UK Minister for London Paul Scully Parliamentary constituencies in London London Government Act 1963 London portal Politics portalvte Local government Main articles: Local government in London, History of local government in London, and List of heads of London government The administration of London is formed of two tiers: a citywide, strategic tier and a local tier. Citywide administration is coordinated by the Greater London Authority (GLA), while local administration is carried out by 33 smaller authorities.[115] The GLA consists of two elected components: the mayor of London, who has executive powers, and the London Assembly, which scrutinises the mayor's decisions and can accept or reject the mayor's budget proposals each year. The headquarters of the GLA is City Hall, Southwark. The mayor since 2016 has been Sadiq Khan, the first Muslim mayor of a major Western capital.[116][117] The mayor's statutory planning strategy is published as the London Plan, which was most recently revised in 2011.[118] The local authorities are the councils of the 32 London boroughs and the City of London Corporation.[119] They are responsible for most local services, such as local planning, schools, social services, local roads and refuse collection. Certain functions, such as waste management, are provided through joint arrangements. In 2009–2010 the combined revenue expenditure by London councils and the GLA amounted to just over £22 billion (£14.7 billion for the boroughs and £7.4 billion for the GLA).[120] The London Fire Brigade is the statutory fire and rescue service for Greater London. It is run by the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority and is the third largest fire service in the world.[121] National Health Service ambulance services are provided by the London Ambulance Service (LAS) NHS Trust, the largest free-at-the-point-of-use emergency ambulance service in the world.[122] The London Air Ambulance charity operates in conjunction with the LAS where required. Her Majesty's Coastguard and the Royal National Lifeboat Institution operate on the River Thames,[123][124] which is under the jurisdiction of the Port of London Authority from Teddington Lock to the sea.[125] National government London is the seat of the Government of the United Kingdom. Many government departments, as well as the prime minister's residence at 10 Downing Street, are based close to the Palace of Westminster, particularly along Whitehall.[126] There are 73 members of Parliament (MPs) from London, elected from local parliamentary constituencies in the national Parliament. As of December 2019[update], 49 are from the Labour Party, 21 are Conservatives, and three are Liberal Democrat.[127] The ministerial post of minister for London was created in 1994. The current Minister for London is Paul Scully MP.[128] Policing and crime Main article: Crime in London Policing in Greater London, with the exception of the City of London, is provided by the Metropolitan Police, overseen by the mayor through the Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime (MOPAC).[129][130] The City of London has its own police force – the City of London Police.[131] The British Transport Police are responsible for police services on National Rail, London Underground, Docklands Light Railway and Tramlink services.[132] The Ministry of Defence Police is a special police force in London, which does not generally become involved with policing the general public.[133] Crime rates vary widely across different areas of London. Crime figures are made available nationally at Local Authority and Ward level.[134] In 2015, there were 118 homicides, a 25.5% increase over 2014.[135] The Metropolitan Police have made detailed crime figures, broken down by category at borough and ward level, available on their website since 2000.[136][137] Recorded crime has been rising in London, notably violent crime and murder by stabbing and other means have risen. There were 50 murders from the start of 2018 to mid April 2018. Funding cuts to police in London are likely to have contributed to this, though other factors are also involved.[138] Geography Main article: Geography of London Scope Satellite view of London in June 2018 London, also referred to as Greater London, is one of nine regions of England and the top-level subdivision covering most of the city's metropolis.[note 4] The small ancient City of London at its core once comprised the whole settlement, but as its urban area grew, the Corporation of London resisted attempts to amalgamate the city with its suburbs , causing ""London"" to be defined in a number of ways for different purposes.[139] Forty per cent of Greater London is covered by the London post town, within which 'LONDON' forms part of postal addresses.[140][141] The London telephone area code (020) covers a larger area, similar in size to Greater London, although some outer districts are excluded and some places just outside are included. The Greater London boundary has been aligned to the M25 motorway in places.[142] Outward urban expansion is now prevented by the Metropolitan Green Belt,[143] although the built-up area extends beyond the boundary in places, resulting in a separately defined Greater London Urban Area. Beyond this is the vast London commuter belt.[144] Greater London is split for some purposes into Inner London and Outer London.[145] The city is split by the River Thames into North and South, with an informal central London area in its interior. The coordinates of the nominal centre of London, traditionally considered to be the original Eleanor Cross at Charing Cross near the junction of Trafalgar Square and Whitehall, are about 51°30′26″N 00°07′39″W﻿ / ﻿51.50722°N 0.12750°W﻿ / 51.50722; -0.12750.[146] However the geographical centre of London, on one definition, is in the London Borough of Lambeth, just 0.1 miles to the northeast of Lambeth North tube station.[147] Status Within London, both the City of London and the City of Westminster have city status and both the City of London and the remainder of Greater London are counties for the purposes of lieutenancies.[148] The area of Greater London includes areas that are part of the historic counties of Middlesex, Kent, Surrey, Essex and Hertfordshire.[149] London's status as the capital of England, and later the United Kingdom, has never been granted or confirmed officially—by statute or in written form.[note 5] Its position was formed through constitutional convention, making its status as de facto capital a part of the UK's uncodified constitution. The capital of England was moved to London from Winchester as the Palace of Westminster developed in the 12th and 13th centuries to become the permanent location of the royal court, and thus the political capital of the nation.[153] More recently, Greater London has been defined as a region of England and in this context is known as London.[14] Topography London from Primrose Hill Greater London encompasses a total area of 1,583 square kilometres (611 sq mi), an area which had a population of 7,172,036 in 2001 and a population density of 4,542 inhabitants per square kilometre (11,760/sq mi). The extended area known as the London Metropolitan Region or the London Metropolitan Agglomeration, comprises a total area of 8,382 square kilometres (3,236 sq mi) has a population of 13,709,000 and a population density of 1,510 inhabitants per square kilometre (3,900/sq mi).[154] Modern London stands on the Thames, its primary geographical feature, a navigable river which crosses the city from the south-west to the east. The Thames Valley is a floodplain surrounded by gently rolling hills including Parliament Hill, Addington Hills, and Primrose Hill. Historically London grew up at the lowest bridging point on the Thames. The Thames was once a much broader, shallower river with extensive marshlands; at high tide, its shores reached five times their present width.[155] Since the Victorian era the Thames has been extensively embanked, and many of its London tributaries now flow underground. The Thames is a tidal river, and London is vulnerable to flooding.[156] The threat has increased over time because of a slow but continuous rise in high water level by the slow 'tilting' of the British Isles (up in Scotland and Northern Ireland and down in southern parts of England, Wales and Ireland) caused by post-glacial rebound.[157][158] In 1974 a decade of work began on the construction of the Thames Barrier across the Thames at Woolwich to deal with this threat. While the barrier is expected to function as designed until roughly 2070, concepts for its future enlargement or redesign are already being discussed.[159] Climate Main article: Climate of London London, United Kingdom Climate chart (explanation) J F M A M J J A S O N D 55 8 2 41 8 2 42 11 4 44 14 6 49 18 9 45 22 12 45 24 14 50 23 14 49 20 11 69 16 8 59 11 5 55 8 3 Average max. and min. temperatures in °C Precipitation totals in mm Imperial conversion JFMAMJJASOND 2.2 47 36 1.6 47 36 1.6 52 39 1.7 58 42 1.9 64 48 1.8 72 53 1.8 74 57 1.9 74 57 1.9 68 53 2.7 60 47 2.3 52 41 2.2 47 37 Average max. and min. temperatures in °F Precipitation totals in inches London has a temperate oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb ). Rainfall records have been kept in the city since at least 1697, when records began at Kew. At Kew, the most rainfall in one month is 7.4 inches (189 mm) in November 1755 and the least is 0 inches (0 mm) in both December 1788 and July 1800. Mile End also had 0 inches (0 mm) in April 1893.[160] The wettest year on record is 1903, with a total fall of 38.1 inches (969 mm) and the driest is 1921, with a total fall of 12.1 inches (308 mm).[161] The average annual precipitation amounts to about 600 mm, lower than cities such as Rome, Lisbon, New York City and Sydney.[162][163][164] Nevertheless, despite its relatively low annual precipitation, London still receives 109.6 rainy days on the 1.0 mm threshold annually—higher than, or at least very similar to, the aforementioned cities. Temperature extremes in London range from 38.1 °C (100.6 °F) at Kew on 10 August 2003[165] down to −16.1 °C (3.0 °F) at Northolt on 1 January 1962.[166][167] Records for atmospheric pressure have been kept at London since 1692. The highest pressure ever reported is 1,049.8 millibars (31.00 inHg) on 20 January 2020.[168] Summers are generally warm, sometimes hot. London's average July high is 23.5 °C (74.3 °F). On average each year, London experiences 31 days above 25 °C (77.0 °F) and 4.2 days above 30.0 °C (86.0 °F). During the 2003 European heat wave prolonged heat led to hundreds of heat-related deaths.[169] There was also a previous spell of 15 consecutive days above 32.2 °C (90.0 °F) in England in 1976 which also caused many heat related deaths.[170] A previous temperature of 37.8 °C (100.0 °F) in August 1911 at the Greenwich station, though this was later disregarded as non-standard.[171] Droughts can also, occasionally, be a problem, especially in summer. Most recently in Summer 2018[172] and with much drier than average conditions prevailing from May to December.[173] However, the most consecutive days without rain was 73 days in the spring of 1893.[174] Winters are generally cool with little temperature variation. Heavy snow is rare but snow usually falls at least once each winter. Spring and autumn can be pleasant. As a large city, London has a considerable urban heat island effect,[175] making the centre of London at times 5 °C (9 °F) warmer than the suburbs and outskirts. This can be seen below when comparing London Heathrow, 15 miles (24 km) west of London, with the London Weather Centre.[176] vteClimate data for London (LHR),[a] elevation: 25 m (82 ft), 1981–2010 normals Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °C (°F) 17.2(63.0) 21.2(70.2) 24.5(76.1) 29.4(84.9) 32.8(91.0) 35.6(96.1) 37.9(100.2) 38.1(100.6) 35.0(95.0) 29.5(85.1) 21.1(70.0) 17.4(63.3) 38.1(100.6) Average high °C (°F) 8.1(46.6) 8.4(47.1) 11.3(52.3) 14.2(57.6) 17.9(64.2) 21.2(70.2) 23.5(74.3) 23.2(73.8) 20.0(68.0) 15.5(59.9) 11.1(52.0) 8.3(46.9) 15.2(59.4) Daily mean °C (°F) 5.2(41.4) 5.3(41.5) 7.6(45.7) 9.9(49.8) 13.3(55.9) 16.5(61.7) 18.7(65.7) 18.5(65.3) 15.7(60.3) 12.0(53.6) 8.0(46.4) 5.5(41.9) 11.3(52.3) Average low °C (°F) 2.3(36.1) 2.1(35.8) 3.9(39.0) 5.5(41.9) 8.7(47.7) 11.7(53.1) 13.9(57.0) 13.7(56.7) 11.4(52.5) 8.4(47.1) 4.9(40.8) 2.7(36.9) 7.4(45.4) Record low °C (°F) −16.1(3.0) −12.2(10.0) −8.3(17.1) −3.2(26.2) −3.1(26.4) −0.6(30.9) 3.9(39.0) 2.1(35.8) 1.4(34.5) −5.5(22.1) −7.1(19.2) −14.2(6.4) −16.1(3.0) Average precipitation mm (inches) 55.2(2.17) 40.9(1.61) 41.6(1.64) 43.7(1.72) 49.4(1.94) 45.1(1.78) 44.5(1.75) 49.5(1.95) 49.1(1.93) 68.5(2.70) 59.0(2.32) 55.2(2.17) 601.7(23.68) Average precipitation days (≥ 1.0 mm) 11.1 8.5 9.3 9.1 8.8 8.2 7.7 7.5 8.1 10.8 10.3 10.2 109.6 Mean monthly sunshine hours 61.5 77.9 114.6 168.7 198.5 204.3 212.0 204.7 149.3 116.5 72.6 52.0 1,632.6 Percent possible sunshine 23 28 31 40 41 41 42 45 40 35 27 21 35 Average ultraviolet index 1 1 2 4 5 6 6 5 4 2 1 0 3 Source 1: Met Office[177][178][179] Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute[180][181] For more station data, see Climate of London.

Districts Main articles: List of districts of London and London boroughs Places within London's vast urban area are identified using district names, such as Mayfair, Southwark, Wembley and Whitechapel. These are either informal designations, reflect the names of villages that have been absorbed by sprawl, or are superseded administrative units such as parishes or former boroughs. Such names have remained in use through tradition, each referring to a local area with its own distinctive character, but without official boundaries. Since 1965 Greater London has been divided into 32 London boroughs in addition to the ancient City of London.[185][186] The City of London is the main financial district,[187] and Canary Wharf has recently developed into a new financial and commercial hub in the Docklands to the east. The West End is London's main entertainment and shopping district, attracting tourists.[188] West London includes expensive residential areas where properties can sell for tens of millions of pounds.[189] The average price for properties in Kensington and Chelsea is over £2 million with a similarly high outlay in most of central London.[190][191] The East End is the area closest to the original Port of London, known for its high immigrant population, as well as for being one of the poorest areas in London.[192] The surrounding East London area saw much of London's early industrial development; now, brownfield sites throughout the area are being redeveloped as part of the Thames Gateway including the London Riverside and Lower Lea Valley, which was developed into the Olympic Park for the 2012 Olympics and Paralympics.[192] Architecture Main articles: Architecture of London, List of tallest buildings and structures in London, and List of demolished buildings and structures in London The Tower of London, a medieval castle, dating in part to 1078 Trafalgar Square and its fountains, with Nelson's Column on the right London's buildings are too diverse to be characterised by any particular architectural style, partly because of their varying ages. Many grand houses and public buildings, such as the National Gallery, are constructed from Portland stone. Some areas of the city, particularly those just west of the centre, are characterised by white stucco or whitewashed buildings. Few structures in central London pre-date the Great Fire of 1666, these being a few trace Roman remains, the Tower of London and a few scattered Tudor survivors in the city. Further out is, for example, the Tudor-period Hampton Court Palace, England's oldest surviving Tudor palace, built by Cardinal Thomas Wolsey c.1515.[193] Part of the varied architectural heritage are the 17th-century churches by Wren, neoclassical financial institutions such as the Royal Exchange and the Bank of England, to the early 20th century Old Bailey and the 1960s Barbican Estate. The disused—but soon[when?] to be rejuvenated—1939 Battersea Power Station by the river in the south-west is a local landmark, while some railway termini are excellent examples of Victorian architecture, most notably St. Pancras and Paddington.[194] The density of London varies, with high employment density in the central area and Canary Wharf, high residential densities in inner London, and lower densities in Outer London. Modern styles juxtaposed with historic styles; 30 St Mary Axe, also known as ""The Gherkin"", towers over St Andrew Undershaft. The Monument in the City of London provides views of the surrounding area while commemorating the Great Fire of London, which originated nearby. Marble Arch and Wellington Arch, at the north and south ends of Park Lane, respectively, have royal connections, as do the Albert Memorial and Royal Albert Hall in Kensington. Nelson's Column is a nationally recognised monument in Trafalgar Square, one of the focal points of central London. Older buildings are mainly brick built, most commonly the yellow London stock brick or a warm orange-red variety, often decorated with carvings and white plaster mouldings.[195] In the dense areas, most of the concentration is via medium- and high-rise buildings. London's skyscrapers, such as 30 St Mary Axe, Tower 42, the Broadgate Tower and One Canada Square, are mostly in the two financial districts, the City of London and Canary Wharf. High-rise development is restricted at certain sites if it would obstruct protected views of St Paul's Cathedral and other historic buildings. Nevertheless, there are a number of tall skyscrapers in central London (see Tall buildings in London), including the 95-storey Shard London Bridge, the tallest building in the United Kingdom. Other notable modern buildings include City Hall in Southwark with its distinctive oval shape,[196] the Art Deco BBC Broadcasting House plus the Postmodernist British Library in Somers Town/Kings Cross and No 1 Poultry by James Stirling. What was formerly the Millennium Dome, by the Thames to the east of Canary Wharf, is now an entertainment venue called the O2 Arena. Cityscape The Houses of Parliament and Elizabeth Tower (Big Ben) on the right foreground, the London Eye on the left foreground and The Shard with Canary Wharf in the background; seen in September 2014 Natural history The London Natural History Society suggests that London is ""one of the World's Greenest Cities"" with more than 40 per cent green space or open water. They indicate that 2000 species of flowering plant have been found growing there and that the tidal Thames supports 120 species of fish.[197] They also state that over 60 species of bird nest in central London and that their members have recorded 47 species of butterfly, 1173 moths and more than 270 kinds of spider around London. London's wetland areas support nationally important populations of many water birds. London has 38 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs), two national nature reserves and 76 local nature reserves.[198] Amphibians are common in the capital, including smooth newts living by the Tate Modern, and common frogs, common toads, palmate newts and great crested newts. On the other hand, native reptiles such as slowworms, common lizards, barred grass snakes and adders, are mostly only seen in Outer London.[199] A fox on Ayres Street, Southwark, South London Among other inhabitants of London are 10,000 red foxes, so that there are now 16 foxes for every square mile (2.6 square kilometres) of London. These urban foxes are noticeably bolder than their country cousins, sharing the pavement with pedestrians and raising cubs in people's backyards. Foxes have even sneaked into the Houses of Parliament, where one was found asleep on a filing cabinet. Another broke into the grounds of Buckingham Palace, reportedly killing some of Queen Elizabeth II's prized pink flamingos.[200] Generally, however, foxes and city folk appear to get along. A survey in 2001 by the London-based Mammal Society found that 80 per cent of 3,779 respondents who volunteered to keep a diary of garden mammal visits liked having them around. This sample cannot be taken to represent Londoners as a whole.[201][202] Other mammals found in Greater London are hedgehog, brown rat, mice, rabbit, shrew, vole, and grey squirrel.[203] In wilder areas of Outer London, such as Epping Forest, a wide variety of mammals are found, including European hare, badger, field, bank and water vole, wood mouse, yellow-necked mouse, mole, shrew, and weasel, in addition to red fox, grey squirrel and hedgehog. A dead otter was found at The Highway, in Wapping, about a mile from the Tower Bridge, which would suggest that they have begun to move back after being absent a hundred years from the city.[204] Ten of England's eighteen species of bats have been recorded in Epping Forest: soprano, Nathusius' and common pipistrelles, common noctule, serotine, barbastelle, Daubenton's, brown long-eared, Natterer's and Leisler's.[205] Among the strange sights seen in London have been a whale in the Thames,[206] while the BBC Two programme ""Natural World: Unnatural History of London"" shows feral pigeons using the London Underground to get around the city, a seal that takes fish from fishmongers outside Billingsgate Fish Market, and foxes that will ""sit"" if given sausages.[207] Herds of red and fallow deer also roam freely within much of Richmond and Bushy Park. A cull takes place each November and February to ensure numbers can be sustained.[208] Epping Forest is also known for its fallow deer, which can frequently be seen in herds to the north of the Forest. A rare population of melanistic, black fallow deer is also maintained at the Deer Sanctuary near Theydon Bois. Muntjac deer, which escaped from deer parks at the turn of the twentieth century, are also found in the forest. While Londoners are accustomed to wildlife such as birds and foxes sharing the city, more recently urban deer have started becoming a regular feature, and whole herds of fallow deer come into residential areas at night to take advantage of London's green spaces.[209][210] Demography Main article: Demography of London 2011 United Kingdom Census[211] Country of birth Population United Kingdom 5,175,677 India 262,247 Poland 158,300 Ireland 129,807 Nigeria 114,718 Pakistan 112,457 Bangladesh 109,948 Jamaica 87,467 Sri Lanka 84,542 France 66,654 Population density map The 2011 census recorded that 2,998,264 people or 36.7% of London's population are foreign-born making London the city with the second largest immigrant population, behind New York City, in terms of absolute numbers. About 69% of children born in London in 2015 had at least one parent who was born abroad.[212] The table to the right shows the most common countries of birth of London residents. Note that some of the German-born population, in 18th position, are British citizens from birth born to parents serving in the British Armed Forces in Germany.[213] With increasing industrialisation, London's population grew rapidly throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, and it was for some time in the late 19th and early 20th centuries the most populous city in the world. Its population peaked at 8,615,245 in 1939 immediately before the outbreak of the Second World War, but had declined to 7,192,091 at the 2001 Census. However, the population then grew by just over a million between the 2001 and 2011 Censuses, to reach 8,173,941 in the latter enumeration.[214] However, London's continuous urban area extends beyond the borders of Greater London and was home to 9,787,426 people in 2011,[29] while its wider metropolitan area has a population of between 12 and 14 million depending on the definition used.[215][216] According to Eurostat, London is the most populous city and metropolitan area of the European Union and the second most populous in Europe. During the period 1991–2001 a net 726,000 immigrants arrived in London.[217] The region covers an area of 1,579 square kilometres (610 sq mi). The population density is 5,177 inhabitants per square kilometre (13,410/sq mi),[218] more than ten times that of any other British region.[219] In terms of population, London is the 19th largest city and the 18th largest metropolitan region.[220][221] Age structure and median age (2018) Children (aged younger than 14 years) constitute 20.6% of the population in Outer London, and 18% in Inner London; the age group aged between 15 and 24 years is 11.1% in Outer, and 10.2% in Inner London; those aged between 25 and 44 years are 30.6% in Outer London and 39.7% in Inner London; those aged between 45 and 64 years form 24% and 20.7% in Outer and Inner London respectively; while in Outer London those aged 65 and older are 13.6%, though in Inner London just 9.3%.[222] The median age of London in 2018 is 36.5 years old, which is younger than the average in UK of 40.3.[222] Ethnic groups Main article: Ethnic groups in London London maps showing the percentage distribution of selected races according to the 2011 CensusWhite BritishAsian BritishBlack British According to the Office for National Statistics, based on the 2011 Census estimates, 59.8 per cent of the 8,173,941 inhabitants of London were White, with 44.9 per cent White British, 2.2 per cent White Irish, 0.1 per cent gypsy/Irish traveller and 12.1 per cent classified as Other White.[223] 20.9 per cent of Londoners are of Asian and mixed-Asian descent. 19.7 per cent are of full Asian descent, with those of mixed-Asian heritage comprising 1.2 of the population. Indians account for 6.6 per cent of the population, followed by Pakistanis and Bangladeshis at 2.7 per cent each. Chinese peoples account for 1.5 per cent of the population, with Arabs comprising 1.3 per cent. A further 4.9 per cent are classified as ""Other Asian"".[223] 15.6 per cent of London's population are of Black and mixed-Black descent. 13.3 per cent are of full Black descent, with those of mixed-Black heritage comprising 2.3 per cent. Black Africans account for 7.0 per cent of London's population, with 4.2 per cent as Black Caribbean and 2.1 per cent as ""Other Black"". 5.0 per cent are of mixed race.[223] As of 2007, Black and Asian children outnumbered White British children by about six to four in state schools across London.[224] Altogether at the 2011 census, of London's 1,624,768 population aged 0 to 15, 46.4 per cent were White, 19.8 per cent were Asian, 19 per cent were Black, 10.8 per cent were Mixed and 4 per cent represented another ethnic group.[225] In January 2005, a survey of London's ethnic and religious diversity claimed that there were more than 300 languages spoken in London and more than 50 non-indigenous communities with a population of more than 10,000.[226] Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that, in 2010[update], London's foreign-born population was 2,650,000 (33 per cent), up from 1,630,000 in 1997. The 2011 census showed that 36.7 per cent of Greater London's population were born outside the UK.[227] A portion of the German-born population are likely to be British nationals born to parents serving in the British Armed Forces in Germany.[228] Estimates produced by the Office for National Statistics indicate that the five largest foreign-born groups living in London in the period July 2009 to June 2010 were those born in India, Poland, the Republic of Ireland, Bangladesh and Nigeria.[229] Religion Main article: Religion in London Religion in London (2011 census)[230] Religion Percent(%) Christian 48.4% No religion 20.7% Muslim 12.4% Undeclared 8.5% Hindu 5.0% Jewish 1.8% Sikh 1.5% Buddhist 1.0% Other 0.6% According to the 2011 Census, the largest religious groupings are Christians (48.4 per cent), followed by those of no religion (20.7 per cent), Muslims (12.4 per cent), no response (8.5 per cent), Hindus (5.0 per cent), Jews (1.8 per cent), Sikhs (1.5 per cent), Buddhists (1.0 per cent) and other (0.6 per cent). London has traditionally been Christian, and has a large number of churches, particularly in the City of London. The well-known St Paul's Cathedral in the City and Southwark Cathedral south of the river are Anglican administrative centres,[231] while the Archbishop of Canterbury, principal bishop of the Church of England and worldwide Anglican Communion, has his main residence at Lambeth Palace in the London Borough of Lambeth.[232] St Paul's Cathedral, the seat of the Bishop of LondonThe BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir London is the second-largest Hindu temple in England and Europe. Important national and royal ceremonies are shared between St Paul's and Westminster Abbey.[233] The Abbey is not to be confused with nearby Westminster Cathedral, which is the largest Roman Catholic cathedral in England and Wales.[234] Despite the prevalence of Anglican churches, observance is very low within the Anglican denomination. Church attendance continues on a long, slow, steady decline, according to Church of England statistics.[235] London is also home to sizeable Muslim, Hindu, Sikh, and Jewish communities. Notable mosques include the East London Mosque in Tower Hamlets, which is allowed to give the Islamic call to prayer through loudspeakers, the London Central Mosque on the edge of Regent's Park[236] and the Baitul Futuh of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. Following the oil boom, increasing numbers of wealthy Middle-Eastern Arab Muslims have based themselves around Mayfair, Kensington, and Knightsbridge in West London.[237][238][239] There are large Bengali Muslim communities in the eastern boroughs of Tower Hamlets and Newham.[240] Large Hindu communities are in the north-western boroughs of Harrow and Brent, the latter of which hosts what was, until 2006,[241] Europe's largest Hindu temple, Neasden Temple.[242] London is also home to 44 Hindu temples, including the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir London. There are Sikh communities in East and West London, particularly in Southall, home to one of the largest Sikh populations and the largest Sikh temple outside India.[243] The majority of British Jews live in London, with significant Jewish communities in Stamford Hill, Stanmore, Golders Green, Finchley, Hampstead, Hendon and Edgware in North London. Bevis Marks Synagogue in the City of London is affiliated to London's historic Sephardic Jewish community. It is the only synagogue in Europe which has held regular services continuously for over 300 years. Stanmore and Canons Park Synagogue has the largest membership of any single Orthodox synagogue in the whole of Europe, overtaking Ilford synagogue (also in London) in 1998.[244] The community set up the London Jewish Forum in 2006 in response to the growing significance of devolved London Government.[245] Accents Cockney is an accent heard across London, mainly spoken by working-class and lower-middle class Londoners. It is mainly attributed to the East End and wider East London, having originated there in the eighteenth century, although it has been suggested that the Cockney style of speech is much older.[246] John Camden Hotten, in his Slang Dictionary of 1859, makes reference to ""their use of a peculiar slang language"" when describing the costermongers of the East End. Since the turn of the century the Cockney dialect is less common in parts of the East End itself, with modern strongholds including other parts of London and suburbs in the home counties.[247][248] Estuary English is an intermediate accent between Cockney and Received Pronunciation.[249] It is widely spoken by people of all classes in London and south-eastern England, associated with the River Thames and its estuary.[250] Multicultural London English (MLE) is a multiethnolect becoming increasingly common in multicultural areas amongst young, working-class people from diverse backgrounds. It is a fusion of an array of ethnic accents, in particular Afro-Caribbean and South Asian, with a significant Cockney influence.[251] Received Pronunciation (RP) is the accent traditionally regarded as the standard for British English.[252] It has no specific geographical correlate,[253] although it is also traditionally defined as the standard speech used in London and south-eastern England.[254] It is mainly spoken by upper-class and upper-middle class Londoners.[255][256] Economy Main article: Economy of London The City of London, one of the largest financial centres in the world[257] London's gross regional product in 2018 was almost £500 billion, around a quarter of UK GDP.[258] London has five major business districts: the city, Westminster, Canary Wharf, Camden & Islington and Lambeth & Southwark. One way to get an idea of their relative importance is to look at relative amounts of office space: Greater London had 27 million m2 of office space in 2001, and the City contains the most space, with 8 million m2 of office space. London has some of the highest real estate prices in the world.[259][260] London is the world's most expensive office market for the last three years according to world property journal (2015) report.[261] As of 2015[update] the residential property in London is worth $2.2 trillion—the same value as that of Brazil's annual GDP.[262] The city has the highest property prices of any European city according to the Office for National Statistics and the European Office of Statistics.[263] On average the price per square metre in central London is €24,252 (April 2014). This is higher than the property prices in other G8 European capital cities; Berlin €3,306, Rome €6,188 and Paris €11,229.[264] The City of London The London Stock Exchange at Paternoster Square and Temple Bar London's finance industry is based in the City of London and Canary Wharf, the two major business districts in London. London is one of the pre-eminent financial centres of the world as the most important location for international finance.[265][266] London took over as a major financial centre shortly after 1795 when the Dutch Republic collapsed before the Napoleonic armies. For many bankers established in Amsterdam (e.g. Hope, Baring), this was only time to move to London. The London financial elite was strengthened by a strong Jewish community from all over Europe capable of mastering the most sophisticated financial tools of the time.[83] This unique concentration of talents accelerated the transition from the Commercial Revolution to the Industrial Revolution. By the end of the 19th century, Britain was the wealthiest of all nations, and London a leading financial centre. Still, as of 2016[update] London tops the world rankings on the Global Financial Centres Index (GFCI),[267] and it ranked second in A.T. Kearney's 2018 Global Cities Index.[268] A view from Westminster Millennium Pier on the River Thames, December 2018 London's largest industry is finance, and its financial exports make it a large contributor to the UK's balance of payments. Around 325,000 people were employed in financial services in London until mid-2007. London has over 480 overseas banks, more than any other city in the world. It is also the world's biggest currency trading centre, accounting for some 37 per cent of the $5.1 trillion average daily volume, according to the BIS.[269] Over 85 per cent (3.2 million) of the employed population of greater London works in the services industries. Because of its prominent global role, London's economy had been affected by the financial crisis of 2007–2008. However, by 2010 the city had recovered, put in place new regulatory powers, proceeded to regain lost ground and re-established London's economic dominance.[270] Along with professional services headquarters, the City of London is home to the Bank of England, London Stock Exchange, and Lloyd's of London insurance market. Over half of the UK's top 100 listed companies (the FTSE 100) and over 100 of Europe's 500 largest companies have their headquarters in central London. Over 70 per cent of the FTSE 100 are within London's metropolitan area, and 75 per cent of Fortune 500 companies have offices in London.[271] Media and technology Media companies are concentrated in London and the media distribution industry is London's second most competitive sector.[272] The BBC is a significant employer, while other broadcasters also have headquarters around the city. Many national newspapers are edited in London. London is a major retail centre and in 2010 had the highest non-food retail sales of any city in the world, with a total spend of around £64.2 billion.[273] The Port of London is the second-largest in the United Kingdom, handling 45 million tonnes of cargo each year.[274] A growing number of technology companies are based in London notably in East London Tech City, also known as Silicon Roundabout. In April 2014, the city was among the first to receive a geoTLD.[275][276][277] In February 2014 London was ranked as the European City of the Future[278] in the 2014/15 list by FDi Magazine.[279] The gas and electricity distribution networks that manage and operate the towers, cables and pressure systems that deliver energy to consumers across the city are managed by National Grid plc, SGN[280] and UK Power Networks.[281] Tourism Main article: Tourism in London The British MuseumThe National Gallery London is one of the leading tourist destinations in the world and in 2015 was ranked as the most visited city in the world with over 65 million visits.[282][283] It is also the top city in the world by visitor cross-border spending, estimated at US$20.23 billion in 2015.[284] Tourism is one of London's prime industries, employing 700,000 full-time workers in 2016, and contributes £36 billion a year to the economy.[285] The city accounts for 54% of all inbound visitor spending in the UK.[286] As of 2016[update] London was the world top city destination as ranked by TripAdvisor users.[287] In 2015 the top most-visited attractions in the UK were all in London. The top 10 most visited attractions were: (with visits per venue)[288] The British Museum: 6,820,686 The National Gallery: 5,908,254 The Natural History Museum (South Kensington): 5,284,023 The Southbank Centre: 5,102,883 Tate Modern: 4,712,581 The Victoria and Albert Museum (South Kensington): 3,432,325 The Science Museum: 3,356,212 Somerset House: 3,235,104 The Tower of London: 2,785,249 The National Portrait Gallery: 2,145,486 The number of hotel rooms in London in 2015 stood at 138,769, and is expected to grow over the years.[289] Transport Main articles: Transport in London and Infrastructure in London Journeys in Greater London by mode from 1997 to 2018[290] Black London taxis Transport is one of the four main areas of policy administered by the Mayor of London,[291] however the mayor's financial control does not extend to the longer distance rail network that enters London. In 2007 the Mayor of London assumed responsibility for some local lines, which now form the London Overground network, adding to the existing responsibility for the London Underground, trams and buses. The public transport network is administered by Transport for London (TfL).[292] The lines that formed the London Underground, as well as trams and buses, became part of an integrated transport system in 1933 when the London Passenger Transport Board or London Transport was created. Transport for London is now the statutory corporation responsible for most aspects of the transport system in Greater London, and is run by a board and a commissioner appointed by the Mayor of London.[293] Aviation Main article: Airports of London London Heathrow Airport is the busiest airport in Europe as well as the second busiest in the world for international passenger traffic. (Terminal 5C is pictured.) London is a major international air transport hub with the busiest city airspace in the world. Eight airports use the word London in their name, but most traffic passes through six of these. Additionally, various other airports also serve London, catering primarily to general aviation flights. London Heathrow Airport, in Hillingdon, West London, was for many years the busiest airport in the world for international traffic, and is the major hub of the nation's flag carrier, British Airways.[294] In March 2008 its fifth terminal was opened.[295] In 2014, Dubai gained from Heathrow the leading position in terms of international passenger traffic.[296] London Gatwick Airport,[297] south of London in West Sussex, handles flights to more destinations than any other UK airport[298] and is the main base of easyJet,[299] the UK's largest airline by number of passengers.[300] London Stansted Airport,[301] north-east of London in Essex, has flights that serve the greatest number of European destinations of any UK airport[302] and is the main base of Ryanair,[303] the world's largest international airline by number of international passengers.[304] London Luton Airport, to the north of London in Bedfordshire, is used by several budget airlines for short-haul flights.[305] London City Airport, the most central airport and the one with the shortest runway, in Newham, East London, is focused on business travellers, with a mixture of full-service short-haul scheduled flights and considerable business jet traffic.[306] London Southend Airport, east of London in Essex, is a smaller, regional airport that caters for short-haul flights on a limited, though growing, number of airlines.[307] In 2017, international passengers made up over 95% of the total at Southend, the highest proportion of any London airport.[308] Rail Underground and DLR The London Underground is the world's oldest and third-longest rapid transit system. The London Underground, commonly referred to as the Tube, is the oldest[309] and third longest[310] metro system in the world. The system serves 270 stations[311] and was formed from several private companies, including the world's first underground electric line, the City and South London Railway.[312] It dates from 1863.[313] Over four million journeys are made every day on the Underground network, over 1 billion each year.[314] An investment programme is attempting to reduce congestion and improve reliability, including £6.5 billion (€7.7 billion) spent before the 2012 Summer Olympics.[315] The Docklands Light Railway (DLR), which opened in 1987, is a second, more local metro system using smaller and lighter tram-type vehicles that serve the Docklands, Greenwich and Lewisham. Suburban There are more than 360 railway stations in the London Travelcard Zones on an extensive above-ground suburban railway network. South London, particularly, has a high concentration of railways as it has fewer Underground lines. Most rail lines terminate around the centre of London, running into eighteen terminal stations, with the exception of the Thameslink trains connecting Bedford in the north and Brighton in the south via Luton and Gatwick airports.[316] London has Britain's busiest station by number of passengers—Waterloo, with over 184 million people using the interchange station complex (which includes Waterloo East station) each year.[317][318] Clapham Junction is the busiest station in Europe by the number of trains passing. With the need for more rail capacity in London, Crossrail is expected to open in 2021.[319] It will be a new railway line running east to west through London and into the Home Counties with a branch to Heathrow Airport.[320] It is Europe's biggest construction project, with a £15 billion projected cost.[321][322] Inter-city and international St Pancras International is the main terminal for high-speed Eurostar and High Speed 1 services, as well as commuter suburban Thameslink and inter-city East Midlands Railway services. London is the centre of the National Rail network, with 70 per cent of rail journeys starting or ending in London.[323] King's Cross station and Euston station, which are both in London, are the starting points of the East Coast Main Line and the West Coast Main Line—the two main railway lines in Britain—respectively. Like suburban rail services, regional and inter-city trains depart from several termini around the city centre, linking London with the rest of Britain including Aberdeen, Birmingham, Blackpool, Bradford, Brighton, Bristol, Cambridge, Cardiff, Carlisle, Chester, Coventry, Crewe, Derby, Doncaster, Dover, Edinburgh, Exeter, Glasgow, Holyhead (for Dublin), Hull, Lancaster, Leeds, Liverpool, Nottingham, Manchester, Newcastle upon Tyne, Norwich, Oxford, Peterborough, Plymouth, Portsmouth, Preston, Reading, Sheffield, Southampton, Sunderland, Stevenage, Swansea, Wolverhampton and York.[324] London also has convenient rail connections with airports out of Greater London. These airports include Birmingham Airport (via Birmingham International railway station), East Midlands Airport (via East Midlands Parkway railway station), Inverness Airport (via Inverness railway station), Leeds Bradford Airport (via Bradford Interchange or Leeds railway station) and Liverpool John Lennon Airport (via Liverpool South Parkway railway station).[324] Some international railway services to Continental Europe were operated during the 20th century as boat trains, such as the Admiraal de Ruijter to Amsterdam and the Night Ferry to Paris and Brussels. The opening of the Channel Tunnel in 1994 connected London directly to the continental rail network, allowing Eurostar services to begin. Since 2007, high-speed trains link St. Pancras International with Lille, Calais, Paris, Disneyland Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam and other European tourist destinations via the High Speed 1 rail link and the Channel Tunnel.[325] The first high-speed domestic trains started in June 2009 linking Kent to London.[326] There are plans for a second high speed line linking London to the Midlands, North West England, and Yorkshire. Freight Although rail freight levels are far down compared to their height, significant quantities of cargo are also carried into and out of London by rail; chiefly building materials and landfill waste. As a major hub of the British railway network, London's tracks also carry large amounts of freight for the other regions, such as container freight from the Channel Tunnel and English Channel ports, and nuclear waste for reprocessing at Sellafield.[327] Buses, coaches and trams A red double-decker bus London's bus network runs 24 hours a day, with about 9,300 vehicles, more than 675 bus routes and around 19,000 bus stops.[328] In 2019/20, the network had more than 2 billion commuter trips per year.[329] Since 2010 and average of £1.2 billion is taken in revenue each year.[330] London has one of the largest wheelchair-accessible networks in the world[331] and from the third quarter of 2007, became more accessible to hearing and visually impaired passengers as audio-visual announcements were introduced.[332] London's coach hub is Victoria Coach Station, an Art Deco building opened in 1932. The coach station was initially run by a group of coach companies under the name of London Coastal Coaches; however, in 1970 the service and station were included in the nationalisation of the country's coach services, becoming part of the National Bus Company. In 1988, the coach station was purchased by London Transport which then became Transport for London. Victoria Coach Station has weekly passenger numbers of over 200,000 and provides services across the UK and Europe.[333][failed verification] London has a modern tram network, known as Tramlink, centred on Croydon in South London. The network has 39 stops and four routes, and carried 28 million people in 2013.[334][335] Since June 2008, Transport for London has completely owned and operated Tramlink.[336] Cable car London's first and to date only cable car is the Emirates Air Line, which opened in June 2012. The cable car crosses the River Thames, and links Greenwich Peninsula and the Royal Docks in the east of the city. It is integrated with London's Oyster Card ticketing system, although the Emirates Air Line fares are not included in the Oyster daily capping.[337] It cost £60 million to build and can carry up to 2,500 passengers per hour in each direction at peak times. Similar to the Santander Cycles bike hire scheme, the cable car is sponsored in a 10-year deal by the airline Emirates.[338] Cycling Main article: Cycling in London Santander Cycle Hire near Victoria in Central London In the Greater London Area, around 670,000 people use a bike every day,[339] meaning around 7% of the total population of around 8.8 million use a bike on an average day.[340][341] This relatively low percentage of bicycle users may be due to the poor investments for cycling in London of about £110 million per year,[342] equating to around £12 per person, which can be compared to £22 in the Netherlands.[343] Cycling has become an increasingly popular way to get around London. The launch of a bicycle hire scheme in July 2010 was successful and generally well received.[344] Port and river boats The Port of London, once the largest in the world, is now only the second-largest in the United Kingdom, handling 45 million tonnes of cargo each year as of 2009.[274] Most of this cargo passes through the Port of Tilbury, outside the boundary of Greater London.[274] London has river boat services on the Thames known as Thames Clippers, which offer both commuter and tourist boat services.[345] At major piers including Canary Wharf, London Bridge City, Battersea Power Station and London Eye (Waterloo), services depart at least every 20 minutes during commuter times.[346] The Woolwich Ferry, with 2.5 million passengers every year, is a frequent service linking the North and South Circular Roads.[347] Roads Although the majority of journeys in central London are made by public transport, car travel is common in the suburbs. The inner ring road (around the city centre), the North and South Circular roads (just within the suburbs), and the outer orbital motorway (the M25, just outside the built-up area in most places) encircle the city and are intersected by a number of busy radial routes—but very few motorways penetrate into inner London. A plan for a comprehensive network of motorways throughout the city (the Ringways Plan) was prepared in the 1960s but was mostly cancelled in the early 1970s.[348] The M25 is the second-longest ring-road motorway in Europe at 117 mi (188 km) long.[349] The A1 and M1 connect London to Leeds, and Newcastle and Edinburgh. London is notorious for its traffic congestion; in 2009, the average speed of a car in the rush hour was recorded at 10.6 mph (17.1 km/h).[350] In 2003, a congestion charge was introduced to reduce traffic volumes in the city centre. With a few exceptions, motorists are required to pay to drive within a defined zone encompassing much of central London.[351] Motorists who are residents of the defined zone can buy a greatly reduced season pass.[352][353] The London government initially expected the Congestion Charge Zone to increase daily peak period Underground and bus users, reduce road traffic, increase traffic speeds, and reduce queues;[354] however, the increase in private for hire vehicles has affected these expectations. Over the course of several years, the average number of cars entering the centre of London on a weekday was reduced from 195,000 to 125,000 cars – a 35-per-cent reduction of vehicles driven per day.[355][356] Education Main article: Education in London Tertiary education See also: List of universities and higher education colleges in London Imperial College London, a technical research university in South Kensington London is a major global centre of higher education teaching and research and has the largest concentration of higher education institutes in Europe.[22] According to the QS World University Rankings 2015/16, London has the greatest concentration of top class universities in the world[357][358] and its international student population of around 110,000 is larger than any other city in the world.[359] A 2014 PricewaterhouseCoopers report termed London the global capital of higher education.[360] King's College London, established by Royal Charter in 1829, is one of the founding colleges of the University of London.

Writers closely associated with the city are the diarist Samuel Pepys, noted for his eyewitness account of the Great Fire; Charles Dickens, whose representation of a foggy, snowy, grimy London of street sweepers and pickpockets has been a major influence on people's vision of early Victorian London; and Virginia Woolf, regarded as one of the foremost modernist literary figures of the 20th century.[384] Later important depictions of London from the 19th and early 20th centuries are Dickens' novels, and Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories.[384] Also of significance is Letitia Elizabeth Landon's Calendar of the London Seasons (1834). Modern writers pervasively influenced by the city include Peter Ackroyd, author of a ""biography"" of London, and Iain Sinclair, who writes in the genre of psychogeography.

London is home to many museums, galleries, and other institutions, many of which are free of admission charges and are major tourist attractions as well as playing a research role. The first of these to be established was the British Museum in Bloomsbury, in 1753.[387] Originally containing antiquities, natural history specimens, and the national library, the museum now has 7 million artefacts from around the globe. In 1824, the National Gallery was founded to house the British national collection of Western paintings; this now occupies a prominent position in Trafalgar Square. The British Library is the second largest library in the world, and the national library of the United Kingdom.[388][389][390] There are many other research libraries, including the Wellcome Library and Dana Centre, as well as university libraries, including the British Library of Political and Economic Science at LSE, the Central Library at Imperial, the Maughan Library at King's, and the Senate House Libraries at the University of London.[391][392] In the latter half of the 19th century the locale of South Kensington was developed as ""Albertopolis"", a cultural and scientific quarter. Three major national museums are there: the Victoria and Albert Museum (for the applied arts), the Natural History Museum, and the Science Museum. The National Portrait Gallery was founded in 1856 to house depictions of figures from British history; its holdings now comprise the world's most extensive collection of portraits.[393] The national gallery of British art is at Tate Britain, originally established as an annexe of the National Gallery in 1897. The Tate Gallery, as it was formerly known, also became a major centre for modern art.

It was originally taught within the Senior Department.[6] In 1839, teaching transferred to the Department of General Literature and Science in response to the need for a greater differentiation of the syllabus for students of the Senior Department at the King's.[6][7] Law became part of a broad faculty of subjects and classes that provided a core liberal syllabus in the arts and sciences available to all students of King's.[7] From 1893, it was known as the Division of Laws and Economics under the Faculty of Arts.[6] The Faculty of Laws was founded in 1909 and became known as the School of Law in 1991.[6] The school took its current name in 2012 in recognition of Hong Kong businessman Sir Dickson Poon, who made a gift of £20 million to the school. It is thought to be the largest-ever donation to a British or European law faculty at the time.[8] The school is in the heart of legal London. It was previously housed in a row of buildings adjacent to the Strand and Embankment along the River Thames. On 7 December 2009, it was announced that the school would relocate to the East Wing of Somerset House, a prominent example of neo-classical architecture, designed by Sir William Chambers in the late eighteenth century on the site of an earlier Tudor palace. Negotiations for the new lease are said to have taken some 180 years.[9][10] In February 2012, the refurbished East Wing was officially opened by the patron of the college, Queen Elizabeth II.[11] The first dean of the school was David Caron,[12] formerly of the University of California, Berkeley. Caron's appointment followed the renaming of the school and its new focus on transnational law. The school is also one of the ten international law schools that are members of the Center for Transnational Legal Studies (CTLS). Caron describes the typical graduate of the school as ""a transnational, global, lawyer with [...] roots in the historic tradition of the English common law that has influenced, and in turn been influenced by, much of the world, and in the more recent tradition of European Union law. They 'think global' because we teach them with a transnational perspective.""[13] Education[edit] The Maughan Library on Chancery Lane, across from the Law Society and the Royal Courts of Justice, houses the school's law library. The school provides legal instruction at undergraduate and graduate levels. It offers a three-year undergraduate LLB programme. Candidates are required to take the National Admissions Test for Law (LNAT) as part of the admissions process. In addition to the three-year undergraduate LLB, the school offers a number of joint programmes with partner institutions around the world including the United States (Columbia University), France (Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne), Germany (Humboldt University), Hong Kong (University of Hong Kong), and Australia (Monash University). The school offers a four-year LLB in law with transnational legal studies as part of its work with the Centre for Transnational Legal Studies. In 2012, the school saw the admission of its first cohort for its LLB in philosophy, politics, and law, a four-year multi-disciplinary degree that will build on the work of the Yeoh Tiong Lay Centre for Philosophy, Politics & Law. The school also offers Ivy-League style scholarships based on academic merit awarded to students who demonstrate academic excellence, outstanding potential, and life ambition.[14][15][16] Graduate programmes include full-time and part-time LLM and MA programmes, as well as distance-learning courses for legal practitioners. Since 2007 the school has conferred its own Master of Laws (LLM) degree, having previously been a contributor to the University of London intercollegiate programme. Those who study for the degree may elect to take a specialisation in one of several of the school's strengths, including international commercial law, international financial law and European Union law. The school also offers a dual degree with ESSEC Business School in France[17] and the Global School of Law in Lisbon.[18] The school offers a full-time graduate research programme leading to the award of the PhD in law. The school has 80 doctoral researchers. The school has hosted the annual International Graduate Legal Research Conference since 2007. The Graduate Legal Research Society arranges educational and social events for the doctoral researcher community and liaises with school management on behalf of the community. Finally, the school is one of six constituent law faculties within the University of London - along with those of University College London, the London School of Economics, Queen Mary University London, the School of Oriental & African Studies and Birkbeck, University of London - that collectively oversee and examine an intercollegiate LLB offered by distance learning and awarded by the university at large through its University of London Worldwide scheme. One of the largest legal education programs by enrollment globally, it lays claim to being the oldest LLB program grounded in the law of England & Wales with roots dating to the 1890's. Research[edit] The school is host to research projects funded by the British Academy, the Economic and Social Research Council, and the European Commission. The school includes various research centres and groups which serve as focal points for research activity. These include the Centre of European Law, established in 1974, the Centre of Medical Law and Ethics, established in 1978, and the Centre of British Constitutional Law and History, established in 1988. In 2013, the Yeoh Tiong Lay Centre for Politics, Philosophy & Law was established following a £7 million gift from Mark Yeoh (LLB graduate) and his family.[19] The school has undertaken significant investment in the field of transnational law in recent years and has established an Institute of Transnational Law led by Peer Zumbansen. Publications[edit] The school publishes the scholarly King's Law Journal, as well as the King's Student Law Review. The Centre of European Law publishes a paper series, Working Papers in European Law. The International State Crime Initiative publishes a range of reports, commentaries, and other materials on state crime. The faculty at the school are regular authors of monographs, scholarly treatises and articles, and contributions to periodicals. Latest publications from the Dickson Poon School of Law are available on King's Research Portal.[20] Reputation[edit] It is one of the highest ranked institutions for the study of law in the United Kingdom and the world.[3] In 2020, the Dickson Poon School of Law ranked 15th in the world and 4th in Europe in the QS World University Rankings.[21] Notable faculty[edit] Ben Bowling, professor of criminology and criminal justice and former acting dean of the Dickson Poon School of Law David Caron, professor of law and former dean of the Dickson Poon School of Law Gillian Douglas, professor of family law and dean of the Dickson Poon School of Law Keith Ewing, professor of public law Sir Francis Jacobs, professor of European law and president of the Centre for European Law[22] Igor Judge, Baron Judge, Dickson Poon distinguished visitor, Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales (2008-2013), convenor of the Crossbench Peers in the House of Lords Lady Hale, visiting professor, president of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom (2017-2020) Toby Landau, QC, visiting professor, a renowned British lawyer and arbitration expert[23] Eva Lomnicka, visiting professor Aileen McColgan, professor of human rights law John Phillips, professor of law Nicholas Phillips, Baron Phillips of Worth Matravers, Dickson Poon distinguished visitor Raymond Plant, Baron Plant of Highfield, professor of law Joseph Raz, research professor of jurisprudence Takis Tridimas, professor of European law John Tasioulas, professor of politics, philosophy and law and director of the Yeoh Tiong Lay Centre for Politics, Philosophy & Law Samuel Wordsworth, QC, visiting professor, the leading public international law silk[24] Peer Zumbansen, professor of transnational law and director of the Transnational Law Institute Notable alumni[edit] See also: List of King's College London alumni Abd al-Rahman al-Bazzaz Magnus Brunner Michael Collins Abdulai Conteh Christopher de Souza Lord Dunlop Jerome Fitzgerald Marlene Malahoo Forte Muhammad Zafarullah Khan Dennis Kwok Brandon Lewis Anne McLellan Trevor Moniz Tassos Papadopoulos France-Albert René Patrick Lipton Robinson Michael Kijana Wamalwa Karim Khan, Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court Shafique Ahmed, Bangladeshi Justice Minister Michael Ashikodi Agbamuche, Attorney General & Minister for Justice of Nigeria (1994–97) Brian Altman, lead Counsel for the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse Georgios Anastassopoulos, Greek MEP Dame Geraldine Andrews, High Court Judge (2013–) Sir Robin Auld, Lord Justice of Appeal Ziad Bahaa-Eldin, Deputy Prime Minister of Egypt Abd al-Rahman al-Bazzaz, Prime Minister of Iraq (1965–66) Godfrey Binaisa, President of Uganda (1979–80) Sir Patrick Bishop, Conservative Member of Parliament Sir Louis Blom-Cooper, author and lawyer Harold Bollers, Chief Justice of Guyana (1966–80) Terence Boston, Baron Boston of Faversham, Labour Member of Parliament and Crossbench peer Magnus Brunner, Member of the Austrian Federal Council Haresh Budhrani, Speaker of the Gibraltar Parliament Alex Carlile, Baron Carlile of Berriew Dame Bobbie Cheema-Grubb, High Court Judge (2015–) Sir Fielding Clarke, Chief Justice of Fiji, Hong Kong and Jamaica Glafcos Clerides, President of Cyprus (1993–2003) Stanley Clinton-Davis, Baron Clinton-Davis, Labour Member of Parliament and peer and UK EU Commissioner Michael Collins - Chairman of the Irish Provisional Government (1922) Abdulai Conteh, Vice President of Sierra Leone Philippe Couvreur, Registrar of the International Court of Justice Edmund Davies, Baron Edmund-Davies, Lord of Appeal in Ordinary (1974–1981) Segun Toyin Dawodu - Attorney, Physician and founder of Dawodu.com (Premier website on Nigeria's history and socio-political issues) Sushmita Dev, Member of the Indian Lok Sabha Andrew Dunlop, Baron Dunlop, Conservative peer Jerome Fitzgerald, Bahamian Education Minister Marlene Malahoo Forte, Attorney General of Jamaica Sir David Foskett, High Court Judge (2007–) Sir Cyril Fountain, Chief Justice of the Bahamas Alan Ganoo, Speaker of the National Assembly of Mauritius Harry Gem, inventor of the lawn tennis Colleen Graffy, US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Dame Katherine Grainger, Olympic gold medal winning rower Faisal Saleh Hayat, Pakistani Interior Minister Anisul Huq, Bangladeshi Justice Minister Chukwunweike Idigbe, Justice of the Supreme Court of Nigeria Faizah Jamal, Member of the Singaporean Parliament K.

It is situated on the Strand in the East Wing of Somerset House, in close proximity to the Royal Courts of Justice and the four Inns of Court in the heart of London's legal quarter. It has been ranked in the top 15 law schools in the world,[3] and fourth in the UK.[4] Following a donation of £20 million by Dickson Poon in 2012, the school was renamed in his honour.[5] The current dean of the school is Professor Gillian Douglas. Contents 1 History 2 Education 3 Research 4 Publications 5 Reputation 6 Notable faculty 7 Notable alumni 8 References 9 External links History[edit] Law has been taught at King's College London since 1831. It was originally taught within the Senior Department.[6] In 1839, teaching transferred to the Department of General Literature and Science in response to the need for a greater differentiation of the syllabus for students of the Senior Department at the King's.[6][7] Law became part of a broad faculty of subjects and classes that provided a core liberal syllabus in the arts and sciences available to all students of King's.[7] From 1893, it was known as the Division of Laws and Economics under the Faculty of Arts.[6] The Faculty of Laws was founded in 1909 and became known as the School of Law in 1991.[6] The school took its current name in 2012 in recognition of Hong Kong businessman Sir Dickson Poon, who made a gift of £20 million to the school. It is thought to be the largest-ever donation to a British or European law faculty at the time.[8] The school is in the heart of legal London. It was previously housed in a row of buildings adjacent to the Strand and Embankment along the River Thames. On 7 December 2009, it was announced that the school would relocate to the East Wing of Somerset House, a prominent example of neo-classical architecture, designed by Sir William Chambers in the late eighteenth century on the site of an earlier Tudor palace. Negotiations for the new lease are said to have taken some 180 years.[9][10] In February 2012, the refurbished East Wing was officially opened by the patron of the college, Queen Elizabeth II.[11] The first dean of the school was David Caron,[12] formerly of the University of California, Berkeley. Caron's appointment followed the renaming of the school and its new focus on transnational law. The school is also one of the ten international law schools that are members of the Center for Transnational Legal Studies (CTLS). Caron describes the typical graduate of the school as ""a transnational, global, lawyer with [...] roots in the historic tradition of the English common law that has influenced, and in turn been influenced by, much of the world, and in the more recent tradition of European Union law. They 'think global' because we teach them with a transnational perspective.""[13] Education[edit] The Maughan Library on Chancery Lane, across from the Law Society and the Royal Courts of Justice, houses the school's law library. The school provides legal instruction at undergraduate and graduate levels. It offers a three-year undergraduate LLB programme. Candidates are required to take the National Admissions Test for Law (LNAT) as part of the admissions process. In addition to the three-year undergraduate LLB, the school offers a number of joint programmes with partner institutions around the world including the United States (Columbia University), France (Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne), Germany (Humboldt University), Hong Kong (University of Hong Kong), and Australia (Monash University). The school offers a four-year LLB in law with transnational legal studies as part of its work with the Centre for Transnational Legal Studies. In 2012, the school saw the admission of its first cohort for its LLB in philosophy, politics, and law, a four-year multi-disciplinary degree that will build on the work of the Yeoh Tiong Lay Centre for Philosophy, Politics & Law. The school also offers Ivy-League style scholarships based on academic merit awarded to students who demonstrate academic excellence, outstanding potential, and life ambition.[14][15][16] Graduate programmes include full-time and part-time LLM and MA programmes, as well as distance-learning courses for legal practitioners. Since 2007 the school has conferred its own Master of Laws (LLM) degree, having previously been a contributor to the University of London intercollegiate programme. Those who study for the degree may elect to take a specialisation in one of several of the school's strengths, including international commercial law, international financial law and European Union law. The school also offers a dual degree with ESSEC Business School in France[17] and the Global School of Law in Lisbon.[18] The school offers a full-time graduate research programme leading to the award of the PhD in law. The school has 80 doctoral researchers. The school has hosted the annual International Graduate Legal Research Conference since 2007. The Graduate Legal Research Society arranges educational and social events for the doctoral researcher community and liaises with school management on behalf of the community. Finally, the school is one of six constituent law faculties within the University of London - along with those of University College London, the London School of Economics, Queen Mary University London, the School of Oriental & African Studies and Birkbeck, University of London - that collectively oversee and examine an intercollegiate LLB offered by distance learning and awarded by the university at large through its University of London Worldwide scheme. One of the largest legal education programs by enrollment globally, it lays claim to being the oldest LLB program grounded in the law of England & Wales with roots dating to the 1890's. Research[edit] The school is host to research projects funded by the British Academy, the Economic and Social Research Council, and the European Commission. The school includes various research centres and groups which serve as focal points for research activity. These include the Centre of European Law, established in 1974, the Centre of Medical Law and Ethics, established in 1978, and the Centre of British Constitutional Law and History, established in 1988. In 2013, the Yeoh Tiong Lay Centre for Politics, Philosophy & Law was established following a £7 million gift from Mark Yeoh (LLB graduate) and his family.[19] The school has undertaken significant investment in the field of transnational law in recent years and has established an Institute of Transnational Law led by Peer Zumbansen. Publications[edit] The school publishes the scholarly King's Law Journal, as well as the King's Student Law Review. The Centre of European Law publishes a paper series, Working Papers in European Law. The International State Crime Initiative publishes a range of reports, commentaries, and other materials on state crime. The faculty at the school are regular authors of monographs, scholarly treatises and articles, and contributions to periodicals. Latest publications from the Dickson Poon School of Law are available on King's Research Portal.[20] Reputation[edit] It is one of the highest ranked institutions for the study of law in the United Kingdom and the world.[3] In 2020, the Dickson Poon School of Law ranked 15th in the world and 4th in Europe in the QS World University Rankings.[21] Notable faculty[edit] Ben Bowling, professor of criminology and criminal justice and former acting dean of the Dickson Poon School of Law David Caron, professor of law and former dean of the Dickson Poon School of Law Gillian Douglas, professor of family law and dean of the Dickson Poon School of Law Keith Ewing, professor of public law Sir Francis Jacobs, professor of European law and president of the Centre for European Law[22] Igor Judge, Baron Judge, Dickson Poon distinguished visitor, Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales (2008-2013), convenor of the Crossbench Peers in the House of Lords Lady Hale, visiting professor, president of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom (2017-2020) Toby Landau, QC, visiting professor, a renowned British lawyer and arbitration expert[23] Eva Lomnicka, visiting professor Aileen McColgan, professor of human rights law John Phillips, professor of law Nicholas Phillips, Baron Phillips of Worth Matravers, Dickson Poon distinguished visitor Raymond Plant, Baron Plant of Highfield, professor of law Joseph Raz, research professor of jurisprudence Takis Tridimas, professor of European law John Tasioulas, professor of politics, philosophy and law and director of the Yeoh Tiong Lay Centre for Politics, Philosophy & Law Samuel Wordsworth, QC, visiting professor, the leading public international law silk[24] Peer Zumbansen, professor of transnational law and director of the Transnational Law Institute Notable alumni[edit] See also: List of King's College London alumni Abd al-Rahman al-Bazzaz Magnus Brunner Michael Collins Abdulai Conteh Christopher de Souza Lord Dunlop Jerome Fitzgerald Marlene Malahoo Forte Muhammad Zafarullah Khan Dennis Kwok Brandon Lewis Anne McLellan Trevor Moniz Tassos Papadopoulos France-Albert René Patrick Lipton Robinson Michael Kijana Wamalwa Karim Khan, Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court Shafique Ahmed, Bangladeshi Justice Minister Michael Ashikodi Agbamuche, Attorney General & Minister for Justice of Nigeria (1994–97) Brian Altman, lead Counsel for the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse Georgios Anastassopoulos, Greek MEP Dame Geraldine Andrews, High Court Judge (2013–) Sir Robin Auld, Lord Justice of Appeal Ziad Bahaa-Eldin, Deputy Prime Minister of Egypt Abd al-Rahman al-Bazzaz, Prime Minister of Iraq (1965–66) Godfrey Binaisa, President of Uganda (1979–80) Sir Patrick Bishop, Conservative Member of Parliament Sir Louis Blom-Cooper, author and lawyer Harold Bollers, Chief Justice of Guyana (1966–80) Terence Boston, Baron Boston of Faversham, Labour Member of Parliament and Crossbench peer Magnus Brunner, Member of the Austrian Federal Council Haresh Budhrani, Speaker of the Gibraltar Parliament Alex Carlile, Baron Carlile of Berriew Dame Bobbie Cheema-Grubb, High Court Judge (2015–) Sir Fielding Clarke, Chief Justice of Fiji, Hong Kong and Jamaica Glafcos Clerides, President of Cyprus (1993–2003) Stanley Clinton-Davis, Baron Clinton-Davis, Labour Member of Parliament and peer and UK EU Commissioner Michael Collins - Chairman of the Irish Provisional Government (1922) Abdulai Conteh, Vice President of Sierra Leone Philippe Couvreur, Registrar of the International Court of Justice Edmund Davies, Baron Edmund-Davies, Lord of Appeal in Ordinary (1974–1981) Segun Toyin Dawodu - Attorney, Physician and founder of Dawodu.com (Premier website on Nigeria's history and socio-political issues) Sushmita Dev, Member of the Indian Lok Sabha Andrew Dunlop, Baron Dunlop, Conservative peer Jerome Fitzgerald, Bahamian Education Minister Marlene Malahoo Forte, Attorney General of Jamaica Sir David Foskett, High Court Judge (2007–) Sir Cyril Fountain, Chief Justice of the Bahamas Alan Ganoo, Speaker of the National Assembly of Mauritius Harry Gem, inventor of the lawn tennis Colleen Graffy, US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Dame Katherine Grainger, Olympic gold medal winning rower Faisal Saleh Hayat, Pakistani Interior Minister Anisul Huq, Bangladeshi Justice Minister Chukwunweike Idigbe, Justice of the Supreme Court of Nigeria Faizah Jamal, Member of the Singaporean Parliament K.

The KAS is a political foundation, closely associated with the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU) Through civic education activities in Germany and in over 120 countries we want to make a contribution to get closer to a world of peace, freedom and justice. The promotion of democracy, the intensification of the transatlantic relationship and development cooperation are our mayor goals. As a think tank and advisory agency we elaborate profound analysis to guide political action. The KAS New York office opened its doors in 2016 as part of the foundation´s Multinational Development Dialogue program. The office serves as a liaison between KAS offices with their experts and local partners and the United Nations. Although the New York office focuses on the world organization as a whole, these four topics are at the center of the foundation´s work in New York: Foreign- and Security Policy, conflict management Development policy Policy on climate change and energy security Rule of law The KAS New York office regularly hosts dialog programs with experts from the KAS offices all over the world, including talks, discussions, workshops and conferences to enhance the exchange of ideas between the foundation´s network of partners and experts and different UN bodies, but also with national and international think tanks, NPOs and universities in New York. In addition, these programs provide discussions on most relevant topics to an interested audience in New York. Furthermore, we also elaborate position papers and analysis about the work of the UN to provide our field offices and partners and the interested general public with first-hand information about the world organisation.

Berlin's urban area, which has a population of around 4.5 million, is the second most populous urban area in Germany after the Ruhr.[3] The Berlin-Brandenburg capital region has over six million inhabitants and is Germany's third-largest metropolitan region after the Rhine-Ruhr and Rhine-Main regions.[10] Berlin straddles the banks of the Spree, which flows into the Havel (a tributary of the Elbe) in the western borough of Spandau. Among the city's main topographical features are the many lakes in the western and southeastern boroughs formed by the Spree, Havel and Dahme, the largest of which is Lake Müggelsee. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. About one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers, canals and lakes.[11] The city lies in the Central German dialect area, the Berlin dialect being a variant of the Lusatian-New Marchian dialects. First documented in the 13th century and at the crossing of two important historic trade routes,[12] Berlin became the capital of the Margraviate of Brandenburg (1417–1701), the Kingdom of Prussia (1701–1918), the German Empire (1871–1918), the Weimar Republic (1919–1933), and the Third Reich (1933–1945). Berlin in the 1920s was the third-largest municipality in the world.[13] After World War II and its subsequent occupation by the victorious countries, the city was divided; West Berlin became a de facto exclave of West Germany, surrounded by the Berlin Wall (1961–1989) and East German territory.[14] East Berlin was declared capital of East Germany, while Bonn became the West German capital. Following German reunification in 1990, Berlin once again became the capital of all of Germany. Berlin is a world city of culture, politics, media and science.[15][16][17][18] Its economy is based on high-tech firms and the service sector, encompassing a diverse range of creative industries, research facilities, media corporations and convention venues.[19][20] Berlin serves as a continental hub for air and rail traffic and has a highly complex public transportation network. The metropolis is a popular tourist destination.[21] Significant industries also include IT, pharmaceuticals, biomedical engineering, clean tech, biotechnology, construction and electronics. Berlin is home to world-renowned universities such as the Humboldt Universität zu Berlin (HU Berlin), the Technische Universität Berlin (TU Berlin), the Freie Universität Berlin (Free University of Berlin), the Universität der Künste (University of the Arts, UdK) ESMT Berlin and Bard College Berlin. Its Zoological Garden is the most visited zoo in Europe and one of the most popular worldwide. With the world's oldest large-scale movie studio complex, Berlin is an increasingly popular location for international film productions.[22] The city is well known for its festivals, diverse architecture, nightlife, contemporary arts and a very high quality of living.[23] Since the 2000s Berlin has seen the emergence of a cosmopolitan entrepreneurial scene.[24] Berlin contains three World Heritage Sites: Museum Island; the Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin; and the Berlin Modernism Housing Estates.[25] Other landmarks include the Brandenburg Gate, the Reichstag building, Potsdamer Platz, the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, the Berlin Wall Memorial, the East Side Gallery, the Berlin Victory Column, Berlin Cathedral and the Berlin Television Tower, the tallest structure in Germany. Berlin has numerous museums, galleries, libraries, orchestras, and sporting events. These include the Old National Gallery, the Bode Museum, the Pergamon Museum, the German Historical Museum, the Jewish Museum Berlin, the Natural History Museum, the Humboldt Forum, the Berlin State Library, the Berlin State Opera, the Berlin Philharmonic and the Berlin Marathon.

While the Frankish Realm was primarily inhabited by Germanic tribes like the Franks and the Saxons, the regions east of the border rivers were inhabited by Slavic tribes. This is why most of the cities and villages in northeastern Germany bear Slavic-derived names (Germania Slavica). Typical Germanized place name suffixes of Slavic origin are -ow, -itz, -vitz, -witz, -itzsch and -in, prefixes are Windisch and Wendisch. The name Berlin has its roots in the language of West Slavic inhabitants of the area of today's Berlin, and may be related to the Old Polabian stem berl-/birl- (""swamp"").[26] Since the Ber- at the beginning sounds like the German word Bär (bear), a bear appears in the coat of arms of the city. It is therefore an example of canting arms. Of Berlin's twelve boroughs, five bear a (partly) Slavic-derived name: Pankow (the most populous), Steglitz-Zehlendorf, Marzahn-Hellersdorf, Treptow-Köpenick and Spandau (named Spandow until 1878). Of its ninety-six neighborhoods, twenty-two bear a (partly) Slavic-derived name: Altglienicke, Alt-Treptow, Britz, Buch, Buckow, Gatow, Karow, Kladow, Köpenick, Lankwitz, Lübars, Malchow, Marzahn, Pankow, Prenzlauer Berg, Rudow, Schmöckwitz, Spandau, Stadtrandsiedlung Malchow, Steglitz, Tegel and Zehlendorf. The neighborhood of Moabit bears a French-derived name, and Französisch Buchholz is named after the Huguenots. 12th to 16th centuries[edit] Map of Berlin in 1688 Berlin Cathedral (left) and Berlin Palace (right), 1900 The earliest evidence of settlements in the area of today's Berlin are remnants of a house foundation dated to 1174, found in excavations in Berlin Mitte,[27] and a wooden beam dated from approximately 1192.[28] The first written records of towns in the area of present-day Berlin date from the late 12th century. Spandau is first mentioned in 1197 and Köpenick in 1209, although these areas did not join Berlin until 1920.[29] The central part of Berlin can be traced back to two towns. Cölln on the Fischerinsel is first mentioned in a 1237 document, and Berlin, across the Spree in what is now called the Nikolaiviertel, is referenced in a document from 1244.[28] 1237 is considered the founding date of the city.[30] The two towns over time formed close economic and social ties, and profited from the staple right on the two important trade routes Via Imperii and from Bruges to Novgorod.[12] In 1307, they formed an alliance with a common external policy, their internal administrations still being separated.[31][32] In 1415, Frederick I became the elector of the Margraviate of Brandenburg, which he ruled until 1440.[33] During the 15th century, his successors established Berlin-Cölln as capital of the margraviate, and subsequent members of the Hohenzollern family ruled in Berlin until 1918, first as electors of Brandenburg, then as kings of Prussia, and eventually as German emperors. In 1443, Frederick II Irontooth started the construction of a new royal palace in the twin city Berlin-Cölln. The protests of the town citizens against the building culminated in 1448, in the ""Berlin Indignation"" (""Berliner Unwille"").[34][35] This protest was not successful and the citizenry lost many of its political and economic privileges. After the royal palace was finished in 1451, it gradually came into use. From 1470, with the new elector Albrecht III Achilles, Berlin-Cölln became the new royal residence.[32] Officially, the Berlin-Cölln palace became permanent residence of the Brandenburg electors of the Hohenzollerns from 1486, when John Cicero came to power.[36] Berlin-Cölln, however, had to give up its status as a free Hanseatic city. In 1539, the electors and the city officially became Lutheran.[37] 17th to 19th centuries[edit] The Thirty Years' War between 1618 and 1648 devastated Berlin. One third of its houses were damaged or destroyed, and the city lost half of its population.[38] Frederick William, known as the ""Great Elector"", who had succeeded his father George William as ruler in 1640, initiated a policy of promoting immigration and religious tolerance.[39] With the Edict of Potsdam in 1685, Frederick William offered asylum to the French Huguenots.[40] By 1700, approximately 30 percent of Berlin's residents were French, because of the Huguenot immigration.[41] Many other immigrants came from Bohemia, Poland, and Salzburg.[42] Berlin became the capital of the German Empire in 1871 and expanded rapidly in the following years. Since 1618, the Margraviate of Brandenburg had been in personal union with the Duchy of Prussia. In 1701, the dual state formed the Kingdom of Prussia, as Frederick III, Elector of Brandenburg, crowned himself as king Frederick I in Prussia. Berlin became the capital of the new Kingdom,[43] replacing Königsberg. This was a successful attempt to centralise the capital in the very far-flung state, and it was the first time the city began to grow. In 1709, Berlin merged with the four cities of Cölln, Friedrichswerder, Friedrichstadt and Dorotheenstadt under the name Berlin, ""Haupt- und Residenzstadt Berlin"".[31] In 1740, Frederick II, known as Frederick the Great (1740–1786), came to power.[44] Under the rule of Frederick II, Berlin became a center of the Enlightenment, but also, was briefly occupied during the Seven Years' War by the Russian army.[45] Following France's victory in the War of the Fourth Coalition, Napoleon Bonaparte marched into Berlin in 1806, but granted self-government to the city.[46] In 1815, the city became part of the new Province of Brandenburg.[47] The Industrial Revolution transformed Berlin during the 19th century; the city's economy and population expanded dramatically, and it became the main railway hub and economic center of Germany. Additional suburbs soon developed and increased the area and population of Berlin. In 1861, neighboring suburbs including Wedding, Moabit and several others were incorporated into Berlin.[48] In 1871, Berlin became capital of the newly founded German Empire.[49] In 1881, it became a city district separate from Brandenburg.[50] 20th to 21st centuries[edit] Further information: 1920s Berlin, West Berlin, and East Berlin In the early 20th century, Berlin had become a fertile ground for the German Expressionist movement.[51] In fields such as architecture, painting and cinema new forms of artistic styles were invented. At the end of the First World War in 1918, a republic was proclaimed by Philipp Scheidemann at the Reichstag building. In 1920, the Greater Berlin Act incorporated dozens of suburban cities, villages, and estates around Berlin into an expanded city. The act increased the area of Berlin from 66 to 883 km2 (25 to 341 sq mi). The population almost doubled, and Berlin had a population of around four million. During the Weimar era, Berlin underwent political unrest due to economic uncertainties but also became a renowned center of the Roaring Twenties. The metropolis experienced its heyday as a major world capital and was known for its leadership roles in science, technology, arts, the humanities, city planning, film, higher education, government, and industries. Albert Einstein rose to public prominence during his years in Berlin, being awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1921. Berlin in ruins after World War II (Potsdamer Platz, 1945) In 1933, Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party came to power. NSDAP rule diminished Berlin's Jewish community from 160,000 (one-third of all Jews in the country) to about 80,000 due to emigration between 1933 and 1939. After Kristallnacht in 1938, thousands of the city's Jews were imprisoned in the nearby Sachsenhausen concentration camp. Starting in early 1943, many were shipped to concentration camps, such as Auschwitz.[52] Berlin is the most heavily bombed city in history.[citation needed] During World War II, large parts of Berlin were destroyed during 1943–45 Allied air raids and the 1945 Battle of Berlin. The Allies dropped 67,607 tons of bombs on the city, destroying 6,427 acres of the built-up area. Around 125,000 civilians were killed.[53] After the end of the war in Europe in May 1945, Berlin received large numbers of refugees from the Eastern provinces. The victorious powers divided the city into four sectors, analogous to the occupation zones into which Germany was divided. The sectors of the Western Allies (the United States, the United Kingdom, and France) formed West Berlin, while the Soviet sector formed East Berlin.[54] The Berlin Wall (painted on the western side) was a barrier that divided the city from 1961 to 1989. All four Allies shared administrative responsibilities for Berlin. However, in 1948, when the Western Allies extended the currency reform in the Western zones of Germany to the three western sectors of Berlin, the Soviet Union imposed a blockade on the access routes to and from West Berlin, which lay entirely inside Soviet-controlled territory. The Berlin airlift, conducted by the three western Allies, overcame this blockade by supplying food and other supplies to the city from June 1948 to May 1949.[55] In 1949, the Federal Republic of Germany was founded in West Germany and eventually included all of the American, British and French zones, excluding those three countries' zones in Berlin, while the Marxist-Leninist German Democratic Republic was proclaimed in East Germany. West Berlin officially remained an occupied city, but it politically was aligned with the Federal Republic of Germany despite West Berlin's geographic isolation. Airline service to West Berlin was granted only to American, British and French airlines. The fall of the Berlin Wall on 9 November 1989. On 3 October 1990, the German reunification process was formally finished. The founding of the two German states increased Cold War tensions. West Berlin was surrounded by East German territory, and East Germany proclaimed the Eastern part as its capital, a move the western powers did not recognize. East Berlin included most of the city's historic center. The West German government established itself in Bonn.[56] In 1961, East Germany began to build the Berlin Wall around West Berlin, and events escalated to a tank standoff at Checkpoint Charlie. West Berlin was now de facto a part of West Germany with a unique legal status, while East Berlin was de facto a part of East Germany. John F. Kennedy gave his ""Ich bin ein Berliner"" speech on June 26, 1963, in front of the Schöneberg city hall, located in the city's western part, underlining the US support for West Berlin.[57] Berlin was completely divided. Although it was possible for Westerners to pass to the other side through strictly controlled checkpoints, for most Easterners, travel to West Berlin or West Germany was prohibited by the government of East Germany. In 1971, a Four-Power agreement guaranteed access to and from West Berlin by car or train through East Germany.[58] In 1989, with the end of the Cold War and pressure from the East German population, the Berlin Wall fell on 9 November and was subsequently mostly demolished. Today, the East Side Gallery preserves a large portion of the wall. On 3 October 1990, the two parts of Germany were reunified as the Federal Republic of Germany, and Berlin again became a reunified city.[59] Walter Momper, the mayor of West Berlin, became the first mayor of the reunified city in the interim. City-wide elections in December 1990 resulted in the first ""all Berlin"" mayor being elected to take office in January 1991, with the separate offices of mayors in East and West Berlin expiring by that time, and Eberhard Diepgen (a former mayor of West Berlin) became the first elected mayor of a reunited Berlin.[60] On 18 June 1994, soldiers from the United States, France and Britain marched in a parade which was part of the ceremonies to mark the withdrawal of allied occupation troops allowing a reunified Berlin[61] (the last Russian troops departed on 31 August, while the final departure of Western Allies forces was on 8 September 1994). On 20 June 1991, the Bundestag (German Parliament) voted to move the seat of the German capital from Bonn to Berlin, which was completed in 1999. The rebuilt Berlin Palace nearing completion, in 2020 Berlin's 2001 administrative reform merged several boroughs, reducing their number from 23 to 12. In 2006, the FIFA World Cup Final was held in Berlin. In a 2016 terrorist attack linked to ISIL, a truck was deliberately driven into a Christmas market next to the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, leaving 12 people dead and 56 others injured.[62] Berlin Brandenburg Airport (BER) opened in 2020, nine years later than planned, with Terminal 1 coming into service at the end of October, and flights to and from Tegel Airport ending in November.[63] Due to the fall in passenger numbers resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, plans were announced to temporarily close BER's Terminal 5, the former Schönefeld Airport, beginning in March 2021 for up to one year.[64] The connecting link of U-Bahn line U5 from Alexanderplatz to Hauptbahnhof, along with the new stations Rotes Rathaus and Unter den Linden, opened on 4 December 2020, with the Museumsinsel U-Bahn station expected to open around March 2021, which would complete all new works on the U5.[65] A partial opening by the end of 2020 of the Humboldt Forum museum, housed in the reconstructed Berlin City Palace, which had been announced in June, was postponed until March 2021.[66] Geography[edit] Main article: Geography of Berlin Topography[edit] Satellite image of Berlin The outskirts of Berlin are covered with woodlands and numerous lakes. Berlin is in northeastern Germany, in an area of low-lying marshy woodlands with a mainly flat topography, part of the vast Northern European Plain which stretches all the way from northern France to western Russia. The Berliner Urstromtal (an ice age glacial valley), between the low Barnim Plateau to the north and the Teltow plateau to the south, was formed by meltwater flowing from ice sheets at the end of the last Weichselian glaciation. The Spree follows this valley now. In Spandau, a borough in the west of Berlin, the Spree empties into the river Havel, which flows from north to south through western Berlin. The course of the Havel is more like a chain of lakes, the largest being the Tegeler See and the Großer Wannsee. A series of lakes also feeds into the upper Spree, which flows through the Großer Müggelsee in eastern Berlin.[67] Substantial parts of present-day Berlin extend onto the low plateaus on both sides of the Spree Valley. Large parts of the boroughs Reinickendorf and Pankow lie on the Barnim Plateau, while most of the boroughs of Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf, Steglitz-Zehlendorf, Tempelhof-Schöneberg, and Neukölln lie on the Teltow Plateau. The borough of Spandau lies partly within the Berlin Glacial Valley and partly on the Nauen Plain, which stretches to the west of Berlin. Since 2015, the Arkenberge hills in Pankow at 122 meters (400 ft) elevation, have been the highest point in Berlin. Through the disposal of construction debris they surpassed Teufelsberg (120.1 m or 394 ft), which itself was made up of rubble from the ruins of the Second World War.[68] The Müggelberge at 114.7 meters (376 ft) elevation is the highest natural point and the lowest is the Spektesee in Spandau, at 28.1 meters (92 ft) elevation.[69] Climate[edit] Berlin has an oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb);[70] the eastern part of the city has a slight continental influence (Dfb), especially in the 0 °C isotherm, one of the changes being the annual rainfall according to the air masses and the greater abundance during a period of the year.[71][72] This type of climate features moderate summer temperatures but sometimes hot (for being semicontinental) and cold winters but not rigorous most of the time.[73][72] Due to its transitional climate zones, frosts are common in winter, and there are larger temperature differences between seasons than typical for many oceanic climates. Furthermore, Berlin is classified as a temperate continental climate (Dc) under the Trewartha climate scheme, as well as the suburbs of New York, although the Köppen system puts them in different types.[74] Summers are warm and sometimes humid with average high temperatures of 22–25 °C (72–77 °F) and lows of 12–14 °C (54–57 °F). Winters are cool with average high temperatures of 3 °C (37 °F) and lows of −2 to 0 °C (28 to 32 °F). Spring and autumn are generally chilly to mild. Berlin's built-up area creates a microclimate, with heat stored by the city's buildings and pavement. Temperatures can be 4 °C (7 °F) higher in the city than in the surrounding areas.[75] Annual precipitation is 570 millimeters (22 in) with moderate rainfall throughout the year. Snowfall mainly occurs from December through March.[76] The hottest month in Berlin was July 1834, with a mean temperature of 23.0 °C (73.4 °F) and the coldest was January 1709, with a mean temperature of −13.2 °C (8.2 °F).[77] The wettest month on record was July 1907, with 230 millimeters (9.1 in) of rainfall, whereas the driest were October 1866, November 1902, October 1908 and September 1928, all with 1 millimeter (0.039 in) of rainfall.[78] Climate data for Berlin (Schönefeld), 1981–2010 normals, extremes 1957–present Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °C (°F) 15.1(59.2) 18.0(64.4) 25.8(78.4) 30.8(87.4) 32.7(90.9) 35.4(95.7) 37.3(99.1) 38.0(100.4) 32.3(90.1) 27.7(81.9) 20.4(68.7) 15.6(60.1) 38.0(100.4) Average high °C (°F) 2.8(37.0) 4.3(39.7) 8.7(47.7) 14.3(57.7) 19.4(66.9) 22.0(71.6) 24.6(76.3) 24.2(75.6) 19.3(66.7) 13.8(56.8) 7.3(45.1) 3.3(37.9) 13.7(56.7) Daily mean °C (°F) 0.1(32.2) 0.9(33.6) 4.3(39.7) 9.0(48.2) 14.0(57.2) 16.8(62.2) 19.1(66.4) 18.5(65.3) 14.2(57.6) 9.4(48.9) 4.4(39.9) 1.0(33.8) 9.3(48.7) Average low °C (°F) −2.8(27.0) −2.4(27.7) 0.4(32.7) 3.5(38.3) 8.2(46.8) 11.2(52.2) 13.5(56.3) 13.0(55.4) 9.6(49.3) 5.4(41.7) 1.4(34.5) −1.6(29.1) 5.0(41.0) Record low °C (°F) −25.3(−13.5) −22.0(−7.6) −16.0(3.2) −7.4(18.7) −2.8(27.0) 1.3(34.3) 4.9(40.8) 4.6(40.3) −0.9(30.4) −7.7(18.1) −12.0(10.4) −24.0(−11.2) −25.3(−13.5) Average precipitation mm (inches) 37.2(1.46) 30.1(1.19) 39.3(1.55) 33.7(1.33) 52.6(2.07) 60.2(2.37) 52.5(2.07) 53.0(2.09) 39.5(1.56) 32.2(1.27) 37.8(1.49) 46.1(1.81) 515.2(20.28) Mean monthly sunshine hours 57.6 71.5 119.4 191.2 229.6 230.0 232.4 217.3 162.3 114.7 54.9 46.9 1,727.6 Average ultraviolet index 1 1 2 4 5 6 6 5 4 2 1 0 3 Source: DWD[79] and Weather Atlas[80] Climate data for Berlin (Tempelhof), elevation: 48 m or 157 ft, 1971–2000 normals, extremes 1878–present Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °C (°F) 15.5(59.9) 18.7(65.7) 24.8(76.6) 31.3(88.3) 35.5(95.9) 38.5(101.3) 38.1(100.6) 38.0(100.4) 34.2(93.6) 28.1(82.6) 20.5(68.9) 16.0(60.8) 38.5(101.3) Average high °C (°F) 3.3(37.9) 5.0(41.0) 9.0(48.2) 15.0(59.0) 19.6(67.3) 22.3(72.1) 25.0(77.0) 24.5(76.1) 19.3(66.7) 13.9(57.0) 7.7(45.9) 3.7(38.7) 14.0(57.2) Daily mean °C (°F) 0.6(33.1) 1.4(34.5) 4.8(40.6) 8.9(48.0) 14.3(57.7) 17.1(62.8) 19.2(66.6) 18.9(66.0) 14.5(58.1) 9.7(49.5) 4.7(40.5) 2.0(35.6) 9.7(49.4) Average low °C (°F) −1.9(28.6) −1.5(29.3) 1.3(34.3) 4.2(39.6) 9.0(48.2) 12.3(54.1) 14.3(57.7) 14.1(57.4) 10.6(51.1) 6.4(43.5) 2.2(36.0) −0.4(31.3) 5.9(42.6) Record low °C (°F) −23.1(−9.6) −26.0(−14.8) −16.5(2.3) −8.1(17.4) −4.0(24.8) 1.5(34.7) 6.1(43.0) 3.5(38.3) −1.5(29.3) −9.6(14.7) −16.0(3.2) −20.5(−4.9) −26.0(−14.8) Average precipitation mm (inches) 42.3(1.67) 33.3(1.31) 40.5(1.59) 37.1(1.46) 53.8(2.12) 68.7(2.70) 55.5(2.19) 58.2(2.29) 45.1(1.78) 37.3(1.47) 43.6(1.72) 55.3(2.18) 570.7(22.48) Average precipitation days (≥ 1.0 mm) 10.0 8.0 9.1 7.8 8.9 7.0 7.0 7.0 7.8 7.6 9.6 11.4 101.2 Source 1: WMO[81] Source 2: KNMI[82] Climate data for Berlin (Dahlem), 58 m or 190 ft, 1961–1990 normals, extremes 1908–present[note 2] Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °C (°F) 15.2(59.4) 18.6(65.5) 25.1(77.2) 30.9(87.6) 33.3(91.9) 36.1(97.0) 37.9(100.2) 37.7(99.9) 34.2(93.6) 27.5(81.5) 19.5(67.1) 15.7(60.3) 37.9(100.2) Average high °C (°F) 1.8(35.2) 3.5(38.3) 7.9(46.2) 13.1(55.6) 18.6(65.5) 21.8(71.2) 23.1(73.6) 22.8(73.0) 18.7(65.7) 13.3(55.9) 7.0(44.6) 3.2(37.8) 12.9(55.2) Daily mean °C (°F) −0.4(31.3) 0.6(33.1) 4.0(39.2) 8.4(47.1) 13.5(56.3) 16.7(62.1) 17.9(64.2) 17.2(63.0) 13.5(56.3) 9.3(48.7) 4.6(40.3) 1.2(34.2) 8.9(48.0) Average low °C (°F) −2.9(26.8) −2.2(28.0) 0.5(32.9) 3.9(39.0) 8.2(46.8) 11.4(52.5) 12.9(55.2) 12.4(54.3) 9.4(48.9) 5.9(42.6) 2.1(35.8) −1.1(30.0) 5.0(41.1) Record low °C (°F) −21.0(−5.8) −26.0(−14.8) −16.5(2.3) −6.7(19.9) −2.9(26.8) 0.8(33.4) 5.4(41.7) 4.7(40.5) −0.5(31.1) −9.6(14.7) −16.1(3.0) −20.2(−4.4) −26.0(−14.8) Average precipitation mm (inches) 43.0(1.69) 37.0(1.46) 38.0(1.50) 42.0(1.65) 55.0(2.17) 71.0(2.80) 53.0(2.09) 65.0(2.56) 46.0(1.81) 36.0(1.42) 50.0(1.97) 55.0(2.17) 591(23.29) Average precipitation days (≥ 1.0 mm) 10.0 9.0 8.0 9.0 10.0 10.0 9.0 9.0 9.0 8.0 10.0 11.0 112 Mean monthly sunshine hours 45.4 72.3 122.0 157.7 221.6 220.9 217.9 210.2 156.3 110.9 52.4 37.4 1,625 Source 1: NOAA[84] Source 2: Berliner Extremwerte[85] Cityscape[edit] Aerial photo over central Berlin showing City West, Potsdamer Platz, Alexanderplatz and the Tiergarten Berlin's history has left the city with a polycentric organization and a highly eclectic array of architecture and buildings. The city's appearance today has been predominantly shaped by the key role it played in Germany's history during the 20th century. All of the national governments based in Berlin – the Kingdom of Prussia, the 2nd German Empire of 1871, the Weimar Republic, Nazi Germany, East Germany, as well as the reunified Germany – initiated ambitious reconstruction programs, with each adding its own distinctive style to the city's architecture. Berlin was devastated by air raids, fires, and street battles during the Second World War, and many of the buildings that had survived in both East and West were demolished during the postwar period. Much of this demolition was initiated by municipal architecture programs to build new business or residential districts and the main arteries. Much ornamentation on prewar buildings was destroyed following modernist dogmas, and in both postwar systems, as well as in the reunified Berlin, many important heritage structures have been reconstructed, including the Forum Fridericianum along with, the State Opera (1955), Charlottenburg Palace (1957), the monumental buildings on Gendarmenmarkt (1980s), Kommandantur (2003) and also the project to reconstruct the baroque façades of the City Palace. Many new buildings have been inspired by their historical predecessors or the general classical style of Berlin, such as Hotel Adlon. Clusters of towers rise at various locations: Potsdamer Platz, the City West, and Alexanderplatz, the latter two delineating the former centers of East and West Berlin, with the first representing a new Berlin of the 21st century, risen from the wastes of no-man's land of the Berlin Wall. Berlin has five of the top 50 tallest buildings in Germany. Over one-third of the city area consists of green space, woodlands, and water.[11] Berlin's second-largest and most popular park, the Großer Tiergarten, is located right in the center of the city. It covers an area of 210 hectares and stretches from Bahnhof Zoo in the City West to the Brandenburg Gate in the east. Among famous streets, Unter den Linden and Friedrichstraße are found in the city's old city centre (and were included in the former East Berlin). Some of the major streets in City West are Kurfürstendamm (or just Ku´damm) and Kantstraße. Architecture[edit] Main article: Architecture of Berlin Further information: List of sights in Berlin and List of tallest buildings in Berlin View of Gendarmenmarkt, with the Konzerthaus Berlin to the right and the German Church in the back The Berlin Cathedral at Museum Island The Fernsehturm (TV tower) at Alexanderplatz in Mitte is among the tallest structures in the European Union at 368 m (1,207 ft). Built in 1969, it is visible throughout most of the central districts of Berlin. The city can be viewed from its 204-meter-high (669 ft) observation floor. Starting here, the Karl-Marx-Allee heads east, an avenue lined by monumental residential buildings, designed in the Socialist Classicism style. Adjacent to this area is the Rotes Rathaus (City Hall), with its distinctive red-brick architecture. In front of it is the Neptunbrunnen, a fountain featuring a mythological group of Tritons, personifications of the four main Prussian rivers, and Neptune on top of it. The Brandenburg Gate is an iconic landmark of Berlin and Germany; it stands as a symbol of eventful European history and of unity and peace. The Reichstag building is the traditional seat of the German Parliament. It was remodeled by British architect Norman Foster in the 1990s and features a glass dome over the session area, which allows free public access to the parliamentary proceedings and magnificent views of the city. The East Side Gallery is an open-air exhibition of art painted directly on the last existing portions of the Berlin Wall. It is the largest remaining evidence of the city's historical division. The Gendarmenmarkt is a neoclassical square in Berlin, the name of which derives from the headquarters of the famous Gens d'armes regiment located here in the 18th century. Two similarly designed cathedrals border it, the Französischer Dom with its observation platform and the Deutscher Dom. The Konzerthaus (Concert Hall), home of the Berlin Symphony Orchestra, stands between the two cathedrals. Charlottenburg Palace Hackesche Höfe The Museum Island in the River Spree houses five museums built from 1830 to 1930 and is a UNESCO World Heritage site. Restoration and construction of a main entrance to all museums, as well as reconstruction of the Stadtschloss continues.[86][87] Also on the island and next to the Lustgarten and palace is Berlin Cathedral, emperor William II's ambitious attempt to create a Protestant counterpart to St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. A large crypt houses the remains of some of the earlier Prussian royal family. St. Hedwig's Cathedral is Berlin's Roman Catholic cathedral. Breitscheidplatz with Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church is the center of City West. Unter den Linden is a tree-lined east–west avenue from the Brandenburg Gate to the site of the former Berliner Stadtschloss, and was once Berlin's premier promenade. Many Classical buildings line the street, and part of Humboldt University is there. Friedrichstraße was Berlin's legendary street during the Golden Twenties. It combines 20th-century traditions with the modern architecture of today's Berlin. Potsdamer Platz is an entire quarter built from scratch after the Wall came down.[88] To the west of Potsdamer Platz is the Kulturforum, which houses the Gemäldegalerie, and is flanked by the Neue Nationalgalerie and the Berliner Philharmonie. The Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, a Holocaust memorial, is to the north.[89] The area around Hackescher Markt is home to fashionable culture, with countless clothing outlets, clubs, bars, and galleries. This includes the Hackesche Höfe, a conglomeration of buildings around several courtyards, reconstructed around 1996. The nearby New Synagogue is the center of Jewish culture. The Straße des 17. Juni, connecting the Brandenburg Gate and Ernst-Reuter-Platz, serves as the central east–west axis. Its name commemorates the uprisings in East Berlin of 17 June 1953. Approximately halfway from the Brandenburg Gate is the Großer Stern, a circular traffic island on which the Siegessäule (Victory Column) is situated. This monument, built to commemorate Prussia's victories, was relocated in 1938–39 from its previous position in front of the Reichstag. The Kurfürstendamm is home to some of Berlin's luxurious stores with the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church at its eastern end on Breitscheidplatz. The church was destroyed in the Second World War and left in ruins. Nearby on Tauentzienstraße is KaDeWe, claimed to be continental Europe's largest department store. The Rathaus Schöneberg, where John F. Kennedy made his famous ""Ich bin ein Berliner!"" speech, is in Tempelhof-Schöneberg. West of the center, Bellevue Palace is the residence of the German President. Charlottenburg Palace, which was burnt out in the Second World War, is the largest historical palace in Berlin. The Funkturm Berlin is a 150-meter-tall (490 ft) lattice radio tower in the fairground area, built between 1924 and 1926. It is the only observation tower which stands on insulators and has a restaurant 55 m (180 ft) and an observation deck 126 m (413 ft) above ground, which is reachable by a windowed elevator. The Oberbaumbrücke over the Spree river is Berlin's most iconic bridge, connecting the now-combined boroughs of Friedrichshain and Kreuzberg. It carries vehicles, pedestrians, and the U1 Berlin U-Bahn line. The bridge was completed in a brick gothic style in 1896, replacing the former wooden bridge with an upper deck for the U-Bahn. The center portion was demolished in 1945 to stop the Red Army from crossing. After the war, the repaired bridge served as a checkpoint and border crossing between the Soviet and American sectors, and later between East and West Berlin. In the mid-1950s, it was closed to vehicles, and after the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, pedestrian traffic was heavily restricted. Following German reunification, the center portion was reconstructed with a steel frame, and U-Bahn service resumed in 1995. Demographics[edit] Main article: Demographics of Berlin Berlin's population, 1880–2012 At the end of 2018, the city-state of Berlin had 3.75 million registered inhabitants[2] in an area of 891.1 km2 (344.1 sq mi).[1] The city's population density was 4,206 inhabitants per km2. Berlin is the most populous city proper in the European Union.

In 2014 the German capital registered a migration surplus of approximately 40,000 people.[92] Nationalities[edit] Residents by Citizenship (31 December 2019)[2] Country Population Total registered residents 3,769,495 Germany 2,992,150 Turkey 98,940 Poland 56,573 Syria 39,813 Italy 31,573 Bulgaria 30,824 Russia 26,640 Romania 24,264 United States 22,694 Vietnam 20,572 France 20,223 Serbia 20,109 United Kingdom 16,751 Spain 15,045 Greece 14,625 Croatia 14,430 India 13,450 Ukraine 13,410 Afghanistan 13,301 China 13,293 Bosnia and Herzegovina 12,691 Other Middle East and Asia 88,241 Other Europe 80,807 Africa 36,414 Other Americas 27,491 Oceania and Antarctica 5,651 Stateless or Unclear 24,184 National and international migration into the city has a long history. In 1685, after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in France, the city responded with the Edict of Potsdam, which guaranteed religious freedom and tax-free status to French Huguenot refugees for ten years. The Greater Berlin Act in 1920 incorporated many suburbs and surrounding cities of Berlin. It formed most of the territory that comprises modern Berlin and increased the population from 1.9 million to 4 million. Active immigration and asylum politics in West Berlin triggered waves of immigration in the 1960s and 1970s. Berlin is home to at least 180,000 Turkish and Turkish German residents,[2] making it the largest Turkish community outside of Turkey. In the 1990s the Aussiedlergesetze enabled immigration to Germany of some residents from the former Soviet Union. Today ethnic Germans from countries of the former Soviet Union make up the largest portion of the Russian-speaking community.[93] The last decade experienced an influx from various Western countries and some African regions.[94] A portion of the African immigrants have settled in the Afrikanisches Viertel.[95] Young Germans, EU-Europeans and Israelis have also settled in the city.[96] In December 2019, there were 777,345 registered residents of foreign nationality and another 542,975 German citizens with a ""migration background"" (Migrationshintergrund, MH),[2] meaning they or one of their parents immigrated to Germany after 1955. Foreign residents of Berlin originate from about 190 different countries.[97] 48 percent of the residents under the age of 15 have migration background.[98] Berlin in 2009 was estimated to have 100,000 to 250,000 unregistered inhabitants.[99] Boroughs of Berlin with a significant number of migrants or foreign born population are Mitte, Neukölln and Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg.[100] There are more than 20 non-indigenous communities with a population of at least 10,000 people, including Turkish, Polish, Russian, Lebanese, Palestinian, Serbian, Italian, Bosnian, Vietnamese, American, Romanian, Bulgarian, Croatian, Chinese, Austrian, Ukrainian, French, British, Spanish, Israeli, Thai, Iranian, Egyptian and Syrian communities.[citation needed] Languages[edit] Main articles: German language and Berlinerisch dialect German is the official and predominant spoken language in Berlin. It is a West Germanic language that derives most of its vocabulary from the Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family. German is one of 24 languages of the European Union,[101] and one of the three working languages of the European Commission. Berlinerisch or Berlinisch is not a dialect linguistically. It is spoken in Berlin and the surrounding metropolitan area. It originates from a Brandenburgish variant. The dialect is now seen more like a sociolect, largely through increased immigration and trends among the educated population to speak standard German in everyday life. The most commonly spoken foreign languages in Berlin are Turkish, Polish, English, Arabic, Italian, Bulgarian, Russian, Romanian, Kurdish, Serbo-Croatian, French, Spanish and Vietnamese. Turkish, Arabic, Kurdish, and Serbo-Croatian are heard more often in the western part due to the large Middle Eastern and former-Yugoslavian communities. Polish, English, Russian, and Vietnamese have more native speakers in East Berlin.[102] Religion[edit] Main article: Religion in Berlin Clockwise from top left: Berlin Cathedral, New Synagogue, Şehitlik Mosque, and St. Hedwig's Cathedral According to the 2011 census, approximately 37 percent of the population reported being members of a legally-recognized church or religious organization. The rest either did not belong to such an organization, or there was no information available about them.[103] The largest religious denomination recorded in 2010 was the Protestant regional church body—the Evangelical Church of Berlin-Brandenburg-Silesian Upper Lusatia (EKBO)—a united church. EKBO is a member of the Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD) and Union Evangelischer Kirchen (UEK). According to the EKBO, their membership accounted for 18.7 percent of the local population, while the Roman Catholic Church had 9.1 percent of residents registered as its members.[104] About 2.7% of the population identify with other Christian denominations (mostly Eastern Orthodox, but also various Protestants).[105] According to the Berlin residents register, in 2018 14.9 percent were members of the Evangelical Church, and 8.5 percent were members of the Catholic Church.[2] The government keeps a register of members of these churches for tax purposes, because it collects church tax on behalf of the churches. It does not keep records of members of other religious organizations which may collect their own church tax, in this way. In 2009, approximately 249,000 Muslims were reported by the Office of Statistics to be members of Mosques and Islamic religious organizations in Berlin,[106] while in 2016, the newspaper Der Tagesspiegel estimated that about 350,000 Muslims observed Ramadan in Berlin.[107] In 2019, about 437,000 registered residents, 11.6% of the total, reported having a migration background from one of the Member states of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.[2][108] Between 1992 and 2011 the Muslim population almost doubled.[109] About 0.9% of Berliners belong to other religions. Of the estimated population of 30,000–45,000 Jewish residents,[110] approximately 12,000 are registered members of religious organizations.[105] Berlin is the seat of the Roman Catholic archbishop of Berlin and EKBO's elected chairperson is titled the bishop of EKBO. Furthermore, Berlin is the seat of many Orthodox cathedrals, such as the Cathedral of St. Boris the Baptist, one of the two seats of the Bulgarian Orthodox Diocese of Western and Central Europe, and the Resurrection of Christ Cathedral of the Diocese of Berlin (Patriarchate of Moscow). The faithful of the different religions and denominations maintain many places of worship in Berlin. The Independent Evangelical Lutheran Church has eight parishes of different sizes in Berlin.[111] There are 36 Baptist congregations (within Union of Evangelical Free Church Congregations in Germany), 29 New Apostolic Churches, 15 United Methodist churches, eight Free Evangelical Congregations, four Churches of Christ, Scientist (1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 11th), six congregations of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, an Old Catholic church, and an Anglican church in Berlin. Berlin has more than 80 mosques,[112] ten synagogues,[113] and two Buddhist temples. Government[edit] Main articles: Politics of Berlin and Berlin Police City state[edit] Rotes Rathaus (Red City Hall), seat of the Senate and Mayor of Berlin Since reunification on 3 October 1990, Berlin has been one of the three city states in Germany among the present 16 states of Germany. The House of Representatives (Abgeordnetenhaus) functions as the city and state parliament, which has 141 seats. Berlin's executive body is the Senate of Berlin (Senat von Berlin). The Senate consists of the Governing Mayor (Regierender Bürgermeister), and up to ten senators holding ministerial positions, two of them holding the title of ""Mayor"" (Bürgermeister) as deputy to the Governing Mayor.[114] The total annual state budget of Berlin in 2015 exceeded €24.5 ($30.0) billion including a budget surplus of €205 ($240) million.[115] The state owns extensive assets, including administrative and government buildings, real estate companies, as well as stakes in the Olympic Stadium, swimming pools, housing companies, and numerous public enterprises and subsidiary companies.[116][117] The Social Democratic Party (SPD) and The Left (Die Linke) took control of the city government after the 2001 state election and won another term in the 2006 state election.[118] Since the 2016 state election, there has been a coalition between the Social Democratic Party, the Greens and the Left Party. The Governing Mayor is simultaneously Lord Mayor of the City of Berlin (Oberbürgermeister der Stadt) and Minister President of the State of Berlin (Ministerpräsident des Bundeslandes). The office of the Governing Mayor is in the Rotes Rathaus (Red City Hall). Since 2014 this office has been held by Michael Müller of the Social Democrats.[119] Boroughs[edit] Main article: Boroughs and neighborhoods of Berlin Berlin's 12 boroughs and their 96 neighborhoods Kreuzberg Foto: Erik Lindner Berlin is subdivided into 12 boroughs or districts (Bezirke). Each borough has several subdistricts or neighborhoods (Ortsteile), which have roots in much older municipalities that predate the formation of Greater Berlin on 1 October 1920. These subdistricts became urbanized and incorporated into the city later on. Many residents strongly identify with their neighborhoods, colloquially called Kiez. At present, Berlin consists of 96 subdistricts, which are commonly made up of several smaller residential areas or quarters. Each borough is governed by a borough council (Bezirksamt) consisting of five councilors (Bezirksstadträte) including the borough's mayor (Bezirksbürgermeister). The council is elected by the borough assembly (Bezirksverordnetenversammlung). However, the individual boroughs are not independent municipalities, but subordinate to the Senate of Berlin. The borough's mayors make up the council of mayors (Rat der Bürgermeister), which is led by the city's Governing Mayor and advises the Senate. The neighborhoods have no local government bodies. Twin towns – sister cities[edit] See also: List of twin towns and sister cities in Germany Berlin maintains official partnerships with 17 cities.[120] Town twinning between Berlin and other cities began with its sister city Los Angeles in 1967. East Berlin's partnerships were canceled at the time of German reunification but later partially reestablished. West Berlin's partnerships had previously been restricted to the borough level. During the Cold War era, the partnerships had reflected the different power blocs, with West Berlin partnering with capitals in the Western World and East Berlin mostly partnering with cities from the Warsaw Pact and its allies. There are several joint projects with many other cities, such as Beirut, Belgrade, São Paulo, Copenhagen, Helsinki, Amsterdam, Johannesburg, Mumbai, Oslo, Hanoi, Shanghai, Seoul, Sofia, Sydney, New York City and Vienna. Berlin participates in international city associations such as the Union of the Capitals of the European Union, Eurocities, Network of European Cities of Culture, Metropolis, Summit Conference of the World's Major Cities, and Conference of the World's Capital Cities. Berlin is twinned with:[120] Los Angeles, United States (1967) Madrid, Spain (1988) Istanbul, Turkey (1989) Warsaw, Poland (1991) Moscow, Russia (1991) Brussels, Belgium (1992) Budapest, Hungary (1992) Tashkent, Uzbekistan (1993) Mexico City, Mexico (1993) Jakarta, Indonesia (1993) Beijing, China (1994) Tokyo, Japan (1994) Buenos Aires, Argentina (1994) Prague, Czech Republic (1995) Windhoek, Namibia (2000) London, England (2000) Since 1987, Berlin also has an official partnership with Paris, France. Every Berlin borough also established its own twin towns. For example, the borough of Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg has a partnership with the Israeli city of Kiryat Yam.[121] Capital city[edit] Berlin is the capital of the Federal Republic of Germany. The President of Germany, whose functions are mainly ceremonial under the German constitution, has their official residence in Bellevue Palace.[122] Berlin is the seat of the German Chancellor (Prime Minister), housed in the Chancellery building, the Bundeskanzleramt. Facing the Chancellery is the Bundestag, the German Parliament, housed in the renovated Reichstag building since the government's relocation to Berlin in 1998. The Bundesrat (""federal council"", performing the function of an upper house) is the representation of the 16 constituent states (Länder) of Germany and has its seat at the former Prussian House of Lords. The total annual federal budget managed by the German government exceeded €310 ($375) billion in 2013.[123] The Federal Chancellery building, seat of the Chancellor of Germany The Reichstag, seat of the Bundestag Schloss Bellevue, seat of the President of Germany Prussian House of Lords, the seat of the Bundesrat of Germany Headquarters of the Federal Intelligence Service The relocation of the federal government and Bundestag to Berlin was mostly completed in 1999. However, some ministries, as well as some minor departments, stayed in the federal city Bonn, the former capital of West Germany. Discussions about moving the remaining ministries and departments to Berlin continue.[124] The Federal Foreign Office and the ministries and departments of Defense, Justice and Consumer Protection, Finance, Interior, Economic Affairs and Energy, Labor and Social Affairs, Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth, Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, Food and Agriculture, Economic Cooperation and Development, Health, Transport and Digital Infrastructure and Education and Research are based in the capital. Berlin hosts in total 158 foreign embassies[125] as well as the headquarters of many think tanks, trade unions, nonprofit organizations, lobbying groups, and professional associations. Due to the influence and international partnerships of the Federal Republic of Germany, the capital city has become a significant center of German and European affairs. Frequent official visits and diplomatic consultations among governmental representatives and national leaders are common in contemporary Berlin.

Rail[edit] Berlin Hauptbahnhof is the largest grade-separated railway station in Europe. Long-distance rail lines connect Berlin with all of the major cities of Germany and with many cities in neighboring European countries. Regional rail lines of the Verkehrsverbund Berlin-Brandenburg provide access to the surrounding regions of Brandenburg and to the Baltic Sea. The Berlin Hauptbahnhof is the largest grade-separated railway station in Europe.[159] Deutsche Bahn runs high speed Intercity-Express trains to domestic destinations like Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Stuttgart, Frankfurt am Main and others. It also runs an airport express rail service, as well as trains to several international destinations like Vienna, Prague, Zürich, Warsaw, Wrocław, Budapest and Amsterdam.

The city has more than 10 stations[160] that run buses to destinations throughout Germany and Europe, being Zentraler Omnibusbahnhof Berlin the biggest station. Public transport[edit] The Berlin U-Bahn (Metro) at Heidelberger Platz station The Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe (BVG) and the Deutsche Bahn (DB) manage several extensive urban public transport systems.[161] System Stations / Lines / Net length Annual ridership Operator / Notes S-Bahn 166 / 16 / 331 km (206 mi) 431,000,000 (2016) DB / Mainly overground rapid transit rail system with suburban stops U-Bahn 173 / 10 / 146 km (91 mi) 563,000,000 (2017) BVG / Mainly underground rail system / 24h-service on weekends Tram 404 / 22 / 194 km (121 mi) 197,000,000 (2017) BVG / Operates predominantly in eastern boroughs Bus 3227 / 198 / 1,675 km (1,041 mi) 440,000,000 (2017) BVG / Extensive services in all boroughs / 62 Night Lines Ferry 6 lines BVG / Transportation as well as recreational ferries Travelers can access all modes of transport with a single ticket. Public transportation in Berlin has a long and complicated history because of the 20th-century division of the city, where movement between the two halves was not served. Since 1989, the transport network has been developed extensively; however, it still contains early 20th century traits, such as the U1.[162] Airports[edit] Flights departing from Berlin serve 163 destinations around the globe. Airports in Berlin, including those that are no longer used (as of November 2020) Berlin is served by one commercial international airport: Berlin Brandenburg Airport (BER), located just outside Berlin's south-eastern border, in the state of Brandenburg. It began construction in 2006, with the intention of replacing Tegel Airport (TXL) and Schönefeld Airport (SXF) as the single commercial airport of Berlin.[163] Previously set to open in 2012, after extensive delays and cost overruns, it opened for commercial operations in October 2020.[164] The planned initial capacity of around 27 million passengers per year[165] is to be further developed to bring the terminal capacity to approximately 55 million per year by 2040.[166] Before the opening of the BER in Brandenburg, Berlin was served by Tegel Airport and Schönefeld Airport. Tegel Airport was within the city limits, and Schönefeld Airport was located at the same site as the BER. Both airports together handled 29.5 million passengers in 2015. In 2014, 67 airlines served 163 destinations in 50 countries from Berlin.[167] Tegel Airport was a focus city for Lufthansa and Eurowings while Schönefeld served as an important destination for airlines like Germania, easyJet and Ryanair. Until 2008, Berlin was also served by the smaller Tempelhof Airport, which functioned as a city airport, with a convenient location near the city center, allowing for quick transit times between the central business district and the airport. The airport grounds have since been turned into a city park. Cycling[edit] Main article: Cycling in Berlin Berlin is well known for its highly developed bicycle lane system.[168] It is estimated Berlin has 710 bicycles per 1000 residents. Around 500,000 daily bike riders accounted for 13% of total traffic in 2010.[169] Cyclists have access to 620 km (385 mi) of bicycle paths including approximately 150 km (93 mi) of mandatory bicycle paths, 190 km (118 mi) of off-road bicycle routes, 60 km (37 mi) of bicycle lanes on roads, 70 km (43 mi) of shared bus lanes which are also open to cyclists, 100 km (62 mi) of combined pedestrian/bike paths and 50 km (31 mi) of marked bicycle lanes on roadside pavements (or sidewalks).[170] Riders are allowed to carry their bicycles on Regionalbahn, S-Bahn and U-Bahn trains, on trams, and on night buses if a bike ticket is purchased.[171] Rohrpost (pneumatic postal network)[edit] Main article: Rohrpost in Berlin From 1865 until 1976, Berlin had an extensive pneumatic postal network, which at its peak in 1940, totaled 400 kilometers in length. After 1949 the system was split into two separated networks. The West Berlin system in operation and open for public use until 1963, and for government use until 1972. The East Berlin system which inherited the Hauptelegraphenamt, the central hub of the system, was in operation until 1976 Energy[edit] Heizkraftwerk Mitte power plant Berlin's two largest energy provider for private households are the Swedish firm Vattenfall and the Berlin-based company GASAG. Both offer electric power and natural gas supply. Some of the city's electric energy is imported from nearby power plants in southern Brandenburg.[172] As of 2015[update] the five largest power plants measured by capacity are the Heizkraftwerk Reuter West, the Heizkraftwerk Lichterfelde, the Heizkraftwerk Mitte, the Heizkraftwerk Wilmersdorf, and the Heizkraftwerk Charlottenburg. All of these power stations generate electricity and useful heat at the same time to facilitate buffering during load peaks. In 1993 the power grid connections in the Berlin-Brandenburg capital region were renewed. In most of the inner districts of Berlin power lines are underground cables; only a 380 kV and a 110 kV line, which run from Reuter substation to the urban Autobahn, use overhead lines. The Berlin 380-kV electric line is the backbone of the city's energy grid. Health[edit] The Charité university hospital Berlin has a long history of discoveries in medicine and innovations in medical technology.[173] The modern history of medicine has been significantly influenced by scientists from Berlin. Rudolf Virchow was the founder of cellular pathology, while Robert Koch developed vaccines for anthrax, cholera, and tuberculosis.[174] The Charité complex (Universitätsklinik Charité) is the largest university hospital in Europe, tracing back its origins to the year 1710. More than half of all German Nobel Prize winners in Physiology or Medicine, including Emil von Behring, Robert Koch and Paul Ehrlich, have worked at the Charité. The Charité is spread over four campuses and comprises around 3,000 beds, 15,500 staff, 8,000 students, and more than 60 operating theaters, and it has a turnover of two billion euros annually.[175] The Charité is a joint institution of the Freie Universität Berlin and the Humboldt University of Berlin, including a wide range of institutes and specialized medical centers. Among them are the German Heart Center, one of the most renowned transplantation centers, the Max-Delbrück-Center for Molecular Medicine, and the Max-Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics. The scientific research at these institutions is complemented by many research departments of companies such as Siemens and Bayer. The World Health Summit and several international health-related conventions are held annually in Berlin.

Subsequently, the Altes Museum was built in the Lustgarten. The Neues Museum, which displays the bust of Queen Nefertiti,[199] Alte Nationalgalerie, Pergamon Museum, and Bode Museum were built there. Apart from the Museum Island, there are many additional museums in the city.

The Beate Uhse Erotic Museum claims to be the world's largest erotic museum.[203] The cityscape of Berlin displays large quantities of urban street art.[204] It has become a significant part of the city's cultural heritage and has its roots in the graffiti scene of Kreuzberg of the 1980s.[205] The Berlin Wall itself has become one of the largest open-air canvasses in the world.[206] The leftover stretch along the Spree river in Friedrichshain remains as the East Side Gallery. Berlin today is consistently rated as an important world city for street art culture.[207] Berlin has galleries which are quite rich in contemporary art.

The SOUND and the Dschungel gained notoriety. Throughout the 1990s, people in their 20s from all over the world, particularly those in Western and Central Europe, made Berlin's club scene a premier nightlife venue. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, many historic buildings in Mitte, the former city center of East Berlin, were illegally occupied and re-built by young squatters and became a fertile ground for underground and counterculture gatherings.[209] The central boroughs are home to many nightclubs, including the Watergate, Tresor and Berghain. The KitKatClub and several other locations are known for their sexually uninhibited parties. Clubs are not required to close at a fixed time during the weekends, and many parties last well into the morning or even all weekend. The Weekend Club near Alexanderplatz features a roof terrace that allows partying at night. Several venues have become a popular stage for the Neo-Burlesque scene. The French Cathedral during the annual Festival of Lights Hanukkah festival at the Brandenburg Gate Berlin has a long history of gay culture, and is an important birthplace of the LGBT rights movement. Same-sex bars and dance halls operated freely as early as the 1880s, and the first gay magazine, Der Eigene, started in 1896. By the 1920s, gays and lesbians had an unprecedented visibility.[210][211] Today, in addition to a positive atmosphere in the wider club scene, the city again has a huge number of queer clubs and festivals. The most famous and largest are Berlin Pride, the Christopher Street Day,[212] the Lesbian and Gay City Festival in Berlin-Schöneberg, the Kreuzberg Pride and Hustlaball.

Most of today's social overhead capital (SOC) infrastructures are concrete structures. Concrete structures deteriorate due to a range of factors, and their structural safety degrades due to excessive loads. But up to now, the safety management and maintenance of concrete structures has mainly depended on visual inspection by manpower, and thus remains at a subjective and qualitative level. Accordingly, there are problems in terms of reliability, real-time status identification, and response to safety assessment results. To solve this problem, in this study, we developed embedded distributed fiber optic sensors for concrete structures (Nerve Sensors in Concrete Structures), which have excellent durability and reliability and address the problems of existing point-type sensors, and installed them in concrete structures, enabling them to measure the strain of concrete structures in many locations in a manner similar to the human body's nerves. Through their application, we developed a technology that enables the smart safety management of concrete structures. Development of Nerve Sensor The nerve sensors in concrete structures developed in this study are based on optical fibers with excellent durability and reliability. As optical fiber is vulnerable to damage, it is difficult to embed it in a concrete structure. For this reason, we devised a method to protect the optical fiber by embedding it in a circular FRP (Fiber Reinforced Polymer) rod, and developed a manufacturing technology to produce it efficiently. To this end, the use of pultrusion and braidtrusion were reviewed, and manufacturing technology that employs pultrusion was adopted in consideration of quality control. For nerve sensors to properly grasp the behavior of concrete members, integrity with the concrete must be secured. To accomplish this, the study was conducted on the surface shape of nerve sensor and surface treatment technology. To connect the nerve sensors to the measuring instrument after embedding them in the concrete structure, the optical fiber must be removed from the FRP rod. Since the FRP rod is made of thermosetting resin, it is not easy to abstract the optical fiber. Therefore, it is necessary to develop technology for this. In this study, heat abstraction, mechanical abstraction, and chemical abstraction were studied and reviewed, and an optimal technology for easy optical fiber abstraction was developed. To measure the strain of the structure at many locations with nerve sensors, optical fiber-based distributed measurement technology is needed. The distributed measurement technology developed thus far is not suitable for monitoring concrete structures in terms of the measurement interval, measurement accuracy, measurement time, etc. In this study, a distributed measuring instrument that solves these problems was developed in collaboration with specialist organizations, and its performance was verified through a number of experiments. However, the developed distributed measuring instrument has a problem in that dynamic measurement is not easy. To solve this problem, a semi-distributed dynamic measuring instrument was also studied, and the applicability was confirmed through various verifications of the developed prototype (Figure 2). Development of Nerve Sensor Utilization Technology Since the purpose of developing the nerve sensor is to directly measure the strain occurring in the concrete member, it is essential to ensure the reliability of the measurement in order to secure an integrated behavior between the concrete and the nerve sensor. In other words, between the surface of the FRP rod constituting the nerve sensor and the concrete surrounding it, it is necessary to secure an adhesive force that is greater than the required performance to ensure the reliability of the measurement. In this study, various surface treatments were examined for this purpose, and suitable surface treatment methods were derived through adhesion experiments. By comparing the value measured by the nerve sensor after installing the developed nerve sensor in the concrete member with the value measured by the existing verified sensor (electrical resistance strain sensor, FBG-based fiber optic sensor), it was confirmed that the nerve sensor has sufficient accuracy for structure monitoring. The values were obtained during the loading test. The method of installing the nerve sensors in new structures and in existing structures is different. In a new structure, the nerve sensor is installed along the rebar, so it can be placed relatively easily. But in an existing structure, a groove must be created on the concrete surface and the nerve sensor embedded using adhesive (Figure 3). Since the nerve sensor uses optical fiber, it has the advantage of remotely acquiring data using an existing optical (photonic) network. In other words, it is possible to connect the nerve sensors embedded in multiple structures to the optical network, and measure each nerve sensor using the optical instrument at the base station or the integrated control office. In this way, the safety of multiple structures can be efficiently managed (Figure 4). Development of Smart Monitoring Technology Based on Digital Twin Digital twin technology was used to detect, evaluate, and predict damage to structures using data collected from nerve sensors installed in structures. A digital twin is a computer model (digital model) of an existing structure. By reflecting the sensor data in the digital twin, it is possible to understand or predict the current condition of the real structure by computer-simulating situations that may occur in the real structure. As a result, the conditions and safety of the structure can be efficiently managed (Figure 5). To assess the performance of a structure after it has been built using a digital twin, a finite element analysis program is needed. The existing programs in this area that are commercially available cannot implement nerve sensors. They also have high prices and license issues. For this reason, we developed our own analysis engine in this study. When a digital twin is built using acceleration data, changes in the overall behavior of the structure can be detected, but localized damage is difficult to detect. However, if a digital twin is built using the strain data of the nerve sensors, it has the advantage not only of detecting the overall behavior change but also of detecting important local damage in terms of maintenance. In this study, a strain-based model updating technology was developed to reflect the characteristics of the nerve sensors, and an integrated digital twin system was developed to assess the damage and performance of the structure by linking it with its own analysis engine (Figure 6). The applicability of the developed technology was verified by comparing the results of the integrated digital twin system that does not require a load test with the results of the existing method to assess the performance of a structure through an in-situ load test for an actual bridge to which the nerve sensors are applied. Conclusion In this study, a measuring instrument related to a fiber optic-based nerve sensor was developed to scientifically and efficiently manage the condition of concrete structures, and its performance was verified through various experiments. To assess the safety and damage of structures, a digital twin technique using nerve sensor data was developed, and its potential was verified through its application to the field.

We had no where to begin. Scouring the web at all hours of the night wasn't gonna cut it. RocketReach has given us a great place to start. Our workflow has solid direction now - we have a process in place the begins with RocketReach and ends with huge contact lists for our sales team..it probably saves Feedtrail about 3 months of work in terms of lead gathering. We can divert our attention to actually going after the customer now! - Chris , CoFounder @ Feedtrail Great for building a list of leads. I loved the ability to determine personal emails from virtually anyone on the web with RocketReach. I was assigned a project recently that regarded public relations, partnership, and outreach responsibilities and RocketReach not only connected me to prospective individuals but allowed me to streamline my search approach on the basis of location, skill set, and keyword. - Brian Ray , Sales Manager @ Google Prior to RocketReach, we would reach out to people through professional networking sites like Linkedln. But it was frustrating for us to have to wait for people to accept our connection requests (if they accepted them at all) and sending is too expensive..this was a major speed bump in our workflow and source of never ending frustration.. With the shear number of contacts we've been able to find using RocketReach, the platform has probably saved us nearly five years' worth of waiting. - Nathan Choi , Founder & CEO @ Nathan Research Group Inc It's the best, most effective email search engine I've used yet, and I've tried a few. Both in the scope of the searches, and in the number of accurate emails found, I find it surpasses others. I also like the layout, which is easy on the eye, more attractive and efficient. The bottom line is that it has been a effective tool in my work, as a non-profit reaching out to leadership. - HeathCliff Rothman Before RocketReach, the process of sourcing email addresses consisted of scouring the internet, asking mutual friends, or stalking on LinkedIn. The most frustrating part was how time consuming this all was.The first time I used RocketReach was when I realized I made the right decision. Finding emails for contacts turned into a one-and-done instead of a week long process. - Tori Loiacono Looking up emails for a targeted outreach was manual and enormously time consuming. When I tried RocketReach and to find business information about key people in seconds in an easy and seamless process, I was hooked! The tool reduced the time to connect with new prospects by close to 90%. - Niklas Anzingeri , Strategic Initiatives Leader @ Dalia Research MARKETING Power up your marketing and get people to pay attention to your business, pursuit, or clients.

271,"Korea - KBCSD - SDG Business Hub Home SDGs at WBCSD News & Insights Resources Webinars & briefing notes Select Page Korea – KBCSD What is your country’s government doing with respect to the SDGs and how have they engaged business around this agenda? The Korean Ministry of Environment along with the Committee on Sustainable Development serves as a control tower in establishing the Korean-tailored SDGs, namely the K-SDGs. 17 task-forces representing each SDG, involving government officials, private sector experts and academia, are responsible for drafting the K-SDGs framework which will include goals, targets and implementation tasks. Additionally, 13 multi-stakeholder groups have been set up to provide their inputs through position papers. The K-SDGs framework is scheduled to be finalized at the end of 2018. The business sector is engaged in drafting the K-SDGs framework, either by serving as a member of the 17 task-forces or by representing their voices as one of the 13 multi-stakeholder groups. What are some of the key trends with regard to how business is engaging with the SDGs in your country? Mostly large companies with domestic and international business operations are focused on mainstreaming the SDGs into their management practices as they are more exposed to UN mandate. Overall, business engagement with the SDGs in Korea can be summed up into two-types: Aligning their core business and/or core technology with the SDGs by integrating local communities, consumers, subcontractors and developing countries in the corporate value chain; Establishing the company-specific SDG goals, targets, index and measurement tools to be implemented and monitored by a designated time period (approx. 3-5 years). What is your organization doing with respect to the SDGs? The Korea Business Council for Sustainable Development (KBCSD), which has been designated as the Focal Point of the K-SDG’s Business Sector Group, is responsible for advocating the business voice and perspective in respect to developing the K-SDGs framework by communicating closely with about 200 Korean companies, government ministries and other stakeholder groups. Meanwhile, KBCSD is partnering with the Ministry of Environment and the Committee on Sustainable Development in setting up the ‘Innovative Technology Platform for Implementing the SDGs’ to be launched in the latter half of 2018. The Platform aims at identifying best practice for accelerating the SDG implementation through innovative and appropriate technologies in areas such as plastic alternatives, manufacturing processes, transportation, energy transformation and smart cities.

The organizational score represents the degree to which the organization influencing climate policy and legislation. Corporations also have relationship scores reflecting their links with influencers like trade associations. Both are combined to place the corporation in a performance band. Full details can be found here. close D+ Performance Band 50% Organisation Score 0% Engagement Intensity Engagement Intensity The engagement intensity (EI) is a metric of the extent to which the company is engaging on climate change policy matters, whether positively or negatively. It is a number from 0 (no engagement at all) to 100 (full engagement on all queries/data points). Clearly energy companies are more affected by climate regulations and will have a higher EI than, for example retailers. So an organization’s score should be looked at in conjunction with this metric to gauge the amount of evidence we are using in each case as a basis for scoring. On our scale, an EI of more than 35 indicates a relatively large amount of climate policy engagement. close Modifications to InfluenceMap Scoring Relationship Score, December 2020 A new batch of industry associations has been uploaded onto the InfluenceMap system and the relationship scores recalculated accordingly. Updated terminology, February 2021 We adjusted the terminology used to describe the queries running down the left-hand side of our scoring matrix and added additional explanatory text to the info-boxes. This has no impact on the scores and methodology. It has been done following user feedback to improve clarity. close Sector: All Sectors Head​quarters: Seoul , South Korea Official Web Site: http://www.kbcsd.or.kr Wikipedia: Details of Organization Score What do the 0,1,2 and NSs, NAs mean? Each cell in the organization's matrix presents a chance for us to assess each data source against our column of climate change policy queries. We score from -2 to 2, with negative scores representing evidence of obstructive influence. ""NA"" means ""not applicable"" and ""NS"" means ""not scored"" - that is we did not find any evidence either way. In both cases, the cell's weighting is re-distributed over others. Red and blue cells represent highly interesting negative or positive influence respectively. Full details can be found here. close QUERIES DATA SOURCES Main Web Site The main organizational Web site of the company and its direct links to major affiliates and attached documents. Social Media We search other media and sites funded or controlled by the organization, such as social media (Twitter, Facebook) and direct advertising campaigns of the organization. CDP Responses We assess and score responses to two questions from CDP's climate change information request (12.3 a & 12.3c) related to political influence questions (currently these are not numerically scored by the CDP process). Legislative Consultations Comments from the entity being scored on governmental regulatory consultation processes, including those obtained by InfluenceMap through Freedom of Information requests.

In addition we have been inviting a variety of artists from across the globe monthly like, Aphex Twin, Jeff Mills, Derrick May, Daft Pank, Arto Lindsay, James Blake, Africa Bambaataa, etc, any more. In the early evenings Metro sometimes host a culture school “Metro College” that picks up a variety of themes such as; minimal arts, movies, and talk shows . We also help to showcase Kyoto's culture through partnership with Kyoto City on events like the International Art Festival. Another AWESOME fact, we were ranked 14th on the list of “the weirdest places.""Read moreSuggest edits to improve what we show.Improve this listingFull viewAll photos (38)Tours and TicketsKyoto Virtual Tour26Walking ToursMansagama-pottery wheel experience-7Pottery Classes Kyoto Foodie Night Tour96Public Transportation ToursKyoto Early Bird Tour19Bus ToursKyoto Full-Day Private Tour with Nationally-Licensed Guide3Public Transportation Tours Nighttime All-Inclusive Local Eats and Streets, Gion and Beyond38Night ToursHidden Kyoto E-Biking tour220Bike ToursGion Walking Tour by Night118City ToursArashiyama Bamboo Bike Tour (Early Bird)92Bike ToursKyoto Private Custom Walking & Sightseeing Tour87Rail ToursKyoto Arashiyama & Sagano Walking Food Tour48Private and LuxuryKyoto Platinum Early Morning Tour3Bus ToursFull-Day Private Guided Tour to Kyoto Palaces and TemplesBus ToursNinja hands-on 1-hour Lesson in English at Kyoto --Entry level23Martial Arts Classes 2021PRIVATE Experience Tea Ceremony wearing a Kimono in Kyoto MAIKOYA122Cooking ClassesKyoto Arashiyama & Sagano Bamboo Private Tour with Nationally-Licensed Guide2Public Transportation ToursSecret Eastern Kyoto Biking Adventure43Private and LuxuryNinja Hands-on 2-hour Lesson in English at Kyoto - Elementary Level29Martial Arts Classes Arashiyama Rickshaw Tour and Japanese Foot Spa Combo in Kyoto8Private and LuxuryDaytime Kyoto -Nishiki Market and Gion District Cultural Walking Food Tour81City ToursAuthentic Kyoto Tea Ceremony: Camellia Flower Teahouse8Cooking ClassesNishiki Market Breakfast Walking Food Tour41Private and LuxurySamurai Sword Experience Tameshigiri at Samurai and Ninja Museum Kyoto6Sports Lessons Gion night walk tour2City ToursHighlights & Hidden Gems With Locals: Best of Kyoto Private Tour21City Tours5-Hour Guided Walking Tour - Walk in Kyoto, Talk in English44City ToursFamily cooking - Home meal at Home!52Cooking ClassesJapanese Tea Ceremony (Group session)67Art Classes The Charms of Kyoto at Night: Kickstart TourWalking ToursTea Ceremony in Kimono with licenced teacher11Cooking ClassesThe area Address82 Shimotsutsumicho, Sakyo-ku Ebisu Bldg. BF, Kyoto 606-8396 Kyoto PrefectureNeighborhood: City CenterNo district of Kyoto is quite as representative of its blended nature as the City Center. By day, the covered shopping arcades along Kawaramachi and Shijo Street bring deal hunters and fashionistas out in droves to peruse the clothing, accessories, gifts, and home goods offerings. When it grows dark, the City Center is a hip spot for nightlife, alive with bars and clubs. A trendy culinary scene and an abundance of local watering holes give the Center its youthful vibrancy. In contrast, the quieter areas of the City Center seem a world away, shielded from noise by the foliage of the public gardens and zen spaces surrounding the area's shrines, castles, and the Imperial Palace. These ancient and sacred spots are seamlessly folded into the scenery, providing a respite from the energy of the city, but close enough to put you directly back onto the pulse of the city when you're ready.Read moreFull viewBest nearbyRestaurants10,000 within 3 milesTrattoria Macedonia Yuki1070.4 mi$$ - $$$ • Italian • Pizza • MediterraneanSaishuan Shiraki2490.4 mi$$ - $$$ • Japanese • Asian • HealthyArash's Kitchen1,1470.4 mi$$ - $$$ • Indian • Asian • TurkishLa Locanda1340.2 mi$$$$ • Italian • Seafood • SoupsMizuki1080.2 mi$$$$ • Japanese • Steakhouse • SeafoodHafuu Honten7680.4 mi$$$$ • Japanese • SteakhouseFortune Garden Kyoto2750.4 mi$$ - $$$ • French • International • Vegetarian FriendlyQUÉ PASA390.3 mi$ • Mexican • American • Vegetarian FriendlyLe Bouchon1840.4 mi$$ - $$$ • French • EuropeanMughal Indian Restaurant1750.4 mi$$ - $$$ • Indian • Asian • HealthySee allAttractions1,275 within 3 milesTenrikyo Kawaramachi Daikyokai1466 ftPoints of Interest & Landmarks • Religious SitesSanshi Suimeisho60.1 miHistoric Walking AreasRitsumeikan Land of creation30.2 miMonuments & StatuesYoshidaya Site30.2 miMonuments & StatuesEbisugawa Hydroelectric Power Station30.2 miPoints of Interest & LandmarksRaisanyoshosaisanshisuimeisho20.2 miMonuments & StatuesThe Site of Seimikyoku40.2 miHistoric SitesGyogan Temple520.3 miHistoric Sites • Religious SitesShimogoryo Shrine380.3 miReligious SitesKyoto Museum of Crafts and Design1730.5 miHistory MuseumsSee allContributeWrite a reviewUpload a photoReviewsQ&AFiltersEnglish4.536 reviewsExcellent24Very good7Average3Poor1Terrible1Naoki NHamamatsu, Japan2 contributions0Super-super fascinating club!!!Oct 2018 • SoloThis is my first visit to Club Metro and... truly it’s BEYOND THE THINGS THAT DESCRIBABLE IN WORDS!Nice artists, super friendly staffs!

The people working there seemed super nice and I had a fun evening but the music wasn't really my taste. Since I've only been there once and it was on an event evening I can't say anything about a normal evening at Metro. I've heard the Drag Show takes place every month and it's definitely worth checking out but I've also heard it's the same every month so maybe worth checking out only once.Read moreWritten August 9, 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of TripAdvisor LLC.sarahdee110534 contributions2Good music, but really small and grungyJul 2017 • FriendsPros: This place really does have good music.Cons: It's really dark, small, cramped (almost no room to dance or move), and smokey. It's a good place if you're really particular about music, or if you're into the underground music scene. However, it's bad if you're looking for a good place to dance and party. The entrance fee is also kind of expensive ($15-$20).Read moreWritten December 7, 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of TripAdvisor LLC.Henry L9 contributions0Cool underground spot!Sep 2017I highly recommend club metro for the cool underground vibes, the interesting people, and the value. Unlike most clubs, metro situated itself in a subway station in Kyoto. This gives the club an exclusive and cool feel. Additionally, drinks and food don't break the bank--drinks were only ¥500 and a late night snack was ¥400. While at the club, I met both other foreigners and interesting locals. And despite going on a Tuesday night, the place had more people than I expected, but it still felt intimate enough. The conversations, shots, and music made the night a ton of fun! Check this place out.

They have a super varied lineup, excellent sound and good vibes all over. It is a miniature version of a club in Tel Aviv minus the drugs.Read moreWritten July 15, 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of TripAdvisor LLC.Stay129949Lisbon, Portugal80 contributions0Lively hidden night corner on a quiet citySep 2015 • FriendsVery nice spot to go at night far a drink and clubbing in a quiet city like Kyoto. If you speak some Japanese it will help to hang around. It's popular among university students but not only. Check the monthly schedule as depending on the night you may get a quite different atmosphere, from live music to techno, alternative, 80's and theme nights. It's located in a basement on the access to the subway. There's a convenience store on the ground floor with a more quiet coffee shop/bar upstairs if you wanna come out so catch some fresh air. If you cross the road you'll be at the Kamo-river bank. In a warm evening it's quite nice to sit there for a while or strolling along the river before heading back to your room. Been there several times since 2002. Last time was in November 2015. Still the same spirit.

Worth a visit if only once, if the music was better would probably go again but on a different night.

Here’s where to hit the dancefloor in Kyoto.WorldNightlifeClubsWorld lives up to its name by a) being extremely big, and b) hosting DJs from across the planet. There's a focus on techno, house, and electronica, and since it's spread over two floors dance fans are likely to hear something they're into. Even if the music's not your thing, it's a great place for a drink at the weekend and a spot of serious people-watching.Read moreMetroNightlifeClubsKyoto's club culture arguably began here in 1990, a Marutamachi venue with its adventurous ears wide open to all types of music. There are always international DJs on Metro's schedule, but you might also find hip indie bands or touring international rock bands gracing its stage. A 250-person capacity means it's a great spot for experiencing intimate performances.Read moreAdvertisingKitsune KyotoNightlifeClubsOpened in 2015, the 800-capacity Kitsune Kyoto boasts a festival atmosphere, a top-notch sound system and dazzling lights, allowing guests to totally immerse in electronic dance music over its two themed floors, 'land' and 'sea'. The weekends often see appearances from big-name artists and celebrity DJs.Read moreWeller's ClubNightlifeClubsThe Weller in question here is Paul Weller, the English singer-songwriter behind The Jam and The Style Council, as well as a long successful solo career. The so-called 'Modfather' of Britpop has apparently given his support to this atmospheric fan-bar, which, driven by a Wellerian spirit of adventure hosts a wide variety of events spanning many musical genres including new wave, soul and R&B, and Japanese rock. It's more a place for sitting back and relaxing than a place for dancing all night.Read moreAdvertisingSocratesNightlifeClubsBeloved by Kyoto's music geeks and outlaw punks, this 100-person capacity underground spot hosts everything from hardcore bands to experimental DJs, and the kind of devoted performers you won't catch anywhere else. If you're looking to get stuck into Kyoto's wild and often magical local music scene, you should head here.Read moreCafe La Siesta - 8bit EditionNightlifeClubsHow's this for a distinctly Japanese twist on retro-chic? This geek-hip cafe is wildly obsessed with video games from the 1980s and 1990s, when Japanese companies such as Sega and Nintendo (the latter based here in Kyoto) experienced enormous worldwide success. Events here tend to be on the nerdy side, and even the music comes in 8-bits. With a 30-person capacity, it's tiny, but if you can squeeze in – and you remember how to do the Gou-Hadoken move in Street Fighter II – this bar, with its Nintendos and Super Nintendos, will make you roll and jump like Sonic the Hedgehog.Read moreShow moreTime Out Tokyo Editors RecommendedPopular on Time OutYou may also likeAdvertisingCloseTime OutFollow usfacebooktwitterpinterestinstagramAbout usContact usTerms of useWork for Time OutTime Out GroupAdvertisingTime Out TokyoiPhone appMagazine subscriptionDigital editionBuy the guide to TokyoTime Out productsTime Out WorldwideSite Map© 2021 Time Out England Limited and affiliated companies owned by Time Out Group Plc.

It has a good number of modern, upmarket venues in the Kiyamachi and Pontocho districts – and if you’re willing to explore beyond these areas, you’ll also find cozier themed places where you can sit back with a cocktail, shot of sake, or sing karaoke. That said, to help you get started with finding the places that best fit your style, I show and describe 12 of the better clubs and bars below. Quick Section Navigation1 Kyoto’s Bars2 Kyoto’s Clubs3 Conclusion Kyoto’s Bars Bars in Kyoto are much more than just places to get a good drink.

Located in Pontocho, the bar has around 100 different sake varieties to choose from. They serve Japanese speakers only on weekends due to the staff on schedule, but don’t let that stop you from visiting on weeknights for a warm welcome to the world of sake.

283,"About the Institute | Institute of Economic Research, Kyoto University (KIER) About the Institute Access Researchers News Events All Micro/GameMacroeconomicsEconometricsUrban EconomicsCAPS Publications Contact JP About the Institute Address of Director Kyoto Institute of Economic Research Director Yoshihiko Nishiyama Over the last few decades, the world has experienced rapid globalization in many aspects of society. The world economy is increasing its competitiveness through active movements of people and goods between countries, pursuing more efficient resource allocation, and achieving great economic development. On the other hand, highly networked and large-scale economies have also exposed the vulnerabilities behind the pursuit of capitalist efficiency. Problems that cannot be dismissed as “temporary shocks” are occurring one after the other. These include financial crises, inequality, pressing environmental problems, enormous natural disasters, and unexpected infectious diseases. Some of these problems, by their very nature, require economics to solve them, while others require cooperation with other disciplines to develop countermeasures. In view of this situation, the demand from society for economics research and comprehensive integrated research across disciplines is increasing. The Institute of Economic Research (KIER) has two major roles. Needless to say, one is to advance current economic research, and the other is to educate and train young researchers who conduct future research of economics. In research, we aim to contribute to society through developments of economics in various aspects. Always keeping various real problems in mind, we implement theoretical analyses to elucidate the principles of human economic activities, then solving real problems by applying these principles to policy implementation. In order to advance research toward its realization by exchanging various discussions globally, we are constantly expanding and deepening our international research network by making use of our International Joint Research Center of Advanced Economic Theory. On the other hand, in education, we are involved in graduate student training as a faculty member of the Graduate School of Economics, and actively accept young researchers from Japan and abroad in various ways, such as research fellow of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science and foreign visiting researchers. In addition, the tenure track system was introduced in 2010 which was the earliest among research institutes in the field of social sciences at Kyoto University, opening a new door to the recruitment and training of young researchers. The institute is working to develop young researchers by providing them with the opportunity to constantly come into contact with cutting-edge international research results through the function of the Center and the system of visiting faculty members from abroad. KIER has significantly contributed to the development of economic sciences in Japan, both by conducting modern research activities in the sphere of economics, and as a center of education and research for joint usage and joint research projects which attracts many researchers from around the world. It will continue its unceasing efforts and strive to maintain its position as a center of development and creation in the sphere of economics. We would like to ask for the support and cooperation of many people toward the development of the institute. About KIER KIER (Kyoto Institute of Economic Research) is the comprehensive research centre for high-quality research with a focus on theoretical economics, applied economics and econometrics. Mainly contributing to the basic theoretical approaches, KIER has flexibly investigated contemporary research topics and policy recommendations. KIER started its research base as incorporated association “Comprehensive Research Institute of Economics” in 1955 and was officially founded as Institute of Economics attached to Kyoto University in 1962. KIER started as two divisions, industrial structure and comparative industry, and has grown rapidly in size and scope, today encompassing four divisions and two centres. In 2010, KIER was approved by the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) as a Joint Usage/Research Centre in the sphere advanced economics theory. In 2005, KIER has organized Centre for Advanced Policy Studies (CAPS) to promote the evidence-based policy making. The research of KIER has been interdisciplinary and advanced, at the forefront of economic theory. It has also been international, building a strong research network overseas. In addition, KIER considers education to be an important part of its mission, organizing various paths for young scholars. Below you will find an overview of KIER’s mission, its management structure and history, as well as information on KIER’s campuses and offices, its budget and personnel and its governance.

The theory holds that low market quality is a cause of many contemporary problems such as the US subprime housing loan crisis and the fraudulent corporate accounting that surfaced in the US after the dot-com collapse. The field was defined by conducting theoretical and empirical research on household behavior panel data, and disseminated through the publication of many papers, leading to positive interim appraisals. The program also built up cooperative relations with a worldwide network of universities and institutes. This Global COE program clarifies the dynamics of market quality in the actual economy, by setting out a new economic perspective that views the market as an endogenous unit. The many elements surrounding the market including laws, institutions, organizations, culture, ethics and customs are taken as the market infrastructure, and the dynamics of market quality and market infrastructure are identified. Conventional theories of markets and market structure have tended to be based on static analysis, a direct comparison between the actual market and the ideal conditions of perfect competition. Yet in reality few markets could be converted overnight to perfect competition. This program posits a spectrum of markets with differing qualities, with perfect competition at one end, along which the actual market gradually and endogenously moves according to changes in its infrastructure. The process is elucidated through theory, data and verification, using wide-ranging research on findings from panel data. This serves the field of economics by enabling the design and coordination of market infrastructure for gradual stimulation of market quality, thus determining paths for healthy development and growth. In the area of policy design, the program seeks to validate the effectiveness of a new principle: pursuing market quality through the prior, indirect method of market infrastructure coordination. At the same time, this Global COE fosters many young researchers who can develop the research in the future and take leadership in the improvement of market quality. Webpage of the Global COE Program on Human Behavior and Socioeconomic Dynamics (Kyoto University/Osaka University) Program Overview Building an economics based on human behavior depends on clarifying the mechanisms of human behavior from an economic standpoint. Specifically, it is important to measure preference parameters including time preference, risk aversion, altruism, impulsivity and liquidity preference. In this program the parameter measurement is performed by integrating traditional economics methods with methods of statistical analysis, hypothetical questions, economic experiments and neuroscience. The attributes of human preference derived through those methods provide the basis for clarifying socioeconomic dynamics that conventional analysis does not grasp. The specific research areas are: ① Preference and Wellbeing: Clarifying the preference characteristics such as time preferences, risk aversion or altruism and the relationship between feeling of wellbeing and economic circumstances ② Household Behavior: Analysis of domestic consumption and labor supply behavior, considering psychological aspects. ③ Business Behavior: Analysis of investment behavior, funding behavior and investor behavior. ④ Institutional Design: Efficient design of market systems and economic organizations. ⑤ Macroeconomics: Growth and business fluctuations. ⑥ Education and Training: Analysis of the economic effects of education and training. These areas are interrelated. What economics researchers are seeking is the ability, when confronted by a new economic problem, to develop new concepts and methods, propose solutions, and share findings with the global research community. To foster young researchers with those capacities, the program has put in place a thorough curriculum of basic common courses including a mathematics preparatory course for incoming graduate students. Doctoral students participate in COE project seminars to learn about panel research, economic experiments and other new research techniques. This type of educational structure fosters interdisciplinary researchers who are not confined to particular subject fields. Graduate students are also sent to international conferences and overseas trainings, and taught to prepare papers and presentations in English. This COE program continues to seek young researchers to take on a leading edge of economics. Academic Agreements KIER is widely known as an international research center for economic theory. The International Journal of Economic Theory, which is published jointly with Keio University, is highly regarded as a global specialist journal, and is the first international journal of economic theory edited primarily by Japanese researchers. Further, in addition to establishing posts for non-Japanese visiting teachers and inviting world-leading researchers, KIER is also engaged in various joint international research, and is ceaselessly visited by non-Japanese researchers. In light of this track record, KIER has signed agreements with overseas universities in America, France, and elsewhere, and is actively engaging in research exchange. Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry, Japan An agreement for academic cooperation and exchanges was concluded July 1, 2007 with the Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry (RIETI), Japan. Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry (RIETI) is a non-civil service style incorporated administrative agency, established in April 1, 2001 to spark creative and original policy discussion on the basis of global-level analysis and policy research from middle to long-term strategic viewpoints.

Research is conducted as detailed below in three areas: macroeconometric analysis, microeconometric analysis, and experimental economics. There has been fresh development in the field of empirical analysis, which frames economic activity in terms of quantitative data and performs statistical analysis to clarify the behavioral principles of economic agents and the laws of motion of economics. As the growth of computing power has enabled efficient statistical analysis of large volumes of data, microeconomic data on households and businesses is being analyzed in relation to theories of economic agent behavior. This is the emerging field of microeconometric analysis, where remarkable progress has been made in using panel data with simultaneous time-variant and cross-sectional components, and in developing analytical techniques for qualitative data that are not quantitatively describable. Collecting and maintaining microeconometric data, from such sources as surveys and pseudo-panels, will have increasing importance in the future. Our research is designed to contribute to the development of the field of microeconometric analysis by combining econometric theory with applied microeconomics and applied microeconometric analysis of data from fields such as labor economics, corporate finance, industrial organization and environmental economics. The methods at the core of empirical macroeconomic analysis are time series analysis of macroeconomic data attributes, and calibration of macroeconomic models through comparisons of simulated data with actual economic data. The goal of macroeconometric analysis research area is exploring the linkages between time series-based econometric theory, macroeconomic theory and empirical macroeconomic analysis in order to further develop the cutting-edge field of macroeconometric analysis. There have also been striking developments recently in the use of experimental methods in economics. Our research is designed to develop the field of experimental economics by utilizing experimental economics and field survey techniques, mainly in the area of environmental issues. Economic Systems Research Division This division proposes wide-ranging, comprehensive understandings of the formation, change and design potentials of social and economic structures, systems and conventions, grounded in findings from comparisons of economic and social systems, analysis of business organizations, and analysis of societal decision-making. Organizational and systems analysis are the main approaches, and trade and growth analysis is also included in order to more effectively establish the practice of institutional systems analysis in economics research. Systems Analysis involves the design, comparison and assessment of economic systems from a broad view, on the basis of theoretical and empirical studies of various economic and social systems in comparison to models such as the market system. The processes through which systems form, develop and change are verified from a dynamic perspective. These techniques are supplemented with research that draws on methods and knowledge in politics, history, sociology, and technical science. Organizational Analysis uses contract theory and other typical methods of economic analysis, which can now be applied to not only business organizations but many kinds of organizations and phenomena, to analyze the internal structure, formation and differentiation of organizations, and relationships between them. Feedback from empirical findings is also emphasized. Strong linkages with related fields, such as business management and law, are anticipated. Trade and Growth Analysis is based on the theory of imperfect competition, contract theory, and organizational theory, and is applied to a wide range of multinational corporations and national growth records. Empirical research is conducted on international trade and foreign direct investment, using theoretical findings and company-level microdata to assess the impacts of financial policies on economic growth. Deepening of both the theoretical and empirical approaches holds great promise for research on trade and growth. Economic Strategy Research Division This division was established in 2009 to carry on and deepen the work of the Public Policy Department, which had conducted research to link the findings of economic theory to policy planning. The division prepares and disseminates the most advanced theoretical research, and is building a reputation for delivering agile, systematic and citable investigations of policy issues. The research is particularly focused on strategic behavior, which holds an important place in advanced economic theory. The division’s economic strategy research falls under three categories of theory and policy analysis: Game Theory, the state of the art in economic strategy, analyzes the key theory subjects of personal and collective decision-making under conditions of uncertainty and dynamics. Market Economy Strategy research takes strategic business relationships as the foundation of market economics (fundamental economics), and generates wide-angle studies of economic phenomena to serve as frameworks for policy analysis. Environment and Public Policy research addresses strategic policy systematization across the areas of environmental issues, international economy, financial markets, and fiscal and monetary policy. The game theory research embraces personal decision-making theory, which remains at the leading edge of economic theory, as well as various strategy theories and their methodologies. The department’s work has been published and otherwise shared with international colleagues. The research is designed to strengthen theoretical foundations and applications in the areas of decision-making theory incorporating findings from behavioral economics; systematic analysis of games of incomplete information; the problems of infinite-horizon dynamic game theory; and cooperative game theory. The research on market economy strategy views markets in the broadest sense, and includes analyzing the strategic behavior of businesses, consumers, governments, etc., investigating methods for evaluating market performance, and comparing the results of competition policies. Research on environment and public policy applies strategy analysis to key topics of global economics including fiscal and monetary policy, international economics, and environmental economics, building on the legacy of the predecessor Public Policy Department. The main purposes are prompt preparation of proposals and assessments for flexible policies, and systematic analysis of the strategic topics common to all fields, which are the foundation of policy. Finance Research Division This division has made permanent the work in financial engineering and finance research and education that had been carried out for a decade by the privately sponsored Research Center for Financial Engineering. Following the recent global financial crisis, the division has sought to address on the broadest levels issues ranging from risk management options for financial markets, to market inflation requirements for improving market quality and the roles of organizations, customs and ethics in the creation of desirable financial markets, as well as behavioral finance theory. Another goal is to analyze what measures will be required to prevent recurrence of the factors and risks that were exposed in the crisis. Emphasis is also placed on risk management in organizations. The specific research areas are risk management, market quality, mathematical finance, financial econometric analysis, and international financial economics. Additional research is under way on economic revitalization and countermeasures against future risks to the Japanese economy, in close collaboration with the other KIER divisions.

In this overview, I’ll explain the the Leaders Club loyalty program: Membership tiers & benefits Pros & things I like about Leaders Club Cons & things I don’t like about Leaders Club My reviews of luxury hotels covered by Leaders Club Key points Poll: what’s the best hotel loyalty program? This slideshow requires JavaScript. LEADERS CLUB : MEMBERSHIP TIERS & BENEFITS There are the three tiers within the Leaders Club program: Club membership is the base level, and comes with the following benefits: Upgrade priority at arrival, subject to availability Complimentary continental breakfast for two each day Complimentary internet access Early check-in and late check-out, subject to availability One pre-arrival upgrade per year (after your first paid stay) Exclusive members-only offers and rates Earning hotel points (1 point per 1 USD spend) towards free nights Sterling membership requires a minimum spend of USD 5,000 USD on room rates at LHW properties per calendar year. Sterling membership commences on the date you earn Sterling status and will continue through December 31st of the following calendar year. For example, status earned in April 2019 will last through 31st December 2020. Sterling membership gets you the following benefits : Upgrade priority at arrival, subject to availability Complimentary continental breakfast for two each day Complimentary internet access Early check-in and late check-out, subject to availability Five pre-arrival upgrades per year Exclusive members-only offers and rates Earning hotel points (1 point per 1 USD spend) towards free nights An annual renewal points bonus, equal to 5% of the room rate you spend in USD or the currency equivalent, excluding taxes and fees, during the membership year immediately preceding your membership renewal. Aurelian membership is the program’s premium and invitation-only tier, awarded to travelers who belong to LHW’s top 1% of customers (minimum $10,000 USD spend on room rates per calendar). In addition to the Sterling benefits, Aurelian members also get: Complimentary one-way airport to hotel transfers in 30 cities (capped at $300 USD per membership year). An annual renewal points bonus, equal to 8,8 % of the room rate you spend in USD or the currency equivalent, excluding taxes and fees, during the membership year immediately preceding your membership renewal. Unlimited number of upgrade requests (one category – no suites) No blackout dates on point awards PROS & THINGS I LIKE ABOUT LEADERS CLUB In July 2021, LHW made its Leaders Club program complimentary to everyone (prior to this date, one had to pay an annual fee of $170 USD for Leaders Club membership).  This free Leaders Club membership gets you one pre-arrival upgrade awarded annually, complimentary daily breakfast for two, access to members-only savings, priority for upgrades, early check-in and late check-out. Now at no cost to you. For clarity, bookings must be made via the Leading Hotels of the World website to receive the benefits above (bookings made directly with the hotel do not count). As a Leaders Club member, you can enjoy benefits across some of the most iconic and luxurious hotels of the word, such as the 12 Apostles Hotel in Cape Town, The Datai Langkawi in Malaysia, Hotel Adlon Kempinski in Berlin, Le Sirenuse in Positano (Italy), Laucala Island in Fiji, The Setai Miami Beach, and The Ritz in Paris. You can access the full list of LHW hotels here. So when you consider several stays at one or multiple of the 375 remarkably uncommon properties, it’s worth signing up for the program. The LHW collection mainly consists of independent high-end hotels that work together under the LHW umbrella to increase their sales, marketing, and revenue. Remarkably, the LHW portfolio does include some properties that are managed by luxury hotel chains, such as a few Kempinski, Constance, and One&Only hotels. Leaders Club members have access to special rates and offers at LHW hotels across the globe, with up to 20% off the best available rate with every booking. These rates are available exclusively for Leaders Club members and are not available anywhere else. Simply search hotels and rates, then sign-in as a Leaders Club member to view the discounted rates. Leaders Club members earn one Leaders Club point for every USD they spend on the room rate at a LHW hotel for each qualifying stay, with a maximum of three rooms per booking. Your Leaders Club account must be activated and associated with the booking prior to your arrival to earn Leaders Club points for that stay. These points can be used for free hotel nights at other LHW properties, with redemptions beginning at 4,000 points. Leaders Club is one of the very few programs that rewards loyalty for stays at luxury hotels. Hotels using the program make efforts to reward their most loyal guests. In comparison, hotel chains such as Four Seasons, Rosewood, Aman, and Banyan Tree do not offer a loyalty program. The program is uncomplicated and thus very easy to understand. You collect points that you can spend on free nights and you also get some benefits at LHW properties. As long as a member keeps traveling with Leading Hotels their membership will not expire, and neither will the points they accrued. CONS & THINGS I DON’T LIKE ABOUT LEADERS CLUB Most LHW properties belong to Virtuoso portfolio. As such, you will receive many of the same benefits when booking via Virtuoso as you would get as a Leaders Club member. So the program definitely isn’t the only way to get VIP perks at the hotels that are part of the LHW portfolio. In addition, Virtuosos also offers an additional benefit, usual $100 USD of food and beverage credit per stay, which you don’t get via Leaders Club. Benefits can only be enjoyed as long as you make your bookings via the official LHW website or through one of LHW’s worldwide reservations and service centers. Making your booking directly on the official hotel website will not get you any benefit. Leaders Club is one of the few hotel loyalty schemes that does not earn you frequent flyer miles. Redemptions begin at 4,000 points but it’s not clear how many points you need per property (the number of points probably fluctuates depending on the season and room rate). So basically, you are engaging yourself into a program with very vague terms & conditions. Leaders Club has a pathetic best rate guarantee program. If you find a lower rate for your reservation within 24 hours of booking with them, they simply match it without applying any additional discount. The pre-arrival upgrades are only valid for rooms, not suites. MY REVIEWS OF LUXURY HOTELS COVERED BY LEADERS CLUB Hotel review: the Datai Langkawi (Malaysia) Review: The Langham London Hotel (United Kingdom) Review: San Clemente Palace Venice (Italy) Review of The Lanesborough London Review: Oman’s most stylish resort, The Chedi Muscat Review: The Reverie Saigon, Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam) Review: Mezzatorre Resort & Spa (Ischia Island, Italy) Review: The Fontenay Hotel Hamburg (Germany) Review of Maia Luxury Resort & Spa (Seychelles) Review of The Dolder Grand Hotel (Zürich, Switzerland)  Review: The Chedi Andermatt Hotel (Switzerland)  Review: The Lodhi New Delhi (India) The Leading Hotels of the World’s loyalty program is now free KEY POINTS LHW’s loyalty program, Leaders Club, can only accessed by paying a fee. The program is useless since you can get the same benefits (without paying an annual fee) when booking LHW hotels via Virtuoso.

Our goal is to challenge teens to serve the community, and to help them grow in who they are and lead those around them. Leaders Club includes weekly meetings, service and social events, as well as trips throughout the year including rallies, service work weekends, optional spring break trips and Blue Ridge Leaders School. Ages YMCA Middle School Leaders Club serves teens in grades 6 - 8 and YMCA High School Leaders Club serves teens in grades 9 - 12. Clubs are hosted and meet at local YMCA branches.

This may influence which products we review and write about (and where those products appear on the site), but it in no way affects our recommendations or advice, which are grounded in thousands of hours of research. Our partners cannot pay us to guarantee favorable reviews of their products or services. Here is a list of our partners.Your Guide to Leaders Club, the Loyalty Program of Leading Hotels of the WorldThis loyalty program has an annual membership fee, but it comes with room upgrades at its high-end hotels.Ramsey QubeinJun 7, 2021Many or all of the products featured here are from our partners who compensate us. This may influence which products we write about and where and how the product appears on a page. However, this does not influence our evaluations. Our opinions are our own. Here is a list of our partners and here's how we make money.The Leading Hotels of the World is a collection of more than 400 of the world’s finest hotels, including palace hotels, boutique and design properties, and beach resorts.Its loyalty program is called Leaders Club and, like other hotel loyalty programs, it offers a range of perks. But one notable difference sets it apart from other programs: Leaders Club charges a fee for membership. Still, the $175 annual fee comes with instant benefits that can make it worthwhile if you’re staying more than a couple of nights at LHW properties in a year.Members earn points for their stays, which they can redeem for stays later. Here are the details on the Leading Hotels of the World's Leaders Club.What hotels participate in Leaders Club?You won’t find bargain-priced hotels in the LHW portfolio — the property list includes some of the world's famous hotels, appealing to well-traveled, well-heeled guests looking for luxury and style.The well-known hotels in Europe include Hotel Sacher in Vienna and the Ritz Paris, while LHW hotels in the ultra-luxe destinations of Monaco and St. Moritz include the swanky Kulm Hotel St. Moritz. In Asia, there’s the Palace Hotel Tokyo and the towering, modern Reverie Saigon in Vietnam.Stateside, there’s The Lowell and The Knickerbocker in New York City and Nobu Hotel Miami Beach, among others.» Learn more: The latest in travel newsHow do you earn points?Once you pay the annual membership fee and join, the Leaders Club benefits, and the ability to earn and redeem points, kick in for one year.Nerdy tip: It's best to wait to enroll until shortly before your first stay to maximize your time in the program.To be eligible for benefits and to earn and redeem points, you must book a hotel stay online via LHW.com, its reservations center or with a travel agent. You cannot book directly via a hotel website since it isn't an approved LHW channel.Members earn 1 point for every dollar they spend on the room rate (on as many as three rooms per booking). Unlike in other programs, charges such as food and beverage or spa don't count toward points earning. However, the ability to earn on up to three rooms is great for families or friends traveling together.There’s an elite status category, known as Leaders Club Sterling, for members who spend at least $5,000 on qualifying stays within a calendar year. It comes with five pre-arrival suite upgrades and a one-time points bonus equal to 5% of your qualifying annual spend in the previous membership year. An invitation-only level, known as Aurelian, is given to the group’s highest spenders and comes with special benefits (as well as a higher annual fee).Elite status qualification is based on earnings during the calendar year, rather than your specific joining date in Leaders Club.How do you redeem points?A free night redemption begins at 4,000 points, which means you would have to spend $4,000 before achieving enough points for an award night.There are no award charts. The number of points needed for a night is based on the dates and current rates of an individual property, with blackout dates being determined by each individual hotel. The only way to see availability and rates is by searching for your preferred dates.When you pay for your stay with points, you receive the benefits of being a Leaders Club member, just as you do when paying cash.If you choose not to renew your Leaders Club membership, any points in your account will no longer be valid for redemption. But if you have a change of heart within 30 days of membership expiration, you can recoup those points by renewing for another year.What are the benefits?During the first year, members receive a pre-arrival upgrade with their first stay. In the next calendar year of membership, they receive another. To use it, members must request it when making a reservation, and if available, it will be confirmed online within three days of their stay.Members get early check-in and late checkout privileges (based on availability), daily continental breakfast for two (only for one room) and free wireless Internet as well as members-only rates and discounts.At check-in, guests are eligible for a one-category room upgrade based on availability if they haven’t already requested a pre-arrival room upgrade at the time of reservation.How Leaders Club compares with other hotel rewards programsThese benefits are similar to programs like the American Express Fine Hotels & Resorts program and Chase’s Luxury Hotel & Resort Collection. These program rates often come with an on-property amenity like a food, beverage or spa credit or a welcome gift. But for the AmEx and Chase programs, you qualify by carrying a certain credit card. In Leading Hotels of the World, instead of having to carry a specific credit card, members pay the $175 annual fee.Another difference: Booking directly with Leading Hotels of the World assures the lowest rate. Booking a hotel through the Chase or AmEx credit card programs sometimes leads to a slightly higher rate, which can be offset by the value of the benefits received.Photo courtesy of The Reverie SaigonMember hotels sometimes gift first-year Leaders Club memberships, presumably to high-spending or frequent guests (the company doesn’t publicize the how or why of free memberships). For example, The Reverie Saigon in Vietnam has taken care of the one-year enrollment fee for select guests.Is the Leaders Club right for you?If you stay at LHW properties, Leaders Club could make sense. Upgrades, free continental breakfast, the best room rates and other perks will, for some travelers, more than outweigh the $175 fee. Plus, you get to wake up in some of the most luxurious addresses in the world.How to Maximize Your RewardsYou want a travel credit card that prioritizes what’s important to you.
