Students complement their core Master`s programme with dedicated courses enabling them to understand the magnitude of the challenge, to explore the range of possible solutions, to craft behaviorally informed strategies, and to shape a positive future in a carbon-constrained world. Learn more about the programme CEMS Model UNFCCC Climate Change Course and Simulation Climate change is one of the most pressing issues, affecting all of today’s business related processes. The impact of climate change will change the international business environment dramatically. However, the business relevance of climate change is insufficiently understood by future decision makers in international management and society. The Climate Change Course and its ʺModel UNFCCCʺ is an innovative educational approach to close this knowledge gap. Its goal is to broaden studentsʹ understanding of climate change and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and its impact on the future of business. The course is held simultaneously at 10 leading CEMS universities and ends with a tow-day simulation of global climate negotiations in which around 150 students from all participating schools come together.

Bachelor Transcript* CV:* Motivation Letter:* Max. 1 page – including motivation letter for selecting and knowledge of the selected topic (experience with the topic, relevant courses attended, etc.) Research Proposal:* I hereby accept the privacy policy privacy policy of this website Evaluation Criteria Special Call - Chair of Sustainability Management add Environmental Sustainability in Boards of Directors of SMEs According to the World Bank, 90% of businesses are small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and are an essential part of supply chains. SMEs are therefore central to achieving green transformation on topics such as carbon neutrality, circular business models, and biodiversity loss. At the same time, SMEs face many challenges including financial survival in the context of COVID-19. Leaders of such organizations can be overwhelmed with the question of how to embed sustainability into the company’s strategy, setting suitable short and long-term targets, and how to monitor and assess the company’s sustainability activities. This Masters research thesis aims to investigate the question: How can boards directors of Swiss SMEs become savvy on environmental sustainability? The role of board directors is supervisory by definition, and for many board directors, sustainability or ESG is a new topic. Even among large companies, only 6% of board directors have experience on environmental topics and 20% on social topics. We are seeking a Master’s student to study this topic, which was designed in collaboration with industry partners in Switzerland. Questions that the student will explore include understanding how Swiss SME board directors acquire the necessary knowledge on environmental sustainability, how they monitor the SME’s sustainability activities, and the reporting measures, tools, and methods used. The study will likely adopt a qualitative approach via interviews with board directors of Swiss SMEs. The aim is to identify challenges and best practices that provide pragmatic insights. Contact Chair of Management of Renewable Energies add Level: Bachelor and Master At the Chair of Management of Renewable Energies, we are currently experiencing high levels of student interest in writing Master or Bachelor theses. While we are excited about the interest on these important topics, our capacity prevents us from satisfying every request for supervision. We will selectively consider new requests if they have a close link to our team’s research focus, and if the candidate can demonstrate dedication and commitment to investigating a novel topic related to managing renewable energy and climate solutions. All else being equal, students who have already familiarized themselves with the topic in one of our courses will be given priority in the application process. Do you think you have what we are looking for? Then please take a moment to check the website of the eligible supervisors in our team: Dr. Karoline Gamma Dr. Merla Kubli Prof. Dr. Moritz Loock Dr. Adrian Rinscheid Prof. Dr. Rolf Wüstenhagen Once you have identified the lecturer who is the best match with your research interest, contact her/him with a short CV, motivation letter, grade transcript and short description of 1-2 proposed thesis topic(s).

Special Topic Art and Science Our special topic ""Art and Science"" presents HSG researchers in their role as creators of art. Thrillers, music, pictures and folklore are created not only as a counterbalance to being a researcher, but often as a complement to it. Monitoring climate pollutants from space Global CO2 emissions are a blind spot on the data map. The HSG research team led by Prof. Damian Borth and Dr. Michael Mommert wants to change that. Using satellite images, they will soon be able to locate all fossil fuel power plants worldwide in order to track down pollutant emitters. Our core values - the new HSG Ethics Code As a mandate from the Compliance Action Plan, the University of St.Gallen has developed the new HSG Ethics Code. It is to be understood as a necessary complement to the HSG’s vision, mission and objectives.

(in German) HSG Impact Award 2021: Staying on Top of the Crisis The Corona pandemic began as a public health crisis. However, it quickly affected almost every aspect of life. This included the global economy. During a crisis, businesses and policy makers need accurate and up-to-date information. Unfortunately, this information is not always available. Prof. Dr. Charlotta Sirén, Research Associate Michael Hudecheck, Prof. Ph.D. Joakim Vincent and Prof. Dr. Dietmar Grichnik tackled this problem in their research project ""Staying on Top of the Crisis"". HSG Impact Award 2021: Portfolio model for sustainable investments Sustainable investments are among the most important trends in the capital markets. They take into account verifiable criteria from the environmental, social, and responsible corporate governance fields. At the University of St.Gallen, Prof. Dr. Sebastian Utz developed a novel portfolio model. It mutually optimizes risk, return, and sustainability impact and makes it possible to identify unused sustainability in investments and efficiently redirect capital towards sustainable challenges. (in German) HSG Impact Award 2021: Monitoring Consumption Switzerland The Corona pandemic paralyzed the global economy within a few weeks. Production, trade, and consumption came to a brief standstill in the spring of 2020. Consumption by private households plays a crucial role in assessing the economic situation, as it accounts for about 50% of Switzerland's gross domestic product. But how can consumption be measured and analyzed in real-time? The ""Monitoring Consumption Switzerland"" dashboard developed by Prof. Dr. Martin Brown and Prof. Dr. Matthias Fengler provides detailed weekly data on consumption expenditure in Switzerland.

Which key figures are decisive for an assessment of the pandemic situation? And why only intelligent control can make the fragmented healthcare system future-proof. (in German) Truly Sustainable Strategies Although many companies are committed to sustainability, environmental and social crises are advancing. This is partly because many companies' strategies tend to view sustainability as a means to an end of financial success. The Truly Sustainable Strategies approach, on the other hand, places the addressing of existing sustainability challenges at the center of corporate action. Dr. Tabea Bereuther from the Institute for Economy and the Environment at the HSG has taken a closer look at these strategies in her dissertation. Strategic partnership between Credit Suisse and the University of St.Gallen Credit Suisse and the University of St.Gallen are entering into a strategic partnership that will encompass three specific areas of funding. In the context of this partnership, Credit Suisse will contribute CHF 20 million over the next ten years. Academic GIFts: Academia and Populism Populists promise to bring power back to ""the people"". They value ""wisdom of the crowds"" more than scientific expertise. But what about those populist leaders who are scientific experts themselves? Online lectures deepen inequality among students Due to the pandemic, universities moved their lectures into the virtual space. Researchers from the HSG, the University of Geneva and the EPF Lausanne have now investigated the impact of this shift on student performance. In the Lab: Transformatics In our new video series ""In the Lab"", we shed light on research projects in the making, provide insights into initial interim results and show where the research journey is headed. In the first episode, cultural and media scientist Prof. Dr. Jörg Metelmann and organisational psychologist and transformation consultant Dr. Björn Müller explain their interdisciplinary research project ""Transformatics"". (in German, English Subtitles) The manipulation of the chatbots Many companies use chatbots to communicate with their customers. Depending on how they are designed, they can have more or less influence on buying behaviour. Very subtle features also play a role. If the boss is an algorithm Artificial intelligence is advancing in the field of personnel management: whether it is being used to find suitable employees for open positions or to monitor and evaluate the work of and performance of current employees… and this can all be done automatically. Where have these types of algorithms already taken over executive positions in Switzerland and what effects this can have on the relationship between employees and their company? These topics have been investigated by the Research Institute for Work and Working Environments at the HSG (FAA-HSG). This video also examines what is legally permissible in regard to surveillance in the workplace. HSG Impact Award 2020: Decentralized Insurance on the Blockchain Natural disasters and extreme weather conditions are increasing globally. The effects of these extreme events are often far worse in emerging markets than in developed economies. For their low-income populations, insurance cover is often not offered or is unaffordable. The HSG researchers Professor Alexander Braun and Niklas Häusle are convinced that an innovative, decentralised insurance model based on block chain technology has the potential to mitigate these problems. HSG Impact Award 2020: Business Model Innovation for the Circular Economy Sustainability is becoming increasingly important for a growing number of companies. Not least because customers are also attaching greater importance to climate and environmental protection. As early as 2012, a research project was launched which offers companies a management tool for business model innovation: the ""Business Model Navigator"". An interdisciplinary team led by Professor Karolin Frankenberger further developed this approach. The aim: to link the topic of sustainability and business model innovation and to develop sustainable, future-oriented business models that focus on ""circular economy"". (in German) HSG Impact Award 2020: Quartierstrom - A platform for sustainable energy supply Switzerland's energy supply is at a turning point: away from fossil fuels and nuclear energy and towards a sustainable energy supply using renewable energies. Here decentralised energy supply systems, which rely on local photovoltaic systems, are becoming increasingly important. A national pilot project of the University of St.Gallen, headed by Professor Felix Wortmann, developed a solution in collaboration with ETH Zurich: the ""Quartierstrom"" energy platform. The basic idea: locally produced electricity should be consumed locally. (in German) Gudrun Sander on diversity as a management task Prof. Dr. Gudrun Sander on the advantages of heterogeneous teams in challenging times of crisis. How can the diversity of employees be used to achieve corporate goals? And why is diversity management first and foremost a management task? (in German) Prof. Fabrizio Zilibotti on the economic side of the COVID 19 pandemic How could the economic consequences be mitigated? Which macroeconomic measures could be helpful in this respect? And what does this crisis mean for Europe and Switzerland? Quality versus efficiency in healthcare? In areas such as health care or education, there is high cost pressure. At the same time, this type of service can only be made more efficient to a limited extent, as direct interpersonal contact is often essential for its benefit.

A team of IWÖ researchers led by Martina Rothenberger and Rolf Wüstenhagen took a closer look at the recent referendum against Switzerland’s revised CO2 law. Their particular focus was on the influence of emotional dynamics on the perception of costs and benefits of climate policy. Contrary to high initial approval rates, the revision of the CO2 law was rejected by 51.6 % of voters on June 13, 2021. How did this opinion swing come about, and what can be learned for designing energy and climate policies that are contested in a referendum campaign? Based on a representative survey of Swiss voters (N=757), the researchers suggest that negative emotions currently prevail, whereas motivating voters for climate policy measures requires taking a closer look at co-benefits such as health, energy independence or the pleasure of low-carbon travel. Furthermore, a majority of voters overestimated the cost of the planned aviation tax, and were unaware of the financial benefits of redistribution of CO2 taxes.

Yet, organizational fields often include small numbers of organizations that resist prevalent institutionalized norms. We study what sets institutional resistors apart from their conforming peers. We hypothesize that organizations with features which shield them from institutional pressures (reduced susceptibility) or compel them to ignore specific norms (reduced receptivity) are most likely to follow a strategy of institutional resistance. Empirically, we focus on major publicly traded corporations resisting mounting pressures to include women on boards. We find support for our hypotheses in a panel of S&P500 firms from 2003-2012. Specifically, all-male boards are more likely in firms which are comparatively less visible than their peers or primarily engage in business-to-business sales, reducing their susceptibility to institutional pressures. Moreover, all-male boards are more likely in firms with more inside directors, older directors, as well as those head-quartered in more conservative communities, reducing their receptivity for the institutional norm in question. We discuss implications for institutional theory and research on corporate social responsibility.

Corporate leaders like CEOs, top managers, and board directors are faced with decisions about how to create value from addressing major sustainability topics that affect business like pollution/emissions and waste created through industrial and agricultural processes, rapid biodiversity loss, and land use changes. At our Chair, we consider what business models are most effective to address sustainability, the corporate governance of sustainability strategy, and the influence of stakeholders. arrow_upward Research Focus Projects Team Publications Contact Research Focus on the topic of corporate sustainability management Corporate Sustainability Governance CEOs, top management teams, and boards of directors all affect how sustainability is governed at corporationsthrough incentives, structures, and processes. Our research considers how and why corporate leaders and executives monitor and control their company’s sustainability performance, in the context of external institutional drivers such as investor- and stakeholder-activism, large-scale societal trends and Grand Challenges. Microfoundations of Corporate Sustainability Human psychology and social pressure determine sustainability behavior at the individual, organizational, and collective/societal levels. We investigate the role of emotions, values, motivation and cognition in driving corporate sustainability in the context of stakeholder pressure and social movements. We also research the paradoxical tensions that arise and how managers resolve these to push the corporate sustainability agenda. Corporate Sustainability Strategy Companies apply new business models to address sustainability topics and created shared value for the organization and its stakeholders. Our research considers how companies improve their sustainability performance within the company, along supply chains or through a network of collaborations. We also consider the conditions under which companies greenwash by decoupling their communication around sustainability from their actions. Ongoing Projects Chair for Sustainability Management Corporate Biodiversity Governance Biodiversity is rarely addressed in corporate environmental governance. Yet, biodiversity in ecosystems represents the variety of all life on Earth that supports vital functions like pollination, water purification, nutrient cycling, and climate regulation. Since nature has a distant and indirect impact on corporations, we consider how and when corporate leaders attend to biodiversity. In this project, we consider how individual-level behavioral aspects of managers affect the way in which biodiversity is perceived and governed. Emotions in Contested Industries Trophy hunting—the hunting for pleasure—is a socially contested and morally disputed industry and the debate around it has become a ‘culture war.’ Central to the debate are emotions. Opponents and proponents of the industry experience and use collective emotions to challenge and defend the industry; but the use of emotions differs drastically between anti- and pro-trophy hunting stakeholders. The aim of this project is to understand how emotional processes can polarize sustainability debates, and what can be done to resolve such conflict.

Video Latest Publications add_circle Wanted: Heroic Leaders to Drive the Transition to ‘Business Beyond Usual’ IN: Strategic Organization, 2020 Judith L Walls, Ashley Salaiz, Shih-Chi (Sana) Chiu Journal paper Business-as-usual is likely to drive us to an unsustainable world. To solve the problems human industrial activity has created, such as climate change, species extinction, and biodiversity loss, business leaders (CEOs, top managers, and boards of directors) must be central to the solution for corporate sustainability (CS). In particular, ‘heroic’ leaders are needed to transform their companies into business beyond usual. In this essay, we briefly outline what researchers already know about microfoundational or socio-cognitive and motivational underpinnings of leaders that affect CS. However, gaps remain in our understanding of affective drivers and values of leaders. We question whether microfoundations research has the potential to understand true business transformation for positive deviance and suggest that positive organizational scholarship and research on sustainability change agents can provide insights. We next highlight how empirical and research design shortcomings might be addressed. Finally, we discuss how to identify, develop, and empower leaders with transformational potential so that we can proactively create heroic leaders rather than wait for them to magically appear.

Regulation and Governance, 13, 197-219. get_appMiron Avidan, Dror Etzion, Joel Gehman Journal paper How do the material aspects of intermediary work affect regulators, targets, and beneficiaries? To shed light on this question, we studied an information intermediary in the form of a website and the organizations who founded it. Specifically, we analyzed FracFocus, a self-regulatory initiative with strong industry ties, charged with disclosing data pertaining to the chemicals used in oil and gas wells completed using hydraulic fracturing technology (fracking) in the United States and Canada. We found that between 2010 and mid-2017, the vast majority of legislation in states and provinces where fracking actively occurred was updated to mandate or encourage disclosure via FracFocus, meaning that it had a considerable effect on the trajectory of official regulation on fracking disclosure. We also found that FracFocus disclosed important data but did so in a manner that limited accessibility and reduced the comprehensibility of environmental and public health risks to beneficiaries. Our analysis suggests that the public’s experience of such a device is one of opaque transparency, in which the line between official and non-official regulation is blurred. We traced these outcomes to the material affordances created by FracFocus. More add_circle Leadership Change and Corporate Social Performance: The Context of Financial Distress Makes all the Difference IN: Leadership Quarterly, 2019 S.C. Chiu, Judith Walls Journal paper Change in strategic leadership has important implications for corporate social performance (CSP) and sustainability. As new CEOs have a strong incentive to attend to a broad set of stakeholders to build their trust and reputation within the firm, our study draws on stakeholder salience theory to examine a boundary condition, the presence of financial distress, that might challenge a new CEO’s ability to perform such a task. We examine the differential impacts between externally recruited CEOs (outsiders) and internally promoted CEOs (insiders) on CSP under the condition of financial distress. We argue that when firms experience financial distress, outsider CEOs can more quickly shift their attention and prioritize the interests of shareholders over other stakeholders than insider CEOs. Our study contributes to the strategic leadership and CSP literatures by offering new insights into how corporate leadership turnover and firm context may jointly shape new CEO’s decision-making in CSP engagement. More add_circle How to hire a change agent. Judith Walls Digital Resource Look for certain qualities to identify employees who will tackle a company’s sustainability challenges. We all know the traditional interview questions, such as “What are your strengths and weaknesses?” “Why do you want to work at our company?” But what do you ask if you’re looking for someone who can move the company toward better social and environmental performance? Research that colleagues and I have conducted provides some answers. In a series of studies, we have found that leaders who promote social and environmental issues are more likely to have: - environmental experience (whether personal or professional) - training in business rather than law, and - exposure to shifting trends in society. Looking for these qualities in managers’ backgrounds can help us identify leaders who will commit to sustainability agendas. More add_circle What makes a good sustainability leader?

Research has shown that evaluating certain individual traits can help identify the leaders of tomorrow who will have the tools to address the serious sustainability challenges businesses face today.

IN: Journal of Business Ethics, 2017 Judith Walls, P. Berrone Journal paper We theoretically discuss and empirically show how CEO power based on environmental expertise and formal influence over executives and directors, in the absence and presence of shareholder activism, spurs firms toward greener strategies. Our results support the idea that CEOs with informal power, grounded in expertise, reduce corporate environmental impact and this relationship is amplified when the CEO also enjoys formal power over the board of directors. Additionally, we found that any source of CEO power, whether informal or formal, is a good catalyst for transforming shareholder activism into corporate greening. However, in the absence of such activism, only CEOs’ informal environmental expert power acts as a determinant of firm environmental performance.

Journal of Cleaner Production, 140, 167-178. get_appDror Etzion, Joel Gehman, Fabrizio Ferraro, Miron Avidan Journal paper Shifting to dramatically more sustainable systems is an unconventional or wicked problem, encompassing multiple actors, disciplines, and values. Yet to date, sustainability initiatives have been tackled primarily by means of conventional managerial approaches. We contend that these approaches are ill suited for achieving sustainability transformations. We propose an alternative approach founded upon the sociological concept of robust action. In robust action, leaders embrace ambiguity (rather than striving for clarity), focus on short-term accomplishments (rather than long-term goals), and are satisfied with oblique movement (rather than linear progress). We elaborate on three robust strategies: participatory architecture, multi-vocal inscription and distributed experimentation and investigate their effectiveness in three sustainability related contexts: wind power, sustainability reporting and microcredit. We conclude by discussing the applicability of robust action to other contexts, and the complementarities between robust action and other forms of leadership towards sustainability. More add_circle How corporate governance affects corporate sustainability and why it matters Judith Walls, Pascual Berrone Newspaper Most often, corporate governance is thought of as a mechanism put in place to protect shareholder wealth from the claws of opportunistic managers. In this sense, the term corporate governance typically arises alongside phrases such as investor myopia, short-term goals, incentive alignment, financial crisis, and even corporate misconduct and accounting fraud.

A team of IWÖ researchers led by Martina Rothenberger and Rolf Wüstenhagen took a closer look at the recent referendum against Switzerland’s revised CO2 law. Their particular focus was on the influence of emotional dynamics on the perception of costs and benefits of climate policy. Contrary to high initial approval rates, the revision of the CO2 law was rejected by 51.6 % of voters on June 13, 2021. How did this opinion swing come about, and what can be learned for designing energy and climate policies that are contested in a referendum campaign? Based on a representative survey of Swiss voters (N=757), the researchers suggest that negative emotions currently prevail, whereas motivating voters for climate policy measures requires taking a closer look at co-benefits such as health, energy independence or the pleasure of low-carbon travel. Furthermore, a majority of voters overestimated the cost of the planned aviation tax, and were unaware of the financial benefits of redistribution of CO2 taxes.

It focuses on long term transformative change, science policy and innovation across different sectors, societies and structures. It was one of the first interdisciplinary research centres in the field of science and technology policy and at the forefront of the development of innovation as an academic discipline. Alongside internationally renowned research, SPRU also offers a range of MSc courses, as well as PhD research degrees. SPRU's research today addresses pressing global policy agendas, including the future of industrial policy, inclusive economic growth; the politics of scientific expertise, energy policy, security issues, entrepreneurship, and pathways to a more sustainable future. It aims to tackle real-world questions whilst also contributing to theoretical knowledge on innovation.[1] In 2018, SPRU ranked 3rd in the world and 1st in the UK for top science and technology think tanks on the Global Go ToThink Tank Index Report which was put together by the University of Pennsylvania.[2] SPRU has 60 plus faculty members and more than 150 MSc and 50 doctoral students. With an extensive global alumni network among senior science and technology policy makers, SPRU is committed to engagement and generating impact at all stages of research. Members of SPRU work closely with government and parliament, think tanks, media, business and the third sector, and are experienced in disseminating and applying their latest research findings. Contents 1 Organization 2 History 3 Current research priorities 4 Studying at SPRU/Teaching 5 Harvard Sussex Program 6 References 7 External links Organization[edit] The Science Policy Research Unit is located within the University of Sussex Business School in Brighton, UK. SPRU's current director is Professor Jeremy Hall, formerly director of the Centre for Social Innovation Management at Surrey Business School and editor-in-chief of the Journal of Engineering and Technology Management. He took over from Professor Johan Schot in September 2019. The Jubilee Building, where SPRU is currently based SPRU is also home to a number of specialist research centres including: Sussex Energy Group (SEG) Sussex Sustainability Research Programme (SSRP) The STEPS Centre (Co-hosted with the Institute of Development Studies) Harvard Sussex Program (a long-standing partnership with Harvard University in the field of biological and chemical weapons) Creative Industries Policy and Evidence Centre (in partnership with Nesta) Centre for Research into Energy Demand Solutions – Digital Society strand National Centre for Energy Systems Integration (in partnership with four other research-intensive universities and strategic partner Siemens) Transformative Innovation Policy Consortium (TIPC) History[edit] SPRU was founded in 1966 by Professor Christopher Freeman, a pioneer of what is known as innovation studies today. Professor Freeman ‘embraced an ‘economics of hope’ which embodied a positive view of our potential to direct innovation, creativity and new technologies towards more sustainable and inclusive futures’.[3] Since its foundation SPRU has had (and continues to have) a long list of highly regarded scholars among its faculty including Daniele Archibugi, Giovanni Dosi, Marie Jahoda, Carlota Perez, Keith Pavitt, Mary Kaldor, Richard R. Nelson, Giorgio Sirilli and Luc Soete. Current faculty members include Benjamin Sovacool, director of the Sussex Energy Group and advisor on energy to the European Commission's Directorate General for Research and Innovation; Andy Stirling, deputy director of the Sustainable Lifestyles Research Group; Caitriona McLeish, co-director of the Harvard Sussex Program on Chemical and Biological Weapons; Gordon MacKerron, former director of SPRU; Maria Savona, editor for Research Policy and the Journal of Evolutionary Economics; Paul Nightingale, director of strategy and operations for the Economic & Social Research Council; Erik Millstone, co-author of The Atlas of Food; and Ben Martin, editor of Research Policy and Associate Fellow of Cambridge's Centre for Science and Policy. Current research priorities[edit] SPRU research activities are extremely diverse, and are grouped into five main research themes: 1, Science, Politics and Decision Making: Researchers at SPRU apply a deep historical understanding to how the choices made about science and technology shape our societies. They also work on the politics of expertise, and on issues of foresight, research assessment, metrics and impact in today's research environment. 2, Energy: SPRU is part of the Sussex Energy Group, one of the largest independent social science energy policy research groups in the world. Researchers at SPRU seek to understand and encourage transitions to sustainable, low carbon energy systems. 3, Sustainable Development: Since the 1970s SPRU has been at the heart of international debates about the role of science, technology and innovation in fostering sustainable development around the world. SPRU's aim is to help organisations, industries and policy makers realize diverse pathways to sustainability. 4, Economics of Innovation: Researchers at SPRU seek to understand the structure and dynamics of innovating firms and industrial systems and how to manage innovation capabilities in firms, including research and technology change in high-tech industries and managing uncertainty in complex systems. 5, Innovation & Project Management: SPRU's work includes analysis of technology strategy, new technology based firms, complex systems and products, high-growth new ventures, as well as looking at innovation in different business models and sectors, including infrastructure, healthcare, biopharmaceuticals and services. Studying at SPRU/Teaching[edit] From technology policy and managing innovation, to fostering sustainability, international development and understanding complex energy systems, students at SPRU benefit from working at the frontier of new knowledge on some of today's most pressing global policy agendas. SPRU offers problem-led, rather than discipline-based teaching. SPRU currently offers six Masters courses, two of which are available for online distance learners. SPRU also offers two PhD degrees, in Science and Technology Policy Studies and Technology and Innovation Management. Harvard Sussex Program[edit] The Harvard Sussex Program (HSP) is a collaborative effort on chemical biological weapons disarmament between Harvard University and Science and Technology Policy Research (SPRU) at the University of Sussex. It was formed by Matthew Meselson and Julian Perry Robinson to provide research, training, seminars, and information work on chemical biological warfare and its disarmament. In 2010, Sussex faculty member Caitriona McLeish was appointed co-director of the HSP. The program is well known for its unique large archival collection of CBW related documents at Sussex (SHIB - Sussex Harvard Information Bank). HSP is an academic Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) that has influenced policy creation from within the United States and Great Britain on the formation of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) and reviews of the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC).

The federal constitutional monarchy consists of thirteen states and three federal territories, separated by the South China Sea into two regions, Peninsular Malaysia and Borneo's East Malaysia. Peninsular Malaysia shares a land and maritime border with Thailand and maritime borders with Singapore, Vietnam, and Indonesia. East Malaysia shares land and maritime borders with Brunei and Indonesia and a maritime border with the Philippines and Vietnam. Kuala Lumpur is the national capital, largest city and the seat of the legislative branch of the federal government. The nearby planned capital of Putrajaya is the administrative capital; which represents the seat of both the executive branch (Cabinet, federal ministries and agencies) and the judicial branch of the federal government. With a population of over 32 million, Malaysia is the world's 43rd-most populous country. The southernmost point of continental Eurasia is in Tanjung Piai. In the tropics, Malaysia is one of 17 megadiverse countries, home to a number of endemic species. Malaysia has its origins in the Malay kingdoms which, from the 18th century, became subject to the British Empire, along with the British Straits Settlements protectorate. Peninsular Malaysia was unified as the Malayan Union in 1946. Malaya was restructured as the Federation of Malaya in 1948 and achieved independence on 31 August 1957. The independent Malaya united with the then British crown colonies of North Borneo, Sarawak, and Singapore on 16 September 1963 to become Malaysia. In August 1965, Singapore was expelled from the federation and became a separate independent country.[13] The country is multi-ethnic and multi-cultural, which has a significant effect on its politics. About half the population is ethnically Malay, with minorities of Chinese, Indians, and indigenous peoples. The country's official language is Malaysian, a standard form of the Malay language. English remains an active second language. While recognising Islam as the country's established religion, the constitution grants freedom of religion to non-Muslims. The government is modelled on the Westminster parliamentary system and the legal system is based on common law. The head of state is an elected monarch, chosen from among the nine state sultans every five years. The head of government is the Prime Minister. After independence, the Malaysian GDP grew at an average of 6.5% per annum for almost 50 years. The economy has traditionally been fuelled by its natural resources but is expanding in the sectors of science, tourism, commerce and medical tourism. Malaysia has a newly industrialised market economy, ranked third-largest in Southeast Asia and 33rd-largest in the world.[14] It is a founding member of ASEAN, EAS, OIC and a member of APEC, the Commonwealth and the Non-Aligned Movement.

It may derive from the Sanskrit ""Himalaya"", referring to areas high in the mountains, or ""Malaiyur-pura"", meaning mountain town.[17] Another similar theory claims its origin lies in the Tamil words ""malai"" and ""ur"" meaning ""mountain"" and ""city, land"", respectively.[18][19][20] Another suggestion is that it derives from the Pamalayu campaign. A final suggestion is that it comes from a Javanese word meaning ""to run"", from which a river, the Sungai Melayu ('Melayu river'), was named due to its strong current.[17] Similar-sounding variants have also appeared in accounts older than the 11th century, as toponyms for areas in Sumatra or referring to a larger region around the Strait of Malacca.[21] The Sanskrit text Vayu Purana, thought to have been in existence since the first millennium CE, mentioned a land named 'Malayadvipa' which was identified by certain scholars as the modern Malay peninsula.[22][23][24][25][26] Other notable accounts are by the 2nd century Ptolemy's Geographia that used the name Malayu Kulon for the west coast of Golden Chersonese, and the 7th century Yijing's account of Malayu.[21] At some point, the Melayu Kingdom took its name from the Sungai Melayu.[17][27] 'Melayu' then became associated with Srivijaya,[21] and remained associated with various parts of Sumatra, especially Palembang, where the founder of the Malacca Sultanate is thought to have come from.[28] It is only thought to have developed into an ethnonym as Malacca became a regional power in the 15th century. Islamisation established an ethnoreligious identity in Malacca, with the term 'Melayu' beginning to appear as interchangeable with 'Melakans'. It may have specifically referred to local Malays speakers thought loyal to the Malaccan Sultan. The initial Portuguese use of Malayos reflected this, referring only to the ruling people of Malacca. The prominence of traders from Malacca led 'Melayu' to be associated with Muslim traders, and from there became associated with the wider cultural and linguistic group.[21] Malacca and later Johor claimed they were the centre of Malay culture, a position supported by the British which led to the term 'Malay' becoming more usually linked to the Malay peninsula rather than Sumatra.[28] Before the onset of European colonisation, the Malay Peninsula was known natively as ""Tanah Melayu"" (""Malay Land"").[29][30] Under a racial classification created by a German scholar Johann Friedrich Blumenbach, the natives of maritime Southeast Asia were grouped into a single category, the Malay race.[31][32] Following the expedition of French navigator Jules Dumont d'Urville to Oceania in 1826, he later proposed the terms of ""Malaysia"", ""Micronesia"" and ""Melanesia"" to the Société de Géographie in 1831, distinguishing these Pacific cultures and island groups from the existing term ""Polynesia"". Dumont d'Urville described Malaysia as ""an area commonly known as the East Indies"".[33] In 1850, the English ethnologist George Samuel Windsor Earl, writing in the Journal of the Indian Archipelago and Eastern Asia, proposed naming the islands of Southeast Asia as ""Melayunesia"" or ""Indunesia"", favouring the former.[34] The name Malaysia gained some use to label what is now the Malay Archipelago.[35] In modern terminology, ""Malay"" remains the name of an ethnoreligious group of Austronesian people predominantly inhabiting the Malay Peninsula and portions of the adjacent islands of Southeast Asia, including the east coast of Sumatra, the coast of Borneo, and smaller islands that lie between these areas.[36] The state that gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1957 took the name the ""Federation of Malaya"", chosen in preference to other potential names such as ""Langkasuka"", after the historic kingdom located at the upper section of the Malay Peninsula in the first millennium CE.[37][38] The name ""Malaysia"" was adopted in 1963 when the existing states of the Federation of Malaya, plus Singapore, North Borneo and Sarawak formed a new federation.[39] One theory posits the name was chosen so that ""si"" represented the inclusion of Singapore, North Borneo, and Sarawak to Malaya in 1963.[39] Politicians in the Philippines contemplated renaming their state ""Malaysia"" before the modern country took the name.[40] History Main article: History of Malaysia The Malacca Sultanate played a major role in spreading Islam throughout the Malay Archipelago. Evidence of modern human habitation in Malaysia dates back 40,000 years.[41] In the Malay Peninsula, the first inhabitants are thought to be Negritos.[42] Traders and settlers from India and China arrived as early as the first century AD, establishing trading ports and coastal towns in the second and third centuries. Their presence resulted in strong Indian and Chinese influences on the local cultures, and the people of the Malay Peninsula adopted the religions of Hinduism and Buddhism. Sanskrit inscriptions appear as early as the fourth or fifth century.[43] The Kingdom of Langkasuka arose around the second century in the northern area of the Malay Peninsula, lasting until about the 15th century.[37] Between the 7th and 13th centuries, much of the southern Malay Peninsula was part of the maritime Srivijayan empire. By the 13th and the 14th century, the Majapahit empire had successfully wrested control over most of the peninsula and the Malay Archipelago from Srivijaya.[44] Islam began to spread among Malays in the 14th century.[45] In the early 15th century, Parameswara, a runaway king of the former Kingdom of Singapura linked to the old Srivijayan court, founded the Malacca Sultanate. Malacca was an important commercial centre during this time, attracting trade from around the region. The Dutch fleet battling with the Portuguese armada as part of the Dutch–Portuguese War in 1606 to gain control of Malacca In 1511, Malacca was conquered by Portugal,[45] after which it was taken by the Dutch in 1641. In 1786, the British Empire established a presence in Malaya, when the Sultan of Kedah leased Penang Island to the British East India Company. The British obtained the town of Singapore in 1819,[46] and in 1824 took control of Malacca following the Anglo-Dutch Treaty. By 1826, the British directly controlled Penang, Malacca, Singapore, and the island of Labuan, which they established as the crown colony of the Straits Settlements. By the 20th century, the states of Pahang, Selangor, Perak, and Negeri Sembilan, known together as the Federated Malay States, had British residents appointed to advise the Malay rulers, to whom the rulers were bound to defer by treaty.[47] The remaining five states in the peninsula, known as the Unfederated Malay States, while not directly under British rule, also accepted British advisers around the turn of the 20th century. Development on the peninsula and Borneo were generally separate until the 19th century. Under British rule the immigration of Chinese and Indians to serve as labourers was encouraged.[48] The area that is now Sabah came under British control as North Borneo when both the Sultan of Brunei and the Sultan of Sulu transferred their respective territorial rights of ownership, between 1877 and 1878.[49] In 1842, Sarawak was ceded by the Sultan of Brunei to James Brooke, whose successors ruled as the White Rajahs over an independent kingdom until 1946, when it became a crown colony.[50] In the Second World War, the Japanese Army invaded and occupied Malaya, North Borneo, Sarawak, and Singapore for over three years. During this time, ethnic tensions were raised and nationalism grew.[51] Popular support for independence increased after Malaya was reconquered by Allied forces.[52] Post-war British plans to unite the administration of Malaya under a single crown colony called the ""Malayan Union"" met with strong opposition from the Malays, who opposed the weakening of the Malay rulers and the granting of citizenship to the ethnic Chinese. The Malayan Union, established in 1946, and consisting of all the British possessions in the Malay Peninsula with the exception of Singapore, was quickly dissolved and replaced on 1 February 1948 by the Federation of Malaya, which restored the autonomy of the rulers of the Malay states under British protection.[53] Statue of Francis Light in the Fort Cornwallis of Penang, the first British colony in what was to become Malaysia During this time, the mostly ethnically Chinese rebels under the leadership of the Malayan Communist Party launched guerrilla operations designed to force the British out of Malaya. The Malayan Emergency (1948–1960) involved a long anti-insurgency campaign by Commonwealth troops in Malaya.[54] On 31 August 1957, Malaya became an independent member of the Commonwealth of Nations.[55] After this a plan was put in place to federate Malaya with the crown colonies of North Borneo (which joined as Sabah), Sarawak, and Singapore. The date of federation was planned to be 31 August 1963 so as to coincide with the anniversary of Malayan independence; however, federation was delayed until 16 September 1963 in order for a United Nations survey of support for federation in Sabah and Sarawak, called for by parties opposed to federation including Indonesia's Sukarno and the Sarawak United Peoples' Party, to be completed.[56][57][58][59] Federation brought heightened tensions including a conflict with Indonesia as well continuous conflicts against the Communists in Borneo and the Malayan Peninsula which escalates to the Sarawak Communist Insurgency and Second Malayan Emergency together with several other issues such as the cross border attacks into North Borneo by Moro pirates from the southern islands of the Philippines, Singapore being expelled from the Federation in 1965,[60][61] and racial strife. This strife culminated in the 13 May race riots in 1969.[62] After the riots, the controversial New Economic Policy was launched by Prime Minister Tun Abdul Razak, trying to increase the share of the economy held by the bumiputera.[63] Under Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad there was a period of rapid economic growth and urbanisation beginning in the 1980s. The economy shifted from being agriculturally based to one based on manufacturing and industry. Numerous mega-projects were completed, such as the Petronas Towers, the North–South Expressway, the Multimedia Super Corridor, and the new federal administrative capital of Putrajaya.[39] However, in the late 1990s the Asian financial crisis almost caused the collapse of the currency and the stock and property markets, although they later recovered.[64] The 1MDB scandal was a major global corruption scandal that implicated then-Prime Minister Najib Razak in 2015.[65] The scandal contributed to the first change in ruling political party since independence in the 2018 general election.[66] In the 2020s, the country was gripped by political crisis that coincided with health and economic crises caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.[67] Government and politics Main articles: Politics of Malaysia and Government of Malaysia The Parliament of Malaysia, the building that houses the members of the Dewan Rakyat Malaysia is a federal constitutional elective monarchy; the only federal country in Southeast Asia.[68] The system of government is closely modelled on the Westminster parliamentary system, a legacy of British rule.[69] The head of state is the King, whose official title is the Yang di-Pertuan Agong. The King is elected to a five-year term by and from among the nine hereditary rulers of the Malay states. The other four states, which have titular Governors, do not participate in the selection. By informal agreement the position is rotated among the nine,[69] and has been held by Abdullah of Pahang since 31 January 2019.[70] The King's role has been largely ceremonial since changes to the constitution in 1994, picking ministers and members of the upper house.[71] Legislative power is divided between federal and state legislatures. The bicameral federal parliament consists of the lower house, the House of Representatives and the upper house, the Senate.[72] The 222-member House of Representatives is elected for a maximum term of five years from single-member constituencies. All 70 senators sit for three-year terms; 26 are elected by the 13 state assemblies, and the remaining 44 are appointed by the King upon the Prime Minister's recommendation.[45] The parliament follows a multi-party system and the government is elected through a first-past-the-post system.[45][73] Parliamentary elections are held at least once every five years,[45] the most recent of which took place in May 2018.[66] Before 2018, registered voters aged 21 and above could vote for the members of the House of Representatives and, in most of the states, for the state legislative chamber. Voting is not mandatory.[74] In July 2019, a bill to lower the voting age to 18 years old was officially passed.[75] Malaysia's ranking increased by 9 places in the 2019 Democracy Index to 43th compared to the previous year, and is classified as a 'flawed democracy'.[76] The Perdana Putra houses the office of the Prime Minsiter. Executive power is vested in the Cabinet, led by the Prime Minister. The prime minister must be a member of the House of Representatives, who in the opinion of His Majesty the King, commands the support of a majority of members. The Cabinet is chosen from members of both houses of Parliament.[45] The Prime Minister is both the head of cabinet and the head of government.[71] As a result of the 2018 general election Malaysia was governed by the Pakatan Harapan political alliance,[66] although Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad resigned amid a political crisis in 2020. In March 2020, the Perikatan Nasional coalition formed under Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin,[77] before Muhyidden lost majority support and was replaced by deputy Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob, a veteran politician from UMNO, in August 2021.[78][79] Malaysia's legal system is based on English Common Law.[45] Although the judiciary is theoretically independent, its independence has been called into question and the appointment of judges lacks accountability and transparency.[80] The highest court in the judicial system is the Federal Court, followed by the Court of Appeal and two high courts, one for Peninsular Malaysia and one for East Malaysia. Malaysia also has a special court to hear cases brought by or against royalty.[81] The death penalty is in use for serious crimes such as murder, terrorism, drug trafficking, and kidnapping.[82][83] Separate from and running parallel to the civil courts[84] are the Syariah Courts, which apply Shariah law to Muslims[85] in the areas of family law and religious observances. Homosexuality is illegal in Malaysia,[86][87] and the authorities can impose punishment such as caning.[88] Human trafficking and sex trafficking in Malaysia are significant problems.[89][90] Race is a significant force in politics.[45] Affirmative actions such as the New Economic Policy[63] and the National Development Policy which superseded it, were implemented to advance the standing of the bumiputera, consisting of Malays and the indigenous tribes who are considered the original inhabitants of Malaysia, over non-bumiputera such as Malaysian Chinese and Malaysian Indians.[91] These policies provide preferential treatment to bumiputera in employment, education, scholarships, business, and access to cheaper housing and assisted savings. However, it has generated greater interethnic resentment.[92] There is ongoing debate over whether the laws and society of Malaysia should reflect secular or Islamic principles.[93] Islamic criminal laws passed by the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party with the support of United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) state assemblymen in the state legislative assembly of Kelantan have been blocked by the federal government on the basis that criminal laws are the responsibility of the federal government.[94][95][96] Malaysia's ranking in the 2020 Press Freedom Index increased by 22 places to 101st compared to the previous year, making it one of two countries in Southeast Asia without a 'Difficult situation' or 'Very Serious situation' with regards to press freedom.[97] However, it fell 18 places the following year due to the policies of the Perikatan Nasional government.[98] Malaysia is marked in the 50–59 range according to the 2019 Corruption Perceptions Index, indicating a moderate level of corruption. Freedom House noted Malaysia as ""partly free"" in its 2018 survey.[99] A lawsuit filed by Department of Justice (DOJ), alleged that at least $3.5 billion has been stolen from Malaysia's 1MDB state-owned fund.[65][100][101] On 28 July 2020, former Prime Minister Najib Razak was found guilty on seven charges in the 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal.[102] He was sentenced to 12 years in prison.[103] Administrative divisions Main articles: States and federal territories of Malaysia, Divisions of Malaysia, and Districts of Malaysia Perlis Kedah Penang Kelantan Terengganu Perak Selangor Negeri Sembilan Melaka Johor Pahang Sarawak Sabah Labuan Kuala Lumpur Putrajaya West Malaysia East Malaysia (Blue) States (Red) Federal Territories South China Sea Strait of Malacca Gulf of Thailand Sulu Sea Celebes Sea Brunei Indonesia Indonesia Indonesia Philippines Singapore Thailand Malaysia is a federation of 13 states and three federal territories.[104] These are divided between two regions, with 11 states and two federal territories on Peninsular Malaysia and the other two states and one federal territory in East Malaysia. Each state is divided into districts, which are then divided into mukim. In Sabah and Sarawak districts are grouped into divisions.[105] Governance of the states is divided between the federal and the state governments, with different powers reserved for each, and the Federal government has direct administration of the federal territories.[106] Each state has a unicameral State Legislative Assembly whose members are elected from single-member constituencies. State governments are led by Chief Ministers,[45] who are state assembly members from the majority party in the assembly. In each of the states with a hereditary ruler, the Chief Minister is normally required to be a Malay, appointed by the ruler upon the recommendation of the Prime Minister.[107] Except for state elections in Sarawak, by convention state elections are held concurrently with the federal election.[71] Lower-level administration is carried out by local authorities, which include city councils, district councils, and municipal councils, although autonomous statutory bodies can be created by the federal and state governments to deal with certain tasks.[108] The federal constitution puts local authorities outside of the federal territories under the exclusive jurisdictions of the state government,[109] although in practice the federal government has intervened in the affairs of state local governments.[110] There are 154 local authorities, consisting of 14 city councils, 38 municipal councils, and 97 district councils. The 13 states are based on historical Malay kingdoms, and 9 of the 11 Peninsular states, known as the Malay states, retain their royal families. The King is elected by and from the nine rulers to serve a five-year term.[45] This King appoints governors serving a four-year term for the states without monarchies, after consultations with the chief minister of that state. Each state has its own written constitution.[111] Sabah and Sarawak have considerably more autonomy than the other states, most notably having separate immigration policies and controls, and a unique residency status.[112][113][114] Federal intervention in state affairs, lack of development, and disputes over oil royalties have occasionally led to statements about secession from leaders in several states such as Penang, Johor, Kelantan, Sabah and Sarawak, although these have not been followed up and no serious independence movements exist.[115][116][117][118] States A list of thirteen states and each state capital (in brackets): Johor (Johor Bahru) Kedah (Alor Setar) Kelantan (Kota Bharu) Malacca (Malacca City) Negeri Sembilan (Seremban) Pahang (Kuantan) Penang (George Town) Perak (Ipoh) Perlis (Kangar) Sabah (Kota Kinabalu) Sarawak (Kuching) Selangor (Shah Alam) Terengganu (Kuala Terengganu) Federal Territories Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur Federal Territory of Labuan Federal Territory of Putrajaya Foreign relations and military Main articles: Foreign relations of Malaysia and Malaysian Armed Forces Former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad meeting with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at the Prime Minister's Office in Putrajaya, 2018 A founding member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)[119] and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC),[120] the country participates in many international organisations such as the United Nations,[121] the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation,[122] the Developing 8 Countries,[123] and the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM).[124] It has chaired ASEAN, the OIC, and the NAM in the past.[45] A former British colony, it is also a member of the Commonwealth of Nations.[125] Kuala Lumpur was the site of the first East Asia Summit in 2005.[126] Malaysia's foreign policy is officially based on the principle of neutrality and maintaining peaceful relations with all countries, regardless of their political system.[127] The government attaches a high priority to the security and stability of Southeast Asia,[126] and seeks to further develop relations with other countries in the region. Historically the government has tried to portray Malaysia as a progressive Islamic nation[127] while strengthening relations with other Islamic states.[126] A strong tenet of Malaysia's policy is national sovereignty and the right of a country to control its domestic affairs.[71] Malaysia signed the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.[128][129] The Spratly Islands are disputed by many states in the area, and a large portion of the South China Sea is claimed by China. Unlike its neighbours of Vietnam and the Philippines, Malaysia historically avoided conflicts with China.[130] However, after the encroachment of Chinese ships in Malaysian territorial waters,[131] Malaysia has become active in condemning China.[132][133] Brunei and Malaysia in 2009 announced an end to claims of each other's land, and committed to resolve issues related to their maritime borders.[134] The Philippines has a dormant claim to the eastern part of Sabah.[135] Singapore's land reclamation has caused tensions,[136] and minor maritime and land border disputes exist with Indonesia.[135][137] Malaysia has never recognised Israel and has no diplomatic ties with it,[138] and has called for the International Criminal Court to take action against Israel over its Gaza flotilla raid.[139] Malaysia has stated it will establish official relations with Israel only when a peace agreement with the State of Palestine has been reached, and called for both parties to find a quick resolution to realise the two-state solution.[138][140][141][142] Malaysian peacekeeping forces have contributed to many UN peacekeeping missions, such as in Congo, Iran–Iraq, Namibia, Cambodia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Somalia, Kosovo, East Timor and Lebanon.[45][143] Examples of the Malaysian Armed Forces weaponry assets. Clockwise from top right: Scorpène-class submarine, PT-91M MBT tank, Malaysian Army paratrooper with M4, and Su-30MKM fighter aircraft. The Malaysian Armed Forces have three branches: the Royal Malaysian Navy, the Malaysian Army, and the Royal Malaysian Air Force. There is no conscription, and the required age for voluntary military service is 18. The military uses 1.5% of the country's GDP, and employs 1.23% of Malaysia's manpower.[144] The Five Power Defence Arrangements is a regional security initiative which has been in place for almost 40 years. It involves joint military exercises held among Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.[145] Joint exercises and war games have also been held with Brunei,[146] China,[147] India,[148] Indonesia[149] Japan[150] and the United States.[151] Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam have agreed to host joint security force exercises to secure their maritime border and tackle issues such as illegal immigration, piracy and smuggling.[152][153][154] Previously there were fears that extremist militants activities in the Muslim areas of the southern Philippines[155] and southern Thailand[156] would spill over into Malaysia. Because of this, Malaysia began to increase its border security.[155] Geography Main article: Geography of Malaysia Malaysia is within the equatorial region, where a tropical rainforest climate is apparent all year round. Malaysia is the 66th largest country by total land area, with a land area of 329,613 km2 (127,264 sq mi). It has land borders with Thailand in West Malaysia, and Indonesia and Brunei in East Malaysia.[157] It is linked to Singapore by a narrow causeway and a bridge. The country also has maritime boundaries with Vietnam[158] and the Philippines.[159] The land borders are defined in large part by geological features such as the Perlis River, the Golok River and the Pagalayan Canal, whilst some of the maritime boundaries are the subject of ongoing contention.[157] Brunei forms what is almost an enclave in Malaysia,[160] with the state of Sarawak dividing it into two parts. Malaysia is the only country with territory on both the Asian mainland and the Malay archipelago.[161] Tanjung Piai, located in the southern state of Johor, is the southernmost tip of continental Asia.[162] The Strait of Malacca, lying between Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia, is one of the most important thoroughfares in global commerce, carrying 40 per cent of the world's trade.[163] The two parts of Malaysia, separated from each other by the South China Sea, share a largely similar landscape in that both Peninsular and East Malaysia feature coastal plains rising to hills and mountains.[157] Peninsular Malaysia, containing 40 per cent of Malaysia's land area,[161] extends 740 km (460 mi) from north to south, and its maximum width is 322 km (200 mi).[164] It is divided between its east and west coasts by the Titiwangsa Mountains,[165] rising to a peak elevation of 2,183 metres (7,162 ft) at Mount Korbu,[166] part of a series of mountain ranges running down the centre of the peninsula.[161] These mountains are heavily forested,[167] and mainly composed of granite and other igneous rocks. Much of it has been eroded, creating a karst landscape.[161] The range is the origin of some of Peninsular Malaysia's river systems.[167] The coastal plains surrounding the peninsula reach a maximum width of 50 kilometres (31 mi), and the peninsula's coastline is nearly 1,931 km (1,200 mi) long, although harbours are only available on the western side.[164] Mount Kinabalu, the highest summit in the country East Malaysia, on the island of Borneo, has a coastline of 2,607 km (1,620 mi).[157] It is divided between coastal regions, hills and valleys, and a mountainous interior.[161] The Crocker Range extends northwards from Sarawak,[161] dividing the state of Sabah. It is the location of the 4,095 m (13,435 ft) high Mount Kinabalu,[168][169] the tallest mountain in Malaysia. Mount Kinabalu is located in the Kinabalu National Park, which is protected as one of the four UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Malaysia.[170] The highest mountain ranges form the border between Malaysia and Indonesia. Sarawak contains the Mulu Caves, the largest cave system in the world, in the Gunung Mulu National Park which is also a World Heritage Site.[161] Around these two halves of Malaysia are numerous islands, the largest of which is Banggi.[171] The local climate is equatorial and characterised by the annual southwest (April to October) and northeast (October to February) monsoons.[164] The temperature is moderated by the presence of the surrounding oceans.[161] Humidity is usually high, and the average annual rainfall is 250 cm (98 in).[164] The climates of the Peninsula and the East differ, as the climate on the peninsula is directly affected by wind from the mainland, as opposed to the more maritime weather of the East. Local climates can be divided into three regions, highland, lowland, and coastal. Climate change is likely to affect sea levels and rainfall, increasing flood risks and leading to droughts.[161] Biodiversity and conservation Main articles: Wildlife of Malaysia, Environmental issues in Malaysia, and List of national parks in Malaysia Native species in Malaysia, clockwise from top-right: oriental pied hornbills, hawksbill sea turtle, proboscis monkey, Malayan tiger. Malaysia signed the Rio Convention on Biological Diversity on 12 June 1993, and became a party to the convention on 24 June 1994.[172] It has subsequently produced a National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, which was received by the convention on 16 April 1998.[173] The country is megadiverse with a high number of species and high levels of endemism.[174] It is estimated to contain 20 per cent of the world's animal species.[175] High levels of endemism are found on the diverse forests of Borneo's mountains, as species are isolated from each other by lowland forest.[161] There are about 210 mammal species in the country.[168] Over 620 species of birds have been recorded in Peninsular Malaysia,[175] with many endemic to the mountains there. A high number of endemic bird species are also found in Malaysian Borneo.[161] 250 reptile species have been recorded in the country, with about 150 species of snakes[176] and 80 species of lizards.[168] There are about 150 species of frogs,[168] and thousands of insect species.[168] The Exclusive economic zone of Malaysia is 334,671 km2 (129,217 sq mi) and 1.5 times larger than its land area. It is mainly in the South China Sea.[177][178] Some of its waters are in the Coral Triangle, a biodiversity hotspot.[179] The waters around Sipadan island are the most biodiverse in the world.[175] Bordering East Malaysia, the Sulu Sea is a biodiversity hotspot, with around 600 coral species and 1200 fish species.[180] The unique biodiversity of Malaysian Caves always attracts lovers of ecotourism from all over the world.[181] Nearly 4,000 species of fungi, including lichen-forming species have been recorded from Malaysia. Of the two fungal groups with the largest number of species in Malaysia, the Ascomycota and their asexual states have been surveyed in some habitats (decaying wood, marine and freshwater ecosystems, as parasites of some plants, and as agents of biodegradation), but have not been or have been only poorly surveyed in other habitats (as endobionts, in soils, on dung, as human and animal pathogens); the Basidiomycota are only partly surveyed: bracket fungi, and mushrooms and toadstools have been studied, but Malaysian rust and smut fungi remain very poorly known. Without doubt, many more fungal species in Malaysia have not yet been recorded, and it is likely that many of those, when found, will be new to science.[182] Some species of Rafflesia can grow up to 1 m (3 ft 3 in) in diameter, making them the largest flowers in the world. About two thirds of Malaysia was covered in forest as of 2007,[164] with some forests believed to be 130 million years old.[168] The forests are dominated by dipterocarps.[183] Lowland forest covers areas below 760 m (2,490 ft),[164] and formerly East Malaysia was covered in such rainforest,[183] which is supported by its hot wet climate.[161] There are around 14,500 species of flowering plants and trees.[168] Besides rainforests, there are over 1,425 km2 (550 sq mi) of mangroves in Malaysia,[164] and a large amount of peat forest. At higher altitudes, oaks, chestnuts, and rhododendrons replace dipterocarps.[161] There are an estimated 8,500 species of vascular plants in Peninsular Malaysia, with another 15,000 in the East.[184] The forests of East Malaysia are estimated to be the habitat of around 2,000 tree species, and are one of the most biodiverse areas in the world, with 240 different species of trees every hectare.[161] These forests host many members of the Rafflesia genus, the largest flowers in the world,[183] with a maximum diameter of 1 m (3 ft 3 in).[185] Logging, along with cultivation practices has devastated tree cover, causing severe environmental degradation in the country. Over 80 per cent of Sarawak's rainforest has been logged.[161] Floods in East Malaysia have been worsened by the loss of trees, and over 60 per cent of the Peninsula's forest have been cleared.[185] With current rates of deforestation, mainly for the palm oil industry, the forests are predicted to be extinct by 2020.[161][186] Deforestation is a major problem for animals, fungi and plants, having caused species such as Begonia eiromischa to go extinct.[187] Most remaining forest is found inside reserves and national parks.[185] Habitat destruction has proved a threat for marine life.[180] Illegal fishing is another major threat,[180] with fishing methods such as dynamite fishing and poisoning depleting marine ecosystems.[188] Leatherback turtle numbers have dropped 98 per cent since the 1950s.[176] Hunting has also been an issue for some animals,[185] with overconsumption and the use of animal parts for profit endangering many animals, from marine life[180] to tigers.[187] Marine life is also detrimentally affected by uncontrolled tourism.[189] The Malaysian government aims to balance economic growth with environmental protection, but has been accused of favouring big business over the environment.[185] Some state governments are now trying to counter the environmental impact and pollution created by deforestation;[183] and the federal government is trying to cut logging by 10 per cent each year. 28 national parks have been established; 23 in East Malaysia and five in the Peninsular.[185] Tourism has been limited in biodiverse areas such as Sipadan island.[189] Animal trafficking is a large issue, and the Malaysian government is holding talks with the governments of Brunei and Indonesia to standardise anti-trafficking laws.[190] Economy Main article: Economy of Malaysia A proportional representation of Malaysia exports, 2019 The Proton company is a Malaysian car manufacturer. Malaysia is a relatively open state-oriented and newly industrialised market economy.[191][192] The state plays a significant but declining role in guiding economic activity through macroeconomic plans. Malaysia has had one of the best economic records in Asia, with GDP growing an average 6.5 per cent annually from 1957 to 2005.[45] Malaysia's economy in 2014–2015 was one of the most competitive in Asia, ranking 6th in Asia and 20th in the world, higher than countries like Australia, France and South Korea.[193] In 2014, Malaysia's economy grew 6%, the second highest growth in ASEAN behind the Philippines' growth of 6.1%.[194] The economy of Malaysia in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) at purchasing power parity (PPP) in April 2019 was estimated to be $999.397 billion, the third largest in ASEAN and the 25th largest in the world.[195] In 1991, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad (during his first period as Prime Minister) outlined his ideal in Vision 2020, in which Malaysia would become a self-sufficient industrialised nation by 2020.[196] Najib Razak has said Malaysia could attain developed country status much earlier from the actual target in 2020, adding the country has two program concept such as Government Transformation Programme and the Economic Transformation Programme.[197] According to a HSBC report, Malaysia will become the world's 21st largest economy by 2050, with a GDP of $1.2 trillion (Year 2000 dollars) and a GDP per capita of $29,247 (Year 2000 dollars). The report also says ""The electronic equipment, petroleum, and liquefied natural gas producer will see a substantial increase in income per capita. Malaysian life expectancy, relatively high level of schooling, and above average fertility rate will help in its rapid expansion"".[198] Viktor Shvets, the managing director of Credit Suisse, has said ""Malaysia has all the right ingredients to become a developed nation"".[199] In the 1970s, the predominantly mining and agricultural-based economy began a transition towards a more multi-sector economy. Since the 1980s, the industrial sector, with a high level of investment, has led the country's growth.[45][200] The economy recovered from the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis earlier than neighbouring countries did, and has since recovered to the levels of the pre-crisis era with a GDP per capita of $14,800.[201][202] Economic inequalities exist between different ethnic groups. The Chinese make up about one-quarter of the population, but accounts for 70 per cent of the country's market capitalisation.[203] Chinese businesses in Malaysia are part of the larger bamboo network, a network of overseas Chinese businesses in the Southeast Asian market sharing common family and cultural ties.[204] International trade, facilitated by the shipping route in adjacent Strait of Malacca, and manufacturing are the key sectors.[205][206][207] Malaysia is an exporter of natural and agricultural resources, and petroleum is a major export.[45] Malaysia has once been the largest producer of tin,[208] rubber and palm oil in the world. Manufacturing has a large influence in the country's economy,[209] although Malaysia's economic structure has been moving away from it.[210] Malaysia remains one of the world's largest producers of palm oil.[211] The Petronas Towers, the headquarters of the national oil company Petronas and are the tallest twin-towers in the world. In an effort to diversify the economy and make it less dependent on export goods, the government has pushed to increase tourism to Malaysia. As a result, tourism has become Malaysia's third largest source of foreign exchange, although it is threatened by the negative effects of the growing industrial economy, with large amounts of air and water pollution along with deforestation affecting tourism.[212] The tourism sector came under some pressure in 2014 when the national carrier Malaysia Airlines had one of its planes disappear in March, while another was brought down by a missile over Ukraine in July, resulting in the loss of a total 537 passengers and crew. The state of the airline, which had been unprofitable for 3 years, prompted the government in August 2014 to nationalise the airline by buying up the 30 per cent it did not already own.[213] Between 2013 and 2014, Malaysia has been listed as one of the best places to retire to in the world, with the country in third position on the Global Retirement Index.[214][215] This in part was the result of the Malaysia My Second Home programme to allow foreigners to live in the country on a long-stay visa for up to 10 years.[216] In 2016, Malaysia ranked the fifth position on The World's Best Retirement Havens while getting in the first place as the best place in Asia to retire. A warm climate combined with a British colonial background makes it easy for foreigners to interact with locals.[217] The country has developed into a centre of Islamic banking, and is the country with the highest numbers of female workers in that industry.[218] Knowledge-based services are also expanding.[210] To create a self-reliant defensive ability and support national development, Malaysia privatised some of its military facilities in the 1970s. The privatisation has created defence industry, which in 1999 was brought under the Malaysia Defence Industry Council. The government continues to promote this sector and its competitiveness, actively marketing the defence industry.[219] The country is one of the world's largest exporters of semiconductor devices, electrical devices, and IT and communication products.[45] Malaysia began developing its own space programme in 2002,[220][221] and in 2006, Russia agreed to transport one Malaysian to the International Space Station as part of a multibillion-dollar purchase of 18 Russian Sukhoi Su-30MKM fighter jets by the Royal Malaysian Air Force.[222] The government has invested in building satellites through the RazakSAT programme.[223] Infrastructure See also: Transport in Malaysia Malaysia's persistent drive to develop and upgrade its infrastructure has resulted in one of the most well-developed infrastructure among the newly industrializing countries of Asia. In 2014, Malaysia ranked 8th in Asia and 25th in the world in term of overall infrastructure development.[224] The country's telecommunications network is second only to Singapore's in Southeast Asia, with 4.7 million fixed-line subscribers and more than 30 million cellular subscribers.[225][226] The country has seven international ports, the major one being the Port Klang. There are 200 industrial parks along with specialised parks such as Technology Park Malaysia and Kulim Hi-Tech Park.[227] Fresh water is available to over 95 per cent of the population with ground water accounts for 90 percent of the freshwater resources.[228][229] During the colonial period, development was mainly concentrated in economically powerful cities and in areas forming security concerns. Although rural areas have been the focus of great development, they still lag behind areas such as the West Coast of Peninsular Malaysia.[230] The telecommunication network, although strong in urban areas, is less available to the rural population.[225] Malaysia's energy infrastructure sector is largely dominated by Tenaga Nasional, the largest electric utility company in Southeast Asia, with over RM99.03 billion of assets. Customers are connected to electricity through the National Grid, with more than 420 transmission substations in the Peninsular linked together by approximately 11,000 km of transmission lines operating at 66, 132, 275, and 500 kilovolts.[231] The other two electric utility companies in the country are Sarawak Energy and Sabah Electricity.[232] In 2013, Malaysia's total power generation capacity was over 29,728 megawatts. Total electricity generation was 140,985.01 GWh and total electricity consumption was 116,087.51 GWh.[233] Energy production in Malaysia is largely based on oil and natural gas, owing to Malaysia's oil reserves and natural gas reserves, which is the fourth largest in Asia-Pacific region.[234] Transportation in Malaysia. Clockwise from top: North–South Expressway, KTM ETS Class 91 (left) and KTM Komuter Class 92 (right) and the Kuala Lumpur International Airport. Malaysia's road network is one of the most comprehensive in Asia and covers a total of 144,403 kilometres (89,728 mi). The main national road network is the Malaysian Federal Roads System, which span over 49,935 km (31,028 mi). Most of the federal roads in Malaysia are 2-lane roads. In town areas, federal roads may become 4-lane roads to increase traffic capacity. Nearly all federal roads are paved with tarmac except for parts of the Skudai–Pontian Highway which are paved with concrete, while parts of the Federal Highway linking Klang to Kuala Lumpur are paved with asphalt. Malaysia has over 1,798 kilometres (1,117 mi) of highways and the longest highway, the North–South Expressway, extends over 800 kilometres (497 mi) on the West Coast of Peninsular Malaysia, connecting major urban centres like Kuala Lumpur, Penang and Johor Bahru. In 2015, the government announced a RM27 billion (US$8.23 billion) Pan-Borneo Highway project to upgrade all trunk roads to dual-carriageway expressways, bringing the standard of East Malaysian highways to the same level of quality as Peninsular highways.[235][236] There are currently 1,833 kilometres (1,139 mi) of railways in Malaysia, of which 767 km (477 mi) are double tracked and electrified. Rail transport in Malaysia comprises heavy rail (KTM), light rapid transit and monorail (Rapid Rail), and a funicular railway line (Penang Hill Railway). Heavy rail is mostly used for intercity passenger and freight transport as well as some urban public transport, while LRTs are used for intra-city urban public transport. There are two commuter rail services linking Kuala Lumpur with the Kuala Lumpur International Airport. The sole monorail line in the country is used for public transport in Kuala Lumpur, while the only funicular railway line is in Penang. A rapid transit project, the KVMRT, is currently under construction to improve Kuala Lumpur's public transport system. The railway network covers most of the 11 states in Peninsular Malaysia. In East Malaysia, only the state of Sabah has railways. The network is also connected to the Thai railway 1,000 mm (3 ft 3+3⁄8 in) network in the north. If the Burma Railway is rebuilt, services to Myanmar, India, and China could be initiated. Malaysia also operated the KTM ETS, (commercially known as ""ETS"", short for 'Electric Train Service') an inter-city rail passenger service operated by Keretapi Tanah Melayu Berhad using electric multiple-unit trains. The KTM ETS is the second electric train service to be operated by the Malaysian railway company, after the KTM Komuter service. The line length is 755 km (Padang Besar – Gemas) and additional 197 km from Gemas to Johor Bahru Sentral which is under construction. Malaysia has 118 airports, of which 38 are paved. The national airline is Malaysia Airlines, providing international and domestic air services. Major international routes and domestic routes crossing between Peninsula Malaysia and East Malaysia are served by Malaysia Airlines, AirAsia and Malindo Air while smaller domestic routes are supplemented by smaller airlines like MASwings, Firefly and Berjaya Air. Major cargo airlines include MASkargo and Transmile Air Services. Kuala Lumpur International Airport is the main and busiest airport of Malaysia. In 2014, it was the world's 13th busiest airport by international passenger traffic, recording over 25.4 million international passenger traffic. It was also the world's 20th busiest airport by passenger traffic, recording over 48.9 million passengers. Other major airports include Kota Kinabalu International Airport, which is also Malaysia's second busiest airport and busiest airport in East Malaysia with over 6.9 million passengers in 2013, and Penang International Airport, which serves Malaysia's second largest urban area, with over 5.4 million passengers in 2013. Demographics Main article: Demographics of Malaysia Population pyramid 2016 According to the Malaysian Department of Statistics, the country's population was 28,334,135 in 2010,[9] making it the 42nd most populated country. According to a 2012 estimate, the population is increasing by 1.54 percent per year. Malaysia has an average population density of 96 people per km2, ranking it 116th in the world for population density. People within the 15–64 age group constitute 69.5 percent of the total population; the 0–14 age group corresponds to 24.5 percent; while senior citizens aged 65 years or older make up 6.0 percent. In 1960, when the first official census was recorded in Malaysia, the population was 8.11 million. 91.8 per cent of the population are Malaysian citizens.[237] Malaysian citizens are divided along local ethnic lines, with 69.7 per cent considered bumiputera.[238] The largest group of bumiputera are Malays, who are defined in the constitution as Muslims who practice Malay customs and culture. They play a dominant role politically.[239] Bumiputera status is also accorded to the non-Malay indigenous groups of Sabah and Sarawak: which includes Dayaks (Iban, Bidayuh, Orang Ulu), Kadazan-Dusun, Melanau, Bajau and others. Non-Malay bumiputeras make up more than half of Sarawak's population and over two thirds of Sabah's population.[240][241] There are also indigenous or aboriginal groups in much smaller numbers on the peninsular, where they are collectively known as the Orang Asli.[242] Laws over who gets bumiputera status vary between states.[243] The percentage distribution of Malaysian population by ethnic group based on 2010 census There are also two other non-Bumiputera local ethnic groups. 22.5 per cent of the population are Malaysian Chinese, while 6.8 per cent are Malaysian Indian.[238] The local Chinese have historically been more dominant in the business community. Local Indian are majority of Tamil descent.[244][245] Malaysian citizenship is not automatically granted to those born in Malaysia, but is granted to a child born of two Malaysian parents outside Malaysia. Dual citizenship is not permitted.[246] Citizenship in the states of Sabah and Sarawak in Malaysian Borneo are distinct from citizenship in Peninsular Malaysia for immigration purposes. Every citizen is issued a biometric smart chip identity card known as MyKad at the age of 12, and must carry the card at all times.[247] The education system features a non-compulsory kindergarten education followed by six years of compulsory primary education, and five years of optional secondary education.[248] Schools in the primary education system are divided into two categories: national primary schools, which teach in Malay, and vernacular schools, which teach in Chinese or Tamil.[249] Secondary education is conducted for five years. In the final year of secondary education, students sit for the Malaysian Certificate of Education examination.[250] Since the introduction of the matriculation programme in 1999, students who completed the 12-month programme in matriculation colleges can enroll in local universities. However, in the matriculation system, only 10 per cent of places are open to non-bumiputera students.[251] Population density (person per km2) in 2010 The infant mortality rate in 2009 was 6 deaths per 1000 births, and life expectancy at birth in 2009 was 75 years.[252] With the aim of developing Malaysia into a medical tourism destination, 5 per cent of the government social sector development budget is spent on health care.[253] The number of live births in Malaysia stood at 508,203 babies in the year 2016. This is a decline compared to 521,136 the previous year. There was also a decline in crude birth rate from 16.7 (2015) to 16.1 (2016) per 1,000 population. Male babies account for 51.7% of all babies born in the year 2016. The highest crude birth rate was reported at Putrajaya (30.4) and the lowest was reported at Penang (12.7). The Julau district has the highest crude birth rate nationwide at 26.9 per 1000 population, meanwhile, the lowest crude birth rate was recorded in the Selangau district. The total fertility rate in Malaysia remains below the replacement level at 1.9 babies in 2017. This is a decline of 0.1 compared to the previous year. The highest crude death rate was reported in Perlis at 7.5 per 1000 population and the lowest crude death rate was reported in Putrajaya (1.9) in 2016. Kuala Penyu was the district with the highest crude death rate while Kinabatangan recorded the lowest crude death rate in the country.[254] The population is concentrated on Peninsular Malaysia,[255] where 20 million out of approximately 28 million Malaysians live.[45] 70 per cent of the population is urban.[157] Kuala Lumpur is the capital[157] and the largest city in Malaysia,[256] as well as its main commercial and financial centre.[257] Putrajaya, a purpose-built city constructed from 1999, is the seat of government,[258] as many executive and judicial branches of the federal government were moved there to ease growing congestion within Kuala Lumpur.[259] Due to the rise in labour-intensive industries,[260] the country is estimated to have over 3 million migrant workers; about 10 per cent of the population.[261] Sabah-based NGOs estimate that out of the 3 million that make up the population of Sabah, 2 million are illegal immigrants.[262] Malaysia hosts a population of refugees and asylum seekers numbering approximately 171,500. Of this population, approximately 79,000 are from Burma, 72,400 from the Philippines, and 17,700 from Indonesia. Malaysian officials are reported to have turned deportees directly over to human smugglers in 2007, and Malaysia employs RELA, a volunteer militia with a history of controversies, to enforce its immigration law.[263] vte Largest cities and municipalities in MalaysiaDepartment of Statistics, Malaysia (2010) Rank Name State Pop.

Approximately 61.3% of the population practice Islam, 19.8% practice Buddhism, 9.2% Christianity, 6.3% Hinduism and 1.3% practice Confucianism, Taoism and other traditional Chinese religions. 0.7% declared no religion and the remaining 1.4% practised other religions or did not provide any information.[9] Sunni Islam of Shafi'i school of jurisprudence is the dominant branch of Islam in Malaysia,[265][266] while 18% are nondenominational Muslims.[267] The Malaysian constitution strictly defines what makes a ""Malay"", considering Malays those who are Muslim, speak Malay regularly, practise Malay customs, and lived in or have ancestors from Brunei, Malaysia and Singapore.[161] Statistics from the 2010 Census indicate that 83.6% of the Chinese population identify as Buddhist, with significant numbers of adherents following Taoism (3.4%) and Christianity (11.1%), along with small Muslim populations in areas like Penang. The majority of the Indian population follow Hinduism (86.2%), with a significant minority identifying as Christians (6.0%) or Muslims (4.1%). Christianity is the predominant religion of the non-Malay bumiputera community (46.5%) with an additional 40.4% identifying as Muslims.[9] Muslims are obliged to follow the decisions of Syariah Courts (i.e. Shariah courts) in matters concerning their religion. The Islamic judges are expected to follow the Shafi'i legal school of Islam, which is the main madh'hab of Malaysia.[265] The jurisdiction of Syariah courts is limited to Muslims in matters such as marriage, inheritance, divorce, apostasy, religious conversion, and custody among others. No other criminal or civil offences are under the jurisdiction of the Syariah courts, which have a similar hierarchy to the Civil Courts. Despite being the supreme courts of the land, the Civil Courts do not hear matters related to Islamic practices.[268] Languages Main article: Languages of Malaysia The distribution of language families of Malaysia shown by colours:(click image to enlarge)   Malayic   Bornean   Aslian   Land Dayak   Sama–Bajaw   Philippine   Chinese   Areas with multiple languages The official and national language of Malaysia is Malaysian,[157] a standardised form of the Malay language.[269] The terminology as per government policy is Bahasa Malaysia (""Malaysian language"")[270][271][272] but legislation continues to refer to the official language as Bahasa Melayu (literally ""Malay language"")[273] and both terms remain in use.[274][275] The National Language Act 1967 specifies the Latin (Rumi) script as the official script of the national language, but does not prohibit the use of the traditional Jawi script.[276] English remains an active second language, with its use allowed for some official purposes under the National Language Act of 1967.[276] In Sarawak, English is an official state language alongside Malaysian.[277][278][279] Historically, English was the de facto administrative language; Malay became predominant after the 1969 race riots (13 May incident).[280] Malaysian English, also known as Malaysian Standard English, is a form of English derived from British English. Malaysian English is widely used in business, along with Manglish, which is a colloquial form of English with heavy Malay, Chinese, and Tamil influences. The government discourages the use of non-standard Malay but has no power to issue compounds or fines to those who use improper Malay on their advertisements.[281][282] Many other languages are used in Malaysia, which contains speakers of 137 living languages.[283] Peninsular Malaysia contains speakers of 41 of these languages.[284] The native tribes of East Malaysia have their own languages which are related to, but easily distinguishable from, Malay. Iban is the main tribal language in Sarawak while Dusunic and Kadazan languages are spoken by the natives in Sabah.[285] Chinese Malaysians predominantly speak Chinese dialects from the southern provinces of China. The more common Chinese varieties in the country are Cantonese, Mandarin, Hokkien, Hakka, Hainanese, and Fuzhou. The Tamil language is used predominantly by a majority of Malaysian Indians along with Telugu, Malayalam. Other South Asian languages are also widely spoken in Malaysia, as well as Thai.[157] A small number of Malaysians have Caucasian ancestry and speak creole languages, such as the Portuguese-based Malaccan Creoles,[286] and the Spanish-based Chavacano language.[287] Culture Main article: Culture of Malaysia A traditional house being built in Sabah Malaysia has a multi-ethnic, multicultural, and multilingual society. The original culture of the area stemmed from indigenous tribes that inhabited it, along with the Malays who later moved there. Substantial influence exists from Chinese and Indian culture, dating back to when foreign trade began. Other cultural influences include the Persian, Arabic, and British cultures. Due to the structure of the government, coupled with the social contract theory, there has been minimal cultural assimilation of ethnic minorities.[288] In 1971, the government created a ""National Cultural Policy"", defining Malaysian culture. It stated that Malaysian culture must be based on the culture of the indigenous peoples of Malaysia, that it may incorporate suitable elements from other cultures, and that Islam must play a part in it.[289] It also promoted the Malay language above others.[290] This government intervention into culture has caused resentment among non-Malays who feel their cultural freedom was lessened. Both Chinese and Indian associations have submitted memorandums to the government, accusing it of formulating an undemocratic culture policy.[289] Some cultural disputes exist between Malaysia and neighbouring countries, notably Indonesia. The two countries have a similar cultural heritage, sharing many traditions and items. However, disputes have arisen over things ranging from culinary dishes to Malaysia's national anthem. Strong feelings exist in Indonesia about protecting their national heritage.[291] The Malaysian government and the Indonesian government have met to defuse some of the tensions resulting from the overlaps in culture.[292] Feelings are not as strong in Malaysia, where most recognise that many cultural values are shared.[291] Fine arts Main article: Malaysian art See also: Music of Malaysia and Malaysian literature A craftsman making batik. Malaysian batik is usually patterned with floral motifs with light colouring. Traditional Malaysian art was mainly centred on the areas of carving, weaving, and silversmithing.[293] Traditional art ranges from handwoven baskets from rural areas to the silverwork of the Malay courts. Common artworks included ornamental kris, beetle nut sets, and woven batik and songket fabrics. Indigenous East Malaysians are known for their wooden masks.[161] Each ethnic group have distinct performing arts, with little overlap between them. However, Malay art does show some North Indian influence due to the historical influence of India.[294] Traditional Malay music and performing arts appear to have originated in the Kelantan-Pattani region with influences from India, China, Thailand, and Indonesia. The music is based around percussion instruments,[294] the most important of which is the gendang (drum). There are at least 14 types of traditional drums.[295] Drums and other traditional percussion instruments and are often made from natural materials.[295] Music is traditionally used for storytelling, celebrating life-cycle events, and occasions such as a harvest.[294] It was once used as a form of long-distance communication.[295] In East Malaysia, gong-based musical ensembles such as agung and kulintang are commonly used in ceremonies such as funerals and weddings.[296] These ensembles are also common in neighbouring regions such as in Mindanao in the Philippines, Kalimantan in Indonesia, and Brunei.[296] Malaysia has a strong oral tradition that has existed since before the arrival of writing, and continues today. Each of the Malay Sultanates created their own literary tradition, influenced by pre-existing oral stories and by the stories that came with Islam.[297] The first Malay literature was in the Arabic script. The earliest known Malay writing is on the Terengganu stone, made in 1303.[161] Chinese and Indian literature became common as the numbers of speakers increased in Malaysia, and locally produced works based in languages from those areas began to be produced in the 19th century.[297] English has also become a common literary language.[161] In 1971, the government took the step of defining the literature of different languages. Literature written in Malay was called ""the national literature of Malaysia"", literature in other bumiputera languages was called ""regional literature"", while literature in other languages was called ""sectional literature"".[290] Malay poetry is highly developed, and uses many forms. The Hikayat form is popular, and the pantun has spread from Malay to other languages.[297] Cuisine Main article: Malaysian cuisine Teh tarikNasi lemakThe national drink and national dish of the country[298][299] Malaysia's cuisine reflects the multi-ethnic makeup of its population.[300] Many cultures from within the country and from surrounding regions have greatly influenced the cuisine. Much of the influence comes from the Malay, Chinese, Indian, Thai, Javanese, and Sumatran cultures,[161] largely due to the country being part of the ancient spice route.[301] The cuisine is very similar to that of Singapore and Brunei,[185] and also bears resemblance to Filipino cuisine.[161] The different states have varied dishes,[185] and often the food in Malaysia is different from the original dishes.[245] Sometimes food not found in its original culture is assimilated into another; for example, Chinese restaurants in Malaysia often serve Malay dishes.[302] Food from one culture is sometimes also cooked using styles taken from another culture,[185] For example, sambal belacan (shrimp paste) are commonly used as ingredients by Chinese restaurants to create the stir fried water spinach (kangkung belacan).[303] This means that although much of Malaysian food can be traced back to a certain culture, they have their own identity.[301] Rice is popular in many dishes. Chili is commonly found in local cuisine, although this does not necessarily make them spicy.[300] Media Main article: Media of Malaysia Radio Televisyen Malaysia Malaysia's main newspapers are owned by the government and political parties in the ruling coalition,[304][305] although some major opposition parties also have their own, which are openly sold alongside regular newspapers. A divide exists between the media in the two halves of the country. Peninsular-based media gives low priority to news from the East, and often treats the eastern states as colonies of the Peninsula.[306] As a result of this, East Malaysia region of Sarawak launched TV Sarawak as internet streaming beginning in 2014, and as TV station on 10 October 2020[307] to overcome the low priority and coverage of Peninsular-based media and to solidify the representation of East Malaysia.[308] The media have been blamed for increasing tension between Indonesia and Malaysia, and giving Malaysians a bad image of Indonesians.[309] The country has Malay, English, Chinese, and Tamil dailies.[306] Freedom of the press is limited, with numerous restrictions on publishing rights and information dissemination.[310] The government has previously tried to crack down on opposition papers before elections.[305] In 2007, a government agency issued a directive to all private television and radio stations to refrain from broadcasting speeches made by opposition leaders,[311] a move condemned by politicians from the opposition Democratic Action Party.[312] Sabah, where all tabloids but one are independent of government control, has the freest press in Malaysia.[306] Laws such as the Printing Presses and Publications Act have also been cited as curtailing freedom of expression.[313] Holidays and festivals Main article: Public holidays in Malaysia Malaysia's largest Buddhist temple—Kek Lok Si in Penang—illuminated in preparation for the Lunar New Year Malaysians observe a number of holidays and festivities throughout the year. Some are federally gazetted public holidays and some are observed by individual states. Other festivals are observed by particular ethnic or religion groups, and the main holiday of each major group has been declared a public holiday. The most observed national holiday is Hari Merdeka (Independence Day) on 31 August, commemorating the independence of the Federation of Malaya in 1957.[161] Malaysia Day on 16 September commemorates federation in 1963.[314] Other notable national holidays are Labour Day (1 May) and the King's birthday (first week of June).[161] Muslim holidays are prominent as Islam is the state religion; Hari Raya Puasa (also called Hari Raya Aidilfitri, Malay for Eid al-Fitr), Hari Raya Haji (also called Hari Raya Aidiladha, Malay for Eid ul-Adha), Maulidur Rasul (birthday of the Prophet), and others being observed.[161] Malaysian Chinese celebrate festivals such as Chinese New Year and others relating to traditional Chinese beliefs. Wesak Day is observed and celebrated by Buddhists. Hindus in Malaysia celebrate Deepavali, the festival of lights,[315] while Thaipusam is a religious rite which sees pilgrims from all over the country converge at the Batu Caves.[316] Malaysia's Christian community celebrates most of the holidays observed by Christians elsewhere, most notably Christmas and Easter. In addition to this, the Dayak community in Sarawak celebrate a harvest festival known as Gawai,[317] and the Kadazandusun community celebrate Kaamatan.[318] Despite most festivals being identified with a particular ethnic or religious group, celebrations are universal. In a custom known as ""open house"" Malaysians participate in the celebrations of others, often visiting the houses of those who identify with the festival.[227] Sports Main article: Sport in Malaysia Traditional sports such as the martial art style Silat Melayu persist alongside modern sports. Popular sports in Malaysia include association football, badminton, field hockey, bowls, tennis, squash, martial arts, horse riding, sailing, and skate boarding.[227] Football is the most popular sport in Malaysia and the country is currently studying the possibility of bidding as a joint host for 2034 FIFA World Cup.[319][320] Badminton matches also attract thousands of spectators, and since 1948 Malaysia has been one of four countries to hold the Thomas Cup, the world team championship trophy of men's badminton.[321] The Malaysian Lawn Bowls Federation was registered in 1997.[322] Squash was brought to the country by members of the British army, with the first competition being held in 1939.[323] The Squash Racquets Association Of Malaysia was created on 25 June 1972.[324] Malaysia has proposed a Southeast Asian football league.[325] The men's national field hockey team ranked 13th in the world as of December 2015[update].[326] The 3rd Hockey World Cup was hosted at Merdeka Stadium in Kuala Lumpur, as well as the 10th cup.[327] The country also has its own Formula One track–the Sepang International Circuit. It runs for 310.408 kilometres (192.88 mi), and held its first Grand Prix in 1999.[328] Traditional sports include Silat Melayu, the most common style of martial arts practised by ethnic Malays in Malaysia, Brunei, and Singapore.[329] The Federation of Malaya Olympic Council was formed in 1953, and received recognition by the IOC in 1954. It first participated in the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games. The council was renamed the Olympic Council of Malaysia in 1964, and has participated in all but one Olympic games since its inception. The largest number of athletes ever sent to the Olympics was 57 to the 1972 Munich Olympic Games.[330] Malaysian athletes have won a total of 13 Olympic medals (8 Silver, 5 Bronze): 9 in badminton, 2 in platform diving, and 2 in cycling.[331][failed verification] Besides Olympic Games, Malaysia also participate din Paralympic Games.[citation needed] The country has competed at the Commonwealth Games since 1950 as Malaya, and 1966 as Malaysia, and the games were hosted in Kuala Lumpur in 1998.[332][333] See also Malaysia portal Asia portal List of Malaysia-related topics Outline of Malaysia Notes ^ Section 9 of the National Language Act 1963/67 states that ""The script of the national language shall be the Rumi script: provided that this shall not prohibit the use of the Malay script, more commonly known as the Jawi script, of the national language"". ^ Section 2 of the National Language Act 1963/67 states that ""Save as provided in this Act and subject to the safeguards contained in Article 152(1) of the Constitution relating to any other language and the language of any other community in Malaysia the national language shall be used for official purposes"". ^ a b See Article 152 of the Federal Constitution of Malaysia and National Language Act 1963/67.

Johor (/dʒəˈhɔːr/; Malay pronunciation: [d͡ʒoho(r)]) is a state of Malaysia in the south of the Malay Peninsula. Johor has land borders with the Malaysian states of Pahang to the north and Malacca and Negeri Sembilan to the northwest. Johor shares maritime borders with Singapore to the south and Indonesia to both the west and east. Johor Bahru is the capital city and the economic centre of the state, Kota Iskandar is the seat of the state government, and Muar serves as the royal town of the state. The old state capital is Johor Lama. As of 2017, the state's population is 3,700,000. Johor has highly diverse tropical rainforests and an equatorial climate. The state's mountain ranges form part of the Titiwangsa Range, which is part of the larger Tenasserim Range connected to Thailand and Myanmar, with Mount Ophir being the highest point in Johor. An early Johor-centred kingdom had early contact with Funan based on the exchange of gifts. After the demise of the kingdom, much of the Malay coast fell under the jurisdiction of Siam and later Majapahit. Several decades later, with the emergence of the Malaccan Empire, Islam spread throughout the Malay Archipelago. After the fall of the empire to the Portuguese, remnants of the Malaccan royal family moved to a river in the southern Malay Peninsula known to the locals as the Johor River and establishing a new sultanate, which became the Johor Empire. Their attempts to retake Malacca resulted in a three-way war between Johor, the Portuguese, and Aceh, another rising sultanate in northern Sumatra. With the arrival of the Dutch East India Company (VOC), Johor ended Portuguese rule and restored its own rule to many of its former dependencies in Sumatra, although Malacca continued to be held by foreign powers. Through an internal dispute within the Johor sultanate and the presence of the East India Company (EIC) in the northern Malay Peninsula, Dutch trade changed from being involved in local disputes to rapidly conquering much of Sumatra and signing the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 with the British to prevent further conflicts with the latter. Under the treaty, the Malay Archipelago was divided under two spheres of influence; the British gained the entire Malay Peninsula while the Dutch surrendered their Malaccan possession in exchange for British Bencoolen and the rest of Sumatra and other territories such as Java located farther south. Under British rule, priority was given towards education and development and the Johor royal administration itself was reformed under a British-style monarchy. The three-year occupation by the Japanese in World War II halted modernisation. After the war, Johor became part of the temporary Malayan Union before being absorbed into the Federation of Malaya under certain terms and gaining full independence through the federation, and subsequently Malaysia on 16 September 1963. Johor has high diversity in ethnicity, culture and language. The state is known for its traditional dance of zapin and Kuda kepang. The head of state is the Sultan of Johor, while the head of government is the Menteri Besar. The government system is closely modelled on the Westminster parliamentary system, with the state administration divided into administrative districts. Islam is the state religion per the 1895 Constitution of Johor, but other religions can be freely practised. Both Malay and English have been accepted as official languages for the state since 1914. The economy is mainly based on services and manufacturing.

Another name, through Portuguese writer Manuel Godinho de Erédia, made reference to Marco Polo's sailing to Ujong Tanah (the end of the Malay Peninsula land) in 1292.[14] Both Ujong Medini and Ujong Tanah had been mentioned since before the foundation of the Sultanate of Malacca. Throughout the period, several other names also co-existed such as Galoh, Lenggiu and Wurawari.[14][21] Johor is also known by its Arabic honorific as دارالتّعظيم (Darul Ta'zim) or ""Abode of Dignity"".[21] History[edit] Historical affiliations Sultanate of Johore 1528–1855 Modern Johore Sultanate 1885–1942; 1945–1946 Unfederated Malay States 1914–1942 Empire of Japan 1942–1945 Malayan Union 1946–1948 Federation of Malaya 1948–1963 Malaysia 1963–present Prehistory[edit] Main article: Prehistoric Malaysia A bronze bell estimated to be from 150 A.D. was found in Kampong Sungai Penchu near the Muar River.[22][23] The bell is believed to have been used as a ceremonial object rather than a trade object as a similar ceremonial bell with the same decorations was found in Battambang Province, Cambodia, suggesting that the Malay coast came in contact with Funan, with the bell being a gift from the early kingdom in mainland Asia to local chieftains in the Malay Peninsula.[22][24] Another important archaeological find was the ancient lost city of Kota Gelanggi, which was discovered by following trails described in an old Malay manuscript once owned by Stamford Raffles.[25] Artefacts gathered in the area have reinforced claims of early human settlement in the state.[26] The claim of Kota Gelanggi as the first settlement is disputed by the state government of Johor, with other evidence from archaeological studies conducted by the state heritage foundation since 1996 suggesting that the historic city is actually located in Kota Tinggi District at either Kota Klang Kiu or Ganggayu. The exact location of the ancient city is still undisclosed, but is said to be within the 14,000-hectare (34,595-acre) forest reserve where the Lenggiu and Madek Rivers are located, based on records in the Malay Annals that, after conquering Gangga Negara, Raja Suran from Siam of the Nakhon Si Thammarat Kingdom (Ligor Kingdom) had sailed to Ganggayu.[27] Since ancient times, most of the coastal Malay Peninsula has had their own rulers, but all fell under the jurisdiction of Siam.[28] Sultanate of Johor[edit] Main article: Johor Sultanate Map of the Dominion of Johor, 1727 After the fall of Malacca in 1511 to the Portuguese, the Johor Sultanate, based on the descendants of the Malaccan Sultanate, was founded by Mahmud's son, Ala'udin Ri'ayat Shah II, in 1528 when he moved the royal court to the Johor River and set up his royal residence in Johor Lama.[29][30] Johor became an empire spanning the southern Malay Peninsula, Riau Archipelago (including Singapore), Anambas Islands, Tambelan Archipelago, Natuna Islands, a region around the Sambas River in south-western Borneo and Siak in Sumatra together with allies of Pahang, Aru and Champa,[31][32] and it aspired to retake Malacca from the Portuguese.[33] The Aceh Sultanate in northern Sumatra had the same ambition, which led to a three-way war among the rivals.[34] During the wars, the Johor administrative capital moved several times based on military strategies and to maintain authority over trading in the region.[29] Johor and the Portuguese began to collaborate against Aceh, which they saw as a common enemy.[35] In 1582 the Portuguese helped Johor thwart an attack by Aceh, but the arrangement ended when Johor attacked the Portuguese in 1587. Aceh continued its attacks against the Portuguese, and was later destroyed when a large armada from the Portuguese port in Goa came to defend Malacca and destroy the sultanate.[36] After Aceh was left weakened, the Dutch East India Company (VOC) arrived and Johor formed an alliance with them to eliminate the Portuguese in the second capture of Malacca in 1641.[37][38] Johor regained authority over many of its former dependencies in Sumatra, such as Siak (1662) and Indragiri (1669), which had fallen to Aceh while Malacca was taken by the Dutch.[36][39] Malacca was placed under the direct control of Batavia in Java.[40] Although Malacca fell under Dutch authority, the Dutch did not establish any further trading posts in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, as they had less interest than what they had over Java and Maluku Islands.[38] Only when the Bugis began to threaten Dutch maritime trade did they become involved with local disputes.[36] The dynasty of the Malaccan descendants lasted until the death of Mahmud II, when it was succeeded by the Bendahara Dynasty, a dynasty of ministers who had previously served in the Malacca Sultanate.[29] The Dutch felt increasingly threatened in the 18th century, especially when the English East India Company started to establish a presence in the northern Malay Peninsula,[41] leading the Dutch to seize the Bugis areas of Riau and expel the Bugis from both Riau and Selangor so these areas would not fall under British rule.[42] This ended Bugis political domination in the Johor-Pahang-Riau empire, resulting in the Bugis being banned from Riau in 1784.[43][44] During the rivalry between the Bugis and Dutch, Mahmud Shah III concluded a treaty of protection with the VOC on board the HNLMS Utrecht and the sultan was allowed to reside in Riau with Dutch protection.[43] Since then, mistrust between the Bugis and Malay escalated.[44] From 1796 to 1801 and from 1807 to 1818, Malacca was placed under British Residency as the Netherlands were conquered by France in the Napoleonic Wars, but it was returned to the Dutch in 1818. Malacca served as the staging area for the British victory in 1811.[45] British protectorate[edit] Main articles: Johor Sultanate § Modern Johore Sultanate, and Unfederated Malay States A painting by John Edmund Taylor showing people in rowboats on the Johor River in the evening seen from Changi in Singapore, July 1879 After the death of Mahmud Shah III, the sultan left two sons through commoner mothers. While the elder son Hussein Shah was supported by the Malay community, the younger son Abdul Rahman Muazzam Shah was supported by the Bugis community.[44] In 1818, the Dutch recognised Abdul Rahman Muazzam Shah as the legitimate heir to the Johor Empire in return for his supporting their intention to establish a trading post in Riau.[46] The following year, the British recognised Hussein Shah as the legitimate heir to the Johor Empire in return for his supporting their intention to establish a trading post in Singapore.[29][44][47] Before his death, Mahmud Shah III had appointed Abdul Rahman as the Temenggong for Johor with recognition from the British as the legitimate Temenggong of Johor-Singapore,[29][48][49] marking the beginning of the Temenggong Dynasty. Abdul Rahman was succeeded by his son, Daeng Ibrahim, although his recognition by the British only occurred 14 years later.[29] Johor Bahru town during the British period, c. 1920 With the partition of the Johor Empire due to the dispute between the Bugis and Malay and following the defined spheres of influence for the British and Dutch resulting from the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824, Daeng Ibrahim intended to create a new administrative centre for the Johor Sultanate under the new dynasty.[50] As he maintained a close relationship with the British and the latter wanted to have full control over trade in Singapore, a treaty was signed between Daeng Ibrahim and Hussein Shah's successor, Ali Iskandar, recognising Ali as the next sultan.[51] Through the treaty, Ali was crowned as the sultan and received $5,000 (in Spanish dollars) and an allowance of $500 per month, but was required to cede the sovereignty of the territory of Johor (except Kesang of Muar, which would be the only territory under his control) to Daeng Ibrahim.[51][52][53] Partition of the Johor Empire before and after the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824[54] Under British influence:   Johor Sultanate   Pahang Kingdom   Singapore Under Dutch influence:   Indragiri Sultanate   Riau-Lingga Sultanate With the establishment of a new capital in mainland Johor, the administrative centre was moved from Telok Blangah in Singapore. As the area was still an undeveloped jungle, the Temenggong encouraged the migration of Chinese and Javanese to clear the land and develop an agricultural economy in Johor. During his reign, Johor began to be modernised and this was continued by his son, Abu Bakar.[29][55] In 1885, an Anglo-Johor Treaty was signed that formalised the close relations between the two, with the British given transit rights for trade through the sultanate territory and responsibility for its foreign relations, as well as providing protection to the latter.[46][53] The treaty also provided for the appointment of a British agent in an advisory role, although no advisor was appointed until 1910.[56] Abu Bakar also implemented a constitution known as the Undang-undang Tubuh Negeri Johor (Johor State Constitution) and organised his administration in a British style.[57] By adopting an English-style modernisation policy, Johor temporarily prevented itself from being directly controlled by the British, as happened to other Malay states.[58][59] Under the reign of Ibrahim, the British appointed Douglas Graham Campbell as an advisor to the sultanate in 1910, although the sultan only appointed Campbell as a General Adviser unlike in other Malayan states which had Resident Advisors, becoming the last Malay state to accept a British Adviser.[29] However, due to Ibrahim's overspending, the sultanate faced problems caused by the falling price of its major source of revenue and problems between him and members of his state council, which gave the British an opportunity to intervene in Johor's internal affairs.[58] Despite Ibrahim's reluctance to appoint a British adviser, Johor was brought under British control as one of the Unfederated Malay States (UMS) by 1914, with the position of its General Adviser elevated to that of a Resident in the Federated Malay States (FMS).[39][46][53][60] Second World War[edit] Main articles: Malayan Campaign, Japanese occupation of Malaya, Battle of Singapore, and Operation Zipper Indian troops embark onto boats during an invasion exercise in southern Johore, 13 November 1941.

Ltd.) began cultivating rubber in the interior of Johor.[64] By the 1920s, Ibrahim had become a personal friend of Tokugawa Yoshichika, a scion of the Tokugawa clan whose ancestors were military leaders (shōgun in Japanese) who ruled Japan from the 16th to the 19th centuries.[62] In the Second World War, at a great cost of lives in the Battle of Muar in Johor as part of the Malayan Campaign,[65] Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) forces with their bicycle infantry and tanks advanced into Muar District (present-day Tangkak District) on 14 January 1942.[66] During the Japanese forces' arrival, Tokugawa accompanied General Tomoyuki Yamashita's troops and was warmly received by Ibrahim when they reached Johor Bahru at the end of January 1942.[66] Yamashita and his officers stationed themselves at the Sultan's residence, Istana Bukit Serene, and the state secretariat building, Sultan Ibrahim Building, to plan for the invasion of Singapore.[67] Some of the Japanese officers were worried since the location of the palace left them exposed to the British, but Yamashita was confident that the British would not attack since Ibrahim was also a friend to the British, which proved to be correct.[62][67] View of the blown up Johor–Singapore Causeway with the gap visible in the middle, which delayed the Japanese conquest of Singapore for over a week to 8 February 1942 On 8 February, the Japanese began to bombard the northwestern coastline of Singapore, which was followed by the crossing of the IJA 5th and 18th Divisions with around 13,000 troops through the Straits of Johor.[68] The following day, the Imperial Guard Division crossed into Kranji while the remaining Japanese Guard troops crossed through the repaired Johor–Singapore Causeway.[68] Following the occupation of the whole of Malaya and Singapore by the Japanese, Tokugawa proposed a reform plan by which the five kingdoms of Johor, Terengganu, Kelantan, Kedah-Penang and Perlis would be restored and federated.[63] Under the scheme, Johor would control Perak, Selangor, Negeri Sembilan and Malacca while an 800-square-mile area in the southern part of Johor would be incorporated into Singapore for defence purposes.[63] The five monarchs of the kingdoms would be obliged to pledge loyalty to Japan, would need to visit the Japanese royal family every two years, and would assure the freedom of religion, worship, employment and private ownership of property to all people and accord every Japanese residing in the kingdoms with treatment equal to indigenous people.[63] Additional Japanese troops advancing through an iron bridge in Labis which had been destroyed by the retreating British forces down the Malayan Peninsula, 22 January 1942 Meanwhile, Ōtani Kōzui of the Nishi Hongan-ji sub-sect of Jōdo Shinshū Buddhism suggested that the sultan system should be abolished and Japan should rule the Malay kingdoms under a Japanese constitutional monarchy government.[63] Japanese War Minister Hideki Tōjō, however, had already reminded their government staff in Malaya to refrain from acting superior to the sultan and to pay respect so the sultan would co-operate with the gunsei (Japanese military organisation).[63] In May, many high-ranking Japanese officials returned to Tokyo to consult with officials of the War Ministry and General Staff on how to deal with the Sultan.[63] Upon their returning to Singapore in July, they published a document called ""A Policy for the Treatment of the Sultan"", which was a demand for the Sultan to surrender his power over his people and land to the Japanese emperor through the IJA commander. The military organisation demanded the Sultan surrender his power in a manner reminiscent of the way the Tokugawa shogunate surrendered their power to the Japanese emperor in 1868.[63] Through the Japanese administration, many massacres towards civilians occurred with an estimate of 25,000 ethnic Chinese civilians in Johor have perished during the occupation.[69] In spite of that, the Japanese established the Endau Settlement (also known as the New Syonan Model Farm) in Endau for Chinese settlers to ease the food supply problem in Singapore.[70] Post-war and independence[edit] Main articles: Malayan Union and Federation of Malaya British Brigadier J J McCully inspects men of the 4th Regiment of the Malayan People’s Anti-Japanese Army (MPAJA) guerrillas at Johor Bahru after the end of war against the Japanese, 1945 At the start of the war, the British had accepted the offer of the Communist Party of Malaya (CPM) to co-operate to fight the Japanese; to do this, the CPM formed the Malayan People’s Anti-Japanese Army (MPAJA).[71] The CPM supporters were mostly Chinese-educated members discriminated against by the English-educated elite and the Babas (Straits-born Chinese) during the British rule whose main objective was to establish gain independence from foreign Empires and to establish a socialist state based on Marxist leninist ideology, similar to Communist victories in the People's Republic of China.[72] The party also had Malay and Indian representatives. They advocated violence as a method to achieving their outcomes.[72] Throughout their war against the Japanese, they also assassinated civilians suspected of collaborating with the Japanese being killed,[73] while kidnapped Malay women were used as comfort women, as had also been done by the Japanese.[74] This led to retaliatory raids from some Malays affected by the attacks who decided to collaborate with the Japanese. This indirectly led to ethnic conflict, especially when ethnic propaganda was being fanned by both sides, leading to the loss of more innocent lives, especially from those who were not involved on either side.[74][75] The Allied forces launched Operation Tiderace and Operation Zipper to liberate Malaya and Singapore. In the five weeks before the British resumed control over Malaya following the Japanese surrender on 16 August 1945, the MPAJA emerged as the de facto authority in the Malayan territory.[71] MPAJA guerrillas marching through the street of Johor Bahru during their disbandment ceremony in December 1945 Johor and the rest of Malaya was officially placed under the British Military Administration (BMA) in September 1945 and the MPAJA was disbanded in December after its secretary-general, Lai Teck (who was also a double agent for the British),[63][76] accepted the return of British colonial rule and adopted a moderate ""open and legal"" struggle for their ideological goals with most members receiving medals from the British the following year.[71][73] Then there was a dispute between the British and CPM since the British had returned and Lai Teck had disappeared with the funds of the CPM. The party administration was taken over by Chin Peng, who abandoned the ""moderate strategy"" in favour of a ""people’s revolutionary war"", culminating in the Malayan Emergency of 1948.[71] In the emergency period, large-scale attacks by the CPM occurred in the present-day Kulai District and other parts of Malaya, but failed to establish Mao Zedong-style ""liberated areas"".[71] Onn Jaafar (left), the Menteri Besar of Johor and founder of the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) with Dr. W. Linehan (right), C.M.G. Adviser on Constitutional Affairs during the Federation of Malaya Agreements in 1948 Fighting between the British occupation forces and their Malayan collaborators against the People's Army continued through the formation of the Malayan Union on 1 April 1946 and the proclamation of the independence of the Federation of Malaya on 31 August 1957.[77] At the time of independence there were three political factions: the Communists, the pro-British, and a race-based coalition. The pro-British side was divided between the Malayan Democratic Union (MDU), which was dominated by English-speaking Chinese and Eurasians who co-operate with left-wing Malay nationalists ""for an independent Malaya that would also include Singapore"" and another pro-British side comprising the Babas under the Straits Chinese British Association (SCBA), who were trying to retain their status and privileges granted for their loyalty to the British during the Straits Settlements era by remaining under British administration.[72][78][79] Meanwhile, the racial coalition, comprising the leading United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) in an alliance with the Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC) and Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA), sought an independent Malaya based on a racial and religious privileges policy and won the 1955 Malayan general election, with the capital of Johor Bahru being the centre of the UMNO party.[44][72] Malaysia[edit] Main articles: Malaysia Agreement and Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation In 1961, the Prime Minister of the Federation of Malaya Tunku Abdul Rahman desired to unite Malaya with the British colonies of North Borneo, Sarawak and Singapore.[80] Despite growing opposition from the governments in both Indonesia and the Philippines as well from Communist sympathisers and nationalists in Borneo, the federation was realised on 16 September 1963, with the sovereign state renamed Malaysia.[81][82] The Indonesian government later launched a ""policy of confrontation"" towards the new federation,[83] which prompted the British and their allies of Australia and New Zealand to deploy armed forces.[84][85] Pontian District became the coastal landing point for amphibious Indonesian troops during the confrontation while Labis and Tenang in Segamat District became the landing point for parachuted Indonesian para-commandos for subversion and sabotage attacks.[86][87][88] Several encounters occurred in Kota Tinggi District, where nine Malayan/Singaporean troops and half of the Indonesian infiltrators were killed and the other Indonesians were captured.[89] Despite several attacks that also cost civilian lives, the Indonesian side did not reach their main objective, and the confrontation ended in 1966 following the internal political struggle in Indonesia resulting from the 30 September Movement.[90][91] Since the end of the confrontation, the state's development has expanded further with industrial estates and new suburbs. Of the total approved development projects for Johor from 1980 until 1990, 69% were concentrated in Johor Bahru and the Pasir Gudang area.[92] Industrial estates and new suburbs were built in settlements on both the northern and eastern sides of the town, including Plentong and Tebrau.[93] The town of Johor Bahru was officially recognised as a city on 1 January 1994.[93] On 22 November 2017, Iskandar Puteri was declared a city and assigned as the administrative center of the state, located in Kota Iskandar.[94] Politics[edit] Dato' Jaafar Muhammad Building in Kota Iskandar, which houses the office of the Menteri Besar of Johor Government[edit] See also: Malaysian State Assembly Representatives (2018-) § Johor, Politics of Malaysia, and Order of precedence in Johor Affiliation Coalition/Party Leader Status Seats 2018 election Current Perikatan Nasional Hasni Mohammad Government 19 29 Pakatan Harapan Aminolhuda Hassan Opposition 36 27 Total 56 56 Government majority 17 2 The Johor Royal Family in 2015 Johor is a constitutional monarchy and was the first state in Malaysia to adopt the system via Undang-undang Tubuh Negeri Johor (the Johor State Constitution) written by Sultan Abu Bakar in 1895.[95][96] The constitutional head of Johor is the Sultan. This hereditary position can only be held by a member of the Johor Royal Family who is descended from Abu Bakar. The current Sultan of Johor is Ibrahim Ismail, who took over the throne on 23 January 2010.[97] The main royal palace for the Sultan is the Bukit Serene Palace, while the royal palace for the Crown Prince is the Istana Pasir Pelangi; both palaces are located in the state capital. Other palaces are the Grand Palace (which is also located in the state capital), Tanjong Palace in Muar, Sri Lambak in Kluang and Shooting Box in Segamat.[98] The Sultan Ismail Building houses the Johor State Legislative Assembly in Kota Iskandar, Iskandar Puteri. The state government is headed by a Menteri Besar, who is assisted by an 11-member executive council (exco) selected from the state assembly members.[99] The legislative branch of Johor's government is the Johor State Legislative Assembly, which is based on the Westminster system. Therefore, the chief minister is appointed based on his or her ability to command the majority of the state assembly. The state assembly makes laws in matters regarding the state. Members of the Assembly are elected by citizens every five years by universal suffrage.[100] There are 56 seats in the assembly. The majority (29 seats) are currently held by Perikatan Nasional (PN) after the Pakatan Harapan government collapse on 28 February. Johor was a sovereign state from 1948 until 1957 while the Federation of Malaya Agreement was in force, but its defence and external affairs were mainly under the control of Britain.[101] The Malayan Federation was then merged with two British colonies in Borneo, North Borneo and Sarawak, to form the Federation of Malaysia. Since then, several disputes have arisen such as the incident involving the state royal family that resulted in the 1993 amendments to the Constitution of Malaysia, disputes with federal leaders on state and federation affairs, and dissatisfaction over slower development in contrast with the long-standing prosperity in neighbouring Singapore, which even led to statements about secession from the Johor Royal Family.[102][103] Other social issues include the rise of racial and religious intolerance among the state's citizens since being part of the federation.[104][105] Administrative divisions[edit] Main articles: List of districts in Malaysia and List of local governments in Malaysia A district and land office in Segamat District. A district council office in Mersing District. A municipal council office in Kluang District. A FELDA office in Kota Tinggi District. Johor is divided into ten districts (daerah), 103 mukims and 16 local governments.[106][107] There are district officers for each district and a village head person (known as a ketua kampung or penghulu) for each village in the district.[108][109][110] Before the British arrival, Johor was run by a group of relatives and friends of the Sultan. A more organised administration was developed in the treaty of friendship with Great Britain in 1885.[111] A British Resident began to be accepted in 1914 when the state became part of the UMS.[112] With the transformation into a British-style administration, more Europeans were appointed into the administration with their role expanding from advising on financial matters to modern administration guidance.[113] Malay state commissioners worked alongside British district officers, known in Johor as ""Assistant Advisers"".[114] When the post of the Resident of the UMS was abolished, other European-held posts in the administration were replaced with locals. As in the rest of Malaysia, local government comes under the purview of state government.[115] Batu Pahat District Johor Bahru District Kluang District Kota Tinggi District Kulai District Mersing District Muar District Pontian District Segamat District Tangkak District INDONESIA SINGAPORE Batu Pahat Iskandar Puteri Johor Bahru Kluang Kota Tinggi Kulai Labis Mersing Muar Pasir Gudang Pengerang Pontian Kechil Segamat Simpang Renggam Tangkak Yong Peng ᴍᴀʟᴀᴄᴄᴀ ɴᴇɢᴇʀɪsᴇᴍʙɪʟᴀɴ ᴘᴀʜᴀɴɢ SouthChinaSea Straits of Johor StraitsofMalacca Districts Capital Area (km2) Population (2010)[4] 1 Batu Pahat District Batu Pahat 1,878 401,902 2 Johor Bahru District Johor Bahru 1,817.8 1,334,188 3 Kluang District Kluang 2,851 288,364 4 Kota Tinggi District Kota Tinggi 3,488 187,824 5 Kulai District Kulai 753 245,294 6 Mersing District Mersing 2,838 69,028 7 Muar District Muar 1,376 239,027 8 Pontian District Pontian Kechil 907 149,938 9 Segamat District Segamat 2,851 182,985 10 Tangkak District Tangkak 970 51,555 Security[edit] Sultan Ibrahim leading the Johor Military Forces (JMF) during the King's Birthday Parade of George V in Singapore, c. 1920 The Ninth Schedule of the Constitution of Malaysia states that the Malaysian federal government is solely responsible for foreign policy and military forces in the country.[116] However, Johor has a private army, the only state to do so. The retention of the army was one of the stipulations in 1946 which Johor made when it participated in the Federation of Malaya.[117] This army, the Royal Johor Military Force (Askar Timbalan Setia Negeri Johor), has since 1886 served as the protector of the Johor monarchs.[118] It is one of the oldest military units in present-day Malaysia and had a significant historical role in the suppression of the 1915 Singapore Mutiny and served in both World Wars.[119] Territorial disputes[edit] Main article: Pedra Branca dispute Map of the disputed island and rocks Johor previously had a territorial dispute with Singapore.[120] Following the publication of the Malaysian Territorial Waters and Continental Shelf Boundaries Map by the government of Malaysia in 1979 that included the island of Batu Puteh (present-day Pedra Branca) as part of their sovereignty, Singapore lodged a formal protest the following year.[121] The dispute originally concerned only the one feature, but when both sides agreed to refer the matter to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in 2003, the dispute was enlarged to include two other features in the vicinity, Middle Rocks (MR) and South Ledge (SL).[120] In 2008 the ICJ decided that ""Batu Puteh belongs to Singapore, Middle Rocks to Malaysia and South Ledge belongs to the state in the territorial waters of which it is located"".[122][123] The final decision by ICJ to award Pedra Branca to Singapore is in line with the 1953 letter made by the Acting State Secretary of Johor in response to the question letter regarding Pedra Branca from the Colonial Secretary of Singapore, where the Johor government openly stated that it does not claim ownership of Pedra Branca despite acknowledging that the old Johor Empire once ruled most of the islands in the area.[124][125] In 2017, Malaysia appealed the case of Pedra Branca based on the conditions required by the ICJ that a case could be revised within six months of discovery of facts and within ten years of the date of judgement following the discovery of several facts.[126] The request was dropped following internal changes in the new Malaysian administration the following year where they subsequently acknowledged Singapore's permanent sovereignty over the island while announcing plans to convert the Middle Rocks, which are under Malaysia's sovereignty, into an island.[127][128] Geography[edit] Johor is located in southern Malay Peninsula as seen from NASA satellite image. The total land area of Johor is nearly 19,166 square kilometres (7,400 sq mi), and it is surrounded by the South China Sea to the east, the Straits of Johor to the south and the Straits of Malacca to the west.[3] The state has a total of 400 kilometres (250 mi) of coastline,[129] of which 237.7 kilometres (147.7 mi) have been eroding.[130] A majority of its coastline, especially on the west coast, covered with mangrove and nipah forests.[131][132][133] The east coast is dominated by sand beaches and rocky headlands,[134] while the south coast consists of a series of alternating headlands and bays.[133] Its exclusive economic zone (EEZ) extends much further in the South China Sea than in the Straits of Malacca.[135] The western part of Johor had a considerable number of peatlands.[136] In 2005, the state recorded 391,499,002 hectares (967,415,102 acres) of forested land, which is classified into natural inland forest, peat swamp forest, mangrove forest and mud flat.[137] The foothills of the Titiwangsa Range extend towards Johor, with the highest point being Mount Ophir, with a height of 1,276 metres.[138] There are another ten mountains in the state with heights from 273 metres to 1,010 metres.[139] About 83% of Johor's terrain is lowlands areas, while only 17% is higher and steep terrain.[137] Forest trees of Johor in tropical rainforest climate Much of central Johor is covered with dense forest, where an extensive network of rivers originating from mountains and hills in the area spreads to the west, east and south.[140] On the west coast, the Batu Pahat River, Muar River and Pontian River flow to the Straits of Malacca, while the Johor River, Malay River, Perepat River, Pulai River, Skudai River and Tebrau River flow to the Straits of Johor in the south. The Endau River, Mersing River, Sedili Besar River and Sedili Kecil River flow to the South China Sea in the east.[137] The Johor River Basin covers an area of 2,690 kilometres, starting from Mount Belumut (east of Kluang) and Mount Gemuruh (to the north) downstream to Tanjung Belungkor.[141] The river itself originates from the Layang-Layang, Linggiu and Sayong rivers before converging into the main river and flowing southeast to the Straits of Johor for 122.7 kilometres. Its tributaries include the Berangan River, Lebak River, Lebam River, Panti River, Pengeli River, Permandi River, Seluyut River, Semangar River, Telor River, Tembioh River and Tiram River.[141] Other river basins in Johor including the Ayer Baloi River, Benut River, Botak Drainage, Jemaluang River, Pontian Besar River, Sanglang River, Santi River and Sarang Buaya River.[142] Johor is located in a tropical region with an equatorial climate. Both the temperature and humidity are consistently high throughout the year with heavy rainfall. Average monthly temperatures are 26 °C (79 °F) to 28 °C (82 °F), with the lowest recorded during the rainy seasons.[137] The west coast receives an average of 2,000 millimetres to 2,500 millimetres of rain, while in the east the average rainfall is higher, with Endau and Pengerang receiving more than 3,400 millimetres of rain a year. The state experiences two monsoon seasons, the northeast and southwest seasons; the northeast occurs from November until March while the southeast occurs from May until September, and the transitional months for the monsoon seasons are April and November.[137] The state experienced extreme flooding from December 2006 to January 2007 with around 60,000–70,000 of the state residents evacuated to emergency shelter.[143][144] Since the state also lies on the Sunda Plate, it experiences tremors from nearby earthquakes in Sumatra, Indonesia.[145] Landscapes of Johor Mount Ophir Rawa Island beach Sunrise over a palm oil plantation Waterfall in Mount Belumut Biodiversity[edit] See also: Protected areas of Johor A female tiger shrike (Lanius tigrinus) in Panti Forest The jungles of Johor host a diverse array of plant and animal species, with an estimated 950 vertebrates species, comprising 200 mammals, 600 birds and 150 reptiles, along with 2,080 invertebrates species.[137] The Endau-Rompin National Park is the largest national park in the state, covering an area of 48,905 hectares (120,847 acres) in northern Johor; its name comes from the Endau and Rompin rivers that flow through the park.[146] There are two entry points for the park, one through Peta with an area of 19,562 hectares (48,339 acres) (about 40% of the total area) with entrance from Kahang in the Mersing District and the other at Kampung Selai with an area of 29,343 hectares (72,508 acres) (about 60% of the total area) with entrance from Bekok in Segamat District.[147][148] Destinations in Peta including the Buaya Sangkut Waterfalls, Upeh Guling Waterfalls, Air Biru Lake, Janing Barat, Nature Education and Research Centre (NERC), Kuala Jasin and Peta indigenous village, while in Selai the area is mostly for hiking and jungle trekking.[148][149] Some iconic mammal species inside the national park include the Asian elephant, clouded leopard, Malayan sun bear, Malayan tapir and Malayan tiger.[150] Heron in a swamp of Johor Gunung Ledang National Park, with an area of 8,611 hectares (21,278 acres) in western Johor, was established in 2005.[151] It has various rivers and streams, waterfalls, diverse rainforest, pines, and sub-montane forest, and Tangkak Dam can also be seen from the park area. Several trails for hiking are available, such as the Asahan Trail, Ayer Panas Trail, Jementah Trail and Lagenda Trail.[151] The state's only marine park, the Sultan Iskandar Park, is located off the east coast and is made up of 13 islands in six clusters, Aur, Besar, Pemanggil, Rawa, Sibu and Tinggi, with an area of more than 8,000 hectares (19,768 acres).[152][153] In 2003, three wetlands in southern Johor comprising Kukup Island, Pulai River and Tanjung Piai were designated as a Ramsar site.[154] Tanjung Piai covers an area of 526 hectares (1,300 acres) of mangroves and another 400 hectares (988 acres) of inter-tidal mudflats,[155] Pulai River with 9,126.0 hectares (22,551 acres)[156] and Kukup Island with 647 hectares (1,599 acres) surrounded by some 800 hectares (1,977 acres) of mudflats.[157] The Pulai River became a seahorse sanctuary and hatchery as part of the state biodiversity masterplan, since Johor's waters are home to three of the eight seahorse species in Malaysia.[158] Crocodile sanctuary in Pasir Gudang. Poaching is a concern, with the number of wild animals in state parks decreasing with the rise of hunting and fishing in the 2000s.[159] In 2004, local authorities uncovered large-scale sandalwood (gaharu) poaching by foreigners in the Endau-Rompin National Park with a large confiscation of protected plant species from the suspects.[160] The conversion of mangrove areas along the southern and eastern coasts into aquaculture projects, sand mining and rapid urbanisation in addition to the abnormal weather patterns caused by climate change and rising sea levels have contributing to the erosion of the state coastline.[161] It has also been discovered that some 68,468 hectares (169,188 acres) of peatland soils in western Johor have been planted with palm oil plantations.[136] In 2017, around 28 rivers in the state were categorised as polluted,[162] leading the authorities and government to push for legislative change and sterner action against river polluters, especially since severe pollution has disrupted the water supply to an estimated 1.8 million people in the state.[163][164] The worst river pollution involving dangerous chemicals happened in 2019 when nearly 6,000 residents in the industrial area of Pasir Gudang were affected with 2,775 hospitalised.[165][166] Forest fires have also become a concern with more than 380 recorded throughout the state in 2016.[167][168] Economy[edit] Johor GDP Share by Sector (2016)[169] Services (47.1%)  Manufacturing (30.6%)  Agriculture (13.5%)  Construction (6.8%)  Import Duties (1.9%) Shipping container in Tanjung Pelepas Port Johor's economy is mainly based on the tertiary sector, namely services, manufacturing, agriculture, construction etc.[170][171] Johor Corporation (JCorp) is a state-owned conglomerate involved in various business activities in the state and overseas.[172][173] In 2017, the gross domestic product (GDP) of Johor was RM104.4 billion, the third highest among Malaysian states after Selangor and Sarawak, while the median income was RM5,652 and the unemployment rate was 3.6%.[174] A year before, the economic growth rate of the state was 5.7% and it accounted for 9.4% of Malaysia's GDP, with GDP per capita at RM31,952.[175] The state has a total workforce of 1.639 million people.[176] Theme park tourism such as the Legoland Malaysia Resort (pictured) has been a major part of the state economy since their opening in 2012.[177][178] Prior to economic diversification, the secondary sector dominated the Johorean economy.[174][179] Johor continues to have a high level of manufacturing investment.[180] From 2013 to 2017, there was a total of RM114.9 billion worth of investment in manufacturing in the state.[181] In 2017, RM16.8 billion came from domestic direct investment and RM5.1 billion came from foreign direct investment, with Australia, China and the United States being the top three foreign investors in manufacturing.[182] The total industrial area in the state as of 2015 was 144 km2 (56 sq mi) or 0.75% of the total land in Johor.[107] In 2000, the largest industries in Johor were metal fabrication and machinery industries, accounting for 27.6% of all manufacturing industries in the state, followed by chemical products, petroleum and rubber industries (20.1%) and wooden products and furniture (14.1%).[107] Palm oil and pineapple plantation in Rengit, Batu Pahat District. The Iskandar Development Region and South Johor Economic Region (Iskandar Malaysia), encompassing the city centre of Johor Bahru, Iskandar Puteri, Kulai District, Pasir Gudang and South Pontian, is a major development zone in the state with an area of 221,634 hectares (2,216.34 km2).[183][184] Southern Johor focuses on trading and services; western Johor focuses on manufacturing, business and modern farming; eastern Johor focuses on ecotourism; and central Johor focuses on both ecotourism and the primary sector economy.[176] A farmers' market in Pontian Kechil, Pontian District. The main agricultural sectors in the state are palm oil plantation, rubber plantations and produce.[107] In 2015, land area used for agriculture in Johor covered 11,555 km2 (4,461 sq mi), 60.15% of the state, with other plantations including herbs and spices.[107][185] In 2016, palm oil plantations covered 7,456 km2 (2,879 sq mi) (38.8% of the total land area), making it the third largest plantation area in Malaysia after Sabah and Sarawak.[186] Farmers' markets (Malay: pasar peladang) are used to distribute the agricultural produces which are located around the state.[187] Johor is the biggest fruit-producing state in Malaysia, with a total fruit plantation area of 414 km2 (160 sq mi) and total harvesting area of 305 km2 (118 sq mi). Approximately 532,249 tons of fruit was produced in 2016, with Segamat District having the largest major fruit plantation and harvesting area in the state with a total area of 111 km2 (43 sq mi) and 66 km2 (25 sq mi), respectively, while Kluang District had the highest total fruit production of 163,714 tons. In the same year, Johor was the second biggest producer of vegetables among Malaysian states after Pahang, with a total vegetable plantation area of 154 km2 (59 sq mi) and a total harvesting area of 143 km2 (55 sq mi). Kluang District also had the largest vegetable plantation and harvesting areas, with a total area of 36 km2 (14 sq mi), and the highest total vegetable production of 60,102 tons.[185] Due to its close proximity to Singapore, known for its financial hubs and international trade centres, the state benefits from Singaporean investors and tourists.[103][188][189] From 1990 to 1992, approved Singapore investments in Johor amounted to about US$500 million in 272 projects.[190] In 1994, the investment from Singapore was nearly 40% of the state's total foreign investment. The state also had a policy of ""twinning with Singapore"" to promote their industrial development, which increased the movement of people and goods between the two sides.[191][192][193] The close economic links between the two began with the establishment of the Indonesia–Malaysia–Singapore Growth Triangle (SIJORI Growth Triangle) in 1989.[194] In 2014, major foreign countries investing in Johor were Singapore (RM6.7 billion), the United States (RM5.4 billion), Japan (RM4.6 billion), the Netherlands (RM3.1 billion), China (RM1.37 billion) and smaller amounts from countries such as Indonesia, South Korea, Germany and India, with the state received RM7.9 billion worth of foreign direct investment (FDI), the second highest among all states in Malaysia after Sarawak.[195] Major foreign companies with FDI in the state come from the United Kingdom, South Korea and China.[174] The medical tourism industry has grown with the arrival of 27,500 medical tourists in 2012 and 33,700 in 2014.[196] Infrastructure[edit] Puteri Harbour Family Park landscapes The Johor Department of Economy Planning is responsible for all public infrastructure planning and development in the state,[197] while the Landscape Department is responsible for the state landscape development.[198] Since the Ninth Malaysia Plan (9MP), the Johor Southern Corridor has been a focus for development.[199] In 2010, the total state land used for commercial buildings was 21.53 km2 (8.31 sq mi), with Johor Bahru District accounting for 12.99 km2 (5.02 sq mi) or 63.5%.[200] Since 2012, around RM2.63 billion has been allocated by the federal and state governments for 33 infrastructure projects in Pengerang in southeastern Johor.[201] The 2015 state budget included spending more than RM500 million for development in the following year, the highest amount ever allocated.[202] The state government also ensured that infrastructure and development projects would be fairly distributed to all districts in the state,[203] with six focus areas outlined in the state government's strategic development plan in 2018.[204] In the same year, the federal government allocated RM250 million for three infrastructure projects to improve connectivity and accessibility within the state capital.[205] Following the recent change in the state government administration, the new government also pledged to provide better infrastructure for investors by improving the road network, providing an adequate water supply for factories and building sub-stations for electricity generation while rejecting foreign companies who masquerade behind green technology to use the state as a solid waste disposal site.[206][207] Energy and water resources[edit] Johor Bahru city centre at dusk Electricity distribution in the state is managed by Tenaga Nasional Bhd. (TNB). Most electricity is generated by coal and gas-fired plants. The coal power plant had a capacity of 700 MW in 2007 and 3,100 MW in 2016, which originated from the Tanjung Bin Power Station in Pontian.[208][209][210] Two gas-fired plants, Pasir Gudang Power Station with 210 MW and Sultan Iskandar Power Station with 269 MW, are located in Pasir Gudang.[211][212] The Pasir Gudang Power Station, however, was retired from the system in 2016.[211] In recent years, the state government has been planning to construct hydropower and combined cycle power plants.[213][214] All water supply pipes in the state are managed by the Water Regulatory Bodies of Johor, with a total of 11 reservoirs: Congok, Gunung Ledang, Gunung Pulai 1, Gunung Pulai 2, Gunung Pulai 3, Juaseh, Layang Lower, Layang Upper, Lebam, Linggiu and Pontian Kechil.[215][216] The state also supplies raw water to Singapore for RM0.03 for every 3.8 cubic metres (1,000 US gal) drawn from Johor rivers. In return, the Johor state government pays the Singaporean government 50 cents (RM0.50) for every 3.8 cubic metres of treated water from Singapore.[217] Telecommunication and broadcasting[edit] A village in Johor with a telephone line Telecommunications in Johor were originally administered by the Posts and Telecommunication Department and maintained by the British Cable & Wireless Communications, which was responsible for all telecommunication services in Malaya.[218][219] During this time, troposcatter was installed on Mount Pulai in Johor and Mount Serapi in Sarawak to connect radio signals between British Malaya and British Borneo, the only such system for both territories to allow simultaneous transmission of radio programs to North Borneo and Sarawak.[220] Following the foundation of the Federation of Malaysia in 1963, the telecommunication departments in Malaya and Borneo merged to form the Telecommunications Department Malaysia in 1968, which later became Telekom Malaysia (TM).[219] Early in 1964, a Nordic telecommunication company, Ericsson, began operating in the country. Following the first AXE telephone exchange in Southeast Asia that went online in Pelangi in 1980, TM was provided with the first mobile telephone network, named ATUR, in 1984.[221] Since then, the Malaysian cellular network has expanded rapidly.[222] From 2013 until 2017, the state mobile-cellular penetration rate has reached 100%, with 11.3% to 11.5% of the population using the internet.[223][224] In 2018, the state internet speed was 10 Mbps with the government urging the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) to develop high-speed Internet infrastructure to reach 100 Mbit/s to match the state's current rapid development.[225] The Malaysian federal government previously operated one state television channel named TV Johor (which was abruptly shut down) and one radio channel, Johor FM.[226] There is one independent radio station, Best FM, which launched in 1988.[227] Television broadcasting in the state is divided into terrestrial and satellite television. There are two types of free-to-air television providers, MYTV Broadcasting (digital terrestrial) and Astro NJOI (satellite), while IPTV is accessed via Unifi TV through the UniFi fibre optic internet subscription.[228] Transportation[edit] Roads[edit] Tebrau Highway leading to the city centre, part of Federal Route 3 The state is linked to the other Malaysian states and federal territories on the western coast through the North–South Expressway and on the eastern coast through Malaysia Federal Route 3. Since British colonial times, there has been a road system linking Johor's capital in the southern Malay Peninsula to Kangar in the north and Kota Bharu on the east coast.[229] The roads in Johor are classified into two categories; 2,369 kilometres (1,472 mi) are federal roads while 19,329 kilometres (12,010 mi) are state roads, as of 2016.[229][230] Johor uses a dual carriageway with the left-hand traffic rule, and towns in the state provide public transportation services such as buses and taxis along with Grab services. The state features Sungai Johor Bridge, the longest central span river-crossing bridge in the country, connecting Johor Bahru and Kota Tinggi District. In 2018, construction of the Iskandar Malaysia Bus Rapid Transit (IMBRT) was announced to be completed before 2021.[231] The previous federal government had allocated RM29.43 billion as part of the Eleventh Malaysia Plan (11MP) for infrastructure projects including upgrading roads and bridges.[232] The state government also spends more than RM600 million for road maintenance annually.[233] Rail[edit] Johor Bahru Sentral railway station in Johor Bahru. Rail transport in the state is operated by Keretapi Tanah Melayu, which consists of Batu Anam, Bekok, Chamek, Genuang, Johor Bahru Sentral Kempas Baru, Kluang, Kulai, Labis, Layang-Layang, Mengkibol, Paloh, Rengam, Senai and Tenang railway stations. The railway line is connected to all of the states in western Peninsular Malaysia. It is also connected to stations in Singapore and Thailand.[234] Air[edit] Senai International Airport in Senai. The Senai International Airport is the largest and the only international airport in Johor, which acts as the main gateway to the state. The airport is located in Senai Town, Kulai District. In 2016, the Malaysian federal government approved a total of RM7 million in upgrades for the airport.[235][236] Four airlines fly to Johor: AirAsia, Malaysia Airlines, Firefly and Malindo Air.[237] Other minor airports including Kluang Airport, Mersing Airport, Segamat Airstrip and Batu Pahat Airstrip in Kluang District, Mersing District, Segamat District and Batu Pahat District, respectively.[238] Water[edit] Puteri Harbour International Ferry Terminal in Iskandar Puteri. Johor has four ports in Iskandar Puteri and Pasir Gudang, which operate under three different companies. The Port of Tanjung Pelepas is part of the Malaysian federal container port,[239] while another two container ports, Integrated Container Terminal (also in Tanjung Pelepas) and Johor Port (in Pasir Gudang).[240][241] The Tanjung Langsat Terminal serves as the state regional oil and gas hub and supports offshore petroleum exploration and production.[242][243] There are boat services to ports in Batam and Tanjung Pinang of the Bintan Islands in Indonesia and to port in Changi in Singapore.[244][245] Healthcare[edit] See also: List of hospitals in Malaysia Sultanah Aminah Hospital, the main government hospital in the state Health-related matters in Johor is administered by the Johor State Health Office (Malay: Jabatan Kesihatan Negeri Johor). The state has two major government hospitals (Sultanah Aminah Hospital and Sultan Ismail Hospital), nine government district hospitals (Permai Hospital, Sultanah Fatimah Hospital, Sultanah Nora Ismail Hospital, Enche' Besar Hajjah Khalsom Hospital, Segamat Hospital, Pontian Hospital, Kota Tinggi Hospital, Mersing Hospital, and Tangkak Hospital), and Temenggung Seri Maharaja Tun Ibrahim Hospital, a women's and children's hospital and mental hospital. Other public health clinics, 1Malaysia clinics and rural clinics are scattered throughout the state with a number of private hospitals such as Penawar Hospital, Johor Specialist Hospital, Regency Specialist Hospital, Pantai Hospital Batu Pahat, Putra Specialist Hospital Batu Pahat, Puteri Specialist Hospital, KPJ Specialist Hospital Muar, Abdul Samad Specialist Hospital, Columbia Asia, Gleneagles Medini Hospital and KPJ Specialist Hospital Pasir Gudang.[246] In 2009, the state's doctor–patient ratio was 3 per 1,000 population.[247] Education[edit] Main articles: List of schools in Johor and List of universities in Malaysia University of Technology Malaysia (UTM) chancellory building. All primary and secondary schools are under the jurisdiction of the Johor State Education Department, under the guidance of the national Ministry of Education.[248] The oldest school in Johor is the English College Johore Bahru (1914).[249] As of 2013, Johor had a total of 240 government secondary schools,[250] fifteen international schools (Austin Heights Private and International Schools,[251] Crescendo-HELP International School,[252] Crescendo International College,[253] Excelsior International School,[254] Paragon Private and International School,[255] Seri Omega Private and International School,[256] Sri Ara International Schools,[257] StarClub Education,[258] Sunway International School,[259] Tenby Schools Setia Eco Gardens,[260] UniWorld International School,[261] and the American School of Iskandar Puteri[262] and three international campuses of British Marlborough College,[263] R.E.A.L Schools[264] and Utama Schools),[265] and nine Chinese independent schools. Johor has a considerable number of Malay and indigenous students enrolled in Chinese schools.[266] There is also an Indonesian school located in the state capital mainly for Indonesian migrants' children.[267] Two Japanese learning centres located in the state capital city.[268] The state government also emphasises pre-school education in the state with the establishment of several kindergartens such as Nuri Kindergarten and Childcare,[269] Stellar Preschool[270] and Tadika Kastil.[271] Southern University College main gate in Skudai, Iskandar Puteri. Johor has three public universities, the University of Technology Malaysia (UTM) in Skudai, Tun Hussein Onn University of Malaysia (UTHM) in Parit Raja, and Universiti Teknologi MARA Johor (UiTM) in Jementah and the state capital; several polytechnics including Ibrahim Sultan Polytechnic and Mersing Polytechnic; and two teaching colleges, IPG Kampus Temenggong Ibrahim in Johor Bahru and IPG Kampus Tun Hussien Onn in Batu Pahat.[272][273] It has one non-profit community college, Southern University College in Skudai.[274] There is also a proposal to establish the University of Johor that has been welcomed by the state Sultan with the federal education ministry also willing to extend their co-operation.[275][276] EduHub Pagoh, the largest public higher education hub area in Malaysia, is being constructed at Bandar Universiti Pagoh, a new well-planned education township in Muar.[277] To ensure the quality of education in the state, the state government introduced six long-term measures to upgrade the capability of local teachers.[278] In 2018, it was reported that Johor was among several Malaysian states facing a teacher shortage, so the federal education ministry set up a special committee to study ways to tackle the problem.[279] Johor State Library is the main public library in the state.[280] Demography[edit] Ethnicity and immigration[edit] Johor residents with families near the end of the year Historical populationYearPop.±%19801,638,229—    19912,162,357+32.0%20002,740,625+26.7%20103,348,283+22.2%20193,764,300+12.4%Source: CityPopulation.de[281] The 2015 Malaysian Census reported the population of Johor at 3,553,600, the second most populous state in Malaysia, with a non-citizen population of 276,900.[282] Of the Malaysian residents, 1,893,100 (53.3%) are Malay, 1,075,100 (31.3%) are Chinese, 230,700 (6.5%) are Indian and another 16,900 (1.5%) identified as other bumiputera.[282] In 2010, the population was estimated to be around 3,230,440, with 1,698,472 (52.0%) Malay, 997,590 (30.0%) Chinese, 209,260 (6.0%) Indian and another 49,773 (1.0%) from other bumiputera.[4] Despite the racial diversity of the population, most people in Johor identify themselves as ""Bangsa Johor"" (English: Johor race), which is also echoed by the state royal family to unite the population regardless of ancestry.[283] Ethnic groups in Johor (2010)[4] Ethnic Percent Malay 52.0% Chinese 30.0% Indian 6.0% Other Bumiputera 1.0% Non-Malaysian citizen 8.0% Girls from the aboriginal people of Johor As Malaysia is one of the least densely populated countries in Asia, the state is particularly sparsely populated, with most people concentrated in the coastal areas, since towns and urban centres have massively expanded through recent developments. From 1991 to 2000, the state experienced 2.39% average annual population growth, with Johor Bahru District being the highest at 4.59% growth and Segamat District being the lowest at 0.07%.[200] The total population increased by about 600,000 every decade following the increase of residential developments in the southern developmental region; if the pattern continues, Johor will have an estimated 5.6 million people in 2030, larger than the government projection of 4 million.[284] Johor's geographical position in the southern Malay Peninsula has contributed to the state's rapid development as Malaysia's transportation and industrial hub, creating jobs and attracting migrants from other states and overseas, especially from Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Myanmar, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and China. As of 2010, nearly two thirds of foreign workers in Malaysia were located in Johor, Sabah and Selangor.[285] Religion[edit] Religion in Johor (2010)[286] Religion Percent Islam 58.2% Buddhism 29.6% Hinduism 6.6% Christianity 3.3% Unknown 1.0% Chinese folk religion 0.8% No religion 0.3% Others 0.2% Place of worship in Johor. Clockwise from top right: Johor Bahru Old Chinese Temple, Church of the Immaculate Conception, Sri Mariamman Temple and the Sultan Abu Bakar State Mosque. Islam became the state religion upon the adoption of 1895 Johor Constitution, although other religions can be freely practised.[287] The religious affiliation of Johor's population according to the 2010 Malaysian Census was 58.2% Muslim, 29.6% Buddhist, 6.6% Hindu, 3.3% Christian, 1.2% followers of other religions or unknown affiliations, 0.8% Taoist or Chinese folk religion adherents, and 0.3% non-religious.[286] The census indicated that 89.8% of the Chinese population in Johor identified as Buddhists, with significant minorities identifying as Christians (6.8%), Chinese folk religion adherents (2.1%) and Muslims (0.4%). The majority of the Indian population identified as Hindus (87.9%), with significant minorities identifying as Christians (4.05%), Muslims (3.83%) and Buddhists (3.05%). The non-Malay bumiputera community was predominantly Christians (42.3%), with significant minorities identifying as Muslims (25.3%) and Buddhists (13.7%). Among the majority population, all Malay bumiputera identified as Muslims.[286] Languages[edit] Multilingual sign in Malay, English and Chinese at a workshop in Kota Tinggi. The majority of Johoreans are at least bilingual with proficiency in Malay and English; both of the languages have been officially recognised in the state constitution since 1914.[288] Other multilingual speakers may also be fluent in Chinese and Tamil languages.[289] Johorean Malay, also known as Johor-Riau Malay and originally spoken in Johor, Riau, Malacca, Selangor and Singapore, has been adopted as the basis for both the Malaysian and Indonesian national languages.[290] Due to Johor's location at the confluence of trade routes within Maritime Southeast Asia as well as its history as an influential empire, the dialect has spread as the region's lingua franca since the 15th century; hence the adoption of the dialect as the basis for the national languages of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore.[291] Several related languages are also spoken in the state such as Orang Seletar (spoken along the Straits of Johor and in northern Singapore), Orang Kanaq (spoken in small parts of southeastern Johor), Jakun (spoken mostly in inland parts of Johor), Temuan (spoken near the border with Pahang and Negeri Sembilan) and Orang Kuala (spoken along the northwest coast of Johor). Terengganu Malay, a distinct variant of Malay, is spoken in the district of Mersing near the border with Rompin, Pahang.[292] Different dialect groups of the Chinese language are spoken among the Chinese community in the state, including Cantonese, Hainanese, Hakka, Hokkien, and Teochew. The Indian community predominantly speaks Tamil. Besides, there is a significant number of Malayalee population in parts of Segamat, Johor Bahru and Masai, who speak Malayalam as their mother tongue. Moreover, small number of other Indian language speakers such as the Telugu, and Punjabi language speakers too exist. Many Malayalees and Telugus are often categorised as Tamils by the Tamils themselves, and by other major races, as they use the Tamil language as a lingua franca among other Indian communities. In 2017, the Johor queen, as the royal patron of the Malaysian English Language Teaching Association (MELTA), called for a more conducive environment for young Malaysians to master English since there has been a drastic decline in proficiency among the younger Malaysian generation.[293][294] Culture[edit] See also: Culture of Malaysia The Johor Heritage Foundation building in the state capital Johor's culture has been influenced by different ethnicities throughout history, especially by the Arabs, Bugis and Javanese people, with the state also becoming a mixture of different cultures among the Chinese, Indian, Malay and aboriginal people.[295][296] Zapin performance in a school in Batu Pahat A strong Arab cultural influence is apparent in art performances like zapin, masri and hamdolok and in musical instruments like the gambus.[297][298] The zapin dance was introduced in the 14th century by Arab Muslim missionaries from Hadhramaut, Yemen, and was originally performed only by male dancers, although female dancers are now common.[299] The dance itself differs among five Johor regions, namely zapin tenglu and zapin pulau (Mersing), zapin lenga (Muar), zapin pekajang (Johor Bahru), zapin koris (Batu Pahat) and zapin parit mustar with zapin seri bunian (Pontian).[299] Another Arab legacy is the use of Arabic names with wadi (valley) for areas populated by the Arab community in the state capital such as ""wadi hana"" and ""wadi hassan"".[300] Buginese and Javanese cultural influences are found in the bosara and kuda kepang dances introduced to Johor before the early 20th century by Buginese and Javanese immigrants.[301][302] Indian culture inspired the ghazal. These cultural activities are normally performed at Malay weddings and religious festivals.[298] The aboriginal culture is also unique with a diversity of traditions still practised, such as the making of traditional weapons, medicines, handicrafts and souvenirs.[303] Chingay parade celebration in the capital city as part of Chinese New Year festivities in 2018 The Chinese community holds the Chingay parade annually by the Johor Bahru Old Chinese Temple, which unites the five Chinese ethnic groups in Johor, namely Cantonese, Hainanese, Hakka, Hoklo and Teochew.[304] This co-operation among different Chinese cultures under a voluntary organisation became a symbol of harmony among the different Chinese people that deepens their sense of heritage to preserve their culture traditions.[305] The Johor Bahru Chinese Heritage Museum describes the history of Chinese migration into Johor from the 14th to 19th centuries during the Ming and Qing dynasties. The ruler of Johor encouraged the Chinese community to plant gambier and pepper in the interior; many of these farmers switched to pineapple cultivation in the 20th century, making Johor one of Malaysia's top fruit producers.[306] Cuisine[edit] Mee bandung in Johor Cuisine in Johor has been influenced by Arab, Buginese, Javanese, Malay, Chinese and Indian cultures. Notable dishes include asam pedas, cathay laksa, cheese murtabak, Johor laksa, kway teow kia, mee bandung, mee rebus, Muar satay, pineapple pajeri, Pontian wonton noodle, san lou fried bee hoon, otak-otak, telur pindang,[307][308] and other mixed Malay dishes.[309] Popular desserts include burasak,[309] kacang pool, lontong and snacks like banana cake, Kluang toasted buns and pisang goreng.[308][310] International restaurants for Western food, Filipino food, Indonesian food, Japanese food, Korean food, Taiwanese food, Thai food and Vietnamese food are found throughout the state, especially in Johor Bahru and Iskandar Puteri.[311] Holidays and festivals[edit] Johoreans observe a number of holidays and festivals throughout the year including Independence Day, Malaysia Day celebrations and the Sultan of Johor's Birthday.[312] Additional local and international festivals held annually in the state capital include the Japanese bon odori, kuda kepang and kite and art festivals. Sports[edit] The Tan Sri Dato' Haji Hassan Yunos Stadium was the home stadium of Johor Darul Ta'zim until 2019. As Johor has been part of Malaya since 1957, its athletes represented Malaya and later Malaysia at the Summer Olympic Games, Commonwealth Games, Asian Games and Southeast Asian Games. The Johor State Youth and Sports Department was established in 1957 to raise the standard of sports in the state.[313] Johor hosted the Sukma Games in 1992. There are four sports complexes in the state,[314] and the federal government also provides aid to improve sports facilities.[315] In 2018, as part of a federal government plan to turn Muar into Johor's sports hub, around RM15 million has been allocated to build and upgrade sports facilities in the town.[316] Located in Iskandar Puteri, the Sultan Ibrahim Stadium is the main stadium of football team Johor Darul Ta'zim. The team was founded in 1972 as PKENJ FC and became Johor Darul Ta'zim in 2013. It won the Malaysia FA Cup in 1998 and 2016, the Malaysia Cup in 1985, 1991, 2017 and 2019, the Malaysia Super League for seven consecutive seasons between 2014 and 2020,[317] and the AFC Cup in 2015.[318][319][320] The state women's football team also won four titles in the Tun Sharifah Rodziah Cup in 1984, 1986, 1987 and 1989. Another notable stadium in the state is Pasir Gudang Corporation Stadium in Pasir Gudang.[321] Johor also has established its own e-sports league and sets to become the second Malaysian state to introduce the sports in Sukma Games after Perak where the Johor Sports Council agreed to include the sports in the 2020 Sukma Games hosted by the state.[322][323] References[edit] ^ a b c ""Maklumat Kenegaraan (Negeri Johor Darul Ta'zim)"" [Statehood Information (State of Johor Darul Ta'zim)] (in Malay).

In 1979, Malaysia had published a map entitled “Territorial Waters and Continental Shelf Boundaries of Malaysia” in which Batu Puteh (BP) was shown as forming a part of Malaysian territory. That inclusion was, in fact, a deliberate step taken by the cartographers to reaffirm Malaysia’s sovereignty over BP which had always been a part of the original Sultanate of Johor since ancient times. In February 1980, Singapore lodged a protest against the inclusion of BP in the 1979 Map. That began a protracted dispute between Malaysia and Singapore, spanning almost three decades.

As we have done since the beginning of the pandemic, the university continues to monitor COVID-19 conditions in our community. The availability of vaccines and robust testing means that our fall plans remain feasible. We will communicate with the campus community about any changes in policies. We encourage all UT students, faculty and staff members to get vaccinated. COVID-19 vaccines are our best  tool to help us #ProtectTexasTogether. Learn more about UT’s vaccine distribution plans UT Vaccine Incentive Program We are celebrating students, faculty and staff who have taken an important step towards #ProtectingTexasTogether by choosing to get vaccinated. Learn how to win prizes Flexible Working Arrangements Vaccinations Health and Wellness Academics Flexible Working Arrangements Returning to Campus Starting in June, remote employees began returning to onsite work with supervisor approval using a phased-in schedule. We are excited to pilot more widespread use of flexible work arrangements during the 2021-22 academic year. Your supervisors and HR reps will have more detailed information, but here’s a summary: During May, a cross-campus leadership task force developed campus-wide guidelines that have now been shared with College, School and Unit (CSU) leadership. In June, CSUs developed their own specific plans based on these guidelines. In July, units determined if and how they might implement flexible work arrangements following their CSU’s guidelines. In September, our “near normal” will be in full swing. Learn more about returning to campus Vaccinations Make your appointment COVID-19 vaccination appointments are open to members of the UT community and the general public age 12 and older. It takes all of us to stop the spread of COVID-19. We encourage everyone to get vaccinated when they are eligible. When enough people get vaccinated, it makes the spread of COVID-19 from person to person unlikely, and the whole community becomes protected. This is called herd immunity, and we need as many people as possible to get vaccinated in order to achieve this. Learn more about vaccinations Health and Wellness We’re in this together We are asking for your assistance in minimizing the spread of COVID. Masks are strongly recommended indoors regardless of vaccination status. To decrease potential exposure to the virus, limit your social interactions and be more vigilant about practicing preventive behaviors. Participate in the UT Proactive Community Testing program.

UT Austin Utilities and Energy Management says it was investigating and working to restore power earlier on Tuesday. It has an outage map, which previously showed a number of buildings across campus having power issues. UT Austin is on its own power grid, separate from Austin Energy. It uses natural gas to power the buildings on its main campus, according to a UT Austin Utilities and Energy Management fact sheet. The university has been on its own grid since the early 20th Century — the Hal C. Weaver Power plant was built in 1928 and the campus installed its first generator in 1929.

Established in 1877, the university is the first imperial university and currently selected as a Top Type university of Top Global University Project by the Japanese government.[8] UTokyo has ten faculties, 15 graduate schools[9] and enrolls about 30,000 students, about 4,200 of whom are international students.[10] In particular, the number of privately funded international students, who account for more than 80%, has increased 1.75 times in the 10 years since 2010, and the university is focusing on supporting international students.[11] Its five campuses are in Hongō, Komaba, Kashiwa, Shirokane and Nakano. It is considered to be the most selective and prestigious university in Japan.[12][13][14] As of 2020, University of Tokyo's alumni, faculty members and researchers include seventeen Prime Ministers, 17 Nobel Prize laureates, four Pritzker Prize laureates, five astronauts, and a Fields Medalist.[15] Contents 1 History 2 Academics 2.1 Graduate programs 2.2 Research 2.2.1 Research institutes 3 Academic rankings and reputation 3.1 Pass rate for bar exam 4 Evaluation from Business World 5 Gender imbalance 6 Campus 6.1 Hongo Campus 6.1.1 Sanshiro Pond 6.2 Komaba Campus 6.3 Kashiwa Campus 6.4 Shirokanedai Campus 6.5 Nakano Campus 7 Notable alumni and faculty members 8 See also 9 References 10 Further reading 11 External links History[edit] Faculty of Law building in 1902, before its destruction by the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake The university was chartered by the Meiji government in 1877 under its current name by amalgamating older government schools for medicine, various traditional scholars and modern learning. It was renamed ""the Imperial University (帝國大學, Teikoku daigaku)"" in 1886, and then Tokyo Imperial University (東京帝國大學, Tōkyō teikoku daigaku) in 1897 when the Imperial University system was created. In September 1923, an earthquake and the following fires destroyed about 750,000 volumes of the Imperial University Library.[16][17] The books lost included the Hoshino Library (星野文庫, Hoshino bunko), a collection of about 10,000 books.[17][18] The books were the former possessions of Hoshino Hisashi before becoming part of the library of the university and were mainly about Chinese philosophy and history. In 1947 after Japan's defeat in World War II it re-assumed its original name. With the start of the new university system in 1949, Todai swallowed up the former First Higher School (today's Komaba campus) and the former Tokyo Higher School, which thenceforth assumed the duty of teaching first- and second-year undergraduates, while the faculties on Hongo main campus took care of third- and fourth-year students. Although the university was founded during the Meiji period, it has earlier roots in the Astronomy Agency (天文方; 1684), Shoheizaka Study Office (昌平坂学問所; 1797), and the Western Books Translation Agency (蕃書和解御用; 1811).[19] These institutions were government offices established by the 徳川幕府 Tokugawa shogunate (1603–1867), and played an important role in the importation and translation of books from Europe. According to The Japan Times, the university had 1,282 professors in February 2012. Of those, 58 were women.[20] Comparing the number of professors in May 2020, there are 108 women among the 1,298 professors, which has almost doubled.[2] The university is steadily closing the gender gap, and by April 2021, half of its directors were women.[21] In the fall of 2012 and for the first time, the University of Tokyo started two undergraduate programs entirely taught in English and geared toward international students—Programs in English at Komaba (PEAK)—the International Program on Japan in East Asia and the International Program on Environmental Sciences.[22][23] In 2014, the School of Science at the University of Tokyo introduced an all-English undergraduate transfer program called Global Science Course (GSC).[24] Institute for Cosmic Ray Research, The University of Tokyo, started, on May 28, 2021, construction of the ""Hyper-Kamiokande"" device, for a new world-leading international scientific research project which is set to start experiments in 2027.[25] University of Tokyo School of Law Building Komaba Library Main Building of Institute for Solid State Physics of the University of Tokyo Koishikawa Botanical Gardens Komaba research campus Academics[edit] The University of Tokyo is organized into 10 faculties[26] and 15 graduate schools.[27] College of Arts and Sciences and Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Faculty of Agriculture and Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences Faculty of Economics and Graduate School of Economics Faculty of Education and Graduate School of Education Faculty of Engineering and Graduate School of Engineering Faculty of Law and Graduate School for Law and Politics Faculty of Letters and Graduate School of Humanities and Sociology Faculty of Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences Faculty of Science and Graduate School of Science Graduate School of Frontier Sciences Graduate School of Information Science and Technology Graduate School of Interdisciplinary Information Studies Graduate School of Mathematical Sciences Graduate School of Public Policy Graduate programs[edit] Todai Law School is considered one of the top law schools in Japan, ranking first in the number of successful candidates of Japanese Bar Examination in 2020.[28] Eduniversal ranked Japanese business schools, and the Faculty of Economics in Todai is placed 4th in Japan (111th in the world).[29] Research[edit] The University of Tokyo is considered a top research institution of Japan. It receives the largest amount of national grants for research institutions, Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [ja], receiving 40% more than the University with 2nd largest grants and 90% more than the University with 3rd largest grants.[30] This massive financial investment from the Japanese government directly affects Todai's research outcomes. According to Thomson Reuters, Todai is the best research university in Japan.[31] Its research excellence is especially distinctive in Physics (1st in Japan, 2nd in the world), Biology & Biochemistry (1st in Japan, 3rd in the world), Pharmacology & Toxicology (1st in Japan, 5th in the world), Materials Science (3rd in Japan, 19th in the world), Chemistry (2nd in Japan, 5th in the world), and Immunology (2nd in Japan, 20th in the world).[32] In another ranking, Nikkei Shimbun on 16 February 2004 surveyed about the research standards in Engineering studies based on Thomson Reuters, Grants in Aid for Scientific Research and questionnaires to heads of 93 leading Japanese Research Centers, and Todai was placed 4th (research planning ability 3rd/informative ability of research outcome 10th/ability of business-academia collaboration 3rd) in this ranking.[33] Weekly Diamond [ja] also reported that Todai has the 3rd highest research standard in Japan in terms of research fundings per researchers in COE Program [ja].[34] In the same article, it is also ranked 21st in terms of the quality of education by GP [ja] funds per student.

Reuters World rankings include non-educational institutions University of Tokyo (Todai) is considered to be the most selective and prestigious university in Japan and is counted as one of the best universities in the world.[12][13][14] Nikkei BP has been publishing a ranking system ""Brand rankings of Japanese universities"" every year, composed by the various indications related to the power of brand, and Todai has been 2nd in 2009–2010 in Greater Tokyo Area.[62][45] The university has been ranked 1st during 2006–2010 in the ranking ""Truly Strong Universities"" by Toyo Keizai.[42] In another ranking, Japanese prep school Kawaijuku [ja] ranked Todai as the best university in Japan.[43] Todai was ranked second in the world, behind Harvard University, in Mines ParisTech: Professional Ranking of World Universities (2011), which measured universities' numbers of alumni holding CEO positions in Fortune Global 500 companies. Academic Ranking of World Universities ranked the University of Tokyo 1st in Asia and 20th in the world in 2012.

In the field of physical science treatises, it ranked second in the world among universities.[76] In November 2018 Expertscape recognized it as #9 in the world for expertise in Pancreatic Cancer.[77] University of Tokyo was ranked 26th among the world's best universities and 1st in Asia and Japan in 2019 according to the Top 500 Global Universities Rankings produced by CEOWORLD magazine.[78][citation needed] Todai alumni are distinctively successful in Japanese industries. According to the Weekly Economist [ja]'s 2010 rankings, graduates from Todai have the 12th best employment rate in 400 major companies in Japan.[79] However, this lower ranking position is because of the large number of alumni who become government bureaucrats, which is more than double of alumni from any other universities.[80] In fact, alumni of Todai have the highest average salary in Japan, according to PRESIDENT [ja].[81] Pass rate for bar exam[edit] School of Law was 3rd out of all the 74 law schools in Japan according to the ratio, 78.91%, of the successful graduates who passed the bar examinations from 2007 to 2017 on average.[82] In 2019, School of Law became 3rd out of all the 72 law schools in Japan according to the ratio, 56.30%, of the successful graduates who passed the bar examination.[83][84] Evaluation from Business World[edit] The university ranking of the ratio of ""president and chief executive officer of listed company"" Ranking all universities in Japan 1st[85]　out of all the 744[86] universities which existed as of 2006 Source 2006 Survey[85] by Weekly Diamond [ja] on the ranking of the universities which produced the high ratio of the graduates who hold the position of ""president and chief executive officer of listed company"" to all the graduates of each university The university ranking according to the ratio of the number of the officers & managers produced by each university to the number of graduates Ranking all universities in Japan 33rd[87]　out of all the 778[88] universities which existed as of 2010 Source 2010 Survey[87] by Weekly Economist [ja] on the ranking of universities according to the ratio of the number of the officers & managers produced by each university to the number of graduates The university ranking according to the evaluation by Personnel Departments of Leading Companies in Japan Ranking Japan 4th[89] (out of 788[90] universities in Japan as of 2021) Source 2021 Nikkei Survey to all listed (3,755[91]) and leading unlisted (1,095), totally 4,850 companies[89] Gender imbalance[edit] In 2019, enrollment figures from the University of Tokyo reveal that 5,267 of 24,674 (21.3%) domestic students are female. The ratio is more equal among international students, where 1,465 of 3,735 (39.2%) students are female.[92] The gender imbalance is more stark among the faculty, where 7.8 percent of professors are female.[93] Within student life, some clubs excluded female students even though the university discourages such a practice. Of more than 30 tennis clubs at the University of Tokyo, even though no clubs announced that they reject female students, only two actively recruited women, allowing them to join without passing the exam required for male applicants.[94][95] In 2020, the Orientation Committee announced that clubs that did not admit female students' membership could not join circle recruitment events.[96] Since 2017, the University of Tokyo has paid thirty thousand yen in housing allowances for female students exclusively in order to gain more female applicants from distant regions.[97] Campus[edit] Hongo Campus[edit] The main Hongo campus occupies the former estate of the Maeda family, Edo period feudal lords of Kaga Province.[98] One of the university's best known landmarks, Akamon (the Red Gate), is a relic of this era. The symbol of the university is the ginkgo leaf, from the trees found throughout the area. The Hongo campus also hosts the University of Tokyo's annual May Festival.[99] Yasuda Auditorium Akamon (the Red Gate) Letters building Information Center First Medical Building Second Medical Building Medical Experimental Research building Medical Library General Library The Experimental Tank Faculty of Engineering Sanshiro Pond[edit] Sanshiro Pond (三四郎池, Sanshirō ike), university's Hongo campus, dates to 1615. After the fall of the Osaka Castle, the shōgun gave this pond and its surrounding garden to Maeda Toshitsune. With further development of the garden by Maeda Tsunanori, it became known as one of the most beautiful gardens in Edo (Now Tokyo), with the traditional eight landscapes and eight borders, and known for originality in artificial pond, hills, and pavilions. It was at that time known as Ikutoku-en (Garden of Teaching Virtue). The pond's contours are in the shape of the character kokoro or shin (heart), and thus its official name is Ikutoku-en Shinjiike. It has been commonly called Sanshiro Pond after the title of Natsume Sōseki's novel Sanshiro. Komaba Campus[edit] Main article: University of Tokyo, Komaba Campus One of the five campuses of the University of Tokyo, the Komaba Campus is home to the College of Arts and Sciences, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the Graduate School of Mathematical Sciences, and a number of advanced research facilities and campus services.

Established in 1877, the university is the first imperial university and currently selected as a Top Type university of Top Global University Project by the Japanese government.[8] UTokyo has ten faculties, 15 graduate schools[9] and enrolls about 30,000 students, about 4,200 of whom are international students.[10] In particular, the number of privately funded international students, who account for more than 80%, has increased 1.75 times in the 10 years since 2010, and the university is focusing on supporting international students.[11] Its five campuses are in Hongō, Komaba, Kashiwa, Shirokane and Nakano. It is considered to be the most selective and prestigious university in Japan.[12][13][14] As of 2020, University of Tokyo's alumni, faculty members and researchers include seventeen Prime Ministers, 17 Nobel Prize laureates, four Pritzker Prize laureates, five astronauts, and a Fields Medalist.[15] Contents 1 History 2 Academics 2.1 Graduate programs 2.2 Research 2.2.1 Research institutes 3 Academic rankings and reputation 3.1 Pass rate for bar exam 4 Evaluation from Business World 5 Gender imbalance 6 Campus 6.1 Hongo Campus 6.1.1 Sanshiro Pond 6.2 Komaba Campus 6.3 Kashiwa Campus 6.4 Shirokanedai Campus 6.5 Nakano Campus 7 Notable alumni and faculty members 8 See also 9 References 10 Further reading 11 External links History[edit] Faculty of Law building in 1902, before its destruction by the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake The university was chartered by the Meiji government in 1877 under its current name by amalgamating older government schools for medicine, various traditional scholars and modern learning. It was renamed ""the Imperial University (帝國大學, Teikoku daigaku)"" in 1886, and then Tokyo Imperial University (東京帝國大學, Tōkyō teikoku daigaku) in 1897 when the Imperial University system was created. In September 1923, an earthquake and the following fires destroyed about 750,000 volumes of the Imperial University Library.[16][17] The books lost included the Hoshino Library (星野文庫, Hoshino bunko), a collection of about 10,000 books.[17][18] The books were the former possessions of Hoshino Hisashi before becoming part of the library of the university and were mainly about Chinese philosophy and history. In 1947 after Japan's defeat in World War II it re-assumed its original name. With the start of the new university system in 1949, Todai swallowed up the former First Higher School (today's Komaba campus) and the former Tokyo Higher School, which thenceforth assumed the duty of teaching first- and second-year undergraduates, while the faculties on Hongo main campus took care of third- and fourth-year students. Although the university was founded during the Meiji period, it has earlier roots in the Astronomy Agency (天文方; 1684), Shoheizaka Study Office (昌平坂学問所; 1797), and the Western Books Translation Agency (蕃書和解御用; 1811).[19] These institutions were government offices established by the 徳川幕府 Tokugawa shogunate (1603–1867), and played an important role in the importation and translation of books from Europe. According to The Japan Times, the university had 1,282 professors in February 2012. Of those, 58 were women.[20] Comparing the number of professors in May 2020, there are 108 women among the 1,298 professors, which has almost doubled.[2] The university is steadily closing the gender gap, and by April 2021, half of its directors were women.[21] In the fall of 2012 and for the first time, the University of Tokyo started two undergraduate programs entirely taught in English and geared toward international students—Programs in English at Komaba (PEAK)—the International Program on Japan in East Asia and the International Program on Environmental Sciences.[22][23] In 2014, the School of Science at the University of Tokyo introduced an all-English undergraduate transfer program called Global Science Course (GSC).[24] Institute for Cosmic Ray Research, The University of Tokyo, started, on May 28, 2021, construction of the ""Hyper-Kamiokande"" device, for a new world-leading international scientific research project which is set to start experiments in 2027.[25] University of Tokyo School of Law Building Komaba Library Main Building of Institute for Solid State Physics of the University of Tokyo Koishikawa Botanical Gardens Komaba research campus Academics[edit] The University of Tokyo is organized into 10 faculties[26] and 15 graduate schools.[27] College of Arts and Sciences and Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Faculty of Agriculture and Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences Faculty of Economics and Graduate School of Economics Faculty of Education and Graduate School of Education Faculty of Engineering and Graduate School of Engineering Faculty of Law and Graduate School for Law and Politics Faculty of Letters and Graduate School of Humanities and Sociology Faculty of Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences Faculty of Science and Graduate School of Science Graduate School of Frontier Sciences Graduate School of Information Science and Technology Graduate School of Interdisciplinary Information Studies Graduate School of Mathematical Sciences Graduate School of Public Policy Graduate programs[edit] Todai Law School is considered one of the top law schools in Japan, ranking first in the number of successful candidates of Japanese Bar Examination in 2020.[28] Eduniversal ranked Japanese business schools, and the Faculty of Economics in Todai is placed 4th in Japan (111th in the world).[29] Research[edit] The University of Tokyo is considered a top research institution of Japan. It receives the largest amount of national grants for research institutions, Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [ja], receiving 40% more than the University with 2nd largest grants and 90% more than the University with 3rd largest grants.[30] This massive financial investment from the Japanese government directly affects Todai's research outcomes. According to Thomson Reuters, Todai is the best research university in Japan.[31] Its research excellence is especially distinctive in Physics (1st in Japan, 2nd in the world), Biology & Biochemistry (1st in Japan, 3rd in the world), Pharmacology & Toxicology (1st in Japan, 5th in the world), Materials Science (3rd in Japan, 19th in the world), Chemistry (2nd in Japan, 5th in the world), and Immunology (2nd in Japan, 20th in the world).[32] In another ranking, Nikkei Shimbun on 16 February 2004 surveyed about the research standards in Engineering studies based on Thomson Reuters, Grants in Aid for Scientific Research and questionnaires to heads of 93 leading Japanese Research Centers, and Todai was placed 4th (research planning ability 3rd/informative ability of research outcome 10th/ability of business-academia collaboration 3rd) in this ranking.[33] Weekly Diamond [ja] also reported that Todai has the 3rd highest research standard in Japan in terms of research fundings per researchers in COE Program [ja].[34] In the same article, it is also ranked 21st in terms of the quality of education by GP [ja] funds per student. Todai also has been recognized for its research in the social sciences and humanities. In January 2011, Repec ranked Todai's Economics department as Japan's best economics research university.[35] And it is the only Japanese university within world top 100.[36] Todai has produced 9 presidents of the Japanese Economic Association, the largest number in the association.[37] Asahi Shimbun summarized the number of academic papers in Japanese major legal journals by university, and Todai was ranked top during 2005–2009.[38] Research institutes[edit] [39][40] Institute of Medical Science Earthquake Research Institute Institute of Advanced Studies on Asia Institute of Social Science Institute of Industrial Science Historiographical Institute Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Institute for Cosmic Ray Research Institute for Solid State Physics Atmosphere and Ocean Research Institute Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology The University's School of Science and the Earthquake Research Institute are both represented on the national Coordinating Committee for Earthquake Prediction.[41] Academic rankings and reputation[edit] University rankingsToyo Keizai National[42] General 1Kawaijuku [ja] National[43] General 1T.

Academic Ranking of World Universities ranked the University of Tokyo 1st in Asia and 20th in the world in 2012. Times Higher Education World University Rankings ranked the University of Tokyo 27th in the world in 2013[63] and 1st in the Asia University ranking in 2013.[64] In 2015, Times Higher Education World University Rankings ranked the institution 23rd in the world.[65] It ranks 12th in the world according to the Times Higher Education World Reputation Rankings 2016. QS World University Rankings[66] in 2011 ranked the University of Tokyo 25th in the world (in 2010 Times Higher Education World University Rankings and QS World University Rankings parted ways to produce separate rankings). In the 2011 QS Asian University Rankings, which employs a different methodology, the University of Tokyo came 4th.[67] Currently, University of Tokyo holds ranks 9th & 11th respectively for Natural Sciences & Engineering, two of its traditionally strong disciplines.[68][69] In 2019, University of Tokyo ranked 24th among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[70] Times Higher Education World Reputation Rankings ranked the University of Tokyo 12th in the world also 1st in Asia in 2016. Global University Ranking ranked the University of Tokyo 3rd in the world and 1st in Asia.[71] Human Resources & Labor Review, a human competitiveness index & analysis published in Chasecareer Network, ranked the university 21st internationally and 1st in Asia in 2010.[72] Nature Index ranked the University of Tokyo #6 in 2015 and #8 in 2017 in its Annual Tables, which measure the largest contributors to papers published in 82 leading journals.[73][74][75] In the Nature Index Annual Tables 2021, the University of Tokyo was ranked 8th based on 1,308 Natural science research treatises published by the university. In the field of physical science treatises, it ranked second in the world among universities.[76] In November 2018 Expertscape recognized it as #9 in the world for expertise in Pancreatic Cancer.[77] University of Tokyo was ranked 26th among the world's best universities and 1st in Asia and Japan in 2019 according to the Top 500 Global Universities Rankings produced by CEOWORLD magazine.[78][citation needed] Todai alumni are distinctively successful in Japanese industries. According to the Weekly Economist [ja]'s 2010 rankings, graduates from Todai have the 12th best employment rate in 400 major companies in Japan.[79] However, this lower ranking position is because of the large number of alumni who become government bureaucrats, which is more than double of alumni from any other universities.[80] In fact, alumni of Todai have the highest average salary in Japan, according to PRESIDENT [ja].[81] Pass rate for bar exam[edit] School of Law was 3rd out of all the 74 law schools in Japan according to the ratio, 78.91%, of the successful graduates who passed the bar examinations from 2007 to 2017 on average.[82] In 2019, School of Law became 3rd out of all the 72 law schools in Japan according to the ratio, 56.30%, of the successful graduates who passed the bar examination.[83][84] Evaluation from Business World[edit] The university ranking of the ratio of ""president and chief executive officer of listed company"" Ranking all universities in Japan 1st[85]　out of all the 744[86] universities which existed as of 2006 Source 2006 Survey[85] by Weekly Diamond [ja] on the ranking of the universities which produced the high ratio of the graduates who hold the position of ""president and chief executive officer of listed company"" to all the graduates of each university The university ranking according to the ratio of the number of the officers & managers produced by each university to the number of graduates Ranking all universities in Japan 33rd[87]　out of all the 778[88] universities which existed as of 2010 Source 2010 Survey[87] by Weekly Economist [ja] on the ranking of universities according to the ratio of the number of the officers & managers produced by each university to the number of graduates The university ranking according to the evaluation by Personnel Departments of Leading Companies in Japan Ranking Japan 4th[89] (out of 788[90] universities in Japan as of 2021) Source 2021 Nikkei Survey to all listed (3,755[91]) and leading unlisted (1,095), totally 4,850 companies[89] Gender imbalance[edit] In 2019, enrollment figures from the University of Tokyo reveal that 5,267 of 24,674 (21.3%) domestic students are female. The ratio is more equal among international students, where 1,465 of 3,735 (39.2%) students are female.[92] The gender imbalance is more stark among the faculty, where 7.8 percent of professors are female.[93] Within student life, some clubs excluded female students even though the university discourages such a practice. Of more than 30 tennis clubs at the University of Tokyo, even though no clubs announced that they reject female students, only two actively recruited women, allowing them to join without passing the exam required for male applicants.[94][95] In 2020, the Orientation Committee announced that clubs that did not admit female students' membership could not join circle recruitment events.[96] Since 2017, the University of Tokyo has paid thirty thousand yen in housing allowances for female students exclusively in order to gain more female applicants from distant regions.[97] Campus[edit] Hongo Campus[edit] The main Hongo campus occupies the former estate of the Maeda family, Edo period feudal lords of Kaga Province.[98] One of the university's best known landmarks, Akamon (the Red Gate), is a relic of this era. The symbol of the university is the ginkgo leaf, from the trees found throughout the area. The Hongo campus also hosts the University of Tokyo's annual May Festival.[99] Yasuda Auditorium Akamon (the Red Gate) Letters building Information Center First Medical Building Second Medical Building Medical Experimental Research building Medical Library General Library The Experimental Tank Faculty of Engineering Sanshiro Pond[edit] Sanshiro Pond (三四郎池, Sanshirō ike), university's Hongo campus, dates to 1615. After the fall of the Osaka Castle, the shōgun gave this pond and its surrounding garden to Maeda Toshitsune. With further development of the garden by Maeda Tsunanori, it became known as one of the most beautiful gardens in Edo (Now Tokyo), with the traditional eight landscapes and eight borders, and known for originality in artificial pond, hills, and pavilions. It was at that time known as Ikutoku-en (Garden of Teaching Virtue). The pond's contours are in the shape of the character kokoro or shin (heart), and thus its official name is Ikutoku-en Shinjiike. It has been commonly called Sanshiro Pond after the title of Natsume Sōseki's novel Sanshiro. Komaba Campus[edit] Main article: University of Tokyo, Komaba Campus One of the five campuses of the University of Tokyo, the Komaba Campus is home to the College of Arts and Sciences, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the Graduate School of Mathematical Sciences, and a number of advanced research facilities and campus services. This is the campus where all the freshmen and sophomores of the University of Tokyo spend their college life. The University of Tokyo is the only university in Japan which has a system of two years of general education before students can choose and move on to special fields of study.[citation needed] The Komaba Campus is the cornerstone of general education, and was designated as the ""center of excellence"" for three new areas of research by the Ministry of Education and Science. There are currently over 7,000 students (freshmen and sophomores) enrolled in the general education courses, about 450 students (juniors and seniors) pursuing their specialties in the College of Arts and Sciences, and 1,400 graduate students in the advanced study. Komaba Campus Building Main Auditorium Southern Complex Kashiwa Campus[edit] One of the five campuses of the University of Tokyo, the Kashiwa Campus is home to the Graduate School of Frontier Sciences and a number of advanced research facilities and campus services. The Kashiwa Campus also hosts the Institute for Cosmic Ray Research(ICRR), which is entirely dedicated to postgraduate studies.

It is considered to be the most selective and prestigious university in Japan.[12][13][14] As of 2020, University of Tokyo's alumni, faculty members and researchers include seventeen Prime Ministers, 17 Nobel Prize laureates, four Pritzker Prize laureates, five astronauts, and a Fields Medalist.[15] Contents 1 History 2 Academics 2.1 Graduate programs 2.2 Research 2.2.1 Research institutes 3 Academic rankings and reputation 3.1 Pass rate for bar exam 4 Evaluation from Business World 5 Gender imbalance 6 Campus 6.1 Hongo Campus 6.1.1 Sanshiro Pond 6.2 Komaba Campus 6.3 Kashiwa Campus 6.4 Shirokanedai Campus 6.5 Nakano Campus 7 Notable alumni and faculty members 8 See also 9 References 10 Further reading 11 External links History[edit] Faculty of Law building in 1902, before its destruction by the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake The university was chartered by the Meiji government in 1877 under its current name by amalgamating older government schools for medicine, various traditional scholars and modern learning. It was renamed ""the Imperial University (帝國大學, Teikoku daigaku)"" in 1886, and then Tokyo Imperial University (東京帝國大學, Tōkyō teikoku daigaku) in 1897 when the Imperial University system was created. In September 1923, an earthquake and the following fires destroyed about 750,000 volumes of the Imperial University Library.[16][17] The books lost included the Hoshino Library (星野文庫, Hoshino bunko), a collection of about 10,000 books.[17][18] The books were the former possessions of Hoshino Hisashi before becoming part of the library of the university and were mainly about Chinese philosophy and history. In 1947 after Japan's defeat in World War II it re-assumed its original name. With the start of the new university system in 1949, Todai swallowed up the former First Higher School (today's Komaba campus) and the former Tokyo Higher School, which thenceforth assumed the duty of teaching first- and second-year undergraduates, while the faculties on Hongo main campus took care of third- and fourth-year students. Although the university was founded during the Meiji period, it has earlier roots in the Astronomy Agency (天文方; 1684), Shoheizaka Study Office (昌平坂学問所; 1797), and the Western Books Translation Agency (蕃書和解御用; 1811).[19] These institutions were government offices established by the 徳川幕府 Tokugawa shogunate (1603–1867), and played an important role in the importation and translation of books from Europe. According to The Japan Times, the university had 1,282 professors in February 2012. Of those, 58 were women.[20] Comparing the number of professors in May 2020, there are 108 women among the 1,298 professors, which has almost doubled.[2] The university is steadily closing the gender gap, and by April 2021, half of its directors were women.[21] In the fall of 2012 and for the first time, the University of Tokyo started two undergraduate programs entirely taught in English and geared toward international students—Programs in English at Komaba (PEAK)—the International Program on Japan in East Asia and the International Program on Environmental Sciences.[22][23] In 2014, the School of Science at the University of Tokyo introduced an all-English undergraduate transfer program called Global Science Course (GSC).[24] Institute for Cosmic Ray Research, The University of Tokyo, started, on May 28, 2021, construction of the ""Hyper-Kamiokande"" device, for a new world-leading international scientific research project which is set to start experiments in 2027.[25] University of Tokyo School of Law Building Komaba Library Main Building of Institute for Solid State Physics of the University of Tokyo Koishikawa Botanical Gardens Komaba research campus Academics[edit] The University of Tokyo is organized into 10 faculties[26] and 15 graduate schools.[27] College of Arts and Sciences and Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Faculty of Agriculture and Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences Faculty of Economics and Graduate School of Economics Faculty of Education and Graduate School of Education Faculty of Engineering and Graduate School of Engineering Faculty of Law and Graduate School for Law and Politics Faculty of Letters and Graduate School of Humanities and Sociology Faculty of Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences Faculty of Science and Graduate School of Science Graduate School of Frontier Sciences Graduate School of Information Science and Technology Graduate School of Interdisciplinary Information Studies Graduate School of Mathematical Sciences Graduate School of Public Policy Graduate programs[edit] Todai Law School is considered one of the top law schools in Japan, ranking first in the number of successful candidates of Japanese Bar Examination in 2020.[28] Eduniversal ranked Japanese business schools, and the Faculty of Economics in Todai is placed 4th in Japan (111th in the world).[29] Research[edit] The University of Tokyo is considered a top research institution of Japan. It receives the largest amount of national grants for research institutions, Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [ja], receiving 40% more than the University with 2nd largest grants and 90% more than the University with 3rd largest grants.[30] This massive financial investment from the Japanese government directly affects Todai's research outcomes. According to Thomson Reuters, Todai is the best research university in Japan.[31] Its research excellence is especially distinctive in Physics (1st in Japan, 2nd in the world), Biology & Biochemistry (1st in Japan, 3rd in the world), Pharmacology & Toxicology (1st in Japan, 5th in the world), Materials Science (3rd in Japan, 19th in the world), Chemistry (2nd in Japan, 5th in the world), and Immunology (2nd in Japan, 20th in the world).[32] In another ranking, Nikkei Shimbun on 16 February 2004 surveyed about the research standards in Engineering studies based on Thomson Reuters, Grants in Aid for Scientific Research and questionnaires to heads of 93 leading Japanese Research Centers, and Todai was placed 4th (research planning ability 3rd/informative ability of research outcome 10th/ability of business-academia collaboration 3rd) in this ranking.[33] Weekly Diamond [ja] also reported that Todai has the 3rd highest research standard in Japan in terms of research fundings per researchers in COE Program [ja].[34] In the same article, it is also ranked 21st in terms of the quality of education by GP [ja] funds per student. Todai also has been recognized for its research in the social sciences and humanities. In January 2011, Repec ranked Todai's Economics department as Japan's best economics research university.[35] And it is the only Japanese university within world top 100.[36] Todai has produced 9 presidents of the Japanese Economic Association, the largest number in the association.[37] Asahi Shimbun summarized the number of academic papers in Japanese major legal journals by university, and Todai was ranked top during 2005–2009.[38] Research institutes[edit] [39][40] Institute of Medical Science Earthquake Research Institute Institute of Advanced Studies on Asia Institute of Social Science Institute of Industrial Science Historiographical Institute Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Institute for Cosmic Ray Research Institute for Solid State Physics Atmosphere and Ocean Research Institute Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology The University's School of Science and the Earthquake Research Institute are both represented on the national Coordinating Committee for Earthquake Prediction.[41] Academic rankings and reputation[edit] University rankingsToyo Keizai National[42] General 1Kawaijuku [ja] National[43] General 1T.

Academic Ranking of World Universities ranked the University of Tokyo 1st in Asia and 20th in the world in 2012. Times Higher Education World University Rankings ranked the University of Tokyo 27th in the world in 2013[63] and 1st in the Asia University ranking in 2013.[64] In 2015, Times Higher Education World University Rankings ranked the institution 23rd in the world.[65] It ranks 12th in the world according to the Times Higher Education World Reputation Rankings 2016. QS World University Rankings[66] in 2011 ranked the University of Tokyo 25th in the world (in 2010 Times Higher Education World University Rankings and QS World University Rankings parted ways to produce separate rankings). In the 2011 QS Asian University Rankings, which employs a different methodology, the University of Tokyo came 4th.[67] Currently, University of Tokyo holds ranks 9th & 11th respectively for Natural Sciences & Engineering, two of its traditionally strong disciplines.[68][69] In 2019, University of Tokyo ranked 24th among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[70] Times Higher Education World Reputation Rankings ranked the University of Tokyo 12th in the world also 1st in Asia in 2016. Global University Ranking ranked the University of Tokyo 3rd in the world and 1st in Asia.[71] Human Resources & Labor Review, a human competitiveness index & analysis published in Chasecareer Network, ranked the university 21st internationally and 1st in Asia in 2010.[72] Nature Index ranked the University of Tokyo #6 in 2015 and #8 in 2017 in its Annual Tables, which measure the largest contributors to papers published in 82 leading journals.[73][74][75] In the Nature Index Annual Tables 2021, the University of Tokyo was ranked 8th based on 1,308 Natural science research treatises published by the university. In the field of physical science treatises, it ranked second in the world among universities.[76] In November 2018 Expertscape recognized it as #9 in the world for expertise in Pancreatic Cancer.[77] University of Tokyo was ranked 26th among the world's best universities and 1st in Asia and Japan in 2019 according to the Top 500 Global Universities Rankings produced by CEOWORLD magazine.[78][citation needed] Todai alumni are distinctively successful in Japanese industries. According to the Weekly Economist [ja]'s 2010 rankings, graduates from Todai have the 12th best employment rate in 400 major companies in Japan.[79] However, this lower ranking position is because of the large number of alumni who become government bureaucrats, which is more than double of alumni from any other universities.[80] In fact, alumni of Todai have the highest average salary in Japan, according to PRESIDENT [ja].[81] Pass rate for bar exam[edit] School of Law was 3rd out of all the 74 law schools in Japan according to the ratio, 78.91%, of the successful graduates who passed the bar examinations from 2007 to 2017 on average.[82] In 2019, School of Law became 3rd out of all the 72 law schools in Japan according to the ratio, 56.30%, of the successful graduates who passed the bar examination.[83][84] Evaluation from Business World[edit] The university ranking of the ratio of ""president and chief executive officer of listed company"" Ranking all universities in Japan 1st[85]　out of all the 744[86] universities which existed as of 2006 Source 2006 Survey[85] by Weekly Diamond [ja] on the ranking of the universities which produced the high ratio of the graduates who hold the position of ""president and chief executive officer of listed company"" to all the graduates of each university The university ranking according to the ratio of the number of the officers & managers produced by each university to the number of graduates Ranking all universities in Japan 33rd[87]　out of all the 778[88] universities which existed as of 2010 Source 2010 Survey[87] by Weekly Economist [ja] on the ranking of universities according to the ratio of the number of the officers & managers produced by each university to the number of graduates The university ranking according to the evaluation by Personnel Departments of Leading Companies in Japan Ranking Japan 4th[89] (out of 788[90] universities in Japan as of 2021) Source 2021 Nikkei Survey to all listed (3,755[91]) and leading unlisted (1,095), totally 4,850 companies[89] Gender imbalance[edit] In 2019, enrollment figures from the University of Tokyo reveal that 5,267 of 24,674 (21.3%) domestic students are female. The ratio is more equal among international students, where 1,465 of 3,735 (39.2%) students are female.[92] The gender imbalance is more stark among the faculty, where 7.8 percent of professors are female.[93] Within student life, some clubs excluded female students even though the university discourages such a practice. Of more than 30 tennis clubs at the University of Tokyo, even though no clubs announced that they reject female students, only two actively recruited women, allowing them to join without passing the exam required for male applicants.[94][95] In 2020, the Orientation Committee announced that clubs that did not admit female students' membership could not join circle recruitment events.[96] Since 2017, the University of Tokyo has paid thirty thousand yen in housing allowances for female students exclusively in order to gain more female applicants from distant regions.[97] Campus[edit] Hongo Campus[edit] The main Hongo campus occupies the former estate of the Maeda family, Edo period feudal lords of Kaga Province.[98] One of the university's best known landmarks, Akamon (the Red Gate), is a relic of this era. The symbol of the university is the ginkgo leaf, from the trees found throughout the area. The Hongo campus also hosts the University of Tokyo's annual May Festival.[99] Yasuda Auditorium Akamon (the Red Gate) Letters building Information Center First Medical Building Second Medical Building Medical Experimental Research building Medical Library General Library The Experimental Tank Faculty of Engineering Sanshiro Pond[edit] Sanshiro Pond (三四郎池, Sanshirō ike), university's Hongo campus, dates to 1615. After the fall of the Osaka Castle, the shōgun gave this pond and its surrounding garden to Maeda Toshitsune. With further development of the garden by Maeda Tsunanori, it became known as one of the most beautiful gardens in Edo (Now Tokyo), with the traditional eight landscapes and eight borders, and known for originality in artificial pond, hills, and pavilions. It was at that time known as Ikutoku-en (Garden of Teaching Virtue). The pond's contours are in the shape of the character kokoro or shin (heart), and thus its official name is Ikutoku-en Shinjiike. It has been commonly called Sanshiro Pond after the title of Natsume Sōseki's novel Sanshiro. Komaba Campus[edit] Main article: University of Tokyo, Komaba Campus One of the five campuses of the University of Tokyo, the Komaba Campus is home to the College of Arts and Sciences, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the Graduate School of Mathematical Sciences, and a number of advanced research facilities and campus services. This is the campus where all the freshmen and sophomores of the University of Tokyo spend their college life. The University of Tokyo is the only university in Japan which has a system of two years of general education before students can choose and move on to special fields of study.[citation needed] The Komaba Campus is the cornerstone of general education, and was designated as the ""center of excellence"" for three new areas of research by the Ministry of Education and Science. There are currently over 7,000 students (freshmen and sophomores) enrolled in the general education courses, about 450 students (juniors and seniors) pursuing their specialties in the College of Arts and Sciences, and 1,400 graduate students in the advanced study. Komaba Campus Building Main Auditorium Southern Complex Kashiwa Campus[edit] One of the five campuses of the University of Tokyo, the Kashiwa Campus is home to the Graduate School of Frontier Sciences and a number of advanced research facilities and campus services. The Kashiwa Campus also hosts the Institute for Cosmic Ray Research(ICRR), which is entirely dedicated to postgraduate studies. Shirokanedai Campus[edit] The relatively small Shirokanedai Campus[100] hosts the Institute of Medical Science of the University of Tokyo (IMSUT), which is entirely dedicated to postgraduate studies. The campus is focused on genome research, including among its facilities the Human Genome Center (HGC), which have at its disposal the largest supercomputer in the field.[101] Nakano Campus[edit] Notable alumni and faculty members[edit] Main article: List of University of Tokyo people See also: List of Nobel laureates affiliated with the University of Tokyo The university has produced many notable people. 15 prime ministers of Japan have studied at the University of Tokyo.[102] Former prime minister Kiichi Miyazawa ordered Japanese government agencies to reduce the rate of employees who had attended the university's law faculty to below 50 percent due to concerns about diversity in the bureaucracy.[103] 11 alumni of University of Tokyo have received the Nobel Prize.[104] Sin-Itiro Tomonaga, Physics, 1965 Yasunari Kawabata, Literature, 1968 Leo Esaki, Physics, 1973 Eisaku Satō, Peace, 1974 Kenzaburō Ōe, Literature, 1994 Masatoshi Koshiba, Physics, 2002 Yoichiro Nambu, Physics, 2008 Ei-ichi Negishi, Chemistry, 2010 Takaaki Kajita, Physics, 2015 Satoshi Ōmura, Medicine, 2015 Yoshinori Ohsumi, Medicine, 2016 Two alumni of University of Tokyo have received the Fields Medal or Gauss Prize.

Ontario is bordered by the province of Manitoba to the west, Hudson Bay and James Bay to the north, and Quebec to the east and northeast, and to the south by the U.S. states of (from west to east) Minnesota, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York. Almost all of Ontario's 2,700 km (1,678 mi) border with the United States follows inland waterways: from the westerly Lake of the Woods, eastward along the major rivers and lakes of the Great Lakes/Saint Lawrence River drainage system. These include Rainy River, Pigeon River, Lake Superior, St. Marys River, Lake Huron, St. Clair River, Lake St. Clair, Detroit River, Lake Erie, Niagara River, Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River from Kingston, to the Quebec boundary just east of Cornwall. There is only about 1 km (0.6 mi) of land border, made up of portages including Height of Land Portage on the Minnesota border.[13] Ontario is sometimes conceptually divided into two regions, Northern Ontario and Southern Ontario. The great majority of Ontario's population and arable land is in the south. In contrast, the larger, northern part of Ontario is sparsely populated with cold winters and heavy forestation.[14] Contents 1 Etymology 2 Geography 2.1 Climate 3 History 3.1 Pre-European contact 3.2 European contact 3.3 Upper Canada 3.4 Canada West 3.5 Provincehood 3.6 Territorial evolution 4 Demographics 4.1 Religion 4.2 Language 5 Economy 5.1 Agriculture 5.2 Energy 6 Government, law and politics 6.1 Law 6.2 Politics 6.3 Administrative divisions 6.4 Urban areas 7 Education 7.1 Higher education 8 Culture 8.1 Songs and slogans 8.2 Professional sports 8.3 Notable residents 8.4 Museums 9 Transportation 9.1 Air travel 9.2 Railways 9.3 Roads 9.4 Waterways 10 See also 11 Notes 12 References 12.1 Citations 12.2 Sources 13 Further reading 14 External links Etymology[edit] The province is named after Lake Ontario, a term thought to be derived from Ontarí:io, a Huron (Wyandot) word meaning ""great lake"",[15] or possibly skanadario, which means ""beautiful water"" in the Iroquoian languages.[16] Ontario has about 250,000 freshwater lakes.[17] Geography[edit] Main article: Geography of Ontario See also: List of census divisions of Ontario, Geography of Canada, and List of parks and protected areas of Ontario Typical landscape of the Canadian Shield at Queen Elizabeth II Wildlands Provincial Park, located in Central Ontario The province consists of three main geographical regions: The thinly populated Canadian Shield in the northwestern and central portions, which comprises over half the land area of Ontario. Although this area mostly does not support agriculture, it is rich in minerals, partly covered by the Central and Midwestern Canadian Shield forests, and studded with lakes and rivers. Northern Ontario is subdivided into two sub-regions: Northwestern Ontario and Northeastern Ontario. The virtually unpopulated Hudson Bay Lowlands in the extreme north and northeast, mainly swampy and sparsely forested. Southern Ontario, which is further sub-divided into four sub-regions: Central Ontario (although not actually the province's geographic centre), Eastern Ontario, Golden Horseshoe and Southwestern Ontario (parts of which were formerly referred to as Western Ontario). Despite the absence of any mountainous terrain in the province, there are large areas of uplands, particularly within the Canadian Shield which traverses the province from northwest to southeast and also above the Niagara Escarpment which crosses the south. The highest point is Ishpatina Ridge at 693 metres (2,274 ft) above sea level in Temagami, Northeastern Ontario. In the south, elevations of over 500 m (1,640 ft) are surpassed near Collingwood, above the Blue Mountains in the Dundalk Highlands and in hilltops near the Madawaska River in Renfrew County. The Carolinian forest zone covers most of the southwestern region of the province. The temperate and fertile Great Lakes-Saint Lawrence Valley in the south is part of the Eastern Great Lakes lowland forests ecoregion where the forest has now been largely replaced by agriculture, industrial and urban development. A well-known geographic feature is Niagara Falls, part of the Niagara Escarpment. The Saint Lawrence Seaway allows navigation to and from the Atlantic Ocean as far inland as Thunder Bay in Northwestern Ontario. Northern Ontario covers approximately 87% of the province's surface area; conversely Southern Ontario contains 94% of the population. Point Pelee is a peninsula of Lake Erie in southwestern Ontario (near Windsor and Detroit, Michigan) that is the southernmost extent of Canada's mainland. Pelee Island and Middle Island in Lake Erie extend slightly farther. All are south of 42°N – slightly farther south than the northern border of California. Climate[edit] See also: Climate of Ontario Köppen climate types of Ontario Ontario's climate varies by season and location.[18] Three air sources affect it: cold, dry, arctic air from the north (dominant factor during the winter months, and for a longer part of the year in far northern Ontario); Pacific polar air crossing in from the western Canadian Prairies/US Northern Plains; and warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean.[19] The effects of these major air masses on temperature and precipitation depend mainly on latitude, proximity to major bodies of water and to a small extent, terrain relief.[19] In general, most of Ontario's climate is classified as humid continental.[19] Ontario has three main climatic regions: The surrounding Great Lakes greatly influence the climatic region of southern Ontario.[18] During the fall and winter, the release of heat stored by the lakes moderates the climate near the shores.[20] This gives parts of southern Ontario milder winters than mid-continental areas at lower latitudes.[20] Parts of Southwestern Ontario (generally south of a line from Sarnia–Toronto) have a moderate humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfa), similar to the inland Mid-Atlantic states and the Great Lakes portion of the Midwestern United States. The region has warm to hot, humid summers and cold winters. Annual precipitation ranges from 750–1,000 mm (30–39 in) and is well distributed throughout the year. Most of this region lies in the lee of the Great Lakes, making for abundant snow in some areas. In December 2010, the snowbelt set a new record when it was hit by more than a metre of snow within 48 hours.[21] The next climatic region is Central and Eastern Ontario, which has a moderate humid continental climate (Köppen Dfb). This region has warm and sometimes hot summers with colder, longer winters, ample snowfall (even in regions not directly in the snowbelts) and annual precipitation similar to the rest of Southern Ontario.[19] In the northeastern parts of Ontario, extending south as far as Kirkland Lake, the cold waters of Hudson Bay depress summer temperatures, making it cooler than other locations at similar latitudes. The same is true on the northern shore of Lake Superior, which cools hot, humid air from the south, leading to cooler summer temperatures.[19] Along the eastern shores of Lake Superior and Lake Huron winter temperatures are slightly moderated but come with frequent heavy lake-effect snow squalls that increase seasonal snowfall totals to upwards of 3 m (10 ft) in some places. These regions have higher annual precipitation, in some places over 100 cm (39 in). Cold northwesterly wind over the Great Lakes creating lake-effect snow. Lake-effect snow most frequently occurs in the snowbelt regions of the province. The northernmost parts of Ontario – primarily north of 50°N – have a subarctic climate (Köppen Dfc) with long, severely cold winters and short, cool to warm summers with dramatic temperature changes possible in all seasons. With no major mountain ranges blocking sinking Arctic air masses, temperatures of −40 °C (−40 °F) are not uncommon; snow remains on the ground for sometimes over half the year. Snow accumulation can be high in some areas.[18] Precipitation is generally less than 70 cm (28 in) and peaks in the summer months in the form of rain or thunderstorms.[18] Severe thunderstorms peak in summer. Windsor, in Southern (Southwestern) Ontario, has the most lightning strikes per year in Canada, averaging 33 days of thunderstorm activity per year.[22] In a typical year, Ontario averages 11 confirmed tornado touchdowns. However, over the last 4 years,[when?] it has had upwards of 20 tornado touchdowns per year, with the highest frequency in the Windsor-Essex – Chatham Kent area, though few are very destructive (the majority between F0 to F2 on the Fujita scale). Ontario had a record 29 tornadoes in both 2006 and 2009. Tropical depression remnants occasionally bring heavy rains and winds in the south, but are rarely deadly. A notable exception was Hurricane Hazel which struck Southern Ontario centred on Toronto, in October 1954.

Samuel de Champlain reached Lake Huron in 1615, and French missionaries began to establish posts along the Great Lakes. French settlement was hampered by their hostilities with the Iroquois, who allied themselves with the British.[37] From 1634 to 1640, Hurons were devastated by European infectious diseases, such as measles and smallpox, to which they had no immunity.[38] By 1700, the Iroquois had been driven out or left the area that would become Ontario and the Mississaugas of the Ojibwa had settled the north shore of Lake Ontario. The remaining Huron settled north of Quebec. The British established trading posts on Hudson Bay in the late 17th century and began a struggle for domination of Ontario with the French. After the French of New France were defeated during the Seven Years' War, the two powers awarded nearly all of France's North American possessions (New France) to Britain in the 1763 Treaty of Paris, including those lands of Ontario not already claimed by Britain. The British annexed the Ontario region to Quebec in 1774.[39] A monument in Hamilton commemorating the United Empire Loyalists, a group of settlers who fled the United States during or after the American Revolution The first European settlements were in 1782–1784 when 5,000 United Empire Loyalists entered what is now Ontario following the American Revolution.[40] The Kingdom of Great Britain granted them 200 acres (81 ha) land and other items with which to rebuild their lives.[37] The British also set up reserves in Ontario for the Mohawks who had fought for the British and had lost their land in New York state. Other Iroquois, also displaced from New York were resettled in 1784 at the Six Nations reserve at the west end of Lake Ontario. The Mississaugas, displaced by European settlements, would later move to Six Nations also. A second wave of Americans, not all of them necessarily loyalists moved to Upper Canada after 1790 until the pre-war of 1812, many seeking available cheap land, and at the time, lower taxation. The population of Canada west of the St. Lawrence-Ottawa River confluence substantially increased during this period, a fact recognized by the Constitutional Act of 1791, which split Quebec into the Canadas: Upper Canada southwest of the St. Lawrence-Ottawa River confluence, and Lower Canada east of it. John Graves Simcoe was appointed Upper Canada's first Lieutenant governor in 1793.[41] Upper Canada[edit] Main article: Upper Canada American troops in the War of 1812 invaded Upper Canada across the Niagara River and the Detroit River, but were defeated and pushed back by the British, Canadian fencibles and militias, and First Nations warriors. However, the Americans eventually gained control of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. The 1813 Battle of York saw American troops defeat the garrison at the Upper Canada capital of York. The Americans looted the town and burned the Upper Canada Parliament Buildings during their brief occupation. The British would burn the American capital of Washington, D.C. in 1814. Depiction of the Battle of Queenston Heights, during the War of 1812. Upper Canada was an active theatre of operation during the conflict. After the War of 1812, relative stability allowed for increasing numbers of immigrants to arrive from Europe rather than from the United States. As was the case in the previous decades, this immigration shift was encouraged by the colonial leaders. Despite affordable and often free land, many arriving newcomers, mostly from Britain and Ireland, found frontier life with the harsh climate difficult, and some of those with the means eventually returned home or went south. However, population growth far exceeded emigration in the following decades. It was a mostly agrarian-based society, but canal projects and a new network of plank roads spurred greater trade within the colony and with the United States, thereby improving previously damaged relations over time. Meanwhile, Ontario's numerous waterways aided travel and transportation into the interior and supplied water power for development. As the population increased, so did the industries and transportation networks, which in turn led to further development. By the end of the century, Ontario vied with Quebec as the nation's leader in terms of growth in population, industry, arts and communications.[42] Unrest in the colony began to chafe against the aristocratic Family Compact who governed while benefiting economically from the region's resources, and who did not allow elected bodies power. This resentment spurred republican ideals and sowed the seeds for early Canadian nationalism. Accordingly, rebellion in favour of responsible government rose in both regions; Louis-Joseph Papineau led the Lower Canada Rebellion and William Lyon Mackenzie, first Toronto mayor,[43] led the Upper Canada Rebellion. In Upper Canada, the rebellion was quickly a failure. William Lyon Mackenzie escaped to the United States, where he declared the Republic of Canada on Navy Island on the Niagara River.[44] Canada West[edit] Main article: Province of Canada A map highlighting the Canadas, with Upper Canada in orange, and Lower Canada in green. In 1841, the two colonies were united to form the Province of Canada. Although both rebellions were put down in short order, the British government sent Lord Durham to investigate the causes. He recommended self-government be granted and Lower and Upper Canada be re-joined in an attempt to assimilate the French Canadians. Accordingly, the two colonies were merged into the Province of Canada by the Act of Union 1840, with the capital at Kingston, and Upper Canada becoming known as Canada West.[45] Parliamentary self-government was granted in 1848. There were heavy waves of immigration in the 1840s, and the population of Canada West more than doubled by 1851 over the previous decade. As a result, for the first time, the English-speaking population of Canada West surpassed the French-speaking population of Canada East, tilting the representative balance of power. An economic boom in the 1850s coincided with railway expansion across the province, further increasing the economic strength of Central Canada. With the repeal of the Corn Laws and a reciprocity agreement in place with the United States, various industries such as timber, mining, farming and alcohol distilling benefited tremendously. A political stalemate between the French- and English-speaking legislators, as well as fear of aggression from the United States during and immediately after the American Civil War, led the political elite to hold a series of conferences in the 1860s to effect a broader federal union of all British North American colonies. The British North America Act took effect on July 1, 1867, establishing the Dominion of Canada, initially with four provinces: Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec and Ontario. The Province of Canada was divided into Ontario and Quebec so that each linguistic group would have its own province. Both Quebec and Ontario were required by section 93 of the British North America Act to safeguard existing educational rights and privileges of the Protestant and Catholic minorities. Thus, separate Catholic schools and school boards were permitted in Ontario. However, neither province had a constitutional requirement to protect its French- or English-speaking minority. Toronto was formally established as Ontario's provincial capital. Provincehood[edit] Oliver Mowat, Premier of Ontario from 1872 to 1896 Once constituted as a province, Ontario proceeded to assert its economic and legislative power. In 1872, the lawyer Oliver Mowat became Premier of Ontario and remained as premier until 1896. He fought for provincial rights, weakening the power of the federal government in provincial matters, usually through well-argued appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. His battles with the federal government greatly decentralized Canada, giving the provinces far more power than John A. Macdonald had intended. He consolidated and expanded Ontario's educational and provincial institutions, created districts in Northern Ontario, and fought to ensure that those parts of Northwestern Ontario not historically part of Upper Canada (the vast areas north and west of the Lake Superior-Hudson Bay watershed, known as the District of Keewatin) would become part of Ontario, a victory embodied in the Canada (Ontario Boundary) Act, 1889. He also presided over the emergence of the province into the economic powerhouse of Canada. Mowat was the creator of what is often called Empire Ontario. Beginning with Macdonald's National Policy (1879) and the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway (1875–1885) through Northern Ontario and the Canadian Prairies to British Columbia, Ontario manufacturing and industry flourished. However, population increases slowed after a large recession hit the province in 1893, thus slowing growth drastically but for only a few years. Many newly arrived immigrants and others moved west along the railway to the Prairie Provinces and British Columbia, sparsely settling Northern Ontario. Mineral exploitation accelerated in the late 19th century, leading to the rise of important mining centres in the northeast, such as Sudbury, Cobalt and Timmins. The province harnessed its water power to generate hydro-electric power and created the state-controlled Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario, later Ontario Hydro. The availability of cheap electric power further facilitated the development of industry. The Ford Motor Company of Canada was established in 1904 and the McLaughlin Motor Car Company (later General Motors Canada) was founded in 1907. The motor vehicle industry became the most lucrative industry for the Ontario economy during the 20th century. In July 1912, the Conservative government of James Whitney issued Regulation 17 which severely limited the availability of French-language schooling to the province's French-speaking minority. French Canadians reacted with outrage, journalist Henri Bourassa denouncing the ""Prussians of Ontario"". The regulation was eventually repealed in 1927. Law enforcement confiscate stores of alcohol in Elk Lake in an effort to enforce prohibition. The prohibition measures were introduced in 1916 and were not repealed until 1927. Influenced by events in the United States, the government of William Hearst introduced prohibition of alcoholic drinks in 1916 with the passing of the Ontario Temperance Act. However, residents could distil and retain their own personal supply, and liquor producers could continue distillation and export for sale, allowing this already sizeable industry to strengthen further. Ontario became a hotbed for the illegal smuggling of liquor and the biggest supplier into the United States, which was under complete prohibition. Prohibition in Ontario came to an end in 1927 with the establishment of the Liquor Control Board of Ontario under the government of Howard Ferguson. The sale and consumption of liquor, wine, and beer are still controlled by some of the most extreme laws in North America to ensure strict community standards and revenue generation from the alcohol retail monopoly are upheld. The post-World War II period was one of exceptional prosperity and growth. Ontario has been the recipients of most immigration to Canada, largely immigrants from war-torn Europe in the 1950s and 1960s and following changes in federal immigration law, a massive influx of non-Europeans since the 1970s. From a largely ethnically British province, Ontario has rapidly become culturally very diverse. A monument commemorating the immigrant family in Toronto. The province saw a large number of migrants settle in Ontario in the decades following World War II. The nationalist movement in Quebec, particularly after the election of the Parti Québécois in 1976, contributed to driving many businesses and English-speaking people out of Quebec to Ontario, and as a result, Toronto surpassed Montreal as the largest city and economic centre of Canada.[46] Depressed economic conditions in the Maritime Provinces have also resulted in de-population of those provinces in the 20th century, with heavy migration into Ontario.[47][48] Ontario's official language is English, although there exists a number of French-speaking communities across Ontario.[49] French-language services are made available for communities with a sizeable French-speaking population; a service that is ensured under the French Language Services Act of 1989. Territorial evolution[edit] Until 1763, most of Ontario was considered part of New France by French claim. Rupert's Land, defined as the drainage basin of Hudson Bay, was claimed by Britain, and included much of today's Northern Ontario. The British defeated the armies of the French colony and its indigenous allies in the French and Indian War, part of the Seven Years' War global conflict. Concluding the war, the peace treaty between the European powers, known as the Treaty of Paris 1763, assigned almost all of France's possessions in North America to Britain, including parts that would later become Ontario not already part of Rupert's Land. Britain established the first Province of Quebec, encompassing contemporary Quebec and southern Ontario. After the American War of Independence, the first reserves for First Nations were established. These are situated at Six Nations (1784), Tyendinaga (1793) and Akwesasne (1795). Six Nations and Tyendinaga were established by the British for those indigenous groups who had fought on the side of the British, and were expelled from the new United States. Akwesasne was a pre-existing Mohawk community and its borders were formalized under the 1795 Jay Treaty. In 1788, while part of the Province of Quebec, southern Ontario was divided into four districts: Hesse, Lunenburg, Mecklenburg, and Nassau. In 1792, the four districts were renamed: Hesse became the Western District, Lunenburg became the Eastern District, Mecklenburg became the Midland District, and Nassau became the Home District. Counties were created within the districts. By 1798, there were eight districts: Eastern, Home, Johnstown, London, Midland, Newcastle, Niagara, and Western. By 1826, there were eleven districts: Bathurst, Eastern, Gore, Home, Johnstown, London, Midland, Newcastle, Niagara, Ottawa, and Western. By 1838, there were twenty districts: Bathurst, Brock, Colbourne, Dalhousie, Eastern, Gore, Home, Huron, Johnstown, London, Midland, Newcastle, Niagara, Ottawa, Prince Edward, Simcoe, Talbot, Victoria, Wellington, and Western. In 1849, the districts of southern Ontario were abolished by the Province of Canada, and county governments took over certain municipal responsibilities. The Province of Canada also began creating districts in sparsely populated Northern Ontario with the establishment of Algoma District and Nipissing District in 1858. Evolution of the borders of Ontario since Canadian Confederation in 1867 The borders of Ontario, its new name in 1867, were provisionally expanded north and west. When the Province of Canada was formed, its borders were not entirely clear, and Ontario claimed eventually to reach all the way to the Rocky Mountains and Arctic Ocean. With Canada's acquisition of Rupert's Land, Ontario was interested in clearly defining its borders, especially since some of the new areas in which it was interested were rapidly growing. After the federal government asked Ontario to pay for construction in the new disputed area, the province asked for an elaboration on its limits, and its boundary was moved north to the 51st parallel north.[50] The northern and western boundaries of Ontario were in dispute after Canadian Confederation. Ontario's right to Northwestern Ontario was determined by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in 1884 and confirmed by the Canada (Ontario Boundary) Act, 1889 of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. By 1899, there were seven northern districts: Algoma, Manitoulin, Muskoka, Nipissing, Parry Sound, Rainy River, and Thunder Bay. Four more northern districts were created between 1907 and 1912: Cochrane, Kenora, Sudbury and Timiskaming.[51] Demographics[edit] Main article: Demographics of Ontario Population density of Ontario Historical populationsYearPop.±%1851952,004—    18611,396,091+46.6%18711,620,851+16.1%18811,926,922+18.9%18912,114,321+9.7%19012,182,947+3.2%19112,527,292+15.8%19212,933,662+16.1%19313,431,683+17.0%19413,787,655+10.4%19514,597,542+21.4%19565,404,933+17.6%19616,236,092+15.4%19666,960,870+11.6%19717,703,105+10.7%19768,264,465+7.3%19818,625,107+4.4%19869,101,695+5.5%199110,084,885+10.8%199610,753,573+6.6%200111,410,046+6.1%200612,160,282+6.6%201112,851,821+5.7%201613,448,494+4.6%Source: Statistics Canada In the 2016 census, Ontario had a population of 13,448,494 living in 5,169,174 of its 5,598,391 total dwellings, a 4.6 percent change from its 2011 population of 12,851,821. With a land area of 908,607.67 km2 (350,815.38 sq mi), it had a population density of 14.8/km2 (38.3/sq mi) in 2016.[52] The largest population centres in Ontario are Toronto, Ottawa, Hamilton, Kitchener, London and Oshawa which all have more than 300,000 inhabitants. The percentages given below add to more than 100 per cent because of dual responses (e.g., ""French and Canadian"" response generates an entry both in the category ""French Canadian"" and in the category ""Canadian""). The majority of Ontarians are of English or other European descent including large Scottish, Irish and Italian communities. Slightly less than 5 per cent of the population of Ontario is Franco-Ontarian, that is those whose native tongue is French, although those with French ancestry account for 11 per cent of the population. In relation to natural increase or inter-provincial migration, immigration is a huge population growth force in Ontario, as it has been over the last two centuries. More recent sources of immigrants with large or growing communities in Ontario include South Asians, Caribbeans, Latin Americans, Europeans, Asians, and Africans. Most populations have settled in the larger urban centres. In 2011, 25.9 per cent of the population consisted of visible minorities and 2.4 per cent of the population was Indigenous, mostly of First Nations and Métis descent. There was also a small number of Inuit people in the province. The number of Aboriginal people and visible minorities has been increasing at a faster rate than the general population of Ontario.[53] Religion[edit] In 2011, the largest religious denominations in Ontario were the Roman Catholic Church (with 31.4% of the population), the United Church of Canada (7.5%), and the Anglican Church (6.1%). 23.1% of Ontarians had no religious affiliation, making it the second-largest religious grouping in the province after Roman Catholics.[54] The major religious groups in Ontario in 2011 were: Religion People % Total 12,651,795 100 Catholic 3,976,610 31.4 No religious affiliation 2,927,790 23.1 Protestant 2,668,665 21.1 Other Christians 1,224,300 9.7 Muslim 581,950 4.6 Hindu 366,720 2.9 Christian Orthodox 297,710 2.4 Jewish 195,540 1.5 Sikh 179,765 1.4 Buddhist 163,750 1.3 Other religions 68,985 0.5 In Ontario, Catholics are represented by the Assembly of Catholic Bishops of Ontario[55] and the Anglican Protestants by the Ecclesiastical Province of Ontario.[56] The Ecclesiastical Province covers most of the geographical province of Ontario[56] Language[edit] See also: Franco-Ontarian English and French displayed on a gantry sign. Communities with sizeable Francophone populations are able to receive provincial services in French. The principal language of Ontario is English, the province's de facto official language,[57] with approximately 97.2 per cent of Ontarians having proficiency in the language, although only 69.5 per cent of Ontarians reported English as their mother tongue in the 2016 Census.[58] English is one of two official languages of Canada, with the other being French. English and French are the official languages of the courts in Ontario. Approximately 4.6 per cent of the population were identified as francophones,[59][note 1] with 11.5 per cent of Ontarians having proficiency in French.[58] Approximately 11.2 per cent of Ontarians reported being bilingual in both official languages of Canada.[58] Approximately 2.5 per cent of Ontarians have no proficiency in either English or French.[58] Franco-Ontarians are concentrated in the northeastern, eastern, and extreme Southern parts of the province, where under the French Language Services Act,[60] provincial government services are required to be available in French if at least 10 per cent of a designated area's population report French as their native language or if an urban centre has at least 5,000 francophones. Other languages spoken by residents include Arabic, Bengali, Cantonese, Dutch, German, Greek, Gujarati, Hindi, Hebrew, Italian, Korean, Malayalam, Mandarin, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Punjabi, Russian, Sinhalese, Somali, Spanish, Tagalog, Telugu, Tamil, Tibetan, Ukrainian, Urdu, and Vietnamese.[61] Economy[edit] Main article: Economy of Ontario Ontario is Canada's leading manufacturing province, accounting for 52% of the total national manufacturing shipments in 2004.[62] Ontario's largest trading partner is the American state of Michigan. As of April 2012[update], Moody's bond-rating agency rated Ontario debt at AA2/stable,[63] while S&P rated it AA-.[64] Dominion Bond Rating Service rated it AA(low) in January 2013.[65] Long known as a bastion of Canadian manufacturing and financial solvency, Ontario's public debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to be 38.4% in fiscal year 2023–2024.[66] Container ship at Algoma Steel. The Great Lakes provide ocean access for industries in the province's interior. Mining and the forest products industry, notably pulp and paper, are vital to the economy of Northern Ontario. As of 2011, roughly 200,000 ha are clearcut each year; herbicides for hardwood suppression are applied to a third of the total.[67] There has been controversy over the Ring of Fire mineral deposit, and whether the province can afford to spend CAD$2.25 billion on a road from the Trans-Canada Highway near Kenora to the deposit, currently valued at CAD$60 billion.[68] An abundance of natural resources, excellent transportation links to the North American heartland and the inland Great Lakes making ocean access possible via container ships, have all contributed to making manufacturing the principal industry of the province, found mainly in the Golden Horseshoe region, which is the largest industrialized area in Canada, the southern end of the region being part of the North American Rust Belt. Important products include motor vehicles, iron, steel, food, electrical appliances, machinery, chemicals, and paper. Hamilton is the largest steel manufacturing city in Canada followed closely by Sault Ste. Marie, and Sarnia is the centre for petrochemical production. Construction employed more than 6.5% of the province's work force in June 2011.[69] Ontario's steel industry was once centred in Hamilton. Hamilton harbour, which can be seen from the QEW Skyway bridge, is an industrial wasteland; U.S. Steel-owned Stelco announced in the autumn of 2013 that it would close in 2014, with the loss of 875 jobs. The move flummoxed a union representative, who seemed puzzled why a plant with capacity of 2 million tons per annum would be shut while Canada imported 8 million tons of steel the previous year.[70] Algoma Steel maintains a plant in Sault Ste Marie. A worker at the Oakville Assembly installs a battery in an automobile. The automotive industry is a contributor to the economy of Ontario. Ontario surpassed Michigan in car production, assembling 2.696 million vehicles in 2004. Ontario has Chrysler plants in Windsor and Bramalea, two GM plants in Oshawa and one in Ingersoll, a Honda assembly plant in Alliston, Ford plants in Oakville and St. Thomas and Toyota assembly plants in Cambridge and Woodstock. However, as a result of steeply declining sales, in 2005, General Motors announced massive layoffs at production facilities across North America, including two large GM plants in Oshawa and a drive train facility in St. Catharines, that resulted in 8,000 job losses in Ontario alone. In 2006, Ford Motor Company announced between 25,000 and 30,000 layoffs phased until 2012; Ontario was spared the worst, but job losses were announced for the St Thomas facility and the Windsor Casting plant. However, these losses will be offset by Ford's recent announcement of a hybrid vehicle facility slated to begin production in 2007 at its Oakville plant and GM's re-introduction of the Camaro which will be produced in Oshawa. On December 4, 2008, Toyota announced the grand opening of the RAV4 plant in Woodstock,[71] and Honda also plans to add an engine plant at its facility in Alliston. Despite these new plants coming online, Ontario has not yet fully recovered following massive layoffs caused by the global recession; its unemployment rate was 7.3% in May 2013,[72] compared to 8.7 percent in January 2010[73] and approximately 6% in 2007. In September 2013, the Ontario government committed CAD$70.9 million to the Ford plant in Oakville, while the federal government committed CAD$71.1mn, to secure 2,800 jobs.[74] The province has lost 300,000 manufacturing jobs in the decade from 2003, and the Bank of Canada noted that ""while the energy and mining industries have benefitted from these movements, the pressure on the manufacturing sector has intensified, since many firms in this sector were already dealing with growing competition from low-cost economies such as China.""[75][76] Toronto's Financial District serves as the centre for Canada's financial services. Toronto, the capital of Ontario, is the centre of Canada's financial services and banking industry. Neighbouring cities are home to product distribution, IT centres, and manufacturing industries. Canada's Federal Government is the largest single employer in the National Capital Region, which centres on the border cities of Ontario's Ottawa and Quebec's Gatineau.[77][78] The information technology sector is important, particularly in the Silicon Valley North section of Ottawa, home to Canada's largest technology park.[79] IT is also important in the Waterloo Region, where the headquarters of BlackBerry is located.[80] Tourism contributes heavily to the economy of Central Ontario, peaking during the summer months owing to the abundance of fresh water recreation and wilderness found there in reasonable proximity to the major urban centres. At other times of the year, hunting, skiing and snowmobiling are popular. This region has some of the most vibrant fall colour displays anywhere on the continent, and tours directed at overseas visitors are organized to see them. Tourism also plays a key role in border cities with large casinos, among them Windsor, Cornwall, Sarnia and Niagara Falls, the latter of which attracts millions of US and other international visitors.[81] Agriculture[edit] Aerial view of farms in Waterloo. A significant portion of the land in Southern Ontario is used as farmland. Once the dominant industry, agriculture now uses a small percentage of the workforce. However, much of the land in southern Ontario is given over to agriculture. As the following table shows, while the number of individual farms has steadily decreased and their overall size has shrunk at a lower rate, greater mechanization has supported increased supply to satisfy the ever-increasing demands of a growing population base; this has also meant a gradual increase in the total amount of land used for growing crops. Ontario Farming 1986 1991 1996 2001 2006 Number of Farms 72,713 68,633 67,520 59,728 57,211 Total Hectares 5,646,582 5,451,379 5,616,860 5,466,233 5,386,453 Acres 13,953,009 13,470,652 13,879,565 13,507,358 13,310,217 Planted Crops Hectares 3,457,966 3,411,667 3,544,927 3,656,705 3,660,941 Acres 8,544,821 8,430,438 8,759,707 9,035,916 9,046,383 Source: Statistics Canada, Census of Agriculture.[82] vte Grapevines growing in Prince Edward County, a wine-growing region Common types of farms reported in the 2001 census include those for cattle, small grains and dairy. The fruit- and wine industry is primarily on the Niagara Peninsula, Prince Edward County, and along the northern shore of Lake Erie, where tobacco farms are also situated. Market vegetables grow in the rich soils of the Holland Marsh near Newmarket. The area near Windsor is also very fertile. The Heinz plant in Leamington was taken over in these autumn of 2013 by Warren Buffett and a Brazilian partner, following which it put 740 people out of work.[83] Government subsidies followed shortly; Premier Kathleen Wynne offered CAD$200,000 to cushion the blow, and promised that another processed-food operator would soon be found.[84] On December 10, 2013, Kellogg's announced layoffs for more than 509 workers at a cereal manufacture plant in London.[85] The area defined as the Corn Belt covers much of the southwestern area of the province, extending as far north as close to Goderich, but corn and soy are grown throughout the southern portion of the province. Apple orchards are a common sight along the southern shore of Nottawasaga Bay (part of Georgian Bay) near Collingwood and along the northern shore of Lake Ontario near Cobourg. Tobacco production, centred in Norfolk County, has decreased, allowing an increase in alternative crops such as hazelnuts and ginseng. The Ontario origins of Massey Ferguson, once one of the largest farm-implement manufacturers in the world, indicate the importance agriculture once[citation needed] had to the Canadian economy. A sign marking the Ottawa Greenbelt, an initiative to protect farmland and limit urban sprawl Southern Ontario's limited supply of agricultural land is going out of production at an increasing rate. Urban sprawl and farmland severances contribute to the loss of thousands of acres of productive agricultural land in Ontario each year. Over 2,000 farms and 150,000 acres (61,000 ha) of farmland in the GTA alone were lost to production in the two decades between 1976 and 1996. This loss represented approximately 18%"". of Ontario's Class 1 farmland being converted to urban purposes. In addition, increasing rural severances provide ever-greater interference with agricultural production.[86] In an effort to protect the farmland and green spaces of the National Capital Region, and Greater Toronto Area, the Federal[87] and Provincial Governments introduced greenbelts around Ottawa[88] and the Golden Horseshoe, limiting urban development in these areas.[89] Energy[edit] See also: Energy policy of Canada, Renewable energy in Canada, and Smart grid Ontario's rivers make it rich in hydroelectric energy.[90] In 2009, Ontario Power Generation generated 70 percent of the province's electricity, of which 51 percent is nuclear, 39% is hydroelectric and 10% is fossil-fuel derived.[91] By 2025, nuclear power is projected to supply 42%, while fossil-fuel-derived generation is projected to decrease slightly over the next 20 years.[92] Much of the newer power generation coming online in the last few years is natural gas or combined-cycle natural gas plants. OPG is not, however, responsible for the transmission of power, which is under the control of Hydro One. The Pickering Nuclear Generating Station is one of three nuclear power stations in Ontario. Despite its diverse range of power options, problems related to increasing consumption, lack of energy efficiency and aging nuclear reactors, Ontario has been forced in recent years to purchase power from its neighbours Quebec and Michigan to supplement its power needs during peak consumption periods. Ontario's basic domestic rate in 2010 was 11.17 cents per kWh; by contrast. Quebec's was 6.81.[93] In December 2013, the government projected a 42 percent hike by 2018, and 68 percent by 2033.[92] Industrial rates are projected to rise by 33% by 2018, and 55% in 2033.[92] The Green Energy and Green Economy Act, 2009 (GEA), takes a two-pronged approach to commercializing renewable energy; first, it aims to bring more renewable energy sources to the province; and secondly, it aims to adopt more energy-efficiency measures to help conserve energy. The bill envisaged appointing a Renewable Energy Facilitator to provide ""one-window"" assistance and support to project developers to facilitate project approvals.[94] The approvals process for transmission projects would also be streamlined and (for the first time in Ontario) the bill would enact standards for renewable energy projects. Homeowners would have access to incentives to develop small-scale renewables such as low- or no-interest loans to finance the capital cost of renewable energy generating facilities like solar panels.[94] The Sir Adam Beck Hydroelectric Generating Stations are hydroelectric plants located in Niagara Falls. Ontario is home to Niagara Falls, which supplies a large amount of electricity to the province. The Bruce Nuclear Generating Station, the largest operational nuclear power plant in the world, is also in Ontario and uses 8 CANDU reactors to generate electricity for the province. Ontario had the most wind energy capacity of the country with 4,900 MW of power (41% of Canada's capacity).[95] Government, law and politics[edit] Further information: Monarchy in Ontario, Executive Council of Ontario, and Local government in Ontario The British North America Act 1867 section 69 stipulated ""There shall be a Legislature for Ontario consisting of the Lieutenant Governor and of One House, styled the Legislative Assembly of Ontario."" The assembly currently has 124 seats (increased from 107 as of the 42nd Ontario general election) representing ridings elected in a first-past-the-post system across the province. The legislative buildings at Queen's Park are the seat of government. Following the Westminster system, the leader of the party holding the most seats in the assembly is known as the ""Premier and President of the Council"" (Executive Council Act R.S.O. 1990). The Premier chooses the cabinet or Executive Council whose members are deemed ministers of the Crown. Although the Legislative Assembly Act (R.S.O. 1990) refers to ""members of the assembly"", the legislators are now commonly called MPPs (Members of the Provincial Parliament) in English and députés de l'Assemblée législative in French, but they have also been called MLAs (Members of the Legislative Assembly), and both are acceptable. The title of Prime Minister of Ontario, correct in French (le Premier ministre), is permissible in English but now generally avoided in favour of the title ""Premier"" to avoid confusion with the Prime Minister of Canada. Law[edit] Osgoode Hall houses the Court of Appeal for Ontario, the appellate court for the province. Ontario has grown, from its roots in Upper Canada, into a modern jurisdiction. The old titles of the chief law officers, the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General, remain in use. They both are responsible to the Legislature. The Attorney-General drafts the laws and is responsible for criminal prosecutions and the administration of justice, while the Solicitor-General is responsible for law enforcement and the police services of the province. The Municipal Act, 2001 (Ontario)[96] is the main statute governing the creation, administration and government of municipalities in the Canadian province of Ontario, other than the City of Toronto. After being passed in 2001, it came into force on January 1, 2003, replacing the previous Municipal Act.[97] Effective January 1, 2007, the Municipal Act, 2001 (the Act) was significantly amended by the Municipal Statute Law Amendment Act, 2006 (Bill 130).[98][99] Politics[edit] Main article: Politics of Ontario The Ontario Legislative Building at Queen's Park. The building serves as the meeting place for the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. Ontario has numerous political parties which run for election. The four main parties are the centre-right Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario, the social democratic Ontario New Democratic Party (NDP), the centre to centre-left Ontario Liberal Party, and Green Party of Ontario. The Progressive Conservatives, Liberals and New Democrats have each governed the province, while the Greens elected their first member to the Legislative Assembly in 2018. The 2018 provincial election resulted in a Progressive Conservative majority government under party leader Doug Ford, who was sworn in as Premier on June 29. Ontario NDP leader Andrea Horwath was sworn in as the leader of her Majesty's Loyal Opposition. Administrative divisions[edit] Map of the counties, regional municipalities, districts, and municipalities of Ontario. Ontario has three types of first-level administrative divisions. They include single-tier municipalities, upper-tier municipalities (which may be in the form of either regional municipalities or counties), and districts. Upper-tier municipalities and districts are made up of smaller municipalities and other types of administrative divisions. Administrative divisions differ primarily in the services that they provide to their residents, with the differing structures of these administrative regions resulting in disparities among Ontario's different regions. The administrative regions of Ontario are roughly coterminous with the census divisions used by Statistics Canada, although some exceptions do exist.[note 2] Urban areas[edit] See also: Golden Horseshoe, National Capital Region (Canada), and Detroit–Windsor Statistics Canada's measure of a ""metro area"", the Census Metropolitan Area (CMA), roughly bundles together population figures from the core municipality with those from ""commuter"" municipalities.[100] CMA (largest other included municipalities in brackets) 2001 2006 2011 2016 % Change Toronto CMA (Mississauga, Brampton) 4,682,897 5,113,149 5,583,064 5,928,040 6.2 Ottawa CMA (Gatineau, Clarence-Rockland) 1,067,800 1,130,761 1,254,919 1,323,783 4.4 Hamilton CMA (Burlington, Grimsby) 662,401 692,911 721,053 747,545 3.7 Kitchener CMA (Cambridge, Waterloo) 414,284 451,235 496,383 523,894 5.5 London CMA (St. Thomas, Strathroy-Caradoc) 435,600 457,720 474,786 494,069 4.1 St. Catharines CMA (Niagara Falls, Welland) 377,009 390,317 392,184 406,074 3.5 Oshawa CMA (Whitby, Clarington) 296,298 330,594 356,177 379,848 6.6 Windsor CMA (Lakeshore, LaSalle) 307,877 323,342 319,246 329,144 3.1 Barrie CMA (Innisfil, Springwater) 148,480 177,061 187,013 197,059 5.4 Sudbury CMA (Whitefish Lake, Wanapitei Reserve) 155,601 158,258 160,770 164,689 1.0 Kingston CMA 146,838 152,358 159,561 161,175 1.0 *Parts of Quebec (including Gatineau) are included in the Ottawa CMA.

Publicly funded elementary and secondary schools are administered by the Ontario Ministry of Education, while colleges and universities are administered by the Ontario Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities. The Minister of Education is Stephen Lecce, the Minister of Colleges and Universities is Ross Romano, and the Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development Monte McNaughton. Higher education[edit] Main article: Higher education in Ontario See also: List of colleges in Ontario and List of universities in Ontario Higher education in Ontario includes postsecondary education and skills training regulated by the Ministry of Training, Colleges, and Universities and provided by universities, colleges of applied arts and technology, and private career colleges.[102] The minister is Merrilee Fullerton. The ministry administers laws covering 22 public universities,[103] 24 public colleges (21 Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology (CAATs) and three Institutes of Technology and Advanced Learning (ITALs)),[104] 17 privately funded religious universities,[105] and over 500 private career colleges.[106] The Canadian constitution provides each province with the responsibility for higher education and there is no corresponding national federal ministry of higher education.[107] Within Canadian federalism the division of responsibilities and taxing powers between the Ontario and Canadian governments creates the need for co-operation to fund and deliver higher education to students. Each higher education system aims to improve participation, access, and mobility for students. There are two central organizations that assist with the process of applying to Ontario universities and colleges: the Ontario Universities' Application Centre and Ontario College Application Service. While application services are centralized, admission and selection processes vary and are the purview of each institution. Admission to many Ontario postsecondary institutions can be highly competitive. Upon admission, students may get involved with regional student representation with the Canadian Federation of Students, the Canadian Alliance of Student Associations, the Ontario Undergraduate Student Alliance, or through the College Student Alliance in Ontario. Culture[edit] This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (January 2021) In 2019, the government of Ontario passed legislation that established the Poet Laureate of Ontario.[108] Songs and slogans[edit] An Ontario licence plate with the slogan Yours to Discover at the bottom of the plate In 1973, the first slogan to appear on licence plates in Ontario was ""Keep It Beautiful"". This was replaced by ""Yours to Discover"" in 1982,[109] apparently inspired by a tourism slogan, ""Discover Ontario"", dating back to 1927.[110] Plates with the French equivalent, Tant à découvrir, were made available to the public beginning in May 2008.[111] (From 1988 to 1990,[112] ""Ontario Incredible""[113] gave ""Yours to Discover"" a brief respite.) A Place to Stand, a Place to Grow is a song commissioned by the government of Ontario for its pavilion in Expo 67, and an unofficial anthem of the province.[114] As a part of the Canada 150 celebrations in 2017, the provincial government unveiled an ""updated,"" rendition of the song.[114] In 2007, the provincial tourism agency commissioned a new song, ""There's No Place Like This"" is featured in television advertising, performed by Ontario artists including Molly Johnson, Brian Byrne, Keshia Chanté,[115] as well as Tomi Swick and Arkells. Professional sports[edit] The province has professional sports teams in baseball, basketball, Canadian football, ice hockey, lacrosse, rugby league, rugby union and soccer.

Ontario has two major east–west routes, both starting from Montreal in the neighbouring province of Quebec. The northerly route, which was a major fur trade route, travels west from Montreal along the Ottawa River, then continues northwestward towards Manitoba. Major cities on or near the route include Ottawa, North Bay, Sudbury, Sault Ste. Marie, and Thunder Bay. The southerly route, which was driven by growth in settlements originated by the United Empire Loyalists and later other European immigrants, travels southwest from Montreal along the St. Lawrence River, Lake Ontario, and Lake Erie before entering the United States in Michigan. Major cities on or near the route include Kingston, Belleville, Peterborough, Oshawa, Toronto, Mississauga, Kitchener-Waterloo, Hamilton, London, Sarnia, and Windsor. This route was also heavily used by immigrants to the Midwestern US particularly in the late 19th century. Air travel[edit] Thunder Bay International Airport is one of five international airports operating in Ontario. Important airports in the province include Toronto Pearson International Airport, which is the busiest airport in Canada,[116] handling nearly 50 million passengers in 2018.[117] Ottawa Macdonald–Cartier International Airport is Ontario's second largest airport. Toronto/Pearson and Ottawa/Macdonald-Cartier form two of the three points in Canada's busiest set of air routes (the third point being Montréal–Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport). In addition to airports in Ottawa, and Toronto, the province also operates three other international airports, the John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport in Hamilton, the Thunder Bay International Airport in Thunder Bay and the London International Airport in London. John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport serves as cargo hub, reliever for Pearson, and a hub for ULCC Swoop. Most Ontario cities have regional airports, many of which have scheduled commuter flights from Air Canada Jazz or smaller airlines and charter companies – flights from the mid-size cities such as Thunder Bay, Sault Ste. Marie, Sudbury, North Bay, Timmins, Windsor, London, and Kingston feed directly into larger airports in Toronto and Ottawa. Bearskin Airlines also runs flights along the northerly east–west route, connecting Ottawa, North Bay, Sudbury, Sault Ste. Marie, Kitchener and Thunder Bay directly. Isolated towns and settlements in the northern areas of the province rely partly or entirely on air service for travel, goods, and even ambulance services (MEDIVAC), since much of the far northern area of the province cannot be reached by road or rail. Railways[edit] Via Rail operates the inter-regional passenger train service on the Quebec City–Windsor Corridor, along with The Canadian, a transcontinental rail service from Southern Ontario to Vancouver, and the Sudbury–White River train. Additionally, Amtrak rail connects Ontario with key New York cities including Buffalo, Albany, and New York City. Ontario Northland provides rail service to destinations as far north as Moosonee near James Bay, connecting them with the south. Freight rail is dominated by the founding cross-country Canadian National Railway and CP Rail companies, which during the 1990s sold many short rail lines from their vast network to private companies operating mostly in the south. Regional commuter rail is limited to the provincially owned GO Transit, and serves a train-bus network spanning the Golden Horseshoe region, with Union Station in Toronto serving as the transport hub.[118][119] There are several city rail-transit systems in the Province. The Toronto Transit Commission operates subways, as well as streetcars (being one of the busiest streetcar systems in North America). OC Transpo operates a light rail metro system in Ottawa.[120] In addition, Waterloo region operates a surface light rail system.[121] Plans to build a light rail line is also underway in the Regional Municipality of Peel.[122][123] Ontario Northland freight train crossing the Missinaibi River at Mattice-Val Côté in Northern Ontario Roads[edit] Main article: Roads in Ontario Highway 400 in Seguin. The roadway forms a part of the province's 400-series highways. 400-series highways make up the primary vehicular network in the south of province, and they connect at a number of points to border crossings to the United States, and Quebec, the busiest being the Detroit–Windsor Tunnel and Ambassador Bridge and the Blue Water Bridge (via Highway 402). Some of the primary highways along the southern route are Highway 401, Highway 417, and Highway 400,[124][125] Highway 401 being the busiest highway in North America. Other provincial highways and regional roads inter-connect the remainder of the province. Waterways[edit] See also: Boat building industry in Ontario The Saint Lawrence Seaway, which extends across most of the southern portion of the province and connects to the Atlantic Ocean, is the primary water transportation route for cargo, particularly iron ore and grain. In the past, the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River were also a major passenger transportation route, but over the past half century passenger travel has been reduced to ferry services and sightseeing cruises. Ontario's three largest ports are the Port of Hamilton, Port of Thunder Bay and the Port of Windsor. Ontario's only saltwater port is located in the town of Moosonee on James Bay.

There would otherwise be 51 census divisions instead of the 49 official ones used by Statistics Canada.

It was founded in 1791 and is among the oldest universities in the United States as it was the fifth institution of higher education established in the New England region of the U.S. northeast.[6] It is also listed as one of the original eight ""Public Ivy"" institutions in the United States. It is classified among ""R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity"".[7] The university's Dudley H. Davis Center was the first student center in the United States to receive a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold certification.[8] The largest hospital complex in Vermont, the University of Vermont Medical Center, has its primary facility on the UVM campus and is affiliated with the Robert Larner College of Medicine.

The university enrolled its first students 10 years later. Its first president, The Rev. Daniel C. Sanders, was hired in 1800, and served as the sole faculty member for seven years. Instruction began in 1801, and the first class graduated in 1804. In 1865, the university merged with Vermont Agricultural College (chartered November 22, 1864, after the passage of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act), emerging as the University of Vermont and State Agricultural College. The university was granted 150,000 acres, which it sold for $122,626.[9] The University of Vermont draws 6.8 percent of its annual budget of about $600 million from the State of Vermont and Vermont residents make up 35 percent of enrollment, while 65 percent of students come from elsewhere.[10] Much of the initial funding and planning for the university was undertaken by Ira Allen, who is honored as UVM's founder. Allen donated a 50-acre (20 ha) parcel of land for establishment of the university. Most of this land has been maintained as the university's main green, where stands a statue of Allen.[11] The Billings Memorial Library was built in 1883 and was the university's library until 1961 when the larger Guy W. Bailey library was built. Since then, it has served miscellaneous purposes. The citizens of Burlington helped fund the university's first edifice, and, when it was destroyed by fire in 1824, also paid for its replacement. This building came to be known as ""Old Mill"" for its resemblance to New England mills of the time. The Marquis de Lafayette, a French general who became a commander in the American Revolution, toured all 24 U.S. states in 1824-1825 and while in Vermont laid the cornerstone of Old Mill, which stands on University Row, along with Ira Allen Chapel, Billings Library, Williams Hall, Royall Tyler Theatre and Morrill Hall. A statue of Lafayette stands at the north end of the main green.[11] The University of Vermont was the first American college or university with a charter declaring that the ""rules, regulations, and by-laws shall not tend to give preference to any religious sect or denomination whatsoever.""[11] In 1871, UVM defied custom and admitted two women as students. Four years later, it was the first American university to admit women to full membership into the Phi Beta Kappa Society, the country's oldest collegiate academic honor society. Likewise, in 1877, it initiated the first African American into the society.[11] Named for U.S. Senator Justin Smith Morrill, Morrill Hall was constructed in 1906–07 to serve as the home of the UVM Agriculture Department and the Agricultural Experiment Station. Justin Smith Morrill, a U.S. Representative (1855-1867) and Senator (1867-1898) from Vermont, author of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act that created federal funding for establishing the U.S. Land-Grant colleges and universities, served as a trustee of the university from 1865 to 1898. In 1924, the first radio broadcast in Vermont occurred from the college station, WCAX, run by students then, now the call sign of a commercial television station.[12] For 73 years, until 1969, UVM held an annual ""Kake Walk” where students wore blackface.[13][14] Seal[edit] The university first adopted an official seal in 1807. The seal depicts the sun rising over the Green Mountains with the original college edifice, now the remodeled Old Mill. It includes a diagram of Euclid's ""windmill proof"" of the Pythagorean Theorem, a globe, and a sextant. It includes the motto ""Universitas V. Montis. A.D. 1791"" in the outer ring ""Collegiumque Agriculturae"" in the inner one, noting the establishment of the College of Agriculture in 1865.[15] Academics[edit] UVM research vessel docked near ECHO Aquarium, in Burlington harbor along Lake Champlain. The University of Vermont comprises seven undergraduate schools, an honors college, a graduate college, and a college of medicine. The Honors College does not offer its own degrees; students in the Honors College concurrently enroll in one of the university's seven undergraduate colleges or schools.[16] Bachelors, masters, and doctoral programs are offered through the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, the College of Arts and Sciences, the College of Education and Social Services, the College of Engineering and Mathematical Sciences, the College of Medicine, the College of Nursing and Health Sciences, the Graduate College, the Grossman School of Business, and the Rubenstein School of Environment and Natural Resources.[17] The University of Vermont is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education.[18] Rankings[edit] Academic rankings National ARWU[19] 95–114 Forbes[20] 168 THE/WSJ[21] 283 U.S. News & World Report[22] 118 Washington Monthly[23] 145 Global ARWU[24] 301–400 QS[25] 651–700 U.S. News & World Report[26] 477 UVM is ranked tied for 118th in U.S. News & World Report's 2021 national university rankings, and is ranked tied for 54th among public universities.[27] In 2019, Forbes ""America's Top Colleges"" list ranks UVM 168th overall out of 650 private and public colleges and universities in America, and also ranks it 48th in the ""Public Colleges"" category and 91st among ""Research Universities.""[28] The University of Vermont is ranked 40th on a list published by BusinessWeek.com of the top 50 U.S. colleges and universities whose bachelor's degree graduates earn the highest salaries.[29] In 2014, an analysis of federal data found The University of Vermont to be among the top ten schools in the United States with the highest total rape reports. There were 27 total rape reports on their main campus.[30] Williams Hall (formerly Williams Science Hall) at the University of Vermont today houses the departments of Fine Arts and Anthropology. College of Arts and Sciences[edit] The College of Arts and Sciences is the largest of UVM's schools and colleges and has the largest number of students, faculty, and staff. The college also offers the bulk of the foundational courses to help ensure that students all over campus have the tools to succeed in all academic endeavors. It offers 45 areas of study in the humanities, fine arts, social sciences, mathematics, natural sciences, and physical sciences. Grossman School of Business[edit] UVM's Grossman School of Business is accredited by the AACSB International and offers undergraduate and graduate programs.[31] The school was renamed the Grossman School of Business in 2015 in honor of a $20 million gift from alumnus Steven Grossman, the largest single gift in the university's history.[32] In 2016, the Grossman School was ranked the No. 10 MBA program in the world for social and environmental impact by Corporate Knights Magazine.[33] College of Engineering and Mathematical Sciences[edit] CEMS is home to four ABET-accredited engineering programs—Civil, Environmental, Electrical and Mechanical—as well as a new degree in Biomedical engineering in addition to the Department of Computer Science and the Department of Mathematics and Statistics. It also features three research centers: the Transportation Research Center, the Complex Systems Center and the Vermont Advanced Computing Center. The college has about 1250 undergraduate students, 200 graduate students, and 85 faculty members. College of Agriculture and Life Sciences[edit] The College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS) offers programs in animal science (early admission to the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University is available); biochemistry; biological science; community entrepreneurship; community and international development; dietetics, nutrition and food sciences; ecological agriculture; environmental science; environmental studies; microbiology; molecular genetics; plant biology; public communication; and sustainable landscape horticulture. The college is also home to the Center for Rural Studies. The college also offers programs in conjunction with the college of arts and sciences. Students who choose these majors, such as Biological Sciences, can choose between either college.[34] As a land grant college, UVM receives an annual grant under the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service to provide agricultural research services to the state of Vermont. College of Education and Social Services[edit] UVM's College of Education and Social Services (CESS) offers degrees in teacher education, human development & family studies, and social work. Minors are also available in American Sign Language, special education, and education for cultural and linguistic diversity. The college comprises the Department of Leadership and Developmental Sciences, Department of Education, Department of Social Work, and the Center on Disability and Community Inclusion. Studies leading to a master's degree or doctorate (Ed.D. or Ph.D.) also are offered. Graduates of CESS have gone on to become teachers, school administrators, social workers, non-profit leaders, and more. College of Medicine[edit] Main article: Robert Larner College of Medicine In 1804, John Pomeroy began teaching students in his house in Burlington, as the first medical department at a State College or University. In 1822, the College of Medicine was established as the seventh medical college in the United States, founded by Pomeroy and the medical educator Nathan Smith. UVM enrolls approximately 100 medical students in each class; there are approximately 400 medical students total. The University of Vermont Medical Center is the primary clinical site of clinical education. The College of Medicine currently ranks tied for 29th for overall quality in primary care training among the country's 89 programs ranked by U.S. News & World Report for 2016 and 43rd out of 120 in 2019.[35][36] Charles A. Dana Medical Library[edit] The largest medical library in Vermont, the Charles A. Dana Library is the Vermont Resource Library of the National Network of Libraries of Medicine[37] and serves the information needs of the Academic Health Center at the University of Vermont. The Academic Health Center is composed of the faculty, staff and students at UVM's College of Medicine and the College of Nursing and Health Sciences, as well as the physicians and other health care providers at the University of Vermont Medical Center. The library also meets the health sciences information needs of the university's undergraduate and graduate programs and is open to the residents of the state of Vermont with health sciences information questions. College of Nursing and Health Sciences[edit] The College of Nursing and Health Sciences at UVM comprises four departments: Biomedical and Health Sciences, Communication Sciences and Disorders, Nursing, and Rehabilitation and Movement Science, as well as the Institute of Integrative Health, a shared program with the University of Vermont College of Medicine offering a Certificate in Integrative Healthcare. Students in the college major in Athletic Training, Communication Sciences and Disorders (Speech-Language Pathology & Audiology), Exercise and Movement Science, medical laboratory science, nuclear medicine technology, nursing, or radiation therapy. Some of these undergraduate degrees prepare students to enter a graduate degree programs for Speech-Language Pathology or Audiology or a doctorate of physical therapy program. The college also utilizes clinical facilities at the UVM Medical Center (formerly known as Fletcher Allen Health Center). Honors College[edit] The Honors College sponsors opportunities for students to participate in co-curricular programs and extracurricular activities — special symposia, dinners with visiting scholars, and trips to museums and theaters in Montreal and Boston. Faculty are selected from throughout the university to participate in the Honors College as lecturers in a first-year ethics course and advanced seminars, as participants in reading groups, as speakers at the Plenary Lecture Series, and as mentors to honors students conducting research. Through a required ethics course, small seminars, informal gatherings, and special research projects, students work alongside scholars from a section of the university's academic disciplines in the humanities, the sciences, engineering, nursing, medicine, education, business and more. Rubenstein School of Environment and Natural Resources[edit] The George D. Aiken Center houses the Rubenstein School of Environment & Natural Resources From its origins in the School of Natural Resources (originally established in 1973), the Rubenstein School of Environment and Natural Resources (RSENR) was created in 2003. The Rubenstein School of Environment and Natural Resources seeks to cultivate an appreciation and understanding of ecological and social processes and values aimed at maintaining the integrity of natural systems and achieving a sustainable human community in harmony with the natural environment. The Rubenstein School targets three general areas of emphasis for scholarly pursuit: 1. Applied Ecology; 2. Environment & Society; and 3. Development & Use of Innovative Tools (e.g. GIS, spatial analysis, and modeling). The main building hosting RSENR is located at the George D. Aiken Center, which was renovated in 2012 and received a U.S. Green Building Council LEED Platinum certification.[38] In 2007, the university won a $6.7 million grant to research the pollution problems of Lake Champlain.[39] Athletics[edit] Main article: Vermont Catamounts See also: Vermont Catamounts men's ice hockey, Vermont Catamounts men's basketball, and Vermont Catamounts women's ice hockey The athletic teams at UVM are known as the Catamounts. The university offers 18 varsity sports. Women's teams include basketball, cross country, field hockey, ice hockey, lacrosse, skiing, soccer, swimming and diving, and track and field (indoor and outdoor). Men's teams include basketball, cross country, ice hockey, lacrosse, skiing, soccer, and track and field (indoor and outdoor). All teams compete at the NCAA Division I level. Most teams compete in the America East Conference. Men's and women's hockey teams compete in the Hockey East Association. The alpine and Nordic ski teams compete in the E.I.S.A. (Eastern Intercollegiate Ski Association). UVM's athletic teams won seven straight America East Academic Cups (2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011) for the best overall combined GPA among its student-athletes. UVM is the first school in the America East Conference to win three straight years and four times overall. The Gutterson Fieldhouse, built in 1963, houses UVM's hockey rink. Highlights of recent varsity athletic seasons include the men's hockey teams trip to the Frozen Four in 2009; the women's and men's basketball teams advancing to the 2010 NCAA Tournament following America East Tournament titles; the ski team winning its sixth NCAA National Championship in 2012 in Bozeman, MT; in 2014, the men's hockey team earned its third trip to the NCAA Tournament since 2009 and the men's basketball team won the America East Regular Season title for the sixth time. The university has discontinued several major sports programs in its history, including football, softball and baseball. The softball and baseball programs were eliminated in 2009.[40] Thirty-six former UVM athletes have competed in 16 Olympic Games (13 winter, 3 summer) and combined have won six Olympic medals.[41] The UVM fight song was written in 1938 and is entitled ""Vermont Victorious.""[42] Club sports[edit] UVM sponsors many club sports teams. The UVM Sailing Team was competitively ranked 8th in the nation as of November 15, 2009.[43][44] UVM Crew competes in the Head of the Charles Regatta and Dad Vail Regatta, winning Bronze for the Men's Coxed Four in the 2015 ACRA national club rowing championship. The Cycling Team competes against other collegiate varsity teams and has won multiple national titles. Arts[edit] UVM's Lane Performing Arts Series and Music Department sponsor instrumental and choral performances featuring national and international performers throughout the year. The Royall Tyler Theatre presents theater productions on its mainstage, often featuring Equity actors along with student talent. In addition to the Department of Theatre's three mainstage shows each year, a group of student-directed one acts, and The Toys Take Over Christmas, a holiday tradition in Burlington, are also performed. Past mainstage shows have included have been Godspell (2009); Compleat Female Stage Beauty (2008); The Miss Firecracker Contest, Found a Peanut, and La Ronde (2007); Ring Round the Moon, The Underpants, and Macbeth (2006); A Midsummer Night's Dream, Beyond Therapy, and Hair (2005); The Art of Dining, Anouilh's Antigone, and Rumors (2004); and Remember the Children: Terezin and Metamorphoses (2003). The Robert Hull Fleming Museum is the university's museum. Its permanent collection includes a variety of works of art as well as anthropological and ethnographic artifacts. The Museum also features various visiting exhibits and special events. Davis Center, the student resource center of the university completed in the fall of 2007 The Vermont Mozart Festival developed at UVM, and its first festivals also were held at UVM. The festival was incorporated as an independent nonprofit organization in 1976 but retains ties to UVM. Student life[edit] Student clubs and organizations, totaling more than 100, span student interests and receive sponsorship from the Student Government Association. Clubs with longstanding history and the largest memberships include: Volunteers in Action, the UVM Outing Club, Ski & Snowboard Club. Hillel also has a strong presence on the UVM campus; it is estimated that around 2,000 UVM students are Jewish, making up about 20 percent of the undergraduate student body.[45][46][47] UVM also is home to the oldest FeelGood chapter in the nation, started in 2006, with the chapter raising over $100,000 since its inception for the end of extreme poverty by 2030 through on-campus grilled cheese delis.[48] In 2015, the university launched a wellness program called the Wellness Environment, or WE, a substance-free residential program that gives interested students access to fitness and nutrition coaches, has daily yoga instruction, round-the-clock meditation sessions, and a mentorship program that pairs them with a Burlington youth.[49] In fall of 2017, the Central Campus Residence Hall completed construction, and now houses nearly 700 residents in the Wellness Environment. Thanks to an organization known as GIRT, or Gender Inclusive Restroom Taskforce, the University of Vermont has a growing number of single occupancy, gender neutral bathrooms for use by non-binary and gender non-conforming students, faculty, and visitors. One such example is in the Central Campus Residence Hall, which includes gender neutral, single occupancy bathrooms only on the residential floors.[50] Dining[edit] The University of Vermont is home to four unlimited dining halls, as well as various other dining options.[51] The unlimited dining halls consist of Simpson Fine Dining on Redstone Campus, Northside Unlimited Dining on Trinity Campus, the Central Campus Dining Hall (CCRH), and Harris Millis Dining on the Athletic Campus.[52][failed verification] Sustainability[edit] The University of Vermont has a long history toward operational environmental sustainability on its campus. In 1995, the Environmental Council at UVM was established to fill a gap regarding a bridge between operations and academics on campus greening issues.[53] The first Council project was to hear presentations from the various environmental programs on campus to provide a baseline scan of campus operation environmental impact. Greening UVM was published in 1998 by the council to establish a baseline on the environmental impact of the campus' operations. During the same year, a Recycled Paper Policy was created and was implemented in 1999.[54] As a community stakeholder in the Lab-XL project, the Environmental Council received an EPA grant to support the Tracking UVM project and publication to assess relative environmental impact and community interest in laboratory chemical waste. Tracking UVM,[55] a follow-up to the Greening UVM report, was published in 2002 and reported on the environmental progress of the university from 1990 to 2000. The University of Vermont's commitment to tracking its environmental performance was recognized in 2004 with Vermont's Governor's Award for Environmental Excellence for this 2002 environmental report card. Tracking UVM is one of the first report cards that track the environmental impact of campus operations in an institution of higher education. In 2005, UVM's President Daniel M. Fogel signed the institution's Green Building Policy.[56][57] The Recycled Paper Policy was updated in 2006 after two students pushed for the university to commit to purchasing 100 percent post-consumer, chlorine-free paper for routine copying and printing.[58] In 2007, President Fogel signs on to the American College and University Presidents' Climate Commitment.[59] The American College & University Presidents' Climate Commitment (ACUPCC) is a high-visibility effort to address global climate disruption undertaken by a network of colleges and universities that have made institutional commitments to eliminate net greenhouse gas emissions from specified campus operations, and to promote the research and educational efforts of higher education to equip society to re-stabilize the earth's climate. Its mission is to accelerate progress towards climate neutrality and sustainability by empowering the higher education sector to educate students, create solutions, and provide leadership-by-example for the rest of society.[60] In 2008, UVM dissolved the Environmental Council and established the Office of Sustainability.[61] The Office of Sustainability aims to foster sustainable development and promote environmental responsibility at the University of Vermont by strategically bridging the academic activities of teaching, research, and outreach with the operations of the university.[62] The sustainability office reports jointly to the Provost and to the Vice President for Finance & Administration, who supervises the director. There are two full-time staff and four Graduate Fellows, plus an Academic Advisor and a team of supporters. In 2011, UVM released its Climate Action Plan[63] to the American College & University President's Climate Commitment. The climate action plan focuses on the direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions from the institution's operations. The target dates for UVM's climate action plan are 2015 for 100% carbon neutral electricity (Scope 1)[64] and 2020 for carbon neutral heating, cooling, and fleet (Scope 2).[64] UVM aims to target the net zero emissions for its ""Scope 3""[64] sources by 2025. In 2012, UVM became one of the first institutions nationwide to end the sale of bottled water on campus and mandate that one-third of drinks offered in vending machines be healthy options.[65] During the same year, UVM's Board of Trustees passed a resolution to earmark $13 million for the fund, making it the largest challenge to date. Harvard's $12 million green loan fund[66] had been the largest. In March 2012, UVM became 5th school in the nation to sign the ""Real Food Campus Commitment"",[67] pledging to purchase 20 percent real food by 2020. In April 2017, UVM announced it had surpassed this goal and set a new goal to source 25 percent Real Food by 2020.[68] The Certification for Sustainable Transportation (CST) was founded in 2012 to help improve economic, environmental, and energy efficiency within the passenger transportation sector. The CST is a direct outgrowth of work that began at the University of Vermont (UVM) in 2005 and now houses the eRating certification, driver trainings, and an array of awareness and education programs. It is a nonprofit operating out of UVM's Extensions office.[69] The Lawrence Debate Union[edit] The university's debate team,[70] which competes in both the American policy debate and British parliamentary debate formats, is one of the oldest organizations on campus, and receives funding from a private grant established in 1899. The Lawrence Debate Union has sent students abroad to promote cultural understanding. In 2007, students traveled to Slovenia, Malaysia, and Thailand. The school has also sent students to the World Universities Debating Championship held in Ireland, Turkey, Botswana, Manila, Berlin, and Chennai, breaking into elimination rounds in the 2011 World University Debating Championship. Debaters from the LDU have also regularly competed in tournaments hosted by Oxford University and Cambridge University, and in 2013 won the title of the Budapest IV and Vienna IV in consecutive tournaments. Domestically, the LDU has also won the title for Northeast Universities Debating Sweepstakes champion for four consecutive years. The program is currently ranked seventh in the top schools for British Parliamentary debate in the world, and is the third ranked American university on the list, behind only Yale and Cornell.[citation needed] It encourages participation of all interested UVM students, and sponsors public debates at UVM and for the Burlington community.[71] The coach of the LDU, Dr. Alfred C. Snider, was, before his death in late 2015, one of the most decorated debate coaches in the world and also coached the National Speech and Debate Organization's national high school debate team to compete in the world championships.[72] Concerts[edit] Ira Allen Chapel UVM Program Board (UPB) is responsible for bringing live musical entertainment to the UVM community. UPB features acts from across the country as well as local bands. UPB is composed of four committees, one of which is a concerts committee. The concerts committee learns about various aspects of the music industry by putting on shows and working with local sound and production professionals. Students are in charge of choosing and booking bands and are responsible for all production aspects on the day of show. UPB was founded in 2007 by Katie Scheck as it adopted the Concert Bureau was (established in 1971) as one of its committees. Concerts Bureau and UVM Program Board have brought in artists such as R.E.M., Phish (three of its four members attended UVM in the 1980s), Red Hot Chili Peppers, Sting, Lou Reed, Primus, The String Cheese Incident, James Brown, Bob Dylan, the Allman Brothers Band, Death Cab for Cutie, Jurassic 5, the Disco Biscuits, The Grateful Dead, Guster, and The Flaming Lips. Since 2001, the UVM Concert Bureau (which later transitioned into UVM Program Board), have organized an annual festival held in April known as SpringFest. SpringFest headliners have included Vida Blue, The Roots, Cake, Keller Williams, Gov't Mule, co-headliners Robert Randolph & the Family Band, Ziggy Marley, and Talib Kweli. Other acts to perform at various SpringFests have included The Meditations, Toots & the Maytals, Soulive, Rjd2, Apollo Sunshine, Ratatat in 2009, MSTRKRFT in 2010, The Roots and Thievery Corporation in 2011, Dillon Francis in 2012, MGMT in 2013, Atmosphere in 2014, The Disco Biscuits in 2015, The Head and the Heart in 2016, Two Door Cinema Club in 2017, and Playboi Carti in 2018. Publications[edit] The Vermont Cynic, a weekly student newspaper The Water Tower, an alternative weekly student newspaper UVM Today, news from UVM's University Communications Office Vermont Quarterly, UVM's alumni magazine Proverbium: Yearbook of International Proverb Scholarship Greek life[edit] The University of Vermont Greek Community is one of the oldest in the nation with the first fraternal organization starting in 1836. The 5 pillar values of the University of Vermont Greek Community are citizenship, leadership, lifelong learning, friendship, and social justice. The University of Vermont values its Greek Community for their strong commitment to collaboration and relationship building. More than 8 percent of students at UVM join Greek Life organizations. Fraternity and sorority members are very involved on campus in roles including Student Government (SGA), Orientation Leaders, AdvoCats, and Residence Assistants.

It is staffed and operated by University of Vermont students 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.[74] The primary responsibility of UVM Rescue is to provide emergency medical response to the University of Vermont campus, UVM Medical Center Helipad, and the University Health Center (UHC). UVM Rescue is also the secondary ambulance for Burlington, South Burlington, Shelburne, Winooski, Richmond and other local communities as part of its mutual aid plan.[75] UVM Rescue works in conjunction with three local helicopters: North Country Life Flight, Life Net of New York, and the Dartmouth Hitchcock Air Response Team (DHART). UVM Rescue aids UVM Medical Center by transporting the patients and flight crews from the UVMMC Helipad. In 2017, UVM Rescue responded to over 1,800 calls.[75] Requests range in severity from ill students to life-threatening emergencies that include poisonings, multi-trauma, respiratory difficulties, and cardiac arrests. UVM Rescue is also a National Collegiate Emergency Medical Services Foundation member.[76] Notable alumni[edit] Main article: List of University of Vermont people John DeweyPhilosopher, psychologist, and educational reformer(BA) Jody WilliamsNobel Peace Prize Laureate(BA) Madeleine KuninFirst female Governor of Vermont and first female Jewish Governor of a U.S. State, U.S. Ambassador to Switzerland(MA) Phil ScottCurrent Governor of Vermont(BS) Frederick H.

Shutterstock The Princeton Review, a college-admissions company, found the schools where marijuana use is most common.In a survey of 140,000 students, most colleges that made the list were located in states where cannabis is legal, like Vermont, California, and Colorado.The No. 1 school for weed smokers is the University of Vermont, in Burlington.Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. For many, toking up has been as integral a part of the college experience as ultimate Frisbee and late-night study sessions. And while the activity has often been shrouded in secrecy, the mainstreaming of marijuana now has college students openly discussing their smoking habits.Enter the Princeton Review's 2020 edition of ""The Best 385 Colleges,"" which includes among its 62 rankings a list on campus cannabis use cheekily labeled ""Reefer Madness.""To find out which colleges are out-smoking the rest, the Princeton Review surveyed 140,000 students in 385 schools, asking them, ""How widely is marijuana used at your school?"" Not surprisingly, many of the colleges with students reporting highest marijuana use are in states where recreational use of the drug is legal.According to a 2017 Monitoring the Future study from the University of Michigan, 38% of college students aged 19 to 22 have reported smoking weed in the past year. And as a sign of the times, weed isn't just being smoked on campus anymore — it's being taught. Some schools, like Cornell University in New York and Colorado's University of Denver, are offering cannabis courses. The University of Maryland School of Pharmacy will even offer a master's degree in medical cannabis, according to the Wall Street Journal.Here are the colleges where students report the most recreational use of weed. 20.

UW personnel and students: Attest to your COVID-19 vaccination status. Last updated: August 31, 2021 Welcome, Huskies! We’re eager to see you on campus this autumn as we return to in-person instruction and activities. We’ll continue updating this page with the latest information as we plan for autumn quarter. Academics Facilities and learning spaces Housing and dining Student Life and activities COVID-19 vaccination, testing and prevention NEW: Autumn quarter health and safety updates Academics We look forward to safely returning for in-person instruction and activities this autumn. As a public research university, we’re fortunate to have experts in medicine and public health who’ve been studying the pandemic from its beginning. We understand much more about the virus now than when it emerged, and Washington state’s vaccination levels are trending in a very positive direction. Since the UW is on a quarter system, we have even more time to prepare classrooms and campus facilities for the start of autumn quarter on Sept. 29. Our experts know how to ready the UW’s living, learning and working spaces so you can come to campus for in-person classes and activities. As vaccination rates and vaccine availability climb in our region, we will continue making decisions that reflect the most current public health guidance. As you prepare for autumn quarter 2021, there are several steps you should take to ensure your return is safe and successful. Our Back-to-School checklist will give you the scoop on how to get ready for coming back to campus. Remote Advising & Orientation Whether you’re a freshman or a transfer student, advising and orientation sessions will help you build community, register for courses and connect to campus resources before your arrival. If you need a computer or WiFi hotspot, we have those available to ship to your home so that you are prepared to engage. You’ll be able to connect with your Orientation Leader throughout the summer before you meet them in-person during Dawg Daze in the autumn. Families of new students can participate in Family Orientation, which includes self-guided videos and online discussion groups that will allow you to learn and ask questions about the Husky experience. Learn more about advising and orientation for undergraduates. Incoming graduate and professional students can check the Graduate School for updates and for University 501 (U501) a self-guided, online orientation to help you prepare for graduate school. Early Fall Start Because planning for the Early Fall Start program began at an earlier stage in the pandemic, it will be offered remotely. Jump-start your college career from wherever you live before coming to campus for the start of autumn quarter. On-campus housing is available for Early Fall Start students. Learn more in the Early Fall Start Housing Guide. Second Year Students We look forward to welcoming second-year students back to campus with special programming to support your transition this autumn. Campus tours In-person campus tours are back and excited to welcome you! Classrooms and learning spaces As more students and community members become fully vaccinated, we’re confident that Washington state will revise higher education guidelines related to distancing, such as the ones adopted in K-12 schools based on Centers for Disease Control guidance. We’ll continue following state and local public health guidelines on masks and other health and safety measures. Study sessions, RSOs and other co-curricular activities will have safe ways to meet in-person this autumn. All UW Libraries will reopen on or just before the start of fall quarter in September.  Libraries will be open in a limited capacity to start and hours will expand as more student employees are hired during fall quarter. Individual Study Space at the Seattle Research Commons will be open through summer quarter, closing temporarily on August 21 to prepare spaces for fall.  Each Library will have different hours, so be sure to check the Libraries Covid Update page or Libraries hours prior to visiting. Opening dates: Health Sciences Library: Monday, September 13 UW Bothell and Tacoma Libraries: September 20th Odegaard Undergraduate Library: Monday, September 20 — a current, valid Husky card will be required for entry this fall Suzzallo and Allen Libraries: Wednesday, September 22 Special Collections: Wednesday, September 29 — by appointment only Seattle branch Libraries and Tateuchi East Asia Library: Wednesday, September 29 Housing and dining Housing and dining We will return campus housing to full occupancy in the fall, as long as public health guidelines permit. Housing & Food Services (HFS) will provide updates as the overall public health picture becomes clearer in summer, when more people have been vaccinated. Historically, all students who apply during the priority application period (May 4-11 for new freshmen) have been assigned housing, and we expect the same for this academic year. Once you apply, you will receive more updates from HFS. You can also find more information about how we protect your health and safety in our housing and dining facilities on the HFS website. We have well-honed plans in place to follow all preventive health guidelines and support students who may have a COVID diagnosis while living on campus. Students who test positive are asked to temporarily move to a designated place where they can recover safely away from people who may be at risk of being sick. During this time, we’ll help with food and mail delivery, laundry service and engagement activities to keep students stay connected. Our Environmental Health & Safety COVID-19 response team will work with you to understand whether other people may have been exposed, so we can get them tested and protect their health as well. You can learn more about how the University responds to positive cases on our COVID-19 FAQ page. Student Life and activities Recreation, Husky Union Building and other student spaces The IMA is open for Seattle campus students, and opened several recreation spaces this spring including the climbing center, IMA pool, golf range and Waterfront Activities Center. Our recreation facilities follow state COVID-19 guidelines to protect your health and safety, and our goal is to return as near as possible to regular operations in the autumn. The UW is also planning for ways to make all of our fitness classes, intramurals and other activities available in hybrid models so you can stay active no matter how the pandemic evolves. The HUB is currently open with limited operations as an informal learning space for individual UW students, faculty and staff. There are more than 200 seats available for UW community members to comfortably access WiFi for classes, studying and work. Reservations are not required for UW students, faculty and staff to visit the HUB. Learn more about visiting the HUB. Our hope is that our hundreds of clubs and student organizations will be able to offer some level of in-person activities, depending of course on state and local public health guidance. Husky Athletics UW Athletics is planning for Husky football to have a full stadium in the 2021 season, and is also making plans for the return of fans to fall and winter sports. Visit GoHuskies.com/TheReturn for the latest updates on football tickets, including information this May about Dawg Pack student season tickets. COVID-19 vaccines, testing and prevention International students: We recommend bookmarking International Student Services coronavirus information for F1 and J1 students for information on visas, travel and COVID-19 protocols. ISS will update this page as new information becomes available. Continue to monitor your local embassy or consulate’s website, airline guidance and CDC travel notices. Vaccines In order to protect the health and safety of our community, the University of Washington is requiring all students and personnel to be vaccinated against COVID-19, with certain exemptions allowed. You will need to attest to being fully vaccinated or declare an exemption: As soon as possible after the second dose of a 2-dose series or after a 1-dose vaccine, after they have decided to declare an exemption, or by the start of autumn quarter on September 29, 2021, whichever date is earliest. Students who are unable to get vaccinated until after arriving on campus may submit their form by November 5, 2021. If you haven’t been able to get a vaccine where you live, we will have vaccinations available when you arrive. A hold will be placed on winter quarter registrations if your form has not been submitted by November 5, 2021. Please note that students required to participate in the Health Sciences Immunization Program are eligible for medical waivers only. Testing Did you know that the UW has a campus-run testing program that’s free for students, staff and faculty? Husky Coronavirus Testing has been running since autumn quarter 2020 and will continue to provide free, fast testing for current UW students, faculty and staff throughout the summer and during the 2021-22 academic year. You’ll be able to get tested as part of our return-to-campus testing. You can also use Husky Coronavirus Testing if you think you’ve been exposed to COVID-19, or if you have COVID-like symptoms. And we have experience with what we call “surge” or “rapid-response” testing to stop or mitigate potential outbreaks. Since Husky Coronavirus Testing started, the UW’s COVID-19 levels have been lower than in the broader region. We’ve conducted nearly 80,000 tests, with less than 1% coming back positive for COVID-19. Prevention The UW requires all individuals wear masks indoors, regardless of vaccination status. A mask or other suitable face covering is required indoors when other people are present and in all public and common areas, such as lobbies, hallways, stairways, restrooms, elevators and shared vehicles. Vaccinations and face coverings protect each other, making it possible for us to be in community together. You can read all the details about our UW Face Covering Policy from Environmental Health & Safety. Outdoors, face coverings are optional, regardless of vaccination status. However, a face covering is recommended when in outdoor crowded settings and in settings where there is a decreased ability to consistently maintain a physical distance between others. You’re welcome to continue wearing face coverings wherever and whenever you wish for any reason. The UW is fortunate to have outstanding Facilities teams who keep our classrooms and buildings safe all day, every day. If you’d like a deep dive into our cleaning and safety protocols, UW Environmental Health & Safety has a wealth of information on its COVID-19 resources page including its building readiness guidelines.

Media Contact: Kaiser Permanente Washington: Linnae Riesen - Linnae.M.Riesen@kp.org, 206.316.0224 UW Medicine: Bobbi Nodell - bnodell@uw.edu, 206.543.7129 Getty ImagesThe study will grow to include 41 researchers from 10 institutions, 22 from nine departments at the University of Washington.Research to halt the harms caused by Alzheimer’s disease has yielded promising insights and strategies to help people remain cognitively healthy. Now, a new infusion of money to a landmark study tracking older adults will allow researchers to bring about more effective treatments and ways to prevent the disease. The National Institute of Aging, part of the National Institutes of Health, is awarding a grant expected to total $55.6 million to the Adult Changes in Thought study (ACT), led by the University of Washington, Kaiser Permanente Washington and the University of California San Diego. The funds will be used to advance the understanding of Alzheimer’s and diversify and broaden participation in the study. The study personnel will grow to 41 investigators at 10 research institutions across the United States and Canada, including 22 investigators from nine departments in five schools at the University of Washington: Built Environments, Pharmacy, Nursing, E-Science Institute, and Medicine. Alzheimer's, the most common form of dementia, is a progressive and highly variable disease in which symptoms gradually worsen over a number of years.  According to the Alzheimer’s Association, it affects an estimated 6 million Americans. On average, a new person is diagnosed with Alzheimer’s every 65 seconds. Today, there is a worldwide effort to find better ways to treat patients experiencing the disease, delay its onset, and prevent it from developing altogether. Co-principal investigators are Dr. Paul Crane, professor of medicine at the UW School of Medicine, Dr. Eric Larson, senior investigator at Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute, who founded the ACT study in Seattle in 1994, and Andrea LaCroix, professor of and chief of epidemiology at University of California San Diego. “This grant launches us into the next realm of investigation,” said Crane. He started working on the ACT study nearly 20 years ago as a fellow at the UW Department of Medicine, and worked with Larson as ACT's co-principal investigator for the past several years. Since it began, the ACT study has enrolled more than 5,800 older adults who receive care as Kaiser Permanente Washington members. Researchers track participants to find out which ones remain healthy as they age, which ones develop dementia, and how the condition manifests itself. The new five-year grant will increase the current study group of 2,000 members to 3,000. The enrollment effort will include new strategies to recruit a more diverse population. “We have become a dynamic ‘living laboratory’ of aging,” said Larson. “Thanks to the generosity of the ACT volunteers, we can investigate years of detailed medical records for study participants – often dating back decades before the study began because of their membership in Kaiser Permanente Washington – and do state-of-the-art studies of the brains from those who consent to autopsy.” More than 900 study participants arranged for their brains to be donated to the study after they died. These donations have allowed ACT to establish a brain bank tied to a community health care system with comprehensive electronic health records of the donors’ care at Kaiser Permanente Washington and its precursor, Group Health Cooperative. The grant will allow these and other data from ACT to be digitized and shared with researchers worldwide, further cementing the study’s role as an important repository for data on older adults. As part of the new funding, researchers will pursue three research projects: One will examine relationships between device-measured physical activity and sleep over the 24-hour day and brain aging and dementia. Susan McCurry from the UW School of Nursing leads this project together with Dori Rosenberg from Kaiser Permanente Washington. A second project will characterize subtypes of Alzheimer’s dementia to see whether they have different brain imaging or neuropathology findings, and whether people with these different subtypes have different experiences with dementia. Dr. Crane leads this project together with Janelle Taylor from the University of Toronto. A third project will study the effects of commonly used drugs that the ACT Study has shown can influence dementia risk. The study will examine the drugs’ effects on neuron cells grown from participant cells using state-of-the-art stem cell approaches. Dr. Shelly Gray from the UW School of Pharmacy leads this project with Dr. Jessica Young from the UW School of Medicine’s Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine. These and other ACT projects build on a legacy of ACT findings, published in dozens of studies, that have advanced the understanding of dementia. ACT researchers have identified and quantified numerous factors that affect brain aging, including early life exposures, education, hearing and vision loss, traumatic brain injuries, hypertension, alcohol consumption, obesity, smoking, depression and social isolation, physical inactivity, and blood sugar levels and diabetes. A few examples from findings have shown: Frequent exercisers had a 38% lower incidence of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia than those exercising three or fewer times per week. Higher blood glucose levels are associated with an 18% increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia in people without diabetes and a 40% increased risk in people with diabetes. 47% of cognitively normal brains had substantial neuritic plaque density, and 33% had microinfarcts, which runs counter to a widespread view that such markers are reliable indicators of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia. The study has linked a number of medications to a higher risk for developing dementia. “As both an epidemiologist and the daughter of a mom now suffering from Alzheimer’s disease, I have a deep commitment to finding ways to improve brain aging,” said. LaCroix, who was involved at the start of the study. “We are all indebted to the ACT community participants past, current, and future, who will be working with us on these discoveries over the next five years and beyond.” The grant is divided into six cores: 1) Clinical Core is led by Larson from Kaiser Permanente Washington. 2) Life Course Core is led Sarah Tom from Columbia University and La Croix from UC San Diego. 3) Neuropathology Core is led by Dr. Dirk Keene from Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at the UW School of Medicine. 4) Neuroimaging Core is led by Dr. Christine Mac Donald from the Department of Neurosurgery at UW School of Medicine. 5) Data and Analysis Core is led by Jennifer Nelson and Rod Walker from Kaiser Permanente Washington. 6) Administration Core is led by KatieRose Richmire from Kaiser Permanente Washington. The ACT team also includes faculty and staff from Boston University, Columbia University, Swedish Medical Center in Seattle, University of California Riverside, University of Pennsylvania, University of Toronto, and University of Wisconsin-Madison.  ACT is funded by NIH grant number U19AG066567.

There are about 2,200 students at CalTech, and the primary campus in Pasadena, near Los Angeles, covers 124 acres (about 50 hectares). Almost all undergraduates live on campus. Across the six faculties, there is a focus on science and engineering. In addition to Nobel laureates and top researchers, the CalTech graduate community includes a number of politicians and public advisers, particularly in the areas of science, technology and energy.ADVERTISEMENT All first-year students belong to one of four houses as part of the university’s alternative model to fraternities and sororities. A number of house traditions and events are associated with each house.ADVERTISEMENT Caltech: ‘uniquely difficult but a wonderful place to study’ =1. Harvard University Harvard University is probably the best known university in the world, topping the Times Higher Education reputation rankings most years. Founded in 1636, it is the oldest higher education institution in the US. About 21,000 students are enrolled, a quarter of whom are international. Although tuition is expensive, Harvard’s financial endowment allows for plenty of financial aid for students. The Harvard Library system is made up of 79 libraries and counts as the largest academic library in the world.ADVERTISEMENT Among many famous alumni, Harvard can count eight US presidents, 158 Nobel laureates, 14 Turing Award winners and 62 living billionaires.ADVERTISEMENT Unlike some other universities at the top of the list, Harvard is at least equally reputed for arts and humanities as it is for science and technology, if not more so. Vlogging a day at Harvard University 3. Stanford University Based in Palo Alto, right beside Silicon Valley, Stanford University has had a prominent role in encouraging the region’s tech industry to develop. Many faculty members, students and alumni have founded successful technology companies and start-ups, including Google, Snapchat and Hewlett-Packard.ADVERTISEMENT In total, companies founded by Stanford alumni make $2.7 trillion (£2.2 trillion) each year. The university is often referred to as “the Farm” because the campus was built on the site of the Stanford family’s Palo Alto stock farm. The campus covers 8,180 acres (3,300 hectares), but more than half of the land is not yet developed. With its distinctive sand-coloured, red-roofed buildings, Stanford’s campus is thought to be one of the most beautiful in the world. It contains a number of sculpture gardens and art museums, as well as a public meditation centre.ADVERTISEMENT As might be expected from one of the best universities in the world, Stanford is highly competitive. The admission rate stands at just over 5 per cent. Of the 16,000 students – most of whom live on campus – 22 per cent are international.ADVERTISEMENT Video: how I got into Stanford University as a low-income international student 4. Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) MIT cultivates a strong entrepreneurial culture, which has seen many alumni found notable companies such as Intel and Dropbox. Unusually, the undergraduate and postgraduate programmes at MIT are not wholly separate; many courses can be taken at either level. The undergraduate programme is one of the country’s most selective, admitting only 8 per cent of applicants. Engineering and computer science programmes are the most popular among undergraduates. Thirty-three per cent of the 11,000 students are international, hailing from 154 countries.ADVERTISEMENT Famous alumni include astronaut Buzz Aldrin, former UN secretary general Kofi Annan and physicist Richard Feynman. Women in STEM: stories from MIT students 5. Princeton University Princeton is one of the oldest universities in the US and is part of the prestigious group of Ivy League universities. As well as high-quality teaching and research output, the university is well-known for its beautiful campus, with some buildings designed by some of America’s most well-known architects. Notable alumni who have won a Nobel prize include the physicists Richard Feynman and Robert Hofstadter and chemists Richard Smalley and Edwin McMillan.ADVERTISEMENT Princeton has also educated two US presidents, James Madison and Woodrow Wilson. Other distinguished graduates include Michelle Obama, actors Jimmy Stewart and Brooke Shields, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Apollo astronaut Pete Conrad.

Media Contact: Leila Gray, 206.475.9809, leilag@uw.edu Lindau Nobel Laureate MeetingEdmond Fischer converses with aspiring scientists at the 2014 Lindau Nobel Laureate MeetingNobel Prize Laureate Dr. Edmond H. Fischer, a longtime faculty member in biochemistry at the University of Washington School of Medicine, died peacefully in Seattle Aug. 27, 2021. He was 101. Fischer shared the 1992 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with UW medical school faculty colleague Edwin G. Krebs, who died in 2006 at 91. They were honored for describing how reversible phosphorylation of proteins acts as a switch to regulate a variety of biochemical processes in cells. Fischer was born in 1920 in the Shanghai International Settlement in China. His mother, Renee Tapernoux, was from France and grew up in Switzerland and his father, attorney Oscar Fischer, was from Austria. His maternal grandfather established a French newspaper and school in Shanghai. At age 7, Fischer and his two older brothers were sent to boarding school in Switzerland. In high school he and a friend declared their interest in making a major contribution to medical science. When his parents asked him what he wanted for his sixteenth birthday, he knew. As a young boy, he had discovered the life and work of Louis Pasteur, an early pioneer in microbiology and vaccination, and became enthralled. He wanted a microscope. “I expected to receive a kid microscope,” he later revealed. Instead, on the advice of his parents, his brother, who was then a college student in Switzerland, purchased for him a professional-grade light microscope with three oil-immersion lenses and a moving stage. “It was a treasure,” he recalled when he was 99. Armed with this microscope and a desire to help people like his father, who had tuberculosis, Fischer would go on to study microbiology at the University of Geneva. While an undergraduate there, he and a friend converted a rented attic of a nearby house into their own research laboratory at a cost of sixteen Swiss francs, or four dollars, per month. This unusual commitment to research was noticed by faculty who soon offered both young men formal positions — one as a medical trainee, the other as a scientist. Edwin Krebs (left) and Edmond Fischer in October 1992 after learning they would receive a Nobel Prize. Davis Freeman photo Over time, his interest shifted away from microbes and toward the chemistry of life. In 1947, Fischer published his doctoral thesis on the isolation of amylase, a key starch-degrading enzyme from the human pancreas. While seeking a place to conduct postdoctoral research in the early 1950s, Fischer was offered a position at the UW School of Medicine. He was drawn to Seattle in part because its surrounding mountains and lakes reminded him of Switzerland. Fischer would remain at the UW for the rest of his career. Months into his first position at the UW, Fischer began working alongside the biochemist Edwin Krebs. Both men had conducted research on similar proteins — one from muscle tissue, the other from potatoes. In the case of the muscle protein, an additional chemical was needed for the enzyme to function. In the case of the potato protein, however, no extra chemical was needed. The two men found this discrepancy odd. They came to discover that many proteins, including glycogen phosphorylase from muscle, are controlled by a chemical transformation known as reversible phosphorylation. The discovery was initially published in the early 1950s. Its significance to biology and medicine unfolded over the years. The insight into this biochemical regulatory switch continues to illuminate fundamental biology and advance medical research in cancer, diabetes and many other fields to this day. “This was really serendipity,” Fischer told the Nobel Prize foundation in 2000. “You know where you start in research, and you never know where you will end up.” In describing Krebs' and Fischer's discovery, Dr. William Catterall, former chair of pharmacology at UW Medicine, said in 2001: ""The widespread importance of this work cannot be overemphasized. There is no more important discovery in cell biology in our time."" Throughout his decades as a UW professor Fischer mentored scores of graduate students and postdoctoral scholars. He was also recognized with numerous awards, honorary degrees, and memberships to renowned research academies from around the world. He was elected a fellow in the National Academy of Arts and Sciences, a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a Foreign Member of the Royal Society. He was the honorary president of the World Cultural Council from 2007 until 2014. He enjoyed the Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings to foster scientific exchanges with scientists from different generations, cultures and fields. This summer he attended the meeting virtually, and also participated in the online orchestra. Please see the Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings' tribute to Fischer's life. Fischer was a talented pianist who had considered a career as a classical musician before choosing science. He also enjoyed flying and for a while held a private pilot’s license. “I will remember Eddy both as a scientist and as a warm, wonderful colleague,” said Trisha Davis, professor and chair of the UW Department of Biochemistry. “Although he formally retired in 1990, the Fischer lab remained active for several more years, and Eddy never lost touch with the department. Right up until the pandemic, he attended research seminars and dropped in on faculty lunches where he never told the same story twice. He was a great man. We will miss him very much.” Fischer was married in 1948 to Nelly Gagnaux, and in 1963 to Beverly Bullock, both now deceased. Fischer is survived by his eldest son François (Frank), his youngest son Henri and his stepdaughter from his second marriage, Paula Dandliker. The Fischer grandchildren are Élyse, Léandre (Leo), Ian and Edmond (Eddie). Services will be private.  A celebration of Fischer's life will be planned for this autumn.

Named for George Washington—the first U.S. president—the state was made out of the western part of the Washington Territory, which was ceded by the British Empire in 1846, in accordance with the Oregon Treaty in the settlement of the Oregon boundary dispute. The state—which is bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean, Oregon to the south, Idaho to the east, and the Canadian province of British Columbia to the north—was admitted to the Union as the 42nd state in 1889. Olympia is the state capital; the state's largest city is Seattle. Washington is often referred to as Washington state to distinguish it from the nation's capital, Washington, D.C.[4][5] Washington is the 18th-largest state, with an area of 71,362 square miles (184,830 km2), and the 13th-most populous state, with more than 7.7 million people.[6] The majority of Washington's residents live in the Seattle metropolitan area, the center of transportation, business, and industry on Puget Sound,[7][8] an inlet of the Pacific Ocean consisting of numerous islands, deep fjords, and bays carved out by glaciers. The remainder of the state consists of deep temperate rainforests in the west; mountain ranges in the west, central, northeast, and far southeast; and a semi-arid basin region in the east, central, and south, given over to intensive agriculture. Washington is the second most populous state on the West Coast and in the Western United States, after California. Mount Rainier, an active stratovolcano, is the state's highest elevation at 14,411 feet (4,392 meters), and is the most topographically prominent mountain in the contiguous U.S. Washington is a leading lumber producer; its rugged surface is rich in stands of Douglas fir, hemlock, ponderosa pine, white pine, spruce, larch, and cedar. The state is the largest producer of apples, hops, pears, blueberries, spearmint oil, and sweet cherries in the U.S., and ranks high in the production of apricots, asparagus, dry edible peas, grapes, lentils, peppermint oil, and potatoes.[9][10] Livestock, livestock products, and commercial fishing—particularly of salmon, halibut, and bottomfish—are also significant contributors to the state's economy.[11] Washington ranks second only to California in wine production. Manufacturing industries in Washington include aircraft, missiles, shipbuilding, and other transportation equipment, food processing, metals and metal products, chemicals, and machinery.[12] Washington has more than a thousand dams, including the Grand Coulee Dam, built for a variety of purposes including irrigation, electricity generation, flood control, and water storage. Washington is one of the wealthiest and most socially liberal states in the country.[13] The state consistently ranks among the best for life expectancy and low unemployment.[14] Along with Colorado, Washington was one of the first to legalize medicinal and recreational cannabis,[15] was among the first thirty-six states to legalize same-sex marriage in 2012,[16] and was one of only four U.S. states to have been providing legal abortions on request before the 1973 Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade loosened abortion laws nationwide.[17] Similarly, Washington voters approved a 2008 referendum on legalization of physician-assisted suicide,[18] and is currently one of ten states—along with Washington, D.C.—to have legalized the practice.[19] Contents 1 Etymology 2 History 2.1 Early history 2.2 European exploration 2.3 European settlement 2.4 Statehood 2.5 Post–statehood 3 Geography 3.1 Western Washington 3.2 Eastern Washington 3.3 Climate 3.3.1 Rain shadow effects 3.3.2 Temperatures 3.4 Flora and fauna 3.5 Administrative divisions 4 Demographics 4.1 Population 4.2 Areas of concentration 4.3 Languages 4.4 Religion 5 Economy 5.1 Taxes 5.2 Agriculture 5.3 Wine 5.4 Internet access 6 Transportation 7 Environment 8 Government and politics 8.1 State government 8.2 Federal representation 8.3 Politics 8.4 Notable legislation 9 Education 9.1 Elementary and secondary education 9.2 Higher education 10 Health care 10.1 Insurance 10.2 Facilities 11 Culture 11.1 Sports 11.1.1 Major professional teams 11.1.2 Minor professional and amateur teams 11.1.3 College sports teams 11.1.4 Individual sports 12 Symbols, honors, and names 12.1 The Evergreen State 12.2 State symbols 13 See also 14 Notes 15 References 16 Further reading 17 External links Etymology[edit] Washington was named after President George Washington by an act of the United States Congress during the creation of Washington Territory in 1853; the territory was to be named ""Columbia"", for the Columbia River and the Columbia District, but Kentucky representative Richard H. Stanton found the name too similar to the District of Columbia (the national capital, itself containing the city of Washington), and proposed naming the new territory after President Washington.[20][21][22] Washington is the only U.S. state named after a president.[23] Confusion over the state of Washington and the city of Washington, D.C., led to renaming proposals during the statehood process for Washington in 1889, including David Dudley Field II's suggestion to name the new state ""Tacoma""; these proposals failed to garner support.[24] Washington, D.C.'s, own statehood movement in the 21st century has included a proposal to use the name ""State of Washington, Douglass Commonwealth"", which would conflict with the current state of Washington.[4] Residents of Washington (known as ""Washingtonians"") and the Pacific Northwest simply refer to the state as ""Washington"", and the nation's capital ""Washington, D.C."", ""the other Washington"",[25] or simply ""D.C."" History[edit] Main article: History of Washington (state) Early history[edit] A farm and barren hills near Riverside, in north central Washington The 9,300-year-old skeletal remains of Kennewick Man, one of the oldest and most complete human remains found in North America, were discovered in Washington in the 1990s.[26] The area has been known to host megathrust earthquakes in the past, the last being the Cascadia earthquake of 1700.[27] Before the arrival of Europeans, the region had many established tribes of indigenous peoples, notable for their totem poles and their ornately carved canoes and masks. Prominent among their industries were salmon fishing and, notably among the Makah, whale hunting.[28][29] The peoples of the Interior had a different subsistence-based culture based on hunting, food-gathering and some forms of agriculture, as well as a dependency on salmon from the Columbia and its tributaries. The smallpox epidemic of the 1770s devastated the Native American population.[30] European exploration[edit] Main articles: Oregon Country and Columbia District The first recorded European landing on the Washington coast was by Spanish Captain Don Bruno de Heceta in 1775,[31] on board the Santiago, part of a two-ship flotilla with the Sonora. He claimed the coastal lands up to Prince William Sound for Spain as part of their claimed rights under the Treaty of Tordesillas, which they maintained made the Pacific a ""Spanish lake"" and all its shores part of the Spanish Empire. In 1778, British explorer Captain James Cook sighted Cape Flattery, at the entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fuca, but Cook did not realize the strait existed.[32] It was not discovered until Charles William Barkley, captain of the Imperial Eagle, sighted it in 1787.[33] The straits were further explored by Spanish explorers Manuel Quimper in 1790 and Francisco de Eliza in 1791,[34][35] and British explorer George Vancouver in 1792.[36] European settlement[edit] Main article: Oregon pioneer history The British–Spanish Nootka Convention of 1790 ended Spanish claims of exclusivity and opened the Northwest Coast to explorers and traders from other nations, most notably Britain and Russia as well as the fledgling United States.[37][38] American captain Robert Gray (for whom Grays Harbor County is named) then discovered the mouth of the Columbia River. He named the river after his ship, the Columbia.[39] Beginning in 1792, Gray established trade in sea otter pelts. The Lewis and Clark Expedition entered the state on October 10, 1805.[40] Explorer David Thompson, on his voyage down the Columbia River, camped at the confluence with the Snake River on July 9, 1811,[41] and erected a pole and a notice claiming the territory for Great Britain and stating the intention of the North West Company to build a trading post at the site. Fur trading at Fort Nez Percés in 1841 Britain and the United States agreed to what has since been described as ""joint occupancy"" of lands west of the Continental Divide to the Pacific Ocean as part of the Anglo–American Convention of 1818, which established the 49th Parallel as the international boundary west from Lake of the Woods to the Rocky Mountains.[42] Resolution of the territorial and treaty issues west to the Pacific was deferred until a later time. In 1819, Spain ceded their rights north of the 42nd Parallel to the United States.[43] Negotiations with Great Britain over the next few decades failed to settle upon a compromise boundary and the Oregon boundary dispute was highly contested between Britain and the United States. Disputed joint-occupancy by Britain and the U.S. lasted for several decades. With American settlers pouring into Oregon Country, Hudson's Bay Company, which had previously discouraged settlement because it conflicted with the fur trade, reversed its position in an attempt to maintain British control of the Columbia District.[44] Fur trapper James Sinclair, on orders from Sir George Simpson, Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company, led some 200 settlers from the Red River Colony west in 1841 to settle on Hudson Bay Company farms near Fort Vancouver.[45] The party crossed the Rockies into the Columbia Valley, near present-day Radium Hot Springs, British Columbia, then traveled south-west down the Kootenai River and Columbia River. Despite such efforts, Britain eventually ceded all claims to land south of the 49th parallel to the United States in the Oregon Treaty on June 15, 1846.[46] In 1836, a group of missionaries, including Marcus Whitman, established several missions and Whitman's own settlement Waiilatpu, in what is now southeastern Washington state, near present day Walla Walla County, in territory of both the Cayuse and the Nez Perce Indian tribes.[47] Whitman's settlement would in 1843 help the Oregon Trail, the overland emigration route to the west, get established for thousands of emigrants in the following decades. Marcus provided medical care for the Native Americans, but when Indian patients—lacking immunity to new, ""European"" diseases—died in striking numbers, while at the same time many white patients recovered, they held ""medicine man"" Marcus Whitman personally responsible, and murdered Whitman and twelve other white settlers in the Whitman massacre in 1847.[48] This event triggered the Cayuse War between settlers and Indians. Fort Nisqually, a farm and trading post of the Hudson's Bay Company and the first European settlement in the Puget Sound area, was founded in 1833.[49] Black pioneer George Washington Bush and his Caucasian wife, Isabella James Bush, from Missouri and Tennessee, respectively, led four white families into the territory and founded New Market, now Tumwater, in 1846.[50] They settled in Washington to avoid Oregon's Black Exclusion Law, which prohibited African Americans from entering the territory while simultaneously prohibiting slavery.[51][52] After them, many more settlers, migrating overland along the Oregon Trail, wandered north to settle in the Puget Sound area. Statehood[edit] Main articles: Oregon boundary dispute, Provisional Government of Oregon, Oregon Treaty, Oregon Territory, Organic act § List of organic acts, Washington Territory, Admission to the Union, List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union, and Mount Baker Gold Rush Seattle in 1887 The growing population of Oregon Territory north of the Columbia River formally requested a new territory. As a result of the Monticello Convention, held in present-day Cowlitz County, U.S. Congress passed legislation and President Millard Fillmore signed into law on March 2, 1853, the creation of a new Washington Territory.[53][22] The boundary of Washington Territory initially extended farther east than the present state, including what is now the Idaho Panhandle and parts of western Montana, and picked up more land to the southeast that was left behind when Oregon was admitted as a state; the creation of Idaho Territory in 1863 established the final eastern border. A Washington state constitution was drafted and ratified in 1878, but it was never officially adopted.[54] Although never approved by the United States Congress, the 1878 constitution is an important historical document which shows the political thinking of the time; it was used extensively during the drafting of Washington state's 1889 constitution, the one and only official Constitution of the State of Washington. Washington became the 42nd state of the United States on November 11, 1889.[55] Early prominent industries in the new state included agriculture and lumber. In eastern Washington, the Yakima River Valley became known for its apple orchards,[56] while the growth of wheat using dry farming techniques became particularly productive. Heavy rainfall to the west of the Cascade Range produced dense forests, and the ports along Puget Sound prospered from the manufacturing and shipping of lumber products, particularly the Douglas fir. Other industries that developed in the state included fishing, salmon canning and mining.[11][57] Post–statehood[edit] Boeing B-17E Flying Fortress bombers under construction, circa 1942 Main article: 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens For a long period, Tacoma had large smelters where gold, silver, copper, and lead ores were treated.[58] Seattle was the primary port for trade with Alaska and the rest of the country, and for a time, it possessed a large shipbuilding industry. The region around eastern Puget Sound developed heavy industry during the period including World War I and World War II, and the Boeing company became an established icon in the area.[59] During the Great Depression, a series of hydroelectric dams were constructed along the Columbia River as part of a project to increase the production of electricity. This culminated in 1941 with the completion of the Grand Coulee Dam, the largest concrete structure in the United States and largest dam in the world at its construction.[60] During World War II, the state became a focus for war industries. While the Boeing company produced many heavy bombers, ports in Seattle, Bremerton, Vancouver, and Tacoma were available for the manufacture of warships. Seattle was the point of departure for many soldiers in the Pacific, a number of whom were quartered at Discovery Park.[61] In eastern Washington, the Hanford Works atomic energy plant was opened in 1943, and played a major role in the construction of atomic bombs.[62] After the end of World War II, and with the beginning of the civil rights movement, the state's growing Black or African American population's wages were 53% above the national average. The early diversification of Washington through the Great Migration led to successful efforts at reducing discrimination in the workplace.[63][64] In 1950, Seattle's first black representative for the state's legislature was elected. At the 1970 U.S. census, the black population grew to 7.13% of the total population.[65] In 1970, the state was one of only four U.S. states to have been providing legal abortions before the 1973 Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade which loosened abortion laws nationwide.[17][66] On May 18, 1980, following a period of heavy tremors and small eruptions, the north face of Mount St. Helens slid off in the largest landslide in recorded history before erupting violently, destroying a large part of the top of the volcano. The eruption flattened the forest up to 20 km north of the volcano, killed 57 people, flooded the Columbia River and its tributaries with ash and mud, and blanketed large parts of Washington eastward and other surrounding states in ash, making day look like night.[67][68] Geography[edit] See also: Geology of the Pacific Northwest Major cities in Washington BellinghamEverettKennewickTacomaSeattleSpokaneVancouverYakimaOlympiaWashington (state) (Washington (state)) The Pacific Coast of Westport, WA Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest Washington is the northwesternmost state of the contiguous United States. It borders Idaho to the east, bounded mostly by the meridian running north from the confluence of the Snake River and Clearwater River (about 117°02'23"" west), except for the southernmost section where the border follows the Snake River. Oregon is to the south, with the Columbia River forming the western part and the 46th parallel forming the eastern part of the Oregon–Washington border. During Washington's partition from Oregon, the original plan for the border followed the Columbia River east until the confluence with the Snake, and then would have followed the Snake River east; this was changed in order to keep Walla Walla's fertile farmland in Washington. To the west of Washington lies the Pacific Ocean.[69] Its northern border lies mostly along the 49th parallel, and then via marine boundaries through the Strait of Georgia, Haro Strait, and Strait of Juan de Fuca, with the Canadian province of British Columbia to the north.[70] Washington is part of a region known as the Pacific Northwest, a term which always refers to at least Washington and Oregon, and may or may not include some or all the following, depending on the user's intent: Idaho, western Montana, northern California, British Columbia, and Alaska. The high mountains of the Cascade Range run north–south, bisecting the state. In addition to western Washington and eastern Washington, residents call the two parts of the state the ""West side"" and the ""East side"", ""Wet side"" and ""Dry side"", or ""Timberland"" and ""Wheatland"", the latter pair more commonly in the names of region-specific businesses and institutions. These terms reflect the geography, climate and industry of the land on both sides of the Cascades. Western Washington[edit] Major volcanoes in Washington Mount BakerGlacier PeakMount RainierMount St. HelensMount AdamsWashington (state) (Washington (state)) From the Cascade Mountains westward, western Washington has a mostly mediterranean climate, with mild temperatures and wet winters, autumns and springs, and relatively dry summers. The Cascade Range has several volcanoes, which reach altitudes significantly higher than the rest of the mountains. From north to south, these major volcanoes are Mount Baker, Glacier Peak, Mount Rainier, Mount St. Helens, and Mount Adams. All are active volcanoes.[71] Mount Rainier—the tallest mountain in the state—[72] is 50 miles (80 km) south of the city of Seattle, from which it is prominently visible. The U.S. Geological Survey considers 14,411-foot-tall (4,392 m) Mount Rainier the most dangerous volcano in the Cascade Range, due to its proximity to the Seattle metropolitan area, and most dangerous in the continental U.S. according to the Decade Volcanoes list.[73] It is also covered with more glacial ice than any other peak in the contiguous 48 states.[74] Western Washington also is home of the Olympic Mountains, far west on the Olympic Peninsula, which support dense forests of conifers and areas of temperate rainforest. These deep forests, such as the Hoh Rainforest, are among the only rainforests in the continental United States.[75] While western Washington does not always suffer from a high amount of rainfall as measured in total inches of rain per year, it does consistently have more rainy days per year than most other places in the country.[76] Eastern Washington[edit] Southeastern Washington Eastern Washington—the part of the state east of the Cascades—has a relatively dry climate, in distinct contrast to the west side. It includes large areas of semiarid steppe and a few truly arid deserts in the rain shadow of the Cascades; the Hanford reservation receives an average annual precipitation of 6 to 7 inches (150 to 180 mm). Despite the limited amount of rainfall, agriculture is an extremely important business throughout much of eastern Washington, as the soil is highly productive and irrigation, aided by dams along the Columbia River, is fairly widespread.[77] The spread of population in eastern Washington is dominated by access to water, especially rivers. The main cities are all located alongside rivers or lakes; most of them are named after the river or lake they adjoin. Farther east, the climate becomes less arid, with annual rainfall increasing as one goes east to 21.2 inches (540 mm) in Pullman, near the Washington–Idaho border.[78] The Okanogan Highlands and the rugged Kettle River Range and Selkirk Mountains cover much of the state's northeastern quadrant. The Palouse southeast region of Washington was grassland that has been mostly converted into farmland, and extends to the Blue Mountains.[79] Climate[edit] See also: Climate change in Washington Köppen climate types of Washington state Dryland farming caused a large dust storm in arid parts of eastern Washington on October 4, 2009. Courtesy: NASA/GSFC, MODIS Rapid Response.[80] Major factors determining Washington's climate include the large semi-permanent high pressure and low pressure systems of the north Pacific Ocean, the continental air masses of North America, and the Olympic and Cascade mountains. In the spring and summer, a high pressure anticyclone system dominates the north Pacific Ocean, causing air to spiral out in a clockwise fashion. For Washington, this means prevailing winds from the northwest bring relatively cool air and a predictably dry season.[81] In the autumn and winter, a low-pressure cyclone system takes over in the north Pacific Ocean. The air spiraling inward in a counter-clockwise fashion causes Washington's prevailing winds to come from the southwest, and bring relatively warm and moist air masses and a predictably wet season. The term ""Pineapple Express"" is used colloquially to describe atmospheric river events, where repeated storm systems are directed by this persistent cyclone from tropical and near-tropical Pacific regions into the Pacific Northwest.[82] Despite western Washington's marine climate similar to many coastal cities of Europe, there are exceptions such as the ""Big Snow"" events of 1880, 1881, 1893, and 1916,[83][84] and the ""deep freeze"" winters of 1883–1884, 1915–1916, 1949–1950, and 1955–1956, among others.[85] During these events, western Washington experienced up to 6 feet (1.8 m) of snow, sub-zero (−18 °C) temperatures, three months with snow on the ground, and lakes and rivers frozen over for weeks.[84] Seattle's lowest officially recorded temperature is 0 °F (−18 °C) set on January 31, 1950, but low-altitude areas approximately three hours away from Seattle have recorded lows as cold as −48 °F (−44 °C).[86] The Southern Oscillation greatly influences weather during the cold season. During the El Niño phase, the jet stream enters the U.S. farther south through California, therefore late fall and winter are drier than normal with less snowpack. The La Niña phase reinforces the jet stream through the Pacific Northwest, causing Washington to have more rain and snow than average.[87] In 2006, the Climate Impacts Group at the University of Washington published The Impacts of Climate change in Washington's Economy, a preliminary assessment on the risks and opportunities presented given the possibility of a rise in global temperatures and their effects on Washington state.[88] Rain shadow effects[edit] Main article: Rain shadow Washington experiences extensive variation in rainfall. Rainfall in Washington varies dramatically going from east to west. The Olympic Peninsula's western side receives as much as 160 inches (4,100 mm) of precipitation annually, making it the wettest area of the 48 conterminous states and a temperate rainforest. Weeks may pass without a clear day. The western slopes of the Cascade Range receive some of the heaviest annual snowfall (in some places more than 200 inches or 5,100 millimeters water equivalent) in the country. In the rain shadow area east of the Cascades, the annual precipitation is only 6 inches (150 mm). Precipitation then increases again eastward toward the Rocky Mountains (about 120 miles (190 km) east of the Idaho border). The Olympic mountains and Cascades compound this climatic pattern by causing orographic lift of the air masses blown inland from the Pacific Ocean, resulting in the windward side of the mountains receiving high levels of precipitation and the leeward side receiving low levels. This occurs most dramatically around the Olympic Mountains and the Cascade Range. In both cases the windward slopes facing southwest receive high precipitation and mild, cool temperatures. While the Puget Sound lowlands are known for clouds and rain in the winter, the western slopes of the Cascades receive larger amounts of precipitation, often falling as snow at higher elevations.[89] Mount Baker, near the state's northern border, is one of the snowiest places in the world. In 1999, it set the world record for snowfall in a single season—1,140 inches (95 ft; 29 m).[90] East of the Cascades, a large region experiences strong rain shadow effects. Semi-arid conditions occur in much of eastern Washington with the strongest rain shadow effects at the relatively low elevations of the central Columbia Plateau—especially the region just east of the Columbia River from about the Snake River to the Okanagan Highland. Thus, instead of rain forests, much of eastern Washington is covered with dry grassland, shrub-steppe, and sand dunes. Temperatures[edit] The average annual temperature ranges from 51 °F (11 °C) on the Pacific coast to 40 °F (4 °C) in the northeast. The lowest temperature recorded in the state was −48 °F (−44 °C) in Winthrop and Mazama.[91] The highest recorded temperature in the state was 118 °F (48 °C) at Ice Harbor Dam on August 5, 1961.[92] Both records were set east of the Cascades. Western Washington is known for its mild climate, considerable fog, frequent cloud cover, long-lasting drizzles in the winter and warm, temperate summers. The eastern region, which does not benefit from the general moderating effect of the Pacific Ocean, occasionally experiences extreme climate. Arctic cold fronts in the winter and heat waves in the summer are not uncommon. In the Western region, temperatures have only reached as high as 107 °F (42 °C) in Centralia,[93] and as low as −6 °F (−21 °C) in Longview.[94] Climate data for Washington state (1895–2015) Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °F (°C) 74(23) 83(28) 95(35) 103(39) 107(42) 118(48) 118(48) 118(48) 111(44) 99(37) 83(28) 74(23) 118(48) Mean maximum °F (°C) 60(16) 64(18) 73(23) 86(30) 94(34) 102(39) 109(43) 106(41) 98(37) 84(29) 67(19) 60(16) 112(44) Average high °F (°C) 34.8(1.6) 40.6(4.8) 47.7(8.7) 55.9(13.3) 63.6(17.6) 69.9(21.1) 78.0(25.6) 77.3(25.2) 69.4(20.8) 57.2(14.0) 43.2(6.2) 36.2(2.3) 56.2(13.4) Average low °F (°C) 23.0(−5.0) 26.0(−3.3) 29.6(−1.3) 34.2(1.2) 40.1(4.5) 45.7(7.6) 50.5(10.3) 50.0(10.0) 44.7(7.1) 37.2(2.9) 29.9(−1.2) 25.3(−3.7) 36.4(2.4) Mean minimum °F (°C) −19(−28) −8(−22) −2(−19) 14(−10) 21(−6) 26(−3) 31(−1) 31(−1) 24(−4) 16(−9) 2(−17) −8(−22) −20(−29) Record low °F (°C) −42(−41) −40(−40) −25(−32) −7(−22) 11(−12) 20(−7) 22(−6) 20(−7) 11(−12) −5(−21) −29(−34) −48(−44) −48(−44) Average precipitation inches (mm) 6.08(154) 4.61(117) 4.23(107) 2.87(73) 2.31(59) 1.89(48) 0.85(22) 1.02(26) 1.93(49) 3.67(93) 6.22(158) 6.52(166) 42.2(1,072) Source 1: ""Office of the Washington State Climatologist"".

Approximately two-thirds of Washington's forested area is publicly owned, including 64 percent of federal land.[105] Common trees and plants in the region are camassia, Douglas fir, hemlock, penstemon, ponderosa pine, western red cedar, and many species of ferns.[106] The state's various areas of wilderness offer sanctuary, with substantially large populations of shorebirds and marine mammals. The Pacific shore surrounding the San Juan Islands are heavily inhabited with killer, gray, and humpback whales.[107] In eastern Washington, the flora is vastly different. Tumbleweeds and sagebrush dominate the landscape throughout large parts of the countryside. Russian olives and other trees are common alongside riverbanks; however, apart from the riversides, enormous swaths of eastern Washington have no naturally existing trees at all (though many trees have been planted and are irrigated by people, of course). A wider variety of flora can be found in both the Blue Mountains and the eastern sides of the Cascades. Mammals native to the state include the bat, black bear, bobcat, cougar, coyote, deer, elk, gray wolf, hare, moose, mountain beaver, muskrat, opossum, pocket gopher, rabbit, raccoon, river otter, skunk, and tree squirrel.[108] Because of the wide range of geography, the State of Washington is home to several different ecoregions, which allow for a varied range of bird species. This range includes raptors, shorebirds, woodland birds, grassland birds, ducks, and others.[109] There have also been a large number of species introduced to Washington, dating back to the early 18th century, including horses and burros.[110] The channel catfish, lamprey, and sturgeon are among the 400 known freshwater fishes.[111][112] Along with the Cascades frog, there are several forms of snakes that define the most prominent reptiles and amphibians.[113][114] Coastal bays and islands are often inhabited by plentiful amounts of shellfish and whales. There are five species of salmon that ascend the Western Washington area, from streams to spawn.[107] Washington has a variety of National Park Service units. Among these are the Alta Lake State Park, Lake Roosevelt National Recreation Area, San Juan Islands National Wildlife Refuge, as well as three national parks—the Olympic National Park, North Cascades National Park, and Mount Rainier National Park.[115] The three national parks were established between 1899 and 1968. Almost 95 percent (876,517 acres, 354,714 hectares, 3,547.14 square kilometers) of Olympic National Park's area has been designated as wilderness under the National Wilderness Preservation System.[116] Additionally, there are 143 state parks and 9 national forests, run by the Washington State Park System and the United States Forest Service.[117] The Okanogan National Forest is the largest national forest on the West Coast, encompassing 1,499,023 acres (606,633 ha). It is managed together as the Okanogan–Wenatchee National Forest, encompassing a considerably larger area of around 3,239,404 acres (1,310,940 ha).[118] Administrative divisions[edit] Main articles: List of counties in Washington and List of municipalities in Washington There are 39 counties within the state, and 281 incorporated municipalities which are divided into cities and towns.[119] The majority of the state's population lives within western Washington, in the Seattle metropolitan area; the city of Seattle is the principal city of the metropolitan area, and western Washington, with a 2020 census population of 737,015.[120] In eastern Washington, the population is primarily concentrated within Spokane and its metropolitan area. vte Largest cities or towns in WashingtonSource:[121] Rank Name County Pop.

The Washington State Office of Financial Management reported the state population at 7,656,200 as of April 1, 2020.[128] As of the 2010 Census, the population of Washington was 6,724,540. The Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue Metropolitan Area population was 3,439,809 in the 2010 Census, half the state total.[129] The center of population of Washington in 2010 was at 47°20′N 121°37′W﻿ / ﻿47.33°N 121.62°W﻿ / 47.33; -121.62, in an unpopulated part of the Cascade Mountains in rural eastern King County, southeast of North Bend, northeast of Enumclaw, and west of Snoqualmie Pass.[130] Washington's proportion of residents under age five was 6.7%, and 25.7% under 18, and 11.2% 65 or older. The racial composition of Washington's population as of 2016 was: Race and Hispanic origin of Washington by county, showing race by color, and then breaking down non-Hispanic and Hispanic origin by color tone. County population shown by size and by label. The same data on the map below shows non-Hispanic and Hispanic origin first, and then breaks that down by race using color tone.[131] The same race and origin data as above, but Hispanic origin is grouped first, then by race. The first emphasizes the racial diversity of people of Hispanic origin, while the second grouping gives a clearer indication of total Hispanic population.[131] Washington race and Hispanic origin (2017)[131] Race Hispanic origin Population Total White non-Hispanic 5,055,463 5,848,957 Hispanic 793,494 Asian non-Hispanic 598,551 613,140 Hispanic 14,589 Black non-Hispanic 269,580 295,453 Hispanic 25,873 Native American non-Hispanic 92,427 132,794 Hispanic 40,367 Pacific Islander non-Hispanic 49,895 55,034 Hispanic 5,139 2+ races non-Hispanic 309,545 364,922 Hispanic 55,377 Total 7,310,300 Washington Historical Racial Composition Racial composition 1990[132] 2000[133] 2010[134] 2018[135] White 88.5% 81.8% 77.3% 79.5% Black or African American 3.1% 3.2% 3.6% 4.2% American Indian and Alaska Native 1.7% 1.6% 1.5% 1.9% Asian 4.3% 5.5% 7.2% 8.9% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander – 0.4% 0.6% 0.8% Other race 2.4% 3.9% 5.2% N/A Two or more races – 3.6% 4.7% 4.7% According to the 2016 American Community Survey, 12.1% of Washington's population were of Hispanic or Latino origin (of any race): Mexican (9.7%), Puerto Rican (0.4%), Cuban (0.1%), and other Hispanic or Latino origin (1.8%).[136] The five largest ancestry groups were: German (17.8%), Irish (10.8%), English (10.4%), Norwegian (5.4%), and American (4.6%).[137] Birth data In 2011, 44.3 percent of Washington's population younger than age 1 were minorities.[138] Note: Births in table don't add up, because Hispanics are counted both by their ethnicity and by their race, giving a higher overall number.

Areas of concentration[edit] Washington population density map While the population of African Americans in the Pacific Northwest is relatively scarce overall, they are mostly concentrated in the South End and Central District areas of Seattle, and in inner Tacoma.[146] The black community of Seattle consisted of one individual in 1858, Manuel Lopes, and grew to a population of 406 by 1900.[147] It developed substantially during and after World War II when wartime industries and the U.S. Armed Forces employed and recruited tens of thousands of African Americans from the Southeastern United States. They moved west in the second wave of the Great Migration left a high influence in West Coast rock music and R&B and soul in the 1960s, including Seattle native Jimi Hendrix, a pioneer in hard rock, who was of African American and Cherokee Indian descent. Native Americans lived on Indian reservations or jurisdictory lands such as the Colville Indian Reservation, Makah, Muckleshoot Indian Reservation, Quinault, Salish people, Spokane Indian Reservation, and Yakama Indian Reservation. The westernmost and Pacific coasts have primarily American Indian communities, such as the Chinook, Lummi, and Salish. Urban Indian communities formed by the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs relocation programs in Seattle since the end of World War II brought a variety of Native American peoples to this diverse metropolis. The city was named for Chief Seattle in the very early 1850s when European Americans settled the sound. Chinese New Year, Seattle (2011) Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are mostly concentrated in the Seattle−Tacoma metropolitan area of the state. Seattle, Bellevue, and Redmond, which are all within King County, have sizable Chinese communities (including Taiwanese), as well as significant Indian and Japanese communities. The Chinatown-International District in Seattle has a historical Chinese population dating back to the 1860s, who mainly emigrated from Guangdong Province in southern China, and is home to a diverse East and Southeast Asian community. Koreans are heavily concentrated in the suburban cities of Federal Way and Auburn to the south, and in Lynnwood to the north. Tacoma is home to thousands of Cambodians, and has one of the largest Cambodian-American communities in the United States, along with Long Beach, California, and Lowell, Massachusetts.[148] The Vietnamese and Filipino populations of Washington are mostly concentrated within the Seattle metropolitan area.[149] Washington state has the second highest percentage of Pacific Islander people in the mainland U.S. (behind Utah); the Seattle-Tacoma area is home to more than 15,000 people of Samoan ancestry, who mainly reside in southeast Seattle, Tacoma, Federal Way, and in SeaTac.[150][151] The most numerous (ethnic, not racial, group) are Latinos at 11%, as Mexican Americans formed a large ethnic group in the Chehalis Valley, farming areas of Yakima Valley, and Eastern Washington. They were reported to at least date as far back as the 1800s.[152] But it was in the late 20th century, that large-scale Mexican immigration and other Latinos settled in the southern suburbs of Seattle, with limited concentrations in King, Pierce, and Snohomish Counties during the region's real estate construction booms in the 1980s and 1990s. Additionally, Washington has a large Ethiopian community, with many Eritrean residents as well.[153] Both emerged in the late 1960s, and developed since 1980.[154] An estimated 30,000 Somali immigrants reside in the Seattle area.[155] Languages[edit] Top 10 non-English languages spoken in Washington Language Percentage of population(as of 2010)[156] Spanish 7.79% Chinese[a] 1.19% Vietnamese 0.94% Tagalog 0.84% Korean 0.83% Russian 0.80% German 0.55% Japanese 0.39% French 0.33% Ukrainian 0.27% In 2010, 82.51% (5,060,313) of Washington residents age 5 and older spoke English at home as a primary language, while 7.79% (477,566) spoke Spanish, 1.19% (72,552) Chinese (which includes Cantonese and Mandarin), 0.94% (57,895) Vietnamese, 0.84% (51,301) Tagalog, 0.83% (50,757) Korean, 0.80% (49,282) Russian, and 0.55% (33,744) German. In total, 17.49% (1,073,002) of Washington's population age 5 and older spoke a mother language other than English.[156] Religion[edit] Religion in Washington as of 2014[update][157] Religion Percent Protestant 40% Unaffiliated 32% Catholic 17% Latter Day Saints 4% Jewish 1% Hindu 1% Muslim 0.5% Other faiths 3% Further information: Pacific Northwest § Spirituality and religion Major religious affiliations of the people of Washington are:[158] Christian: 60% Protestant: 40% Evangelical Protestant: 25% Mainline Protestant: 13% Black church: 2% Catholic: 17% Latter-day Saint: 4% Unaffiliated: 32% Jewish: 1% Hindu: 1% Muslim: 0.5% Other religions 3% The largest denominations by number of adherents in 2010 were the Roman Catholic Church, with 784,332; The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, with 282,356;[159] and the Assemblies of God, with 125,005.[160] Aquarian Tabernacle Church is the largest Wiccan church in the country.[161] Like other West Coast states, the percentage of Washington's population identifying themselves as ""non-religious"" is higher than the national average. The percentage of non-religious people in Washington is one of the highest in the United States. Economy[edit] Main article: Economy of Washington (state) See also: List of Washington locations by per capita income and List of Washington (state) companies Microsoft Corporation headquarters in Redmond, an Eastside suburb of Seattle Washington has a relatively strong economy, with a total gross state product of $612,996.5 billion in 2019, placing it 5th in the nation and growing by 6.5 percent per year—the fastest rate in the United States.[162][163] The minimum wage as of January 1, 2021 was $13.69 an hour, the second highest of any state or district in the country behind Washington D.C at $14.00 an hour. Significant business within the state include the design and manufacture of aircraft (Boeing), automotive (Paccar), computer software development (Microsoft, Bungie, Amazon, Nintendo of America, Valve, ArenaNet), telecom (T-Mobile US), electronics, biotechnology, aluminum production, lumber and wood products (Weyerhaeuser), mining, beverages (Starbucks, Jones Soda), real estate (John L. Scott, Colliers International, Windermere Real Estate, Kidder Mathews), retail (Nordstrom, Eddie Bauer, Car Toys, Costco, R.E.I.), and tourism (Alaska Airlines, Expedia, Inc.). A Fortune magazine survey of the top 20 Most Admired Companies in the U.S. has four Washington-based companies: Amazon, Starbucks, Microsoft, and Costco.[164] At over 80 percent the state has significant amounts of hydroelectric power generation. Also, significant amounts of trade with Asia pass through the ports of the Puget Sound, leading to a number six ranking of U.S. ports (ranking combines twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) moved and infrastructure index).[165] With the passage of Initiative 1183, the Washington State Liquor Control Board (WSLCB) ended its monopoly of all-state liquor store and liquor distribution operations on June 1, 2012. Among Washington's resident billionaires are, as of August 2021[update], both the second and the fourth wealthiest people in the world: Jeff Bezos of Amazon, with a net worth of $176.6 billion, and Bill Gates of Microsoft, at of $124.3 billion.[166] As of April 2014[update], other Washington state billionaires included Microsoft's Paul Allen, Steve Ballmer, and Charles Simonyi, and Craig McCaw of McCaw Cellular Communications, James Jannard of Oakley, and Howard Schultz of Starbucks.[167] As of December 2020[update], the state's unemployment rate is 7 percent.[168] Taxes[edit] Starbucks headquarters, Seattle The state of Washington is one of seven states that do not levy a personal income tax. The state does not collect a corporate income tax or franchise tax either. Washington businesses are responsible for various other state levies, including the business and occupation tax (B & O), a gross receipts tax which charges varying rates for different types of businesses. Washington's state base sales tax is 6.5%, which is combined with a local sales tax that varies by locality. The combined state and local retail sales tax rates increase the taxes paid by consumers, depending on the variable local sales tax rates, generally between 7.5% and 10%.[169] As of March 2017, the combined sales tax rate in Seattle and Tacoma was 10.1%.[170] The cities of Lynnwood and Mill Creek have the highest sale tax rate in the state at 10.5%.[171] These taxes apply to services as well as products.[172] Most foods are exempt from sales tax. However, prepared foods, dietary supplements, and soft drinks remain taxable. An excise tax applies to certain products such as gasoline, cigarettes, and alcoholic beverages. Property tax was the first tax levied in the state of Washington, and its collection accounts for about 30% of Washington's total state and local revenue. It continues to be the most important revenue source for public schools, fire protection, libraries, parks and recreation, and other special purpose districts. All real property and personal property are subject to tax, unless specifically exempted by law. Most personal property owned by individuals is exempt from tax. Personal property tax applies to personal property used when conducting business, or to other personal property not exempt by law. All property taxes are paid to the county treasurer's office where the property is located. Washington does not impose a tax on intangible assets such as bank accounts, stocks, or bonds. Neither does the state assess any tax on retirement income earned and received from another state. Washington does not collect inheritance taxes. However, the estate tax is de-coupled from the federal estate tax laws, and therefore, the state imposes its own estate tax. Washington state has the 18th highest per capita effective tax rate in the United States, as of 2017.[citation needed] Their tax policy differs from neighboring Oregon's, which levies no sales tax, but does levy a personal income tax. This leads to border economic anomalies in the Portland-Vancouver metropolitan area.[173] Additional border economies exist with neighboring British Columbia and Idaho.[citation needed] Agriculture[edit] Azwell, WA, a small community of pickers' cabins and apple orchards Washington is a leading agricultural state. The following figures are from the Washington State Department of Agriculture and the USDA, National Agricultural Statistics Service, Washington Field Office. For 2018, the total value of Washington's agricultural products was $10.6 billion.[174] In 2014, Washington ranked first in the nation in production of red raspberries (90.5 percent of total U.S. production), hops (79.3 percent), spearmint oil (75 percent), wrinkled seed peas (70.4 percent), apples (71.1 percent), sweet cherries (62.3 percent), pears (45.6 percent), Concord grapes (55.1 percent), carrots for processing (30.6 percent), and green peas for processing (32.4 percent).[175] Washington also ranked second in the nation in production of fall potatoes (a quarter of the nation's production), nectarines, apricots, asparagus, all raspberries, grapes (all varieties taken together), sweet corn for processing (a quarter of the nation's production), and summer onions (a fifth of the nation's production). Washington also ranked third in the nation in production of dried peas, lentil, onions, and peppermint oil.[174] The apple industry is of particular importance to Washington. Because of the favorable climate of dry, warm summers and cold winters of central Washington, the state has led the U.S. in apple production since the 1920s.[176] Two areas account for the vast majority of the state's apple crop: the Wenatchee–Okanogan region (comprising Chelan, Okanogan, Douglas, and Grant counties), and the Yakima region (comprising Yakima, Benton, and Kittitas counties).[177] Washington produces seven principal varieties of apples which are exported to more than sixty countries.[178] Wine[edit] Main article: Washington wine Washington ranks second in the United States in the production of wine, behind only California.[179] By 2006, the state had over 31,000 acres (130 km2) of vineyards, a harvest of 120,000 short tons (109,000 t) of grapes, and exports going to more than forty countries around the world from the state's 600 wineries. While there are some viticultural activities in the cooler, wetter western half of the state, almost all (99%) of wine grape production takes place in the desert-like eastern half.[180] The rain shadow of the Cascade Range leaves the Columbia River Basin with around 8 inches (200 mm) of annual rain fall, making irrigation and water rights of paramount interest to the Washington wine industry. Viticulture in the state is also influenced by long sunlight hours (on average, two more hours a day than in California during the growing season) and consistent temperatures.[181] Internet access[edit] This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (December 2017) As of December 2014, there are 124 broadband providers offering service to Washington state; 93 percent of consumers have access to broadband speeds of 25/3Mbit/s or more. From 2009–2014, the Washington State Broadband Project was awarded $7.3 million in federal grants, but the program was discontinued in 2014.[182] For infrastructure, another $166 million has been awarded since 2011 for broadband infrastructure projects in Washington state.[183] U.S. News & World Report ranked Washington 2nd nationally for household internet access, and 6th for online download speed, based on data from 2014 and 2015.[184] Transportation[edit] This section needs additional citations for verification.

(November 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Washington has the largest ferry system in the United States. Floating bridges on Lake Washington Washington has a system of state highways, called State Routes, as well as an extensive ferry system which is the largest in the nation[185] and the third largest in the world. There are 140 public airfields in Washington, including 16 state airports owned by the Washington State Department of Transportation. Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (Sea-Tac) is the major commercial airport of greater Seattle.[186] Boeing Field in Seattle is one of the busiest primary non-hub airports in the U.S.[187] There are extensive waterways around Washington's largest cities, including Seattle, Bellevue, Tacoma and Olympia. The state highways incorporate an extensive network of bridges and the largest ferry system in the United States to serve transportation needs in the Puget Sound area. Washington's marine highway constitutes a fleet of twenty-eight ferries that navigate Puget Sound and its inland waterways to 20 different ports of call, completing close to 147,000 sailings each year. Washington is home to four of the five longest floating bridges in the world: the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge, Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge and Homer M. Hadley Memorial Bridge over Lake Washington, and the Hood Canal Bridge which connects the Olympic Peninsula and Kitsap Peninsula. Among its most famous bridges is the Tacoma Narrows Bridge, which collapsed in 1940 and was rebuilt. Washington has a number of seaports on the Pacific Ocean, including Seattle, Tacoma, Kalama, Anacortes, Vancouver, Longview, Grays Harbor, Olympia, and Port Angeles. The Cascade Mountain Range also impedes transportation. Washington operates and maintains roads over seven[vague] major mountain passes and eight minor passes. During winter months some of these passes are plowed, sanded, and kept safe with avalanche control. Not all stay open through the winter. The North Cascades Highway, State Route 20, closes every year due to snowfall and avalanches in the area of Washington Pass. The Cayuse and Chinook passes east of Mount Rainier also close in winter.[citation needed] vteWashington passenger rail stations Legend Cascadesto Vancouver, British Columbia Bellingham Mount Vernon Stanwood Leavenworth Everett Mukilteo Wenatchee Edmonds Seattle Ephrata Tukwila Kent Spokane Auburn Empire Builder to Chicago Sumner Puyallup Pasco (Tri-Cities) Tacoma Wishram Tacoma Dome South Tacoma Lakewood Point Defiancebypass Olympia–Lacey Bingen–White Salmon Centralia Kelso–Longview Vancouver, Washington Empire Builder to PortlandCascades to Eugene–Springfield Coast Starlight to Los Angeles Diagram is not to scale Amtrak only Sounder only both Washington is crossed by a number of freight railroads, and Amtrak's passenger Cascade route between Eugene, Oregon and Vancouver, BC is the eighth busiest Amtrak service in the U.S. Seattle's King Street Station, the busiest station in Washington, and 15th busiest in the U.S.,[188] serves as the terminus for the two long distance Amtrak routes in Washington, the Empire Builder to Chicago and the Coast Starlight to Los Angeles. The Sounder commuter rail service operates in Seattle and its surrounding cities, between Everett and Lakewood. The intercity network includes the Cascade Tunnel, the longest railroad tunnel in the United States, which is part of the Stevens Pass route on the BNSF Northern Transcom.[189] Sound Transit Link light rail currently operates in the Seattle area at a length of 20 miles (32 km), and in Tacoma at a length of 1.6 miles (2.6 km). The entire system has a funded expansion plan that will expand light rail to a total of 116 miles by 2041. Seattle also has a 3.8-mile (6.1 km) streetcar network with two lines and plans to expand further by 2025. Bus systems exist across the state, the busiest being King County Metro, located in Seattle and King County, with just above 122 million riders in 2017.[190] Residents of Vancouver have resisted proposals to extend Portland's mass transit system into Washington.[citation needed] Environment[edit] Hanford Nuclear Reservation is currently the most contaminated nuclear site in the United States[191] and is the focus of the nation's largest environmental cleanup.[192] The radioactive materials are known to be leaking from Hanford into the environment.[193] In 2007, Washington became the first state in the nation to target all forms of highly toxic brominated flame retardants known as PBDEs for elimination from the many common household products in which they are used. A 2004 study of 40 mothers from Oregon, Washington, British Columbia, and Montana found PBDEs in the breast milk of every woman tested. Three recent studies by the Washington State Department of Ecology showed toxic chemicals banned decades ago linger in the environment and concentrate in the food chain. In one of the studies, state government scientists found unacceptable levels of toxic substances in 93 samples of freshwater fish from 45 sites. The toxic substances included PCBs, dioxins, two chlorinated pesticides, DDE, dieldrin and PBDEs. As a result of the study, the department will investigate the sources of PCBs in the Wenatchee River, where unhealthy levels of PCBs were found in mountain whitefish. Based on the 2007 information and a previous 2004 Ecology study, the Washington State Department of Health advises the public not to eat mountain whitefish from the Wenatchee River from Leavenworth downstream to where the river joins the Columbia, due to unhealthy levels of PCBs. Study results also showed high levels of contaminants in fish tissue that scientists collected from Lake Washington and the Spokane River, where fish consumption advisories are already in effect.[194] On March 27, 2006, Governor Christine Gregoire signed into law the recently approved House Bill 2322. This bill would limit phosphorus content in dishwashing detergents statewide to 0.5 percent over the next six years. Though the ban would be effective statewide in 2010, it would take place in Whatcom County, Spokane County, and Clark County in 2008.[195] A recent discovery had linked high contents of phosphorus in water to a boom in algae population. An invasive amount of algae in bodies of water would lead to a variety of excess ecological and technological issues.[196] Government and politics[edit] State government[edit] Main article: Government of the State of Washington The Washington State Capitol building in Olympia Washington's executive branch is headed by a governor elected for a four-year term. The current statewide elected officials are: Jay Inslee, Governor (D) Denny Heck, Lieutenant Governor (D) Kim Wyman, Secretary of State (R) Mike Pellicciotti, State Treasurer (D) Patrice McCarthy, State Auditor (D)[197] Bob Ferguson, Attorney General (D) Chris Reykdal, Superintendent of Public Instruction (non-partisan office) Hilary Franz, Commissioner of Public Lands (D) Mike Kreidler, Insurance Commissioner (D) The bicameral Washington State Legislature is the state's legislative branch. The state legislature is composed of a lower House of Representatives and an upper State Senate. The state is divided into 49 legislative districts of equal population, each of which elects two representatives and one senator. Representatives serve two-year terms, while senators serve for four years. There are no term limits. The Democratic Party has a majority in the House and Senate. The Washington Supreme Court is the highest court in the state. Nine justices serve on the bench and are elected statewide. Federal representation[edit] See also: United States congressional delegations from Washington U.S. Senators Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell visit Fairchild Air Force Base outside Spokane The two current United States senators from Washington are Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell, both Democrats. Murray has represented the state since 1993, while Cantwell was first elected in 2001. The state is one of four with two female senators.[198] Washington's ten representatives in the United States House of Representatives (see map of districts) as of the 2020 election are Suzan DelBene (D-1), Rick Larsen (D-2), Jaime Herrera Beutler (R-3), Dan Newhouse (R-4), Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-5), Derek Kilmer (D-6), Pramila Jayapal (D-7), Kim Schrier (D-8), Adam Smith (D-9), and Marilyn Strickland (D-10). Due to Congressional redistricting as a result of the 2010 Census, Washington gained one seat in the United States House of Representatives. With the extra seat, Washington also gained one electoral vote, raising its total to 12.

Washington has voted for the Democratic presidential nominee in every election since 1988. Due to Western Washington's large population, Democrats usually fare better statewide. The Seattle metropolitan combined statistical area, home to almost two-thirds of Washington's population, generally delivers stronger Democratic margins than most other parts of Western Washington. This is especially true of King County, home to Seattle and almost a third of the state's population. Washington was considered a key swing state in 1968, and it was the only western state to give its electoral votes to Democratic nominee Hubert Humphrey over his Republican opponent Richard Nixon. Washington was considered a part of the 1994 Republican Revolution, and had the biggest pick-up in the house for Republicans, who picked up seven of Washington's nine House seats.[200] However, this dominance did not last for long, as Democrats picked up one seat in the 1996 election,[201] and two more in 1998, giving the Democrats a 5–4 majority.[202] The governorship is held by Democrat Jay Inslee, who was elected to his first term in the 2012 gubernatorial election and, after the 2020 election, became the first incumbent in more than 40 years to be elected for a third term. In 2013 and 2014, both houses of the Washington State Legislature (the Washington Senate and the Washington House of Representatives) were controlled by Democrats. The state senate was under Republican control, due to two Democrats' joining Republicans to form the Majority Coalition Caucus. After the 2014 elections, the Democrats retained control of the House, while Republicans took a majority in the Senate without the need for a coalition. In November 2017, a special election gave Democrats a one seat majority in the Senate and complete control over state government. Since then, in the 2018 election, the Democrats have only expanded their majorities. No state has gone longer without a Republican governor than Washington. Democrats have controlled the Washington Governor's Mansion for 36 years; the last Republican Governor was John Spellman, who left office in 1985. Washington has not voted for a Republican senator, governor, or presidential candidate since 1994, tying Delaware for the longest streak in the country.[203] Washington uses the non-partisan blanket primary system after the approval of Initiative 872 in 2004.[204] All candidates run on the same ballot during primary elections and the top two candidates advance to the general election in November, regardless of party affiliation. This has resulted in several same-party general election match-ups. Notable legislation[edit] Washington is one of three states to have legalized assisted suicide. In 2008 the Washington Death with Dignity Act ballot initiative passed and became law. In November 2009, Washington voters approved full domestic partnerships via Referendum 71, marking the first time voters in any state expanded recognition of same-sex relationships at the ballot box. Three years later, in November 2012, same-sex marriage was affirmed via Referendum 74, making Washington one of only three states to have approved same-sex marriage by popular vote. Also in November 2012, Washington was one of the first two states to approve the legal sale and possession of cannabis for both recreational and medical use with Initiative 502. Although marijuana is still illegal under U.S. federal law, persons 21 and older in Washington state can possess up to one ounce of marijuana, 16 ounces of marijuana-infused product in solid form, 72 ounces of marijuana-infused product in liquid form, or any combination of all three, and can legally consume marijuana and marijuana-infused products.[205] In November 2016, voters approved Initiative 1433, which among other things requires employers to guarantee paid sick leave to most workers. On January 1, 2018, the law went into effect, with Washington becoming the seventh state with paid sick leave requirements.[206] With the passage of Initiative 1639 in the 2018 elections, Washington adopted stricter gun laws. Washington enacted a measure in May 2019 in favor of sanctuary cities, similar to California and Oregon laws which are among the strongest statewide mandates in the nation.[207] In 2019 the legislature passed the Clean Energy Transformation Act, which requires all electricity sales to be from zero-carbon sources by 2045 and net-zero by 2030.[208] Education[edit] Elementary and secondary education[edit] As of the 2008–2009 school year, 1,040,750 students were enrolled in elementary and secondary schools in Washington, with 59,562 teachers employed to educate them.[209] As of August 2009, there were 295 school districts in the state, serviced by nine Educational Service Districts.[210] Washington School Information Processing Cooperative (a non-profit opt-in state agency) provides information management systems for fiscal & human resources and student data. Elementary and secondary schools are under the jurisdiction of the Washington State Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI).[211] High school juniors and seniors in Washington have the option of using the state's Running Start program. Begun by the state legislature in 1990, it allows students to attend institutions of higher education at public expense, simultaneously earning high school and college credit.[212] Washington State University Baseball vs. UCLA The state also has several public arts focused high schools including Tacoma School of the Arts, the Vancouver School of Arts and Academics, and The Center School. There are also four Science and Math based high schools: one in the Tri-Cities known as Delta, one in Tacoma known as SAMI, another in Seattle known as Raisbeck Aviation High School, and one in Redmond known as Tesla STEM High School. Higher education[edit] There are more than 40 institutions of higher education in Washington. The state has major research universities, technical schools, religious schools, and private career colleges. Colleges and universities include the University of Washington, Seattle University, Washington State University, Western Washington University, Eastern Washington University, Central Washington University, Seattle Pacific University, Saint Martin's University, Pacific Lutheran University, Gonzaga University, University of Puget Sound, The Evergreen State College, and Whitman College. vteEducation in WashingtonState school administration Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction Department of Early Learning State Board of Education School Information Processing Cooperative Local school administration School districts Educational service districts Rural school districts Higher education Colleges and universities Student Achievement Council Other Office of the Education Ombuds Homeschooling Washington Assessment of Student Learning High schools Private schools Health care[edit] Insurance[edit] The top two health insurers as of 2017 were Premera Blue Cross, with 24 percent market share, followed by Kaiser Permanente at 21 percent.[213] For the individual market, Molina Healthcare had the top share at 23%.[214] The state adopted the Washington Healthplanfinder system in 2014 after the passage of the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (also known as ""ObamaCare""). The state of Washington reformed its health care system in 1993 through the Washington Health Services Act. The legislation required individuals to obtain health insurance or face penalties, and required employers to provide insurance to employees. In addition, health insurance companies were required to sell policies to all individuals, regardless of pre-existing conditions, and cover basic benefits.[215] The act was mostly repealed in 1995 before it could go into full effect. Facilities[edit] See also: List of hospitals in Washington (state) Hospitals exist across the state, but many of Washington's best-known medical facilities are located in and around Seattle. The Seattle–Tacoma area has five major hospitals: Harborview Medical Center, University of Washington Medical Center, Swedish Medical Center, MultiCare Tacoma General Hospital, and St. Joseph Medical Center.[216] The Seattle-area hospitals are concentrated on First Hill, which is home to Virginia Mason Medical Center (the neighborhood has received the nickname ""Pill Hill"" owing to the high concentration of healthcare facilities).[217] Culture[edit] Washington state symbolsFlag of WashingtonLiving insigniaAmphibianPacific chorus frogBirdAmerican goldfinchFishSteelhead troutFlowerRhododendronGrassBluebunch wheatgrassInsectGreen DarnerMammalOlympic marmot/OrcaTreeWestern HemlockInanimate insigniaDanceSquare danceFoodAppleGemstonePetrified woodShipLady WashingtonSoilTokulTartanWashington state tartanOtherVegetable: Sweet onionState route markerState quarterReleased in 2007Lists of United States state symbols Sports[edit] Major professional teams[edit] Club Sport League Stadium and city OL Reign Soccer National Women's Soccer League Cheney Stadium, Tacoma Seattle Kraken Ice Hockey National Hockey League Climate Pledge Arena, Seattle Seattle Mariners Baseball Major League Baseball (AL) T-Mobile Park, Seattle Seattle Seahawks Football National Football League (NFC) Lumen Field, Seattle Seattle Sounders FC Soccer Major League Soccer (West) Lumen Field, Seattle Seattle Storm Basketball Women's National Basketball Association Alaska Airlines Arena, Seattle&Angel of the Winds Arena, Everett Minor professional and amateur teams[edit] Club Sport League Stadium and city Everett AquaSox Baseball High-A West (High-A) Everett Memorial Stadium, Everett Everett Silvertips Ice hockey Western Hockey League Angel of the Winds Arena, Everett Seattle Dragons American football XFL Lumen Field, Seattle Seattle Majestics American football Women's Football Alliance French Field, Kent Seattle Mist Indoor football Legends Football League ShoWare Center, Kent Seattle Saracens Rugby union Canadian Direct Insurance Premier League Magnuson Park, Seattle Seattle Seawolves Rugby union Major League Rugby Starfire Stadium, Tukwila Seattle Thunderbirds Ice hockey Western Hockey League ShoWare Center, Kent Spokane Chiefs Ice hockey Western Hockey League Spokane Arena, Spokane Spokane Indians Baseball High-A West (High-A) Avista Stadium, Spokane Tacoma Defiance Soccer USL Championship Cheney Stadium, Tacoma Tacoma Rainiers Baseball Triple-A West (Triple-A) Cheney Stadium, Tacoma Tacoma Stars Indoor soccer Major Arena Soccer League ShoWare Center, Kent Tri-City Americans Ice hockey Western Hockey League Toyota Center, Kennewick Tri-City Dust Devils Baseball High-A West (High-A) Gesa Stadium, Pasco Wenatchee Wild Ice hockey British Columbia Hockey League Town Toyota Center, Wenatchee College sports teams[edit] NCAA Division I Washington Huskies (Pac-12 Conference; Football Bowl Subdivision) Washington State Cougars (Pac-12 Conference; Football Bowl Subdivision) Gonzaga Bulldogs (West Coast Conference) Seattle Redhawks (Western Athletic Conference) Eastern Washington Eagles (Big Sky Conference; Football Championship Subdivision) NCAA Division II Central Washington Wildcats Saint Martin's Saints Seattle Pacific Falcons Western Washington Vikings NCAA Division III Pacific Lutheran Lutes Puget Sound Loggers Whitman Blues Whitworth Pirates Individual sports[edit] The Seattle Open Invitational golf tournament was part of the PGA Tour from the 1930s to the 1960s. The GTE Northwest Classic was part of the Senior PGA Tour from 1986 to 1995, and the Boeing Classic since 2005. In addition, the 2015 U.S. Open was held at Chambers Bay, and several major tournaments were held at Sahalee Country Club. Pacific Raceways is a motorsports venue which has hosted the Northwest Nationals of the NHRA Mello Yello Drag Racing Series and a round of the Trans-Am Series. The WTA Seattle tennis tournament was part of the WTA Tour from 1977 to 1982. The Climate Pledge Arena has hosted several mixed martial arts events, such as UFC Fight Night: Nogueira vs. Davis, UFC on Fox: Henderson vs. Diaz, and UFC on Fox: Johnson vs. Moraga. Symbols, honors, and names[edit] Reverse side of the Washington state quarter Four ships of the United States Navy, including two battleships, have been named USS Washington in honor of the state. Previous ships had held that name in honor of George Washington. The Evergreen State[edit] The state's nickname, ""The Evergreen State"",[1][218] was proposed in 1890 by Charles T. Conover of Seattle. The name proved popular as the forests were full of evergreen trees and the abundance of rain keeps the shrubbery and grasses green throughout the year.[219] Although the nickname is widely used by the state, appearing on vehicle license plates for instance, it has not been officially adopted.[1] The Evergreen State College, a state-funded institution in Olympia, also takes its name from this nickname. State symbols[edit] Main article: List of Washington state symbols The state song is ""Washington, My Home"", the state bird is the American goldfinch, the state fruit is the apple, and the state vegetable is the Walla Walla sweet onion.[220] The state dance, adopted in 1979, is the square dance. The state tree is the western hemlock. The state flower is the coast rhododendron. The state fish is the steelhead.[1] The state folk song is ""Roll On, Columbia, Roll On"" by Woody Guthrie. The unofficial, but popularly accepted, state rock song is Louie Louie.[221] The state grass is bluebunch wheatgrass. The state insect is the green darner dragonfly. The state gem is petrified wood. The state fossil is the Columbian mammoth. The state marine mammal is the orca. The state land mammal is the Olympic marmot.[1] The state seal (featured in the state flag as well) was inspired by the unfinished portrait of President George Washington by Gilbert Stuart.[222] See also[edit] Pacific Northwest portal United States portal Index of Washington-related articles Outline of Washington Notes[edit] ^ Including Mandarin and Cantonese References[edit] ^ a b c d e ""State Symbols"".

The Rush-Bagot Pact was an agreement between the United States and Great Britain to eliminate their fleets from the Great Lakes, excepting small patrol vessels. The Convention of 1818 set the boundary between the Missouri Territory in the United States and British North America (later Canada) at the forty-ninth parallel. Both agreements reflected the easing of diplomatic tensions that had led to the War of 1812 and marked the beginning of Anglo-American cooperation. ^ ""A Question of Boundaries"".

The missionaries Marcus Whitman, a doctor, and Narcissa Whitman, his wife, and twelve other members of the Waiilatpu Mission were murdered in November 1847 by a small contingent of the Cayuse Indians in the Oregon Territory. The murders became known as the “Whitman Massacre.” The authors examine the historical record, including archived correspondence held at the Yale University Libraries and elsewhere, for evidence of what motivated the killings and demonstrate that there were two valid perspectives, Cayuse and white. Hence, the event is better termed the “Whitman Tragedy.” A crucial component, a highly lethal measles epidemic, has been called the spark that lit the fuse of the tragedy. ^ Williams, David B.

The School was established in 1985 under the name 'School of Accountancy'. Its name was changed in 2008 to better reflect its program offering.[3] Today, more than 1,600 students are enrolled in the School's programs. In September 2009, a new 52,000 square feet (5,000 m2) building was officially opened to house the School. The School of Accounting and Finance offers the largest accounting and finance undergraduate cooperative education (co-op) program in Canada.[4] The School's Master of Accounting (MAcc) Program allows students to complete all required Chartered Professional Accountant (CPA) modules within eight months, and is only open to students who complete the School's undergrad programs. MAcc graduates only need to challenge (and pass) the Common Final Examination and accumulate the required professional experiences in order to become a CPA. MAcc and industry experiences gained from co-op is well known among Canadian accounting and finance industries. In June 2021, it was announced that the School and the Faculty of Environment will begin offering a new undergrad program, ""Sustainability and Financial Management"", and accept its first cohort of students starting Fall 2022. The program was created to prepare a new generation of accounting and finance professionals to lead businesses through an era of environmental sustainability, and to respond to the increasing importance of environmental finance and ESG factors.[5] Contents 1 Programs of Study 2 Undergraduate Education 3 Postgraduate Education 4 School Reputation and Achievement 4.1 Co-op Success 4.2 UFE/CFE Honour Roll and Gold Medalists 4.3 CFA Institute Research Challenge 5 Student life 6 Notable alumni and faculty 7 See also 8 References Programs of Study[edit] The School of Accounting and Finance offers four undergraduate programs, two graduate programs and one doctoral program. Additionally, the School jointly administers one undergraduate program and one graduate program with the Faculty of Mathematics and one undergraduate program with the Faculty of Science.[6] The Bachelor of Accounting and Financial Management (BAFM) and Bachelor of Computing and Financial Management (BCFM) degrees are both CFA Institute's University Affiliated Programs, which recognize academic institutions that embed a significant portion of the CFA Program Candidate Body of Knowledge (CBOK) into their curriculum.[7] Undergraduate Education[edit] Bachelor of Accounting and Financial Management Co-op (BAFM): Graduates of the BAFM program typically aspire to a host of professional accounting and/or finance credentials such as the Chartered Professional Accountant (CPA), Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) and Chartered Business Valuator (CBV) designations. All BAFM graduates are eligible to apply to the School's Master of Accounting (MAcc) program. Students in BAFM must complete four co-op work terms, in total of 16 months of experiences, which could be eligible for CPA accreditation purposes (30 months required). AFM Specializations: The Accounting and Financial Management (AFM) program offers 6 specializations in areas such as public accounting, finance, entrepreneurship, sustainability, Business analytics, and corporate governance. The first two years at AFM is focused on laying the foundations in accounting and finance, with a focus in people skills, learning, and academic success. The initiative includes experiential learning opportunities such as events, workshops, interactive webcasts, and team-based problem-solving situations connected to courses and extra-curricular situations. Students must then select a specialization from the list below in their 3rd and 4th year:[8] Professional Accountant Career Specialization Entrepreneurial Mindset Career Specialization Financial Leadership Career Specialization Financial Markets Career Specialization Business Analytics Career Specialization Sustainability Career Specialization Students may choose two specializations at most. Mathematics/Chartered Professional Accountancy Co-op (Math/CPA): Math/CPA students have less flexibility in their degree as students take math courses along with the accounting and finance courses BAFM students take, leaving very few elective spaces. The work-term sequence is structured similar to the BAFM schedule, with 4 co-op terms. The Math/CA program was renamed to Math/CPA in 2013. Biotechnology/Chartered Professional Accountancy Co-op (Biotech/CPA): This program is offered jointly with the Faculty of Science. Students in the Biotech/CPA program take science courses along with the accounting and finance courses. Biotech/CPA students have little flexibility in their degree, and in some terms, are required to take extra courses. Biotech/CPA students composed of the smallest population in the School, with only around 10-15 students admitted per academic year. Students in the program may obtain co-op employment deemed by professional bodies to be qualifying practical experience for accreditation purposes, similar to BAFM and Math/CPA, with 4 required co-op terms. Biotech/CPA students are eligible to apply to the School's MAcc program. The Biotech/CA program was renamed to Biotech/CPA in 2013. Bachelor of Computing and Financial Management (BCFM): This program is offered jointly with the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science in the Faculty of Mathematics. Students take computer science courses along with accounting and finance courses. Stronger emphasis is placed upon computer science and finance, less on accounting. The students receive a unique degree in Canada, ""Bachelor of Computing and Financial Management"" after graduation. Students in this program typically complete six co-op work terms, with the first commencing between semester two and three. CFM students/graduates are not eligible to apply to the School's MAcc program and are unable to take advantage of the CPA accreditation. Postgraduate Education[edit] Master of Accounting (MAcc): This 8-month program is accredited by CPA Canada, so students who successfully complete the program, including all CPA requirements, are exempt from all 6 modules of the CPA Professional Education Program and may proceed directly to the Common Final Examination (CFE).[9] Aside from gaining depth in the CPA elective subjects including Taxation, Assurance, Performance Management and Finance, MAcc students can explore other career options such as business valuations, forensic accounting, data analytics, internal audit and international tax. Approximately 65% of undergrads pursue the MAcc degree in 2016.[10] Furthermore, students who have taken and passed ACC606 Business Valuations receive advanced standings in the CBV Institute Programme of Studies. Students will receive exemptions for Level I – Introductory Business Valuation and Level II – Intermediate Business Valuation.[11] Master of Taxation (MTax): The Master of Taxation program is open to all students from different backgrounds to apply. MTax is offered under a full-time basis (1 year + 1 co-op term) or a part-time basis (2 years).[12] Graduates attain broad-based competencies in tax subject areas that include policy, research, statutory interpretation, estate planning, business structuring, and risk management, with all the classes held in downtown Toronto's Eaton Centre.[13] Master of Quantitative Finance (MQF): Focuses on the fundamental disciplines of mathematics, statistics, econometrics, computer science and finance. This program is offered jointly with Faculty of Mathematics. PhD in Accounting: The University of Waterloo's School of Accounting and Finance can provide doctoral training in research that is based on economic theory, empirical economics, behavioural science, and other methodologies. School Reputation and Achievement[edit] According to QS World University Rankings, School of Accounting and Finance ranks 101-150 globally in 2021 for the subject category of Accounting & Finance.[14] SAF also ranks high in the 2019 Global Accounting Research Survey conducted by Brigham Young University:[15] An overall ranking of 2nd in Canada and 10th globally for accounting research 1st in Canada for accounting information systems research 1st in Canada for managerial accounting research 1st in Canada for tax research 2nd in Canada for financial accounting research 2nd in Canada in Accounting PhD programs 3rd in Canada in audit research Co-op Success[edit] With co-operative education, many students secured full-time employment before graduation. In 2017, 100% of MTax graduates were employed before graduation, while 98% of AFM, Biotech/CPA, Math/CPA and MAcc students found employment within 6 months after graduation. The co-op employment rate has been consistently at around 97% to 100% with the students placed in Big Four accounting firms, chartered banks, government, non-profit organizations, and non-financial institutions with roles such as staff accountant, financial analyst, tax analyst, investment banker, private equity analyst, data science intern and trader.[16] UFE/CFE Honour Roll and Gold Medalists[edit] See also: Common Final Examination The School of Accounting & Finance has had success in its students and faculty research. Notably, many students who have challenged the Common Final Examination achieve honour roll as well as gold medal (Ontario and National).[17] The National Honour Roll of the Common Final Exam recognizes candidates whose performance in the exam demonstrated academic excellence and exceptional abilities. The candidates listed on the Honour Roll are determined as the top 1% of the first-time writers who wrote all three days.[18] In 2018 and 2019, SAF captured the National Gold Medal (highest CFE score in Canada) consecutively. SAF has obtained 6 national gold medals (best performance in Canada) from the period between 2010 and 2020.[19] The CFE honour roll and successful CFE writers are mostly the Master of Accounting students. From 2018 to 2020, SAF students accounted for 23.5%, 18.5% and 18.9% of the Honour Roll recipients respectively - the best performance in Canada.

The exam was not held in Ontario due to COVID-19 Pandemic. CFA Institute Research Challenge[edit] In 2016, School of Accounting & Finance students became the first Canadian team to win the global annual CFA Institute Research Challenge. The CFA Institute Research Challenge leverages the efforts of over 140 CFA member societies, 3,500 member volunteers, and more than 5,000 students from over 1,000 universities. The CFA Institute Research Challenge requires student teams (1 team per university) to research and analyze a publicly-traded company and then write a research report on their assigned company with a buy, sell, or hold recommendation.[20][21] In 2021, School of Accounting & Finance was once again awarded the Americas Regional Champion at the 2021 CFA Institute Research Challenge, where 5,000 students across 950 universities and 82 countries participated virtually.[22] Student life[edit] Aside from the clubs/societies available within the University of Waterloo, there are various extra-curricular activities available to SAF students only.[23][24] The Accounting and Finance Student Association (AFSA) is the government body for the SAF undergrad students, divided into many sub-committees. AFSA is run and governed by a fully-elected Executive Team and a partially-elected Board of Directors.[25] SAF also holds a student-run orientation week for first year undergrad students after the regular Waterloo orientation week, Accounting and Finance Orientation Week (AFOW). Furthermore, ACE Consulting Group is also a SAF student-run consulting organization that provides Kitchener-Waterloo entrepreneurs and small business clients with professional consulting services.[26] The School of Accounting and Finance Outreach & Ambassador Program (SOAP) is a year-long program for current SAF students to represent the School in recruiting, marketing, and connecting with future prospective students.[27] Other initiatives in relation to SAF academic learning include: Student Investment Fund[28] Student Venture Fund[29] Young Tax Professionals[30] David T.

The main campus is on 404 hectares (998 acres) of land adjacent to ""Uptown"" Waterloo and Waterloo Park. The university also operates three satellite campuses and four affiliated university colleges.[10][11] The university offers academic programs administered by six faculties and thirteen faculty-based schools. Waterloo operates the largest post-secondary co-operative education program in the world, with over 20,000 undergraduate students enrolled in the university's co-op program.[12] Waterloo is a member of the U15, a group of research-intensive universities in Canada.[13] The institution originates from the Waterloo College Associate Faculties, established on 4 April 1956; a semi-autonomous entity of Waterloo College, which was an affiliate of the University of Western Ontario.[14] This entity formally separated from Waterloo College and was incorporated as a university with the passage of the University of Waterloo Act by the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in 1959.[2] It was established to fill the need to train engineers and technicians for Canada's growing postwar economy. It grew substantially over the next decade, adding a faculty of arts in 1960, and the College of Optometry of Ontario (now the School of Optometry and Vision Science), which moved from Toronto in 1967.[2] The university is a co-educational institution, with approximately 36,000 undergraduate and 6,200 postgraduate students enrolled there in 2020.[4] Alumni and former students of the university can be found across Canada and in over 150 countries; with a number of award winners, government officials, and business leaders having been associated with Waterloo.[11] Waterloo's varsity teams, known as the Waterloo Warriors, compete in the Ontario University Athletics conference of the U Sports.

While the main source of income for higher education in Ontario at the time was the provincial government, the Ontario government made it clear it would not contribute to denominational colleges and universities.[16] Hagey soon became aware of the steps undertaken by McMaster University to make itself eligible for some provincial funding by establishing Hamilton College as a separate, non-denominational college affiliated with the university.[16] Following that method, Waterloo College established the Waterloo College Associate Faculties on 4 April 1956, as a non-denominational board affiliated with the college.[1] The academic structure of the Associated Faculties was originally focused on co-operative education in the applied sciences—largely built around the proposals of Ira Needles. Needles proposed a different approach towards education, including both studies in the classroom and training in industry that would eventually become the basis of the university's co-operative education program.[17] While the plan was initially opposed by the Engineering Institute of Canada and other Canadian universities, notably the University of Western Ontario, the Associated Faculties admitted its first students in July 1957.[18] On 25 January 1958, the Associated Faculties announced the purchase of over 74 hectares (180 acres) of land west of Waterloo College. By the end of the same year, the Associated Faculties opened its first building on the site, the Chemical Engineering Building.[19] ""The greatest product which we will realize from our electronic era is the better educated race. This applies to all fields – not just the field of science."" — Ira Needles, 1956[20][21] In 1959, the Legislative Assembly of Ontario passed an act which formally split the Associated Faculties from Waterloo College, and re-established it as the University of Waterloo.[22] The governance was modeled on the University of Toronto Act of 1906, which established a bicameral system of university government consisting of a senate, responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors exercising exclusive control over financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters. The president, appointed by the board, was to act as the institution's chief executive officer and act as a liaison between the two groups.[23] Wes Graham (right) with an IBM computer, Waterloo was one of the first universities in North America to establish a department of computer science. The legislative act was the result of a great deal of negotiation between Waterloo College, Waterloo College Associated Faculties, and St. Jerome's College, another denominational college in the City of Waterloo. While the agreements sought to safeguard the two denominational colleges, they also aimed at federating them with the newly established University of Waterloo.[24] Due to disagreements with Waterloo College, the college was not formally federated with the new university. The dispute centred on a controversially worded section of the University of Waterloo Act, 1959, in which the College interpreted certain sections as a guarantee it would become the Faculty of Art for the new university. This was something the Associated Faculties were not prepared to accept.[25] As a result of the controversy, Waterloo College's entire Department of Mathematics broke from the college to join the newly established University of Waterloo, later joined by professors from the Economic, German, Modern Languages, and Russian departments.[26] Despite this controversy, until 1960 Hagey hoped for a last-minute compromise between Waterloo College and the university. Ultimately, however, the university created its own Faculty of Arts in 1960.[27] It later established the first Faculty of Mathematics in North America on 1 January 1967.[28] In 1967, the world's first department of kinesiology was created.[29] The present legislative act which defines how the university should be governed, the University of Waterloo Act, 1972 was passed on 10 May 1972.[30] A coat of arms has been in use by the university since 1961. The coat of arms was officially registered with the Lord Lyon King of Arms in 1987 and with the Canadian Heraldic Authority in 2001.[31][32] In February 1995, the former president of the university, James Downey, signed the Tri-University Group (TUG) agreement between Wilfrid Laurier University, and the University of Guelph. Signed in a period of fiscal constraint, and when ageing library systems required replacing, the TUG agreement sought to integrate the library collections and services of the three universities.[33] Twenty-first century[edit] In 2001, the university announced it would develop the Waterloo Research and Technology Park in the north campus. The park was planned to house many of the high-tech industries in the area, and is supported by the university, the Regional Municipality of Waterloo, the provincial and federal governments, and Canada's Technology Triangle.[34] The aim was to provide businesses with access to the university's faculty, co-operative education students, and alumni, as well as the university's infrastructure and resources.[35] Groundbreaking was on 25 June 2002, with the first completed building, the Sybase campus building, opening on 26 November 2004.[36] In 2010, the Waterloo Research and Tech Park was renamed as the David Johnston Research and Technology Park, after David Johnston, the 28th Governor General of Canada and former president of the university.[37] From 2009 to 2012, the university managed four undergraduate programs in Dubai.[38] The university worked in partnership with the Higher Colleges of Technology, the largest post-secondary institution in the United Arab Emirates. Discussions regarding the partnership emerged in 2004, and the Dubai campus was officially opened in September 2009.[39] Through the partnership, the university offered undergraduate degrees in chemical engineering, civil engineering, financial analysis and risk management, and information technology management.[40] The programs offered in Dubai took place in facilities provided by the Higher Colleges of Technology.[41] On 30 October 2012, the university's Board of Governors decided to close the university's extension in Dubai.[38] Campus[edit] Completed in 1850, the Brubacher House is one of the oldest buildings on campus. The farmhouse was acquired by the university in 1965.[42]The university's main campus lies within the city of Waterloo, Ontario. It sits on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishnaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples that is part of the Haldimand Tract, land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River.[43] It is bordered by Waterloo Park to the south, Wilfrid Laurier University to the southeast, residential neighbourhoods to the northeast, east and west, and the Laurel Creek Conservation Area to the northwest. Three numbered roads also intersect the main campus: University Avenue West, Columbia Street West, and Westmount Road North.[44] While the main campus is 404 hectares (998 acres), the majority of the teaching facilities are centred on a ring road in its southern portion.[6] The oldest building on campus is the Graduate House, originally a farmhouse dating back to the 19th century. The oldest building which was erected for the university is the Douglas Wright Engineering Building, which was erected in 1958.[45] A large majority of the university's buildings, and its ring road, were constructed during the 1960s.[6] The university's main campus is divided into three major areas: South Campus, North Campus and Northwest Campus. South Campus is the academic core of the university, while North Campus holds the Research and Technology Park. Northwest Campus is the least developed area of the main campus, made up primarily of farm fields and an environmental reserve, which divides it from North Campus.[6] In addition, the university owns several other properties in Cambridge, Huntsville, Kitchener, and Stratford, Ontario. The Ion rapid transit system provides a transit connection between the main campus, and several off-campus facilities, including the university's start-up incubator program in Kitchener.[46] Panoramic view of the main campus from the field south of BC Matthews Hall Libraries and museums[edit] The Dana Porter Library, home to a collection of books focused on the Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences. The university has four libraries housing more than 1.4 million books, as well as electronic resources including e-books, serial titles, and databases.[47] Three libraries are on campus: the Dana Porter Library, housing material relating to arts, humanities and social science, the Davis Centre Library, housing material for engineering, mathematics and science, and the Witer Learning Resource Centre, housing material for the School of Optometry and Vision Science. The fourth library, the Musagetes Architecture Library, is in Cambridge, alongside the university's School of Architecture. The libraries of the university's affiliated colleges are also considered a part of the university's library system.[48] Doris E Lewis was the first University Librarian.[49] The university's library system is also a member of the TriUniversity Group, a partnership between the University of Guelph, University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University. The group provides students and researchers at all three universities with access to all of the collections and services.[50] The group also operates the TUG Annex, a repository for less-used library resources from the three universities.[48] University of Waterloo also operates the Earth Sciences Museum, on campus in the Centre for Environmental Information Technology.[51] It is mainly used as an earth-science teaching museum for local schools and natural-science interest groups in southern Ontario. The main exhibits cover the Great Lakes, rocks and minerals, dinosaurs and ice age mammals. The museum's dinosaur exhibit includes a complete cast of an Albertosaurus.[52] The museum also houses an interactive, simulation mining tunnel which aims to teach sustainable mining practices.[53] Also owned and operated by the university is the Museum of Vision Science, which is at the university's School of Optometry building. The university had previously operated the Elliott Avedon Museum and Archive of Games, created by the Department of Recreation and Leisure Studies and previously managed by the university's Faculty of Applied Health Sciences. Due to a lack of specific academic interest, in 2009, the decision was made to close the museum and transfer the collection elsewhere.[54] Housing and student facilities[edit] Minota Hagey Residence, one of eight residences at the university's main campus The university has eight student residences: the Minota Hagey Residence, UW Place, Village 1 (the university's first residence), Ron Eydt Village, Mackenzie King Village, Columbia Lake North and South, and Claudette Millar Hall. In addition to the eight main campus residences, students may also apply to live at any of the university's affiliated college residences. The first residence built was Village 1, completed in 1966.[55] Ron Eydt Village was still known as Village 2 in 1995 but had been renamed by 2000.[55] The largest residential village at the university is UW Place, which houses 1,300 first-year students and 350 upper-year students, while the smallest residence is the Minota Hagey Residence, which houses 70 students and is almost exclusively for upper-year students.[56][57] In September 2010, 24.9 percent of the undergraduate population lived on campus, including 71.1 percent of first-year students.[58] Residents are represented by two residential councils at the university, South Council which represents the students at UW Place, and North Council which represents the remaining residential villages. Each council organizes their own events and has their own executive, budget, and meetings.[59] However, the overall mission of both councils is to act as the official representatives for all residents living at the university's residences.[60] Exterior of the Student Life Centre with the Mike & Ophelia Lazaridis Quantum-Nano Centre in the background The Student Life Centre is the centre of student governance and student directed social, cultural, entertainment and recreational activities, open seven days a week, year-round. The Student Life Centre contains the offices of a number of student organizations, including the Waterloo Undergraduate Student Association (WUSA), Student Housing Office, a number of retail and food services, and a variety of club space and study rooms.[61] In 2017 ground broke on a joint 63,000 square foot expansion of the Student Life Centre and Physical Activities Complex. Built to the west of Burt Matthews Hall Green the expansion will connect all three floors with the Red North corner of the PAC providing social, fitness, study, multi-faith, dining, and bookable spaces for students. The project was initially projected to complete in Fall 2018;[62] although has not been completed as of 2021.[63] The WUSA also operates an information desk in the Student Life Centre called the Turnkey Desk. It is open 24/7 365, and it is where students go to book out study spaces within the SLC, as well as where they go for information on campus events, directions, and any questions students have. The Turnkey Desk also sells a variety of tickets including GO Transit tickets and various local transit tickets and movie theatre tickets. It is staffed almost entirely by university students or recent graduates, and is a salaried job on the campus. The idea for a student centre emerged during the 1960s, and to raise the necessary funds for the building students began to levy a $10 fee. Construction began in July 1966 and was completed in 1968. Tensions between the university and the student community surfaced over the management and ownership of the Student Life Centre. The conflict was not resolved until 1969, when Professor Johnson resigned his position as chairman of the Campus Centre Board, along with his colleague Pim Fitzgerald.[64] Off-campus facilities[edit] The university's School of Pharmacy based in Kitchener The university has several satellite campuses and facilities throughout Southern Ontario. The closest off-campus facilities are adjacent to the campus, with the university acquiring land and five buildings from BlackBerry Ltd in December 2013.[65] As of February 2014, the university uses three of the buildings, and leases the other two to BlackBerry Ltd.[66] The Centre for Extended Learning in Kitchener, Ontario is a facility owned and managed by the university.[67] The centre provides pre-university courses, part-time studies, online learning and professional development courses.[68] In addition to the Centre for Extended Learning, Kitchener also holds the university's School of Pharmacy. The pharmacy building was designed by Siamak Hariri, and was completed in December 2008.[69] While the School of Pharmacy acts as the anchor institution of this campus, other students and faculty of the university's Faculty of Applied Health Sciences also use the facilities.[70] The campus includes a primary care teaching clinic which will integrate clinical care and teaching in pharmacy and optometry. Two other universities also make use of the Health Science and Pharmacy campus. McMaster University's medical school makes use of the campus as its base for its Waterloo Regional Campus, with 56 of the medical school's students admitted at the regional campus in 2012. Wilfrid Laurier University's School of Social Work also uses some of the facilities available on the campus.[71] The university also operates the Stratford School of Interaction Design and Business in Stratford, Ontario. The focus for the Stratford campus is on education in digital arts and media. The idea for the Stratford campus first took shape when the City of Stratford and the university signed a memorandum in October 2006. It officially opened in September 2010.[72] In November 2009, the university also signed a memorandum of understanding with the University of Western Ontario regarding academic initiatives at the Stratford Campus.[73] The campus also hosted the first four Canada 3.0 forums, before its move to Toronto in 2012.[74] Main building in Cambridge, OntarioTrastevere studio, RomeThe university's School of Architecture operates from several off-campus facilities The university's School of Architecture uses a campus in Cambridge, Ontario, on the west bank of the Grand River.[75] The architecture campus was the idea of the Cambridge Consortium, a group of Cambridge business owners, who spearheaded the school's fundraising drive to cover a portion of the $27 million cost[clarification needed] of creating the new campus. The school, along with its faculty and students, was moved to the new campus in September 2004.[75] Since 1979, the School of Architecture has also operated an architecture studio in Rome, Italy in the Trastevere neighbourhood. The opportunity to work at the Trastevere studio is offered to fourth-year architecture students.[76] Other facility which is owned and managed by the university include the Waterloo Summit Centre for the Environment, in Huntsville, Ontario. It is a year-round research and teaching centre, which regularly hosts post-secondary student field courses and professional development programs, and also serves as a university outreach facility for the whole region.[77][78] Close to Algonquin and Arrowhead Provincial Park, the centre's facilities are used for research in ecological restoration and conservation.[79] Sustainability[edit] Sustainability initiatives are divided between several departmental offices at the university, with the university's plant operations charged with their implementation.[80] Prior to 2005, the management of sustainability efforts was conducted by the university's waste management coordinator.[81] The university's sustainability initiatives are solely institution-specific, as it has not signed any national or international sustainability declaration.[82] However, the university, along with the other members from the Council of Ontario Universities, signed a pledge in 2009 known as Ontario Universities Committed to a Greener World, with the objective of transforming its campus into a model of environmental responsibility.[83] The university's School of Environment, Enterprise and Development placed first in Canada in the Corporate Knights 2011 ranking for undergraduate business programs incorporating sustainability.[84] The university campus received a C+ grade from the Sustainable Endowments Institute on its College Sustainability Report Card for 2011.[85] In 2021, the University of Waterloo was ranked 99th in the world, and 15th in Canada in Times Higher Education University Impact Rankings, a ranking that evaluated 1,115 universities from 94 countries/regions against the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. A dramatic drop from 2020's ranking of 16th in the world.[86] Waterloo's Institute for Nanotechnology is Canada's largest nanotechnology institute committed to the UN Sustainable Development Goals.[87] Administration[edit] The university operates under a bicameral system of a board of governors and a senate, as legislated by the University of Waterloo Act, 1972.[88] The Board of Governors has responsibility for the university's properties, affairs, and income.[89] The University of Waterloo Act calls for only 36 members, each of whom must hold Canadian citizenship. However, the number of members in the board for the 2013–2014 academic year is 40.[90][91] The Board has five ex officio members, including the university's chancellor and president, and the mayors of Kitchener and Waterloo.[90] The other 32 members of the board are either elected or appointed by the various members of the university community, including alumni, faculty, and student body.[91] The senate establishes the educational policies of the university and makes recommendations to the board of governors in the management of the institution.[92] The senate has 24 ex officio positions, including the university's president and chancellor, the vice-presidents, the senior dean of each faculty, the presidents of the undergraduate, graduate, and faculty associations, and the presidents and principals of the university's associated colleges. The senate's 61 other members are appointed or elected by various communities of the university including the faculty of the university, its associated colleges, the student body, and alumni.[93] The president, appointed by the board of governors, acts as the university's chief executive officer with the senate's approval, administers the affairs of the university, and acts on behalf of the board with respect to the operational management and control of the university. The president is the chair of the senate and a member of the board.[94] The president also holds the position of vice-chancellor, assuming the duties of the chancellor during his absences or a temporary vacancy in the office.[95] The chancellor is elected by the members of the senate for a three-year term, although eligible for renewal. The chancellor's primary duty is to preside at all convocations and present candidates for honorary degrees to the senate.[95] Dominic Barton has been the chancellor since 27 Oct 2018.[96] He succeeded Tom Jenkins, who held the position since 1 May 2015.[97] In March 2011, Feridun Hamdullahpur was announced as the sixth president of the university, having been interim president since October 2010.[98] On November 17, 2020, Vivek Goel was announced as the seventh president of the university. His five-year term began on July 1, 2021.[99] Affiliated institutions[edit] Opening of Renison University College in 1959. The university college is one of three affiliated institutions of the University of Waterloo The university also includes three semi-autonomous affiliated colleges and a federated university. Conrad Grebel University College is a Mennonite university college that was chartered in 1961 and is religiously affiliated with the Mennonite Church Eastern Canada.[100] Renison University College is an Anglican university college chartered in 1959; it entered an affiliation with the University of Waterloo in 1960[101] and is religiously affiliated with the Anglican Church of Canada.[102] St. Jerome's University is a Roman Catholic university, founded in 1865, which entered into a federation with the University of Waterloo shortly after the provincial government granted it university status in 1959.[103] St. Paul's University College is a university college founded by members of the United Church of Canada in 1962. However, St. Paul's now operates independently from the United Church, without any formal or legal relationship.[104] The three colleges and federated university are all within the University of Waterloo's main campus and operate their own residences.[100][103][104][105] Students of these affiliated colleges and federated university are also academically integrated with the University of Waterloo. Students who study at any of them are also considered registered students of the University of Waterloo; with students from the federated universities able to enrol in classes and faculties, and graduate as a student from the University of Waterloo.[100][103][104][105] Regardless of the affiliated colleges and federated university's religious affiliations, enrolment is not restricted based on the student's religious beliefs.[106][107][108] Finances[edit] The university completed the 2014–2015 academic year with revenues of $936.240 million and expenses of $906.730 million, yielding a surplus of $29.510 million.[109] Grants and contracts make up the largest source of revenue for the university, totaling $392.357 million, followed by academic fees at $357.889 million. Salaries make up nearly half of the university's expenses, at $439.973 million.[109] As of 30 April 2015, the university's endowment is valued at $335.731 million.[109] Academics[edit] Waterloo is a publicly funded research university, and a member of the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada.[110][111] It functions on a term-based system, with fall, winter and spring terms.[112] Undergraduate programs comprise the majority of the school's enrolment, made up of 24,377 full-time and part-time undergraduate students. The university conferred 5,741 bachelor's degrees and first professional degrees, 1,605 master's degrees, 332 doctoral degrees, during the 2016–2017 academic school year.[113] The university is organized into six faculties, which operate a combined total of thirteen schools and over fifty academic departments. Faculties and Schools of the University of Waterloo Faculty Health Arts Engineering Environment Mathematics Science School School of Public Health and Health Systems School of Accounting and Finance Stratford School of Interaction Design and Business Balsillie School of International Affairs[b] Renison School of Social Work[c] School of Architecture Conrad School of Entrepreneurship and Business School of Environment, Enterprise and Development School of Environment, Resources and Sustainability School of Planning David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science School of Optometry and Vision Science School of Pharmacy The William G. Davis Computer Research Centre houses teaching facilities and a library for engineering, mathematics and science. Financial aid available to students includes the Ontario Student Assistance Program and Canada Student Loans and Grants through the federal and provincial governments. The financial aid provided may come in the form of loans, grants, bursaries, scholarships, fellowships, debt reduction, interest relief, and work programs.[114] The university has also partnered with other institutions for the purposes of jointly operating a graduate program. The Balsillie School of International Affairs (BSIA) is a graduate school and research centre operated in partnership with the Centre for International Governance Innovation and Wilfrid Laurier University. The Perimeter's Scholar International program is another graduate program operated in partnership with the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, in which its graduates receive a Master of Science from the University of Waterloo.[115] The university also offers its students the opportunity to earn credits towards their degree while studying abroad through student exchange and international internship programs.[116] The university has exchange agreements with over 100 institutions outside Canada.[117] Co-operative education[edit] The university operates the largest post-secondary co-operative education (co-op) program in the world with over 20,000 undergraduate students.[118][119][120][121] For co-op students, each term acts as either a study term or a work term depending on their co-op sequencing; typically for the entire length of their degree.[122] Co-op work terms are mandatory for all undergraduate engineering programs, as well as several arts and mathematics programs. Engineering students are required to complete five out their six scheduled work terms to graduate from their program, while students from other faculties typically need to complete four work terms.[123] Engineering students alternate between school and work terms, completing a total of eight study terms and six work terms in the span of four and two-thirds years.[122] However, some programs have unique co-op streams where consecutive school and work terms are scheduled near the end of the program, giving the students the opportunity to apply for eight-month positions.[124] The William M. Tatham Centre, home to the Centre for Career Action, and where employers visit campus to conduct interviews with co-op students. Students are responsible for securing their work placement for each of their co-op terms.[125] This includes applying for positions and attending interviews during their study terms. Scheduling conflicts between interviews and exams are actively avoided but still possible, in which case one or the other are rescheduled, with the examination taking precedence.[126] In order for the student to receive their co-op credit, their work term must meet a number of conditions. This includes being full-time, that it is related to the student's field of study, that it lasts for the full 16-week duration, and that it is compensated with at least the minimum wage in the location of work.[127] Exceptions can be made for some of these conditions; for example, first work terms often do not have to be related to the student's field of study, especially if the student has had difficulty securing a position. At the end of the work term, the employer submits a performance evaluation for the student which is presented to the student's future employers during their next application stage.[127] As of 2018, the university reports that its co-op students earn an average of CA$12,100 per work term when working in Canada.[128] However, co-op earnings vary greatly depending on field of study, how many work terms the student has already completed, and where the work term takes place. The university's highest earning undergraduate co-op students in 2018 were mathematics undergraduates (including computer science and computing and financial management) on their sixth work term and were working in the United States, who made an average of US$28,600 (C$38,000) per four-month work term.[129] Several programs where co-op is mandatory report high levels of employment from their graduation, with 98 percent of graduates from the Accounting and Financial Management, Math/CPA, Biotech/CPA, and Master of Accounting programs reporting that they found employment within six months after graduating.[130] In the same year, the graduates of the university's Master of Taxation co-op program reported that 100 percent of its students secured full-time employment prior to graduating.[130] The William M. Tatham Centre is the home of the Centre for Career Action office, where resources such as resume critiques, mock interviews, and networking advice are available.[131] It is also where most interviews with prospective employers take place, be it in-person, by phone, or through video conference.[citation needed] WaterlooWorks is the university's official job board,[132] on which over 7000 employers post available positions.[123] Most positions on WaterlooWorks are in Canada, although international job listings from employers based in the United States, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, and other countries have also been placed on WaterlooWorks.[133] The United States is the most common destination for international work terms. In addition to using WaterlooWorks, students may pursue their own external job search, or found their own company, to receive their co-op credit.

In QS's 2020 graduate employability ranking, Waterloo ranked 25th in the world, and second in Canada.[141] In the Times Higher Education 2020 graduate employability ranking, Waterloo was ranked 200th in the world, and ninth in Canada.[142] In an employability survey published by The New York Times in October 2011, when CEOs and chairpersons were asked to select the top universities which they recruited from, the university placed 108th in the world, and seventh in Canada.[143] In 2014, a study from Riviera Partners found that the University of Waterloo had the third-most hired undergraduate candidates in Silicon Valley.[144] In 2016, Startup Compass found that University of Waterloo alumni were the second-most frequently hired in small and medium-sized companies in Silicon Valley.[145] Dr. Steven Woods, engineering director at Google in Canada, said in 2013 that ""the University of Waterloo is one of Google's largest three or four recruiting universities year-over-year [worldwide], along with MIT and Carnegie Mellon.""[146] In 2014, Business Insider found via LinkedIn data that the University of Waterloo has the fourth-most alumni working at Facebook, and the third-most alumni working at Amazon.[147][148] Research[edit] The university's institutes for both nanotechnology and quantum computing are in the Mike & Ophelia Lazaridis Quantum-Nano Centre.[149] The University of Waterloo is a member of the U15, a group that represents 15 Canadian research universities. In 2018, Research Infosource ranked Waterloo 12th on their list of top 50 Canadian research universities, with a sponsored research income (external sources of funding) of $189.333 million in 2017.[150] In the same year, the university's faculty averaged a sponsored research income of $163,100, while graduate students averaged a sponsored research income of $34,700.[150] Research funds comes from private, and public sources. In 2019, the university has received over C$15 million in research funding from Huawei.[151] Waterloo's research performance has been noted several bibliometric university rankings, which uses citation analysis to evaluates the impact a university has on academic publications. In 2019, the Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities ranked Waterloo 242nd in the world, and 10th in Canada.[152] The University Ranking by Academic Performance 2018–19 rankings placed the university 191st in the world, and 10th in Canada.[153] The Balsillie School of International Affairs at the CIGI Campus. The institution is a graduate school and research centre established in partnership with Waterloo.[b]The university operates and manages 41 research centres and institutes, including the Centre for Applied Cryptographic Research, the Waterloo Institute for Nanotechnology, the Centre for Education in Mathematics and Computing, the Institute for Quantum Computing, and the Centre for Theoretical Neuroscience. Official recognition and designation of all centres and institutes requires the approval of the university's Senate.[154] On 6 April 2018, the University of Waterloo announced the launching of its Artificial Intelligence Institute.[155] The university has undertaken several research partnerships with other institutions. In 2007, the Balsillie School of International Affairs (BSIA) was established as a graduate school and research centre in partnership with the University of Waterloo.[b] BSIA operates three research centres relating to public governance and public policy.[156] In 2016, Facebook hardware development division announced a partnership with Waterloo, along with 16 other post-secondary institutions, as Facebook explores new revenue streams in virtual reality, cyber security, and other areas of research.[157] In 2019, Microsoft announced a partnership with Waterloo's Artificial Intelligence Institute worth $115 million over five years as part of Microsoft's broader AI For Good Initiative. Waterloo's Artificial Intelligence Institute is an interdisciplinary initiative involving the researchers from faculties of arts, engineering, mathematics, and computer science.[158] During the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers at the Waterloo Institute for Nanotechnology worked in collaboration with SiO2 Innovation Labs to develop a coating that kills the virus upon impact. The antiviral coating could be applied to all personal protective equipment and high-touch surfaces. This research was supported by both the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada and Mitacs.[159] Admission[edit] The requirements for admission differ between students from Ontario, students from other provinces in Canada, and international students, due to the lack of uniformity in marking schemes. The minimum averages required for these programs are determined each year based on the number and qualification of applicants and the number of available spaces.[160] As of 2016, the secondary school average for first year, full-time students at the University of Waterloo was at 90.1 percent.[161] In 2018, 61.2 percent of new students at Waterloo had a high school average equal to or greater than 90 percent, and 28.2 percent had an average equal to or greater than 95 percent.[162] However, this proportion varies greatly between programs at the university. In the case of admission into the Engineering and Math faculties, there is a large weighting given to the applicant's supplementary application, extracurricular involvement, adjustment factors for individual high schools, and an admissions video interview. Thus, it is possible to receive an offer with an average much lower than the mean admission average.[163] The retention rate of the university's first-time, full-time first-year students in 2016 was 93.9 percent.[164] Student life[edit] Demographics of student body (2017–18)[f] Undergraduate[g] Graduate Male[165] 52.7% 55.9% Female[166] 47.3% 44.1% Canadian student[167] 82.7% 63.9% International student[167] 17.3% 36.1% Organizations[edit] The university's two main student unions are the Waterloo Undergraduate Student Association (WUSA) for undergraduate students,[168] and the Graduate Student Association (GSA) for graduate students.[169] Founded in 1967 as the Federation of Students,[168] WUSA operates four businesses, twelve student services, oversees over 200 accredited student clubs;[170] in addition to operating other student programs and events. The Sedra Student Design Centre, where student design teams work on projects such as making an autonomous vehicle or a Hyperloop pod prototype. Each of the university's faculties has a student society which represent and provide services for the students in their respective faculties.[171] Services include online exam banks, resume critiques, and technical skills workshops. Some student societies also operate a student deal discount program and one to two shops selling coffee and food at low prices.[172] Each faculty also operates a student-run endowment fund, which fund student design teams, laboratory upgrades, and services for their respective student societies.[173][174] As of January 2015, neither the university administration nor the two main student unions recognize fraternities or sororities.[175] Alpha Epsilon Pi, Pi Kappa Alpha and Sigma Chi operate as non-accredited off-campus fraternities,[176][177][178] and Alpha Omicron Pi and Kappa Kappa Gamma as non-accredited off-campus sororities.[179][180] Journalism[edit] The three main student publications on campus are Imprint, the university's official student newspaper,[181] mathNEWS, the Math Society's free-form publication,[182] and The Iron Warrior, the Engineering Society's newspaper.[183] Imprint replaced The Chevron as the official student newspaper in 1979,[184] and publishes a weekly edition during the fall and winter semesters and a biweekly edition in the spring semester. mathNEWS and The Iron Warrior publish biweekly in print and online throughout the year. The university formerly included a student-funded campus radio station, CKMS-FM. The student union withdrew financial support for the stations' operations in 2008 following several referenda and CKMS transitioned to a community radio model.[185] Athletics[edit] Main article: Waterloo Warriors The Waterloo Warriors men's ice hockey team is one of several varsity sports teams operated by the university The university's sports teams are known as the Waterloo Warriors. They participate in the Canadian Interuniversity Sports' Ontario University Athletics conference for most varsity sports. Varsity teams include badminton, baseball, basketball, cross country, curling, field hockey, figure skating, Canadian football, golf, hockey, Nordic skiing, rugby, soccer, squash, swimming, track and field, tennis and volleyball. The athletics program at the university dates back to 1957, when students of Waterloo College Associate Faculties participated in the sports program of Waterloo College. The university had its own independent team when the Associate Faculties officially became the University of Waterloo.[186] The university's varsity teams and the university's recreational sports programs are operated and managed by the Department of Athletics and Recreational Activity.[187] The university has a number of athletic facilities open to varsity teams and other students. Seating 5,400 people, Warrior Field is the university's largest stadium by seating capacity; and is used as the home field for the varsity field hockey and football teams, and hosts the university's recreational flag football and soccer activities.[188] Prior to the completion of Warrior Field in 2008, the university's varsity teams used Seagram Stadium as their home stadium.[189] Seagram Stadium was built by the university's predecessor, Waterloo College Associate Faculties, and remained under the ownership of the university until 1974, when it was sold to the City of Waterloo.[189] However, the university continued to use Seagram Stadium until 2008.[189] Other facilities include the Physical Activity Complex, which houses two gymnasiums, beach volleyball courts, squash rooms, and a swimming pool, and is also home to the university's varsity badminton, basketball, squash, swimming and volleyball teams.[190] The Columbia Ice Field was constructed in 1983 and houses the university's hockey team home rink, with a seating capacity of 700. The Ice Field has been expanded twice, in 1990 and 2003, and now includes three gyms and a number of fitness centres.[191][192] Including the football field, the university manages seven outdoor playing fields, with Fields 1 and 2 reserved for the varsity soccer and rugby teams, while portions of Field 3 are used as a baseball field. The rest of the fields are used by the university's recreational sports programs.[193] Entrepreneurship[edit] The University of Waterloo operates a startup incubator for its students, faculty, and alumni called the Velocity program.[194] With no fees or equity, it is the largest free startup incubator in the world.[195] It offers office space for up to 120 startup companies, as well as a wet laboratory, assembly space, workshop, and prototyping lab. The program also provides business mentorship to its resident companies and to Waterloo students as well as partnerships with researchers at the university's main campus. Velocity provides some students and startups with grants, previously valued from C$5,000 to C$25,000. As of 2019, the $25,000 grant was removed and companies in Velocity may now pitch their ideas to instead receive C$50,000 in funding, with equity stakes from investors.[196] Companies that emerged from the Velocity program include Maluuba.[197] In addition to the resources provided by Velocity, alumni regularly receive funding for their startups from United States accelerators.[198] Companies Waterloo alumni have founded with the aid of Silicon Valley accelerator Y Combinator include Pebble[199] and Bufferbox.[200] Y Combinator founder Paul Graham and president Sam Altman have both noted the University of Waterloo has stood out to them more than any other school during Y Combinator applications.[201][202][203] In 2017, Pitchbook Data ranked the University of Waterloo's undergraduate program fourth for schools that have the greatest number of alumni who have founded unicorn startups.[204] As of the same year, Waterloo students and alumni have raised a cumulative US$3.662 billion in venture capital. The current unicorn startups from Waterloo are Wish, Instacart, Kik Messenger, Pivotal Software, and Storm8.[198] Insignias and other representations[edit] The University of Waterloo's coat of arms has been used as a symbol of the institution since 1961, with the coat of arms also being used in the logo of the university, and its academic faculties and departments.[205] The university's colours is black, gold, and white, and may be found on the university's coat of arms. A copy of the Porcellino sculpture outside the Modern Languages Building serves as a mascot for the Faculty of Arts The school also maintains official colours to represent the academic faculties of the university.[206] Other objects have also been used to represent the faculties of the university. Mathematics students have used pink ties to represent their faculty since 1968, when a 21 metres (68 ft) pink tie was placed on the exterior of the Mathematics & Computer Building during the building's opening.[207] A copy of the statue of Porcellino at the university's Modern Languages Building is also used as a mascot for the Faculty of Arts. The statue was donated to the university in 1978, and was placed at the Modern Languages Building.[208] Coat of Arms[edit] The university's coat of arms was first used by the university in October 1961, but was only officially granted by the Lord Lyon King of Arms in August 1987.[31] It was not registered with the Canadian Heraldic Authority until 15 February 2001.[209] Four variations of the coat of arms existed. The first was used from 1961 to 1996, when the second bright-yellow shield using slightly different shaped lions was introduced. The yellow background was dulled in 2000, and finally, the original lions were reintroduced in 2010 in conjunction with the attempt to replace the use of the coat of arms with a futuristic W logo.[210] The new logo was eventually rejected after student opposition.[211] The red-on-gold lions on the university's arms were adopted from those of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, who defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo.[210] The City of Waterloo was named after an area just south of Brussels, Belgium, where the battle occurred.[212] The chevron on the arms was taken from the arms of Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener, Field Marshal with the British Army during World War I. The black and white pattern used on the chevron was based on the colours of Prussia, as homage to the German heritage of the area.[210] The City of Kitchener was originally known as Berlin, but was renamed after Earl Kitchener in 1916 during World War I.[212] Motto and songs[edit] The university's Latin motto is Concordia cum veritate, translated as ""In Harmony with Truth"". It was introduced along with the university coat of arms in October 1961.[31] A number of songs are commonly played and sung at various events such as commencement, convocation, and athletic contests. The main song of the university is known as the ""Black and White and Gold"". The words were written by K. D. Fryer and H. F. Davis, while the music was composed by Alfred Kunz.[213] Notable alumni and faculty[edit] Main article: List of University of Waterloo people David Johnston, 28th Governor General of Canada Robert Mundell, Nobel laureate in economics Donna Strickland, Nobel laureate in physics Chris Hadfield, retired Canadian astronaut.

David Johnston, the former president of Waterloo, served as the 28th Governor General of Canada from 2010 to 2017.[230] A number of the university's faculty and students have also gained prominence in the field of computing sciences. Examples include QNX operating systems co-creators Gordon Bell and Dan Dodge,[231] Rasmus Lerdorf, the creator of the PHP scripting language,[232] Matei Zaharia, the creator of Apache Spark, Gordon Cormack, the co-creator of the Dynamic Markov compression algorithm,[233] Ric Holt, co-creator of several programming languages, most notably Turing,[234] Jack Edmonds, a computer scientist, and developer of the Blossom algorithm, and the Edmonds' algorithm,[235] and William Thomas Tutte, a World War II codebreaker who cracked the Nazi high command's Lorenz Cypher. Graduates from the university have also risen to prominence in other fields. Heather Moyse, a graduate from the kinesiology program, is a prominent Canadian athlete and two-time Olympic bobsleigh gold medalist.[236] Moyse has represented Canada in international bobsleigh, rugby and track cycling competitions.[237] Graduate of the Rhetoric and Professional Writing program, Rupi Kaur is a Canadian poet, writer, illustrator.[238] Her book of poetry, Milk and Honey, has spent over a year on The New York Times' bestsellers list, reaching No. 1 in January 2017.[239] George Elliott Clarke, who served as the Poet Laureate of Toronto from 2012 to 2015 and as the 2016–2017 Canadian Parliamentary Poet Laureate, graduated with an English degree. On 2 October 2018, Donna Strickland, an associate professor at the Physics and Astronomy Department, was awarded the Nobel prize in physics. Strickland is the third woman to have ever been awarded the prize in physics.[240] This was the first Nobel prize for a member of the university's faculty.[241] Strickland was honoured for being half of the team to discover chirped pulse amplification, a technique that underpins today's short-pulse, high-intensity lasers.[242][243] Scientific American explained the practical aspects of the invention as it applies in the most noteworthy application: it allows for ""ultrabrief, ultrasharp beams can be used to make extremely precise cuts, so their technique is now used in laser machining and enables doctors to perform millions of corrective"" laser eye surgeries.[244] See also[edit] Education portal Canada portal List of Canadian universities by endowment U15 Group of Canadian Research Universities List of Nobel laureates by country List of female Nobel laureates Midnight Sun Solar Race Team Waterloo Global Science Initiative Footnotes[edit] ^ The university was established under The University of Waterloo Act, 1959, which reorganized Waterloo College Associate Faculties into an independent university.

Ontario is bordered by the province of Manitoba to the west, Hudson Bay and James Bay to the north, and Quebec to the east and northeast, and to the south by the U.S. states of (from west to east) Minnesota, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York. Almost all of Ontario's 2,700 km (1,678 mi) border with the United States follows inland waterways: from the westerly Lake of the Woods, eastward along the major rivers and lakes of the Great Lakes/Saint Lawrence River drainage system. These include Rainy River, Pigeon River, Lake Superior, St. Marys River, Lake Huron, St. Clair River, Lake St. Clair, Detroit River, Lake Erie, Niagara River, Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River from Kingston, to the Quebec boundary just east of Cornwall. There is only about 1 km (0.6 mi) of land border, made up of portages including Height of Land Portage on the Minnesota border.[13] Ontario is sometimes conceptually divided into two regions, Northern Ontario and Southern Ontario. The great majority of Ontario's population and arable land is in the south. In contrast, the larger, northern part of Ontario is sparsely populated with cold winters and heavy forestation.[14] Contents 1 Etymology 2 Geography 2.1 Climate 3 History 3.1 Pre-European contact 3.2 European contact 3.3 Upper Canada 3.4 Canada West 3.5 Provincehood 3.6 Territorial evolution 4 Demographics 4.1 Religion 4.2 Language 5 Economy 5.1 Agriculture 5.2 Energy 6 Government, law and politics 6.1 Law 6.2 Politics 6.3 Administrative divisions 6.4 Urban areas 7 Education 7.1 Higher education 8 Culture 8.1 Songs and slogans 8.2 Professional sports 8.3 Notable residents 8.4 Museums 9 Transportation 9.1 Air travel 9.2 Railways 9.3 Roads 9.4 Waterways 10 See also 11 Notes 12 References 12.1 Citations 12.2 Sources 13 Further reading 14 External links Etymology[edit] The province is named after Lake Ontario, a term thought to be derived from Ontarí:io, a Huron (Wyandot) word meaning ""great lake"",[15] or possibly skanadario, which means ""beautiful water"" in the Iroquoian languages.[16] Ontario has about 250,000 freshwater lakes.[17] Geography[edit] Main article: Geography of Ontario See also: List of census divisions of Ontario, Geography of Canada, and List of parks and protected areas of Ontario Typical landscape of the Canadian Shield at Queen Elizabeth II Wildlands Provincial Park, located in Central Ontario The province consists of three main geographical regions: The thinly populated Canadian Shield in the northwestern and central portions, which comprises over half the land area of Ontario. Although this area mostly does not support agriculture, it is rich in minerals, partly covered by the Central and Midwestern Canadian Shield forests, and studded with lakes and rivers. Northern Ontario is subdivided into two sub-regions: Northwestern Ontario and Northeastern Ontario. The virtually unpopulated Hudson Bay Lowlands in the extreme north and northeast, mainly swampy and sparsely forested. Southern Ontario, which is further sub-divided into four sub-regions: Central Ontario (although not actually the province's geographic centre), Eastern Ontario, Golden Horseshoe and Southwestern Ontario (parts of which were formerly referred to as Western Ontario). Despite the absence of any mountainous terrain in the province, there are large areas of uplands, particularly within the Canadian Shield which traverses the province from northwest to southeast and also above the Niagara Escarpment which crosses the south. The highest point is Ishpatina Ridge at 693 metres (2,274 ft) above sea level in Temagami, Northeastern Ontario. In the south, elevations of over 500 m (1,640 ft) are surpassed near Collingwood, above the Blue Mountains in the Dundalk Highlands and in hilltops near the Madawaska River in Renfrew County. The Carolinian forest zone covers most of the southwestern region of the province. The temperate and fertile Great Lakes-Saint Lawrence Valley in the south is part of the Eastern Great Lakes lowland forests ecoregion where the forest has now been largely replaced by agriculture, industrial and urban development. A well-known geographic feature is Niagara Falls, part of the Niagara Escarpment. The Saint Lawrence Seaway allows navigation to and from the Atlantic Ocean as far inland as Thunder Bay in Northwestern Ontario. Northern Ontario covers approximately 87% of the province's surface area; conversely Southern Ontario contains 94% of the population. Point Pelee is a peninsula of Lake Erie in southwestern Ontario (near Windsor and Detroit, Michigan) that is the southernmost extent of Canada's mainland. Pelee Island and Middle Island in Lake Erie extend slightly farther. All are south of 42°N – slightly farther south than the northern border of California. Climate[edit] See also: Climate of Ontario Köppen climate types of Ontario Ontario's climate varies by season and location.[18] Three air sources affect it: cold, dry, arctic air from the north (dominant factor during the winter months, and for a longer part of the year in far northern Ontario); Pacific polar air crossing in from the western Canadian Prairies/US Northern Plains; and warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean.[19] The effects of these major air masses on temperature and precipitation depend mainly on latitude, proximity to major bodies of water and to a small extent, terrain relief.[19] In general, most of Ontario's climate is classified as humid continental.[19] Ontario has three main climatic regions: The surrounding Great Lakes greatly influence the climatic region of southern Ontario.[18] During the fall and winter, the release of heat stored by the lakes moderates the climate near the shores.[20] This gives parts of southern Ontario milder winters than mid-continental areas at lower latitudes.[20] Parts of Southwestern Ontario (generally south of a line from Sarnia–Toronto) have a moderate humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfa), similar to the inland Mid-Atlantic states and the Great Lakes portion of the Midwestern United States. The region has warm to hot, humid summers and cold winters. Annual precipitation ranges from 750–1,000 mm (30–39 in) and is well distributed throughout the year. Most of this region lies in the lee of the Great Lakes, making for abundant snow in some areas. In December 2010, the snowbelt set a new record when it was hit by more than a metre of snow within 48 hours.[21] The next climatic region is Central and Eastern Ontario, which has a moderate humid continental climate (Köppen Dfb). This region has warm and sometimes hot summers with colder, longer winters, ample snowfall (even in regions not directly in the snowbelts) and annual precipitation similar to the rest of Southern Ontario.[19] In the northeastern parts of Ontario, extending south as far as Kirkland Lake, the cold waters of Hudson Bay depress summer temperatures, making it cooler than other locations at similar latitudes. The same is true on the northern shore of Lake Superior, which cools hot, humid air from the south, leading to cooler summer temperatures.[19] Along the eastern shores of Lake Superior and Lake Huron winter temperatures are slightly moderated but come with frequent heavy lake-effect snow squalls that increase seasonal snowfall totals to upwards of 3 m (10 ft) in some places. These regions have higher annual precipitation, in some places over 100 cm (39 in). Cold northwesterly wind over the Great Lakes creating lake-effect snow. Lake-effect snow most frequently occurs in the snowbelt regions of the province. The northernmost parts of Ontario – primarily north of 50°N – have a subarctic climate (Köppen Dfc) with long, severely cold winters and short, cool to warm summers with dramatic temperature changes possible in all seasons. With no major mountain ranges blocking sinking Arctic air masses, temperatures of −40 °C (−40 °F) are not uncommon; snow remains on the ground for sometimes over half the year. Snow accumulation can be high in some areas.[18] Precipitation is generally less than 70 cm (28 in) and peaks in the summer months in the form of rain or thunderstorms.[18] Severe thunderstorms peak in summer. Windsor, in Southern (Southwestern) Ontario, has the most lightning strikes per year in Canada, averaging 33 days of thunderstorm activity per year.[22] In a typical year, Ontario averages 11 confirmed tornado touchdowns. However, over the last 4 years,[when?] it has had upwards of 20 tornado touchdowns per year, with the highest frequency in the Windsor-Essex – Chatham Kent area, though few are very destructive (the majority between F0 to F2 on the Fujita scale). Ontario had a record 29 tornadoes in both 2006 and 2009. Tropical depression remnants occasionally bring heavy rains and winds in the south, but are rarely deadly. A notable exception was Hurricane Hazel which struck Southern Ontario centred on Toronto, in October 1954.

Samuel de Champlain reached Lake Huron in 1615, and French missionaries began to establish posts along the Great Lakes. French settlement was hampered by their hostilities with the Iroquois, who allied themselves with the British.[37] From 1634 to 1640, Hurons were devastated by European infectious diseases, such as measles and smallpox, to which they had no immunity.[38] By 1700, the Iroquois had been driven out or left the area that would become Ontario and the Mississaugas of the Ojibwa had settled the north shore of Lake Ontario. The remaining Huron settled north of Quebec. The British established trading posts on Hudson Bay in the late 17th century and began a struggle for domination of Ontario with the French. After the French of New France were defeated during the Seven Years' War, the two powers awarded nearly all of France's North American possessions (New France) to Britain in the 1763 Treaty of Paris, including those lands of Ontario not already claimed by Britain. The British annexed the Ontario region to Quebec in 1774.[39] A monument in Hamilton commemorating the United Empire Loyalists, a group of settlers who fled the United States during or after the American Revolution The first European settlements were in 1782–1784 when 5,000 United Empire Loyalists entered what is now Ontario following the American Revolution.[40] The Kingdom of Great Britain granted them 200 acres (81 ha) land and other items with which to rebuild their lives.[37] The British also set up reserves in Ontario for the Mohawks who had fought for the British and had lost their land in New York state. Other Iroquois, also displaced from New York were resettled in 1784 at the Six Nations reserve at the west end of Lake Ontario. The Mississaugas, displaced by European settlements, would later move to Six Nations also. A second wave of Americans, not all of them necessarily loyalists moved to Upper Canada after 1790 until the pre-war of 1812, many seeking available cheap land, and at the time, lower taxation. The population of Canada west of the St. Lawrence-Ottawa River confluence substantially increased during this period, a fact recognized by the Constitutional Act of 1791, which split Quebec into the Canadas: Upper Canada southwest of the St. Lawrence-Ottawa River confluence, and Lower Canada east of it. John Graves Simcoe was appointed Upper Canada's first Lieutenant governor in 1793.[41] Upper Canada[edit] Main article: Upper Canada American troops in the War of 1812 invaded Upper Canada across the Niagara River and the Detroit River, but were defeated and pushed back by the British, Canadian fencibles and militias, and First Nations warriors. However, the Americans eventually gained control of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. The 1813 Battle of York saw American troops defeat the garrison at the Upper Canada capital of York. The Americans looted the town and burned the Upper Canada Parliament Buildings during their brief occupation. The British would burn the American capital of Washington, D.C. in 1814. Depiction of the Battle of Queenston Heights, during the War of 1812. Upper Canada was an active theatre of operation during the conflict. After the War of 1812, relative stability allowed for increasing numbers of immigrants to arrive from Europe rather than from the United States. As was the case in the previous decades, this immigration shift was encouraged by the colonial leaders. Despite affordable and often free land, many arriving newcomers, mostly from Britain and Ireland, found frontier life with the harsh climate difficult, and some of those with the means eventually returned home or went south. However, population growth far exceeded emigration in the following decades. It was a mostly agrarian-based society, but canal projects and a new network of plank roads spurred greater trade within the colony and with the United States, thereby improving previously damaged relations over time. Meanwhile, Ontario's numerous waterways aided travel and transportation into the interior and supplied water power for development. As the population increased, so did the industries and transportation networks, which in turn led to further development. By the end of the century, Ontario vied with Quebec as the nation's leader in terms of growth in population, industry, arts and communications.[42] Unrest in the colony began to chafe against the aristocratic Family Compact who governed while benefiting economically from the region's resources, and who did not allow elected bodies power. This resentment spurred republican ideals and sowed the seeds for early Canadian nationalism. Accordingly, rebellion in favour of responsible government rose in both regions; Louis-Joseph Papineau led the Lower Canada Rebellion and William Lyon Mackenzie, first Toronto mayor,[43] led the Upper Canada Rebellion. In Upper Canada, the rebellion was quickly a failure. William Lyon Mackenzie escaped to the United States, where he declared the Republic of Canada on Navy Island on the Niagara River.[44] Canada West[edit] Main article: Province of Canada A map highlighting the Canadas, with Upper Canada in orange, and Lower Canada in green. In 1841, the two colonies were united to form the Province of Canada. Although both rebellions were put down in short order, the British government sent Lord Durham to investigate the causes. He recommended self-government be granted and Lower and Upper Canada be re-joined in an attempt to assimilate the French Canadians. Accordingly, the two colonies were merged into the Province of Canada by the Act of Union 1840, with the capital at Kingston, and Upper Canada becoming known as Canada West.[45] Parliamentary self-government was granted in 1848. There were heavy waves of immigration in the 1840s, and the population of Canada West more than doubled by 1851 over the previous decade. As a result, for the first time, the English-speaking population of Canada West surpassed the French-speaking population of Canada East, tilting the representative balance of power. An economic boom in the 1850s coincided with railway expansion across the province, further increasing the economic strength of Central Canada. With the repeal of the Corn Laws and a reciprocity agreement in place with the United States, various industries such as timber, mining, farming and alcohol distilling benefited tremendously. A political stalemate between the French- and English-speaking legislators, as well as fear of aggression from the United States during and immediately after the American Civil War, led the political elite to hold a series of conferences in the 1860s to effect a broader federal union of all British North American colonies. The British North America Act took effect on July 1, 1867, establishing the Dominion of Canada, initially with four provinces: Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec and Ontario. The Province of Canada was divided into Ontario and Quebec so that each linguistic group would have its own province. Both Quebec and Ontario were required by section 93 of the British North America Act to safeguard existing educational rights and privileges of the Protestant and Catholic minorities. Thus, separate Catholic schools and school boards were permitted in Ontario. However, neither province had a constitutional requirement to protect its French- or English-speaking minority. Toronto was formally established as Ontario's provincial capital. Provincehood[edit] Oliver Mowat, Premier of Ontario from 1872 to 1896 Once constituted as a province, Ontario proceeded to assert its economic and legislative power. In 1872, the lawyer Oliver Mowat became Premier of Ontario and remained as premier until 1896. He fought for provincial rights, weakening the power of the federal government in provincial matters, usually through well-argued appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. His battles with the federal government greatly decentralized Canada, giving the provinces far more power than John A. Macdonald had intended. He consolidated and expanded Ontario's educational and provincial institutions, created districts in Northern Ontario, and fought to ensure that those parts of Northwestern Ontario not historically part of Upper Canada (the vast areas north and west of the Lake Superior-Hudson Bay watershed, known as the District of Keewatin) would become part of Ontario, a victory embodied in the Canada (Ontario Boundary) Act, 1889. He also presided over the emergence of the province into the economic powerhouse of Canada. Mowat was the creator of what is often called Empire Ontario. Beginning with Macdonald's National Policy (1879) and the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway (1875–1885) through Northern Ontario and the Canadian Prairies to British Columbia, Ontario manufacturing and industry flourished. However, population increases slowed after a large recession hit the province in 1893, thus slowing growth drastically but for only a few years. Many newly arrived immigrants and others moved west along the railway to the Prairie Provinces and British Columbia, sparsely settling Northern Ontario. Mineral exploitation accelerated in the late 19th century, leading to the rise of important mining centres in the northeast, such as Sudbury, Cobalt and Timmins. The province harnessed its water power to generate hydro-electric power and created the state-controlled Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario, later Ontario Hydro. The availability of cheap electric power further facilitated the development of industry. The Ford Motor Company of Canada was established in 1904 and the McLaughlin Motor Car Company (later General Motors Canada) was founded in 1907. The motor vehicle industry became the most lucrative industry for the Ontario economy during the 20th century. In July 1912, the Conservative government of James Whitney issued Regulation 17 which severely limited the availability of French-language schooling to the province's French-speaking minority. French Canadians reacted with outrage, journalist Henri Bourassa denouncing the ""Prussians of Ontario"". The regulation was eventually repealed in 1927. Law enforcement confiscate stores of alcohol in Elk Lake in an effort to enforce prohibition. The prohibition measures were introduced in 1916 and were not repealed until 1927. Influenced by events in the United States, the government of William Hearst introduced prohibition of alcoholic drinks in 1916 with the passing of the Ontario Temperance Act. However, residents could distil and retain their own personal supply, and liquor producers could continue distillation and export for sale, allowing this already sizeable industry to strengthen further. Ontario became a hotbed for the illegal smuggling of liquor and the biggest supplier into the United States, which was under complete prohibition. Prohibition in Ontario came to an end in 1927 with the establishment of the Liquor Control Board of Ontario under the government of Howard Ferguson. The sale and consumption of liquor, wine, and beer are still controlled by some of the most extreme laws in North America to ensure strict community standards and revenue generation from the alcohol retail monopoly are upheld. The post-World War II period was one of exceptional prosperity and growth. Ontario has been the recipients of most immigration to Canada, largely immigrants from war-torn Europe in the 1950s and 1960s and following changes in federal immigration law, a massive influx of non-Europeans since the 1970s. From a largely ethnically British province, Ontario has rapidly become culturally very diverse. A monument commemorating the immigrant family in Toronto. The province saw a large number of migrants settle in Ontario in the decades following World War II. The nationalist movement in Quebec, particularly after the election of the Parti Québécois in 1976, contributed to driving many businesses and English-speaking people out of Quebec to Ontario, and as a result, Toronto surpassed Montreal as the largest city and economic centre of Canada.[46] Depressed economic conditions in the Maritime Provinces have also resulted in de-population of those provinces in the 20th century, with heavy migration into Ontario.[47][48] Ontario's official language is English, although there exists a number of French-speaking communities across Ontario.[49] French-language services are made available for communities with a sizeable French-speaking population; a service that is ensured under the French Language Services Act of 1989. Territorial evolution[edit] Until 1763, most of Ontario was considered part of New France by French claim. Rupert's Land, defined as the drainage basin of Hudson Bay, was claimed by Britain, and included much of today's Northern Ontario. The British defeated the armies of the French colony and its indigenous allies in the French and Indian War, part of the Seven Years' War global conflict. Concluding the war, the peace treaty between the European powers, known as the Treaty of Paris 1763, assigned almost all of France's possessions in North America to Britain, including parts that would later become Ontario not already part of Rupert's Land. Britain established the first Province of Quebec, encompassing contemporary Quebec and southern Ontario. After the American War of Independence, the first reserves for First Nations were established. These are situated at Six Nations (1784), Tyendinaga (1793) and Akwesasne (1795). Six Nations and Tyendinaga were established by the British for those indigenous groups who had fought on the side of the British, and were expelled from the new United States. Akwesasne was a pre-existing Mohawk community and its borders were formalized under the 1795 Jay Treaty. In 1788, while part of the Province of Quebec, southern Ontario was divided into four districts: Hesse, Lunenburg, Mecklenburg, and Nassau. In 1792, the four districts were renamed: Hesse became the Western District, Lunenburg became the Eastern District, Mecklenburg became the Midland District, and Nassau became the Home District. Counties were created within the districts. By 1798, there were eight districts: Eastern, Home, Johnstown, London, Midland, Newcastle, Niagara, and Western. By 1826, there were eleven districts: Bathurst, Eastern, Gore, Home, Johnstown, London, Midland, Newcastle, Niagara, Ottawa, and Western. By 1838, there were twenty districts: Bathurst, Brock, Colbourne, Dalhousie, Eastern, Gore, Home, Huron, Johnstown, London, Midland, Newcastle, Niagara, Ottawa, Prince Edward, Simcoe, Talbot, Victoria, Wellington, and Western. In 1849, the districts of southern Ontario were abolished by the Province of Canada, and county governments took over certain municipal responsibilities. The Province of Canada also began creating districts in sparsely populated Northern Ontario with the establishment of Algoma District and Nipissing District in 1858. Evolution of the borders of Ontario since Canadian Confederation in 1867 The borders of Ontario, its new name in 1867, were provisionally expanded north and west. When the Province of Canada was formed, its borders were not entirely clear, and Ontario claimed eventually to reach all the way to the Rocky Mountains and Arctic Ocean. With Canada's acquisition of Rupert's Land, Ontario was interested in clearly defining its borders, especially since some of the new areas in which it was interested were rapidly growing. After the federal government asked Ontario to pay for construction in the new disputed area, the province asked for an elaboration on its limits, and its boundary was moved north to the 51st parallel north.[50] The northern and western boundaries of Ontario were in dispute after Canadian Confederation. Ontario's right to Northwestern Ontario was determined by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in 1884 and confirmed by the Canada (Ontario Boundary) Act, 1889 of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. By 1899, there were seven northern districts: Algoma, Manitoulin, Muskoka, Nipissing, Parry Sound, Rainy River, and Thunder Bay. Four more northern districts were created between 1907 and 1912: Cochrane, Kenora, Sudbury and Timiskaming.[51] Demographics[edit] Main article: Demographics of Ontario Population density of Ontario Historical populationsYearPop.±%1851952,004—    18611,396,091+46.6%18711,620,851+16.1%18811,926,922+18.9%18912,114,321+9.7%19012,182,947+3.2%19112,527,292+15.8%19212,933,662+16.1%19313,431,683+17.0%19413,787,655+10.4%19514,597,542+21.4%19565,404,933+17.6%19616,236,092+15.4%19666,960,870+11.6%19717,703,105+10.7%19768,264,465+7.3%19818,625,107+4.4%19869,101,695+5.5%199110,084,885+10.8%199610,753,573+6.6%200111,410,046+6.1%200612,160,282+6.6%201112,851,821+5.7%201613,448,494+4.6%Source: Statistics Canada In the 2016 census, Ontario had a population of 13,448,494 living in 5,169,174 of its 5,598,391 total dwellings, a 4.6 percent change from its 2011 population of 12,851,821. With a land area of 908,607.67 km2 (350,815.38 sq mi), it had a population density of 14.8/km2 (38.3/sq mi) in 2016.[52] The largest population centres in Ontario are Toronto, Ottawa, Hamilton, Kitchener, London and Oshawa which all have more than 300,000 inhabitants. The percentages given below add to more than 100 per cent because of dual responses (e.g., ""French and Canadian"" response generates an entry both in the category ""French Canadian"" and in the category ""Canadian""). The majority of Ontarians are of English or other European descent including large Scottish, Irish and Italian communities. Slightly less than 5 per cent of the population of Ontario is Franco-Ontarian, that is those whose native tongue is French, although those with French ancestry account for 11 per cent of the population. In relation to natural increase or inter-provincial migration, immigration is a huge population growth force in Ontario, as it has been over the last two centuries. More recent sources of immigrants with large or growing communities in Ontario include South Asians, Caribbeans, Latin Americans, Europeans, Asians, and Africans. Most populations have settled in the larger urban centres. In 2011, 25.9 per cent of the population consisted of visible minorities and 2.4 per cent of the population was Indigenous, mostly of First Nations and Métis descent. There was also a small number of Inuit people in the province. The number of Aboriginal people and visible minorities has been increasing at a faster rate than the general population of Ontario.[53] Religion[edit] In 2011, the largest religious denominations in Ontario were the Roman Catholic Church (with 31.4% of the population), the United Church of Canada (7.5%), and the Anglican Church (6.1%). 23.1% of Ontarians had no religious affiliation, making it the second-largest religious grouping in the province after Roman Catholics.[54] The major religious groups in Ontario in 2011 were: Religion People % Total 12,651,795 100 Catholic 3,976,610 31.4 No religious affiliation 2,927,790 23.1 Protestant 2,668,665 21.1 Other Christians 1,224,300 9.7 Muslim 581,950 4.6 Hindu 366,720 2.9 Christian Orthodox 297,710 2.4 Jewish 195,540 1.5 Sikh 179,765 1.4 Buddhist 163,750 1.3 Other religions 68,985 0.5 In Ontario, Catholics are represented by the Assembly of Catholic Bishops of Ontario[55] and the Anglican Protestants by the Ecclesiastical Province of Ontario.[56] The Ecclesiastical Province covers most of the geographical province of Ontario[56] Language[edit] See also: Franco-Ontarian English and French displayed on a gantry sign. Communities with sizeable Francophone populations are able to receive provincial services in French. The principal language of Ontario is English, the province's de facto official language,[57] with approximately 97.2 per cent of Ontarians having proficiency in the language, although only 69.5 per cent of Ontarians reported English as their mother tongue in the 2016 Census.[58] English is one of two official languages of Canada, with the other being French. English and French are the official languages of the courts in Ontario. Approximately 4.6 per cent of the population were identified as francophones,[59][note 1] with 11.5 per cent of Ontarians having proficiency in French.[58] Approximately 11.2 per cent of Ontarians reported being bilingual in both official languages of Canada.[58] Approximately 2.5 per cent of Ontarians have no proficiency in either English or French.[58] Franco-Ontarians are concentrated in the northeastern, eastern, and extreme Southern parts of the province, where under the French Language Services Act,[60] provincial government services are required to be available in French if at least 10 per cent of a designated area's population report French as their native language or if an urban centre has at least 5,000 francophones. Other languages spoken by residents include Arabic, Bengali, Cantonese, Dutch, German, Greek, Gujarati, Hindi, Hebrew, Italian, Korean, Malayalam, Mandarin, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Punjabi, Russian, Sinhalese, Somali, Spanish, Tagalog, Telugu, Tamil, Tibetan, Ukrainian, Urdu, and Vietnamese.[61] Economy[edit] Main article: Economy of Ontario Ontario is Canada's leading manufacturing province, accounting for 52% of the total national manufacturing shipments in 2004.[62] Ontario's largest trading partner is the American state of Michigan. As of April 2012[update], Moody's bond-rating agency rated Ontario debt at AA2/stable,[63] while S&P rated it AA-.[64] Dominion Bond Rating Service rated it AA(low) in January 2013.[65] Long known as a bastion of Canadian manufacturing and financial solvency, Ontario's public debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to be 38.4% in fiscal year 2023–2024.[66] Container ship at Algoma Steel. The Great Lakes provide ocean access for industries in the province's interior. Mining and the forest products industry, notably pulp and paper, are vital to the economy of Northern Ontario. As of 2011, roughly 200,000 ha are clearcut each year; herbicides for hardwood suppression are applied to a third of the total.[67] There has been controversy over the Ring of Fire mineral deposit, and whether the province can afford to spend CAD$2.25 billion on a road from the Trans-Canada Highway near Kenora to the deposit, currently valued at CAD$60 billion.[68] An abundance of natural resources, excellent transportation links to the North American heartland and the inland Great Lakes making ocean access possible via container ships, have all contributed to making manufacturing the principal industry of the province, found mainly in the Golden Horseshoe region, which is the largest industrialized area in Canada, the southern end of the region being part of the North American Rust Belt. Important products include motor vehicles, iron, steel, food, electrical appliances, machinery, chemicals, and paper. Hamilton is the largest steel manufacturing city in Canada followed closely by Sault Ste. Marie, and Sarnia is the centre for petrochemical production. Construction employed more than 6.5% of the province's work force in June 2011.[69] Ontario's steel industry was once centred in Hamilton. Hamilton harbour, which can be seen from the QEW Skyway bridge, is an industrial wasteland; U.S. Steel-owned Stelco announced in the autumn of 2013 that it would close in 2014, with the loss of 875 jobs. The move flummoxed a union representative, who seemed puzzled why a plant with capacity of 2 million tons per annum would be shut while Canada imported 8 million tons of steel the previous year.[70] Algoma Steel maintains a plant in Sault Ste Marie. A worker at the Oakville Assembly installs a battery in an automobile. The automotive industry is a contributor to the economy of Ontario. Ontario surpassed Michigan in car production, assembling 2.696 million vehicles in 2004. Ontario has Chrysler plants in Windsor and Bramalea, two GM plants in Oshawa and one in Ingersoll, a Honda assembly plant in Alliston, Ford plants in Oakville and St. Thomas and Toyota assembly plants in Cambridge and Woodstock. However, as a result of steeply declining sales, in 2005, General Motors announced massive layoffs at production facilities across North America, including two large GM plants in Oshawa and a drive train facility in St. Catharines, that resulted in 8,000 job losses in Ontario alone. In 2006, Ford Motor Company announced between 25,000 and 30,000 layoffs phased until 2012; Ontario was spared the worst, but job losses were announced for the St Thomas facility and the Windsor Casting plant. However, these losses will be offset by Ford's recent announcement of a hybrid vehicle facility slated to begin production in 2007 at its Oakville plant and GM's re-introduction of the Camaro which will be produced in Oshawa. On December 4, 2008, Toyota announced the grand opening of the RAV4 plant in Woodstock,[71] and Honda also plans to add an engine plant at its facility in Alliston. Despite these new plants coming online, Ontario has not yet fully recovered following massive layoffs caused by the global recession; its unemployment rate was 7.3% in May 2013,[72] compared to 8.7 percent in January 2010[73] and approximately 6% in 2007. In September 2013, the Ontario government committed CAD$70.9 million to the Ford plant in Oakville, while the federal government committed CAD$71.1mn, to secure 2,800 jobs.[74] The province has lost 300,000 manufacturing jobs in the decade from 2003, and the Bank of Canada noted that ""while the energy and mining industries have benefitted from these movements, the pressure on the manufacturing sector has intensified, since many firms in this sector were already dealing with growing competition from low-cost economies such as China.""[75][76] Toronto's Financial District serves as the centre for Canada's financial services. Toronto, the capital of Ontario, is the centre of Canada's financial services and banking industry. Neighbouring cities are home to product distribution, IT centres, and manufacturing industries. Canada's Federal Government is the largest single employer in the National Capital Region, which centres on the border cities of Ontario's Ottawa and Quebec's Gatineau.[77][78] The information technology sector is important, particularly in the Silicon Valley North section of Ottawa, home to Canada's largest technology park.[79] IT is also important in the Waterloo Region, where the headquarters of BlackBerry is located.[80] Tourism contributes heavily to the economy of Central Ontario, peaking during the summer months owing to the abundance of fresh water recreation and wilderness found there in reasonable proximity to the major urban centres. At other times of the year, hunting, skiing and snowmobiling are popular. This region has some of the most vibrant fall colour displays anywhere on the continent, and tours directed at overseas visitors are organized to see them. Tourism also plays a key role in border cities with large casinos, among them Windsor, Cornwall, Sarnia and Niagara Falls, the latter of which attracts millions of US and other international visitors.[81] Agriculture[edit] Aerial view of farms in Waterloo. A significant portion of the land in Southern Ontario is used as farmland. Once the dominant industry, agriculture now uses a small percentage of the workforce. However, much of the land in southern Ontario is given over to agriculture. As the following table shows, while the number of individual farms has steadily decreased and their overall size has shrunk at a lower rate, greater mechanization has supported increased supply to satisfy the ever-increasing demands of a growing population base; this has also meant a gradual increase in the total amount of land used for growing crops. Ontario Farming 1986 1991 1996 2001 2006 Number of Farms 72,713 68,633 67,520 59,728 57,211 Total Hectares 5,646,582 5,451,379 5,616,860 5,466,233 5,386,453 Acres 13,953,009 13,470,652 13,879,565 13,507,358 13,310,217 Planted Crops Hectares 3,457,966 3,411,667 3,544,927 3,656,705 3,660,941 Acres 8,544,821 8,430,438 8,759,707 9,035,916 9,046,383 Source: Statistics Canada, Census of Agriculture.[82] vte Grapevines growing in Prince Edward County, a wine-growing region Common types of farms reported in the 2001 census include those for cattle, small grains and dairy. The fruit- and wine industry is primarily on the Niagara Peninsula, Prince Edward County, and along the northern shore of Lake Erie, where tobacco farms are also situated. Market vegetables grow in the rich soils of the Holland Marsh near Newmarket. The area near Windsor is also very fertile. The Heinz plant in Leamington was taken over in these autumn of 2013 by Warren Buffett and a Brazilian partner, following which it put 740 people out of work.[83] Government subsidies followed shortly; Premier Kathleen Wynne offered CAD$200,000 to cushion the blow, and promised that another processed-food operator would soon be found.[84] On December 10, 2013, Kellogg's announced layoffs for more than 509 workers at a cereal manufacture plant in London.[85] The area defined as the Corn Belt covers much of the southwestern area of the province, extending as far north as close to Goderich, but corn and soy are grown throughout the southern portion of the province. Apple orchards are a common sight along the southern shore of Nottawasaga Bay (part of Georgian Bay) near Collingwood and along the northern shore of Lake Ontario near Cobourg. Tobacco production, centred in Norfolk County, has decreased, allowing an increase in alternative crops such as hazelnuts and ginseng. The Ontario origins of Massey Ferguson, once one of the largest farm-implement manufacturers in the world, indicate the importance agriculture once[citation needed] had to the Canadian economy. A sign marking the Ottawa Greenbelt, an initiative to protect farmland and limit urban sprawl Southern Ontario's limited supply of agricultural land is going out of production at an increasing rate. Urban sprawl and farmland severances contribute to the loss of thousands of acres of productive agricultural land in Ontario each year. Over 2,000 farms and 150,000 acres (61,000 ha) of farmland in the GTA alone were lost to production in the two decades between 1976 and 1996. This loss represented approximately 18%"". of Ontario's Class 1 farmland being converted to urban purposes. In addition, increasing rural severances provide ever-greater interference with agricultural production.[86] In an effort to protect the farmland and green spaces of the National Capital Region, and Greater Toronto Area, the Federal[87] and Provincial Governments introduced greenbelts around Ottawa[88] and the Golden Horseshoe, limiting urban development in these areas.[89] Energy[edit] See also: Energy policy of Canada, Renewable energy in Canada, and Smart grid Ontario's rivers make it rich in hydroelectric energy.[90] In 2009, Ontario Power Generation generated 70 percent of the province's electricity, of which 51 percent is nuclear, 39% is hydroelectric and 10% is fossil-fuel derived.[91] By 2025, nuclear power is projected to supply 42%, while fossil-fuel-derived generation is projected to decrease slightly over the next 20 years.[92] Much of the newer power generation coming online in the last few years is natural gas or combined-cycle natural gas plants. OPG is not, however, responsible for the transmission of power, which is under the control of Hydro One. The Pickering Nuclear Generating Station is one of three nuclear power stations in Ontario. Despite its diverse range of power options, problems related to increasing consumption, lack of energy efficiency and aging nuclear reactors, Ontario has been forced in recent years to purchase power from its neighbours Quebec and Michigan to supplement its power needs during peak consumption periods. Ontario's basic domestic rate in 2010 was 11.17 cents per kWh; by contrast. Quebec's was 6.81.[93] In December 2013, the government projected a 42 percent hike by 2018, and 68 percent by 2033.[92] Industrial rates are projected to rise by 33% by 2018, and 55% in 2033.[92] The Green Energy and Green Economy Act, 2009 (GEA), takes a two-pronged approach to commercializing renewable energy; first, it aims to bring more renewable energy sources to the province; and secondly, it aims to adopt more energy-efficiency measures to help conserve energy. The bill envisaged appointing a Renewable Energy Facilitator to provide ""one-window"" assistance and support to project developers to facilitate project approvals.[94] The approvals process for transmission projects would also be streamlined and (for the first time in Ontario) the bill would enact standards for renewable energy projects. Homeowners would have access to incentives to develop small-scale renewables such as low- or no-interest loans to finance the capital cost of renewable energy generating facilities like solar panels.[94] The Sir Adam Beck Hydroelectric Generating Stations are hydroelectric plants located in Niagara Falls. Ontario is home to Niagara Falls, which supplies a large amount of electricity to the province. The Bruce Nuclear Generating Station, the largest operational nuclear power plant in the world, is also in Ontario and uses 8 CANDU reactors to generate electricity for the province. Ontario had the most wind energy capacity of the country with 4,900 MW of power (41% of Canada's capacity).[95] Government, law and politics[edit] Further information: Monarchy in Ontario, Executive Council of Ontario, and Local government in Ontario The British North America Act 1867 section 69 stipulated ""There shall be a Legislature for Ontario consisting of the Lieutenant Governor and of One House, styled the Legislative Assembly of Ontario."" The assembly currently has 124 seats (increased from 107 as of the 42nd Ontario general election) representing ridings elected in a first-past-the-post system across the province. The legislative buildings at Queen's Park are the seat of government. Following the Westminster system, the leader of the party holding the most seats in the assembly is known as the ""Premier and President of the Council"" (Executive Council Act R.S.O. 1990). The Premier chooses the cabinet or Executive Council whose members are deemed ministers of the Crown. Although the Legislative Assembly Act (R.S.O. 1990) refers to ""members of the assembly"", the legislators are now commonly called MPPs (Members of the Provincial Parliament) in English and députés de l'Assemblée législative in French, but they have also been called MLAs (Members of the Legislative Assembly), and both are acceptable. The title of Prime Minister of Ontario, correct in French (le Premier ministre), is permissible in English but now generally avoided in favour of the title ""Premier"" to avoid confusion with the Prime Minister of Canada. Law[edit] Osgoode Hall houses the Court of Appeal for Ontario, the appellate court for the province. Ontario has grown, from its roots in Upper Canada, into a modern jurisdiction. The old titles of the chief law officers, the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General, remain in use. They both are responsible to the Legislature. The Attorney-General drafts the laws and is responsible for criminal prosecutions and the administration of justice, while the Solicitor-General is responsible for law enforcement and the police services of the province. The Municipal Act, 2001 (Ontario)[96] is the main statute governing the creation, administration and government of municipalities in the Canadian province of Ontario, other than the City of Toronto. After being passed in 2001, it came into force on January 1, 2003, replacing the previous Municipal Act.[97] Effective January 1, 2007, the Municipal Act, 2001 (the Act) was significantly amended by the Municipal Statute Law Amendment Act, 2006 (Bill 130).[98][99] Politics[edit] Main article: Politics of Ontario The Ontario Legislative Building at Queen's Park. The building serves as the meeting place for the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. Ontario has numerous political parties which run for election. The four main parties are the centre-right Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario, the social democratic Ontario New Democratic Party (NDP), the centre to centre-left Ontario Liberal Party, and Green Party of Ontario. The Progressive Conservatives, Liberals and New Democrats have each governed the province, while the Greens elected their first member to the Legislative Assembly in 2018. The 2018 provincial election resulted in a Progressive Conservative majority government under party leader Doug Ford, who was sworn in as Premier on June 29. Ontario NDP leader Andrea Horwath was sworn in as the leader of her Majesty's Loyal Opposition. Administrative divisions[edit] Map of the counties, regional municipalities, districts, and municipalities of Ontario. Ontario has three types of first-level administrative divisions. They include single-tier municipalities, upper-tier municipalities (which may be in the form of either regional municipalities or counties), and districts. Upper-tier municipalities and districts are made up of smaller municipalities and other types of administrative divisions. Administrative divisions differ primarily in the services that they provide to their residents, with the differing structures of these administrative regions resulting in disparities among Ontario's different regions. The administrative regions of Ontario are roughly coterminous with the census divisions used by Statistics Canada, although some exceptions do exist.[note 2] Urban areas[edit] See also: Golden Horseshoe, National Capital Region (Canada), and Detroit–Windsor Statistics Canada's measure of a ""metro area"", the Census Metropolitan Area (CMA), roughly bundles together population figures from the core municipality with those from ""commuter"" municipalities.[100] CMA (largest other included municipalities in brackets) 2001 2006 2011 2016 % Change Toronto CMA (Mississauga, Brampton) 4,682,897 5,113,149 5,583,064 5,928,040 6.2 Ottawa CMA (Gatineau, Clarence-Rockland) 1,067,800 1,130,761 1,254,919 1,323,783 4.4 Hamilton CMA (Burlington, Grimsby) 662,401 692,911 721,053 747,545 3.7 Kitchener CMA (Cambridge, Waterloo) 414,284 451,235 496,383 523,894 5.5 London CMA (St. Thomas, Strathroy-Caradoc) 435,600 457,720 474,786 494,069 4.1 St. Catharines CMA (Niagara Falls, Welland) 377,009 390,317 392,184 406,074 3.5 Oshawa CMA (Whitby, Clarington) 296,298 330,594 356,177 379,848 6.6 Windsor CMA (Lakeshore, LaSalle) 307,877 323,342 319,246 329,144 3.1 Barrie CMA (Innisfil, Springwater) 148,480 177,061 187,013 197,059 5.4 Sudbury CMA (Whitefish Lake, Wanapitei Reserve) 155,601 158,258 160,770 164,689 1.0 Kingston CMA 146,838 152,358 159,561 161,175 1.0 *Parts of Quebec (including Gatineau) are included in the Ottawa CMA.

Publicly funded elementary and secondary schools are administered by the Ontario Ministry of Education, while colleges and universities are administered by the Ontario Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities. The Minister of Education is Stephen Lecce, the Minister of Colleges and Universities is Ross Romano, and the Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development Monte McNaughton. Higher education[edit] Main article: Higher education in Ontario See also: List of colleges in Ontario and List of universities in Ontario Higher education in Ontario includes postsecondary education and skills training regulated by the Ministry of Training, Colleges, and Universities and provided by universities, colleges of applied arts and technology, and private career colleges.[102] The minister is Merrilee Fullerton. The ministry administers laws covering 22 public universities,[103] 24 public colleges (21 Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology (CAATs) and three Institutes of Technology and Advanced Learning (ITALs)),[104] 17 privately funded religious universities,[105] and over 500 private career colleges.[106] The Canadian constitution provides each province with the responsibility for higher education and there is no corresponding national federal ministry of higher education.[107] Within Canadian federalism the division of responsibilities and taxing powers between the Ontario and Canadian governments creates the need for co-operation to fund and deliver higher education to students. Each higher education system aims to improve participation, access, and mobility for students. There are two central organizations that assist with the process of applying to Ontario universities and colleges: the Ontario Universities' Application Centre and Ontario College Application Service. While application services are centralized, admission and selection processes vary and are the purview of each institution. Admission to many Ontario postsecondary institutions can be highly competitive. Upon admission, students may get involved with regional student representation with the Canadian Federation of Students, the Canadian Alliance of Student Associations, the Ontario Undergraduate Student Alliance, or through the College Student Alliance in Ontario. Culture[edit] This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (January 2021) In 2019, the government of Ontario passed legislation that established the Poet Laureate of Ontario.[108] Songs and slogans[edit] An Ontario licence plate with the slogan Yours to Discover at the bottom of the plate In 1973, the first slogan to appear on licence plates in Ontario was ""Keep It Beautiful"". This was replaced by ""Yours to Discover"" in 1982,[109] apparently inspired by a tourism slogan, ""Discover Ontario"", dating back to 1927.[110] Plates with the French equivalent, Tant à découvrir, were made available to the public beginning in May 2008.[111] (From 1988 to 1990,[112] ""Ontario Incredible""[113] gave ""Yours to Discover"" a brief respite.) A Place to Stand, a Place to Grow is a song commissioned by the government of Ontario for its pavilion in Expo 67, and an unofficial anthem of the province.[114] As a part of the Canada 150 celebrations in 2017, the provincial government unveiled an ""updated,"" rendition of the song.[114] In 2007, the provincial tourism agency commissioned a new song, ""There's No Place Like This"" is featured in television advertising, performed by Ontario artists including Molly Johnson, Brian Byrne, Keshia Chanté,[115] as well as Tomi Swick and Arkells. Professional sports[edit] The province has professional sports teams in baseball, basketball, Canadian football, ice hockey, lacrosse, rugby league, rugby union and soccer.

Ontario has two major east–west routes, both starting from Montreal in the neighbouring province of Quebec. The northerly route, which was a major fur trade route, travels west from Montreal along the Ottawa River, then continues northwestward towards Manitoba. Major cities on or near the route include Ottawa, North Bay, Sudbury, Sault Ste. Marie, and Thunder Bay. The southerly route, which was driven by growth in settlements originated by the United Empire Loyalists and later other European immigrants, travels southwest from Montreal along the St. Lawrence River, Lake Ontario, and Lake Erie before entering the United States in Michigan. Major cities on or near the route include Kingston, Belleville, Peterborough, Oshawa, Toronto, Mississauga, Kitchener-Waterloo, Hamilton, London, Sarnia, and Windsor. This route was also heavily used by immigrants to the Midwestern US particularly in the late 19th century. Air travel[edit] Thunder Bay International Airport is one of five international airports operating in Ontario. Important airports in the province include Toronto Pearson International Airport, which is the busiest airport in Canada,[116] handling nearly 50 million passengers in 2018.[117] Ottawa Macdonald–Cartier International Airport is Ontario's second largest airport. Toronto/Pearson and Ottawa/Macdonald-Cartier form two of the three points in Canada's busiest set of air routes (the third point being Montréal–Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport). In addition to airports in Ottawa, and Toronto, the province also operates three other international airports, the John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport in Hamilton, the Thunder Bay International Airport in Thunder Bay and the London International Airport in London. John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport serves as cargo hub, reliever for Pearson, and a hub for ULCC Swoop. Most Ontario cities have regional airports, many of which have scheduled commuter flights from Air Canada Jazz or smaller airlines and charter companies – flights from the mid-size cities such as Thunder Bay, Sault Ste. Marie, Sudbury, North Bay, Timmins, Windsor, London, and Kingston feed directly into larger airports in Toronto and Ottawa. Bearskin Airlines also runs flights along the northerly east–west route, connecting Ottawa, North Bay, Sudbury, Sault Ste. Marie, Kitchener and Thunder Bay directly. Isolated towns and settlements in the northern areas of the province rely partly or entirely on air service for travel, goods, and even ambulance services (MEDIVAC), since much of the far northern area of the province cannot be reached by road or rail. Railways[edit] Via Rail operates the inter-regional passenger train service on the Quebec City–Windsor Corridor, along with The Canadian, a transcontinental rail service from Southern Ontario to Vancouver, and the Sudbury–White River train. Additionally, Amtrak rail connects Ontario with key New York cities including Buffalo, Albany, and New York City. Ontario Northland provides rail service to destinations as far north as Moosonee near James Bay, connecting them with the south. Freight rail is dominated by the founding cross-country Canadian National Railway and CP Rail companies, which during the 1990s sold many short rail lines from their vast network to private companies operating mostly in the south. Regional commuter rail is limited to the provincially owned GO Transit, and serves a train-bus network spanning the Golden Horseshoe region, with Union Station in Toronto serving as the transport hub.[118][119] There are several city rail-transit systems in the Province. The Toronto Transit Commission operates subways, as well as streetcars (being one of the busiest streetcar systems in North America). OC Transpo operates a light rail metro system in Ottawa.[120] In addition, Waterloo region operates a surface light rail system.[121] Plans to build a light rail line is also underway in the Regional Municipality of Peel.[122][123] Ontario Northland freight train crossing the Missinaibi River at Mattice-Val Côté in Northern Ontario Roads[edit] Main article: Roads in Ontario Highway 400 in Seguin. The roadway forms a part of the province's 400-series highways. 400-series highways make up the primary vehicular network in the south of province, and they connect at a number of points to border crossings to the United States, and Quebec, the busiest being the Detroit–Windsor Tunnel and Ambassador Bridge and the Blue Water Bridge (via Highway 402). Some of the primary highways along the southern route are Highway 401, Highway 417, and Highway 400,[124][125] Highway 401 being the busiest highway in North America. Other provincial highways and regional roads inter-connect the remainder of the province. Waterways[edit] See also: Boat building industry in Ontario The Saint Lawrence Seaway, which extends across most of the southern portion of the province and connects to the Atlantic Ocean, is the primary water transportation route for cargo, particularly iron ore and grain. In the past, the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River were also a major passenger transportation route, but over the past half century passenger travel has been reduced to ferry services and sightseeing cruises. Ontario's three largest ports are the Port of Hamilton, Port of Thunder Bay and the Port of Windsor. Ontario's only saltwater port is located in the town of Moosonee on James Bay.

There would otherwise be 51 census divisions instead of the 49 official ones used by Statistics Canada.

Academic Departments: Anthropology, Classical Studies, Drama and Speech Communication, Economics, English Language and Literature, Fine Arts, French Studies, Germanic and Slavic Studies, History, Independent Studies, Philosophy, Political Science, Psychology, Religious Studies, Social Development Studies, Sociology, Spanish and Latin American Studies. The Faculty of Arts offers seven undergraduate entry programs, over thirty majors and more than 400 degree options. The University of Waterloo, along with University of Guelph and Wilfrid Laurier University is a member of the Tri-University Graduate History Program, which combines the history departments of the three universities at the graduate level. Graduate students are registered at one of the three universities according to their supervisor, but can take courses at any of the campuses. This allows the group to have more diverse course offerings more efficiently. Research[edit] Research centres[edit] The Faculty of Arts is home to seventeen research centres, including: The Centre for Accounting Research and Education (CARE), Canadian Centre of Arts and Technology (CCAT), The Canadian Language & Literacy Research Network, The UW Centre for Child Studies, The Canadian Centre for Cultural Innovation (CCCI), The Centre for Cultural Management (CCM), The Early Childhood Education Centre (ECEC), The Centre for Election Studies, The Centre for Advanced Studies in Finance, The Centre on Foreign Policy and Federalism (CFPF), The Centre for Learning and Teaching Through Technology (LT3), The Southwestern Ontario Research Data Centre (SWORDC), The Survey Research Centre (SRC), Synaesthesia Research Centre, The UW Centre for Mental Health Research The Waterloo Centre for German Studies (WCGS), Waterloo Decision Research (WDR). Endowed chairs[edit] In 2007, the Department of German and Slavic Studies was granted funding for a ""Right Honourable John G. Diefenbaker Memorial Chair in German Literary Studies.""[1] Since 2009, the Department of Philosophy has hosted the ""Wolfe Chair in Science and Technology Studies"" as well as the ""Waterloo Chair in Science and Society.""[2] The Department of Philosophy also provides an endowed visiting professorship, the ""Humphrey Professorship in Feminist Philosophy"".[3] The Department of Jewish studies is home to the ""Joe and Wolfe Lebovic Chair in Jewish Studies"".[4] Student societies[edit] Students in the Faculty of Arts are represented by the Arts Student Union (ASU) which has many roles including hosting social events, management of a student tuck shop, and representing student interests on various boards within and outside of the Faculty. Additionally, all students pay into the Arts Endowment Fund which funds improvements to equipment and supplies for students.[5] Within ASU there are 27 societies representing programs in the Faculty.[6] References[edit] ^ The History of the Right Honourable John G.

Uppsala University Hospital is owned and operated by the Uppsala County Council in cooperation with the university and serves, together with Enköping hospital in Enköping, as the primary hospitals for Uppsala County. It also fills the function of a tertiary referral hospital for the Uppsala/Örebro health care region and, for certain specialities, a tertiary referral hospital for the entire country of Sweden.

Academ[ien]s sjukhus"", also known as the Nosocomium Academicum (in the Oxenstierna Palace), is seen to the right in this 1769 engraving by F. Akrelius. To the left the old chapter house, later used by the university and renamed Academia Carolina. The old main building of the Uppsala University Hospital, photograph from c. 1920. This building, although modernized, is still in use. Gustavianum in Uppsala, showing the cupola housing Rudbeck's anatomical theatre from 1663 The university hospital has its origins in two older hospitals: one was founded in 1302 and is older than the university, the other one was founded for the Faculty of Medicine in 1708. These were merged in 1850. The earliest hospital in Uppsala was founded in 1302. This was used for 400 years until the great fire of 1702, which destroyed large parts of central Uppsala. A new hospital, which later became the Uppsala county hospital, was built in its place, but was moved out of the town in 1811. The university hospital as such was founded in 1708 as the first clinic with the specific intention of facilitating the practical education of medical students. Known as the Nosocomium Academicum, it was located in the Oxenstierna Palace at Riddartorget, beside the cathedral (see illustration). The building (the former residence of the President of the Royal Chancellery Bengt Gabrielsson Oxenstierna) today houses the Uppsala University Faculty of Law. The present Akademiska sjukhuset was established in 1850 as an organizational merger of the county hospital and the university clinic, and a new building was inaugurated in 1867 on the hill below Uppsala Castle to the southeast. From this building, which is still in use, the present hospital complex has grown. In 1663 medical professor and amateur architect Olaus Rudbeck designed the anatomical theatre located in the Gustavianum, which at the time served as the main building of Uppsala University. Rudbeck had spent some time at Leiden University, and both the anatomical theatre and the Uppsala University Botanical Garden he founded in Uppsala in 1655 were influenced by his experiences. Today Gustavianum is still in use for lectures and conferences, and also hosts a museum, Museum Gustavianum, open to visitors. Facilities[edit] As of 2017[update], the hospital has around 8,300 employees and 940 beds.[1] In addition, the hospital also has: several business entities, including: an ATM cafeterias, kiosks, restaurants and shops a pharmacy (Apoteket) a 40-bed hotel for patients and relatives a chaplaincy (staffed by the Church of Sweden) a hospital library which serves as a public library Organization[edit] The present hospital director is Lennart Persson, and the medical directors are Margareta Öhrvall, M.D. and Bengt Sandén, M.D.[2][3] Divisions[edit] The following are divisions under the hospital director:[4] Diagnostics, Anesthesia and Technology Division Emergency and Rehabilitation Division Oncology, Thorax and Medical Division Neurology Division Psychiatry Division Surgery Division Women's Health and Pediatrics Division Departments[edit] Specialities[3] Anaesthesiology and Main Operating Theatres Antenatal Centre Audiology Burn Unit Cardiology Clinical Physiology Centre for Gynecology and Obstetrics Centre for Laboratory Medicine Uppsala University Children's Hospital Clinical genetics International Child Health Care Pediatric Medicine Paediatric Oncology Pediatric Orthopaedics Pediatric Surgery Clinical Chemistry Clinical Microbiology Clinical Pathology Clinical Pharmacology Dermatology and Venereology Endocrinology and Diabetes Care Emergency Department Endocrine oncology ENT (Ear, Nose, Throat) General Internal Medicine Geriatrics Gastroenterology Haematology Hepatology Hospital Physics Immunology and Transfusion Medicine Infectious Diseases Lung Medicine National Centre for Battered and Raped Women Nephrology Neurology Neurophysiology Neurosurgery Occupational and Environmental Medicine Occupational Therapy Oncology Ophthalmology Orthopaedics Phoniatrics Physiotherapy Psychiatry Adult Psychiatry Geriatric Psychiatry Pediatric and Adolescent Psychiatry Radiology Rehabilitation Reproduction Centre Rheumatology Social Medicine Surgery Otosurgery Plastic Surgery Thoracic Anaesthesiology Thoracic Surgery Transplantation Surgery Toxicomania Urology Specialized Centres[3] Centre for Clinical Medical Research Centre for Eating Disorders Centre for Cystic Fibrosis Centre for Down's Syndrome Uppsala Centre of Excellence in Neuroendocrine Tumors National Centre for Battered and Raped Women Pain Centre Trauma Centre Wound Centre Svedberg Laboratory[edit] The Svedberg Laboratory is a university facility that contains the Gustaf Werner cyclotron,[5] which is used for research as well as for proton therapy for the treatment of cancer with close cooperation with the oncology clinic at Uppsala University Hospital.[6] Such an accelerator and its gantries costs between $60 million and $100 million,[7] and makes Uppsala University Hospital one of the approximately 40 centers in the word to provide such cancer treatment. Uppsala University Children's Hospital[edit] Uppsala University Children's Hospital (Swedish: Akademiska barnsjukhuset) was formed in 1991 with the merger of the departments of paediatrics, paediatric surgery, paediatric orthopaedic surgery and clinical genetics. The children's hospital also has a Paediatric Oncology department with 14 beds and a rehabilitation centre called the Folke Bernadotte Home with 20 beds.[8] Uppsala Centre of Excellence in Neuroendocrine Tumors[edit] Since the 1970s, there has been a special emphasis on endocrine tumors at Uppsala University Hospital. The department of Endocrine oncology[9] has been seeing and treating about 3000 patients with endocrine tumors, making it the largest of the six centers of excellence recognized by the European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society (ENETS).[10] Mobile Intensive Care Units[edit] Helicopter Borne Intensive Care Unit[edit] Uppsala University Hospital also has a helicopter borne intensive care unit. The current equipment is a Eurocopter Dauphin N3 equipped as a one-bed intensive care unit (2010). The helicopter is crewed by two IFR licensed pilots, with medical personnel consisting of a doctor and a nurse both specializing in intensive care and anesthesia. Crew members in other specialities are brought along, as needed by the mission. The helicopter is mainly used for transports between hospitals in Sweden and Finland but also serves the Uppsala County area with helicopter emergency medical care within a range of 100 km from the hospital.[11] Fixed Wing Intensive Care Unit[edit] In addition to the short range mobile intensive care provided by the helicopter, Uppsala University Hospital owns a Bombardier Learjet 45. The aircraft is equipped by LifePort and capable of providing long range intensive care transports of up to two patients on stretchers or in incubators. The plane is crewed by two pilots and medical personnel in appropriate specialities for the mission.[12] Education[edit] Uppsala University Hospital provides a major part of the medical education (organized by the Uppsala University Faculty of Medicine) and nurse training in Uppsala. Uppsala Care[edit] Uppsala University Hospital also offers its services to foreign citizens (non-swedes) under the service organization called ""Uppsala Care"".[13] Specialities which are offered to foreigners include:[14] Endocrine oncology Clinic for Internal Medicine, diabetes and other endocrine disorders, haematology, hepatology Gynecological endocrinology and infertility Immune deficiency diseases Neuro Centre, neurology, neurophysiology Neurosurgery, occupational therapy, rehabilitation Prosthesis Rehabilitation of spinal cord injuries Surgical treatment and radio therapy for cancer Thoracic Centre, invasive cardiology including angioplasty and arrhythmia ablation, thoracic and lung surgery Transplantation (bone marrow, liver, kidney, pancreas) Urology diseases References[edit] ^ ""Årsredovisning och korta fakta"". www.akademiska.se (in Swedish).

Founded in 1477, it is the oldest university in Sweden and the Nordic countries still in operation.[4] The university motto is ""Gratiae veritas naturae"". The university rose to significance during the rise of Sweden as a great power at the end of the 16th century and was then given a relative financial stability with a large donation from King Gustavus Adolphus in the early 17th century. Uppsala also has an important historical place in Swedish national culture, identity and for the Swedish establishment: in historiography, literature, politics, and music. Many aspects of Swedish academic culture in general, such as the white student cap, originated in Uppsala. It shares some peculiarities, such as the student nation system, with Lund University and the University of Helsinki. Uppsala belongs to the Coimbra Group of European universities and to the Guild of European Research-Intensive Universities.[5] It has ranked among the world's 100 best universities in several international rankings.[6][7][8] The university has nine faculties distributed over three disciplinary domains: Humanities and Social Sciences, Medicine and Pharmacy, and Science and Technology. As of 2020, it had approximately 52,000 registered students at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels, and 2,200 PhD students.[2] Architecturally, Uppsala University has traditionally had a strong presence in Fjärdingen, the neighbourhood around the cathedral on the western side of the River Fyris. Despite some contemporary building developments further away from the centre, Uppsala's historic centre continues to be dominated by the presence of the university.[9] Contents 1 History 1.1 15th century: origins 1.2 16th century: Turbulent times 1.3 17th century: Expansion 1.4 18th century: Enlightenment and mercantilism 1.5 Women at the university 2 Administration and organisation 2.1 Central administration 2.2 Faculties 2.3 Faculty of Law 2.4 University Library 2.5 Uppsala University Hospital 2.6 The Svedberg Laboratory 3 Campus 3.1 Ekonomikum 4 Student life 4.1 Nations and student union 4.2 Music 4.3 Housing crisis 4.4 Housing 5 Athletics 5.1 The exercitiae 5.2 Other sports 6 Rankings 7 Notable people 8 International cooperation 9 In fiction and popular culture 10 See also 11 References 12 Further reading 13 External links History[edit] This section does not cite any sources.

(October 2012) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) 15th century: origins[edit] As with most medieval universities, Uppsala University initially grew out of an ecclesiastical center. The archbishopric of Uppsala had been one of the most important sees in Sweden proper since Christianity first spread to this region in the ninth century. Uppsala had also long been a hub for regional trade, and had contained settlements dating back into the deep Middle Ages. As was also the case with most medieval universities, Uppsala had initially been chartered through a papal bull. Uppsala's bull, which granted the university its corporate rights, was issued by Pope Sixtus IV in 1477, and established a number of provisions. Among the most important of these was that the university was officially given the same freedoms and privileges as the University of Bologna. This included the right to establish the four traditional faculties of theology, law (Canon Law and Roman law), medicine, and philosophy, and to award the bachelor's, master's, licentiate, and doctoral degrees. The archbishop of Uppsala was also named as the university's Chancellor, and was charged with maintaining the rights and privileges of the university and its members.[9] 16th century: Turbulent times[edit] Gustavianum, built 1622–1625 and now a museum. The turbulent period of the reformation of King Gustavus Vasa resulted in a drop in the already relatively insignificant number of students in Uppsala, which was seen as a center of Catholicism and of potential disloyalty to the Crown. Swedish students generally travelled to one of the Protestant universities in Germany, especially Wittenberg. There is some evidence of academic studies in Uppsala during the 16th century; the Faculty of Theology is mentioned in a document from 1526, King Eric XIV appointed Laurentius Petri Gothus (later archbishop) rector of the university in 1566, and his successor and brother John III appointed a number of professors in the period 1569–1574. At the end of the century the situation had changed, and Uppsala became a bastion of Lutheranism, which Duke Charles, the third of the sons of Gustavus Vasa to eventually become king (as Charles IX) used to consolidate his power and eventually oust his nephew Sigismund from the throne. The Meeting of Uppsala in 1593 established Lutheran orthodoxy in Sweden, and Charles and the Council of state gave new privileges to the university on 1 August of the same year. Theology still had precedence, but in the privileges of 1593, the importance of a university to educate secular servants of the state was also emphasized. Three of the seven professorial chairs which were established were in Theology; of the other four, three were in Astronomy, Physics (or general natural sciences) and Latin eloquence. A fourth chair was given to Ericus Jacobi Skinnerus, who was also appointed rector, but whose discipline was not mentioned in the charter. Of the professors, several were taken over from the Collegium Regium in Stockholm, which had been functioning for a few years but closed in 1593. An eighth chair, in Medicine, was established in 1595 but received no appointee for several years. In 1599 the number of students was approximately 150. In 1600 the first post-reformation conferment of degrees took place. In the same year, the antiquarian and mystic Johannes Bureus designed and engraved the seal of the university, which is today used as part of the logotype. 17th century: Expansion[edit] The medieval university had mainly been a school for theology. The aspirations of the emergent new great power of Sweden demanded a different kind of learning. Sweden both grew through conquests and went through a complete overhaul of its administrative structure. It required a much larger class of civil servants and educators than before. Preparatory schools, gymnasiums, were also founded during this period in various cathedral towns, notably Västerås (the first one) in 1623. Beside Uppsala, new universities were founded in more distant parts of the Swedish Realm, the University of Dorpat (present-day Tartu) in Estonia (1632) and the University of Åbo in Finland (1640). After the Scanian provinces were taken from Denmark, Lund University was founded in 1666. Instrumental in the reforms of the early 17th-century Swedish state was the long-dominant Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna, who had spent his own student days in German universities and who for the last years before his death was also chancellor of the university. King Gustavus Adolphus showed the university a keen interest and increased the professorial chairs from eight to thirteen in 1620, and again to seventeen in 1621. In 1624 the king donated ""for all eternity"" all his own inherited personal property in the provinces of Uppland and Västmanland, some 300 farms, mills and other sources of income. The king's former private tutor, Johan Skytte, who was made chancellor of the university in 1622, donated the Skyttean chair in Eloquence and Government which still exists. The university received a stable structure with its constitution of 1626. The head of the university was to be the chancellor, his deputy was the ""pro-chancellor"" (always the archbishop ex officio). The immediate rule was the responsibility of the consistory, to which belonged all the professors of the university, and the rector magnificus, who was elected for a semester at the time; the latter position circulated among the professors, each of whom sometimes held it several times. During the late 16th and early 17th centuries (and perhaps even earlier), the university was located to the old chapter house parallel to the south side of the cathedral, later renamed the Academia Carolina. In 1622–1625 a new university building was built east of the cathedral, the so-called Gustavianum, named after the reigning king. In the 1630s, the total number of students were about one thousand. Anders Celsius, astronomer and physicist. Queen Christina was generous to the university, gave scholarships to Swedish students to study abroad and recruited foreign scholars to Uppsala chairs, among them several from the University of Strassburg, notably the philologist Johannes Schefferus (professor skytteanus), whose little library and museum building at S:t Eriks torg now belongs to the Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala. The Queen, who would eventually declare her abdication in the great hall of Uppsala Castle, visited the university on many occasions; in 1652 she was present at an anatomical demonstration arranged at the castle for the young physician Olaus Rudbeck. Rudbeck, one of several sons of Johannes Rudbeckius, a former Uppsala professor who became Bishop of Västerås, was sent for a year to the progressive University of Leiden in the Netherlands. Returning in 1654, he received an assistantship in Medicine in 1655, and had already gone to work on a program of improving aspects of the university. He planted the first botanical garden, the one which would eventually be tended by Carl Linnaeus and is kept today as a museum of 18th-century botany under the name Linnéträdgården (""the Linnaean Garden""). With the patronage of the university chancellor Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie, Rudbeck was made full professor in 1660, was elected rector for two terms, despite his youth, and started a revision of the work of the other professors and a building spree with himself as architect. His most significant remaining architectural work is the anatomical theatre, which was added to Gustavianum in the 1660s and crowned with the characteristic cupola for which the building is today known. A gifted scientist, architect and engineer, Rudbeck was the dominant personality of the university in the late 17th century who laid some of the groundwork for Linnaeus and others, but he is perhaps more known today for the pseudohistorical speculations of his Atlantica, which consumed much of his later life. When large parts of Uppsala burned down in 1702, Gustavianum, which contained the university library and its many valuable manuscripts, escaped the fire; local lore has it that the aging Rudbeck stood on the roof directing the work of fighting the fire. 18th century: Enlightenment and mercantilism[edit] The early part of the 18th century was still characterized by the combination of Lutheran orthodoxy and classical philology of the previous century, but eventually a larger emphasis on sciences and practically useful knowledge developed. The innovative mathematician and physicist Samuel Klingenstierna (1698–1765) was made a professor in 1728, the physicist and astronomer Anders Celsius in 1729, and Carl Linnaeus was made professor of Medicine with Botany in 1741. The university was not immune to the parliamentary struggle between the parties known as the ""Hats"" and the ""Caps,"" with the former having a preference for hard sciences and practical knowledge. The Hat government then in power established a chair in economics (Œconomia publica) in 1741 and called Anders Berch as its first incumbent. This was the first professorship in economics outside Germany, and possibly the third in Europe (the first chairs having been established in Halle and Frankfurt (Oder) in 1727). In 1759, following a donation, another chair in economy was established, the Borgströmian professorship in ""practical economy,"" by which was meant the practical application of the natural sciences for economic purposes (it eventually developed into a chair for physiological botany). There were very radical attempts at reforms which were never implemented, but important changes took place. University studies had until this time been very informal in their overall organization, with the all-purpose philosophiæ magister-degree being the only one frequently conferred and many never graduating, as there were no degree applicable to their intended area of work (and well-connected aristocratic students often not graduating as they did not need to). A few professional degrees for various purposes were introduced in 1749–1750, but the radical suggestion of binding students to a single program of study adapted to a particular profession was never implemented. The reforms of this era have been compared to those of the 1960s and 1970s (Sten Lindroth). Although it took some time after the fire of 1702, Uppsala Cathedral and Uppsala Castle were both eventually restored, both by Carl Hårleman, perhaps the most important Swedish architect of the era. He also modified Gustavianum, designed a new conservatory for Linnaeus' botanical garden and built the new Consistory house, which was to be the administrative core of the university. Another magnificent royal donation was that of the large baroque garden of the castle, given by Gustavus III to the university when it was obvious that the old botanical garden was insufficient. A large new conservatory was built by the architect Louis Jean Desprez. Additional grounds adjacent to the baroque garden has since been added. The old garden of Rudbeck and Linnaeus was largely left to decay, but was reconstructed in the years between 1918 and 1923 according to the specifications of Linnaeus in his work Hortus Upsaliensis from 1745. King Gustav III of Sweden visits the university in 1786 Women at the university[edit] The issue of women's right to study at universities was raised during the very last session of the estate parliament in 1865 in a motion from Carl Johan Svensén, a member of the farmers' estate. The reception was mixed, with the most negative views coming from the clergy. In the following years the issue continued to be debated at the universities. In 1870, it was decided to let women take the secondary school examination (""studentexamen"") that gave the right to entry at universities and the right to study and complete degrees at the faculties of Medicine in Uppsala and Lund and at the Caroline Institute of Medicine and Surgery in Stockholm. A common view was that the female sensitivity and compassion would make women capable of working as physicians, but their right to work was still restricted to private practice. Women's rights to higher education was extended in 1873, when all degrees except those in the faculties of theology and the licentiate degree in Law were made accessible for women. The first female student in Sweden was Betty Pettersson (1838–1885), who had already worked as a private tutor for several years when she took ""studentexamen"" in 1871. With a royal dispensation, she was allowed to enter university in Uppsala in 1872, the year before studies at the Philosophical faculty would actually be made generally available to women. She studied modern European languages and was the first woman in Sweden to complete an academic degree when she finished a fil. kand. in 1875. She became the first woman to be employed as a teacher in a public school for boys. The first woman in Sweden to complete a doctoral degree was Ellen Fries (1855–1900), who entered Uppsala university in 1877 and became a PhD in history in 1883. Other female students of this period includes Lydia Wahlström (1869–1954) who later became a noted educator, activist and writer on women's emancipation and suffrage. Defending a dissertation in history in 1900, she became the second woman to finish a doctorate at a Swedish university. In 1892, she founded the Uppsala Women's Student Association, who set up spex performances and other things enjoyed by male students but from which the women were excluded at the time. The members of the Association were the first woman to wear the student caps in public, an important sign of their status. Elsa Eschelsson (1861–1911) was the first Swedish woman to finish a law degree, and the first to become a ""docent,"" but was not permitted to even hold the position of acting professor despite being formally qualified for this in everything but her sex. After years of conflicts with the professor of civil law A. O. Winroth, who wrote the paper on ""Om tjenstehjonsförhållandet"" and with the university board, she died in 1911 from an overdose of sleeping-powder. According to the constitution of 1809, only ""native Swedish men"" could be appointed to higher civil servant positions, including professorships. This was changed in 1925, and the first woman to hold a professorial chair at Uppsala University was Gerd Enequist, appointed professor of human geography in 1949. Hildegard Björck who studied in the university became the first Swedish woman to receive an academic degree. Administration and organisation[edit] Central administration[edit] The governing board of the university is the consistory, with representatives of the faculties as well as members representing the students and non-academic employees (three professors and three students), and ten university outsiders appointed by the Swedish government. All these members in the consistory have the right to vote. The unions active at the university also have three representatives in the consistory; these members have the right to speak but not any right to vote. Since the last reorganization in 1999 the university has a separate body called the academic senate, which is a wider, but mostly advisory group representing teaching staff / researchers and students. The executive head of the university is the rector magnificus, whose deputy is the prorector. There are (also since 1999) three vice rectors, each heading one of the three ""disciplinary domains"" (Arts and Social Sciences, Medicine and Pharmacy, and Science and Technology) into which the nine faculties are divided. Each faculty has a faculty board and is headed by a dean (dekanus). The position of dean is held part-time by a professor of the faculty. Faculties[edit] Through division of faculties and the addition of a previously independent school of Pharmacy as a new faculty, the traditional four-faculty organization of European universities has evolved into the present nine faculties: The disciplinary domain of Arts and Social Sciences includes the Faculty of Arts, the Faculty of Social Sciences, the Faculty of Languages, the Faculty of Theology, the Faculty of Law and the Faculty of Educational Sciences (formerly the Department of Education, that was raised to the status of a faculty in its own right in 2002). The disciplinary domain of Medicine and Pharmacy includes the Faculty of Medicine and the Faculty of Pharmacy. The Faculty of Pharmacy was originally an independent ""royal institute"" in Stockholm, which was moved to Uppsala and incorporated with the university between 1968 and 1972. The disciplinary domain of Science and Technology includes only the Faculty of Science and Technology. The engineering programs have from 1982 been marketed as the Uppsala School of Engineering (Uppsala Tekniska Högskola). This has however never been a separate institution, but only a unit within the Faculty of Science and Technology and use of the term has been phased out after the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences was renamed the Faculty of Sciences and Technology in the 1990s. Uppsala University also hosts the Forum for South Asia Studies, a collaborative academic effort by its six faculties: Theology, Law, History and Philosophy, Social Sciences, Languages, and Educational Sciences. The Forum aims facilitate and promote research and education related to the South Asian countries: India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh, the Maldives and Afghanistan, on the national and international level, with Ferdinando Sardella, Faculty of Theology, serving as the Forum's director.[10] Faculty of Law[edit] The Faculty of Law (Juridiska fakulteten) is the oldest one in the Nordic countries and existed before 1477 (when the University of Uppsala was founded). The activities of the faculty include a wide range of research areas and specializations. This Faculty has one department: the Department of Law.[11] University Library[edit] Main article: Uppsala University Library The university library holds about 5.25 million volumes of books and periodicals (131,293 shelf meters), 61,959 manuscripts, 7,133 music prints, and 345,734 maps and other graphic documents. The holdings of the collection of manuscripts and music includes, among other things, the Gothic Bible manuscript Codex Argenteus. The Carolina Rediviva, the main building of the university library, designed by Carl Fredrik Sundvall and completed in 1841. The most widely recognized building of the university library is Carolina Rediviva, the ""revived Carolina,"" thus named in reference to Academia Carolina (see illustration), which held the university library from the earliest times until 1691, when it was moved to the upper floor of Gustavianum, where it miraculously survived the great city fire of 1702. In the mid-18th century, there were plans to move it back to the Academia Carolina or a new building on the same spot. The building was demolished in 1778 to make place for a new library, but this was never built and the area next to the cathedral where it stood is today a lawn. The present Carolina Rediviva was built in a different place and completed in 1841. The present university library system comprises 19 branches, including the one in the Carolina building. Uppsala University Hospital[edit] Main article: Uppsala University Hospital The Uppsala Academic Hospital or Akademiska sjukhuset, which functions as a teaching hospital for the Faculty of Medicine and the Nursing School, is run by the Uppsala County Council in cooperation with the university. As of 2003[update], the hospital had 7,719 employees and as of 2004[update] 1,079 places for patients. The university hospital is actually older than the university, as it goes back to the earliest hospital, founded in Uppsala in 1302, much later merged with the university clinic. This was used for 400 years until the great fire of 1702 which destroyed large parts of central Uppsala. A new hospital, which later became the Uppsala county hospital, was built in its place, but was moved out of the town in 1811. The old main building of the Uppsala University Hospital, photograph from c. 1920 The first clinic with the specific intention to facilitate the practical education of medical students was the Nosocomium Academicum, founded in 1708 and located to the Oxenstierna Palace at Riddartorget beside the cathedral (see illustration above). The building (the former residence of the President of the Royal Chancellery Bengt Gabrielsson Oxenstierna) today houses the Faculty of Law. The present Akademiska sjukhuset was founded in 1850 as an organizational merger of the county hospital and the university clinic, and a new building was inaugurated in 1867 on the hill below Uppsala Castle to the southeast. From this building, which is still in use, the present hospital complex has grown. The Svedberg Laboratory[edit] The Svedberg Laboratory (named after Theodore The Svedberg) is a university facility that contains the Gustaf Werner cyclotron,[12] which is used for research as well as for proton therapy for the treatment of cancer with close cooperation with the oncology clinic at Uppsala University Hospital.[13] Such an accelerator and its gantries costs between $60 million and $100 million,[14] and makes Uppsala University Hospital one of the approximately 40 centers in the world to provide such cancer treatment. Campus[edit] The buildings and locations where the university has activities or which are significantly connected to its history are listed below. Some of the historic buildings in central Uppsala have had to be retired, as their protected status has made it impossible to make modifications necessary to meet requirements to adjust to the needs for students with disabilities.

Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (August 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Ekonomikum is a building that is part of Uppsala University. The building, designed by Swedish modernist architect Peter Celsing, was completed in 1976, and housed departments for languages, humanities, and social sciences. Since the early 2000s, Ekonomikum is a multidisciplinary centre specialized in economics and financial studies, information science, and human geography. It has approximately 2,500 students and 500 faculty and staff members, a library, KPH print shop, a restaurant, and several students' associations. Student life[edit] Nations and student union[edit] Gästrike-Hälsinge nation Up until June 2010 students at Uppsala University were obliged to become members of one of the nations, corporations of students traditionally according to province of origin (not strictly upheld now, for practical reasons). The system of dividing students into nations according to origin can ultimately be traced back to the nations at the medieval University of Paris and other early medieval universities, but the Uppsala nations appear only about 1630–1640, most likely under influence of the Landsmannschaften which existed at some of the German universities visited by Swedish students. In Sweden, nations exist only in Uppsala and Lund. The nations were originally seen as subversive organisations promoting less virtuous aspects of student life, but in 1663 the consistory made membership in a nation legal, each nation being placed under the inspectorship of a professor. The current thirteen nations all have a history stretching back to the early-to-mid 17th century, but some of them are the result of mergers of older, smaller nations that took place in the early 19th century to facilitate the financing of building projects. The nations at Uppsala University are: Stockholms nation Uplands nation Gästrike-Hälsinge nation Östgöta nation Västgöta nation Södermanlands-Nerikes nation Västmanlands-Dala nation Smålands nation Göteborgs nation Kalmar nation Värmlands nation Norrlands nation Gotlands nation Since the 1960s there is a fourteenth nation, the Skånelandens nation (referring to the Scanian lands) which has no membership fee and exists as a legal device to get around the compulsory membership for students who prefer not to become affiliated with the traditional nations. However this nation was made redundant in 2010, when membership in a nation ceased to be mandatory. The Uppsala Student Union was founded in 1849 as a corporation representing all students except those attending the faculty of Pharmacy, irrespective of nation. The students at the faculty of Pharmacy were also exempt from the compulsory membership in the nations, but most pharmacy-students belonged to one. However they were obliged to take up membership in the Pharmaceutical Association of Uppsala Students, an organisation having the same role as the nations and the student union at the rest of the university. The compulsory membership in a student union was abolished 1 July 2010; however, the unions will still be the representing organisations in the university boards and committees. The status as a student union will be decided upon by the university board for periods of three years at a time. On February 20, 2013 the university board decided that there will be four student unions at the university during July 2013 – June 2016: the Uppsala Student Union (for students at the faculties of Art, Social Sciences, Languages, Theology, Law, Educational Sciences and Medicine), the Pharmaceutical Association of Uppsala Students (for students at the Faculty of Pharmacy), the Uppsala Union of Engineering and Science Students (at the Faculty of Science and Technology), and Rindi (the union for students at Campus Gotland).[15] In February, 2016, two additional associations were given the status as student unions: Uppsala Business & Economics Students Association (for students of economy) and Uppsala Law Student Associations (for students of law).[16] Thus, there are now six student unions at Uppsala university.[17] Music[edit] Student singers marching down the staircase in Carolina Rediviva, on the occasion of the 400th anniversary of the university in 1877. The ""staircase march"" (trappmarschen) when the singers led the audience in a march out of the hall where the concert was held, is an annual tradition that was later moved to the new main university building completed in 1887. (The monumental staircase of Carolina was later sacrificed to create more storage space for books.) The University's Royal Academic Orchestra was founded in 1627. Its main purpose is to play at academic ceremonies, but holds concerts on other occasions as well. Its leader has the title of director musices. The position has been held by composers such as Wilhelm Stenhammar, Hugo Alfvén and Lars-Erik Larsson. Affiliated with the University are three choirs, the mixed Uppsala University Choir (Allmänna Sången), founded in 1830, the male choir Orphei Drängar, founded in 1853, and the Academy Chamber Choir of Uppsala, founded in 1957. A number of other choirs and orchestras are affiliated with the nations. An important name in the recent history of the choirs is Eric Ericson, who was conductor of both Orphei Drängar and the Chamber Choir. In honour of Ericson, the FöreningsSparbanken endowed the Eric Ericson Chair in Choral Directing, and the Uppsala University Choral Centre was inaugurated in 2000. The centre arranges courses in choral directing.Uppsala universitets Körcentrum Housing crisis[edit] Like many cities there is a shortage of housing in Uppsala, a problem which has existed for many years. Both native Swedes and foreign students are finding it difficult to find accommodation when first enrolling into the university.[18][19] This problem is however not as bad as it was with several major housing construction projects having been completed after 2010.[citation needed] There has never been a custom in Sweden for the universities to arrange housing for students, in fact universities are not allowed by law to own housing. Students are expected to arrange their own living accommodations on the private market. To make it easier for students to find moderately priced housing, special student rooms and student apartments have been built by the student nations and student unions. However, the student housing is insufficient to accommodate all students. About 40,000 students are eligible to live in the 11,000 available rooms and apartments.[20] Because of the low rent in these apartments and the general lack of housing in Uppsala the student apartments are highly attractive and many try to hold on to the contracts as long as possible even after graduating.[21] Housing[edit] One of the most popular housing accommodations for the students are Flogsta, Kantorsgatan, Studentstaden, Studentvägen, Klostergatan, Rackarbergsgatan and many more. Flogsta is one of the biggest and most popular housing choice for international students. Athletics[edit] Sports play a very small role in the life of the university, compared to British and especially U.S. universities, but have existed in various forms since the early 17th century. Uppsala University is more noted for its musical and choral traditions. Both have partial roots in the 17th century institution of extracurricular exercises for students from the nobility. The exercitiae[edit] The Exercise Yard in c. 1770; contemporary engraving To ease the recruitment of students from the nobility, the university started in the 1630s to offer training in a number of exercitiae or ""exercises"" (Swedish: exercitier) deemed necessary for the well-rounded education of a young nobleman: riding, fencing, dance, drawing and modern languages such as French and Italian. The initiative came from Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna, who saw the value in a well-educated class of civil servants and the danger to his own class if its members would fall behind in academic education compared to those students who came from the lower estates. An ""exercise yard,"" built for the riding and fencing exercises, was demolished in the late 19th century to give place to the new University Hall. The modern languages were made part of the regular academic curriculum in the 19th century. The surviving ""exercises"" include: Fencing – Arranged in collaboration with Upsala Fäktning, a private fencing club.[22] Fencing master as of 2005 is Igor Tsikinjov, captain of the Swedish Fencing Federation Gymnastics and sports – Located to the Art Nouveau University Gymnastics Hall, colloquially known as Svettis (from the Swedish word for sweat) Riding – Arranged by the equestrian department of the University, which has its own stables. Leaders of the activities are the Academy Stable Master and the Inspector Equitandi Music – Leader of the musical activities is the director musices, who is the conductor of the Royal Academic Orchestra; the current Director Musices is Professor Stefan Karpe Drawing – The university appoints an established artist as Drawing Master; free weekly croquis and other lessons are offered in the southern tower of Uppsala Castle Other sports[edit] Besides the exercitiae, other sports have had a presence in Uppsala student life. The Upsala Simsällskap, ""Uppsala Swimming Society,"" which is the oldest swimming club in the world, was founded in 1796 by the mathematician Jöns Svanberg. It had no formal connection to the university, but all its earliest members came from academic life. Svanberg even arranged a mock graduation ceremony, a simpromotion, in parody of the university ceremonies, where those who had graduated from its swimming training were awarded ""degrees"" of master (magister) and bachelor (kandidat). These degrees stuck, and Swedish swimming schools still use these degrees for different levels of swimming skills. An attempt was made in the 1870s to introduce academic rowing after the Oxbridge model. The Stockholm Nation acquired a rowing boat in 1877, soon followed by the Gothenburg Nation, and for a number of years rowing competitions were held between teams from the two nations. Although rowing never got the strong position it has at the English universities, an annual Uppsala-Lund regatta has been arranged since 1992, between rowing teams from Uppsala and Lund University. The race is held on the Fyris River in Uppsala on even years, and on a river in the vicinity of Lund on odd years. Each year there is at least one full eight crew with cox competing, with both men's and women's teams present. With the recent victory for Uppsala in 2005, the score stands 24–23 in Uppsala's favor.

[32] Notable people[edit] Main article: List of Uppsala University People Botanist, physician and zoologist Carl Linnaeus Niklas Zennström, co-founder of KaZaA and Skype Uppsala University is associated with 8 Nobel Prize laureates,[33] and numerous royalty, academics and public figures. As the dominant academic institution in Sweden for several centuries, Uppsala University has educated a large proportion of Swedish politicians and civil servants ever since its first period of expansion in the early part of the 17th century. These range from Chancellor of the Realm (rikskansler) Johan Oxenstierna (1611–1657) and Lord Chief Justice (riksdrots) Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie (1622–1686) to the first Social Democratic Prime Minister of Sweden, Hjalmar Branting (1860–1925). Other alumni are Dag Hammarskjöld (1905–1961), United Nations Secretary General who was (posthumously) awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1961, and the Swedish diplomat Hans Blix (born 1928), who was Head of the International Atomic Energy Agency 1981–1997, of the UNMOVIC 2000–2003, and previously Swedish Minister of Foreign Affairs 1978–1979. Hammarskjöld and Blix both graduated from the Uppsala Faculty of Law, as did the Swedish Minister of Foreign Affairs Anna Lindh, who was assassinated in 2003. Most Swedish clergymen, including most bishops and archbishops, have been educated at the university, including, in more recent times, Nathan Söderblom (1866–1931), Professor of the History of Religions in the Faculty of Theology, later Archbishop of Uppsala, and awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1930 for his work as leader of the ecumenical movement. The university became prominent in the sciences in the 18th century with names such as the physician and botanist Carl Linnaeus (1707–1778), the father of biological and mineralogical taxonomy, and his numerous important pupils, the physicist and astronomer Anders Celsius (1701–1744), inventor of the Celsius scale the predecessor of the Celsius scale, and the chemist Torbern Bergman (1735–1784). Another scientist from this era is Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772), better remembered today as a religious mystic. Several of the elements were discovered by Uppsala scientists during this period or later. Jöns Jakob Berzelius, one of the fathers of modern chemistry, received his doctorate in medicine in Uppsala in 1804, but later moved to Stockholm. Uppsala scientists of the 19th century include the physicist Anders Jonas Ångström (1814–1874). During the 20th century several Nobel laureates in the sciences have been Uppsala alumni or professors at the university. Many well-known Swedish writers have studied in Uppsala: Georg Stiernhielm (1598–1672) is often called the father of Swedish poetry. The poet and song composer Carl Michael Bellman (1740–1795), without doubt the best-loved and best-remembered of Swedish 18th-century poets, matriculated but left the university after less than a year. The writer, historian and composer Erik Gustaf Geijer (1783–1847), professor of history, and the poet Per Daniel Amadeus Atterbom (1790–1855), professor of poetry, were principal figures of early 19th-century Swedish romanticism. The less than happy experiences of the Uppsala student life of novelist and playwright August Strindberg (1849–1912), resulted in his Från Fjärdingen och Svartbäcken (1877), a collection of short stories set in Uppsala (""From Fjärdingen and Svartbäcken,"" the title refers to two districts in Uppsala). Other Uppsala alumni are the poet Erik Axel Karlfeldt (1864–1931), who refused the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1918, but received it posthumously in 1931, the novelist and playwright Pär Lagerkvist (1891–1974), Nobel laureate in 1951, and the poet and novelist Karin Boye (1900–1941), for whom one branch of the university library has been named. The Communist leader Ture Nerman (1886–1969) wrote a novel called Olympen, based on his experience as a student in Uppsala. International cooperation[edit] Uppsala University has signed student exchange agreements with about 400 universities across all parts of the world.[34] It takes part in the Erasmus programme and the Nordplus programme. It also benefits from its membership of the Coimbra Group of universities. In May 2010 Uppsala joined the Matariki Network of Universities (MNU) together with Dartmouth College (USA), Durham University (UK), Queen's University (Canada), University of Otago (New Zealand), University of Tübingen (Germany), and University of Western Australia (Australia).[35] In fiction and popular culture[edit] Along with Lund, Uppsala is the historic and traditional centre of Swedish academic life, making it a popular object of reference in Swedish literature, art, and film. Specifically, Uppsala University has appeared notably in Män som hatar kvinnor or The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larsson. The Norwegian pop singer Kirsti Sparboe dedicated one of her biggest successes to Uppsala University, publishing in 1969 the song ""Ein Student aus Uppsala"".[36] The song, originally written in German, lasted 14 weeks in the German charts. Uppsala University appears as a research centre in the strategy game Empire: Total War. Uppsala University appears in the novel S. by Doug Dorst and J. J. Abrams. The fictional author V. M. Straka of Ship of Theseus sends Mr. Grahn a confidential letter on Uppsala Universitet letterhead and stamps his signature with ""Straka Uppsala Arkiv"" (included as an insert to the book).

The environmental and human rights organisation Urgewald stands for all of this. What others say about Urgewald Urgewald starts exactly where the problems arise: in the boardrooms of politics and business. With this “lever” a comparatively small organization can achieve great things. It is a pleasure for me to support you. Sabine Haupt, Supporting Member How Urgewald works You can’t build a nuclear power plant, a dam or a pipeline without loans, insurances and other investments. Mining companies and arms manufacturers are also always in need of fresh money. Urgewald uncovers the financing of environmental destruction and abuse of human rights, and names those responsible. “Follow the Money” is the strategic approach to our campaigns against investors and other financiers.

These expansion projects alone would use up three-quarters of the total remaining carbon budget if we are to have a 66% probability of limiting global warming to 1.5° Celsius. The report exposes the banks and investors that are providing financing to the fossil fuel companies developing large-scale, contested coal, oil and gas expansion projects.

Tom Sanzillo, Director of Finance, IEEFA institute Huge Campaign Success Norway to Divest €5 Billion from Coal Giants like Glencore and RWE On June 12, 2019, the Norwegian Parliament has voted in favor of the government’s proposal to tighten the coal exclusion criteria of Norway’s Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG), Europe’s largest sovereign wealth fund. The decision followed a longstanding campaign by Urgewald an Norwegian partners. According to research by Urgewald and Framtiden i våre hender (FIVH), this affects 8 coal companies that will be divested. The NGOs estimate the volume of the new divestment action to total €5.1 billion. The Pension Fund has now adopted 2 of the 3 coal exclusion criteria Urgewald put forward in 2015. Read Our Press Release World Bank Undermines Paris Climate Treaty! The World Bank has repeatedly and fully pointed out that it will adopt the Paris goals and contribute to reducing greenhouse gases. But, the analyses of Urgewald's Senior Adviser Heike Mainhardt shows a different picture: In the last five financial years, World Bank financing for fossil energies has been more than twice as high (12 billion US dollars) as for renewable energies (5 billion US dollars, excluding large hydropower). Read more How We Expose Climate's Worst Enemies & Change the Finance Industry We all know the coal industry is the number one driver of climate change, damages peoples’ health and destroys the environment. But do we really know which companies belong to the industry? And more importantly, do banks and investors know? From our portfolio analyses and in-depth discussions with many major banks and insurers, we have reached the conclusion that financial institutions systematically underestimate their holdings in the coal industry. To address this blind spot, we have developed a unique divestment tool: The Global Coal Exit List (GCEL). See Our Research, Graphics & Reports How We Work for Better Multilateral Development Banks The purpose of international development banks is to eliminate or reduce poverty, while protecting the environment. However, this is precisely where they often fail. What is wrong with them? How can NGOs like Urgewald change the way they are allocating their funds? A look behind the scenes of development finance, disastrous projects and the fight of NGOs for stronger standards.

In past years, the scope of our financial research was limited to around 200 coal plant developers. Our new research, however, analyzes financial flows to all 934 companies on the Global Coal Exit List (GCEL)[1],” says Katrin Ganswindt, head of financial research at Urgewald. Top Institutional Investors in the Coal Industry In January 2021, 4,488 institutional investors held investments totaling US$ 1.03 trillion in companies operating along the thermal coal value chain. Among the investors covered by the NGOs’ research are pension funds, mutual funds, asset managers, insurance companies, hedge funds, commercial banks, sovereign wealth funds and other types of institutional investors. The world’s largest institutional investor in the coal industry is the US mutual fund company Vanguard with holdings of almost US$ 86 billion. It is closely followed by BlackRock, which holds investments of over US$ 84 billion in the coal industry. Together, these two investment giants account for 17% of institutional investments in the global coal industry. Based on their size, BlackRock and Vanguard’s coal investments are in a class of their own, but they are also representative of a much bigger problem. US investors are the single largest provider of institutional investment to companies on the Global Coal Exit List. With shares and bonds in value of US$ 602 billion, US investors collectively account for 58% of institutional investments in the global coal industry. “While many large EU investors have begun screening coal companies out of their portfolios, the vast majority of US investors have refused to adopt coal exit policies. Our research underscores how dire the consequences of this failure are,” says Katrin Ganswindt. “We welcome President Biden’s Executive Order to end public financing for fossil fuels abroad, but the new administration must also address the role of Wall Street as a huge driver of climate pollution around the world. Its massive investments in the coal industry are driving us ever deeper into a climate crisis,” comments Paddy McCully, Climate and Energy Program Director at Rainforest Action Network. With holdings of US$ 81 billion, investors from Japan account for the second highest share of institutional investments in the coal industry. Japan’s Government Pension Investment Fund alone holds bonds and shares in value of US$ 29 billion in companies listed on the GCEL. The third largest group are UK investors, whose collective holdings in the coal industry amount to US$ 47 billion. “While the UK government recently announced that it will end public financing for overseas fossil fuel projects in 2021, most UK institutional investors have not even begun to expel coal from their portfolios. Unless they do their homework soon, the UK-hosted COP 26 will become a big embarrassment for these institutions,” states Katrin Ganswindt. The Biggest Lenders to the Coal Industry Urgewald’s research identified 381 commercial banks that provided loans totaling US$ 315 billion to the coal industry over the past 2 years.[2] The top 3 lenders are the Japanese banks Mizuho (US$ 22 billion), Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (US$ 21 billion) and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (US$ 18 billion). The 4th and 5th largest lenders to the coal industry are Citigroup (US$ 13.5 billion) and Barclays (US$ 13.4 billion). “The coal policies adopted by Japanese banks are among the weakest in the world. They only cover a small portion of banks’ lending and do not rule out corporate loans or underwriting for companies that are still building new coal plants in Japan, Vietnam, the Philippines and elsewhere. Japan’s banks must stop pouring fuel on the fire and finally adopt comprehensive coal exclusion policies,” says Eri Watanabe from 350.org Japan. A regional breakdown of lenders from different countries shows that Japanese banks collectively provided US $ 76 billion in loans to the coal industry between October 2018 and October 2020. Next in line are banks from the United States (US$ 68 billion) and banks from the UK (US$ 22 billion). Commercial banks from these three countries alone accounted for 52% of total lending to companies on the Global Coal Exit List over the past two years. The Biggest Underwriters of the Coal Industry Over the same time period, 427 commercial banks channeled over US$ 808 billion to companies on the Global Coal Exit List through underwriting.[3] The world’s top 10 underwriters are all Chinese financial institutions. The big 5 are in descending order, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (US$ 37 billion), the China International Trust and Investment Corporation (US$ 32 billion), the Shanghai Pudong Development Bank (US$ 28 billion), the Bank of China (US$ 24 billion) and the China Everbright Group (US$ 23.7 billion). While Chinese banks account for less than 6% of total lending to the coal industry, they account for 58% of underwriting. Through their underwriting, Chinese banks channeled US$ 467 billion to the coal industry over the past two years. Next in line are US banks (US$ 104 billion), Japanese banks (US$ 59 billion), Indian banks (US$ 36 billion) and UK banks (US$ 35 billion). Together, banks from these 5 countries account for 87% of total underwriting for the coal industry. The fundamental difference is that Chinese and Indian banks almost exclusively underwrite bond and share issues of coal companies from their respective countries, while US, Japanese and UK banks provide underwriting services to coal companies all over the world. Commercial Banks’ Support for the Coal Industry has Increased since Paris The NGOs’ research also examined the development of banks’ lending and underwriting for the coal industry since January 2016. While direct lending for coal companies spiked in 2017, subsequent years show a downward trend in lending volumes. Underwriting of coal industry shares and bonds, however, has grown steadily since 2016. The alarming result of this analysis is shown in the graph below: Commercial banks’ are channeling more money to the coal industry than in 2016, the year after the Paris Climate Agreement was signed. In 2016, banks provided US$ 491 billion through lending and underwriting to companies listed on the GCEL. By 2019, this amount had grown to US$ 543 billion, an increase of almost 11%. For 2020, the NGOs’ dataset only covers the period between January 1st and October 31st, but a comparison with the first 10 months of the preceding years indicates that commercial banks’ total support for the coal industry in 2020 was likely at least as high as in 2019. In spite of the COVID-19 pandemic, banks’ lending and underwriting for the coal industry amounted to US$ 456 billion in the first 10 months of 2020. This is US$ 3 billion more than were provided during the same reference period (US$ 453 billion between January 1st and October 31st) in 2019. “These numbers provide a sobering reality check on bank’s climate commitments,” says Yann Louvel, policy analyst for the NGO Reclaim Finance. Reclaim Finance maintains an online “Coal Policy Tool” that tracks and ranks all coal policies announced by financial institutions. According to its tool, 88 commercial banks have now adopted a coal policy, but out of this total only 4 banks have adopted “robust” coal exclusion policies. “The new financial data confirms the findings of our Coal Policy Tool: The vast majority of banks’ coal policies have so many loopholes that their impact is almost meaningless,” says Louvel. A case in point is Citigroup, which announced in April 2020 that it will phase out coal mining by 2030. “This policy has zero impact on Citigroup’s enormous support for coal power producers and coal plant developers. And if you read the small print, the phase-out only applies to companies that generate at least 25% of their revenues from thermal coal mining, thus letting large diversified coal miners slip out of the net. Sadly, this kind of evasion is par for the course,” explains Louvel. What needs to be done? Ending the era of coal means ending the era of coal finance and investment. But the time to accomplish this task is quickly running out. “Vague net zero announcements for 2050 - an entire generation into the future - are masking financial institutions’ refusal to take decisive action now. The bulk of coal financing and investment must be ended before 2030. This is the decade that counts,” says McCully. The NGOs’ research shows that the bulk of coal investment, lending and underwriting can be traced to financial actors in a dozen countries. “If we do not move financial actors in the US, Japan, China, the UK and other key countries to exit coal soon, they will propel us into a future where the Paris climate goals are no longer within reach,” warns Ganswindt. “What we need are comprehensive, immediate coal exit policies. Insurers such as AXA, banks like Crédit Mutuel, UniCredit and Desjardins or asset managers like Ostrum[4] have already shown what must be done by excluding most of the companies on the Global Coal Exit List from their portfolios. Now is the time for the finance industry to act. A speedy exit from coal finance and investment is not only do-able and desirable, it is a question of survival,” says Louvel. Rankings of the top “Dirty Thirty” investors, lenders and underwriters to the coal industry are listed in the annex of the PDF attached below.

Profundo used several financial databases including Bloomberg, Refinitiv Eikon and IJGlobal to compile the data for this project. These databases, however, only report syndicated loans, i.e. loans, which are provided by a group of banks to an individual company. These financial databases do not report bilateral loans, where a company borrows money from only one bank, rather than from a group of lenders. A significant portion of commercial banks’ lending, namely all bilateral loans to companies featured on the GCEL, is therefore not captured by our data. Our data also has limitations on the investor side as many pension funds and insurers do not report on their holdings. While shareholding data is generally more complete, our research probably captures less than 1/3 of the bonds institutional investors hold in coal companies. It is therefore likely that the numbers for commercial banks’ lending to the coal industry and institutional investors’ bond holdings in the coal industry are significantly higher than our research shows. Notes: [1] The GCEL is a comprehensive database of companies operating along the thermal coal value chain. It is produced annually by Urgewald and can be viewed at: www.coalexit.org [2] Between October 1st 2018 and October 31st 2020. [3| Underwriting or investment banking refers to the process by which banks raise investment capital for companies by issuing bonds or shares on their behalf and selling them to investors such as pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds etc. [4] Ostrum is the asset manager of the French bank Natixis Kontakt Jacey Bingler International Media Director & Fossil Free Finance Campaign Network Coordinator jacey [at] urgewald.org →  Unser Team Mehr zum Thema GCEL Finance Data 2020 Release with Annex Facebook Twitter Instagram YouTube E-Mail NGO-Source Newsletter bestellen Anmeldung Medienverteiler Fußbereichsmenü English Kontakt Termine FAQs Impressum Datenschutz AGB Spenden Jetzt Spenden Fördermitgliedschaft verschenken Spenden zu Anlässen urgewald-Stiftung Themen Übersicht Banken und Waffen Bankwechsel China Kohle-Divestment Weltbank & Co.

74,"Urban area - Wikipedia Urban area From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Human settlement with high population density and infrastructure of built environment ""Built up area"" redirects here. For the Highway Code, see Built-up area (Highway Code). ""Urban agglomeration"" redirects here. For city clusters, see Megalopolis. Greater Tokyo Area, Japan, the world's most populated urban area, with about 38 million inhabitants Greater Melbourne at night, seen from the International Space Station An urban area, or built-up area, is a human settlement with a high population density and infrastructure of built environment. Urban areas are created through urbanization and are categorized by urban morphology as cities, towns, conurbations or suburbs. In urbanism, the term contrasts to rural areas such as villages and hamlets; in urban sociology or urban anthropology it contrasts with natural environment. The creation of early predecessors of urban areas during the urban revolution led to the creation of human civilization with modern urban planning, which along with other human activities such as exploitation of natural resources led to a human impact on the environment. ""Agglomeration effects"" are in the list of the main consequences of increased rates of firm creation since. This is due to conditions created by a greater level of industrial activity in a given region. However, a favorable environment for human capital development would also be generated simultaneously.[1] The world's urban population in 1950 of just 746 million has increased to 3.9 billion in the decades since.[2] In 2009, the number of people living in urban areas (3.42 billion) surpassed the number living in rural areas (3.41 billion), and since then the world has become more urban than rural.[3] This was the first time that the majority of the world's population lived in a city.[4] In 2014 there were 7.2 billion people living on the planet,[5] of which the global urban population comprised 3.9 billion. The Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs at that time predicted the urban population would grow to 6.4 billion by 2050, with 37% of that growth to come from three countries: China, India and Nigeria.[2] The UN publishes data on cities, urban areas and rural areas, but relies almost entirely on national definitions of these areas. The UN principles and recommendations state that due to different characteristics of urban and rural areas across the globe, a global definition is not possible.[6] Urban areas are created and further developed by the process of urbanization. Urban areas are measured for various purposes, including analyzing population density and urban sprawl. Unlike an urban area, a metropolitan area includes not only the urban area, but also satellite cities plus intervening rural land that is socio-economically connected to the urban core city, typically by employment ties through commuting, with the urban core city being the primary labor market. The concept of an ""urban area"" as used in economic statistics should not be confused with the concept of the ""urban area"" used in road safety statistics. The last concept is also known as ""built-up area in road safety"". According to the definition by the Office for National Statistics, ""Built-up areas are defined as land which is 'irreversibly urban in character', meaning that they are characteristic of a town or city. They include areas of built-up land with a minimum of 20 hectares (200,000 m2; 49 acres). Any areas [separated by] less than 200 metres [of non-urban space] are linked to become a single built-up area.[7] Urban land area (km2), 2010[8] Urban areas with at least one million inhabitants in 2006 Contents 1 Definitions 1.1 East Asia 1.1.1 China 1.1.2 Japan 1.2 South Asia 1.2.1 India 1.2.2 Pakistan 1.2.3 Bangladesh 1.3 Southeast Asia 1.3.1 Philippines 1.3.2 Singapore 1.3.3 Vietnam 1.4 Europe 1.4.1 Finland 1.4.2 France 1.4.3 Germany 1.4.4 Netherlands 1.4.5 Sweden 1.4.6 United Kingdom 1.4.7 Norway 1.4.8 Poland 1.4.9 Russia 1.5 Oceania 1.5.1 Australia 1.5.2 New Zealand 1.6 North America 1.6.1 Canada 1.6.2 United States 1.7 South America 1.7.1 Argentina 1.7.2 Brazil 2 See also 3 References 4 External links Definitions[edit] European countries[which?] define urbanized areas on the basis of urban-type land use, not allowing any gaps of typically more than 200 metres (220 yd), and use satellite imagery instead of census blocks to determine the boundaries of the urban area. In less-developed countries[which?], in addition to land use and density requirements, a requirement that a large majority of the population, typically 75%, is not engaged in agriculture and/or fishing is sometimes used.[citation needed] East Asia[edit] China[edit] Main article: List of cities in China by population and built-up area Since 2000, China's cities have expanded at an average rate of 10% annually. It is estimated that China's urban population will increase by 292 million people by 2050,[2] when its cities will house a combined population of over one billion.[9] The country's urbanization rate increased from 17.4% to 46.6% between 1978 and 2009.[10] Between 150 and 200 million migrant workers work part-time in the major cities, returning home to the countryside periodically with their earnings.[11][12] Today, China has more cities with one million or more long-term residents than any other country, including the three global cities of Beijing, Hong Kong, and Shanghai; by 2025, the country will be home to 221 cities with over a million inhabitants.[9] The figures in the table below are from the 2008 census, and are only estimates of the urban populations within administrative city limits; a different ranking exists when considering the total municipal populations (which includes suburban and rural populations). The large ""floating populations"" of migrant workers make conducting censuses in urban areas difficult;[13] the figures below include only long-term residents. Panoramic view of Pudong's Skyline from the Bund in Shanghai. Japan[edit] In Japan urbanized areas are defined as contiguous areas of densely inhabited districts (DIDs) using census enumeration districts as units with a density requirement of 4,000 inhabitants per square kilometre (10,000/sq mi). South Asia[edit] India[edit] Main articles: Urbanisation in India and List of cities in India by population For the Census of India 2011, the definition of urban area is a place having a minimum population of 5,000 of density 400 persons per square kilometre (1,000/sq mi) or higher, and 75% plus of the male working population employed in non-agricultural activities. Places administered by a municipal corporation, cantonment board or notified town area committee are automatically considered urban areas.[14] The Census of India 2011 also defined the term ""urban agglomeration"" as an integrated urban area consisting of a core town together with its ""outgrowths"" (contiguous suburbs).[15] India gate panorama. vteLargest urban agglomerations in India by population(2011 census)[16][17] MumbaiDelhiKolkataChennaiBangaloreHyderabad Rank City Name State/Territory Population Rank City Name State/Territory Population AhmedabadPuneSuratJaipurKanpurLucknow 1 Mumbai Maharashtra 18,394,912 28 Ludhiana Punjab 1,618,879 2 Delhi Delhi 16,349,831 29 Nashik Maharashtra 1,562,769 3 Kolkata West Bengal 14,112,536 30 Vijayawada Andhra Pradesh 1,491,202 4 Chennai Tamil Nadu 8,696,010 31 Madurai Tamil Nadu 1,465,625 5 Bengaluru Karnataka 8,520,435 32 Varanasi Uttar Pradesh 1,435,113 6 Hyderabad Telangana 7,749,334 33 Meerut Uttar Pradesh 1,424,908 7 Ahmedabad Gujarat 6,361,084 34 Faridabad Haryana 1,414,050 8 Pune Maharashtra 5,057,709 35 Rajkot Gujarat 1,390,933 9 Surat Gujarat 4,591,246 36 Jamshedpur Jharkhand 1,339,438 10 Jaipur Rajasthan 3,073,350 37 Srinagar Jammu and Kashmir 1,273,312 11 Kanpur Uttar Pradesh 2,920,496 38 Jabalpur Madhya Pradesh 1,268,848 12 Lucknow Uttar Pradesh 2,902,920 39 Asansol West Bengal 1,243,414 13 Nagpur Maharashtra 2,497,870 40 Vasai-Virar Maharashtra 1,222,390 14 Ghaziabad Uttar Pradesh 2,375,820 41 Allahabad Uttar Pradesh 1,216,719 15 Indore Madhya Pradesh 2,170,295 42 Dhanbad Jharkhand 1,196,214 16 Coimbatore Tamil Nadu 2,151,466 43 Aurangabad Maharashtra 1,193,167 17 Kochi Kerala 2,119,724 44 Amritsar Punjab 1,183,705 18 Patna Bihar 2,049,156 45 Jodhpur Rajasthan 1,138,300 19 Kozhikode Kerala 2,030,519 46 Ranchi Jharkhand 1,126,741 20 Bhopal Madhya Pradesh 1,886,100 47 Raipur Chhattisgarh 1,123,558 21 Thrissur Kerala 1,861,269 48 Kollam Kerala 1,110,668 22 Vadodara Gujarat 1,822,221 49 Gwalior Madhya Pradesh 1,102,884 23 Agra Uttar Pradesh 1,760,285 50 Bhilai Chhattisgarh 1,064,222 24 Vishakhapatnam Andhra Pradesh 1,730,320 51 Chandigarh Chandigarh 1,026,459 25 Malappuram Kerala 1,699,060 52 Tiruchirappalli Tamil Nadu 1,022,518 26 Thiruvananthapuram Kerala 1,687,406 53 Kota Rajasthan 1,001,694 27 Kannur Kerala 1,642,892 54 Mysore Karnataka 990,900 Pakistan[edit] Main articles: Urbanisation in Pakistan and List of most populous cities in Pakistan In Pakistan, an area is a major city and municipality if it has more than 100,000 inhabitants according to census results. Cities include adjacent cantonments. Urbanisation in Pakistan has increased since the time of independence and has several different causes. The majority of southern Pakistan's population lives along the Indus River. Karachi is its most populous city.[18] In the northern half of the country, most of the population lives in an arc formed by the cities of Lahore, Faisalabad, Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Gujrat, Jhelum, Sargodha, Sheikhupura, Nowshera, Mardan and Peshawar. During 1990–2008, city dwellers made up 36% of Pakistan's population, making it the most urbanised nation in South Asia. Furthermore, 50% of Pakistanis live in towns of 5,000 people or more.[19] Karachi is the most populated city in Pakistan closely followed by Lahore according to the 2017 Census. Bangladesh[edit] In Bangladesh, there are total 532 urban areas, which are divided into three categories. Those are City Corporation, Municipal Corporation (Pourasova) and Upazila town. Among those urban areas, Dhaka is the largest city by population and area, with a population of 19.10 million.[20] In Bangladesh, there are total 11 City Corporations and 329 Municipal Corporations and 203 Small towns, which serves as the center for Upazilas. According to 2011 population census, Bangladesh has an urban population of 28%, with a growth rate of 2.8%.[21] At this growth rate, it is estimated that the urban population of Bangladesh will reach 79 million or 42% of total population by 2035.

With 64 islands and islets, Singapore Island makes up the largest urban area in the country. According to the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the country has the highest urbanised population in Southeast Asia, with 100 percent of its population living in an urban area.[23] The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) is responsible for the urban land-use planning, which designates land use and urban density of the country.[24] The country is divided into 5 regions for planning purposes by the URA, even though as a city state Singapore is defined as a single continuous urban area. It is further subdivided into 55 urban planning areas, which acts as the boundaries of planned towns within the country.[25] Vietnam[edit] In Vietnam, there are 6 types of urban areas: Special urban area (2 municipalities): Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. Type I urban area (18 provincial cities and 3 municipalities): Long Xuyên, Pleiku, Mỹ Tho, Thủ Dầu Một, Bắc Ninh, Biên Hòa, Hải Dương, Thanh Hóa, Hạ Long, Việt Trì, Thái Nguyên, Nam Định, Vũng Tàu, Buôn Ma Thuột, Đà Lạt, Quy Nhơn, Nha Trang, Huế, Vinh, Cần Thơ, Đà Nẵng and Hải Phòng.

Type III urban area (31 provincial cities and 12 towns). Type IV urban area (35 towns and 35 townships). Type V urban area (586 townships and 54 communes). Europe[edit] Finland[edit] Main articles: Urban areas in Finland and List of urban areas in Finland by population A street sign indicating the beginning of an urban area in Finland. The picture was taken in Vimpeli. As in other Nordic countries, an urban area (taajama in Finnish) in Finland must have a building at least every 200 m (660 ft) and at least 200 people. To be considered a town or a city (kaupunki) for statistical purposes, an urban area must have at least 15,000 people. This is not to be confused with the city / town designation used by municipalities.[26][27] France[edit] Main article: Urban area (France) In France, an urban area (Fr: aire urbaine) is a zone encompassing an area of built-up growth (called an ""urban unit"" (unité urbaine)[28] – close in definition to the North American urban area) and its commuter belt (couronne). Americans would find the INSEE definition of the urban area[29] to be similar to their metropolitan area, and the INSEE sometimes uses the term aire métropolitaine[30] to refer to the country's largest aires urbaines. The largest cities in France, in terms of urban area population (2017), are Paris (12,628,266), Lyon (2,323,221), Marseille (1,760,653), Toulouse (1,360,829), Bordeaux (1,247,977), Lille (1,191,117), Nice (1,006,201), Nantes (972,828), Strasbourg (790,087) and Rennes (733,320).[31] Panorama of Paris as seen from the Eiffel Tower as full 360-degree view (river flowing from north-east to south-west, right to left) Germany[edit] Germany has a number of large cities.

The Randstad is the country's largest conurbation located in the west of the country and contains the four largest cities: Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, and Utrecht. The Randstad has a population of 7 million inhabitants and is the 6th largest metropolitan area in Europe. Sweden[edit] Main article: List of urban areas in Sweden by population Urban areas in Sweden (tätorter) are statistically defined localities, totally independent of the administrative subdivision of the country. There are 1,956 such localities in Sweden, with a population ranging from 200 to 1,372,000 inhabitants.[33] United Kingdom[edit] Main article: List of urban areas in the United Kingdom In 2013 the United Kingdom's Office for National Statistics (ONS) published 2011 Built-up Areas - Methodology and Guidance which sets out its definition of a built-up area as an area of built-up land of at least 20 hectares (0.077 sq mi), separated from other settlements by at least 200 metres (660 ft). For 2011 census data there are 5,493 built-up areas, of which 501 are divided into sub-divisions for which data is also available. Each built-up area is named algorithmically, using Ordnance Survey place-name data.[34] The ONS has produced census results from urban areas since 1951, since 1981 based upon the extent of irreversible urban development indicated on Ordnance Survey maps. The definition is an extent of at least 20 ha and at least 1,500 census residents. Separate areas are linked if less than 200 m (220 yd) apart. Included are transportation features.[35] The UK has five Urban Areas with a population over a million and a further sixty nine with a population over one hundred thousand. vte Largest urban areas of the United Kingdom(England and Wales: 2011 census built-up area;[36] Scotland: 2016 estimates settlement;[37] Northern Ireland: 2001 census urban area)[38] Rank Urban area Pop.

Groups of houses less than 400 m from the main body of an urban area are included in the urban area.[39] Poland[edit] In Poland, official ""urban"" population figures simply refer to those localities which have the status of towns (miasta). The ""rural"" population is that of all areas outside the boundaries of these towns. This distinction may give a misleading impression in some cases, since some localities with only village status may have acquired larger and denser populations than many many smaller towns.[40] On the other hand, the Upper Silesian Industrial Region covers 3,200 km and has approximately 3 million people. Russia[edit] Moscow, the capital and largest city of Russia, has a population estimated at 12.4 million residents within the city limits,[41] while over 17 million residents in the urban area,[42] and over 20 million residents in the Moscow Metropolitan Area.[43] It is among the world's largest cities, being the most populous city entirely within Europe, the most populous urban area in Europe,[42] the most populous metropolitan area in Europe,[43] and also the largest city by land area on the European continent.[44] Saint Petersburg, the cultural capital, is the second-largest city, with a population of roughly 5.4 million inhabitants.[45] Other major urban areas are Yekaterinburg, Novosibirsk, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod, and Chelyabinsk. Moscow, the capital and largest city of Russia Saint Petersburg, the cultural capital and the second-largest city Yekaterinburg, the fourth-largest city in the country. Oceania[edit] Australia[edit] In Australia, urban areas are referred to as ""urban centres"" and are defined as population clusters of 1,000 or more people, with a density of at least 200/km2 (518/sq mi)[46] Australia is one of the most urbanised countries in the world, with more than 50% of the population residing in Australia's three biggest urban centres. Sydney is Australia's largest city, home to 5.3 million inhabitants.[47] New Zealand[edit] Main article: Urban areas of New Zealand Statistics New Zealand defines urban areas in New Zealand, which are independent of any administrative subdivisions and have no legal basis.[48] There are three classes of urban area: main urban areas are the 17 urban areas which have a population of 30,000 or more; secondary urban areas are the 14 urban areas which have a population of 10,000 or more but less than 30,000, and minor urban areas are the 103 urban areas which have a population of 1,000 or more but less than 10,000. Urban areas are reclassified after each New Zealand census, so population changes between censuses does not change an urban area's classification. North America[edit] Canada[edit] Main article: List of the largest population centres in Canada According to Statistics Canada, an urban area in Canada is an area with a population of at least 1,000 people where the density is no fewer than 400 persons per square kilometre (1,000/sq mi).[49] If two or more urban areas are within 2 km (1.2 mi) of each other by road, they are merged into a single urban area, provided they do not cross census metropolitan area or census agglomeration boundaries.[50] In the Canada 2011 Census, Statistics Canada redesignated urban areas with the new term ""population centre"";[51] the new term was chosen in order to better reflect the fact that urban vs. rural is not a strict division, but rather a continuum within which several distinct settlement patterns may exist. For example, a community may fit a strictly statistical definition of an urban area, but may not be commonly thought of as ""urban"" because it has a smaller population, or functions socially and economically as a suburb of another urban area rather than as a self-contained urban entity, or is geographically remote from other urban communities. Accordingly, the new definition set out three distinct types of population centres: small (population 1,000 to 29,999), medium (population 30,000 to 99,999) and large (population 100,000 or greater).[51] Despite the change in terminology, however, the demographic definition of a population centre remains unchanged from that of an urban area: a population of at least 1,000 people where the density is no fewer than 400 persons per km2. United States[edit] Main article: List of United States urban areas In the United States, there are two categories of urban area. The term urbanized area denotes an urban area of 50,000 or more people. Urban areas under 50,000 people are called urban clusters. Urbanized areas were first delineated in the United States in the 1950 census, while urban clusters were added in the 2000 census. There are 1,371 urban areas and urban clusters with more than 10,000 people. The U.S. Census Bureau defines an urban area as ""core census block groups or blocks that have a population density of at least 1,000 people per square mile (386 per square kilometer) and surrounding census blocks that have an overall density of at least 500 people per square mile (193 per square kilometer)"".[52] The largest urban area in the United States is the New York metropolitan area. The population of New York City, the core of the metropolitan area, exceeds 8.5 million people, its metropolitan statistical area has a population that is over 20 million, and its combined statistical area population is over 23 million. The next seven largest urban areas in the U.S. are Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Houston, and Atlanta.[53] About 82 percent of the population of the United States lives within the boundaries of an urbanized area as of December, 2010.[54] Combined, these areas occupy about 2 percent of the land area of the United States. Many Americans live in agglomerations of cities, suburbs, and towns that are adjacent to a metropolitan area's largest city.[citation needed] The skyscrapers of New York City, the most populous city in the United States and the most populous U.S. metropolitan area, are almost all situated in Manhattan, the world's largest central business district, seen here in this panorama in February 2018, as viewed from Weehawken, New Jersey.

For example, the city of Greenville, South Carolina has a city population just over 68,000 and an urbanized area population of around 400,000, while Greensboro, North Carolina has a city population just over 285,000 and an urbanized area population of around 300,000 — meaning that Greenville is actually ""larger"" for some intents and purposes, but not for others, such as taxation, local elections, etc. In the U.S. Department of Agriculture's natural resources inventory, urban areas are officially known as developed areas or urban and built-up areas. Such areas include cities, ethnic villages, other built-up areas of more than 10 ac (4 ha), industrial sites, railroad yards, cemeteries, airports, golf courses, shooting ranges, institutional and public administration sites, and similar areas. The 1997 national resources inventory placed over 98,000,000 ac (40,000,000 ha) in this category, an increase of 25,000,000 ac (10,000,000 ha) since 1982.[55] South America[edit] Argentina[edit] Argentina is highly urbanized.[56] The ten largest metropolitan areas account for half of the population, and fewer than one in ten live in rural areas. About 3 million people live in Buenos Aires City and the Greater Buenos Aires metropolitan area totals around 15 million, making it one of the largest urban areas in the world, with a population of 18 million all up.[57] Córdoba has around 1.5 million people living in the urban area, while Rosario, Mendoza and Tucumán have around 1.2 million inhabitants each[57] and La Plata, Mar del Plata, Salta and Santa Fe[57][58] have at least 500,000 people each. Brazil[edit] Main article: List of largest cities in Brazil According to IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) urban areas already concentrate 84.35% of the population, while the Southeast region remains the most populated one, with over 80 million inhabitants.[59] The largest metropolitan areas in Brazil are São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Belo Horizonte — all in the Southeastern Region — with 21, 12, and 5 million inhabitants respectively.[60] In general, state capitals are the largest cities in their states, except for Vitória, the capital of Espírito Santo, and Florianópolis, the capital of Santa Catarina. There are also non-capital metropolitan areas in the states of São Paulo (Campinas, Santos and the Paraíba Valley), Minas Gerais (Steel Valley), Rio Grande do Sul (Sinos Valley) and Santa Catarina (Itajaí Valley).[61] São Paulo, the largest city in Brazil, the largest city proper in the Southern Hemisphere, in the Americas, and the world's ninth-largest urban area by population.[62] vte Largest urban agglomerations in Brazil2017 Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics estimates[63][64][65] Rank Name State Pop.

Plagued by the unsustainable cost of incarceration, high recidivism rates, the devastating impact on children of incarcerating parents, the burden and collateral consequences of a criminal conviction, a “school to prison” pipeline borne out of excessively harsh academic disciplinary measures, and racial, economic, and geographic inequalities, our communities need alternatives to the traditional criminal justice model.

The Law School offers several degrees, including Juris Doctor (JD), Master of Laws (LLM) in Environmental Law, Master of Environmental Law and Policy (MELP), Master of Food and Agriculture Law and Policy (MFALP), Master of Energy Regulation and Law (MERL), and dual degrees with a diverse range of institutions. According to Vermont Law School's 2018 ABA-required disclosures, 61.5% of the Class of 2018 obtained full-time, long-term, JD-required employment nine months after graduation.[4] Contents 1 Campus 2 History 2.1 Solomon Amendment 3 Academics 3.1 Julien and Virginia Cornell Library 4 Centers, institutes, clinics, and programs 4.1 Law centers and research institutes 4.2 Clinics and experiential programs 5 Employment 6 Tuition and financial aid 7 Publications 8 Notable faculty and administrators 9 Notable alumni 10 See also 11 References 12 External links Campus[edit] Vermont Law School's 13-acre (5.3 ha) campus is located in South Royalton in central Vermont. The campus is set just above the broad banks of the White River. The oldest and centermost classroom building on the campus is the town's original schoolhouse, built in 1892. In 2005 the former town schoolhouse (the original Law School building in 1973) was renovated and renamed Debevoise Hall, after one of the first deans of the Law School, Thomas M. Debevoise. Practicing what it preaches, the Law School emphasized environmental concerns in the renovation, as well as historical preservation and design efficiency. Debevoise Hall was the only LEED Silver Certified renovation building project in the state of Vermont.[5] Debevoise Hall continues to serve as classroom space and now also houses administration offices, the Environmental Law Center, and the Yates Common Room.[6] The James L. and Evelena S. Oakes Hall building was constructed and dedicated in 1998. Oakes Hall incorporates ""green building"" techniques along with the latest classroom technology.[7] Jonathon Chase, the late former dean of the Law School, liked to joke that South Royalton was the only town in America ""with a law school and no stop light."" Vermont Law School holds the distinction of being the law school farthest from a traffic light, at 27 miles (43 km).[8] As of January 2021, South Royalton does not have a stoplight. In January 2020, VLS opened a new satellite office in Burlington, which hosts the school's immigration law clinic and additional admissions office.[9] History[edit] Vermont Law School was founded in 1972 by the late Dr. Anthony Doria and held its first classes in the summer of 1973 with 113 students in what was then known as the old South Royalton schoolhouse. In December 1973, VLS was certified by the Vermont State Board of Education as an institution of higher learning. Provisional ABA approval came in February 1975, and a full complement of classes were offered in the fall of 1975. The Law School's charter class graduated in spring 1976. Full approval by the ABA came in 1978, and the Law School was accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC) in 1980. VLS became a member of the Association of American Law Schools (AALS) in 1981.[6] In 2019, the Law School controversially stripped tenure from 75% of its faculty, citing financial exigencies.[10] Solomon Amendment[edit] Vermont Law School was one of two law schools in the U.S. to refuse cooperation with the Solomon Amendment, a statute passed by Congress requiring colleges and universities to allow military recruitment on campus or risk losing federal funding.[11] The school is also part of FAIR Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, a consortium of 38 law schools and law faculties that challenged the Solomon Amendment in Rumsfeld v. FAIR. Following the repeal of 'Don't Ask Don't Tell' in 2011, all law schools in the country now cooperate with the Solomon Amendment. Academics[edit] As well as the Juris Doctor (JD), the Law School offers several degrees and joint-degrees, as well as degrees with other universities. Degrees include Master of Laws (LLM) in Environmental Law, Master of Laws (LLM) in American Legal Studies, Master of Laws (LLM) in Food and Agriculture Law, and Master of Laws (LLM) in Energy Law; Master of Environmental Law and Policy (MELP), Master of Energy Regulation and Law (MERL), and Master of Food and Agriculture Law and Policy (MFALP). Vermont Law School also offers an Accelerated Juris Doctor program that allows JD students to graduate in just two years (as opposed to the traditional three-year JD program), through the completion of two full-time academic semesters during the summer.[12] The Law School has partnered with different domestic and international universities to offer dual-degree programs. Domestic schools include: Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies (JD/Master of Environmental Management), Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth (MELP/Master of Business Administration), the University of Vermont Rubenstein School of Natural Resources (MELP/Master of Science in Natural Resources), Thunderbird School of Global Management (JD/Masters of Business Administration), the University of South Carolina (MELP/JD), University of South Dakota (MELP/JD), and Northeastern University School of Law (MELP/JD). International universities include the University of Cambridge (JD/master of philosophy), Cergy-Pontoise University (France), and the University of Seville (Spain). Julien and Virginia Cornell Library[edit] The Julien and Virginia Cornell Library opened in 1991.[7] The library contains over 250,000 print volumes, including primary and secondary legal materials focusing on state, national, and international law.[13] The library also possesses a collection of microforms including congressional documents, state session laws, and briefs. The library's electronic collection includes access to LexisNexis and Westlaw and other online gateways and databases, as well as a large catalog of full-text electronic journals and books and databases offering primary legal materials. Vermont Law School maintains ""an extensive interdisciplinary environmental collection, including journals, monographs, electronic resources, and other material related to the study of the environment and environmental law and policy.""[14] Centers, institutes, clinics, and programs[edit] Law centers and research institutes[edit] Environmental Law Center—The Environmental Law Center (ELC) began in 1978 with eight master's degree students. As noted, the ELC's program is consistently top-ranked by U.S. News & World Report. The ELC confers both the Master of Environmental Law and Policy (MELP) and Master of Laws in Environmental Law (LLM) degrees. The Class of 2008 included 87 students receiving these master's degrees. Center for Agriculture and Food Systems (CAFS)—The Center for Agriculture and Food Systems (CAFS) has a dual mission: to train the next generation of food and agriculture advocates and entrepreneurs, and to create innovative legal tools supporting the new food movement. CAFS trains students through a comprehensive array of residential and distance learning courses and a Food and Agriculture Clinic. VLS offers a JD Certificate in Food and Agriculture, and both Master's and LLM degrees in Food and Agriculture Law and Policy. CAFS' diverse course offerings, law clinic and degree options make it the most comprehensive sustainable food, agriculture, and environmental law graduate program in the country. Institute for Energy & the Environment—The Institute for Energy and the Environment (IEE) is a national and international resource for energy law and policy. The institute offers a full course curriculum and a certificate of concentration during the academic year and through its Energy Summer seminars; distributes scholarly, technical, and practical publications; provides forums and conferences for professional education and issue development; and serves as a center for graduate research on energy issues, with an environmental awareness.[15] The Institute’s research team is selected from top students in the energy and environmental programs at Vermont Law School.[16] The Institute maintains the IEE blog focused on current events and research. Environmental Tax Policy Institute—The Institute analyzes ways in which taxation can address environmental problems. As a resource for the public and private sectors, non-governmental organizations, the press and academia, the Institute seeks to better inform the public policy debate about the role of environmental taxes at the local, state and federal levels. Land Use Institute—The Land Use Institute (LUI) addresses intensifying land use law and policy issues at the local, national, and international levels that critically pertain to the development of a sustainable society. These issues include application of smart growth principles, ecological planning, affordable housing, flood hazard mitigation, improving the confluence of energy and land use regulatory decision-making and other permitting processes, and land conservation strategies. LUI works with VLS faculty and students, and other nonprofit legal and professional planning partners, to provide sound and innovative information, experience, and education to advance the practice of land use law and planning. This mission is served through direct support for local and regional planning agencies, forums and conferences for issue development, preparation of legislation affecting critical land use issues, education and training for state and local land use planners and regulators, practical and scholarly publications, and graduate professional teaching. Clinics and experiential programs[edit] Environmental Advocacy Clinic—The Environmental Advocacy Clinic assists major conservation organizations and local community groups to promote access to justice on important environmental and natural resources issues.[17] In 2019, the National Wildlife Federation selected the Environmental Advocacy Clinic to represent the Federation on its national legal advocacy work.[18] Environmental Justice Clinic—Launched in 2019, the Environmental Justice Clinic became one of the only law clinics specifically devoted to environmental justice, providing legal services to low income communities and communities of color fighting the unjust distribution of pollution sources within those areas.[19] Energy Clinic—Started in 2014, the Energy Clinic is one of the only law clinics in the United States focused on promoting climate justice and renewable energy. The Energy Clinic provides opportunities for students to progressively develop the knowledge, skills, and values integral to the field of energy law and policy, while helping clients meet local energy needs with reliable, clean, and affordable resources.[20] Food and Agriculture Clinic—Students in the Food and Agriculture Clinic collaborate with local, regional, national, and international partners, and engage in law and policy work that addresses challenges related to food and land justice, public health, the economy, food security, and animal welfare.[21] South Royalton Legal Clinic—The South Royalton Legal Clinic serves Vermont residents who are unable to afford counsel and who need assistance with issues such as bankruptcy, children’s rights, disability, domestic violence, family law, housing, immigration, veterans issues and wills.[22] Legislative Clinic—In the Legislative Clinic, students to work under the supervision of attorneys supporting the work of the Vermont General Assembly. Under the supervision of the Vermont Legislative Council, students work on bills, amendments, and related research projects. They observe floor debates, attend committee hearings, and participate in hearings as needed by the committees.[23] Immigration Clinic—Expanded alongside the opening of the Burlington satellite office in 2020, this clinic offers assistance to Vermonters on issues of immigration law.[24] General Practice Program—The General Practice Program (GPP) was instituted in 1987. The GPP is recipient of the American Bar Association's E. Smythe Gambrell Award for Professionalism, a national award for law schools and other organizations in recognition for advancing professionalism in the practice of law. Legal Clinic of Petrozavodsk State University – Under the patronage of Vermont School of Law at the Faculty of Petrozavodsk State University opened the first legal clinic in Russia in October 1995, supported by the Council of Judges. Employment[edit] According to Vermont Law School's official 2018 ABA-required disclosures, 61.5% of the Class of 2018 obtained full-time, long-term, JD-required employment nine months after graduation.[4] Vermont Law School's Law School Transparency under-employment score is 29%, indicating the percentage of the Class of 2013 unemployed, pursuing an additional degree, or working in a non-professional, short-term, or part-time job nine months after graduation.[25] Tuition and financial aid[edit] JD tuition for 2018-19 is $48,254.[26] 67.4% percent of students receive some sort of scholarship.[1] Publications[edit] Vermont Law School students publish two legal journals, the Vermont Law Review and the Vermont Journal of Environmental Law, on a regular basis several times a year in print and online. In addition to regular publication, both journals sponsor annual symposia. Notable faculty and administrators[edit] Peter A.

As COVID-19 spread across the US in March 2020, the EPA announced a dramatic deregulation of environmental monitoring and enforcement. The announcement came three days after a request in writing by the American Petroleum Institute, which represents 600 oil and gas companies. This deregulation policy lifted oversight on all federally-regulated sources of pollution, including chemical manufacturing, coal-fired power plants, mining and smelting, sewage and waste facilities, and factory farms. By June, the EPA had further eased regulations intended to protect farmworkers against pesticide exposure. In the meantime, multiple studies early in the pandemic demonstrated links between poor air quality and health risks from COVID-19. This report is the first in-depth analysis of the EPA’s failure to address the environmental injustice of its policy allowing polluting industries to “self-regulate,” just as evidence was mounting about the connections between toxic air pollution and severe illness and death from COVID-19. The report calls for: an investigation into the impacts of EPA’s rollback; a mandate for all federal agencies to prioritize mitigation of harm to at-risk communities; monitoring tools for communities to assess environmental risks and harms, building on new EPA efforts to address health disparities; enforcement of EPA’s existing environmental and civil rights laws; and passing the Environmental Justice for All and Environmental Justice Acts to establish enforceable environmental justice and civil rights protections that cannot be ignored by future administrations. Authors include WE ACT for Environmental Justice, the Farmworker Association of Florida, Just Transition Alliance, Indigenous Environmental Network, and Los Jardines Institute, in partnership with the Vermont Law School Environmental Justice Clinic.

Verra’s standards and programs: Are trusted by a broad range of stakeholders, including NGOs, the private sector and governments, and are widely recognized and used in voluntary and compliance markets because they deliver credible and transparent assessments of project performance. Provide innovative solutions to environmental and social problems by identifying opportunities where clear and robust measurement and reporting of on-the-ground interventions can help tackle at scale the world’s most pressing challenges. Work for people and the planet by supporting projects and activities that deliver a range of benefits to communities and the environment. The standards and programs Verra develops and manages are globally applicable and advance action across a wide range of sectors and activities. All of our programs undergo extensive stakeholder consultation and expert review, and draw from four key components: standard,  independent assessment, accounting methodologies, and registry. How We Do It Standard Guiding principles High-level requirements Processes to follow Independent Assessment Accreditation of auditors Training of auditors Oversight Accounting Methodologies Establishing a baseline Monitoring requirements Enabling various interventions Registry Listing of program information Avoid double counting Transparency of results Standard: Establishes the core rules and requirements that must be met for any project, program or activity to be certified under the framework. Depending on the circumstances, our standards may set out higher-level requirements or, for more complex endeavors, include more detailed rules and procedures. Independent Assessment: Ensures that projects, programs and activities meet our standards. Where standards require independent auditing or verification, we establish processes for accrediting auditors, overseeing their work, and sanctioning them if they underperform. We provide support and oversight to established accreditation programs to ensure cost-effective and high-quality independent auditing. Accounting Methodologies: Allow for the determination of baselines (ie, what would have happened in the absence of the project, policy or program) and set out specific parameters for measuring, accounting and monitoring impacts. Registry: Displays the performance of projects, programs or activities to allow tracking of results or, in some cases, tradable units. The final programmatic component of a typical standards framework and essential to functioning certification markets, registries provide tracking services to account holders and transparent project documentation to the public.

The same is true for methodologies developed by the Climate Action Reserve, with the exception of their forest protocols. The current and valid version of a methodology must always be used.

their own methodology through the VCS methodology approval process. To ensure VCS remains the most robust and respected voluntary standard in the world, VCS periodically reviews approved methodologies to ensure they conform to current requirements, international best practices and scientific consensus. During this process, if it is determined that a methodology must be updated, revised or withdrawn, a grace period will apply for projects currently using the methodology. The status of each methodology is always displayed on the methodology page of the website. VCS projects must comply with the grace periods and rules set out by the relevant GHG program. For example, if a CDM methodology is withdrawn, a VCS project using that methodology must issue the project validation report by the CDM deadline for requesting project registration.

Nearly 1,700 certified VCS projects have collectively reduced or removed more than 630 million tonnes of carbon and other GHG emissions from the atmosphere. Individuals and corporations around the world are recognizing the importance of reducing their GHG emissions. As a result, many of them are reducing their carbon footprints through energy efficiency and other measures. Quite often, however, it is not possible for these entities to meet their targets or eliminate their carbon footprint, at least in the near term, with internal reductions alone, and they need a flexible mechanism to achieve these aspirational goals. Enter the carbon markets. By using the carbon markets, entities can neutralize, or offset, their emissions by retiring carbon credits generated by projects that are reducing GHG emissions elsewhere. Of course, it is critical to ensure, or verify, that the emission reductions generated by these projects are actually occurring. This is the work of the VCS Program – to ensure the credibility of emission reduction projects. Once projects have been certified against the VCS Program’s rigorous set of rules and requirements, project developers can be issued tradable GHG credits that we call Verified Carbon Units (VCUs).  Those VCUs can then be sold on the open market and retired by individuals and companies as a means to offset their own emissions. Over time, this flexibility channels financing to clean, innovative businesses and technologies. Verra’s role is to develop and administer the program. We provide oversight to all operational components of the VCS Program and we are responsible for updating the VCS rules such that they ensure the quality of VCUs. The development of the VCS Program is supported by the VCS Program Advisory Group, a multi-stakeholder body that helps ensure that the VCS Program continues to serve its users in an effective and efficient manner and drives practical and robust solutions to mitigate climate change. How It Works Projects developed under the VCS Program must follow a rigorous assessment process in order to be certified. VCS projects cover a diverse range of sectors, including renewable energy (such as wind and hydroelectric projects), forestry (including the avoidance of deforestation), and others. Emission reductions certified by our program are eligible to be issued as VCUs, with one VCU representing one metric tonne of greenhouse gas emissions reduced or removed from the atmosphere. VCS Standard: The VCS Standard lays out the rules and requirements which all projects must follow in order to be certified. Independent Auditing: All VCS projects are subject to desk and field audits by both qualified independent third parties and Verra staff to ensure that standards are met and methodologies are properly applied. Accounting Methodologies: Projects are assessed using a technically sound GHG emission reduction quantification methodology specific to that project type. Registry System: The registry system is the central storehouse of data on all registered projects, and tracks the generation, retirement and cancellation of all VCUs. To register with the program, projects must show that they have met all standards and methodological requirements. While VCS projects typically include a discrete set of activities, governments are now establishing policies and programs to mitigate GHG emissions across entire national or subnational jurisdictions. In the forest sector, these programs (called REDD+ programs) can be accounted for and credited using the world’s first jurisdictional-scale framework, the Verra Jurisdictional and Nested REDD+ (JNR) framework. JNR integrates government-led and project-level REDD+ activities and establishes a clear pathway for subnational- and project-level activities to be incorporated within broader REDD+ programs.

88,"Urban area - Wikipedia Urban area From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Human settlement with high population density and infrastructure of built environment ""Built up area"" redirects here. For the Highway Code, see Built-up area (Highway Code). ""Urban agglomeration"" redirects here. For city clusters, see Megalopolis. Greater Tokyo Area, Japan, the world's most populated urban area, with about 38 million inhabitants Greater Melbourne at night, seen from the International Space Station An urban area, or built-up area, is a human settlement with a high population density and infrastructure of built environment. Urban areas are created through urbanization and are categorized by urban morphology as cities, towns, conurbations or suburbs. In urbanism, the term contrasts to rural areas such as villages and hamlets; in urban sociology or urban anthropology it contrasts with natural environment. The creation of early predecessors of urban areas during the urban revolution led to the creation of human civilization with modern urban planning, which along with other human activities such as exploitation of natural resources led to a human impact on the environment. ""Agglomeration effects"" are in the list of the main consequences of increased rates of firm creation since. This is due to conditions created by a greater level of industrial activity in a given region. However, a favorable environment for human capital development would also be generated simultaneously.[1] The world's urban population in 1950 of just 746 million has increased to 3.9 billion in the decades since.[2] In 2009, the number of people living in urban areas (3.42 billion) surpassed the number living in rural areas (3.41 billion), and since then the world has become more urban than rural.[3] This was the first time that the majority of the world's population lived in a city.[4] In 2014 there were 7.2 billion people living on the planet,[5] of which the global urban population comprised 3.9 billion. The Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs at that time predicted the urban population would grow to 6.4 billion by 2050, with 37% of that growth to come from three countries: China, India and Nigeria.[2] The UN publishes data on cities, urban areas and rural areas, but relies almost entirely on national definitions of these areas. The UN principles and recommendations state that due to different characteristics of urban and rural areas across the globe, a global definition is not possible.[6] Urban areas are created and further developed by the process of urbanization. Urban areas are measured for various purposes, including analyzing population density and urban sprawl. Unlike an urban area, a metropolitan area includes not only the urban area, but also satellite cities plus intervening rural land that is socio-economically connected to the urban core city, typically by employment ties through commuting, with the urban core city being the primary labor market. The concept of an ""urban area"" as used in economic statistics should not be confused with the concept of the ""urban area"" used in road safety statistics. The last concept is also known as ""built-up area in road safety"". According to the definition by the Office for National Statistics, ""Built-up areas are defined as land which is 'irreversibly urban in character', meaning that they are characteristic of a town or city. They include areas of built-up land with a minimum of 20 hectares (200,000 m2; 49 acres).

In less-developed countries[which?], in addition to land use and density requirements, a requirement that a large majority of the population, typically 75%, is not engaged in agriculture and/or fishing is sometimes used.[citation needed] East Asia[edit] China[edit] Main article: List of cities in China by population and built-up area Since 2000, China's cities have expanded at an average rate of 10% annually. It is estimated that China's urban population will increase by 292 million people by 2050,[2] when its cities will house a combined population of over one billion.[9] The country's urbanization rate increased from 17.4% to 46.6% between 1978 and 2009.[10] Between 150 and 200 million migrant workers work part-time in the major cities, returning home to the countryside periodically with their earnings.[11][12] Today, China has more cities with one million or more long-term residents than any other country, including the three global cities of Beijing, Hong Kong, and Shanghai; by 2025, the country will be home to 221 cities with over a million inhabitants.[9] The figures in the table below are from the 2008 census, and are only estimates of the urban populations within administrative city limits; a different ranking exists when considering the total municipal populations (which includes suburban and rural populations). The large ""floating populations"" of migrant workers make conducting censuses in urban areas difficult;[13] the figures below include only long-term residents. Panoramic view of Pudong's Skyline from the Bund in Shanghai. Japan[edit] In Japan urbanized areas are defined as contiguous areas of densely inhabited districts (DIDs) using census enumeration districts as units with a density requirement of 4,000 inhabitants per square kilometre (10,000/sq mi). South Asia[edit] India[edit] Main articles: Urbanisation in India and List of cities in India by population For the Census of India 2011, the definition of urban area is a place having a minimum population of 5,000 of density 400 persons per square kilometre (1,000/sq mi) or higher, and 75% plus of the male working population employed in non-agricultural activities. Places administered by a municipal corporation, cantonment board or notified town area committee are automatically considered urban areas.[14] The Census of India 2011 also defined the term ""urban agglomeration"" as an integrated urban area consisting of a core town together with its ""outgrowths"" (contiguous suburbs).[15] India gate panorama. vteLargest urban agglomerations in India by population(2011 census)[16][17] MumbaiDelhiKolkataChennaiBangaloreHyderabad Rank City Name State/Territory Population Rank City Name State/Territory Population AhmedabadPuneSuratJaipurKanpurLucknow 1 Mumbai Maharashtra 18,394,912 28 Ludhiana Punjab 1,618,879 2 Delhi Delhi 16,349,831 29 Nashik Maharashtra 1,562,769 3 Kolkata West Bengal 14,112,536 30 Vijayawada Andhra Pradesh 1,491,202 4 Chennai Tamil Nadu 8,696,010 31 Madurai Tamil Nadu 1,465,625 5 Bengaluru Karnataka 8,520,435 32 Varanasi Uttar Pradesh 1,435,113 6 Hyderabad Telangana 7,749,334 33 Meerut Uttar Pradesh 1,424,908 7 Ahmedabad Gujarat 6,361,084 34 Faridabad Haryana 1,414,050 8 Pune Maharashtra 5,057,709 35 Rajkot Gujarat 1,390,933 9 Surat Gujarat 4,591,246 36 Jamshedpur Jharkhand 1,339,438 10 Jaipur Rajasthan 3,073,350 37 Srinagar Jammu and Kashmir 1,273,312 11 Kanpur Uttar Pradesh 2,920,496 38 Jabalpur Madhya Pradesh 1,268,848 12 Lucknow Uttar Pradesh 2,902,920 39 Asansol West Bengal 1,243,414 13 Nagpur Maharashtra 2,497,870 40 Vasai-Virar Maharashtra 1,222,390 14 Ghaziabad Uttar Pradesh 2,375,820 41 Allahabad Uttar Pradesh 1,216,719 15 Indore Madhya Pradesh 2,170,295 42 Dhanbad Jharkhand 1,196,214 16 Coimbatore Tamil Nadu 2,151,466 43 Aurangabad Maharashtra 1,193,167 17 Kochi Kerala 2,119,724 44 Amritsar Punjab 1,183,705 18 Patna Bihar 2,049,156 45 Jodhpur Rajasthan 1,138,300 19 Kozhikode Kerala 2,030,519 46 Ranchi Jharkhand 1,126,741 20 Bhopal Madhya Pradesh 1,886,100 47 Raipur Chhattisgarh 1,123,558 21 Thrissur Kerala 1,861,269 48 Kollam Kerala 1,110,668 22 Vadodara Gujarat 1,822,221 49 Gwalior Madhya Pradesh 1,102,884 23 Agra Uttar Pradesh 1,760,285 50 Bhilai Chhattisgarh 1,064,222 24 Vishakhapatnam Andhra Pradesh 1,730,320 51 Chandigarh Chandigarh 1,026,459 25 Malappuram Kerala 1,699,060 52 Tiruchirappalli Tamil Nadu 1,022,518 26 Thiruvananthapuram Kerala 1,687,406 53 Kota Rajasthan 1,001,694 27 Kannur Kerala 1,642,892 54 Mysore Karnataka 990,900 Pakistan[edit] Main articles: Urbanisation in Pakistan and List of most populous cities in Pakistan In Pakistan, an area is a major city and municipality if it has more than 100,000 inhabitants according to census results. Cities include adjacent cantonments. Urbanisation in Pakistan has increased since the time of independence and has several different causes. The majority of southern Pakistan's population lives along the Indus River. Karachi is its most populous city.[18] In the northern half of the country, most of the population lives in an arc formed by the cities of Lahore, Faisalabad, Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Gujrat, Jhelum, Sargodha, Sheikhupura, Nowshera, Mardan and Peshawar. During 1990–2008, city dwellers made up 36% of Pakistan's population, making it the most urbanised nation in South Asia. Furthermore, 50% of Pakistanis live in towns of 5,000 people or more.[19] Karachi is the most populated city in Pakistan closely followed by Lahore according to the 2017 Census. Bangladesh[edit] In Bangladesh, there are total 532 urban areas, which are divided into three categories. Those are City Corporation, Municipal Corporation (Pourasova) and Upazila town. Among those urban areas, Dhaka is the largest city by population and area, with a population of 19.10 million.[20] In Bangladesh, there are total 11 City Corporations and 329 Municipal Corporations and 203 Small towns, which serves as the center for Upazilas. According to 2011 population census, Bangladesh has an urban population of 28%, with a growth rate of 2.8%.[21] At this growth rate, it is estimated that the urban population of Bangladesh will reach 79 million or 42% of total population by 2035.

With 64 islands and islets, Singapore Island makes up the largest urban area in the country. According to the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the country has the highest urbanised population in Southeast Asia, with 100 percent of its population living in an urban area.[23] The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) is responsible for the urban land-use planning, which designates land use and urban density of the country.[24] The country is divided into 5 regions for planning purposes by the URA, even though as a city state Singapore is defined as a single continuous urban area. It is further subdivided into 55 urban planning areas, which acts as the boundaries of planned towns within the country.[25] Vietnam[edit] In Vietnam, there are 6 types of urban areas: Special urban area (2 municipalities): Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. Type I urban area (18 provincial cities and 3 municipalities): Long Xuyên, Pleiku, Mỹ Tho, Thủ Dầu Một, Bắc Ninh, Biên Hòa, Hải Dương, Thanh Hóa, Hạ Long, Việt Trì, Thái Nguyên, Nam Định, Vũng Tàu, Buôn Ma Thuột, Đà Lạt, Quy Nhơn, Nha Trang, Huế, Vinh, Cần Thơ, Đà Nẵng and Hải Phòng.

Type III urban area (31 provincial cities and 12 towns). Type IV urban area (35 towns and 35 townships). Type V urban area (586 townships and 54 communes). Europe[edit] Finland[edit] Main articles: Urban areas in Finland and List of urban areas in Finland by population A street sign indicating the beginning of an urban area in Finland. The picture was taken in Vimpeli. As in other Nordic countries, an urban area (taajama in Finnish) in Finland must have a building at least every 200 m (660 ft) and at least 200 people. To be considered a town or a city (kaupunki) for statistical purposes, an urban area must have at least 15,000 people. This is not to be confused with the city / town designation used by municipalities.[26][27] France[edit] Main article: Urban area (France) In France, an urban area (Fr: aire urbaine) is a zone encompassing an area of built-up growth (called an ""urban unit"" (unité urbaine)[28] – close in definition to the North American urban area) and its commuter belt (couronne). Americans would find the INSEE definition of the urban area[29] to be similar to their metropolitan area, and the INSEE sometimes uses the term aire métropolitaine[30] to refer to the country's largest aires urbaines. The largest cities in France, in terms of urban area population (2017), are Paris (12,628,266), Lyon (2,323,221), Marseille (1,760,653), Toulouse (1,360,829), Bordeaux (1,247,977), Lille (1,191,117), Nice (1,006,201), Nantes (972,828), Strasbourg (790,087) and Rennes (733,320).[31] Panorama of Paris as seen from the Eiffel Tower as full 360-degree view (river flowing from north-east to south-west, right to left) Germany[edit] Germany has a number of large cities. The largest conurbation is the Rhine-Ruhr region (11 million in 2008[update]), including Düsseldorf (the capital of North Rhine-Westphalia), Cologne, Bonn, Dortmund, Essen, Duisburg, and Bochum.[32] vte Largest urban agglomerations in GermanyFederal Statistical Office of Germany (31 December 2017) Rank Name State Pop.

The Randstad is the country's largest conurbation located in the west of the country and contains the four largest cities: Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, and Utrecht. The Randstad has a population of 7 million inhabitants and is the 6th largest metropolitan area in Europe. Sweden[edit] Main article: List of urban areas in Sweden by population Urban areas in Sweden (tätorter) are statistically defined localities, totally independent of the administrative subdivision of the country. There are 1,956 such localities in Sweden, with a population ranging from 200 to 1,372,000 inhabitants.[33] United Kingdom[edit] Main article: List of urban areas in the United Kingdom In 2013 the United Kingdom's Office for National Statistics (ONS) published 2011 Built-up Areas - Methodology and Guidance which sets out its definition of a built-up area as an area of built-up land of at least 20 hectares (0.077 sq mi), separated from other settlements by at least 200 metres (660 ft). For 2011 census data there are 5,493 built-up areas, of which 501 are divided into sub-divisions for which data is also available. Each built-up area is named algorithmically, using Ordnance Survey place-name data.[34] The ONS has produced census results from urban areas since 1951, since 1981 based upon the extent of irreversible urban development indicated on Ordnance Survey maps. The definition is an extent of at least 20 ha and at least 1,500 census residents. Separate areas are linked if less than 200 m (220 yd) apart. Included are transportation features.[35] The UK has five Urban Areas with a population over a million and a further sixty nine with a population over one hundred thousand. vte Largest urban areas of the United Kingdom(England and Wales: 2011 census built-up area;[36] Scotland: 2016 estimates settlement;[37] Northern Ireland: 2001 census urban area)[38] Rank Urban area Pop.

Unlike in Denmark and Sweden, the distance between each building has to be of less than 50 m, although exceptions are made due to parks, industrial areas, rivers, and similar. Groups of houses less than 400 m from the main body of an urban area are included in the urban area.[39] Poland[edit] In Poland, official ""urban"" population figures simply refer to those localities which have the status of towns (miasta). The ""rural"" population is that of all areas outside the boundaries of these towns. This distinction may give a misleading impression in some cases, since some localities with only village status may have acquired larger and denser populations than many many smaller towns.[40] On the other hand, the Upper Silesian Industrial Region covers 3,200 km and has approximately 3 million people. Russia[edit] Moscow, the capital and largest city of Russia, has a population estimated at 12.4 million residents within the city limits,[41] while over 17 million residents in the urban area,[42] and over 20 million residents in the Moscow Metropolitan Area.[43] It is among the world's largest cities, being the most populous city entirely within Europe, the most populous urban area in Europe,[42] the most populous metropolitan area in Europe,[43] and also the largest city by land area on the European continent.[44] Saint Petersburg, the cultural capital, is the second-largest city, with a population of roughly 5.4 million inhabitants.[45] Other major urban areas are Yekaterinburg, Novosibirsk, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod, and Chelyabinsk. Moscow, the capital and largest city of Russia Saint Petersburg, the cultural capital and the second-largest city Yekaterinburg, the fourth-largest city in the country. Oceania[edit] Australia[edit] In Australia, urban areas are referred to as ""urban centres"" and are defined as population clusters of 1,000 or more people, with a density of at least 200/km2 (518/sq mi)[46] Australia is one of the most urbanised countries in the world, with more than 50% of the population residing in Australia's three biggest urban centres. Sydney is Australia's largest city, home to 5.3 million inhabitants.[47] New Zealand[edit] Main article: Urban areas of New Zealand Statistics New Zealand defines urban areas in New Zealand, which are independent of any administrative subdivisions and have no legal basis.[48] There are three classes of urban area: main urban areas are the 17 urban areas which have a population of 30,000 or more; secondary urban areas are the 14 urban areas which have a population of 10,000 or more but less than 30,000, and minor urban areas are the 103 urban areas which have a population of 1,000 or more but less than 10,000. Urban areas are reclassified after each New Zealand census, so population changes between censuses does not change an urban area's classification. North America[edit] Canada[edit] Main article: List of the largest population centres in Canada According to Statistics Canada, an urban area in Canada is an area with a population of at least 1,000 people where the density is no fewer than 400 persons per square kilometre (1,000/sq mi).[49] If two or more urban areas are within 2 km (1.2 mi) of each other by road, they are merged into a single urban area, provided they do not cross census metropolitan area or census agglomeration boundaries.[50] In the Canada 2011 Census, Statistics Canada redesignated urban areas with the new term ""population centre"";[51] the new term was chosen in order to better reflect the fact that urban vs. rural is not a strict division, but rather a continuum within which several distinct settlement patterns may exist. For example, a community may fit a strictly statistical definition of an urban area, but may not be commonly thought of as ""urban"" because it has a smaller population, or functions socially and economically as a suburb of another urban area rather than as a self-contained urban entity, or is geographically remote from other urban communities. Accordingly, the new definition set out three distinct types of population centres: small (population 1,000 to 29,999), medium (population 30,000 to 99,999) and large (population 100,000 or greater).[51] Despite the change in terminology, however, the demographic definition of a population centre remains unchanged from that of an urban area: a population of at least 1,000 people where the density is no fewer than 400 persons per km2. United States[edit] Main article: List of United States urban areas In the United States, there are two categories of urban area. The term urbanized area denotes an urban area of 50,000 or more people. Urban areas under 50,000 people are called urban clusters. Urbanized areas were first delineated in the United States in the 1950 census, while urban clusters were added in the 2000 census. There are 1,371 urban areas and urban clusters with more than 10,000 people. The U.S. Census Bureau defines an urban area as ""core census block groups or blocks that have a population density of at least 1,000 people per square mile (386 per square kilometer) and surrounding census blocks that have an overall density of at least 500 people per square mile (193 per square kilometer)"".[52] The largest urban area in the United States is the New York metropolitan area. The population of New York City, the core of the metropolitan area, exceeds 8.5 million people, its metropolitan statistical area has a population that is over 20 million, and its combined statistical area population is over 23 million. The next seven largest urban areas in the U.S. are Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Houston, and Atlanta.[53] About 82 percent of the population of the United States lives within the boundaries of an urbanized area as of December, 2010.[54] Combined, these areas occupy about 2 percent of the land area of the United States. Many Americans live in agglomerations of cities, suburbs, and towns that are adjacent to a metropolitan area's largest city.[citation needed] The skyscrapers of New York City, the most populous city in the United States and the most populous U.S. metropolitan area, are almost all situated in Manhattan, the world's largest central business district, seen here in this panorama in February 2018, as viewed from Weehawken, New Jersey.

For example, the city of Greenville, South Carolina has a city population just over 68,000 and an urbanized area population of around 400,000, while Greensboro, North Carolina has a city population just over 285,000 and an urbanized area population of around 300,000 — meaning that Greenville is actually ""larger"" for some intents and purposes, but not for others, such as taxation, local elections, etc. In the U.S. Department of Agriculture's natural resources inventory, urban areas are officially known as developed areas or urban and built-up areas. Such areas include cities, ethnic villages, other built-up areas of more than 10 ac (4 ha), industrial sites, railroad yards, cemeteries, airports, golf courses, shooting ranges, institutional and public administration sites, and similar areas. The 1997 national resources inventory placed over 98,000,000 ac (40,000,000 ha) in this category, an increase of 25,000,000 ac (10,000,000 ha) since 1982.[55] South America[edit] Argentina[edit] Argentina is highly urbanized.[56] The ten largest metropolitan areas account for half of the population, and fewer than one in ten live in rural areas. About 3 million people live in Buenos Aires City and the Greater Buenos Aires metropolitan area totals around 15 million, making it one of the largest urban areas in the world, with a population of 18 million all up.[57] Córdoba has around 1.5 million people living in the urban area, while Rosario, Mendoza and Tucumán have around 1.2 million inhabitants each[57] and La Plata, Mar del Plata, Salta and Santa Fe[57][58] have at least 500,000 people each. Brazil[edit] Main article: List of largest cities in Brazil According to IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) urban areas already concentrate 84.35% of the population, while the Southeast region remains the most populated one, with over 80 million inhabitants.[59] The largest metropolitan areas in Brazil are São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Belo Horizonte — all in the Southeastern Region — with 21, 12, and 5 million inhabitants respectively.[60] In general, state capitals are the largest cities in their states, except for Vitória, the capital of Espírito Santo, and Florianópolis, the capital of Santa Catarina. There are also non-capital metropolitan areas in the states of São Paulo (Campinas, Santos and the Paraíba Valley), Minas Gerais (Steel Valley), Rio Grande do Sul (Sinos Valley) and Santa Catarina (Itajaí Valley).[61] São Paulo, the largest city in Brazil, the largest city proper in the Southern Hemisphere, in the Americas, and the world's ninth-largest urban area by population.[62] vte Largest urban agglomerations in Brazil2017 Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics estimates[63][64][65] Rank Name State Pop.

It was established in 1897 by Act of Parliament, and was a constituent college of the University of New Zealand. The university is well known for its programmes in law, the humanities, and some scientific disciplines, and offers a broad range of other courses. Entry to all courses at first year is open, and entry to second year in some programmes (e.g. law, criminology, creative writing, architecture, engineering[8]) is restricted. Victoria had the highest average research grade in the New Zealand Government's Performance-Based Research Fund exercise in both 2012 and 2018, having been ranked 4th in 2006 and 3rd in 2003.[9] Victoria has been ranked 215th in the World's Top 500 universities by the QS World University Rankings (2020).[6] Contents 1 History 1.1 Early History and Colonial Politics 1.2 Establishment 1.3 Founding Professors 1.4 Early days 1.5 Kelburn Campus 1.6 Development 1.7 Name-change proposal 2 Governance and administration 3 Campuses and facilities 3.1 Wellington 3.2 Auckland 3.3 Other facilities 3.4 Library 3.5 Campus Developments 3.5.1 Te Huanui and 320 The Terrace 3.5.2 National Centre for Music 3.5.3 The Living Pā 4 Organisation and administration 4.1 Faculties 4.1.1 Faculty of Law 5 Academic profile 5.1 Academic rankings 6 Research centres and institutes 7 Student life 7.1 Students' associations and student media 7.2 Halls of residence 8 Controversies 9 Notable academics and staff 10 Notable alumni 11 See also 12 References 13 External links History[edit] Victoria University of Wellington (originally known as Victoria University College) was founded in 1897, named after Queen Victoria, on the 60th anniversary of her coronation.[10] The original name was Victoria University College, but on the dissolution of the University of New Zealand in 1961 Victoria or ""Vic"" became the Victoria University of Wellington, conferring its own degrees. Early History and Colonial Politics[edit] In 1868, the colonial government of New Zealand passed the University Endowment Act of 1868, which established scholarship programs for study in the home islands of Great Britain, in addition to setting aside a land endowment in the burgeoning colony itself. The following year, with wealth generated from the Otago Gold Rush in addition to a strong foundation of the Scottish Enlightenment, the provincial government of Otago proceeded to lay the groundwork to establish the University of Otago. This was followed by the creation of Canterbury College, associated with the newly formed University of New Zealand. Robert Stout 'The Father of Victoria College' In 1878, a royal commission was appointed to review the state of higher education in the country. It recommended the establishment of a federal system of four university colleges, established in Auckland and Wellington, in addition to the integration of the University of Otago and Canterbury College. The colonial government moved to provide sites, statutory grants and land endowments. This was somewhat delayed after the state of recession caused by the collapse of the City of Glasgow Bank in the same year, leading to a contraction in credit from Great Britain, and specifically London, the centre of global finance at the time. Nevertheless, in 1882, parliament passed the Auckland University College Act in 1882. The growth of the population of Wellington, and the gradual improvement of the economy in the late 1880s were key factors in the final establishment of the college. A prominent advocate of creation was Robert Stout, Premier of New Zealand and later Chief Justice, as well as a member of the university senate. In June 1886, as Minister of Education, Stout signalled the governments intent of introducing a bill to establish a centre for higher learning in Wellington. Being the centre of the colonial government, Stout cited the opportunity for the college to be able to particularly specialize in law, political science, and history. Stout further suggested that the staff of the New Zealand Colonial Museum could provide services in the fields of geology and natural history. This was indicated in the Wellington University College Bill of 1887, which meant the effective annexation of the museum. Colonial Museum director James Hector voiced considerable opposition to this bill. After a lengthy debate in parliament, this bill was promptly defeated. Establishment[edit] In 1897, the current premier, Richard Seddon, who had until this point been unsupportive of the university project, returned from Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee celebrations in Great Britain with an honorary Law degree from the University of Cambridge. Seddon decided that the establishment of a college in Wellington would be a suitable way to mark the Queen's jubilee year. When introducing the Victoria College Bill in December 1897, Seddon stated: ‘I do not think there will be any question as to the necessity for the establishment of a University College here in Wellington,’ The college was to be governed by a 16-man council, with their inaugural meeting taking place on the 23rd of May 1898. Founding Professors[edit] The founding professors of Victoria college were: John Rankine Brown[11] - Professor of Classics Hugh Mackenzie - Professor of English language and Literature Thomas Hill Easterfield[12] - Professor of Chemistry and Physics Richard Cockburn Maclaurin[13] - Professor of Mathematics Wellington Girls High School building situated on the right, where early classes were held. Early days[edit] While Victoria College had been legally founded, a grand, a council and a number of students, it had no physical property for the first decade of its existence. Early courses were held at Wellington Girls High School as well as the Technical School building on Victoria Street.[10] The professors set about creating a unique identity for the college. The somewhat fitting motto ""Sapientia magis auro desideranda"" was adopted in 1902. In 1903, the college adopted a badge and coat of arms featuring three crowns, the stars of the southern cross and the crest of the namesake of Wellington. It was at this time that the colours of the college were chosen; dark green and gold, taking inspiration of the colours of the nearby gorse covered Tinakori Hill. In 1903 the council intended to establish a professorship in law, ‘with a desire of to making the Law School at Wellington the most complete in the Colony’, as soon as financially possible. The college appointed a fifth professor, in modern languages - selecting the Oxford educated Anglo-German George von Zedlitz. Zelditz was joined by a newly appointed New Zealand-educated biology professor Harry Borrer Kirk. The 1903 plan for the University Campus at Kelburn[14] Kelburn Campus[edit] The Hunter BuildingThe newly appointed Council in 1889 had considered the use of the 13-acre Alexandra Barracks site for a permanent campus. The site was widely supported in Wellington, but release of the land for academic purposes was stalled by the Seddon Government.[15] In February 1901 an offer was made by a wealthy Wairarapa sheep farmer named Charles Pharazyn. Pharazyn offered to donate £1000 if the college was built on a 6-acre plot of hilly land in Kelburn. Coincidentally, Pharazyn held a major financial interest in the then-under construction Kelburn - Karori Tramway (now known as the Wellington Cable Car). The Tramway was completed the following year, and to this day transports students from the central business area of Lambton Quay, to the university via Salamanca Station.[16] Construction began in 1902, with the regrading of the hillside, with the construction of a main building following shortly after, designed by local architects F. Penty and E.M. Blake in the Gothic Revival style. At the requests of Richard Seddon, the building gained a more imposing demeanor through the insistence of adding a third level. The then governor of New Zealand, Lord Plunket, laid the foundation stone on the 27th of August 1904. While opened on the 30th of March 1906, the building was not completed to its original design, but was progressively added to as the college grew. In the meantime, students had built tennis courts, as well as a wooden gymnasium and social hall being constructed. The building was named after Thomas Alexander Hunter, the well-regarded professor of mental science and political economy. Following the end of the First World War, north and south wings were added to the building, providing new teaching areas, recreational spaces, and a new library. Development[edit] An extramural branch was founded at Palmerston North in 1960. It merged with Massey College on 1 January 1963. Having become a branch of Victoria upon the University of New Zealand's 1961 demise, the merged college became Massey University on 1 January 1964.[17] In 2004, Victoria celebrated the 100th birthday of its first home, the Hunter Building. Victoria has expanded beyond its original campus in Kelburn, with campuses in Te Aro (Faculty of Architecture and Design), and Pipitea (opposite Parliament, housing the Faculty of Law and Victoria Business School). Victoria also hosts the Ferrier Research Institute and the Robinson Research Institute in Lower Hutt, the Coastal Ecology Laboratory in Island Bay and the Miramar Creative Centre, in Park Rd, Miramar. In 2015, Victoria opened a new campus in Auckland to service the growing demand for its courses and expertise.[18] Name-change proposal[edit] The Te Toki a Rata building was completed in 2017, and houses the School of Biological Sciences In May 2018 it was reported that Victoria was exploring options to simplify its name to University of Wellington[19] (as distinct from Wellington University in Fort Collins, Colorado and other entities).[20] Vice-Chancellor Grant Guillford said that the university was pursuing a name change in order to reduce confusion overseas, as several other universities also carried the ""Victoria"" name.[21] On 27 July 2018, the Victoria University of Wellington Council agreed in principle to the name change, as well as replacing the Māori name with Te Herenga Waka.[22] Of the 2,000 public submissions on the name-change proposal, 75% strongly opposed it. Alumni and students strongly opposed the name change, staff gave mixed feedback, while other university stakeholders[which?] favoured the name change.[23][24] On 24 September 2018 Victoria University's Council voted by a majority of nine to two to change the university's name to the University of Wellington. The council also voted to adopt the new Māori name of Te Herenga Waka. The university's Vice-Chancellor Grant Guilford abstained from the vote, citing a conflict of interest. Critics such as Victoria University law professor Geoff McLay criticized the name change for erasing 120 years of history. By contrast, Chancellor Neil Paviour-Smith defended the outcome of the vote as ""one decision in a much broader strategy to try and help the university really achieve its potential"".[25][23] The council would submit its recommendation to the Minister of Education to make the final decision.[26][23] On 18 December 2018 the Minister for Education, Chris Hipkins, announced that he had rejected the University Council's recommendation, stating that the proposed change did not have sufficient support from Victoria's staff, students or alumni, and that such a change would not be in keeping with institution accountability or be in the national interest.[27][28] On 6 May 2019 Victoria University's Council announced that it would not contest the Education Minister's decision to reject its name-change proposal. The name change had received exceptionally strong opposition from faculty, alumni, students, and the Wellington City Council.[29][30] Governance and administration[edit] From 1938 to 1957, the head of administration was the principal. Since 1957, the head of administration has been the vice-chancellor. The following people held the role of principal and/or vice-chancellor:[31] Tommy Hunter, 1938–1951 James ""Jim"" Williams, 1951–1968 Danny Taylor, 1968–1982 Ian Axford, 1982–1985 Leslie Charles Holborow, 1986–1998 Michael Irving, 1998–2000[32] Stuart McCutcheon, 2000–2004[33] Pat Walsh, 2005–2013[34] Grant Guilford, 2013–present Campuses and facilities[edit] Victoria University of Wellington's Kelburn Campus: the Hunter Building Victoria University of Wellington's Pipitea Campus: the Faculty of Law Victoria University of Wellington's Kelburn Campus Victoria University of Wellington has three campuses spread out over Wellington city. It also has premises in Auckland. Wellington[edit] The main campus is in the suburb of Kelburn, New Zealand, overlooking the Wellington Central business district, where the Faculties of Humanities and Social Sciences, Science, Engineering, Education and Health are based. Additionally, it is the location of the university's Central Library and the site of its administrative offices. The campus has a range of amenities including cafes, the university book store VicBooks, a pharmacy and health services, childcare facilities, and a sports and recreation centre. The Victoria University of Wellington Students' Association is based here. The Pipitea campus consists of the Wellington School of Business and Government, which includes the School of Accounting and Commercial Law, School of Economics and Finance, School of Government, School of Information Management, School of Management, School of Marketing and International Business, and the Faculty of Law.[35] The Campus is located near the New Zealand Parliament Buildings, consisting of Rutherford House, the Old Government Buildings and the West Wing of the Wellington railway station. It is the location of the Commerce and Law libraries. Student services available at the Pipitea campus include Student Health and Well-being, the Recreation Centre and VicBooks. The Wellington Faculty of Architecture and Design Innovation is located in the Te Aro Campus.[36] The campus contains an Architecture and Design library. Auckland[edit] The School of Business and Government offers selected courses at the Auckland premises, which is located in the Auckland CBD. Other facilities[edit] The Victoria University Coastal Ecology Laboratory supports research programs in marine biology and coastal ecology on Wellington's rugged south coast. The Miramar Creative Centre is located by the Weta Workshop buildings on Park Road, Miramar. The centre offers access to work experience and connections with New Zealand's film, animation and game design industries. Library[edit] The library was established in 1899.[37] The collections are dispersed over four locations: Kelburn Library, Law Library, Architecture and Design Library and Commerce Library. The library also has a collection of digital resources and full text material online. In addition to electronic resources, printed books and journals, the Library also acquires works in microform, sound recordings, videos and other media consistent with the university's academic programme needs.[38] The library holds approximately 1.3 million printed volumes. It provides access to 70,000 print and electronic periodical titles and 200,000 e-books. It is an official Depository Library (DL-296) of the United Nations System (DEPOLIB), one of only three in the country. The J. C. Beaglehole Room is the official repository of all archival and manuscript material, and provides a supervised research service for Rare Books, for fine or fragile print items, and for 'last resort' copies of university publications. The New Zealand Electronic Text Centre (NZETC) is a digital library of significant New Zealand and Pacific Island texts and materials, and is arranged according to the library of Congress classification system. The library has two online repositories: the ResearchArchive is its open research repository, which makes the university's research freely available online and the RestrictedArchive, which is the university's private research repository and is accessible only to Victoria University staff and students.[39] Between April 2003 and February 2010 the library was home to two locally famous residents, Tessa Brown and Sandy Rankine, a pair of library cats.[40] Campus Developments[edit] Te Huanui and 320 The Terrace[edit] See also: Gordon Wilson Flats In September 2014, the university announced that it would purchase the abandoned Gordon Wilson Flats from Housing New Zealand.[41] It was subsequently revealed that the purchase price was over $6 million NZD.[42] The university bought the site due to its close proximity to the Kelburn campus, with the potential to create a link between Ghuznee St and the Terrace to the campus. The Gordon Wilson Flats, with Victoria University of Wellington's Kelburn Campus visible on the hill above. In July 2015, Urban Perspectives Limited, on behalf of Victoria University, lodged an application with Wellington City Council to rezone the area from ""Inner Residential Area"" to ""Institutional Precinct"", remove the Flats from the City District Plan's heritage list, and amend the Institutional Precinct provisions of the District Plan.[43] Residents supported the removal of the flats from the area, as it was a significant case of urban decay in the area, while various groups, such as the Wellington Architectural Centre opposed the demolition of the flats, noting their architectural significance. The Gordon Wilson Flats have exceptional architectural significance. Not only are they associated with F. Gordon Wilson, one of the most prominent, powerful and influential architects in New Zealand from the 1930s through to the 1950s but they are the last of a line of highly important high rise social housing projects built by the state. They were initiated by the first Labour Government of 1935 and they reflect and have a direct connection with international modernism. This issue bought up wider debate on whether it was worth retaining mid-century public housing for heritage purposes, when the building in question had itself paid scant value towards the past. In April 2016, a Wellington City Council panel approved the rezoning of the flats, allowing Victoria University to demolish the building. However, in July 2016, the Architectural Centre lodged an appeal in the Environment Court against the Wellington City Council's decision to remove the Gordon Wilson flats' heritage status under Wellington's District Plan.[44] The appeal was successful with the court determining that the heritage listing should stand in August 2017.[44] in 2018, Victoria University students Jessie Rogers and Hannah Rushton mapped the building using LIDAR mapping technology.[45] This data was then used to create a computer generated model of the flats, allowing for them to be explored in a virtual reality environment. This virtual reality experience was them displayed at an exhibition named Immersive Legacies: 320 The Terrace, at the Wellington Museum, allowing for users to see information about the building, the building in its prime state, and the current deterioration of the structure[46]. In July 2020, Victoria University unveiled plans for what they called 'Te Huanui'.[47] The plan showed that the university could be rezoning the site for institutional use, demolishing the Gordon Wilson Flats, while retaining the nearby McLeans Flats. The area would then be used to create a gateway between the hilltop Kelburn campus, and the city below, including an outdoor plaza and new teaching and research facilities. The development would also create a pedestrian and elevator link up to the Kelburn campus.[48] Renovation work commencing on Wellington Town Hall. National Centre for Music[edit] See also: New Zealand School of Music In 2019, Victoria University, on behalf of the New Zealand School of Music, signed an agreement with Wellington City Council and the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra to establish a new National Music Centre based in Wellington Town Hall.[49] This would be established once refurbishment work on the town hall had been completed. Victoria University vice-chancellor Grant Guilford believed the national music centre would provide a real uplift for music and music education. The state-of-the-art teaching, rehearsal, research and performance spaces that it will offer will enable an outstanding education for the next generation of musicians The Living Pā[edit] The Living Pa will be a redevelopment of the marae and surrounding area of the Kelburn campus.[50] This will involve the removal of five buildings from 42 to 50 Kelburn Parade and the creation of a new building employing principles based on the Living Building Challenge. Preparation work began in mid 2021, starting with the clearance and demolition of existing buildings on the construction site. Organisation and administration[edit] Day-to-day governance is in the hands of the University Council, which consists of 20 people: four elected by the Court of Convocation, three elected by the academic staff, one elected by the general staff, two appointed by the student union executive, four appointed by the Minister of Education, four selected by the Council itself, and the Vice-Chancellor. The Court of Convocation is composed of all graduates who choose to participate. Charles Wilson, at the time the chief librarian of the parliamentary library, was a member of the original council and its chairman for two years.[51] For New Zealand residents entry to most courses is open, with a few exceptions. Performance Music requires an audition. There is selection for entry into the second year in degrees such as the LLB, BArch and BDes. BA in criminology and creative writing is also based on selection. It is one of only three institutions (University of Auckland and Unitec being the others) to offer a degree in architecture in New Zealand. It owns the New Zealand School of Music. Faculties[edit] Faculty of Law on the left, Houses of Parliament on the right.The faculties are: Wellington Faculty of Architecture and Design Innovation[52] Wellington School of Business and Government[53] Wellington Faculty of Education[54] Wellington Faculty of Engineering[55] Wellington Faculty of Graduate Research[56] Wellington Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences[57] Faculty of Law[58] Wellington Faculty of Science[59] Wellington Faculty of Health[60] Faculty of Law[edit] The Faculty of Law is located in the restored Old Government Buildings at the centre of the country's law-making precinct, in close proximity to Parliament, the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal, and the District and High courts. The Faculty is rated 65th in the world in the 2021 QS World University Rankings[61] and led New Zealand's law faculties for research in the most recent Performance-Based Research Fund Evaluation in 2006.[62] Academic profile[edit] University rankingsGlobal – OverallARWU World[63]401-500 (2020)CWUR World[64]657 (2019-2020)QS World[65]223 (2021)THE World[66]501–600 (2021) National – OverallARWU National[67]3-4 (2020)CWUR National[68]5 (2018-2019) Academic rankings[edit] World University Rankings Year QS World University Rankings[69] Academic Ranking of World Universities[70] Times Higher Education World University Rankings[71] 2020 215 301–400 501–600 2019 221 301–400 401–500 2018 219 301–400 401–500 2017 228 301–400 351–400 2016 229 301–400 351–400 2015 275 276–300 Research centres and institutes[edit] Victoria University Coastal Ecology Laboratory Victoria has more than 40 research centres and institutes, including MacDiarmid Institute for Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology Robinson Research Institute[72] Ferrier Research Institute Malaghan Institute of Medical Research Victoria University Coastal Ecology Laboratory Centre for Strategic Studies New Zealand Language Learning Centre Adam Art Gallery New Zealand Electronic Text Centre Antarctic Research Centre To see more, browse an A-Z List of Research Centres and Institutes[73] Student life[edit] Offices of the Victoria University of Wellington Students' Association.

In April 2020, during the COVID-19 outbreak, the university came under fire from students, politicians, and media for suddenly announcing at 48 hours notice that they would be charging students a ""placeholder fee"" ($150 per week) for student accommodation that they had been forcibly removed from, despite emails from the university previously telling those same students that they would not have to pay.[86][87][88] Notable academics and staff[edit] Main category: Victoria University of Wellington faculty James Belich, historian Doreen Blumhardt, education academic Jonathan Boston, public policy academic Mai Chen, public law lawyer Paul Callaghan, physical sciences academic Margaret Clark, political science academic Sally Davenport, management academic Lloyd Geering, religious studies academic Robert Walker Hay FRSE, chemist Frank Holmes, economics academic George Edward Hughes, philosophy academic Joanna Kidman, sociologist Allison Kirkman, sociologist Wendy Larner, social scientist, Provost Douglas Lilburn, music academic Richard Cockburn Maclaurin, mathematics academic Bill Manhire, author and poet Douglas Mews, academic and early keyboard specialist Paul Morris, religious studies academic Peter Munz, history academic Terence O'Brien, diplomat and academic Tipene O'Regan, Māori leader and education academic Vincent O'Sullivan, academic and poet Geoffrey Palmer, politician Matthew Palmer, law academic Pat Ralph, marine biologist; first woman at Victoria to be awarded a DSc[89] Prof. James Renwick, climate scientist and science communicator Ivor Richardson, lawyer and academic Claudia Scott, public policy academic Kim Sterelny, philosophy academic Teresia Teaiwa, Pacific studies academic, author, poet Matt Visser, specialist in general relativity Colleen Ward, cross-cultural psychologist academic Colin J.

It was established in 1897 by Act of Parliament, and was a constituent college of the University of New Zealand. The university is well known for its programmes in law, the humanities, and some scientific disciplines, and offers a broad range of other courses. Entry to all courses at first year is open, and entry to second year in some programmes (e.g. law, criminology, creative writing, architecture, engineering[8]) is restricted. Victoria had the highest average research grade in the New Zealand Government's Performance-Based Research Fund exercise in both 2012 and 2018, having been ranked 4th in 2006 and 3rd in 2003.[9] Victoria has been ranked 215th in the World's Top 500 universities by the QS World University Rankings (2020).[6] Contents 1 History 1.1 Early History and Colonial Politics 1.2 Establishment 1.3 Founding Professors 1.4 Early days 1.5 Kelburn Campus 1.6 Development 1.7 Name-change proposal 2 Governance and administration 3 Campuses and facilities 3.1 Wellington 3.2 Auckland 3.3 Other facilities 3.4 Library 3.5 Campus Developments 3.5.1 Te Huanui and 320 The Terrace 3.5.2 National Centre for Music 3.5.3 The Living Pā 4 Organisation and administration 4.1 Faculties 4.1.1 Faculty of Law 5 Academic profile 5.1 Academic rankings 6 Research centres and institutes 7 Student life 7.1 Students' associations and student media 7.2 Halls of residence 8 Controversies 9 Notable academics and staff 10 Notable alumni 11 See also 12 References 13 External links History[edit] Victoria University of Wellington (originally known as Victoria University College) was founded in 1897, named after Queen Victoria, on the 60th anniversary of her coronation.[10] The original name was Victoria University College, but on the dissolution of the University of New Zealand in 1961 Victoria or ""Vic"" became the Victoria University of Wellington, conferring its own degrees. Early History and Colonial Politics[edit] In 1868, the colonial government of New Zealand passed the University Endowment Act of 1868, which established scholarship programs for study in the home islands of Great Britain, in addition to setting aside a land endowment in the burgeoning colony itself. The following year, with wealth generated from the Otago Gold Rush in addition to a strong foundation of the Scottish Enlightenment, the provincial government of Otago proceeded to lay the groundwork to establish the University of Otago. This was followed by the creation of Canterbury College, associated with the newly formed University of New Zealand. Robert Stout 'The Father of Victoria College' In 1878, a royal commission was appointed to review the state of higher education in the country. It recommended the establishment of a federal system of four university colleges, established in Auckland and Wellington, in addition to the integration of the University of Otago and Canterbury College. The colonial government moved to provide sites, statutory grants and land endowments. This was somewhat delayed after the state of recession caused by the collapse of the City of Glasgow Bank in the same year, leading to a contraction in credit from Great Britain, and specifically London, the centre of global finance at the time. Nevertheless, in 1882, parliament passed the Auckland University College Act in 1882. The growth of the population of Wellington, and the gradual improvement of the economy in the late 1880s were key factors in the final establishment of the college. A prominent advocate of creation was Robert Stout, Premier of New Zealand and later Chief Justice, as well as a member of the university senate. In June 1886, as Minister of Education, Stout signalled the governments intent of introducing a bill to establish a centre for higher learning in Wellington. Being the centre of the colonial government, Stout cited the opportunity for the college to be able to particularly specialize in law, political science, and history. Stout further suggested that the staff of the New Zealand Colonial Museum could provide services in the fields of geology and natural history. This was indicated in the Wellington University College Bill of 1887, which meant the effective annexation of the museum. Colonial Museum director James Hector voiced considerable opposition to this bill. After a lengthy debate in parliament, this bill was promptly defeated. Establishment[edit] In 1897, the current premier, Richard Seddon, who had until this point been unsupportive of the university project, returned from Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee celebrations in Great Britain with an honorary Law degree from the University of Cambridge. Seddon decided that the establishment of a college in Wellington would be a suitable way to mark the Queen's jubilee year. When introducing the Victoria College Bill in December 1897, Seddon stated: ‘I do not think there will be any question as to the necessity for the establishment of a University College here in Wellington,’ The college was to be governed by a 16-man council, with their inaugural meeting taking place on the 23rd of May 1898. Founding Professors[edit] The founding professors of Victoria college were: John Rankine Brown[11] - Professor of Classics Hugh Mackenzie - Professor of English language and Literature Thomas Hill Easterfield[12] - Professor of Chemistry and Physics Richard Cockburn Maclaurin[13] - Professor of Mathematics Wellington Girls High School building situated on the right, where early classes were held. Early days[edit] While Victoria College had been legally founded, a grand, a council and a number of students, it had no physical property for the first decade of its existence. Early courses were held at Wellington Girls High School as well as the Technical School building on Victoria Street.[10] The professors set about creating a unique identity for the college. The somewhat fitting motto ""Sapientia magis auro desideranda"" was adopted in 1902. In 1903, the college adopted a badge and coat of arms featuring three crowns, the stars of the southern cross and the crest of the namesake of Wellington. It was at this time that the colours of the college were chosen; dark green and gold, taking inspiration of the colours of the nearby gorse covered Tinakori Hill. In 1903 the council intended to establish a professorship in law, ‘with a desire of to making the Law School at Wellington the most complete in the Colony’, as soon as financially possible. The college appointed a fifth professor, in modern languages - selecting the Oxford educated Anglo-German George von Zedlitz. Zelditz was joined by a newly appointed New Zealand-educated biology professor Harry Borrer Kirk. The 1903 plan for the University Campus at Kelburn[14] Kelburn Campus[edit] The Hunter BuildingThe newly appointed Council in 1889 had considered the use of the 13-acre Alexandra Barracks site for a permanent campus. The site was widely supported in Wellington, but release of the land for academic purposes was stalled by the Seddon Government.[15] In February 1901 an offer was made by a wealthy Wairarapa sheep farmer named Charles Pharazyn. Pharazyn offered to donate £1000 if the college was built on a 6-acre plot of hilly land in Kelburn. Coincidentally, Pharazyn held a major financial interest in the then-under construction Kelburn - Karori Tramway (now known as the Wellington Cable Car). The Tramway was completed the following year, and to this day transports students from the central business area of Lambton Quay, to the university via Salamanca Station.[16] Construction began in 1902, with the regrading of the hillside, with the construction of a main building following shortly after, designed by local architects F. Penty and E.M. Blake in the Gothic Revival style. At the requests of Richard Seddon, the building gained a more imposing demeanor through the insistence of adding a third level. The then governor of New Zealand, Lord Plunket, laid the foundation stone on the 27th of August 1904. While opened on the 30th of March 1906, the building was not completed to its original design, but was progressively added to as the college grew. In the meantime, students had built tennis courts, as well as a wooden gymnasium and social hall being constructed. The building was named after Thomas Alexander Hunter, the well-regarded professor of mental science and political economy. Following the end of the First World War, north and south wings were added to the building, providing new teaching areas, recreational spaces, and a new library. Development[edit] An extramural branch was founded at Palmerston North in 1960. It merged with Massey College on 1 January 1963. Having become a branch of Victoria upon the University of New Zealand's 1961 demise, the merged college became Massey University on 1 January 1964.[17] In 2004, Victoria celebrated the 100th birthday of its first home, the Hunter Building. Victoria has expanded beyond its original campus in Kelburn, with campuses in Te Aro (Faculty of Architecture and Design), and Pipitea (opposite Parliament, housing the Faculty of Law and Victoria Business School). Victoria also hosts the Ferrier Research Institute and the Robinson Research Institute in Lower Hutt, the Coastal Ecology Laboratory in Island Bay and the Miramar Creative Centre, in Park Rd, Miramar. In 2015, Victoria opened a new campus in Auckland to service the growing demand for its courses and expertise.[18] Name-change proposal[edit] The Te Toki a Rata building was completed in 2017, and houses the School of Biological Sciences In May 2018 it was reported that Victoria was exploring options to simplify its name to University of Wellington[19] (as distinct from Wellington University in Fort Collins, Colorado and other entities).[20] Vice-Chancellor Grant Guillford said that the university was pursuing a name change in order to reduce confusion overseas, as several other universities also carried the ""Victoria"" name.[21] On 27 July 2018, the Victoria University of Wellington Council agreed in principle to the name change, as well as replacing the Māori name with Te Herenga Waka.[22] Of the 2,000 public submissions on the name-change proposal, 75% strongly opposed it. Alumni and students strongly opposed the name change, staff gave mixed feedback, while other university stakeholders[which?] favoured the name change.[23][24] On 24 September 2018 Victoria University's Council voted by a majority of nine to two to change the university's name to the University of Wellington. The council also voted to adopt the new Māori name of Te Herenga Waka. The university's Vice-Chancellor Grant Guilford abstained from the vote, citing a conflict of interest. Critics such as Victoria University law professor Geoff McLay criticized the name change for erasing 120 years of history. By contrast, Chancellor Neil Paviour-Smith defended the outcome of the vote as ""one decision in a much broader strategy to try and help the university really achieve its potential"".[25][23] The council would submit its recommendation to the Minister of Education to make the final decision.[26][23] On 18 December 2018 the Minister for Education, Chris Hipkins, announced that he had rejected the University Council's recommendation, stating that the proposed change did not have sufficient support from Victoria's staff, students or alumni, and that such a change would not be in keeping with institution accountability or be in the national interest.[27][28] On 6 May 2019 Victoria University's Council announced that it would not contest the Education Minister's decision to reject its name-change proposal. The name change had received exceptionally strong opposition from faculty, alumni, students, and the Wellington City Council.[29][30] Governance and administration[edit] From 1938 to 1957, the head of administration was the principal. Since 1957, the head of administration has been the vice-chancellor. The following people held the role of principal and/or vice-chancellor:[31] Tommy Hunter, 1938–1951 James ""Jim"" Williams, 1951–1968 Danny Taylor, 1968–1982 Ian Axford, 1982–1985 Leslie Charles Holborow, 1986–1998 Michael Irving, 1998–2000[32] Stuart McCutcheon, 2000–2004[33] Pat Walsh, 2005–2013[34] Grant Guilford, 2013–present Campuses and facilities[edit] Victoria University of Wellington's Kelburn Campus: the Hunter Building Victoria University of Wellington's Pipitea Campus: the Faculty of Law Victoria University of Wellington's Kelburn Campus Victoria University of Wellington has three campuses spread out over Wellington city. It also has premises in Auckland. Wellington[edit] The main campus is in the suburb of Kelburn, New Zealand, overlooking the Wellington Central business district, where the Faculties of Humanities and Social Sciences, Science, Engineering, Education and Health are based. Additionally, it is the location of the university's Central Library and the site of its administrative offices. The campus has a range of amenities including cafes, the university book store VicBooks, a pharmacy and health services, childcare facilities, and a sports and recreation centre. The Victoria University of Wellington Students' Association is based here. The Pipitea campus consists of the Wellington School of Business and Government, which includes the School of Accounting and Commercial Law, School of Economics and Finance, School of Government, School of Information Management, School of Management, School of Marketing and International Business, and the Faculty of Law.[35] The Campus is located near the New Zealand Parliament Buildings, consisting of Rutherford House, the Old Government Buildings and the West Wing of the Wellington railway station. It is the location of the Commerce and Law libraries. Student services available at the Pipitea campus include Student Health and Well-being, the Recreation Centre and VicBooks. The Wellington Faculty of Architecture and Design Innovation is located in the Te Aro Campus.[36] The campus contains an Architecture and Design library. Auckland[edit] The School of Business and Government offers selected courses at the Auckland premises, which is located in the Auckland CBD. Other facilities[edit] The Victoria University Coastal Ecology Laboratory supports research programs in marine biology and coastal ecology on Wellington's rugged south coast. The Miramar Creative Centre is located by the Weta Workshop buildings on Park Road, Miramar. The centre offers access to work experience and connections with New Zealand's film, animation and game design industries. Library[edit] The library was established in 1899.[37] The collections are dispersed over four locations: Kelburn Library, Law Library, Architecture and Design Library and Commerce Library. The library also has a collection of digital resources and full text material online. In addition to electronic resources, printed books and journals, the Library also acquires works in microform, sound recordings, videos and other media consistent with the university's academic programme needs.[38] The library holds approximately 1.3 million printed volumes. It provides access to 70,000 print and electronic periodical titles and 200,000 e-books. It is an official Depository Library (DL-296) of the United Nations System (DEPOLIB), one of only three in the country. The J. C. Beaglehole Room is the official repository of all archival and manuscript material, and provides a supervised research service for Rare Books, for fine or fragile print items, and for 'last resort' copies of university publications. The New Zealand Electronic Text Centre (NZETC) is a digital library of significant New Zealand and Pacific Island texts and materials, and is arranged according to the library of Congress classification system. The library has two online repositories: the ResearchArchive is its open research repository, which makes the university's research freely available online and the RestrictedArchive, which is the university's private research repository and is accessible only to Victoria University staff and students.[39] Between April 2003 and February 2010 the library was home to two locally famous residents, Tessa Brown and Sandy Rankine, a pair of library cats.[40] Campus Developments[edit] Te Huanui and 320 The Terrace[edit] See also: Gordon Wilson Flats In September 2014, the university announced that it would purchase the abandoned Gordon Wilson Flats from Housing New Zealand.[41] It was subsequently revealed that the purchase price was over $6 million NZD.[42] The university bought the site due to its close proximity to the Kelburn campus, with the potential to create a link between Ghuznee St and the Terrace to the campus. The Gordon Wilson Flats, with Victoria University of Wellington's Kelburn Campus visible on the hill above. In July 2015, Urban Perspectives Limited, on behalf of Victoria University, lodged an application with Wellington City Council to rezone the area from ""Inner Residential Area"" to ""Institutional Precinct"", remove the Flats from the City District Plan's heritage list, and amend the Institutional Precinct provisions of the District Plan.[43] Residents supported the removal of the flats from the area, as it was a significant case of urban decay in the area, while various groups, such as the Wellington Architectural Centre opposed the demolition of the flats, noting their architectural significance. The Gordon Wilson Flats have exceptional architectural significance. Not only are they associated with F. Gordon Wilson, one of the most prominent, powerful and influential architects in New Zealand from the 1930s through to the 1950s but they are the last of a line of highly important high rise social housing projects built by the state. They were initiated by the first Labour Government of 1935 and they reflect and have a direct connection with international modernism. This issue bought up wider debate on whether it was worth retaining mid-century public housing for heritage purposes, when the building in question had itself paid scant value towards the past. In April 2016, a Wellington City Council panel approved the rezoning of the flats, allowing Victoria University to demolish the building. However, in July 2016, the Architectural Centre lodged an appeal in the Environment Court against the Wellington City Council's decision to remove the Gordon Wilson flats' heritage status under Wellington's District Plan.[44] The appeal was successful with the court determining that the heritage listing should stand in August 2017.[44] in 2018, Victoria University students Jessie Rogers and Hannah Rushton mapped the building using LIDAR mapping technology.[45] This data was then used to create a computer generated model of the flats, allowing for them to be explored in a virtual reality environment. This virtual reality experience was them displayed at an exhibition named Immersive Legacies: 320 The Terrace, at the Wellington Museum, allowing for users to see information about the building, the building in its prime state, and the current deterioration of the structure[46]. In July 2020, Victoria University unveiled plans for what they called 'Te Huanui'.[47] The plan showed that the university could be rezoning the site for institutional use, demolishing the Gordon Wilson Flats, while retaining the nearby McLeans Flats. The area would then be used to create a gateway between the hilltop Kelburn campus, and the city below, including an outdoor plaza and new teaching and research facilities. The development would also create a pedestrian and elevator link up to the Kelburn campus.[48] Renovation work commencing on Wellington Town Hall. National Centre for Music[edit] See also: New Zealand School of Music In 2019, Victoria University, on behalf of the New Zealand School of Music, signed an agreement with Wellington City Council and the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra to establish a new National Music Centre based in Wellington Town Hall.[49] This would be established once refurbishment work on the town hall had been completed. Victoria University vice-chancellor Grant Guilford believed the national music centre would provide a real uplift for music and music education. The state-of-the-art teaching, rehearsal, research and performance spaces that it will offer will enable an outstanding education for the next generation of musicians The Living Pā[edit] The Living Pa will be a redevelopment of the marae and surrounding area of the Kelburn campus.[50] This will involve the removal of five buildings from 42 to 50 Kelburn Parade and the creation of a new building employing principles based on the Living Building Challenge. Preparation work began in mid 2021, starting with the clearance and demolition of existing buildings on the construction site. Organisation and administration[edit] Day-to-day governance is in the hands of the University Council, which consists of 20 people: four elected by the Court of Convocation, three elected by the academic staff, one elected by the general staff, two appointed by the student union executive, four appointed by the Minister of Education, four selected by the Council itself, and the Vice-Chancellor. The Court of Convocation is composed of all graduates who choose to participate. Charles Wilson, at the time the chief librarian of the parliamentary library, was a member of the original council and its chairman for two years.[51] For New Zealand residents entry to most courses is open, with a few exceptions. Performance Music requires an audition. There is selection for entry into the second year in degrees such as the LLB, BArch and BDes. BA in criminology and creative writing is also based on selection. It is one of only three institutions (University of Auckland and Unitec being the others) to offer a degree in architecture in New Zealand. It owns the New Zealand School of Music.

In April 2020, during the COVID-19 outbreak, the university came under fire from students, politicians, and media for suddenly announcing at 48 hours notice that they would be charging students a ""placeholder fee"" ($150 per week) for student accommodation that they had been forcibly removed from, despite emails from the university previously telling those same students that they would not have to pay.[86][87][88] Notable academics and staff[edit] Main category: Victoria University of Wellington faculty James Belich, historian Doreen Blumhardt, education academic Jonathan Boston, public policy academic Mai Chen, public law lawyer Paul Callaghan, physical sciences academic Margaret Clark, political science academic Sally Davenport, management academic Lloyd Geering, religious studies academic Robert Walker Hay FRSE, chemist Frank Holmes, economics academic George Edward Hughes, philosophy academic Joanna Kidman, sociologist Allison Kirkman, sociologist Wendy Larner, social scientist, Provost Douglas Lilburn, music academic Richard Cockburn Maclaurin, mathematics academic Bill Manhire, author and poet Douglas Mews, academic and early keyboard specialist Paul Morris, religious studies academic Peter Munz, history academic Terence O'Brien, diplomat and academic Tipene O'Regan, Māori leader and education academic Vincent O'Sullivan, academic and poet Geoffrey Palmer, politician Matthew Palmer, law academic Pat Ralph, marine biologist; first woman at Victoria to be awarded a DSc[89] Prof. James Renwick, climate scientist and science communicator Ivor Richardson, lawyer and academic Claudia Scott, public policy academic Kim Sterelny, philosophy academic Teresia Teaiwa, Pacific studies academic, author, poet Matt Visser, specialist in general relativity Colleen Ward, cross-cultural psychologist academic Colin J.

It was established in 1897 by Act of Parliament, and was a constituent college of the University of New Zealand. The university is well known for its programmes in law, the humanities, and some scientific disciplines, and offers a broad range of other courses. Entry to all courses at first year is open, and entry to second year in some programmes (e.g. law, criminology, creative writing, architecture, engineering[8]) is restricted. Victoria had the highest average research grade in the New Zealand Government's Performance-Based Research Fund exercise in both 2012 and 2018, having been ranked 4th in 2006 and 3rd in 2003.[9] Victoria has been ranked 215th in the World's Top 500 universities by the QS World University Rankings (2020).[6] Contents 1 History 1.1 Early History and Colonial Politics 1.2 Establishment 1.3 Founding Professors 1.4 Early days 1.5 Kelburn Campus 1.6 Development 1.7 Name-change proposal 2 Governance and administration 3 Campuses and facilities 3.1 Wellington 3.2 Auckland 3.3 Other facilities 3.4 Library 3.5 Campus Developments 3.5.1 Te Huanui and 320 The Terrace 3.5.2 National Centre for Music 3.5.3 The Living Pā 4 Organisation and administration 4.1 Faculties 4.1.1 Faculty of Law 5 Academic profile 5.1 Academic rankings 6 Research centres and institutes 7 Student life 7.1 Students' associations and student media 7.2 Halls of residence 8 Controversies 9 Notable academics and staff 10 Notable alumni 11 See also 12 References 13 External links History[edit] Victoria University of Wellington (originally known as Victoria University College) was founded in 1897, named after Queen Victoria, on the 60th anniversary of her coronation.[10] The original name was Victoria University College, but on the dissolution of the University of New Zealand in 1961 Victoria or ""Vic"" became the Victoria University of Wellington, conferring its own degrees. Early History and Colonial Politics[edit] In 1868, the colonial government of New Zealand passed the University Endowment Act of 1868, which established scholarship programs for study in the home islands of Great Britain, in addition to setting aside a land endowment in the burgeoning colony itself. The following year, with wealth generated from the Otago Gold Rush in addition to a strong foundation of the Scottish Enlightenment, the provincial government of Otago proceeded to lay the groundwork to establish the University of Otago. This was followed by the creation of Canterbury College, associated with the newly formed University of New Zealand. Robert Stout 'The Father of Victoria College' In 1878, a royal commission was appointed to review the state of higher education in the country. It recommended the establishment of a federal system of four university colleges, established in Auckland and Wellington, in addition to the integration of the University of Otago and Canterbury College. The colonial government moved to provide sites, statutory grants and land endowments. This was somewhat delayed after the state of recession caused by the collapse of the City of Glasgow Bank in the same year, leading to a contraction in credit from Great Britain, and specifically London, the centre of global finance at the time. Nevertheless, in 1882, parliament passed the Auckland University College Act in 1882. The growth of the population of Wellington, and the gradual improvement of the economy in the late 1880s were key factors in the final establishment of the college. A prominent advocate of creation was Robert Stout, Premier of New Zealand and later Chief Justice, as well as a member of the university senate. In June 1886, as Minister of Education, Stout signalled the governments intent of introducing a bill to establish a centre for higher learning in Wellington. Being the centre of the colonial government, Stout cited the opportunity for the college to be able to particularly specialize in law, political science, and history. Stout further suggested that the staff of the New Zealand Colonial Museum could provide services in the fields of geology and natural history. This was indicated in the Wellington University College Bill of 1887, which meant the effective annexation of the museum. Colonial Museum director James Hector voiced considerable opposition to this bill. After a lengthy debate in parliament, this bill was promptly defeated. Establishment[edit] In 1897, the current premier, Richard Seddon, who had until this point been unsupportive of the university project, returned from Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee celebrations in Great Britain with an honorary Law degree from the University of Cambridge. Seddon decided that the establishment of a college in Wellington would be a suitable way to mark the Queen's jubilee year. When introducing the Victoria College Bill in December 1897, Seddon stated: ‘I do not think there will be any question as to the necessity for the establishment of a University College here in Wellington,’ The college was to be governed by a 16-man council, with their inaugural meeting taking place on the 23rd of May 1898. Founding Professors[edit] The founding professors of Victoria college were: John Rankine Brown[11] - Professor of Classics Hugh Mackenzie - Professor of English language and Literature Thomas Hill Easterfield[12] - Professor of Chemistry and Physics Richard Cockburn Maclaurin[13] - Professor of Mathematics Wellington Girls High School building situated on the right, where early classes were held. Early days[edit] While Victoria College had been legally founded, a grand, a council and a number of students, it had no physical property for the first decade of its existence. Early courses were held at Wellington Girls High School as well as the Technical School building on Victoria Street.[10] The professors set about creating a unique identity for the college. The somewhat fitting motto ""Sapientia magis auro desideranda"" was adopted in 1902. In 1903, the college adopted a badge and coat of arms featuring three crowns, the stars of the southern cross and the crest of the namesake of Wellington. It was at this time that the colours of the college were chosen; dark green and gold, taking inspiration of the colours of the nearby gorse covered Tinakori Hill. In 1903 the council intended to establish a professorship in law, ‘with a desire of to making the Law School at Wellington the most complete in the Colony’, as soon as financially possible. The college appointed a fifth professor, in modern languages - selecting the Oxford educated Anglo-German George von Zedlitz. Zelditz was joined by a newly appointed New Zealand-educated biology professor Harry Borrer Kirk. The 1903 plan for the University Campus at Kelburn[14] Kelburn Campus[edit] The Hunter BuildingThe newly appointed Council in 1889 had considered the use of the 13-acre Alexandra Barracks site for a permanent campus. The site was widely supported in Wellington, but release of the land for academic purposes was stalled by the Seddon Government.[15] In February 1901 an offer was made by a wealthy Wairarapa sheep farmer named Charles Pharazyn. Pharazyn offered to donate £1000 if the college was built on a 6-acre plot of hilly land in Kelburn. Coincidentally, Pharazyn held a major financial interest in the then-under construction Kelburn - Karori Tramway (now known as the Wellington Cable Car). The Tramway was completed the following year, and to this day transports students from the central business area of Lambton Quay, to the university via Salamanca Station.[16] Construction began in 1902, with the regrading of the hillside, with the construction of a main building following shortly after, designed by local architects F. Penty and E.M. Blake in the Gothic Revival style. At the requests of Richard Seddon, the building gained a more imposing demeanor through the insistence of adding a third level. The then governor of New Zealand, Lord Plunket, laid the foundation stone on the 27th of August 1904. While opened on the 30th of March 1906, the building was not completed to its original design, but was progressively added to as the college grew. In the meantime, students had built tennis courts, as well as a wooden gymnasium and social hall being constructed. The building was named after Thomas Alexander Hunter, the well-regarded professor of mental science and political economy. Following the end of the First World War, north and south wings were added to the building, providing new teaching areas, recreational spaces, and a new library. Development[edit] An extramural branch was founded at Palmerston North in 1960. It merged with Massey College on 1 January 1963. Having become a branch of Victoria upon the University of New Zealand's 1961 demise, the merged college became Massey University on 1 January 1964.[17] In 2004, Victoria celebrated the 100th birthday of its first home, the Hunter Building. Victoria has expanded beyond its original campus in Kelburn, with campuses in Te Aro (Faculty of Architecture and Design), and Pipitea (opposite Parliament, housing the Faculty of Law and Victoria Business School). Victoria also hosts the Ferrier Research Institute and the Robinson Research Institute in Lower Hutt, the Coastal Ecology Laboratory in Island Bay and the Miramar Creative Centre, in Park Rd, Miramar. In 2015, Victoria opened a new campus in Auckland to service the growing demand for its courses and expertise.[18] Name-change proposal[edit] The Te Toki a Rata building was completed in 2017, and houses the School of Biological Sciences In May 2018 it was reported that Victoria was exploring options to simplify its name to University of Wellington[19] (as distinct from Wellington University in Fort Collins, Colorado and other entities).[20] Vice-Chancellor Grant Guillford said that the university was pursuing a name change in order to reduce confusion overseas, as several other universities also carried the ""Victoria"" name.[21] On 27 July 2018, the Victoria University of Wellington Council agreed in principle to the name change, as well as replacing the Māori name with Te Herenga Waka.[22] Of the 2,000 public submissions on the name-change proposal, 75% strongly opposed it. Alumni and students strongly opposed the name change, staff gave mixed feedback, while other university stakeholders[which?] favoured the name change.[23][24] On 24 September 2018 Victoria University's Council voted by a majority of nine to two to change the university's name to the University of Wellington. The council also voted to adopt the new Māori name of Te Herenga Waka. The university's Vice-Chancellor Grant Guilford abstained from the vote, citing a conflict of interest. Critics such as Victoria University law professor Geoff McLay criticized the name change for erasing 120 years of history. By contrast, Chancellor Neil Paviour-Smith defended the outcome of the vote as ""one decision in a much broader strategy to try and help the university really achieve its potential"".[25][23] The council would submit its recommendation to the Minister of Education to make the final decision.[26][23] On 18 December 2018 the Minister for Education, Chris Hipkins, announced that he had rejected the University Council's recommendation, stating that the proposed change did not have sufficient support from Victoria's staff, students or alumni, and that such a change would not be in keeping with institution accountability or be in the national interest.[27][28] On 6 May 2019 Victoria University's Council announced that it would not contest the Education Minister's decision to reject its name-change proposal. The name change had received exceptionally strong opposition from faculty, alumni, students, and the Wellington City Council.[29][30] Governance and administration[edit] From 1938 to 1957, the head of administration was the principal. Since 1957, the head of administration has been the vice-chancellor. The following people held the role of principal and/or vice-chancellor:[31] Tommy Hunter, 1938–1951 James ""Jim"" Williams, 1951–1968 Danny Taylor, 1968–1982 Ian Axford, 1982–1985 Leslie Charles Holborow, 1986–1998 Michael Irving, 1998–2000[32] Stuart McCutcheon, 2000–2004[33] Pat Walsh, 2005–2013[34] Grant Guilford, 2013–present Campuses and facilities[edit] Victoria University of Wellington's Kelburn Campus: the Hunter Building Victoria University of Wellington's Pipitea Campus: the Faculty of Law Victoria University of Wellington's Kelburn Campus Victoria University of Wellington has three campuses spread out over Wellington city. It also has premises in Auckland. Wellington[edit] The main campus is in the suburb of Kelburn, New Zealand, overlooking the Wellington Central business district, where the Faculties of Humanities and Social Sciences, Science, Engineering, Education and Health are based. Additionally, it is the location of the university's Central Library and the site of its administrative offices. The campus has a range of amenities including cafes, the university book store VicBooks, a pharmacy and health services, childcare facilities, and a sports and recreation centre. The Victoria University of Wellington Students' Association is based here. The Pipitea campus consists of the Wellington School of Business and Government, which includes the School of Accounting and Commercial Law, School of Economics and Finance, School of Government, School of Information Management, School of Management, School of Marketing and International Business, and the Faculty of Law.[35] The Campus is located near the New Zealand Parliament Buildings, consisting of Rutherford House, the Old Government Buildings and the West Wing of the Wellington railway station. It is the location of the Commerce and Law libraries. Student services available at the Pipitea campus include Student Health and Well-being, the Recreation Centre and VicBooks. The Wellington Faculty of Architecture and Design Innovation is located in the Te Aro Campus.[36] The campus contains an Architecture and Design library. Auckland[edit] The School of Business and Government offers selected courses at the Auckland premises, which is located in the Auckland CBD. Other facilities[edit] The Victoria University Coastal Ecology Laboratory supports research programs in marine biology and coastal ecology on Wellington's rugged south coast. The Miramar Creative Centre is located by the Weta Workshop buildings on Park Road, Miramar. The centre offers access to work experience and connections with New Zealand's film, animation and game design industries. Library[edit] The library was established in 1899.[37] The collections are dispersed over four locations: Kelburn Library, Law Library, Architecture and Design Library and Commerce Library. The library also has a collection of digital resources and full text material online. In addition to electronic resources, printed books and journals, the Library also acquires works in microform, sound recordings, videos and other media consistent with the university's academic programme needs.[38] The library holds approximately 1.3 million printed volumes. It provides access to 70,000 print and electronic periodical titles and 200,000 e-books. It is an official Depository Library (DL-296) of the United Nations System (DEPOLIB), one of only three in the country. The J. C. Beaglehole Room is the official repository of all archival and manuscript material, and provides a supervised research service for Rare Books, for fine or fragile print items, and for 'last resort' copies of university publications. The New Zealand Electronic Text Centre (NZETC) is a digital library of significant New Zealand and Pacific Island texts and materials, and is arranged according to the library of Congress classification system. The library has two online repositories: the ResearchArchive is its open research repository, which makes the university's research freely available online and the RestrictedArchive, which is the university's private research repository and is accessible only to Victoria University staff and students.[39] Between April 2003 and February 2010 the library was home to two locally famous residents, Tessa Brown and Sandy Rankine, a pair of library cats.[40] Campus Developments[edit] Te Huanui and 320 The Terrace[edit] See also: Gordon Wilson Flats In September 2014, the university announced that it would purchase the abandoned Gordon Wilson Flats from Housing New Zealand.[41] It was subsequently revealed that the purchase price was over $6 million NZD.[42] The university bought the site due to its close proximity to the Kelburn campus, with the potential to create a link between Ghuznee St and the Terrace to the campus. The Gordon Wilson Flats, with Victoria University of Wellington's Kelburn Campus visible on the hill above. In July 2015, Urban Perspectives Limited, on behalf of Victoria University, lodged an application with Wellington City Council to rezone the area from ""Inner Residential Area"" to ""Institutional Precinct"", remove the Flats from the City District Plan's heritage list, and amend the Institutional Precinct provisions of the District Plan.[43] Residents supported the removal of the flats from the area, as it was a significant case of urban decay in the area, while various groups, such as the Wellington Architectural Centre opposed the demolition of the flats, noting their architectural significance. The Gordon Wilson Flats have exceptional architectural significance. Not only are they associated with F. Gordon Wilson, one of the most prominent, powerful and influential architects in New Zealand from the 1930s through to the 1950s but they are the last of a line of highly important high rise social housing projects built by the state. They were initiated by the first Labour Government of 1935 and they reflect and have a direct connection with international modernism. This issue bought up wider debate on whether it was worth retaining mid-century public housing for heritage purposes, when the building in question had itself paid scant value towards the past. In April 2016, a Wellington City Council panel approved the rezoning of the flats, allowing Victoria University to demolish the building. However, in July 2016, the Architectural Centre lodged an appeal in the Environment Court against the Wellington City Council's decision to remove the Gordon Wilson flats' heritage status under Wellington's District Plan.[44] The appeal was successful with the court determining that the heritage listing should stand in August 2017.[44] in 2018, Victoria University students Jessie Rogers and Hannah Rushton mapped the building using LIDAR mapping technology.[45] This data was then used to create a computer generated model of the flats, allowing for them to be explored in a virtual reality environment. This virtual reality experience was them displayed at an exhibition named Immersive Legacies: 320 The Terrace, at the Wellington Museum, allowing for users to see information about the building, the building in its prime state, and the current deterioration of the structure[46]. In July 2020, Victoria University unveiled plans for what they called 'Te Huanui'.[47] The plan showed that the university could be rezoning the site for institutional use, demolishing the Gordon Wilson Flats, while retaining the nearby McLeans Flats. The area would then be used to create a gateway between the hilltop Kelburn campus, and the city below, including an outdoor plaza and new teaching and research facilities. The development would also create a pedestrian and elevator link up to the Kelburn campus.[48] Renovation work commencing on Wellington Town Hall. National Centre for Music[edit] See also: New Zealand School of Music In 2019, Victoria University, on behalf of the New Zealand School of Music, signed an agreement with Wellington City Council and the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra to establish a new National Music Centre based in Wellington Town Hall.[49] This would be established once refurbishment work on the town hall had been completed. Victoria University vice-chancellor Grant Guilford believed the national music centre would provide a real uplift for music and music education. The state-of-the-art teaching, rehearsal, research and performance spaces that it will offer will enable an outstanding education for the next generation of musicians The Living Pā[edit] The Living Pa will be a redevelopment of the marae and surrounding area of the Kelburn campus.[50] This will involve the removal of five buildings from 42 to 50 Kelburn Parade and the creation of a new building employing principles based on the Living Building Challenge. Preparation work began in mid 2021, starting with the clearance and demolition of existing buildings on the construction site. Organisation and administration[edit] Day-to-day governance is in the hands of the University Council, which consists of 20 people: four elected by the Court of Convocation, three elected by the academic staff, one elected by the general staff, two appointed by the student union executive, four appointed by the Minister of Education, four selected by the Council itself, and the Vice-Chancellor. The Court of Convocation is composed of all graduates who choose to participate. Charles Wilson, at the time the chief librarian of the parliamentary library, was a member of the original council and its chairman for two years.[51] For New Zealand residents entry to most courses is open, with a few exceptions. Performance Music requires an audition. There is selection for entry into the second year in degrees such as the LLB, BArch and BDes. BA in criminology and creative writing is also based on selection. It is one of only three institutions (University of Auckland and Unitec being the others) to offer a degree in architecture in New Zealand. It owns the New Zealand School of Music. Faculties[edit] Faculty of Law on the left, Houses of Parliament on the right.The faculties are: Wellington Faculty of Architecture and Design Innovation[52] Wellington School of Business and Government[53] Wellington Faculty of Education[54] Wellington Faculty of Engineering[55] Wellington Faculty of Graduate Research[56] Wellington Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences[57] Faculty of Law[58] Wellington Faculty of Science[59] Wellington Faculty of Health[60] Faculty of Law[edit] The Faculty of Law is located in the restored Old Government Buildings at the centre of the country's law-making precinct, in close proximity to Parliament, the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal, and the District and High courts. The Faculty is rated 65th in the world in the 2021 QS World University Rankings[61] and led New Zealand's law faculties for research in the most recent Performance-Based Research Fund Evaluation in 2006.[62] Academic profile[edit] University rankingsGlobal – OverallARWU World[63]401-500 (2020)CWUR World[64]657 (2019-2020)QS World[65]223 (2021)THE World[66]501–600 (2021) National – OverallARWU National[67]3-4 (2020)CWUR National[68]5 (2018-2019) Academic rankings[edit] World University Rankings Year QS World University Rankings[69] Academic Ranking of World Universities[70] Times Higher Education World University Rankings[71] 2020 215 301–400 501–600 2019 221 301–400 401–500 2018 219 301–400 401–500 2017 228 301–400 351–400 2016 229 301–400 351–400 2015 275 276–300 Research centres and institutes[edit] Victoria University Coastal Ecology Laboratory Victoria has more than 40 research centres and institutes, including MacDiarmid Institute for Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology Robinson Research Institute[72] Ferrier Research Institute Malaghan Institute of Medical Research Victoria University Coastal Ecology Laboratory Centre for Strategic Studies New Zealand Language Learning Centre Adam Art Gallery New Zealand Electronic Text Centre Antarctic Research Centre To see more, browse an A-Z List of Research Centres and Institutes[73] Student life[edit] Offices of the Victoria University of Wellington Students' Association.

In April 2020, during the COVID-19 outbreak, the university came under fire from students, politicians, and media for suddenly announcing at 48 hours notice that they would be charging students a ""placeholder fee"" ($150 per week) for student accommodation that they had been forcibly removed from, despite emails from the university previously telling those same students that they would not have to pay.[86][87][88] Notable academics and staff[edit] Main category: Victoria University of Wellington faculty James Belich, historian Doreen Blumhardt, education academic Jonathan Boston, public policy academic Mai Chen, public law lawyer Paul Callaghan, physical sciences academic Margaret Clark, political science academic Sally Davenport, management academic Lloyd Geering, religious studies academic Robert Walker Hay FRSE, chemist Frank Holmes, economics academic George Edward Hughes, philosophy academic Joanna Kidman, sociologist Allison Kirkman, sociologist Wendy Larner, social scientist, Provost Douglas Lilburn, music academic Richard Cockburn Maclaurin, mathematics academic Bill Manhire, author and poet Douglas Mews, academic and early keyboard specialist Paul Morris, religious studies academic Peter Munz, history academic Terence O'Brien, diplomat and academic Tipene O'Regan, Māori leader and education academic Vincent O'Sullivan, academic and poet Geoffrey Palmer, politician Matthew Palmer, law academic Pat Ralph, marine biologist; first woman at Victoria to be awarded a DSc[89] Prof. James Renwick, climate scientist and science communicator Ivor Richardson, lawyer and academic Claudia Scott, public policy academic Kim Sterelny, philosophy academic Teresia Teaiwa, Pacific studies academic, author, poet Matt Visser, specialist in general relativity Colleen Ward, cross-cultural psychologist academic Colin J.

Learn More Enjoy studying in New Zealand’s lively, capital city In anticipation of the border reopening and enhanced visa processing, we are pleased to accept applications beginning with the fall 2022 term. Wellington is the vibrant, political and cultural hub of New Zealand, placed on a beautiful harbor where the Australian and Pacific tectonic plates meet. This unique combination of place and culture is reflected in the wonderful range of course offerings, and the university is a favorite for both domestic and international students, especially those studying in the areas of film, literature, politics and international relations, gender studies, earth sciences, Māori culture and language, music, theater and creative writing. The campus rubs shoulders with parliament, NGOs, key national research and scientific organizations, as well as Weta Workshop (the creators of Lord of the Rings’ visual effects), Te Papa (the Museum of NZ), the National Library, and the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra.

First Year of Investment 2015 The Challenge In India, nearly two thirds of children cannot do basic arithmetic. More than 75 percent of all students are behind at least one or more grade in math. At these rates, more than half the children in Indian schools will finish primary school without having learned basic arithmetic. In many low-cost primary schools, teachers are undertrained, often working with outdated curricula. The Innovation Vikalp works with low-cost private schools to improve learning outcomes through an experiential math curriculum, utilizing learning aids and math kits along with supporting teacher development for primary students. The company’s proprietary, integrated curriculum, which is in line with modern educational practices, engages students with different learning styles, ensuring they can visualize and grasp math concepts easily. Vikalp takes a holistic approach and builds in continuous, comprehensive evaluation into its curriculum assessment. The Impact Since May 2015, Vikalp has partnered with 78 schools, reaching more than 20,000 students through its programs. Roughly 80 percent of Vikalp students are estimated to come from households earning less than $4 per day. After 20 months of using Vikalp’s methodology, students have shown up to 50 percent of improvement in their math test scores. Over the next five years, the company is projected to reach nearly 500 schools and serve more than 670,000 students.

After a project goes missing, she is humiliated by her employer, Bose, and consoled by her room-mate, Suzy; co-worker, Sidhwani, and boyfriend, Rohan. She faces more humiliation this time at the hands of Rohan's parents, but cheers up after she is able to locate her missing project after hacking into her employer's system. This does not auger well with Bose who wants to know how she managed to do this, but she refuses to divulge this and quits. Subsequently, she re-locates to Bangkok, where Sidhwani has arranged her employment with Puyet Software. Shortly after her rather dramatic arrival she impresses her boss, Jackson, with her abilities, is suitably rewarded but must also deal with the fact that she in the country through a Tourist permit. Jackson undertakes to look into this issue, but ends up complicating the matter even more after her name gets changed to that of a former employee, Priya Menon. Rashika does not know that soon she will be arrested by the police for a number of offenses including Drug-trafficking, prostitution, etc. while her employer will accuse her of cyber-crimes including hacking into their computer system and misappropriating money. —rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)suspectPlot summaryAdd synopsisGenresCrimeDramaMysteryThrillerParents guideAdd content advisoryUser reviews1ReviewDetailsEditRelease dateJanuary 7, 2011 (India)Country of originIndiaLanguagesEnglishMarathiHindiThaiProduction companiesMadhav MoviesOnkar EntertainmentSee more company credits at IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime2h 10minColorColorSound mixDolby DigitalContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapBy what name was Vikalp (2011) officially released in Canada in English?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit pageMost anticipated Indian movies and showsPercentage shows amount of top page views.1Mumbai Diaries 26/1120.0%2Ravan Leela14.3%3Jayeshbhai Jordaar10.0%4Annabelle Sethupathi8.6%5Seeti Maar8.6%6Bhoot Police8.6%7Kya Meri Sonam Gupta Bewafa Hai8.6%8Thalaivi8.6%9Most Eligible Bachelor7.1%10Looop Lapeta5.7%Updates approximately every 20 minutes.More to exploreListIMDb's Fall 2021 Movie GuideSee the full listListThe Best Upcoming Sci-Fi & Fantasy Movies and TVSee the full listRecently viewedPlease enable browser cookies to use this feature. Learn more.Get the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppHelpSite IndexIMDbProIMDb TVBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads© 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.",Vikalp

98,"Viracao » Quem somos Contrast Font Português Who We Are Blog Contact Us Donate Who We Are About Acting Programs About Hi there! Before we go any further, we’d like to introduce ourselves. We’re a non-profit organization that acts to promote and defend the rights of adolescents and youth. Through communication, education and advocacy, we organize teens, youth and educators to promote a just, participative and plural society. How do we do that? Through educommunication and peer education. Educommunication is our way to communicate and educate at the same time, establishing a real dialog and effective participation. Conceptually, educommunication is a set of actions that aims to amplify self expression in educational spaces, as well as to develop critical spirit in users. And all this happens in a very democratic way. It’s important to emphasize that all the work we do is based on the understanding that adolescentes are subjects of rights. Therefore, they need to be considered in their unique condition of development, with specific vulnerabilities and potentialities, acknowledging their cultural, social and racial diversity. In Viração, we’ve been doing that since 2003! Through our work, we’ve impacted the lives of millions of people, collaboratively producing communication products with and for teens and young people throughout Brazil. We’ve published magazines, guides, documentaries, fanzines… we even run an online news portal! Besides working to reach the whole development of young people, we also act to establish a whole and integrative communication, one that is understood not only by its technological and instrumental end. Viração also executes projects and provides consulting services for organizations willing to work with different issues that affect younger generations, such as health, gender and sexuality, environment, climate change, education and culture. Our work around mobilization and advocacy has proven to be so effective that, besides our headquarters in the city of São Paulo, we rely on a articulated network of adolescentes and young people from 22 different Brazilian states, and the Federal Disctrict. In 2016 we funded Viração’s international branch, Viração&Jangada, in Trento, Italy. Mission To inspire and to connect adolescents and young people to build a just, participative and plural society through educommunication processes and practices. A viração Adolescents and young people with guaranteed rights and actively participating in the transformation of the world.

Blacksburg, as well as the surrounding county, is dominated economically and demographically by the presence of Virginia Tech (Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University).[6] Blacksburg, Christiansburg, and the city of Radford are the three principal jurisdictions of the Blacksburg-Christiansburg Metropolitan Statistical Area, which encompasses those jurisdictions and all of Montgomery, Pulaski, and Giles counties for statistical purposes. The MSA has an estimated population of 181,863[7] and is currently one of the faster-growing MSAs in Virginia. In 2011, BusinessWeek named Blacksburg as the ""Best Place in the U.S. to Raise Kids"".[8] Also in 2011, readers of Southern Living named Blacksburg the ""Best College Town in the South"".[9] Its public transportation system, Blacksburg Transit, which also connects to the neighboring town of Christiansburg, has repeatedly been recognized for the quality of its service.[10] Blacksburg High School, which in 2013 opened a new building,[11] is often ranked among the top schools of the nation for its academics. Its soccer, track, and cross-country teams are also among the top in the state. Blacksburg was the scene of the Virginia Tech shootings on April 16, 2007, when 32 people were killed and 17 wounded by a lone gunman. At the time, it was the deadliest shooting carried out by a single gunman in U.S. history, and generated considerable media coverage and discussion.

Abraham Wood, who commanded Fort Henry on the frontier (now the site of Petersburg, Virginia), and operated an Indian trading post nearby, organized several expeditions to explore farther west. A passage over the ridge was finally found in 1671 when explorers Batts and Fallam, sent by Wood, reached the present-day location of Blacksburg, Virginia. Their expedition followed Stroubles Creek, through the current locations of the town and campus of Virginia Tech, to what they named Wood's River. They reported the area as inhabited by the Monacan and Moneton, Siouan-speaking groups, but the Virginia colonial legislature had authorized Wood to claim it. Accordingly, on September 17, 1671, the Batts and Fallam party claimed all of the lands comprising the river's drainage basin for King Charles II. However, the region was not yet open to English patent. In 1700, Seneca warriors of the Iroquois Confederacy based in New York and Pennsylvania, overran the entire area, driving out the other bands. As early as 1718, the Seneca had agreed to sell the parts they had conquered east of the Blue Ridge to the Virginia Colony. However, following another cession at the 1744 Treaty of Lancaster, there was a dispute between the tribe and colonists over whether the new boundary was the Alleghenies or the Ohio River. The site of Blacksburg lay just within this disputed zone. By the 1740s, the Wood's River Land Company, represented by Colonel James Patton, gained a large tract of land within present-day southwest Virginia. Part of the tract became Montgomery County and Pulaski County and was sold to Virginian, Irish, Scots-Irish, and English settlers as a reward for their services during the Spanish-Indian Wars and other wars. The Draper and Ingles families were among those who built their homes at Draper's Meadow by 1748; this area was between the present location of the campus and the subdivision of Hethwood. Because of its strategic location between powerful Indian nations, who alternately allied with the French or British as it suited them, plus its location through gaps into the Alleghenies further west, the area's development was viewed with increasing apprehension by the French and their Indian allies. In July 1755, during the French and Indian War, hostile Shawnee Indians equipped and armed by France attacked the frontier outpost at Draper's Meadow, which then had around twenty pioneer settlers. About four settlers were killed in the attacks, and five were taken captive to Kentucky by the Shawnee, among them Mary Draper Ingles, who later escaped. The memorial to Draper's Meadow massacre was dedicated on a bridge located near Duck Pond. By the end of the war, Draper's Meadow was deserted.[12][13] By the Treaty of Easton (1758), and again by the Royal Proclamation of 1763, the British Crown made the Allegheny ridge separating the Mississippi and Chesapeake watersheds the official boundary between their Virginia colony and native peoples. It remained so until 1768, when native claims to the land including Blacksburg were cleared by the Treaty of Hard Labour with the Cherokee, and the Treaty of Fort Stanwix with the Six Nations (Iroquois Confederacy). The Shawnee finally abandoned their claim to this territory in 1774 following Dunmore's War. The Black family (1772–1797)[edit] Samuel Black, whose family settled in Staunton, Virginia, bought 600 acres (2.4 km2) of land in the Draper's Meadow area for his sons John and William in 1772. Smithfield Plantation, built in approximately 1774 by Colonel William Preston,[13] was developed on the original Draper's Meadow site, near the current location of the Duck Pond on the Virginia Tech campus. When Samuel Black died in 1792, the land was evenly divided into two sections by his sons. The road now known as Draper Road is the dividing line between the sections. John Black's property was later developed as the majority of the central campus of Virginia Tech. In 1797, William Black laid out a small grid of streets and lots comprising 16 blocks on a portion of his land. The original town was limited to the area bounded by present-day Draper Road, Jackson Street, Wharton Street, and Clay Street.[12] The town logo contains 16 small squares that create a larger square, representing the original 16 square blocks that were a part of Black's design. Blacksburg's establishment (1798–1870)[edit] Blacksburg's old town hall The downtown Post Office in Blacksburg After Black petitioned the state legislature to establish a town at the site, the official establishment and founding of Blacksburg was January 13, 1798 on the 38.75-acre (15.68 ha) tract that he laid out.[14] The following August 4, he signed over the deed to the town trustees.[12] The town was named after him in his honor. In 1808, a log cabin was built just east of Smithfield Plantation. Robert Preston, a future colonel of the 28th Virginia Infantry,[15] lived here, as did two Virginia governors. The cabin was later added to in the mid 19th century to create a Greek Revival farmhouse now known as Solitude, which is the oldest building on the Virginia Tech campus. In 1872, the 250 acre Solitude farm became the central campus of Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College, and the house, after the death of its owner in the following decade, served as a college infirmary from 1882 to 1886. It was later used for faculty housing.[16] According to records of the Post Office Department of the National Archives and Records Administration, the post office was established as ""BLACKSBURGH"" on April 8, 1827. The name was changed to the current spelling (without the ""h"") in 1893.[17] The Methodists had built two cabins to worship in since the town's founding, but they did not build a more permanent structure until 1830, when they constructed a brick church.[18] The Presbyterians were the next Christian denomination to build a church within Blacksburg's limits. In 1848 they built their first brick building[19] at 117 South Main Street. Though still standing, this building has not been used as a church for many years.[18] It was once South Main Café,[20] but is currently used as a restaurant called Cabo Fish Taco.[21] It is also the oldest building on Main Street.[19] The Baptists founded the third oldest church in the town in 1852.[18] In 1832, Westview Cemetery was established from a few acres of land that were deeded to trustees.[18] One of the first educational establishments started here was the Blacksburg Female Academy in 1840.[20] The Olin and Preston Institute (re-charted as Preston and Olin Institute in 1869) was a Methodist-sponsored academy established in 1851.[22] The first bank in Montgomery County, Blacksburg Savings Institution, was established in 1849.[20] The first newspaper published in Blacksburg was the Montgomery Messenger. Its first issue was printed in 1869.[22] Incorporation, modernization (1871–1951)[edit] Coal Breaker of the Virginia Anthracite Coal Company at Merrimac Mines near Blacksburg, 1904 In 1871, the village that became known as Blacksburg was incorporated[17] and Thomas W. Jones became the first mayor.[23] One year later, the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College opened its doors on October 2, 1872 with a faculty of three members.[17] The college grew and became known as Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, which shortly afterward became informally referred to as Virginia Tech. It is a Virginia land-grant university. A fire-fighting unit was organized within the university in 1899.[18] The town bought its first fire truck 43 years later.[20] The Blacksburg First Aid and Life Saving Crew was founded in 1951 and renamed Blacksburg Volunteer Rescue Squad in another addition to the growing amount of emergency services.[20] The first automobile came through the town in 1901. Three years later the train entered Blacksburg from Christiansburg using the Virginia Anthracite & Coal Railroad, which later became known as the ""Huckleberry.""[24] Traffic in Blacksburg increased sufficiently enough that by January 1913 the town voted against allowing cows to continue to roam in town. The first filling station was opened in 1919 and at the time was the only one between Roanoke, Virginia and Bluefield, West Virginia.[24] The town's first landing strip was built in 1929 and was 1,800 feet (548.64 m) in length. The grass landing strip was given airport status in 1931 and later became Virginia Tech Airport. Local buses began to make their rounds for the first time in 1947.[20] The town's first theater was built in 1909. It was a precursor to the Lyric Theatre on College Avenue.[25] In the spring of 1935, Main Street was strung with ten street lights from Roanoke Street northward to the top of the hill, where it now intersects the Alumni Mall. By October the town's second stoplight was installed on Main Street at Roanoke Street and was synchronized with the original one at Main and College.[24] The establishment of official law enforcement began in 1937 when Officer Dave ""Highpockets"" Sumner became the first Blacksburg police officer. The first police car was purchased nine years later.[20] Compulsory education and commercialization (1952–1992)[edit] Intersection of Main Street and College Avenue Blacksburg experienced a boost of compulsory education during the second half of the 20th century. Even though there had been a place for secondary education somewhere in town since 1906, it was not until 1952 when the first facility for Blacksburg High School was built on South Main and Eheart Streets. Later it moved to new quarters and was adapted as Blacksburg Middle School. That same year, all high schools in Montgomery County began operating on a twelve-grade basis which is still county policy to this day.[26] The Margaret J. Beeks Elementary School and the Gilbert F. Linkous Elementary School were both completed in 1963 and Harding Avenue Elementary School was built in 1972.[20] Two years later, in 1974, Blacksburg High School moved its location to Patrick Henry Drive after 20 years of issues with overcrowding in its previous location.[26] Jack Goodwin was appointed the first chief of police by the Blacksburg Town Council in 1954. Jan Olinger was made the first female police officer in 1976.[20] 1958 marked the beginning of the end for the railroad that came to be known as the ""Huckleberry."" In the 1960s, however, railroads underwent restructuring. Passenger service came to an end on July 25. On June 30, 1966 the last freight train arrived at the Blacksburg depot. Within 24 hours, the depot was closed, the empty cars were picked up, and the tracks were immediately removed.[24] After years of effort by the citizens of the town a trail was constructed on the former railroad right-of-way and, after years of construction, funding and planning issues the Huckleberry Trail was opened to the public on December 1, 1998. 190 years after its original construction, the newly renovated Smithfield Plantation house was re-opened in 1964.[20] The amount of commercialization in the area began to increase in the mid-1960s. The Corning Glass Works (now called Corning Incorporated), based in upper New York State, opened a manufacturing facility in 1964 that is located south of Blacksburg. The Blacksburg Municipal Building on South Main Street was constructed in 1969.[20] Terrace View apartments, the first large student complex, was built in 1970. The Blacksburg Branch of the Montgomery County Library was opened the same year. Ten years later, it was moved into the facility that used to house the Blacksburg Lumber Company on Draper Road. In 1971, Blacksburg ratified a new charter and LewisGale Hospital Montgomery was built. The University Mall shopping center opened that year as well. In the mid 1970s the Foxridge apartments, an even larger student apartment complex, was built as part of the Hethwood development. During 1981, the Blacksburg Community Center opened. It cost the town $1.2 million to build.[20] By 1988, the New River Valley Mall, located in the neighboring town of Christiansburg, was opened[24] and the Virginia Tech Corporate Research Center had its first ground-breaking ceremony.[22] After construction of Virginia's portion of Interstate 81 began in 1957, nine years passed before the Christiansburg-area segment was opened.[27] About half that amount of time passed before the U.S. Route 460 bypass opened in 1969.[20] In the 1970s, Virginia Tech was annexed into the town and the town acquired other land. Together with the effect of the annexations, the population grew from 9,000 people to 30,000 during this decade. Replacing the old public bus system, Blacksburg Transit began running in 1983.[28] Information age (1993–present)[edit] Market Square Park, home of the Blacksburg Farmers Market since 2009 Blacksburg is the site of the Blacksburg Electronic Village or BEV, conceived as a computer networking project of Virginia Tech in 1991 and officially born in 1993 as a way to link the town together using the Internet. This project quickly ushered the town into what is being called the Information Age. In 1994, Montgomery County Public Schools completed construction of Kipps Elementary School at 2801 Prices Fork Road.[20] By this time, Blacksburg had five elementary schools, a middle school, and a high school.[26] A newly renovated Blacksburg branch library was opened in 1996.[20] In the aftermath of railroad restructuring, many rail lines were abandoned. After 24 years of abandonment and six years of planning and construction, the first phase of the Huckleberry Trail built on the old Huckleberry railbed opened in 1996. The second phase of construction was completed in 1998.[20] In 2019, the Blacksburg Rotary Mountain Bike Skills Park opened with funding from Blacksburg Parks and Recreation and donations. On July 8, 1997, ground was broken for the experimental ""Smart Road"" project. The second phase of construction was completed in 2002.[29] The road is currently closed to the public and used as a research test bed for the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute. A National Weather Service office is located in Blacksburg and serves most of southwestern Virginia, southeast West Virginia, and northwest North Carolina. In 2003, the new building for Blacksburg Middle School students opened on Prices Fork Road adjacent to the property housing Kipps Elementary School. On April 16, 2007, Seung-Hui Cho shot 32 people dead and injured an additional 17 in the Virginia Tech shooting before committing suicide. The massacre is the deadliest mass shooting on a college campus since the Texas Clock Tower Massacre in 1966. On February 13, 2010, following a snowstorm that dropped two feet of snow on the area, the gymnasium roof on the previously occupied Blacksburg High School suffered a catastrophic structural failure and collapsed, causing structural damage to other areas of the school. The school building was condemned and students attended night school on a split schedule with the Blacksburg Middle School students at their school for the remainder of the year. It was determined that repair costs would exceed $18 million and would not be feasible given the age of the school; it was decided not to repair the building. Before the school year of 2013-14 Blacksburg High School was operating on a normal schedule out of the Blacksburg Middle School building on 3109 Prices Fork Road, and the middle schoolers were going to school in the old Christiansburg Middle School. The original Blacksburg High School building was vacant until it was demolished in the Summer of 2011. The newly constructed school building of Blacksburg High School which opened for the 2013 fall semester is located at 3401 Bruin Lane, behind the current Blacksburg Middle School and Bill Brown Football Stadium.[11] Geography[edit] Overlooking Blacksburg According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 19.89 square miles (51.5 km2) of which 19.89 square miles (51.5 km2) is land and 0.04 square miles (0.10 km2), or 0.10%, is water. At 2,080 feet (634 m) above sea level, Blacksburg is located in the New River Valley and also sits astride the Eastern Continental Divide. It is the 15th largest municipality[30] and the largest town in the commonwealth of Virginia.[31] The Eastern Continental Divide traverses the Virginia Tech Montgomery Executive Airport. The tallest building in Blacksburg is Slusher Tower, a twelve-story residence hall on the Virginia Tech campus. The building with the highest elevation is actually Hoge Hall (formerly Lee Hall), another residence hall, which until May 17, 2009 was home to the transmitter of campus radio station WUVT. The tower for WUVT now sits atop Price Mountain.[32] Climate[edit] Due to its elevation, the climate of Blacksburg is a hot-summer humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification: Dfa), being cooled down from the lowland areas, all of which possess a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification: Cfa). Summers are humid with warm to hot temperatures, although the area sees significantly cooler temperatures than places of lower elevation at the same latitude, with only 5 days of 90 °F (32 °C)+ highs annually.[33] Winters are generally cool to cold, with occasional intervening warm periods and an average of 0.9 nights of sub-0 °F (−18 °C) lows.[33] Monthly mean temperatures range from 31.9 °F (−0.1 °C) in January to 71.7 °F (22.1 °C) in July. Snowfall averages 24.7 inches (63 cm) per season and generally occurs from December to March, although significant snowfall has been recorded outside of those months.

The two roads, together with State Route 114, US 11, and State Route 8 provide the major highway infrastructure for the developing area. The Virginia Tech Transportation Institute is currently working with the Virginia Department of Transportation to build the Virginia Smart Road which will connect Blacksburg directly to I-81, thus significantly decreasing the travel time between Blacksburg and its larger metro neighbor, Roanoke. The road, together with the current US 460, will create a loop around Blacksburg, thus alleviating current traffic congestion on US 460 and aiding further development of the area. Public transportation[edit] Blacksburg Transit (BT) provides bus transportation primarily to and from the campus of Virginia Tech. Students and faculty ride the BT fare free with a flat payment included in the cost of tuition. Virginia Tech subsidizes BT for this service. Transportation is available to anyone for a fee, and during special events the service is often free. Blacksburg Transit also offers shuttle service to non-students on Virginia Tech Football game days for $5 to be transported from outlying parking areas to the stadium.[35] The Smart Way Bus, a regional commuter bus service operated by Valley Metro (Roanoke), provides connecting service between Virginia Tech, downtown Blacksburg, Christiansburg, Virginia, Roanoke–Blacksburg Regional Airport, and Roanoke, Virginia, where riders can transfer to an Amtrak train. Fare is $4.00 one way. Air[edit] At nearby Roanoke–Blacksburg Regional Airport, there are scheduled commercial flights to Atlanta, Charlotte, Chicago–O'Hare, New York–LaGuardia, Orlando/Sanford, Philadelphia, St. Petersburg/Clearwater, and Washington–Dulles, and there are seasonal charter flights to Atlantic City. Virginia Tech Montgomery Executive Airport, located in the Town of Blacksburg, has general aviation, air taxi, and military flights.

Over 110 countries are represented by the student body of Virginia Tech and individuals from the community during the festival. There are food trucks, country booths, and the stage features an eclectic mix of melodies and musical performances from around the world.[46] Steppin' Out, the town's first annual street festival, has taken place on the first Friday and Saturday of every August since 1976 when it was known as the Deadwood Days Summer Festival.[20] The festival's name was changed in 1980. Steppin' Out features over 150 artists and crafts people from around the United States selling unique handcrafted items, local merchants holding final clearance sidewalk sales, local restaurants selling food through outdoor vending, multiple stages for live performances, and fun for the entire family. The area from North Main Street and Alumni Mall (sometimes even more to the north) to South Main Street and Roanoke Street and Draper Road and Lee Street is designated for the festival. The Draper Mile Run, which was started in 1982, is a one-mile (1.6 km) road race for runners of all ages that is held annually during the first evening of the festival.[47] Summer Solstice Fest takes place on the Saturday afternoon/evening closest to the solstice.

Since its founding as a land-grant college in 1872, Virginia Tech has grown to an enrollment of more than 36,000 students across Virginia. The university offers a wide range of majors through its seven undergraduate colleges, two professional colleges, Graduate School, and Honors College. Inside and outside of the classroom, in living-learning communities, and in collaboration across academic disciplines, Virginia Tech students engage in experiential learning. Virginia Tech is also a leading global research institution that conducts more than $530 million in research annually. The university boasts world-class research institutes and facilities that solve big problems—such as the Smart Road transportation research testbed, and the Cube, a four-story theater and laboratory in the Moss Arts Center. The LINK, LICENSE, and LAUNCH team is dedicated to supporting all aspects of corporate partnerships from research collaborations, to corporate giving, to technology commercialization and start-ups. Global Land-Grant Land-grant institutions were created with the specific mission of providing educational opportunities for individuals who had not historically attended college, and for applying research to the practical needs of society. At the time, the focus was on local and regional advancement in agriculture and engineering. Today, Virginia Tech serves as a global force for positive change by providing opportunities for education and service to individuals around the world who can benefit from our particular strengths in engineering; architecture and design; physical, biological, medical and social sciences; business; and natural resources. Virginia Tech’s motto, Ut Prosim (That I May Serve), is deeply ingrained in the university’s learning, discovery, and engagement. It represents a value system that guides students’ decisions and helps mold them into responsible citizens of the world. Expanding Our Reach Virginia Tech has built a network of international research and public service partnerships, including major presences in Europe, India, and Africa. The university’s international presence is anchored by the Steger Center for International Scholarship in Riva San Vitale, Switzerland. We also have a major research and education presence in the greater Washington, D.C., metro area that connects us with global initiatives through governmental and corporate partnerships. In the D.C. area, the university is developing a 1 million-square-foot Innovation Campus that will become a global center of talent production and technology excellence, part of a $1.1 billion tech-talent package Vir­ginia had the foresight to offer in persuading Amazon to locate its second headquarters in the commonwealth. In Roanoke, Virginia, the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at VTC—with a vision to amass a concentration of biomedical research talent and catalyze it with the resources of a major research university and an enterprising health care system, then give it the freedom to innovate—and the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine are a part of the university’s Health Sciences and Technology Campus. Several recent discoveries have been patented and are centerpieces of spin-off companies, including a brain cancer stem cell therapeutic and a diagnostic screen for alcohol abuse risk, both of which have won highly competitive federal technology transfer business awards. Research Institutes Virginia Tech's research institutes enhance the university’s ability to address large-scale research opportunities with world-class faculty expertise and specially equipped, advanced laboratories. Fralin Life Science Institute Hume Center (Cybersecurity) Institute for Creativity, Arts, and Technology Institute for Critical Technology and Applied Science Institute for Society, Culture, and Environment Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at VTC (Medical Sciences) Virginia Tech Transportation Institute Destination Areas Transdisciplinary communities work within the framework of nine Destination Areas to collaboratively address complex problems that impact the human condition. These teams are working across boundaries to address challenges in rural health, infectious disease, coastal mitigation, brain health and development, and security. Virginia Tech professors have a reputation for imagining the next great thing—from blind-driver cars to energy-conscious homes to inventing the farm of tomorrow—and then making it happen. Diversity and Inclusion Guided by its Principles of Community, the university is dedicated to increasing access, inclusion, and diversity in order to create a community that nurtures learning and growth for all of its members. Hands-On, Minds-On Learning Learning is experiential when it connects knowledge with action, resulting in deeper applied understandings. Experiential learning at Virginia Tech is participatory; students engage in learning, activities, and reflections that connect them with others in the community, challenge them in authentic ways, and support their growth as citizens, humanitarians, and professionals. Virginia Tech students develop disciplinary depth, interdisciplinary abilities, and purpose-driven engagement. This is accomplished through experiential learning opportunities that include both curricular and outside-the-classroom activities.

(December 2009) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The High Street of Oxford, a prototypical example of a university town. There is no central campus, rather university buildings are scattered around the city between shops, for example those at centre right of the picture. A college town or university town is a community (often a separate town or city, but in some cases a town/city neighborhood or a district) that is dominated by its university population. The university may be large, or there may be several smaller institutions such as liberal arts colleges clustered, or the residential population may be small, but college towns in all cases are so dubbed because the presence of the educational institution(s) pervades economic and social life. Many local residents may be employed by the university—which may be the largest employer in the community—many businesses cater primarily to the university, and the student population may outnumber the local population. Contents 1 Description 2 Town–gown relations 3 Settlement in college towns 4 See also 5 Notes 6 References Description[edit] Kuopio, North Savonia, home to the Savonia University of Applied Sciences In Europe, a university town is generally characterised by having an ancient university. The economy of the city is closely related with the university activity and highly supported by the entire university structure, which may include university hospitals and clinics, printing houses, libraries, laboratories, business incubators, student rooms, dining halls, students' unions, student societies, and academic festivities. Moreover, the history of the city is often intertwined with that of the university. Many European university towns have not been merely important places of science and education, but also centres of political, cultural and social influence throughout the centuries.[1] As an example of this, Paris also illustrates the course of educational history with the Sorbonne and the Grande école.[2] Besides a highly educated and largely transient population, a stereotypical college town often has many people in non-traditional lifestyles and subcultures and with a high tolerance for unconventionality in general, and has a very active musical or cultural scene. The majority of the population is usually politically liberal.[citation needed] Many have become centres of technological research and innovative startups. Universities with start-up centers can be large cities like Munich, but also small cities like Trieste.[3] Although the concept of a university town has developed since the European Middle Ages, equivalents already existed in earlier times and in non-European cultures. For example, in later Classical times the city of Athens – no longer having any political or military power, but renowned as the greatest center of learning in the Roman Empire – had many of the characteristics of a university town, and is sometimes called such by modern scholars. Town–gown relations[edit] Main article: Town and gown Ann Arbor, Michigan, home to the University of Michigan As in the case of a company town, the large and transient university population may come into conflict with other townspeople. Students may come from outside the area, and perhaps subscribe to a different—sometimes radically different—culture.[citation needed] Most students are young people, whose living habits may be different from older people. Economically, the high spending power of the university and of its students in aggregate may inflate the cost of living above that of the region. It is common for university employees to commute from surrounding areas, finding the cost of living in town too expensive.[citation needed] Studentification, in which a growing student population move in large numbers to traditionally non-student neighborhoods, may be perceived as a form of invasion or gentrification. It may be due to university enrollment expanding beyond the capacity of on-campus housing, inadequate zoning enforcement, and/or student culture. Neighborhood associations may work to limit conversion of family homes to student rentals, while some local residents may oppose the construction of large on-campus dormitories or expansion of fraternity and sorority houses, forcing a growing enrollment to seek housing in town. Moreover, a single-family home can be converted into several smaller rental units, or shared by a number of students whose combined resources exceed those of a typical single-family rental—a strong incentive for absentee landlords to cater to students.[citation needed] In the US, educational institutions are often exempted from local taxes, so in the absence of a system for payments in lieu of taxes, the university population will disproportionately burden parts of the local public infrastructure, such as roads or law enforcement. Some analysts argue that students relieve the burden on other parts of the local public infrastructure, such as local primary and secondary schools, by far the most costly line item in most North American city and town budgets, by providing tax revenues through local sales tax and property tax paid by landlords. When a university expands its facilities, the potential loss of property tax revenue is thus a concern, in addition to local desire to preserve open space or historic neighborhoods. As a result, local people may resent the university and its students.[citation needed] The students, in turn, may criticize the local residents' taking jobs at the university provided by student tuition and fees, and accepting the tax revenues (e.g. local sales tax, property tax on rented properties) that students generate, but resenting students' lifestyles. Some students refer to other inhabitants as ""townies"", a term with somewhat derogatory connotations. This ""town and gown"" dichotomy notwithstanding, students and the outside community typically find a peaceful (even friendly) coexistence, with the town receiving significant economic and cultural benefits from the university, and the students often adapting to the culture of the town.[citation needed] Settlement in college towns[edit] Claremont, California, home to the Claremont Colleges While noise, traffic, and other quality of life issues have not been resolved, some advocates of New Urbanism have led the development of neighborhoods in college towns by specifically capitalizing on their proximity to university life. For instance, some universities have developed properties to allow faculty and staff members to walk to work, reducing demand for limited on-campus parking; Duke University's Trinity Heights development is a key example. In many cases, developers have built communities where access to the university (even if not directly adjacent) is promoted as an advantage. Student housing is also an important component of college towns. In the United States most state universities have 50 percent or more of their enrolled students living off-campus. This trend, which began in the 1960s, originally meant the conversion of near campus single-family homes to student housing, creating ""student ghettos."" Cambridge, home to the University of Cambridge Colleges and other developers began building purpose-built off-campus student housing areas in the 1970s in more college towns. Beginning around 2000 in the United States, nationwide real estate investment trusts (REIT) and publicly traded corporations began developing student housing complexes. Another notable development since the 1990s is the surge in popularity of retirees relocating to college towns. Retirees are attracted to these locations because of cultural and educational opportunities, college athletic events, good medical facilities (often at teaching hospitals affiliated with medical schools), a low cost of living, and often a pedestrian- or public transit-friendly development pattern. Several development companies now specialize in constructing retirement communities in college towns. In some cases the communities have developed formal relationships with the local institution. The demand for housing from students, faculty, staff, and retirees has kept college town home prices stable during the housing market downturn that began in 2005.[4] See also[edit] List of college towns Student quarter Town and gown Company town Notes[edit] ^ Christian Cwik, Michael Zeuske ""Rettet die Unis und die Unistädte"", In: science-ORF 14 June 2020. ^ Pierre Bourdieu, Monique de Saint Martin, ""La Noblesse d’État.

115,"Vitae Civilis: history and achievements | Richard Sandbrook's Place Jump to navigation Richard Sandbrook's Place Re-imagining sustainable development Search form Search Main menu Home Themes Timeline Perspectives Authors Pictures Richard Sandbrook About Vitae Civilis: history and achievements Vitae Civilis – the Institute for Development, Environment and Peace, in Brazil – was set up in 1989, following the Bruntland Report. Its mission is to support communities to build sustainable societies, as Rubens Born describes. The emergence of Vitae Civilis - Institute for Development, Environment and Peace, in Brazil - coincided with moments of great importance in the national and international scenario in the second half of the twentieth century. Some of the accounts that led up to its creation were the re-democratization of Brazil - a political transition that ended the military regime (1964-85) and generated a new Federal Constitution (1988) based on the valuation of citizen participation - and welcoming into the country the World Commission on Environment and Development of the United Nations (UN) in 1985, which later resulted in the ""Brundtland Report"". At that time, its founders had already worked with some kind of militancy in favor of citizenship and direction of development. Touched by the Brundtland commission report, ""Our Common Future"" as a conceptual platform and policy, and by the new constitutional order in Brazil, they created Vitae Civilis on September 18, 1989. Its name, which means ""for the civil society"" in Latin, expresses the objective that supports its mission to serve as a tool for building sustainable societies. It also reinforces its guidance in working for the strengthening of citizenship and of civil society organizations. Integrating sustainable development's dimensions from the outset Since its inception, one of its differentials was to be active in various spheres and themes to address the various dimensions of sustainability. That is, Vitae Civilis always set out to think, in an integrated manner, the environmental, social, economic, cultural and scientific issues in its various spheres of activity - global, national and local. Another important inspiration is to believe that the building of sustainability is also the building of peace. Since then, Vitae Civilis became successful in its actions, whether by its pioneering themes or its modus operandi, always seeking to associate technical and scientific knowledge on the one hand, and rights and social demands on the other. For Vitae Civilis uses the work tripod Policy, Practice and Research as a strategic foundation. In the first half of the 1990s, for example, little was said in cultivating and promoting the use of medicinal plants as part of the strategy for environmental conservation and income generation for the population in the Atlantic Forest region. During this period, work activities were carried out with the communities and residents of the Vale do Ribeira, São Paulo, in order to promote conciliation between improving the quality of life of people who live there and the conservation of that biome. Called “Da Mata à Casa”, the project mixed research with field action for income generation and poverty eradication using conservation of medicinal plants, and was awarded the Henry Ford Award of Environmental Conservation (honorable mention) in 1997. Everything so far has been possible due to focus on a few selected areas, association of motivated people, good technical and scientific knowledge and perspective to qualify and articulate proposals for well settled public policies, allowing for systemic effects, surpassing positive impacts of local projects. Moreover, Vitae Civilis has also always been attentive to communication challenges. Its first bulletins, between 1993 and 1995, were printed when the Internet was still in its infancy in Brazil. Then, the institute started having a regular newsletter for news publications and texts depicting the work of various NGOs and activities of the society; and even today, the institute keeps different channels on YouTube, Twitter, Facebook and Google+, as well as its website. Overcoming funding challenges Throughout its history, Vitae Civilis found low success in achieving financial sustainability and producing content for others to learn from its experiences. International support was prevalent at the beginning of its activities, and gradually the institute also began fundraising in Brazil. But two difficult moments were faced. The first was in early 1996, when two organizations canceled their support for reasons that did not involve projects. With few resources left, it was decided to close the office, but still keep the team, who worked from their homes. It was an absolutely necessary step to take back in order to take two steps forward, since the institute overcame the situation in early 1997, when better conditions than before were achieved thanks to the credibility of the work done thus far. At that time, it was essential to go through the evaluation process of what had already been reached and reshape the organization and its programs. A second tricky moment came in early 2009, when several supporters were affected by the economic crisis, and even with signed contracts or approved projects, Vitae Civilis failed to receive a significant portion of resources. This time, the office was kept in a smaller space and the staff was downsized. What allowed for the overcoming of this phase was the image of the Institute, because despite running with minimal structure, the name Vitae Civilis allowed, and still allows, for the maintenance of relationships cultivated over the years. Credibility in the actions and the fact that the Institute always honors its commitments were essential. Nevertheless, the measures that allowed for the continuity of some lines of work led to the temporary suspension of others. In 2010, the headquarters of Vitae Civilis was moved back to the city of São Paulo to facilitate new partnerships and actions, and since then, there has been considerable growth and institutional renewal. With the experience obtained while facing these moments, it was clear that credibility, seriousness and engagement are assets of Vitae Civilis. The challenges of disseminating lessons learnt The fact that it hasn’t been possible to systematize and disseminate lessons learned in the desired fashion, especially at the beginning of the activities, it is also regarded as less successful. Vitae Civilis believes that the lessons and perspectives experienced could have been better shared. This is because, for the institute, the narratives are extremely important so other people are encouraged and learn. The changes in this respect came with time. Since 2000, as a result of an institutional guideline, the experiences of the institute became better shared in the form of books, videos, technical assistance for society groups, training activities (capacity building) and workshops, just to name a few. Maintaining regular communication channels in English and Spanish is also a desire that needs to be further explored. To improve these issues, some steps are already underway, with a new communication plan and an employee focused on fundraising. Working with IIED Regarding the contribution of the IIED, one of the founders of Vitae Civilis, Mr. Rubens Harry Born, had the opportunity to pay a visit to its headquarters in 1989 during a trip through Europe with the goal of starting conversations regarding Rio 92. Since then Vitae Civilis has always been interested in being aware of the work done by Richard Sandbrook and his team members. It is also worth noting that in early 2002, Vitae Civilis was invited to join the ""Ring Alliance"" network, which under the leadership of the IIED and inspired by the dialogue and cooperation fostered by Richard, brought together organizations involved with monitoring and compliance of international agreements of Rio 92. In the process of Rio+20, the institute managed to accomplish initiatives in conjunction with the IIED, whether to work with the UN or to share perspectives and proposals of civil society groups. As a result of this synergy, Vitae Civilis recognizes the important values ​​such as persistence, regularity in the activities, perseverance and building alliances that inspired Richard Sandbrook and others who seek to give their best for a better world.

With a total area of 5,136 km2 (1,983 sq mi) of which 173 km2 (67 sq mi) is water, it is the largest province of the Netherlands.[5] Gelderland shares borders with six other provinces (Flevoland, Limburg, North Brabant, Overijssel, South Holland and Utrecht) and the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The capital is Arnhem (pop. 159,265[6]); however, Nijmegen (pop. 176,731) and Apeldoorn (pop. 162,445) are both larger municipalities. Other major regional centres in Gelderland are Ede, Doetinchem, Zutphen, Harderwijk, Tiel, Wageningen, Zevenaar, and Winterswijk. Gelderland had a population of 2,084,478 as of November 2019.[2] Contents 1 History 1.1 Culture 2 Geography 2.1 Municipalities 2.2 Abolished municipalities 3 Economy 4 Religion 5 Cultural references 6 References 7 External links History[edit] Historically, the province dates from states of the Holy Roman Empire and takes its name from the nearby German city of Geldern. According to the Wichard saga, the city was named by the Lords of Pont who fought and killed a dragon in 878 AD. They named the town they founded after the death rattle of the dragon: ""Gelre!""[7] The County of Guelders arose out of the Frankish pagus Hamaland in the 11th century around castles near Roermond and Geldern. The counts of Gelre acquired the Betuwe and Veluwe regions and, through marriage, the County of Zutphen. Thus the counts of Guelders laid the foundation for a territorial power that, through control of the Rhine, Waal, Meuse and IJssel rivers, was to play an important role in the later Middle Ages. The geographical position of their territory dictated the external policy of the counts during the following centuries; they were committed to the interests of the Holy Roman Empire and to expansion south and west. Further enlarged by the acquisition of the imperial city of Nijmegen in the 13th century, the countship was raised to a duchy in 1339 by the Holy Roman Emperor, Louis IV. After 1379, the duchy was ruled from Jülich and by the counts of Egmond and Cleves. The duchy resisted Burgundian domination, but William, Duke of Jülich-Cleves-Berg was forced to cede it to Charles V in 1543, after which it formed part of the Burgundian-Habsburg hereditary lands.[8] The duchy revolted with the rest of the Netherlands against Philip II of Spain and joined the Union of Utrecht (1579). After the deposition of Philip II, its sovereignty was vested in the States of Gelderland, and the princes of Orange were stadtholders. In 1672, the province was temporarily occupied by Louis XIV and, in 1713, the southeastern part including the ducal capital of Geldern fell to Prussia. Part of the Batavian Republic (1795–1806), of Louis Bonaparte’s Kingdom of Holland (1806–10), and of the French Empire (1810–13), Gelderland became a province of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1815.[8] During the Second World War, it saw heavy fighting between Allied Paratroopers, British XXX Corps and the German II SS Panzer Corps, at the Battle of Arnhem. Culture[edit] In Gelderland there are many museums, like the Netherlands Open Air Museum and Museum Arnhem in Arnhem, Valkhof Museum in Nijmegen, the Het Loo Palace in Apeldoorn and in Otterlo the Kröller-Müller Museum. There are several large theatres in Gelderland such as the Stadsschouwburg in Nijmegen, Stadstheater in Arnhem and Orpheus (theater) in Apeldoorn. Some cities are also equipped with large concert halls like MUSIS (formerly: Musis sacrum) in Arnhem and Concertgebouw de Vereeniging in Nijmegen. The known by a larger public pop-music venues are Luxor Live in Arnhem, Doornroosje in Nijmegen, Gigant in Apeldoorn and the GelreDome stadium in Arnhem. Every year the municipality Renkum and Overbetuwe receive a large amount of tourist visiting because of the Battle of Arnhem. Often historical locations are visited, like the John Frost Bridge and the Arnhem Oosterbeek War Cemetery in Oosterbeek. Geography[edit] Gelderland can roughly be divided into four geographical regions: the Veluwe in the north, the Rivierenland including the Betuwe in the southwest, the Achterhoek (literally meaning the ""back corner"") or Graafschap (which originally means earldom or county) in the east and the city-region of Arnhem and Nijmegen in the centre-south.

GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was €33,000 or 110% of the EU27 average in the same year.[9] Religion[edit] Religion in Gelderland (2015)[10] Not religious (46.3%)  Protestant Church in the Netherlands (23.2%)  Catholicism (21.6%)  Other (5.3%)  Islam (3.6%) Cultural references[edit] In the 2001 movie A Knight's Tale, the protagonist, William Thatcher (played by Heath Ledger) pretends to be a knight known as ""Ulrich von Lichtenstein from Gelderland"".

It is also a member of the Euroleague for Life Sciences (ELLS) university network. WUR has been placed among the top 150 universities in the world by four major ranking tables. Wageningen has been voted the number one university in the Netherlands for fifteen consecutive years. The university is listed number 59 in the world by the Times Higher Education Ranking and the world's best in agriculture and forestry by the QS World University Rankings 2016–2020.[2][3][4][5][6] Wageningen University is ranked number one in the fields of plant/animal science, environment/ecology, and agricultural sciences by U.S. News & World Report.

(July 2019) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In 1876 the Rijkslandbouwschool (National Agricultural College) was established in Wageningen. Due to the development of the training to a higher educational level it changed in 1896 to the Hoogere Land- en Boschbouwschool (Agricultural and Forestry College) and in 1904 in Rijks Hoogere Land-, Tuin- en Boschbouwschool (National Agricultural, Horticulture and Forestry College). In 1918 the school became academic by law (Academic Education Act). The name changed to Rijks Landbouw Hoogeschool (National Agricultural College). The opening date and official start date is 9 March 1918. In 1986 the ""hogescholen"" (comparable to scientific institute of technology) were renamed to University in a modification of the Academic Education Act. The new name became Landbouwuniversiteit Wageningen (LUW) (Wageningen Agricultural University (WAU)). The 1986 law changes resulted in the use of the name hogeschool in the Dutch system to be used exclusively for universities of applied science. Over the years the research and teaching branched out into life sciences in general, while interest for agriculture as a career opportunity waned. In 1997, when the DLO institutes merged with the university, the new organisation was rebranded as Wageningen UR (Wageningen University and Research Centre); with the University being renamed Wageningen University. Under Dutch laws the University and the institutes had to remain separate legal entities. In 2006, the university of applied sciences Van Hall Larenstein became part of Wageningen UR. The idea was to create better collaboration between applied teaching and research at Van Hall and the academic research at Wageningen University. This would also support students to continue with an academic program upon completing their applied degree. However, due to differences in organizational culture and incompatibility of procedures, the collaboration remained problematic. In 2012 it was decided that Van Hall Larenstein would leave Wageningen UR and continue as an independent school once more. In the spring of 2015 the separation was marked by the move of the final Wageningen-based Van Hall Larenstein studies back to Velp. In 2009 it was decided that the University would consistently use the English name in its communication, and that university research could be presented under the name of the university: Wageningen University (WU) (as an alternative of using the name Wageningen UR).[8][9] On 6 September 2016 Wageningen University and the research institutes becameas one joint brand: Wageningen University & Research (WUR). On 9 March 2018 Wageningen University celebrated her 100 years anniversary. During this year there were many events and festivities around the campus and in the city of Wageningen. Academic profile[edit] Wageningen University was the first Dutch university or school that was allowed to use the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS) label. This label is awarded by the European Commission and guarantees the quality of the study programme. The university consequently applies this system, thus promoteing the mobility of students within Europe and preventing study delay. BSc programmes[edit] Forum, one of the eye-catchers on the Wageningen Campus The University offers 19 BSc programmes[10] (2018-2019). For some BSc programmes, the language of instruction is English. Other programmes teach in both Dutch and English. The programmes start each year in September, last three years, and consist of 180 ECTS credits. The programmes are in the field of economy and society, health, life sciences and technology, nature and environment, animals and plants. MSc programmes[edit] Panorama of the greenhouse of the Lumen building Wageningen University offers 36 different MSc programmes[11] (2017-2018) and two online masters programs.[12] The language of instruction for all Master's programmes is English. The programmes start each year in September, they last two years, and consist of 120 ECTS credits. Most programmes offer various specializations and possibilities for majors. PhD programme[edit] The PhD programme is a four-year programme which consists of a research component (conducting research under supervision and writing a thesis) and a smaller education component (up to 15 percent of the total PhD time). To apply for a PhD position, the applicant must contact one of the six Graduate Schools of Wageningen University.[13] In order to guarantee adequate supervision, the research subject must fit in the research programme of a Graduate School. Research Institutes[edit] The following research institutes are part of Wageningen Research: Wageningen Environmental Research, formerly Alterra[14] Wageningen Economic Research, formerly LEI Wageningen UR[15] Wageningen Bioveterinary Research, formerly Central Veterinary Institute[16] Wageningen Centre for Development Innovation, formerly Centre for Development Innovation[17] Wageningen Food & Biobased Research, formerly Food & Biobased Research[18] Wageningen Livestock Research[19] Wageningen Marine Research, formerly IMARES[20] Wageningen Plant Research[21] Dairy Campus[22][23][24] Wageningen Food Safety Research, formerly RIKILT[25] Controversy[edit] Wageningen University and Research has come under fire due to claims of partiality in research.[26][27] One case regards a research concerning bee colony collapse disorder.[28] Research conducted by Tjeerd Blacquière on the topic has caused controversy due to funding received for the research from the German pesticide producer Bayer,[28] the world's biggest producer of neonicotinoid insecticides, a suspect factor for the colony collapse disorder.[29][30] In 2018 the Dutch magazine OneWorld went to court in an attempt to demand access to contracts between WUR and Bayer, Syngenta and Monsanto, but OneWorld ultimately lost the court case.[31] Panorama of the campus of Wageningen University & Research Rankings[edit] International Rankings[edit] University rankingsGlobal – OverallARWU World[32]151-200 (2020)CWTS World[33]59 (2020)QS World[34]=115 (2021)THE World[35]=62 (2021)USNWR Global[36]=83 (2021) Global – Life sciences and medicineARWU Life sciences[37]36 (2016)QS Agriculture and Forestry[38]1 (2021)QS Life Sciences & Medicine[39]59 (2021)THE Life Sciences[40]18 (2021) Global – Science and engineeringTHE Engineering[41]97 (2021) In the field of life sciences, agricultural and environmental science, the university is considered world-class.[42][43][44] According to the Times Higher Education World University Rankings it is the best university in the Netherlands and No. 1 worldwide, in agriculture and forestry for 2017 on the QS World University Rankings charts.[45] In the 2019 U.S. News & World Report Ranking[46] Wageningen University & Research is ranked first in agricultural sciences, plant and animal sciences, and environment/ecology.

In 1997, when the DLO institutes merged with the university, the new organisation was rebranded as Wageningen UR (Wageningen University and Research Centre); with the University being renamed Wageningen University. Under Dutch laws the University and the institutes had to remain separate legal entities. In 2006, the university of applied sciences Van Hall Larenstein became part of Wageningen UR. The idea was to create better collaboration between applied teaching and research at Van Hall and the academic research at Wageningen University. This would also support students to continue with an academic program upon completing their applied degree. However, due to differences in organizational culture and incompatibility of procedures, the collaboration remained problematic. In 2012 it was decided that Van Hall Larenstein would leave Wageningen UR and continue as an independent school once more. In the spring of 2015 the separation was marked by the move of the final Wageningen-based Van Hall Larenstein studies back to Velp. In 2009 it was decided that the University would consistently use the English name in its communication, and that university research could be presented under the name of the university: Wageningen University (WU) (as an alternative of using the name Wageningen UR).[8][9] On 6 September 2016 Wageningen University and the research institutes becameas one joint brand: Wageningen University & Research (WUR). On 9 March 2018 Wageningen University celebrated her 100 years anniversary. During this year there were many events and festivities around the campus and in the city of Wageningen. Academic profile[edit] Wageningen University was the first Dutch university or school that was allowed to use the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS) label. This label is awarded by the European Commission and guarantees the quality of the study programme. The university consequently applies this system, thus promoteing the mobility of students within Europe and preventing study delay. BSc programmes[edit] Forum, one of the eye-catchers on the Wageningen Campus The University offers 19 BSc programmes[10] (2018-2019). For some BSc programmes, the language of instruction is English. Other programmes teach in both Dutch and English. The programmes start each year in September, last three years, and consist of 180 ECTS credits. The programmes are in the field of economy and society, health, life sciences and technology, nature and environment, animals and plants. MSc programmes[edit] Panorama of the greenhouse of the Lumen building Wageningen University offers 36 different MSc programmes[11] (2017-2018) and two online masters programs.[12] The language of instruction for all Master's programmes is English. The programmes start each year in September, they last two years, and consist of 120 ECTS credits. Most programmes offer various specializations and possibilities for majors. PhD programme[edit] The PhD programme is a four-year programme which consists of a research component (conducting research under supervision and writing a thesis) and a smaller education component (up to 15 percent of the total PhD time). To apply for a PhD position, the applicant must contact one of the six Graduate Schools of Wageningen University.[13] In order to guarantee adequate supervision, the research subject must fit in the research programme of a Graduate School. Research Institutes[edit] The following research institutes are part of Wageningen Research: Wageningen Environmental Research, formerly Alterra[14] Wageningen Economic Research, formerly LEI Wageningen UR[15] Wageningen Bioveterinary Research, formerly Central Veterinary Institute[16] Wageningen Centre for Development Innovation, formerly Centre for Development Innovation[17] Wageningen Food & Biobased Research, formerly Food & Biobased Research[18] Wageningen Livestock Research[19] Wageningen Marine Research, formerly IMARES[20] Wageningen Plant Research[21] Dairy Campus[22][23][24] Wageningen Food Safety Research, formerly RIKILT[25] Controversy[edit] Wageningen University and Research has come under fire due to claims of partiality in research.[26][27] One case regards a research concerning bee colony collapse disorder.[28] Research conducted by Tjeerd Blacquière on the topic has caused controversy due to funding received for the research from the German pesticide producer Bayer,[28] the world's biggest producer of neonicotinoid insecticides, a suspect factor for the colony collapse disorder.[29][30] In 2018 the Dutch magazine OneWorld went to court in an attempt to demand access to contracts between WUR and Bayer, Syngenta and Monsanto, but OneWorld ultimately lost the court case.[31] Panorama of the campus of Wageningen University & Research Rankings[edit] International Rankings[edit] University rankingsGlobal – OverallARWU World[32]151-200 (2020)CWTS World[33]59 (2020)QS World[34]=115 (2021)THE World[35]=62 (2021)USNWR Global[36]=83 (2021) Global – Life sciences and medicineARWU Life sciences[37]36 (2016)QS Agriculture and Forestry[38]1 (2021)QS Life Sciences & Medicine[39]59 (2021)THE Life Sciences[40]18 (2021) Global – Science and engineeringTHE Engineering[41]97 (2021) In the field of life sciences, agricultural and environmental science, the university is considered world-class.[42][43][44] According to the Times Higher Education World University Rankings it is the best university in the Netherlands and No. 1 worldwide, in agriculture and forestry for 2017 on the QS World University Rankings charts.[45] In the 2019 U.S. News & World Report Ranking[46] Wageningen University & Research is ranked first in agricultural sciences, plant and animal sciences, and environment/ecology. In the 2017/2018 National Taiwan Ranking[47] Wageningen University is ranked first in the field of agriculture.[48] In the 2017/2018 National Taiwan Ranking[47] Wageningen University is ranked first in the field of Environment & Ecology.[49] In the 2016 Shanghai Ranking Wageningen University was ranked in the bracket 101-150th best universities in the world overall[50] and 36th best in the life and agriculture sciences.[51] In the 2017 Times Higher Education World University Rankings[52] Wageningen University was ranked 25th overall in the world and 16th in life sciences. In the Academic Ranking of World Universities 2017[53] Wageningen University & Research is ranked first in the field of Food Science & Technology.[54] In the 2016/2017 QS World University Rankings, Wageningen University was ranked 119th overall in the world, first in the field of agriculture and forestry, fourth in environmental science, 13th in development studies, and 83rd in life sciences and medicine.[55] National rankings[edit] The Dutch 'Keuzegids [nl]' ranking compares Dutch universities based on reviews by their own students. In 2020 Wageningen University is ranked as the best university in the Netherlands in full-time education for the 16th time in a row. In 2015 Wageningen University was awarded as the most sustainable Dutch University by Morgen (organization) [nl], for the third time in a row. 100 years WUR on the campus Student activities and associations[edit] The mascot of the university, the WURwolf M.S.V. Alchimica is the study association for students Molecular Life Sciences. Since 1970 it has been organising different activities for its members.[56] CODON is the study Association for all Biotechnology (BBT and MBT), Bioinformatics (MBF) and Biobased Sciences (MBS) students. Established by the first students of Bioprocestechnologie on 16 September 1991. At that time the association carried the name ""BiPS"" which was later changed to CODON.[57] Nitocra is the study association for students of International Land and Water management. Semper Florens is the study association for students of the bachelor Plant Sciences (BPS), the master Plant Sciences (MPS), the master Plant Biotechnology (MPB) and the master Organic Agriculture (MOA).

It is the largest of four constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.[17][18][19] In Europe, the Netherlands consists of twelve provinces, bordering Germany to the east, Belgium to the south, and the North Sea to the northwest, with maritime borders in the North Sea with those countries and the United Kingdom.[20] In the Caribbean, it consists of three special municipalities: the islands of Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba.[i] The country's official language is Dutch, with West Frisian as a secondary official language in the province of Friesland, and English and Papiamento as secondary official languages in the Caribbean Netherlands.[1] Dutch Low Saxon and Limburgish are recognised regional languages (spoken in the east and southeast respectively), while Dutch Sign Language, Sinte Romani, and Yiddish are recognised non-territorial languages.[1][2] The four largest cities in the Netherlands are Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, and Utrecht.[22] Amsterdam is the country's most populous city and nominal capital,[23] while The Hague holds the seat of the States General, Cabinet and Supreme Court.[24] The Port of Rotterdam is the busiest seaport in Europe, and the busiest in any country outside East Asia and Southeast Asia, behind only China and Singapore.[25] Amsterdam Airport Schiphol is the busiest airport in the Netherlands, and the third busiest in Europe. The country is a founding member of the European Union, Eurozone, G10, NATO, OECD, and WTO, as well as a part of the Schengen Area and the trilateral Benelux Union. It hosts several intergovernmental organisations and international courts, many of which are centred in The Hague, which is consequently dubbed 'the world's legal capital'.[26] Netherlands literally means ""lower countries"" in reference to its low elevation and flat topography, with only about 50% of its land exceeding 1 m (3.3 ft) above sea level, and nearly 26% falling below sea level.[27] Most of the areas below sea level, known as polders, are the result of land reclamation that began in the 14th century.[28] Colloquially or informally the Netherlands is occasionally referred to by the pars pro toto Holland.[15] With a population of 17.4 million people, all living within a total area of roughly 41,800 km2 (16,100 sq mi)—of which the land area is 33,500 km2 (12,900 sq mi)—the Netherlands is the 16th most densely populated country in the world and the second-most densely populated country in the European Union, with a density of 521 people per square kilometre (1,350 people/sq mi). Nevertheless, it is the world's second-largest exporter of food and agricultural products by value, owing to its fertile soil, mild climate, intensive agriculture, and inventiveness.[29][30][31] The Netherlands has been a parliamentary constitutional monarchy with a unitary structure since 1848. The country has a tradition of pillarisation and a long record of social tolerance, having legalised abortion, prostitution and human euthanasia, along with maintaining a liberal drug policy. The Netherlands abolished the death penalty in Civil Law in 1870, though it was not completely removed until a new constitution was approved in 1983. The Netherlands allowed women's suffrage in 1919, before becoming the world's first country to legalise same-sex marriage in 2001. Its mixed-market advanced economy had the eleventh-highest per capita income globally.[32] The Netherlands ranks among the highest in international indexes of press freedom,[33] economic freedom,[34] human development and quality of life, as well as happiness.[35][j] In 2020, it ranked eighth on the human development index and fifth on the 2021 World Happiness Index.[37][38] Contents 1 Etymology 1.1 The Netherlands and the Low Countries 1.2 Holland 1.3 Dutch 1.4 Terminology in Dutch and other languages 2 History 2.1 Prehistory (before 800 BC) 2.2 Celts, Germanic tribes and Romans (800 BC–410 AD) 2.3 Early Middle Ages (411–1000) 2.4 High Middle Ages (1000–1384) 2.5 Burgundian, Habsburg and Spanish Habsburg Netherlands (1384–1581) 2.6 Dutch Republic (1581–1795) 2.7 Batavian Republic and Kingdom (1795–1890) 2.8 World wars and beyond (1890–present) 3 Geography 3.1 Geology 3.2 Floods 3.3 Delta Works 3.4 Climate 3.4.1 Climate change 3.5 Nature 3.6 Caribbean islands 4 Government and politics 4.1 Political culture 4.2 Political parties 4.3 Government 4.4 Administrative divisions 4.5 Foreign relations 4.6 Military 5 Economy 5.1 Natural gas 5.2 Agriculture and natural resources 6 Demographics 6.1 Functional urban areas 6.2 Language 6.3 Religion 6.4 Education 6.5 Healthcare 7 Transport 7.1 Road transport 7.2 Public transport 7.3 Cycling 7.4 Water transport 7.5 Air transport 8 Culture 8.1 Art, architecture and philosophy 8.2 Southern Netherlands 8.3 Dutch value system 8.4 Dutch people and ecology 8.5 Music 8.6 Film and television 8.7 Sports 8.8 Cuisine 8.9 Colonial heritage 9 See also 10 Notes 11 References 12 Further reading 13 External links Etymology Main article: Terminology of the Low Countries The Netherlands' turbulent history and shifts of power resulted in exceptionally many and widely varying names in different languages. There is diversity even within languages. In English, the Netherlands is also called Holland or (part of) the Low Countries, whereas the term ""Dutch"" is used as the demonym and adjectival form. The Netherlands and the Low Countries The region called the Low Countries (comprising Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg) have the same toponymy. Place names with Neder, Nieder, Nedre, Nether, Lage(r) or Low(er) (in Germanic languages) and Bas or Inferior (in Romance languages) are in use in low-lying places all over Europe. They are sometimes used in a deictic relation to a higher ground that consecutively is indicated as Super(ior), Up(per), Op(per), Ober, Boven, High, Haut or Hoch. In the case of the Low Countries / Netherlands the geographical location of the lower region has been more or less downstream and near the sea. The geographical location of the upper region, however, changed tremendously over time, depending on the location of the economic and military power governing the Low Countries area. The Romans made a distinction between the Roman provinces of downstream Germania Inferior (nowadays part of Belgium and the Netherlands) and upstream Germania Superior (nowadays part of Germany). The designation 'Low' to refer to the region returns again in the 10th century Duchy of Lower Lorraine, that covered much of the Low Countries.[39][40] But this time the corresponding Upper region is Upper Lorraine, in nowadays Northern France. The Dukes of Burgundy, who ruled from their residence in the Low Countries in the 15th century, used the term les pays de par deçà (""the lands over here"") for the Low Countries, as opposed to les pays de par delà (""the lands over there"") for their original homeland: Burgundy in present-day east-central France.[41] Under Habsburg rule, Les pays de par deçà developed in pays d'embas (""lands down-here""),[42] a deictic expression in relation to other Habsburg possessions like Hungary and Austria. This was translated as Neder-landen in contemporary Dutch official documents.[43] From a regional point of view, Niderlant was also the area between the Meuse and the lower Rhine in the late Middle Ages. The area known as Oberland (High country) was in this deictic context considered to begin approximately at the nearby higher located Cologne. From the mid-sixteenth century on, the ""Low Countries"" and the ""Netherlands"" lost their original deictic meaning. They were probably the most commonly used names, besides Flanders, a pars pro toto for the Low Countries, especially in Romance language-speaking Europe. The Eighty Years' War (1568–1648) divided the Low Countries into an independent northern Dutch Republic (or Latinised Belgica Foederata, ""Federated Netherlands"", the precursor state of the Netherlands) and a Spanish controlled Southern Netherlands (Latinised Belgica Regia, ""Royal Netherlands"", the precursor state of Belgium). The Low Countries today is a designation that includes the countries of the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg, although in most Romance languages, the term ""Low Countries"" is used as the name for the Netherlands specifically. It is used synonymously with the more neutral and geopolitical term Benelux. Holland The Netherlands is also referred to as Holland in various languages, including English. However, Holland proper is only a region within the country that consists of North and South Holland, two of the nation's twelve provinces. Formerly they were a single province, and earlier the County of Holland, a remnant of the dissolved Frisian Kingdom which also included parts of present-day Utrecht. Following the decline of the Duchy of Brabant and the County of Flanders, Holland became the most economically and politically important county in the Low Countries region. The emphasis on Holland during the formation of the Dutch Republic, the Eighty Years' War, and the Anglo-Dutch Wars in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries, made Holland serve as a pars pro toto for the entire country, which is now considered informal[44] or incorrect.[45][46] Nonetheless, the name ""Holland"" is still widely used for the Netherlands national football team, including in the Netherlands,[47] and the Dutch government's international websites for tourism and trade are ""holland.com"" and ""hollandtradeandinvest.com"".[48][49] In 2020, however, the Dutch government announced that it would only communicate and advertise under the name ""the Netherlands"" in the future.[50] Dutch The term Dutch is used as the demonymic and adjectival form of the Netherlands in the English language. The origins of the word go back to Proto-Germanic *þiudiskaz, Latinised into Theodiscus, meaning ""popular"" or ""of the people""; akin to Old Dutch Dietsch, Old High German duitsch, and Old English þeodisc, all meaning ""(of) the common (Germanic) people"". At first, the English language used (the contemporary form of) Dutch to refer to any or all speakers of West Germanic languages (e.g. the Dutch, the Frisians, and the Germans). Gradually its meaning shifted to the West Germanic people they had most contact with, because of their geographical proximity and for the rivalry in trade and overseas territories. The derivative of the Proto-Germanic word *þiudiskaz in modern Dutch, Diets, can be found in Dutch literature as a poetic name for the Dutch people or language, but is considered very archaic. Although it had a short resurgence after World War II to avoid the reference to Germany. It is still used in the expression ""diets maken"" – to put it straight to him/her (as in a threat) or, more neutral, to make it clear, understandable, explain, say in the people's language (cf. the Vulgate (Bible not in Greek or Hebrew, but Latin; the folks' language) in meaning vulgar, though not in a pejorative sense).

Please help improve this section if you can. (August 2020) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In Dutch, the names for the Netherlands, the Dutch language and a Dutch citizen are Nederland, Nederlands and Nederlander, respectively. Colloquially the country is also by the Dutch often referred to as Holland, although to lesser extent outside the two provinces North and South Holland, where it may even be used as a pejorative term, e.g. Hollènder (dialect) in Maastricht.[51] The plural Nederlanden has been used in many different connotations in the past,[52][circular reference] but since 1815, it is only used in the official name Koninkrijk der Nederlanden (""Kingdom of the Netherlands""). In many other languages the plural stuck, for example Niederlande (German), Pays-Bas (French) and Países Bajos (Spanish). In Indonesian (a former colony) the country is called Belanda, a name derived from 'Holland'. History Main article: History of the Netherlands Prehistory (before 800 BC) Main articles: Paleolithic Europe, Neolithic Europe, and Bronze Age Europe Oak figurine found in Willemstad (4500 BC) The prehistory of the area that is now the Netherlands was largely shaped by the sea and the rivers that constantly shifted the low-lying geography. The oldest human (Neanderthal) traces were found in higher soils, near Maastricht, from what is believed to be about 250,000 years ago.[53] At the end of the Ice Age, the nomadic late Upper Paleolithic Hamburg culture (c. 13.000–10.000 BC) hunted reindeer in the area, using spears, but the later Ahrensburg culture (c. 11.200–9500 BC) used bow and arrow. From Mesolithic Maglemosian-like tribes (c. 8000 BC) the oldest canoe in the world was found in Drenthe.[54] Indigenous late Mesolithic hunter-gatherers from the Swifterbant culture (c. 5600 BC) were related to the southern Scandinavian Ertebølle culture and were strongly linked to rivers and open water.[55] Between 4800 and 4500 BC, the Swifterbant people started to copy from the neighbouring Linear Pottery culture the practise of animal husbandry, and between 4300 and 4000 BC the practice of agriculture.[56] The Funnelbeaker culture (c. 4300–2800 BC), which is related to the Swifterbant culture, erected the dolmens, large stone grave monuments found in Drenthe. There was a quick and smooth transition from the Funnelbeaker farming culture to the pan-European Corded Ware pastoralist culture (c. 2950 BC). In the southwest, the Seine-Oise-Marne culture — which was related to the Vlaardingen culture (c. 2600 BC), an apparently more primitive culture of hunter-gatherers — survived well into the Neolithic period, until it too was succeeded by the Corded Ware culture. The Netherlands in 5500 BCBronze Age cultures in the Netherlands Of the subsequent Bell Beaker culture (2700–2100 BC) several regions of origin have been postulated, notably the Iberian peninsula, the Netherlands and Central Europe.[57] They introduced metalwork in copper, gold and later bronze and opened international trade routes not seen before, reflected in the discoveries of copper artifacts, as the metal is not normally found in Dutch soil. The many finds in Drenthe of rare bronze objects, suggest that it was even a trading centre in the Bronze Age (2000–800 BC). The Bell Beaker culture developed locally into the Barbed-Wire Beaker culture (2100–1800 BC) and later the Elp culture (c. 1800–800 BC),[58] a Middle Bronze Age archaeological culture having earthenware pottery of low quality as a marker. The initial phase of the Elp culture was characterised by tumuli (1800–1200 BC) that were strongly tied to contemporary tumuli in northern Germany and Scandinavia and was apparently related to the Tumulus culture in central Europe. The subsequent phase was that of cremating the dead and placing their ashes in urns which were then buried in fields, following the customs of the Urnfield culture (1200–800 BC). The southern region became dominated by the related Hilversum culture (1800–800 BC), which apparently inherited cultural ties with Britain of the previous Barbed-Wire Beaker culture. Celts, Germanic tribes and Romans (800 BC–410 AD) Main articles: Iron Age Europe, Celts, Germanic peoples, and Netherlands in the Roman era Diachronic distribution of Celts from 500 BC  Expansion into the southern Low Countries by 270 BC From 800 BC onwards, the Iron Age Celtic Hallstatt culture became influential, replacing the Hilversum culture. Iron ore brought a measure of prosperity and was available throughout the country, including bog iron. Smiths travelled from settlement to settlement with bronze and iron, fabricating tools on demand. The King's grave of Oss (700 BC) was found in a burial mound, the largest of its kind in western Europe and containing an iron sword with an inlay of gold and coral. The deteriorating climate in Scandinavia around 850 BC further deteriorated around 650 BC and might have triggered migration of Germanic tribes from the North. By the time this migration was complete, around 250 BC, a few general cultural and linguistic groups had emerged.[59][60] The North Sea Germanic Ingaevones inhabited the northern part of the Low Countries. They would later develop into the Frisii and the early Saxons.[60] A second grouping, the Weser-Rhine Germanic (or Istvaeones), extended along the middle Rhine and Weser and inhabited the Low Countries south of the great rivers. This group consisted of tribes that would eventually develop into the Salian Franks.[60] Also the Celtic La Tène culture (c. 450 BC up to the Roman conquest) had expanded over a wide range, including the southern area of the Low Countries. Some scholars have speculated that even a third ethnic identity and language, neither Germanic nor Celtic, survived in the Netherlands until the Roman period, the Iron Age Nordwestblock culture,[61][62] that eventually was absorbed by the Celts to the south and the Germanic peoples from the east. The Rhine frontier around 70 AD The first author to describe the coast of Holland and Flanders was the Greek geographer Pytheas, who noted in c. 325 BC that in these regions, ""more people died in the struggle against water than in the struggle against men.""[63] During the Gallic Wars, the area south and west of the Rhine was conquered by Roman forces under Julius Caesar from 57 BC to 53 BC.[62] Caesar describes two main Celtic tribes living in what is now the southern Netherlands: the Menapii and the Eburones. The Rhine became fixed as Rome's northern frontier around 12 AD. Notable towns would arise along the Limes Germanicus: Nijmegen and Voorburg. In the first part of Gallia Belgica, the area south of the Limes became part of the Roman province of Germania Inferior. The area to the north of the Rhine, inhabited by the Frisii, remained outside Roman rule (but not its presence and control), while the Germanic border tribes of the Batavi and Cananefates served in the Roman cavalry.[64] The Batavi rose against the Romans in the Batavian rebellion of 69 AD but were eventually defeated. The Batavi later merged with other tribes into the confederation of the Salian Franks, whose identity emerged at the first half of the third century.[65] Salian Franks appear in Roman texts as both allies and enemies. They were forced by the confederation of the Saxons from the east to move over the Rhine into Roman territory in the fourth century. From their new base in West Flanders and the Southwest Netherlands, they were raiding the English Channel. Roman forces pacified the region, but did not expel the Franks, who continued to be feared at least until the time of Julian the Apostate (358) when Salian Franks were allowed to settle as foederati in Texandria.[65] It has been postulated that after deteriorating climate conditions and the Romans' withdrawal, the Frisii disappeared as laeti in c. 296, leaving the coastal lands largely unpopulated for the next two centuries.[66] However, recent excavations in Kennemerland show clear indication of a permanent habitation.[67][68] Early Middle Ages (411–1000) Main articles: Frankish Kingdom and Frisian Kingdom Franks, Frisians and Saxons (710s AD) with Traiecturm and Dorestad in the middle After Roman government in the area collapsed, the Franks expanded their territories in numerous kingdoms. By the 490s, Clovis I had conquered and united all these territories in the southern Netherlands in one Frankish kingdom, and from there continued his conquests into Gaul. During this expansion, Franks migrating to the south eventually adopted the Vulgar Latin of the local population.[60] A widening cultural divide grew with the Franks remaining in their original homeland in the north (i.e. the southern Netherlands and Flanders), who kept on speaking Old Frankish, which by the ninth century had evolved into Old Low Franconian or Old Dutch.[60] A Dutch-French language boundary hence came into existence.[60][69] Frankish expansion (481 to 870 AD) To the north of the Franks, climatic conditions improved, and during the Migration Period Saxons, the closely related Angles, Jutes and Frisii settled the coastal land.[70] Many moved on to England and came to be known as Anglo-Saxons, but those who stayed would be referred to as Frisians and their language as Frisian, named after the land that was once inhabited by Frisii.[70] Frisian was spoken along the entire southern North Sea coast, and it is still the language most closely related to English among the living languages of continental Europe. By the seventh century a Frisian Kingdom (650–734) under King Aldegisel and King Redbad emerged with Traiectum (Utrecht) as its centre of power,[70][71] while Dorestad was a flourishing trading place.[72][73] Between 600 and around 719 the cities were often fought over between the Frisians and the Franks. In 734, at the Battle of the Boarn, the Frisians were defeated after a series of wars. With the approval of the Franks, the Anglo-Saxon missionary Willibrord converted the Frisian people to Christianity. He established the Archdiocese of Utrecht and became bishop of the Frisians. However, his successor Boniface was murdered by the Frisians in Dokkum, in 754. Rorik of Dorestad, Viking ruler of Friesland (romantic 1912 depiction) The Frankish Carolingian empire modelled itself on the Roman Empire and controlled much of Western Europe. However, in 843, it was divided into three parts—East, Middle, and West Francia. Most of present-day Netherlands became part of Middle Francia, which was a weak kingdom and subject of numerous partitions and annexation attempts by its stronger neighbours. It comprised territories from Frisia in the north to the Kingdom of Italy in the south. Around 850, Lothair I of Middle Francia acknowledged the Viking Rorik of Dorestad as ruler of most of Frisia.[74] When the kingdom of Middle Francia was partitioned in 855, the lands north of the Alps passed to Lothair II and subsequently were named Lotharingia. After he died in 869, Lotharingia was partitioned, into Upper and Lower Lotharingia, the latter part comprising the Low Countries that technically became part of East Francia in 870, although it was effectively under the control of Vikings, who raided the largely defenceless Frisian and Frankish towns lying on the Frisian coast and along the rivers. Around 879, another Viking expedition led by Godfrid, Duke of Frisia, raided the Frisian lands. The Viking raids made the sway of French and German lords in the area weak. Resistance to the Vikings, if any, came from local nobles, who gained in stature as a result, and that laid the basis for the disintegration of Lower Lotharingia into semi-independent states. One of these local nobles was Gerolf of Holland, who assumed lordship in Frisia after he helped to assassinate Godfrid, and Viking rule came to an end. High Middle Ages (1000–1384) A Medieval Tombe of the Brabantian knight Arnold van der Sluijs Main article: History of urban centers in the Low Countries The Holy Roman Empire (the successor state of East Francia and then Lotharingia) ruled much of the Low Countries in the 10th and 11th century but was not able to maintain political unity. Powerful local nobles turned their cities, counties and duchies into private kingdoms that felt little sense of obligation to the emperor. Holland, Hainaut, Flanders, Gelre, Brabant, and Utrecht were in a state of almost continual war or in paradoxically formed personal unions. The language and culture of most of the people who lived in the County of Holland were originally Frisian. As Frankish settlement progressed from Flanders and Brabant, the area quickly became Old Low Franconian (or Old Dutch). The rest of Frisia in the north (now Friesland and Groningen) continued to maintain its independence and had its own institutions (collectively called the ""Frisian freedom""), which resented the imposition of the feudal system. Around 1000 AD, due to several agricultural developments, the economy started to develop at a fast pace, and the higher productivity allowed workers to farm more land or to become tradesmen. Towns grew around monasteries and castles, and a mercantile middle class began to develop in these urban areas, especially in Flanders and later also Brabant. Wealthy cities started to buy certain privileges for themselves from the sovereign. In practice, this meant that Bruges and Antwerp became quasi-independent republics in their own right and would later develop into some of the most important cities and ports in Europe. Around 1100 AD, farmers from Flanders and Utrecht began draining and cultivating uninhabited swampy land in the western Netherlands, making the emergence of the County of Holland as the centre of power possible. The title of Count of Holland was fought over in the Hook and Cod Wars (Dutch: Hoekse en Kabeljauwse twisten) between 1350 and 1490. The Cod faction consisted of the more progressive cities, while the Hook faction consisted of the conservative noblemen. These noblemen invited the Duke Philip the Good of Burgundy — who was also Count of Flanders — to conquer Holland. Burgundian, Habsburg and Spanish Habsburg Netherlands (1384–1581) Main articles: Burgundian Netherlands, Habsburg Netherlands, and Spanish Netherlands Spanish NetherlandsThe Four Days' Battle, 1–4 June 1666 (Second Anglo-Dutch War) by Pieter Cornelisz van SoestThe Low Countries in the late 14th centuryWilliam I, Prince of Orange, leader of the Dutch Revolt, by Adriaen Thomasz. Key Most of the Imperial and French fiefs in what is now the Netherlands and Belgium were united in a personal union by Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, in 1433. The House of Valois-Burgundy and their Habsburg heirs would rule the Low Countries in the period from 1384 to 1581. Before the Burgundian union, the Dutch identified themselves by the town they lived in or their local duchy or county. The Burgundian period is when the road to nationhood began. The new rulers defended Dutch trading interests, which then developed rapidly. The fleets of the County of Holland defeated the fleets of the Hanseatic League several times. Amsterdam grew and in the 15th century became the primary trading port in Europe for grain from the Baltic region. Amsterdam distributed grain to the major cities of Belgium, Northern France and England. This trade was vital because Holland could no longer produce enough grain to feed itself. Land drainage had caused the peat of the former wetlands to reduce to a level that was too low for drainage to be maintained. Under Habsburg Charles V, ruler of the Holy Roman Empire and King of Spain, all fiefs in the current Netherlands region were united into the Seventeen Provinces, which also included most of present-day Belgium, Luxembourg, and some adjacent land in what is now France and Germany. In 1568, under Phillip II, the Eighty Years' War between the Provinces and their Spanish ruler began. The level of ferocity exhibited by both sides can be gleaned from a Dutch chronicler's report:[75] On more than one occasion men were seen hanging their own brothers, who had been taken prisoners in the enemy's ranks... A Spaniard had ceased to be human in their eyes. On one occasion, a surgeon at Veer cut the heart from a Spanish prisoner, nailed it on a vessel's prow, and invited the townsmen to come and fasten their teeth in it, which many did with savage satisfaction. The Duke of Alba ruthlessly attempted to suppress the Protestant movement in the Netherlands. Netherlanders were ""burned, strangled, beheaded, or buried alive"" by his ""Blood Council"" and his Spanish soldiers. Severed heads and decapitated corpses were displayed along streets and roads to terrorize the population into submission. Alba boasted of having executed 18,600,[76][77] but this figure does not include those who perished by war and famine. The first great siege was Alba's effort to capture Haarlem and thereby cut Holland in half. It dragged on from December 1572 to the next summer, when Haarlemers finally surrendered on 13 July upon the promise that the city would be spared from being sacked. It was a stipulation Don Fadrique was unable to honour, when his soldiers mutinied, angered over pay owed and the miserable conditions they endured during the long, cold months of the campaign.[78] On 4 November 1576, Spanish tercios seized Antwerp and subjected it to the worst pillage in the Netherlands' history. The citizens resisted, but were overcome; seven thousand of them were mowed down; a thousand buildings were torched; men, women, and children were slaughtered in a delirium of blood by soldiers crying, ""Santiago! España! A sangre, a carne, a fuego, a sacco!"" (Saint James! Spain! To blood, to the flesh, to fire, to sack!)[79] Map of the Habsburg dominions. From 1556 the dynasty's lands in the Low Countries were retained by the Spanish Habsburgs. The Spanish Fury at Maastricht, 1579 Following the sack of Antwerp, delegates from Catholic Brabant, Protestant Holland and Zeeland agreed, at Ghent, to join Utrecht and William the Silent in driving out all Spanish troops and forming a new government for the Netherlands. Don Juan of Austria, the new Spanish governor, was forced to concede initially, but within months returned to active hostilities. As the fighting restarted, the Dutch began to look for help from the Queen of England, but she initially stood by her commitments to the Spanish in the Treaty of Bristol of 1574. The result was that when the next large-scale battle did occur at Gembloux in 1578, the Spanish forces easily won the day, killing at least 10,000 rebels, with the Spanish suffering few losses.[80] In light of the defeat at Gembloux, the southern states of the Seventeen Provinces (today in northern France and Belgium) distanced themselves from the rebels in the north with the 1579 Union of Arras, which expressed their loyalty to Philip II of Spain. Opposing them, the northern half of the Seventeen Provinces forged the Union of Utrecht (also of 1579) in which they committed to support each other in their defence against the Spanish army.[81] The Union of Utrecht is seen as the foundation of the modern Netherlands. Spanish troops sacked Maastricht in 1579, killing over 10,000 civilians and thereby ensuring the rebellion continued.[82] In 1581, the northern provinces adopted the Act of Abjuration, the declaration of independence in which the provinces officially deposed Philip II as reigning monarch in the northern provinces.[83] Against the rebels Philip could draw on the resources of Spain, Spanish America, Spanish Italy and the Spanish Netherlands. The Protestant Queen Elizabeth I of England sympathised with the Dutch struggle against the Spanish and sent an army of 7,600 soldiers to aid the Dutch in their war with the Catholic Spanish.[84] English forces under the Earl of Leicester and then Lord Willoughby faced the Spanish in the Netherlands under the Duke of Parma in a series of largely indecisive actions that tied down significant numbers of Spanish troops and bought time for the Dutch to reorganise their defences.[85] The war continued until 1648, when Spain under King Philip IV finally recognised the independence of the seven north-western provinces in the Peace of Münster. Parts of the southern provinces became de facto colonies of the new republican-mercantile empire. Dutch Republic (1581–1795) Main articles: Dutch Republic and Evolution of the Dutch Empire Dutch East India Company factory in Hugli-Chuchura, Mughal Bengal by Hendrik van Schuylenburgh, 1665 After declaring their independence, the provinces of Holland, Zeeland, Groningen, Friesland, Utrecht, Overijssel, and Gelderland formed a confederation. All these duchies, lordships and counties were autonomous and had their own government, the States-Provincial. The States General, the confederal government, were seated in The Hague and consisted of representatives from each of the seven provinces. The sparsely populated region of Drenthe was part of the republic too, although it was not considered one of the provinces. Moreover, the Republic had come to occupy during the Eighty Years' War a number of so-called Generality Lands in Flanders, Brabant and Limburg. Their population was mainly Roman Catholic, and these areas did not have a governmental structure of their own, and were used as a buffer zone between the Republic and the Spanish-controlled Southern Netherlands.[86] Winter landscape with skaters near the city of Kampen by Hendrick Avercamp (1620s) Amsterdam's Dam Square in 1656 In the Dutch Golden Age, spanning much of the 17th century, the Dutch Empire grew to become one of the major seafaring and economic powers, alongside Portugal, Spain, France and England. Science, military, and art (especially painting) were among the most acclaimed in the world. By 1650, the Dutch owned 16,000 merchant ships.[87] The Dutch East India Company and the Dutch West India Company established colonies and trading posts all over the world, including ruling the northern parts of Taiwan between 1624–1662 and 1664–1667. The Dutch settlement in North America began with the founding of New Amsterdam on the southern part of Manhattan in 1614. In South Africa, the Dutch settled the Cape Colony in 1652. Dutch colonies in South America were established along the many rivers in the fertile Guyana plains, among them Colony of Surinam (now Suriname). In Asia, the Dutch established the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), and the only western trading post in Japan, Dejima. During the period of Proto-industrialization, the empire received 50% of textiles and 80% of silks import from the India's Mughal Empire, chiefly from its most developed region known as Bengal Subah.[88][89][90][91] Many economic historians regard the Netherlands as the first thoroughly capitalist country in the world. In early modern Europe, it had the wealthiest trading city (Amsterdam) and the first full-time stock exchange. The inventiveness of the traders led to insurance and retirement funds as well as phenomena such as the boom-bust cycle, the world's first asset-inflation bubble, the tulip mania of 1636–1637, and the world's first bear raider, Isaac le Maire, who forced prices down by dumping stock and then buying it back at a discount.[92] In 1672 – known in Dutch history as the Rampjaar (Disaster Year) – the Dutch Republic was at war with France, England and three German Bishoprics simultaneously. At sea, it could successfully prevent the English and French navy from entering the western shores. On land, however, it was almost taken over internally by the advancing French and German armies coming from the east. It managed to turn the tide by inundating parts of Holland but could never recover to its former glory again and went into a state of a general decline in the 18th century, with economic competition from England and long-standing rivalries between the two main factions in Dutch society, the republican Staatsgezinden and the supporters of the stadtholder the Prinsgezinden as main political factions.[93] Batavian Republic and Kingdom (1795–1890) Main articles: Batavian Republic, Kingdom of Holland, Sovereign Principality of the United Netherlands, United Kingdom of the Netherlands, and Kingdom of the Netherlands With the armed support of revolutionary France, Dutch republicans proclaimed the Batavian Republic, modelled after the French Republic and rendering the Netherlands a unitary state on 19 January 1795. The stadtholder William V of Orange had fled to England. But from 1806 to 1810, the Kingdom of Holland was set up by Napoleon Bonaparte as a puppet kingdom governed by his brother Louis Bonaparte to control the Netherlands more effectively. However, King Louis Bonaparte tried to serve Dutch interests instead of his brother's, and he was forced to abdicate on 1 July 1810. The Emperor sent in an army and the Netherlands became part of the French Empire until the autumn of 1813 when Napoleon was defeated in the Battle of Leipzig. Map of the Dutch colonial empire. Light green: territories administered by or originating from territories administered by the Dutch East India Company; dark green: the Dutch West India Company. In yellow are the territories occupied later, during the 19th century. William Frederick, son of the last stadtholder, returned to the Netherlands in 1813 and proclaimed himself Sovereign Prince of the Netherlands. Two years later, the Congress of Vienna added the southern Netherlands to the north to create a strong country on the northern border of France. William Frederick raised this United Netherlands to the status of a kingdom and proclaimed himself as King William I in 1815. In addition, William became hereditary Grand Duke of Luxembourg in exchange for his German possessions. However, the Southern Netherlands had been culturally separate from the north since 1581, and rebelled. The south gained independence in 1830 as Belgium (recognised by the Northern Netherlands in 1839 as the Kingdom of the Netherlands was created by decree), while the personal union between Luxembourg and the Netherlands was severed in 1890, when William III died with no surviving male heirs. Ascendancy laws prevented his daughter Queen Wilhelmina from becoming the next Grand Duchess. The submission of Diponegoro to General De Kock at the end of the Java War in 1830. Painting by Nicolaas Pieneman The Belgian Revolution at home and the Java War in the Dutch East Indies brought the Netherlands to the brink of bankruptcy. However, the Cultivation System was introduced in 1830; in the Dutch East Indies, 20% of village land had to be devoted to government crops for export. The policy brought the Dutch enormous wealth and made the colony self-sufficient. The Netherlands abolished slavery in its colonies in 1863.[94] Slaves in Suriname would be fully free only in 1873, since the law stipulated that there was to be a mandatory 10-year transition.[95] World wars and beyond (1890–present) Main articles: History of the Netherlands (1900–present), The Netherlands in World War I, and Netherlands in World War II Rotterdam after German air raids in 1940 The Netherlands was able to remain neutral during World War I, in part because the import of goods through the Netherlands proved essential to German survival until the blockade by the British Royal Navy in 1916.[96] That changed in World War II, when Nazi Germany invaded the Netherlands on 10 May 1940. The Rotterdam Blitz forced the main element of the Dutch army to surrender four days later. During the occupation, over 100,000 Dutch Jews[97] were rounded up and transported to Nazi extermination camps; only a few of them survived. Dutch workers were conscripted for forced labour in Germany, civilians who resisted were killed in reprisal for attacks on German soldiers, and the countryside was plundered for food. Although there were thousands of Dutch who risked their lives by hiding Jews from the Germans, over 20,000 Dutch fascists joined the Waffen SS,[98] fighting on the Eastern Front.[99] Political collaborators were members of the fascist NSB, the only legal political party in the occupied Netherlands. On 8 December 1941, the Dutch government-in-exile in London declared war on Japan,[100] but could not prevent the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies (Indonesia).[101] In 1944–45, the First Canadian Army, which included Canadian, British and Polish troops, was responsible for liberating much of the Netherlands.[102] Soon after VE Day, the Dutch fought a colonial war against the new Republic of Indonesia. Former Prime Ministers Wim Kok, Dries van Agt, Piet de Jong, Ruud Lubbers and Jan Peter Balkenende with Prime Minister Mark Rutte, in 2011 In 1954, the Charter for the Kingdom of the Netherlands reformed the political structure of the Netherlands, which was a result of international pressure to carry out decolonisation. The Dutch colonies of Surinam and Curaçao and Dependencies and the European country all became countries within the Kingdom, on a basis of equality. Indonesia had declared its independence in August 1945 (recognised in 1949), and thus was never part of the reformed Kingdom. Suriname followed in 1975. After the war, the Netherlands left behind an era of neutrality and gained closer ties with neighbouring states. The Netherlands was one of the founding members of the Benelux, the NATO, Euratom and the European Coal and Steel Community, which would evolve into the EEC (Common Market) and later the European Union. Government-encouraged emigration efforts to reduce population density prompted some 500,000 Dutch people to leave the country after the war.[103] The 1960s and 1970s were a time of great social and cultural change, such as rapid de-pillarisation characterised by the decay of the old divisions along political and religious lines. Youths, and students in particular, rejected traditional mores and pushed for change in matters such as women's rights, sexuality, disarmament and environmental issues. In 2002 the euro was introduced as fiat money, and in 2010 the Netherlands Antilles was dissolved. Referendums were held on each island to determine their future status. As a result, the islands of Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba (the BES islands) were to obtain closer ties with the Netherlands. This led to the incorporation of these three islands into the country of the Netherlands as special municipalities upon the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles. The special municipalities are collectively known as the Caribbean Netherlands. Geography Main article: Geography of the Netherlands See also: Low Countries Relief map of the European Netherlands According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, the European Netherlands has a total area of 41,545 km2 (16,041 sq mi), including water bodies; and a land area of 33,481 km2 (12,927 sq mi). The Caribbean Netherlands has a total area of 328 km2 (127 sq mi)[104] It lies between latitudes 50° and 54° N, and longitudes 3° and 8° E. The Netherlands is geographically very low relative to sea level and is considered a flat country, with about 26% of its area[27] and 21% of its population[105] located below sea level, and only about 50% of its land exceeding one metre above sea level.[106] The European part of the country is for the most part flat, with the exception of foothills in the far southeast, up to a height of no more than 321 metres, and some low hill ranges in the central parts. Most of the areas below sea level are man-made, caused by peat extraction or achieved through land reclamation. Since the late 16th century, large polder areas are preserved through elaborate drainage systems that include dikes, canals and pumping stations. Nearly 17% of the country's land area is reclaimed from the sea and from lakes. Much of the country was originally formed by the estuaries of three large European rivers: the Rhine (Rijn), the Meuse (Maas) and the Scheldt (Schelde), as well as their tributaries. The south-western part of the Netherlands is to this day a river delta of these three rivers, the Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt delta. The European Netherlands is divided into north and south parts by the Rhine, the Waal, its main tributary branch, and the Meuse. In the past, these rivers functioned as a natural barrier between fiefdoms and hence historically created a cultural divide, as is evident in some phonetic traits that are recognisable on either side of what the Dutch call their ""Great Rivers"" (de Grote Rivieren). Another significant branch of the Rhine, the IJssel river, discharges into Lake IJssel, the former Zuiderzee ('southern sea'). Just like the previous, this river forms a linguistic divide: people to the northeast of this river speak Dutch Low Saxon dialects (except for the province of Friesland, which has its own language).[107] Geology Main article: Geology of the Netherlands The modern Netherlands formed as a result of the interplay of the four main rivers (Rhine, Meuse, Schelde and IJssel) and the influence of the North Sea. The Netherlands is mostly composed of deltaic, coastal and eolian derived sediments during the Pleistocene glacial and interglacial periods. Almost the entire west Netherlands is composed of the Rhine-Meuse river estuary, but human intervention greatly modified the natural processes at work. Most of the western Netherlands is below sea level due to the human process of turning standing bodies of water into usable land, a polder. In the east of the Netherlands, remains are found of the last ice age, which ended approximately ten thousand years ago. As the continental ice sheet moved in from the north, it pushed moraine forward. The ice sheet halted as it covered the eastern half of the Netherlands. After the ice age ended, the moraine remained in the form of a long hill-line. The cities of Arnhem and Nijmegen are built upon these hills.[108] Floods Main articles: Flood control in the Netherlands, Floods in the Netherlands, North Sea flood of 1953, and Storm tides of the North Sea The Christmas flood of 1717 was the result of a northwesterly storm that resulted in the death of thousands. Over the centuries, the Dutch coastline has changed considerably as a result of natural disasters and human intervention. On 14 December 1287, St. Lucia's flood affected the Netherlands and Germany, killing more than 50,000 people in one of the most destructive floods in recorded history.[109] The St. Elizabeth flood of 1421 and the mismanagement in its aftermath destroyed a newly reclaimed polder, replacing it with the 72 km2 (28 sq mi) Biesbosch tidal floodplains in the south-centre. The huge North Sea flood of early February 1953 caused the collapse of several dikes in the south-west of the Netherlands; more than 1,800 people drowned in the flood. The Dutch government subsequently instituted a large-scale programme, the ""Delta Works"", to protect the country against future flooding, which was completed over a period of more than thirty years. Map illustrating areas of the Netherlands below sea level The impact of disasters was, to an extent, increased through human activity. Relatively high-lying swampland was drained to be used as farmland. The drainage caused the fertile peat to contract and ground levels to drop, upon which groundwater levels were lowered to compensate for the drop in ground level, causing the underlying peat to contract further. Additionally, until the 19th-century peat was mined, dried, and used for fuel, further exacerbating the problem. Centuries of extensive and poorly controlled peat extraction lowered an already low land surface by several metres. Even in flooded areas, peat extraction continued through turf dredging. Because of the flooding, farming was difficult, which encouraged foreign trade, the result of which was that the Dutch were involved in world affairs since the early 14th/15th century.[110] A polder at 5.53 metres below sea level To guard against floods, a series of defences against the water were contrived. In the first millennium AD, villages and farmhouses were built on man-made hills called terps. Later, these terps were connected by dikes. In the 12th century, local government agencies called ""waterschappen"" (""water boards"") or ""hoogheemraadschappen"" (""high home councils"") started to appear, whose job it was to maintain the water level and to protect a region from floods; these agencies continue to exist. As the ground level dropped, the dikes by necessity grew and merged into an integrated system. By the 13th century windmills had come into use to pump water out of areas below sea level. The windmills were later used to drain lakes, creating the famous polders.[111] In 1932 the Afsluitdijk (""Closure Dike"") was completed, blocking the former Zuiderzee (Southern Sea) from the North Sea and thus creating the IJsselmeer (IJssel Lake). It became part of the larger Zuiderzee Works in which four polders totalling 2,500 square kilometres (965 sq mi) were reclaimed from the sea.[112][113] The Netherlands is one of the countries that may suffer most from climate change. Not only is the rising sea a problem, but erratic weather patterns may cause the rivers to overflow.[114][115][116] Delta Works Main articles: Delta Works and Flood control in the Netherlands The Delta Works are located in the provinces of South Holland and Zeeland. Workum, Friesland Lisse, North Holland After the 1953 disaster, the Delta Works was constructed, which is a comprehensive set of civil works throughout the Dutch coast. The project started in 1958 and was largely completed in 1997 with the completion of the Maeslantkering. Since then, new projects have been periodically started to renovate and renew the Delta Works. The main goal of the Delta project was to reduce the risk of flooding in South Holland and Zeeland to once per 10,000 years (compared to once per 4000 years for the rest of the country). This was achieved by raising 3,000 km (1,900 mi) of outer sea-dikes and 10,000 km (6,200 mi) of the inner, canal, and river dikes, and by closing off the sea estuaries of the Zeeland province. New risk assessments occasionally show problems requiring additional Delta project dike reinforcements. The Delta project is considered by the American Society of Civil Engineers as one of the seven wonders of the modern world.[117] It is anticipated that global warming in the 21st century will result in a rise in sea level. The Netherlands is actively preparing for a sea-level rise. A politically neutral Delta Commission has formulated an action plan to cope with a sea-level rise of 1.10 m (4 ft) and a simultaneous land height decline of 10 cm (4 in). The plan encompasses the reinforcement of the existing coastal defences like dikes and dunes with 1.30 m (4.3 ft) of additional flood protection. Climate change will not only threaten the Netherlands from the seaside but could also alter rainfall patterns and river run-off. To protect the country from river flooding, another programme is already being executed. The Room for the River plan grants more flow space to rivers, protects the major populated areas and allows for periodic flooding of indefensible lands. The few residents who lived in these so-called ""overflow areas"" have been moved to higher ground, with some of that ground having been raised above anticipated flood levels.[118] Climate The predominant wind direction in the European Netherlands is southwest, which causes a mild maritime climate, with moderately warm summers and cool winters, and typically high humidity. This is especially true close to the Dutch coastline, where the difference in temperature between summer and winter, as well as between day and night is noticeably smaller than it is in the southeast of the country. Ice days—maximum temperature below 0 °C (32 °F)—usually occur from December until February, with the occasional rare ice day prior to or after that period. Freezing days—minimum temperature below 0 °C (32 °F)—occur much more often, usually ranging from mid-November to late March, but not rarely measured as early as mid-October and as late as mid-May. If one chooses the height of measurement to be 10 cm (4 in) above ground instead of 150 cm (59 in), one may even find such temperatures in the middle of the summer. On average, snow can occur from November to April but sometimes occurs in May or October too. Warm days—maximum temperature above 20 °C (68 °F)—are usually found in April to October, but in some parts of the country these warm days can also occur in March, or even sometimes in November or February (usually not in De Bilt, however). Summer days—maximum temperature above 25 °C (77 °F)—are usually measured in De Bilt from May until September, tropical days—maximum temperature above 30 °C (86 °F)—are rare and usually occur only in June to August. Precipitation throughout the year is distributed relatively equally each month. Summer and autumn months tend to gather a little more precipitation than the other months, mainly because of the intensity of the rainfall rather than the frequency of rain days (this is especially the case in summer when lightning is also much more frequent). The number of sunshine hours is affected by the fact that because of the geographical latitude, the length of the days varies between barely eight hours in December and nearly 17 hours in June. The following table are based on mean measurements by the KNMI weather station in De Bilt between 1991 and 2020. The highest recorded temperature was reached on 25 July 2019 in Gilze-Rijen.[119] Climate data for De Bilt (1991–2020 averages), all KNMI locations (1901–2021 extremes), snowy days: (2003-2020 averages).

(Our World in Data) Climate change in the Netherlands is already affecting the country. The average temperature in the Netherlands rose by almost 2 degrees Celsius from 1906 to 2017.[121] The Netherlands has the fourth largest CO2 emissions per capita of the European Union.[122] These changes have resulted in increased frequency of droughts and heatwaves. Because significant portions of the Netherlands have been reclaimed from the sea or otherwise are very near sea level, the Netherlands is very vulnerable to sea level rise. The Dutch government has set goals to lower emissions in the next few decades. The Dutch response to climate change is driven by a number of unique factors, including larger green recovery plans by the European Union in the face of the COVID-19 and a climate change litigation case, State of the Netherlands v. Urgenda Foundation, which created mandatory climate change mitigation through emissions reductions 25% below 1990 levels.[123][124] At the end of 2018 CO2 emissions were down 15% compared to 1990 levels.[125] The goal of the Dutch government is to reduce emissions in 2030 by 49%. Nature Further information: List of national parks of the Netherlands and List of extinct animals of the Netherlands The Netherlands has 20 national parks and hundreds of other nature reserves, that include lakes, heathland, woods, dunes, and other habitats. Most of these are owned by Staatsbosbeheer, the national department for forestry and nature conservation and Natuurmonumenten (literally 'Natures monuments'), a private organisation that buys, protects and manages nature reserves. The Dutch part of the Wadden Sea in the north, with its tidal flats and wetlands, is rich in biological diversity, and was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Nature Site in 2009. Common seals on Terschelling, a Wadden Sea island The Oosterschelde, formerly the northeast estuary of the river Scheldt was designated a national park in 2002, thereby making it the largest national park in the Netherlands at an area of 370 km2 (140 sq mi). It consists primarily of the salt waters of the Oosterschelde but also includes mudflats, meadows, and shoals. Because of the large variety of sea life, including unique regional species, the park is popular with Scuba divers. Other activities include sailing, fishing, cycling, and bird watching. Phytogeographically, the European Netherlands is shared between the Atlantic European and Central European provinces of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom. According to the World Wide Fund for Nature, the European territory of the Netherlands belongs to the ecoregion of Atlantic mixed forests.[126] In 1871, the last old original natural woods were cut down, and most woods today are planted monocultures of trees like Scots pine and trees that are not native to the Netherlands.[citation needed] These woods were planted on anthropogenic heaths and sand-drifts (overgrazed heaths) (Veluwe). The Netherlands had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 0.6/10, ranking it 169th globally out of 172 countries.[127] Caribbean islands Main articles: Bonaire, Saba, and Sint Eustatius While Curaçao, Aruba and Sint Maarten have a constituent country status, the Caribbean Netherlands are three islands designated as special municipalities of the Netherlands. The islands are part of the Lesser Antilles and have land borders with France (Saint Martin) and maritime borders with Anguilla, Curaçao, France (Saint Barthélemy), Saint Kitts and Nevis, Sint Maarten, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Venezuela.[21] Underwater life of Klein Bonaire Within this island group: Bonaire is part of the ABC islands within the Leeward Antilles island chain off the Venezuelan coast. The Leeward Antilles have a mixed volcanic and coral origin. Saba and Sint Eustatius are part of the SSS islands. They are located east of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Although in the English language they are considered part of the Leeward Islands, French, Spanish, Dutch and the English spoken locally consider them part of the Windward Islands. The Windward Islands are all of volcanic origin and hilly, leaving little ground suitable for agriculture. The highest point is Mount Scenery, 887 m (2,910 ft), on Saba. This is the highest point in the country and is also the highest point of the entire Kingdom of the Netherlands. The islands of the Caribbean Netherlands enjoy a tropical climate with warm weather all year round. The Leeward Antilles are warmer and drier than the Windward islands. In summer, the Windward Islands can be subject to hurricanes. Government and politics The Binnenhof, where the lower and upper houses of the States General meet The Netherlands has been a constitutional monarchy since 1815, and due to the efforts of Johan Rudolph Thorbecke[128] became a parliamentary democracy in 1848. The Netherlands is described as a consociational state. Dutch politics and governance are characterised by an effort to achieve broad consensus on important issues, within both the political community and society as a whole. In 2017, The Economist ranked the Netherlands as the 11th most democratic country in the world. The monarch is the head of state, at present King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands. Constitutionally, the position is equipped with limited powers. By law, the King has the right to be periodically briefed and consulted on government affairs. Depending on the personalities and relationships of the King and the ministers, the monarch might have influence beyond the power granted by the Constitution of the Netherlands. Willem-AlexanderKing since 2013Mark Rutte Prime Ministersince 2010 The executive power is formed by the Council of Ministers, the deliberative organ of the Dutch cabinet. The cabinet usually consists of 13 to 16 ministers and a varying number of state secretaries. One to three ministers are ministers without portfolio. The head of government is the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, who often is the leader of the largest party of the coalition. The Prime Minister is a primus inter pares, with no explicit powers beyond those of the other ministers. Mark Rutte has been Prime Minister since October 2010; the Prime Minister had been the leader of the largest party of the governing coalition continuously since 1973. The cabinet is responsible to the bicameral parliament, the States General, which also has legislative powers. The 150 members of the House of Representatives, the lower house, are elected in direct elections on the basis of party-list proportional representation. These are held every four years, or sooner in case the cabinet falls (for example: when one of the chambers carries a motion of no confidence, the cabinet offers its resignation to the monarch). The States-Provincial are directly elected every four years as well. The members of the provincial assemblies elect the 75 members of the Senate, the upper house, which has the power to reject laws, but not propose or amend them. Both houses send members to the Benelux Parliament, a consultative council. Political culture De Wallen, Amsterdam's red-light district, offers activities such as legal prostitution and a number of coffee shops that sell marijuana, symbolising the Dutch political culture and tradition of tolerance. Both trade unions and employers organisations are consulted beforehand in policymaking in the financial, economic and social areas. They meet regularly with the government in the Social-Economic Council. This body advises government and its advice cannot be put aside easily. The Netherlands has a long tradition of social tolerance.[129] In the 18th century, while the Dutch Reformed Church was the state religion, Catholicism, other forms of Protestantism, such as Baptists and Lutherans, as well as Judaism were tolerated but discriminated against.[citation needed] In the late 19th century this Dutch tradition of religious tolerance transformed into a system of pillarisation, in which religious groups coexisted separately and only interacted at the level of government. This tradition of tolerance influences Dutch criminal justice policies on recreational drugs, prostitution, LGBT rights, euthanasia, and abortion, which are among the most liberal in the world. Political parties Main articles: Political parties of the Netherlands and Politics of the Netherlands The Netherlands has a culture of respectful and friendly debate. From left to right, members of the House of Representatives Sander de Rouwe (CDA), Ineke van Gent (GL), Han ten Broeke (VVD), Kees Verhoeven (D66) and Farshad Bashir (SP), 2010 Because of the multi-party system, no single party has held a majority in parliament since the 19th century, as a result, coalition cabinets had to be formed. Since suffrage became universal in 1917, the Dutch political system has been dominated by three families of political parties: the strongest of which were the Christian Democrats, currently represented by the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA); second were the Social Democrats, represented by the Labour Party (PvdA); and third were the Liberals, of which the right-wing People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) is the main representative. These parties co-operated in coalition cabinets in which the Christian Democrats had always been a partner: so either a centre-left coalition of the Christian Democrats and Social Democrats was ruling or a centre-right coalition of Christian Democrats and Liberals. In the 1970s, the party system became more volatile: the Christian Democratic parties lost seats, while new parties became successful, such as the radical democrat and progressive liberal Democrats 66 (D66) or the ecologist party GroenLinks (GL). In the 1994 election, the CDA lost its dominant position. A ""purple"" cabinet was formed by the VVD, D66, and PvdA. In the 2002 elections, this cabinet lost its majority, because of an increased support for the CDA and the rise of the right-wing LPF, a new political party, around Pim Fortuyn, who was assassinated a week before the elections. A short-lived cabinet was formed by CDA, VVD, and LPF, which was led by the CDA Leader Jan Peter Balkenende. After the 2003 elections, in which the LPF lost most of its seats, a cabinet was formed by the CDA, VVD, and D66. The cabinet initiated an ambitious programme of reforming the welfare state, the healthcare system, and immigration policy. In June 2006, the cabinet fell after D66 voted in favour of a motion of no confidence against the Minister of Immigration and Integration, Rita Verdonk, who had instigated an investigation of the asylum procedure of Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a VVD MP. A caretaker cabinet was formed by the CDA and VVD, and general elections were held on 22 November 2006. In these elections, the CDA remained the largest party and the Socialist Party made the largest gains. The formation of a new cabinet took three months, resulting in a coalition of CDA, PvdA, and Christian Union. On 20 February 2010, the cabinet fell when the PvdA refused to prolong the involvement of the Dutch Army in Uruzgan, Afghanistan.[130] Snap elections were held on 9 June 2010, with devastating results for the previously largest party, the CDA, which lost about half of its seats, resulting in 21 seats. The VVD became the largest party with 31 seats, closely followed by the PvdA with 30 seats. The big winner of the 2010 elections was Geert Wilders, whose right wing PVV,[131][132] the ideological successor to the LPF, more than doubled its number of seats.[133] Negotiation talks for a new government resulted in a minority government, led by VVD (a first) in coalition with CDA, which was sworn in on 14 October 2010. This unprecedented minority government was supported by PVV, but proved ultimately to be unstable,[134] when on 21 April 2012, Wilders, leader of PVV, unexpectedly 'torpedoed seven weeks of austerity talks' on new austerity measures, paving the way for early elections.[135][136][137] VVD and PvdA won a majority in the House of Representatives during the 2012 general election. On 5 November 2012 they formed the second Rutte cabinet. After the 2017 general election, VVD, Christian Democratic Appeal, Democrats 66 and ChristenUnie formed the third Rutte cabinet. This cabinet resigned in January 2021, two months before the general election, after a child welfare fraud scandal.[138] In March 2021, centre-right VVD of Prime Minister Mark Rutte was the winner of the elections, securing 35 out of 150 seats. The second biggest party was the centre-left D66 with 24 seats. Geert Wilders' far-right party lost its support. Prime Minister Mark Rutte, in power since 2010, formed his fourth coalition government.[139] Government Main article: Government of the Netherlands Administrative divisions Main articles: Administrative divisions of the Netherlands and Public body (Netherlands) Provinces and territories of the Netherlands The Netherlands is divided into twelve provinces, each under a King's Commissioner (Commissaris van de Koning). Informally in Limburg province this position is named Governor (Gouverneur). All provinces are divided into municipalities (gemeenten), of which there are 352 (2021).[140][141] The country is also subdivided into 21 water districts, governed by a water board (waterschap or hoogheemraadschap), each having authority in matters concerning water management.[142][143] The creation of water boards actually pre-dates that of the nation itself, the first appearing in 1196. The Dutch water boards are among the oldest democratic entities in the world still in existence. Direct elections of the water boards take place every four years. The administrative structure on the three BES islands, collectively known as the Caribbean Netherlands, is outside the twelve provinces. These islands have the status of openbare lichamen (public bodies).[144] In the Netherlands these administrative units are often referred to as special municipalities. The Netherlands has several Belgian exclaves[145] and within those even several enclaves which are part of the province of North Brabant. Because the Netherlands and Belgium are both in the Benelux, and more recently in the Schengen Area, citizens of respective countries can travel through these enclaves without controls.

Since World War II, the Netherlands has become a member of a large number of international organisations, most prominently the UN, NATO and the EU. The Dutch economy is very open and relies strongly on international trade. The foreign policy of the Netherlands is based on four basic commitments: to Atlantic co-operation, to European integration, to international development and to international law. One of the more controversial international issues surrounding the Netherlands is its liberal policy towards soft drugs. During and after the Dutch Golden Age, the Dutch people built up a commercial and colonial empire. The most important colonies were present-day Suriname and Indonesia. Indonesia became independent after the Indonesian National Revolution in the 1940s following a war of independence, international pressure and several United Nations Security Council resolutions. Suriname became independent in 1975. The historical ties inherited from its colonial past still influence the foreign relations of the Netherlands. In addition, many people from these countries are living permanently in the Netherlands. Military Main article: Armed forces of the Netherlands Lieutenant admiral Rob Bauer is the current Chief of Defence. The Netherlands has one of the oldest standing armies in Europe; it was first established as such by Maurice of Nassau in the late 1500s. The Dutch army was used throughout the Dutch Empire. After the defeat of Napoleon, the Dutch army was transformed into a conscription army. The army was unsuccessfully deployed during the Belgian Revolution in 1830. After 1830, it was deployed mainly in the Dutch colonies, as the Netherlands remained neutral in European wars (including the First World War), until the Netherlands was invaded in World War II and defeated by the Wehrmacht in May 1940. Zr. Ms. Holland, a Royal Netherlands Navy offshore patrol vessel The Netherlands abandoned its neutrality in 1948 when it signed the Treaty of Brussels, and became a founding member of NATO in 1949. The Dutch military was therefore part of the NATO strength in Cold War Europe, deploying its army to several bases in Germany. More than 3,000 Dutch soldiers were assigned to the 2nd Infantry Division of the United States Army during the Korean War. In 1996 conscription was suspended, and the Dutch army was once again transformed into a professional army. Since the 1990s the Dutch army has been involved in the Bosnian War and the Kosovo War, it held a province in Iraq after the defeat of Saddam Hussein, and it was engaged in Afghanistan. The military is composed of four branches, all of which carry the prefix Koninklijke (Royal): Koninklijke Marine (KM), the Royal Netherlands Navy, including the Naval Air Service and Marine Corps; Koninklijke Landmacht (KL), the Royal Netherlands Army; Koninklijke Luchtmacht (KLu), the Royal Netherlands Air Force; Koninklijke Marechaussee (KMar), the Royal Marechaussee (Military Police), tasks include military police and border control. The submarine service opened to women on 1 January 2017. The Korps Commandotroepen, the Special Operations Force of the Netherlands Army, is open to women, but because of the extremely high physical demands for initial training, it is almost impossible for a woman to become a commando.[148] The Dutch Ministry of Defence employs more than 70,000 personnel, including over 20,000 civilians and over 50,000 military personnel.[149] In April 2011 the government announced a major reduction in its military because of a cut in government expenditure, including a decrease in the number of tanks, fighter aircraft, naval ships and senior officials.[150] The Netherlands has ratified many international conventions concerning war law. The Netherlands decided not to sign the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.[151] Economy Main article: Economy of the Netherlands A proportional representation of Netherlands exports, 2019 The Port of Rotterdam is Europe's largest port. The Netherlands has a developed economy and has been playing a special role in the European economy for many centuries. Since the 16th century, shipping, fishing, agriculture, trade, and banking have been leading sectors of the Dutch economy. The Netherlands has a high level of economic freedom. The Netherlands is one of the top countries in the Global Enabling Trade Report (2nd in 2016), and was ranked the fifth most competitive economy in the world by the Swiss International Institute for Management Development in 2017.[152] In addition, the country was ranked the second most innovative nation in the world in the 2018 Global Innovation Index.[153] The Netherlands is a heavily developed country. Shown here is a motorway passing by a polder with a drainage windmill, and two wind turbines in the background. As of 2020[update], the key trading partners of the Netherlands were Germany, Belgium, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Italy, China and Russia.[154] The Netherlands is one of the world's 10 leading exporting countries. Foodstuffs form the largest industrial sector. Other major industries include chemicals, metallurgy, machinery, electrical goods, trade, services and tourism. Examples of international Dutch companies operating in Netherlands include Randstad, Unilever, Heineken, KLM, financial services (ING, ABN AMRO, Rabobank), chemicals (DSM, AKZO), petroleum refining (Royal Dutch Shell), electronical machinery (Philips, ASML), and satellite navigation (TomTom). The Netherlands has the 17th-largest economy in the world, and ranks 11th in GDP (nominal) per capita. Between 1997 and 2000 annual economic growth (GDP) averaged nearly 4%, well above the European average. Growth slowed considerably from 2001 to 2005 with the global economic slowdown, but accelerated to 4.1% in the third quarter of 2007. In May 2013, inflation was at 2.8% per year.[155] In April 2013, unemployment was at 8.2% (or 6.7% following the ILO definition) of the labour force.[156] In February 2019, this was reduced to 3.4%.[157] In Q3 and Q4 2011, the Dutch economy contracted by 0.4% and 0.7%, respectively, because of European Debt Crisis, while in Q4 the Eurozone economy shrunk by 0.3%.[158] The Netherlands also has a relatively low GINI coefficient of 0.326. Despite ranking 11th in GDP per capita, UNICEF ranked the Netherlands 1st in child well-being in rich countries, both in 2007 and in 2013.[159][160][161] On the Index of Economic Freedom Netherlands is the 14th most free market capitalist economy out of 180 surveyed countries. Amsterdam is the financial and business capital of the Netherlands.[162] The Amsterdam Stock Exchange (AEX), part of Euronext, is the world's oldest stock exchange and is one of Europe's largest bourses. It is situated near Dam Square in the city's centre. As a founding member of the euro, the Netherlands replaced (for accounting purposes) its former currency, the ""gulden"" (guilder), on 1 January 1999, along with 15 other adopters of the euro. Actual euro coins and banknotes followed on 1 January 2002. One euro was equivalent to 2.20371 Dutch guilders. In the Caribbean Netherlands, the United States dollar is used instead of the euro. The Netherlands is part of a monetary union, the Eurozone (dark blue), and the EU single market. The Dutch location gives it prime access to markets in the UK and Germany, with the Port of Rotterdam being the largest port in Europe. Other important parts of the economy are international trade (Dutch colonialism started with co-operative private enterprises such as the Dutch East India Company), banking and transport. The Netherlands successfully addressed the issue of public finances and stagnating job growth long before its European partners. Amsterdam is the 5th-busiest tourist destination in Europe with more than 4.2 million international visitors.[163] Since the enlargement of the EU large numbers of migrant workers have arrived in the Netherlands from Central and Eastern Europe.[164] The Netherlands continues to be one of the leading European nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the five largest investors in the United States. The economy experienced a slowdown in 2005, but in 2006 recovered to the fastest pace in six years on the back of increased exports and strong investment. The pace of job growth reached 10-year highs in 2007. The Netherlands is the fourth-most competitive economy in the world, according to the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report.[165] Natural gas Natural gas concessions in the Netherlands. Today the Netherlands accounts for more than 25% of all natural gas reserves in the EU. Beginning in the 1950s, the Netherlands discovered huge natural gas resources. The sale of natural gas generated enormous revenues for the Netherlands for decades, adding hundreds of billions of euros to the government's budget.[166] However, the unforeseen consequences of the country's huge energy wealth impacted the competitiveness of other sectors of the economy, leading to the theory of Dutch disease.[166] The Groningen gas field whose discovery in 1959 transformed the Dutch economy, generating €159 billion in revenue since the mid-1970s. Apart from coal and gas, the country has no mining resources. The last coal mine was closed in 1974. The Groningen gas field, one of the largest natural-gas fields in the world, is situated near Slochteren. The exploitation of this field has resulted in €159 billion in revenue since the mid-1970s.[167] The field is operated by government-owned Gasunie and output is jointly exploited by the government, Royal Dutch Shell, and Exxon Mobil through NAM (Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij). ""Gas extraction has resulted in increasingly strong earth tremors, some measuring as much as 3.6 on the Richter magnitude scale. The cost of damage repairs, structural improvements to buildings, and compensation for home value decreases has been estimated at €6.5 billion. Around 35,000 homes are said to be affected.""[168] The Netherlands has an estimated 25% of natural gas reserves in the EU.[169] The energy sector accounted for almost 11% of the GDP in 2014.[170] Netherlands' economy, mainly due to the large shares of natural gas reserves, is considered to have ""very high"" energy intensity rating.[171] The Netherlands is faced with future challenges as the energy supply is forecasted to fall short of the demand by the year 2025 in the gas sector. This is attributed to the depletion of the Netherlands' major gas field, Groningen, and the earthquakes that have hit the Groningen region.[172] In addition, there is ambiguity surrounding the feasibility of producing unconventional gas. The Netherlands relies heavily on natural gas to provide energy. Gas is the main source of heating for households in the Netherlands[169] and represented 35% of the energy mix in 2014.[173] Furthermore, The European Union 2020 package (20% reduction in GHG emissions, 20% renewables in the energy mix and 20% improvement in energy efficiency) enacted in 2009 has influenced the domestic energy politics of Netherlands and pressured non-state actors to give consent to more aggressive energy reforms that would reduce reliance on natural resources as a source of income to the economy.[174] Therefore, a transition towards renewable energy has been a key objective by Netherlands in order to safeguard the energy security of the country from natural resources depletion, mainly gas.[169] Netherlands has set a 14% renewable energy target of the total energy mix by the year 2020.[175] However, the continuation of providing tax breaks to electricity generated by coal and gas, and to the exploration and extraction of gas from fields that are ""insufficiently"" profitable,[176] renders a successful transition towards renewable energy more difficult to achieve due to inconsistencies in the policy mix. In 2011, it was estimated that the renewable energy sector received 31% (EUR 743MM), while the conventional energy sector received 69% (EUR 1.6B), of the total energy subsidies by the government.[176] Furthermore, the energy market in the Netherlands remains to be dominated by few major corporations Nuon, RWE, E.ON, Eneco, and Delta that have significant influence over the energy policy.[177] Renewable energy share in the energy mix is estimated to reach 12.4% by the year 2020, falling 1.6% short of the 14% target.[175][needs update] Agriculture and natural resources Cows near the city of Arnhem From a biological resource perspective, the Netherlands has a low endowment: the Netherlands’ biocapacity adds up to only 0.8 global hectares in 2016, 0.2 of which are dedicated to agriculture.[178] The Dutch biocapacity per person is just about half of the 1.6 global hectares of biocapacity per person available worldwide.[179] In contrast, in 2016, the Dutch used on average 4.8 global hectares of biocapacity - their ecological footprint of consumption. This means the Dutch required nearly six times as much biocapacity as the Netherlands contains. As a result, the Netherlands was running a biocapacity deficit of 4.0 global hectares per person in 2016.[178] The Dutch agricultural sector is highly mechanised, and has a strong focus on international exports. It employs about 4% of the Dutch labour force but produces large surpluses in the food-processing industry and accounts for 21% of the Dutch total export value.[180] The Dutch rank first in the European Union and second worldwide in value of agricultural exports, behind only the United States,[181] with agricultural exports earning €80.7 billion in 2014,[182] up from €75.4 billion in 2012.[30] In 2019 agricultural exports were worth €94.5 billion.[183] One-third of the world's exports of chilis, tomatoes, and cucumbers goes through the country. The Netherlands also exports one-fifteenth of the world's apples.[184] Aside from that, a significant portion of Dutch agricultural exports consists of fresh-cut plants, flowers, and flower bulbs, with the Netherlands exporting two-thirds of the world's total.[184] Demographics Main article: Demography of the Netherlands Population of the Netherlands from 1900 to 2000 The Netherlands had an estimated population of 17,493,969 as of 30 April 2021.[146] It is the 5th most densely populated country in Europe, and except for the very small city-states like Monaco, Vatican City and San Marino it is the most densely populated country in Europe. And it is the 16th most densely populated country in the world with a density of 424 per square kilometre (1,100/sq mi). It is the 67th most populous country in the world. Between 1900 and 1950, the country's population almost doubled from 5.1 to 10 million. From 1950 to 2000, the population further increased, to 15.9 million, though this represented a lower rate of population growth.[185] The estimated growth rate in 2013[update] is 0.44%.[186] Population pyramid of the Netherlands in 2017 The fertility rate in the Netherlands is 1.78 children per woman (2018 estimate),[186] which is high compared with many other European countries, but below the rate of 2.1 children per woman required for natural population replacement, it remains considerably below the high of 5.39 children born per woman in 1879.[187] Netherlands subsequently has one of the oldest populations in the world, with the average age of 42.7 years.[186] Life expectancy is high in the Netherlands: 84.3 years for newborn girls and 79.7 for boys (2020 estimate).[186] The country has a migration rate of 1.9 migrants per 1,000 inhabitants per year.[186] The majority of the population of the Netherlands is ethnically Dutch. According to a 2005 estimate, the population was 80.9% Dutch, 2.4% Indonesian, 2.4% German, 2.2% Turkish, 2.0% Surinamese, 1.9% Moroccan, 0.8% Antillean and Aruban, and 7.4% others.[188] Some 150,000 to 200,000 people living in the Netherlands are expatriates, mostly concentrated in and around Amsterdam and The Hague, now constituting almost 10% of the population of these cities.[189][190] The Dutch are the tallest people in the world, by nationality,[191] with an average height of 1.81 metres (5 ft 11.3 in) for adult males and 1.67 metres (5 ft 5.7 in) for adult females in 2009.[192] People in the south are on average about 2 cm (0.8 inches) shorter than those in the north. In Rotterdam almost half the population has an immigrant background. According to Eurostat, in 2010 there were 1.8 million foreign-born residents in the Netherlands, corresponding to 11.1% of the total population. Of these, 1.4 million (8.5%) were born outside the EU and 0.43 million (2.6%) were born in another EU Member State.[193] On 21 November 2016, there were 3.8 million residents in the Netherlands with at least one foreign-born parent (""migration background"").[194] Over half the young people in Amsterdam and Rotterdam have a non-western background.[195] Dutch people, or descendants of Dutch people, are also found in migrant communities worldwide, notably in Canada, Australia, South Africa and the United States. According to the United States Census Bureau (2006), more than 5 million Americans claim total or partial Dutch ancestry.[196] There are close to 3 million Dutch-descended Afrikaners living in South Africa.[197] In 1940, there were 290,000 Europeans and Eurasians in Indonesia,[198] but most have since left the country.[199] The Randstad is the country's largest conurbation located in the west of the country and contains the four largest cities: Amsterdam in the province North Holland, Rotterdam and The Hague in the province South Holland, and Utrecht in the province Utrecht. The Randstad has a population of about 8.2 million inhabitants[200] and is the 5th largest metropolitan area in Europe. According to Dutch Central Statistics Bureau, in 2015, 28 per cent of the Dutch population had a spendable income above 45,000 euros (which does not include spending on health care or education).[201] vte Largest municipalities in the NetherlandsStatistics Netherlands[202] Rank Name Province Pop.

Besides Dutch, West Frisian is recognised as a second official language in the northern province of Friesland (Fryslân in West Frisian).[205] West Frisian has a formal status for government correspondence in that province. In the European part of the kingdom two other regional languages are recognised under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.[206] The first of these recognised regional languages is Low Saxon (Nedersaksisch in Dutch). Low Saxon consists of several dialects spoken in the north and east, like Tweants in the region of Twente, and Drents in the province of Drenthe. Secondly, Limburgish is also recognised as a regional language. It consists of Dutch varieties of Meuse-Rhenish Franconian languages and is spoken in the south-eastern province of Limburg.[107] The dialects most spoken in the Netherlands are the Brabantian-Hollandic dialects.[207] Ripuarian language, which is spoken in Kerkrade and Vaals in the form of, respectively, the Kerkrade dialect and the Vaals dialect[208][209] are legally treated as Limburgish as well - see Southeast Limburgish dialect. English has a formal status in the special municipalities of Saba and Sint Eustatius. It is widely spoken on these islands. Papiamento has a formal status in the special municipality of Bonaire. Yiddish and the Romani language were recognised in 1996 as non-territorial languages.[210] The Netherlands has a tradition of learning foreign languages, formalised in Dutch education laws. Some 90% of the total population indicate they are able to converse in English, 70% in German, and 29% in French.[211] English is a mandatory course in all secondary schools.[212] In most lower level secondary school educations (vmbo), one additional modern foreign language is mandatory during the first two years.[213] In higher level secondary schools (HAVO and VWO), the acquisition of two additional modern foreign language skills is mandatory during the first three years. Only during the last three years in VWO one foreign language is mandatory. Besides English, the standard modern languages are French and German, although schools can replace one of these modern languages with Chinese, Spanish, Russian, Italian, Turkish or Arabic.[214] Additionally, schools in Friesland teach and have exams in West Frisian, and schools across the country teach and have exams in Ancient Greek and Latin for secondary school (called Gymnasium or VWO+). Religion Main article: Religion in the Netherlands Religious identification in the Netherlands (2019)[4] Irreligious (54.1%)  Catholic (20.1%)  Protestant (14.8%)  Muslim (5.0%)  Other (5.9%) The population of the Netherlands was predominantly Christian until the late 20th century, divided into a number of denominations. Although significant religious diversity remains, there has been a decline of religious adherence. The Netherlands is now one of the most secular societies in the world. In 2019, Statistics Netherlands found that 54.1% of the total population declared itself to be non-religious. Groups that represent the non-religious in the Netherlands include Humanistisch Verbond. Catholics comprised 20.1% of the total population, Protestants (14.8%). Muslims comprised 5.0% of the total population and followers of other Christian denominations and other religions (like Judaism, Buddhism and Hinduism) comprised the remaining 5.9%.[4] A 2015 survey from another source found that Protestants outnumbered Catholics.[215] The southern provinces of North Brabant and Limburg have historically been strongly Catholic, and some residents consider the Catholic Church as a base for their cultural identity. Protestantism in the Netherlands consists of a number of churches within various traditions. The largest of these is the Protestant Church in the Netherlands (PKN), a united church which is Calvinist and Lutheran in orientation.[216] It was formed in 2004 as a merger of the Dutch Reformed Church, the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands and a smaller Lutheran Church. Several orthodox Calvinist and liberal churches did not merge into the PKN. Although in the Netherlands as a whole Christianity has become a minority, the Netherlands contains a Bible Belt from Zeeland to the northern parts of the province Overijssel, in which Protestant (particularly Calvinist) beliefs remain strong, and even has majorities in municipal councils. Islam is the second largest religion in the state. In 2012, there were about 825,000 Muslims in the Netherlands (5% of the population).[217] The Muslim population increased from the 1960 as a result of large numbers of migrant workers. This included migrant workers from Turkey and Morocco, as well as migrants from former Dutch colonies, such as Surinam and Indonesia. During the 1990s, Muslim refugees arrived from countries like Bosnia and Herzegovina, Iran, Iraq, Somalia, and Afghanistan.[218] Another religion practised is Hinduism, with around 215,000 adherents (slightly over 1% of the population). Most of these are Indo-Surinamese. There are also sizable populations of Hindu immigrants from India and Sri Lanka, and some Western adherents of Hinduism-oriented new religious movements such as Hare Krishnas. The Netherlands has an estimated 250,000 Buddhists or people strongly attracted to this religion, mainly ethnic Dutch people. In addition, there are about 45,000 Jews in the Netherlands. The Constitution of the Netherlands guarantees freedom of education, which means that all schools that adhere to general quality criteria receive the same government funding. This includes schools based on religious principles by religious groups (especially Catholic and various Protestant). Three political parties in the Dutch parliament, (CDA, and two small parties, ChristianUnion and SGP) are based upon the Christian belief. Several Christian religious holidays are national holidays (Christmas, Easter, Pentecost and the Ascension of Jesus).[219] Upon the country's independence, Protestants were predominant in most of the country, while Roman Catholics were dominant in the south, especially North Brabant and Limburg. In the late 19th century, secularism, atheism and pillarisation gained adherents. By 1960, Catholics equalled Protestants in number; thereafter, both Christian branches began to decline. Conversely, Islam grew considerably as the result of immigration. Since 2000 there has been raised awareness of religion, mainly due to Muslim extremism.[220] The Dutch royal family has been traditionally associated with Calvinism, specifically the Dutch Reformed Church, which has merged into the Protestant Church in the Netherlands. The Dutch Reformed Church was the only major Protestant church in the Netherlands from the Reformation until the 19th century. Denominational splits in 1834 and in 1886 diversified Dutch Calvinism. In 2013, a Catholic became Queen consort. A survey in December 2014 concluded that for the first time there were more atheists (25%) than theists (17%) in the Netherlands, while the remainder of the population was agnostic (31%) or ietsistic (27%).[221] In 2015, a vast majority of the inhabitants of the Netherlands (82%) said they had never or almost never visited a church, and 59% stated that they had never been to a church of any kind. Of all the people questioned, 24% saw themselves as atheist, an increase of 11% compared to the previous study done in 2006.[222] The expected rise of spirituality (ietsism) has come to a halt according to research in 2015. In 2006, 40% of respondents considered themselves spiritual; in 2015 this has dropped to 31%. The number who believed in the existence of a higher power fell from 36% to 28% over the same period.[223] Education Main articles: Education in the Netherlands and Universities in the Netherlands An international primary school in The Hague View on the Utrecht Science Park of Utrecht University. The building in the centre is the library. Education in the Netherlands is compulsory between the ages of 5 and 16. If a child does not have a ""starting qualification"" (HAVO, VWO or MBO 2+ degree) they are still forced to attend classes until they achieve such a qualification or reach the age of 18.[224] All children in the Netherlands usually attend elementary school from (on average) ages 4 to 12. It comprises eight grades, the first of which is facultative. Based on an aptitude test, the eighth grade teacher's recommendation and the opinion of the pupil's parents or caretakers, a choice is made for one of the three main streams of secondary education. After completing a particular stream, a pupil may still continue in the penultimate year of the next stream. The VMBO has four grades and is subdivided over several levels. Successfully completing the VMBO results in a low-level vocational degree that grants access to the MBO. The MBO (middle-level applied education) is a form of education that primarily focuses on teaching a practical trade or a vocational degree. With the MBO certification, a student can apply for the HBO. The HAVO has 5 grades and allows for admission to the HBO. The HBO (higher professional education) are universities of professional education (applied sciences) that award professional bachelor's degrees; similar to polytechnic degrees. An HBO degree gives access to the university system. The VWO (comprising atheneum and gymnasium) has 6 grades and prepares for studying at a research university. Universities offer a three-year bachelor's degree, followed by a one or two-year master's degree, which in turn can be followed by a four or five-year doctoral degree programme. Doctoral candidates in the Netherlands are generally non-tenured employees of a university. All Dutch schools and universities are publicly funded and managed with the exception of religious schools that are publicly funded but not managed by the state even though requirements are necessary for the funding to be authorised. Dutch universities have a tuition fee of about 2,000 euros a year for students from the Netherlands and the European Union. The amount is about 10,000 euros for non-EU students. Healthcare Main article: Healthcare in the Netherlands Portrait of Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632–1723), known as ""the father of microbiology"" A public hospital in Amersfoort In 2016, the Netherlands maintained its number one position at the top of the annual Euro health consumer index (EHCI), which compares healthcare systems in Europe, scoring 916 of a maximum 1,000 points. The Netherlands has been among the top three countries in each report published since 2005. On 48 indicators such as patient rights and information, accessibility, prevention and outcomes, the Netherlands secured its top position among 37 European countries for six years in a row.[225] The Netherlands was ranked first in a study in 2009 comparing the health care systems of the United States, Australia, Canada, Germany and New Zealand.[226][227] Ever since a major reform of the health care system in 2006, the Dutch system received more points in the Index each year. According to the HCP (Health Consumer Powerhouse), the Netherlands has 'a chaos system', meaning patients have a great degree of freedom from where to buy their health insurance, to where they get their healthcare service. The difference between the Netherlands and other countries is that the chaos is managed. Healthcare decisions are being made in a dialogue between the patients and healthcare professionals.[228] Health insurance in the Netherlands is mandatory. Healthcare in the Netherlands is covered by two statutory forms of insurance: Zorgverzekeringswet (ZVW), often called ""basic insurance"", covers common medical care. Algemene Wet Bijzondere Ziektekosten (AWBZ) covers long-term nursing and care. While Dutch residents are automatically insured by the government for AWBZ, everyone has to take out their own basic healthcare insurance (basisverzekering), except those under 18 who are automatically covered under their parents' premium. If a person decides not to carry out an insurance coverage, the person may be fined. Insurers have to offer a universal package for everyone over the age of 18 years, regardless of age or state of health – it's illegal to refuse an application or impose special conditions. In contrast to many other European systems, the Dutch government is responsible for the accessibility and quality of the healthcare system in the Netherlands, but not in charge of its management. Healthcare in the Netherlands can be divided in several ways: three echelons, in somatic and mental health care and in 'cure' (short term) and 'care' (long term). Home doctors (huisartsen, comparable to general practitioners) form the largest part of the first echelon. Being referenced by a member of the first echelon is mandatory for access to the second and third echelon.[229] The health care system is in comparison to other Western countries quite effective but not the most cost-effective.[230] Healthcare in the Netherlands is financed by a dual system that came into effect in January 2006. Long-term treatments, especially those that involve semi-permanent hospitalisation, and also disability costs such as wheelchairs, are covered by a state-controlled mandatory insurance. This is laid down in the Algemene Wet Bijzondere Ziektekosten (""General Law on Exceptional Healthcare Costs"") which first came into effect in 1968. In 2009 this insurance covered 27% of all health care expenses.[231] For all regular (short-term) medical treatment, there is a system of obligatory health insurance, with private health insurance companies. These insurance companies are obliged to provide a package with a defined set of insured treatments.[232] This insurance covers 41% of all health care expenses.[231] Other sources of health care payment are taxes (14%), out of pocket payments (9%), additional optional health insurance packages (4%) and a range of other sources (4%).[231] Affordability is guaranteed through a system of income-related allowances and individual and employer-paid income-related premiums. A key feature of the Dutch system is that premiums may not be related to health status or age. Risk variances between private health insurance companies due to the different risks presented by individual policy holders are compensated through risk equalisation and a common risk pool. The funding burden for all short-term health care coverage is carried 50% by employers, 45% by the insured person and 5% by the government. Children under 18 are covered for free. Those on low incomes receive compensation to help them pay their insurance. Premiums paid by the insured are about €100 per month (about US$127 in August 2010 and €150 or US$196 in 2012), with variation of about 5% between the various competing insurers, and a yearly deductible of €220 (US$288). Transport Main article: Transport in the Netherlands Mobility on Dutch roads has grown continuously since the 1950s and now exceeds 200 billion km travelled per year,[233] three quarters of which are done by car.[234] Around half of all trips in the Netherlands are made by car, 25% by bicycle, 20% walking, and 5% by public transport.[234] Road transport A1 motorway, in Gelderland With a total road network of 139,295 km, which includes 2,758 km of expressways,[235] the Netherlands has one of the densest road networks in the world—much denser than Germany and France, but still not as dense as Belgium.[236] As part of its commitment to environmental sustainability, the Government of the Netherlands initiated a plan to establish over 200 recharging stations for electric vehicles across the country. The rollout will be undertaken by Switzerland-based power and automation company ABB and Dutch startup Fastned, and will aim to provide at least one station within a 50-kilometre radius (30 miles) from every home in the Netherlands.[237] Currently, the Netherlands alone hosts more than a quarter of all recharging stations in the European Union.[238] This share rises to 30% if Brexit is taken into account. Moreover, newly sold cars in the Netherlands have on average the lowest CO2 emissions in the EU.[239] Public transport A regional train operated by Nederlandse Spoorwegen (NS) About 13% of all distance is travelled by public transport, the majority of which by train.[234] Like in many other European countries, the Dutch rail network of 3,013 km route is also rather dense.[240] The network is mostly focused on passenger rail services and connects all major towns and cities, with over 400 stations. Trains are frequent, with two trains per hour on lesser lines,[k] two to four trains per hour on average, and up to eight trains an hour on the busiest lines.[241] The Dutch national train network also includes the HSL-Zuid, a high-speed line between the Amsterdam metropolitan area and the Belgian border for trains running from Paris and London to the Netherlands. Cycling Main article: Cycling in the Netherlands Bike passage at Rotterdam Centraal station Cycling is a ubiquitous mode of transport in the Netherlands. Almost as many kilometres are covered by bicycle as by train.[234] The Dutch are estimated to have at least 18 million bicycles,[242][243] which makes more than one per capita, and twice as many as the circa 9 million motor vehicles on the road.[244] In 2013, the European Cyclists' Federation ranked both the Netherlands and Denmark as the most bike-friendly countries in Europe,[245] but more of the Dutch (36%) than of the Danes (23%) list the bike as their most frequent mode of transport on a typical day.[246][l] Cycling infrastructure is comprehensive. Busy roads have received some 35,000 km of dedicated cycle tracks, physically segregated from motorised traffic.[249] Busy junctions are often equipped with bicycle-specific traffic lights. There are large bicycle parking facilities, particularly in city centres and at train stations. Water transport Until the introduction of trains, ships were the primary mode of transport in the Netherlands. And shipping has remained crucial afterwards. The Port of Rotterdam is the largest port in Europe and the largest port in the world outside East-Asia, with the rivers Meuse and Rhine providing excellent access to the hinterland upstream reaching to Basel, Switzerland, and into Germany and France. As of 2013[update], Rotterdam was the world's eighth largest container port handling 440.5 million metric tonnes of cargo annually.[250] The port's main activities are petrochemical industries and general cargo handling and transshipment. The harbour functions as an important transit point for bulk materials and between the European continent and overseas. From Rotterdam goods are transported by ship, river barge, train or road. The Volkeraksluizen between Rotterdam and Antwerp are the biggest sluices for inland navigation in the world in terms of tonnage passing through them. In 2007, the Betuweroute, a new fast freight railway from Rotterdam to Germany, was completed. The Netherlands also hosts Europe's 4th largest port in Amsterdam. The inland shipping fleet of the Netherlands is the largest in Europe.[251] The Netherlands also has the largest fleet of active historical ships in the world.[252] Boats are used for passenger travel as well, such as the Watertaxies in Rotterdam. The ferry network in Amsterdam and the Waterbus network in Rotterdam are part of the public transport system. Air transport Schiphol Airport, just southwest of Amsterdam, is the main international airport in the Netherlands, and the third busiest airport in Europe in terms of passengers. Schiphol is the main hub for KLM, the nation's flag carrier and the world's oldest airline.[253] In 2016, the Royal Schiphol Group airports handled 70 million passengers.[254] All air traffic is international and Schiphol Airport is connected to over 300 destinations worldwide, more than any other European airport.[255] The airport is a major freight hub as well, processing 1.44 million tonnes of cargo in 2020.[256] Smaller international airports in the country include Eindhoven Airport, Rotterdam The Hague Airport, Maastricht Aachen Airport and Groningen Airport Eelde. Air transport is of vital significance for the Caribbean part of the Netherlands, with all islands having their own airport. This includes the shortest runway in the world on Saba.[257] Culture Main article: Culture of the Netherlands Some symbols and icons of Dutch culture Art, architecture and philosophy Main articles: Dutch art, Architecture of the Netherlands, and Dutch literature The Tower of Babel by Brabantine artist Pieter Bruegel the Elder.Water Mill at Kollen Near Nuenen by Brabantine artist Vincent van GoghThe Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam The Netherlands has had many well-known painters. In the Middle Ages Hieronymus Bosch, Petrus Christus, Lucas Gassel and Pieter Bruegel the Elder were leading Dutch pioneers. During the Dutch Golden Age, spanning much of the 17th century, the Dutch Republic was prosperous and witnessed a flourishing artistic movement. This was the age of the ""Dutch Masters"", such as Rembrandt van Rijn, Johannes Vermeer, Jan Steen, Jacob van Ruisdael, Gerard van Honthorst, Theodoor van Thulden and many others. Famous Dutch painters of the 19th and 20th century were Vincent van Gogh and the luminists Jan Sluijters, Leo Gestel, and Piet Mondrian. M. C. Escher is a well-known graphic artist. Willem de Kooning was born and trained in Rotterdam, although he is considered to have reached acclaim as an American artist. Literature flourished as well during the Dutch Golden Age, with Joost van den Vondel and P. C. Hooft as the two most famous writers. In the 19th century, Multatuli wrote about the poor treatment of the natives in the Dutch colony, the current Indonesia. Important 20th century authors include Godfried Bomans, Harry Mulisch, Jan Wolkers, Simon Vestdijk, Hella S. Haasse, Cees Nooteboom, Gerard Reve and Willem Frederik Hermans. Anne Frank's Diary of a Young Girl was published after she was murdered in the Holocaust and translated from Dutch to all major languages. Various architectural styles can be distinguished in the Netherlands. Over the years, various styles have been built and preserved. The Romanesque architecture was built between the years 950 and 1250. This architectural style is most concentrated in the provinces of Gelderland and Limburg. Limburg, in particular, differs greatly in architectural style from the rest of the Netherlands. The Gothic architecture came to in the Netherlands from about 1230. Gothic buildings often had large windows, pointed arches and were richly decorated. Brabantine Gothic originated with the rise of the Duchy of Brabant and spread throughout the Burgundian provinces. This architectural style is most concentrated in the province of North Brabant, such as St. John's Cathedral in 's-Hertogenbosch, The Church of Our Lady in Breda and the Margraves Palace in Bergen op Zoom. What many know as traditional Dutch architecture is the Dutch Baroque architecture (1525 – 1630) and classicism (1630 – 1700). These style of architecture is especially in evidence in the cities of North Holland, South Holland and Zeeland. Other architectural styles that are common in the Netherlands are Style Louis XIV, Art Nouveau, Rationalism, Neoclassicism Expressionism, De Stijl, Traditionalism and Brutalism. The Netherlands is the country of philosophers Erasmus, Rudolf Agricola and Spinoza. Much of Descartes' major work was done in the Netherlands, where he studied at Leiden University — as did geologist James Hutton, British Prime Minister John Stuart, U.S. President John Quincy Adams, Physics Nobel Prize laureate Hendrik Lorentz and Enrico Fermi. The Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens (1629–1695) discovered Saturn's moon Titan, argued that light travelled as waves, invented the pendulum clock and was the first physicist to use mathematical formulae. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek was the first to observe and describe single-celled organisms with a microscope. Replicas of Dutch buildings can be found in Huis Ten Bosch, Nagasaki, Japan. A similar Holland Village is being built in Shenyang, China. Windmills, tulips, wooden shoes, cheese, Delftware pottery, and cannabis are among the items associated with the Netherlands by tourists. Southern Netherlands Carnival in North Brabant and Limburg In the south of the Netherlands there are some festivals that rarely or never occur in the rest of the Netherlands. These celebrations grew out of Catholic traditions, including Carnival, lantern parades during the celebration of Three Kings, Brabantian Day and huge Bloemencorso. Bloemencorsos used to occur in many places in the Netherlands, but in the 21st century, Zundert and Valkenswaard in North Brabant have taken the lead. Dutch value system Main article: Dutch customs and etiquette Dutch society is egalitarian and modern. The Dutch have an aversion to the non-essential.[258] Ostentatious behaviour is to be avoided. The Dutch are proud of their cultural heritage, rich history in art and involvement in international affairs.[258] Dutch people in orange celebrating King's Day in Amsterdam, 2017 Dutch manners are open and direct with a no-nonsense attitude—informality combined with adherence to basic behaviour. According to a humorous source on Dutch culture, ""Their directness gives many the impression that they are rude and crude—attributes they prefer to call openness.""[258] A well known more serious source on Dutch etiquette is ""Dealing with the Dutch"" by Jacob Vossestein: ""Dutch egalitarianism is the idea that people are equal, especially from a moral point of view, and accordingly, causes the somewhat ambiguous stance the Dutch have towards hierarchy and status.""[259] As always, manners differ between groups. Asking about basic rules will not be considered impolite. ""What may strike you as being blatantly blunt topics and comments are no more embarrassing or unusual to the Dutch than discussing the weather.""[258] The Netherlands is one of the most secular countries of Europe, and religion in the Netherlands is generally considered as a personal matter which is not supposed to be propagated in public, although it often remains a discussion subject. For only 17% of the population religion is important and 14% goes to church weekly.[260] The Netherlands has a long history of social tolerance and today is regarded as a liberal country, considering its drug policy and its legalisation of euthanasia. On 1 April 2001, the Netherlands became the first nation to legalise same-sex marriage.[261] Dutch people and ecology As of 2018 the Netherlands had one of the highest rates of carbon dioxide emissions per capita in the European Union, above those of Germany, France and Belgium.[262] In addition, the Dutch waste more food than any other EU citizen, at over three times the EU average [263] Despite this, the Netherlands has nonetheless the reputation of the leader country in environmental and population management.[264] In 2015, Amsterdam and Rotterdam were ranked fourth and fifth, respectively, on the Arcadis Sustainable Cities Index.[265][266] Sustainability is a concept important for the Dutch. The goal of the Dutch Government is to have a sustainable, reliable and affordable energy system, by 2050, in which CO2 emissions have been halved and 40 per cent of electricity is derived from sustainable sources.[267] The government is investing billions of euros in energy efficiency, sustainable energy and CO2 reduction. The Kingdom also encourages Dutch companies to build sustainable business/projects/facilities, with financial aids from the state to the companies or individuals who are active in making the country more sustainable.[267] Music Main articles: Music of the Netherlands and Music of the former Netherlands Antilles Pop singer Anouk in 2013 The Netherlands has multiple music traditions. Traditional Dutch music is a genre known as ""Levenslied"", meaning Song of life, to an extent comparable to a French Chanson or a German Schlager. These songs typically have a simple melody and rhythm, and a straightforward structure of verses and choruses. Themes can be light, but are often sentimental and include love, death and loneliness. Traditional musical instruments such as the accordion and the barrel organ are a staple of levenslied music, though in recent years many artists also use synthesisers and guitars. Artists in this genre include Jan Smit, Frans Bauer and André Hazes. Contemporary Dutch rock and pop music (Nederpop) originated in the 1960s, heavily influenced by popular music from the United States and Britain. In the 1960s and 1970s the lyrics were mostly in English, and some tracks were instrumental. Bands such as Shocking Blue, Golden Earring, Tee Set, George Baker Selection and Focus enjoyed international success. As of the 1980s, more and more pop musicians started working in the Dutch language, partly inspired by the huge success of the band Doe Maar. Today Dutch rock and pop music thrives in both languages, with some artists recording in both. Johan Cruyff Arena, the largest Dutch concert venue Current symphonic metal bands Epica, Delain, ReVamp, The Gathering, Asrai, Autumn, Ayreon and Within Temptation as well as jazz and pop singer Caro Emerald are having international success. Also, metal bands like Hail of Bullets, God Dethroned, Izegrim, Asphyx, Textures, Present Danger, Heidevolk and Slechtvalk are popular guests at the biggest metal festivals in Europe. Contemporary local stars include pop singer Anouk, country pop singer Ilse DeLange, South Guelderish and Limburgish dialect singing folk band Rowwen Hèze, rock band BLØF and duo Nick & Simon. Trijntje Oosterhuis, one of the country's most well known and versatile singers, has made multiple albums with famous American composers Vince Mendoza and Burt Bacharach. Early 1990s Dutch and Belgian house music came together in Eurodance project 2 Unlimited. Selling 18 million records,[268] the two singers in the band are the most successful Dutch music artists to this day. Tracks like ""Get Ready for This"" are still popular themes of U.S. sports events, like the NHL. In the mid 1990s Dutch language rap and hip hop (Nederhop) also came to fruition and has become popular in the Netherlands and Belgium. Artists with North African, Caribbean or Middle Eastern origins have strongly influenced this genre. Since the 1990s, Dutch electronic dance music (EDM) gained widespread popularity in the world in many forms, from trance, techno and gabber to hardstyle. Some of the world's best known dance music DJs hail from the Netherlands, including Armin van Buuren, Tiësto, Hardwell, Martin Garrix, Dash Berlin, Julian Jordan, Nicky Romero, W&W, Don Diablo and Afrojack; the first four of which have been ranked as best in the world by DJ Mag Top 100 DJs. The Amsterdam Dance Event (ADE) is the world's leading electronic music conference and the biggest club festival for the many electronic subgenres on the planet.[269][270] These DJs also contribute to the world's mainstream pop music, as they frequently collaborate and produce for high-profile international artists. The Netherlands have participated in the Eurovision Song Contest since its first edition in 1956, and have won five times. Their most recent win was in 2019. In classical music, Jan Sweelinck ranks as the Dutch most famous composer, with Louis Andriessen amongst the best known living Dutch classical composers. Ton Koopman is a Dutch conductor, organist and harpsichordist. He is also professor at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague. Notable violinists are Janine Jansen and André Rieu. The latter, together with his Johann Strauss Orchestra, has taken classical and waltz music on worldwide concert tours, the size and revenue of which are otherwise only seen from the world's biggest rock and pop music acts. The most famous Dutch classical composition is ""Canto Ostinato"" by Simeon ten Holt, a minimalistic composition for multiple instruments.[271][272][273] Acclaimed harpist Lavinia Meijer in 2012 released an album with works from Philip Glass that she transcribed for harp, with approval of Glass himself.[274] The Concertgebouw (completed in 1888) in Amsterdam is home to the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, considered one of the world's finest orchestras.[275] Film and television Main articles: Cinema of the Netherlands and Television in the Netherlands Some Dutch films – mainly by director Paul Verhoeven – have received international distribution and recognition, such as Turkish Delight (""Turks Fruit"", 1973), Soldier of Orange (""Soldaat van Oranje"", 1977), Spetters (1980) and The Fourth Man (""De Vierde Man"", 1983). Verhoeven then went on to direct big Hollywood movies like RoboCop (1987), Total Recall (1990) and Basic Instinct (1992), and returned with Dutch film Black Book (""Zwartboek"", 2006). Other well-known Dutch film directors are Jan de Bont (Speed), Anton Corbijn (A Most wanted Man), Dick Maas (De Lift), Fons Rademakers (The Assault), and documentary makers Bert Haanstra and Joris Ivens. Film director Theo van Gogh achieved international notoriety in 2004 when he was murdered by Mohammed Bouyeri in the streets of Amsterdam after directing the short film Submission. Internationally, successful directors of photography from the Netherlands are Hoyte van Hoytema (Interstellar, Spectre, Dunkirk) and Theo van de Sande (Wayne's World and Blade). Van Hoytema went to the National Film School in Łódź (Poland) and Van de Sande went to the Netherlands Film Academy. Internationally successful Dutch actors include Famke Janssen (X-Men), Carice van Houten (Game of Thrones), Michiel Huisman (Game of Thrones), Rutger Hauer (Blade Runner), Jeroen Krabbé (The Living Daylights) and Derek de Lint (Three Men and a Baby). The Netherlands has a well developed television market, with both multiple commercial and public broadcasters. Imported TV programmes, as well as interviews with responses in a foreign language, are virtually always shown with the original sound and subtitled. Only foreign shows for children are dubbed.[276] TV exports from the Netherlands mostly take the form of specific formats and franchises, most notably through internationally active TV production conglomerate Endemol, founded by Dutch media tycoons John de Mol and Joop van den Ende. Headquartered in Amsterdam, Endemol has around 90 companies in over 30 countries. Endemol and its subsidiaries create and run reality, talent, and game show franchises worldwide, including Big Brother and Deal or No Deal. John de Mol later started his own company Talpa which created show franchises like The Voice and Utopia. Sports Main article: Sports in the Netherlands Dutch star football players Arjen Robben and Robin van Persie during a game with the Netherlands against Denmark at Euro 2012 Approximately 4.5 million of the 16.8 million people in the Netherlands are registered to one of the 35,000 sports clubs in the country. About two-thirds of the population between 15 and 75 participates in sports weekly.[277] Football is the most popular participant sport in the Netherlands, before field hockey and volleyball as the second and third most popular team sports. The Netherlands national football team is one of the most popular aspects of Dutch sports; especially since the 1970s when one of the greatest footballers of all time, Johan Cruyff, developed Total Football with coach Rinus Michels. Tennis, gymnastics and golf are the three most widely engaged in individual sports.[278] Organisation of sports began at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. Federations for sports were established (such as the speed skating federation in 1882), rules were unified and sports clubs came into existence. A Dutch National Olympic Committee was established in 1912. Thus far, the nation has won 266 medals at the Summer Olympic Games and another 110 medals at the Winter Olympic Games. In international competition, Dutch national teams and athletes are dominant in several fields of sport. The Netherlands women's field hockey team is the most successful team in World Cup history. The Netherlands baseball team have won the European championship 20 times out of 32 events. Dutch K-1 kickboxers have won the K-1 World Grand Prix 15 times out of 19 tournaments. The Netherlands Women's handball team holds the record of the only team in the world that consecutively reached all six semifinals of major international tournaments since 2015, winning silver and bronze at the European Women's Handball Championship and silver, bronze and gold at the World Women's Handball Championship. They finished fourth at the 2016 Summer Olympics. The Dutch speed skaters' performance at the 2014 Winter Olympics, where they won 8 out of 12 events, 23 out of 36 medals, including 4 clean sweeps, is the most dominant performance in a single sport in Olympic history. Motorcycle racing at the TT Circuit Assen has a long history. Assen is the only venue to have held a round of the Motorcycle World Championship every year since its creation in 1949. The circuit was purpose-built for the Dutch TT in 1954, with previous events having been held on public roads. The Dutch have also had success in all three of cyclings Grand Tours with Jan Janssen winning the 1968 Tour de France, more recently with Tom Dumoulin winning the 2017 Giro d'Italia and legendary rider Joop Zoetemelk was the 1985 UCI World Champion, the winner of the 1979 Vuelta a Espana, the 1980 Tour de France and still holds or shares numerous Tour de France records including most Tours finished and most kilometres ridden. Max Verstappen currently races in Formula One, and was the first Dutchman to win a Grand Prix. He was also the youngest driver to make his debut at the age of 17, and became the youngest race winner at the age of 18. The coastal resort of Zandvoort hosted the Dutch Grand Prix from 1958 to 1985, and has been announced to return in 2020.[279] The volleyball national men's team has also been successful, winning the silver medal at the 1992 Summer Olympics and the gold medal four years later in Atlanta. The biggest success of the women's national team was winning the European Championship in 1995 and the World Grand Prix in 2007. Recently cricket has made a remarkable progress in the Netherlands. Netherlands have participated in 1996, 2003, 2007 and 2011 ODI cricket World Cup. They have also qualified for 2009 and 2014 T20 World Cup. In the 2009 T20 World Cup, Netherlands defeated England, the current World Champions and inventor of the game.[280] Ryan ten Doeschate is the only Dutch player to have played in the IPL on the team Kolkata Knight Riders. Cuisine Main article: Dutch cuisine Stroopwafels (syrup waffles) are a treat consisting of waffles with caramel-like syrup filling in the middle.Bossche Bol is a pastry from the south of the Netherlands. It is filled with fresh cream and dipped in dark chocolatePoffertjes are made in a special, so-called, poffertjespan.The Gouda cheese market in Gouda CityHutspot with klapstuk (beef)Oliebollen, a Dutch pastry eaten on New Year's EveBitterballen are usually served with mustard. Originally, the country's cuisine was shaped by the practices of fishing and farming, including the cultivation of the soil for growing crops and raising domesticated animals. Dutch cuisine is simple and straightforward, and contains many dairy products. Breakfast and lunch are typically bread with toppings, with cereal for breakfast as an alternative. Traditionally, dinner consists of potatoes, a portion of meat, and (seasonal) vegetables. The Dutch diet was relatively high in carbohydrates and fat, reflecting the dietary needs of the labourers whose culture moulded the country. Without many refinements, it is best described as rustic, though many holidays are still celebrated with special foods. In the course of the twentieth century this diet changed and became much more cosmopolitan, with most global cuisines being represented in the major cities. Modern culinary writers distinguish between three general regional forms of Dutch cuisine. The regions in the northeast of the Netherlands, roughly the provinces of Groningen, Friesland, Drenthe, Overijssel and Gelderland north of the great rivers are the least populated areas of the Netherlands. The late (18th century) introduction of large scale agriculture means that the cuisine is generally known for its many kinds of meats. The relative lack of farms allowed for an abundance of game and husbandry, though dishes near the coastal regions of Friesland, Groningen and the parts of Overijssel bordering the IJsselmeer also include a large amount of fish. The various dried sausages, belonging to the metworst-family of Dutch sausages are found throughout this region and are highly prized for their often very strong taste. Also smoked sausages are common, of which (Gelderse) rookworst is the most renowned. The sausage contains a lot of fat and is very juicy. Larger sausages are often eaten alongside stamppot, hutspot or zuurkool (sauerkraut); whereas smaller ones are often eaten as a street food. The provinces are also home to hard textured rye bread, pastries and cookies, the latter heavily spiced with ginger or succade or containing small bits of meat. Various kinds of Kruidkoek (such as Groninger koek), Fryske dúmkes and spekdikken (small savoury pancakes cooked in a waffle iron) are considered typical. A notable characteristic of Fries roggebrood (Frisian rye bread) is its long baking time (up to 20 hours), resulting in a sweet taste and a deep dark colour.[281] In terms of alcoholic beverages, the region is renowned for its many bitters (such as Beerenburg) and other high-proof liquors rather than beer, which is, apart from Jenever, typical for the rest of the country. As a coastal region, Friesland is home to low-lying grasslands, and thus has a cheese production in common with the Western cuisine. Friese Nagelkaas (Friesian Clove) is a notable example. The provinces of North Holland, South Holland, Zeeland, and Utrecht and the Gelderlandic area of Betuwe make up the region in which western Dutch cuisine is found. Because of the abundance of water and flat grasslands that are found here, the area is known for its many dairy products, which include prominent cheeses such as Gouda, Leyden (spiced cheese with cumin), and Edam (traditionally in small spheres) as well as Leerdammer and Beemster, while the adjacent Zaanstreek in North Holland has since the 16th century been known for its mayonnaise, typical whole-grain mustards,[282] and chocolate industry. Zeeland and South Holland produce a lot of butter, which contains a larger amount of milkfat than most other European butter varieties. A by-product of the butter-making process, karnemelk (buttermilk), is also considered typical for this region. Seafood such as soused herring, mussels (called Zeeuwse Mossels, since all Dutch mussels for consumption are cleaned in Zeeland's Oosterschelde), eels, oysters and shrimps are widely available and typical for the region. Kibbeling, once a local delicacy consisting of small chunks of battered white fish, has become a national fast food, just as lekkerbek. Pastries in this area tend to be quite doughy, and often contain large amounts of sugar; either caramelised, powdered or crystallised. The oliebol (in its modern form) and Zeeuwse bolus are good examples. Cookies are also produced in great number and tend to contain a lot of butter and sugar, like stroopwafel, as well as a filling of some kind, mostly almond, like gevulde koek. The traditional alcoholic beverages of this region are beer (strong pale lager) and Jenever, a high proof juniper-flavoured spirit, that came to be known in England as gin. A noted exception within the traditional Dutch alcoholic landscape, Advocaat, a rich and creamy liqueur made from eggs, sugar and brandy, is also native to this region. The Southern Dutch cuisine consists of the cuisines of the Dutch provinces of North Brabant and Limburg and the Flemish Region in Belgium. It is renowned for its many rich pastries, soups, stews and vegetable dishes and is often called Burgundian which is a Dutch idiom invoking the rich Burgundian court which ruled the Low Countries in the Middle Ages, renowned for its splendor and great feasts. It is the only Dutch culinary region that developed an haute cuisine. Pastries are abundant, often with rich fillings of cream, custard or fruits. Cakes, such as the Vlaai from Limburg and the Moorkop and Bossche Bol from Brabant, are typical pastries. Savoury pastries also occur, with the worstenbroodje (a roll with a sausage of ground beef, literally translates into sausage bread) being the most popular. The traditional alcoholic beverage of the region is beer. There are many local brands, ranging from Trappist to Kriek. 5 of the 10 International Trappist Association recognised breweries in the world, are located in the Southern Dutch cultural area. Beer, like wine in French cuisine, is also used in cooking; often in stews. In early 2014, Oxfam ranked the Netherlands as the country with the most nutritious, plentiful and healthy food, in a comparison of 125 countries.[283][284] Colonial heritage Main article: Dutch Empire Further information: Dutch East Indies and Indos in the Dutch East Indies New Amsterdam as it appeared in 1664. Under British rule it became known as New York. From the exploitations in the Mughal Empire in the 17th century, to the colonisations in the 19th century, Dutch imperial possessions continued to expand, reaching their greatest extent by establishing a hegemony of the Dutch East Indies in the early 20th century. The Dutch East Indies, which later formed modern-day Indonesia, was one of the most valuable European colonies in the world and the most important one for the Netherlands.[285] Over 350 years of mutual heritage has left a significant cultural mark on the Netherlands. In the Dutch Golden Age of the 17th century, the Netherlands urbanised considerably, mostly financed by corporate revenue from the Asian trade monopolies. Social status was based on merchants' income, which reduced feudalism and considerably changed the dynamics of Dutch society. When the Dutch royal family was established in 1815, much of its wealth came from Colonial trade.[286] Eustachius De Lannoy of the Dutch East India Company surrenders to Maharaja Marthanda Varma of the Indian Kingdom of Travancore after the Battle of Colachel. (Depiction at Padmanabhapuram Palace) By the 17th century, the Dutch East India Company established their base in parts of Ceylon (modern-day Sri Lanka). Afterward, they established ports in Dutch occupied Malabar, leading to Dutch settlements and trading posts in India. However, their expansion into India was halted, after their defeat in the Battle of Colachel by the Kingdom of Travancore, during the Travancore-Dutch War. The Dutch never recovered from the defeat and no longer posed a large colonial threat to Bengal Subah.[287][288] Universities such as the Leiden University, founded in the 16th century, have developed into leading knowledge centres for Southeast Asian and Indonesian studies.[m] Leiden University has produced leading academics such as Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje, and still has academics who specialise in Indonesian languages and cultures. Leiden University and in particular KITLV are educational and scientific institutions that to this day share both an intellectual and historical interest in Indonesian studies. Other scientific institutions in the Netherlands include the Amsterdam Tropenmuseum, an anthropological museum with massive collections of Indonesian art, culture, ethnography and anthropology. A Dutch doctor vaccinating Indonesian patients The traditions of the Royal Dutch East Indies Army (KNIL) are maintained by the Regiment Van Heutsz of the modern Royal Netherlands Army. A dedicated Bronbeek Museum, a former home for retired KNIL soldiers, exists in Arnhem to this day. A specific segment of Dutch literature called Dutch Indies literature still exists and includes established authors, such as Louis Couperus, the writer of ""The Hidden Force"", taking the colonial era as an important source of inspiration.[289] One of the great masterpieces of Dutch literature is the book ""Max Havelaar"", written by Multatuli in 1860.[290] The majority of Dutchmen that repatriated to the Netherlands after and during the Indonesian revolution are Indo (Eurasian), native to the islands of the Dutch East Indies. This relatively large Eurasian population had developed over a period of 400 years and were classified by colonial law as belonging to the European legal community.[291] In Dutch they are referred to as Indische Nederlanders or as Indo (short for Indo-European).[292] Including their second generation descendants, Indos are currently the largest foreign-born group in the Netherlands. In 2008, the Dutch Central Bureau for Statistics (CBS)[293] registered 387,000 first- and second-generation Indos living in the Netherlands.[294] Although considered fully assimilated into Dutch society, as the main ethnic minority in the Netherlands, these 'repatriants' have played a pivotal role in introducing elements of Indonesian culture into Dutch mainstream culture. Many Indonesian dishes and foodstuffs have become commonplace in the Netherlands. Rijsttafel, a colonial culinary concept, and dishes such as Nasi goreng and satay are very popular in the country.[295] Practically any town of any size in the Netherlands has a ""toko"" (a Dutch Indonesian Shop) or a Chinese-Indonesian restaurant,[296] and many 'Pasar Malam' (Night market in Malay/Indonesian) fairs are organised throughout the year.

A new project by Zoe Stamatopoulou, associate professor of classics and a Faculty Fellow in the Center for the Humanities for the spring 2021 semester, singles out one of his lesser known works for closer analysis. Read on for more of Stamatopoulou’s “Plutarch’s Symposium of the Seven Sages: A Commentary and a Translation.” Briefly, what is your project about? I am currently working on a translation of and a commentary on Plutarch’s Symposium of the Seven Sages, a dialogue also known by the title Dinner (or Banquet) of the Seven Sages. This work is very rich in content as the banqueters discuss a broad variety of topics; however, the conversation keeps returning to the theme of governance, which is explored through discussions about the proper management of the state, the household and the self. My two projects, the commentary and the translation, complement each other and aim at making this neglected work more accessible and widely known among specialists as well as nonspecialists. The commentary provides the support one needs to read the dialogue in the original Greek and suggests certain interpretive approaches. It includes an exegesis of the text with notes on the language and the content and other pertinent information. In addition, it offers an introduction to the author’s life and style, and an overview of the various traditions that inform this particular dialogue. The translation, on the other hand, is intended to appeal to a broader readership, offering essential notes and a basic introduction. Plutarch as illustrated in the Nuremberg Chronicle, 1493.Who was Plutarch? How does he figure into the Greek tradition of dialogues? Plutarch was an intellectual powerhouse of the late 1st and early 2nd c CE (ca. 45–ca. 125 CE). Today he is best known for his biographies, but he also produced a rich corpus of diverse non-biographical works, including essays on practical ethics, works that explore Greek and Roman cultural practices, and treatises offering political advice. Some of these non-biographical works are dialogues, a literary form that allows Plutarch to present different opinions in a vivid and engaging manner. As a lifelong student of Greek philosophy, Plutarch was very familiar with the philosophical dialogue, a genre which we tend to associate almost exclusively with Plato but was, in fact, adopted by other philosophers as well. Some of Plutarch’s dialogues, including the Symposium of the Seven Sages, dramatize the discussion of philosophical and other questions specifically in a convivial setting. In the prologue to the first book of his Table Talk, a collection of convivial scenes, Plutarch situates this work explicitly within a long tradition that he traces back to Plato, Xenophon and Aristotle. You’ve noted that Plutarch’s inclusion of women in the work is unusual. How so, and why is that important? The Symposium of the Seven Sages features two female figures: Melissa, the host’s wife, and Eumetis (aka Cleobulina), who is the young daughter of one of Sages. These two female characters eat alongside the male banqueters but retire from the convivial space soon after the meal is over. Their presence is remarkable for several reasons. To begin with, Plutarch is projecting onto the past a practice that was acceptable in his own era but, as far as we know, not in the 6th century BCE, when this fictional dialogue is set. The archaic and classical symposion was reserved for male members of the elite and excluded “respectable” women; the only females allowed in the convivial space were enslaved stewards as well as performers and prostitutes. Plutarch lets freeborn elite women into his fictional banquet, but still circumscribes the extent of their attendance. Furthermore, both female characters embody what Plutarch considered exemplary behavior for women, thus contributing to the education of his readership, both male and female. Both women are portrayed as beneficial to the male head of their household (Melissa’s husband; Eumetis’ father), and both remain silent within the male-dominated convivial space. The case of Eumetis is particularly interesting because she is praised for being extraordinarily intelligent and a positive influence upon her father’s leadership. She is also said to be world-famous for her riddles, some of which are performed, criticized and defended by the male banqueters in the dialogue, while she sits in silence and voluntarily represses her voice. The fact that the Symposium pays attention to Melissa and Eumetis at all is exceptional when one compares this dialogue with Plutarch’s other sympotic work, the Table Talk, a collection of convivial vignettes in nine books which features a rich cast of banqueters, none of them female. Both Plutarch and modern literature on management agree on a fundamental point: Good leadership entails a constant learning curve and thus requires an open mind. How does the Symposium compare with today’s business/organizational leadership best-sellers? I must confess that I haven’t read many leadership best-sellers lately but, from what I gather, there are interesting points of convergence between these works and Plutarch’s Symposium. In terms of form, Plutarch’s dialogue and the modern self-help handbook are clearly two different genres; there is something to be said, however, about the use of anecdotes and hypothetical scenarios in the latter. These case studies, which often involve dialogue, are presented as paradigms for the reader to engage with critically, to assess and to emulate or reject. Similarly, Plutarch’s Symposium dramatizes interactions and intellectual exchanges that stimulate the readers to think critically but also teaches them something about proper behavior and communication, especially in elite convivial contexts. In terms of content, both Plutarch and modern literature on management agree on a fundamental point: Good leadership entails a constant learning curve and thus requires an open mind. Furthermore, Plutarch’s Symposium emphasizes — at least according to my interpretation — how crucial proper mentorship and competent advisers are for good leadership. Networks mattered in Plutarch’s world as much as they do in modern corporate culture, and the Symposium stresses the benefits of associating with the right people. In this dialogue, finally, Plutarch’s approach to leadership is guided by pragmatism rather than idealism, an approach that he shares with at least some modern handbooks. Looming in the background of the Symposium is the Platonic ideal of the philosopher-king who lives in moderation and inspires loyalty with his virtue and competence; clearly, the ruler who hosts the Sages in the dialogue falls short of this ideal, and yet his political leadership is portrayed as adequately efficient and viable. Who was Plutarch writing for? How were these ideas received in his own era, and how are they relevant today? Plutarch wrote exclusively in Greek but his intended readership encompassed not only educated Greeks but also members of the Roman elite, as well as other non-Greeks with proficiency in the language and an interest in Plutarch’s intellectual projects. The reception of his works and ideas is a vast topic, and there is now an excellent volume of 724 pages, edited by Sophia Xenophontos and Katerina Oikonomopoulou (Brill, 2019), which offers a survey of Plutarch’s rich reception history from the Roman Imperial period through Late Antiquity and Byzantium to the Renaissance, Enlightenment and the modern era. Plutarch’s works are so numerous and diverse that they have something to offer to most modern readers, whether they are interested, for instance, in military and social history, ethics, leadership or women in antiquity.

LOUIS — Flatten the curve. Social distance. Shelter in place. Those phrases entered our collective vocabulary in March 2020 when the first coronavirus cases were reported in the St. Louis area and, public health and government officials instituted emergency orders aimed at reducing the spread of the virus. A study published Wednesday by the Washington University School of Medicine says those measures likely saved the lives of thousands of people. A delay of even two weeks in issuing local public health orders could have increased the number of deaths almost sevenfold in the city and county, according to the university's data analysis. St. Louis area leaders enacted the safety measures, in part, due to the cases in New York and Boston. ""Whether a similar situation would have happened in St. Louis is not obvious,” said lead author Elvin H. Geng, MD, a professor of medicine. “Some may argue that because the same thing didn’t happen here, it could never have happened here and that, therefore, early social-distancing policies were an overreaction. ""But our data suggest that a large number of deaths due to the pandemic was indeed possible in St. Louis, and therefore, the early implementation of public health orders helped prevent the number of deaths that cities such as New York and other places experienced.” The researchers used a model to examine what was likely to have happened if the epidemic trajectory in St. Louis early in March had continued without the enactment of public health policies for another one, two and four weeks, according to a press release from the university. RELATED: WashU study: People who contract COVID more likely to suffer decline in kidney function With the public health orders in place (bans on large gatherings, closures of bars, restaurants, schools and shelter-in-place), St. Louis area hospitals saw a total of 2,246 COVID-19 hospitalizations and 482 deaths attributed to COVID-19 by June 15, 2020. If the orders had been delayed two weeks, the researchers’ modeling indicates that the city and county likely would have seen 3,292 deaths by June 15 — a nearly sevenfold increase over what was actually recorded in the first three months of the pandemic. In the two-week delay scenario, the model predicts an increase in cumulative total hospitalizations by June 15 from the actual number of 2,246 to an estimated 19,600 — a nearly ninefold increase. St. Patrick's Day celebrations were amongst the first events to be cancelled last year, organizers hoped that dispersing those crowds -- sometimes thousands deep -- would help with our case counts. It was an 11th hour call that organizers call a hard decision, though ultimately the right one. ""We feel good,"" Jim Mohan, a Dogtown parade organizer, said. ""At the time, we weren't sure what was going on, but we based it on what we thought was the best information we had and an abundance of caution too."" Even a one-week delay in public health measures would have increased hospitalizations and deaths, with an estimated 8,000 hospitalizations and 1,300 deaths by June 15, under the modeling scenario. At STL Style, owners were quick to get on-board with the message to ""flatten the curve,"" printing t-shirts with the phrase that became one of their top sellers in 2020. ""There is no other city that is as right for exploring that as St. Louis with our Arch. So we just turned it into a visual and voila,"" co-owner Jeff Vines said, motioning to the design that features the soaring curves of the Arch over a lower curve meant to represent suppressed COVID case trends. ""Not only did we 'flatten' the curve, but you could also say we crushed the curve,"" Geng said. The researchers also estimated how the delays in enacting public health orders might have played out if the public had voluntarily changed its behavior. ""If the public had changed its behavior enough to cut viral transmission by half — an optimistic scenario — a two-week delay still would have resulted in an estimated 8,090 hospitalizations and about 1,400 deaths,"" the release said. As COVID-19 cases rose in other parts of the country, data from cell phones in the St. Louis area showed the public made no changes in mobility before the city and county orders. ""A pandemic is like a big ship; it takes time to change course,"" Geng said. But as the virus ramped up, early social distancing policies in St. Louis mitigated it just before it really exploded.” Geng performed this analysis with colleagues at Washington University, BJC HealthCare, Saint Louis University, Mercy Health and elsewhere, including senior author Maya Peterson, MD, PhD, of the University of California at Berkeley, and lead programmer and co-author Joshua Schwab, of the University of California at San Francisco. The researchers said they hope that other public health officials across the country will be able to use it to inform pandemic responses in their communities, the release said.

Now that you are aware, it is time to take action! Treading water is an awesome way to raise awareness and donations for programs like SWIM Cambodia that teach school-age children basic swimming, water safety and safe rescue skills. How long can you tread? Project: SWIM Cambodia Drowning is the leading cause of child (ages 1-17) mortality (death) in Cambodia. Over 2,000 Cambodian children die from drowning each year. Children who drown in Cambodia rarely present at hospitals (only 6.6%) and therefore are not often counted in that country’s official death records. SWIM (Safety When It Matters) Cambodia is the first significant water safety program in Cambodia, of it's kind. SWIM will teach children water safety education, survival swimming skills, safe rescue techniques, and CPR.

Each year, near drowning incidents also result in life-long disabilities.‍Drowning is preventable. Young children are more at risk and can drown in any body of water, including a bucket, bathtub, sink, pool or spa. Drowning Prevention is most effective with a “layers of protection” approach:·      Never leave a child alone near water, even for a few seconds.·      A supervising adult should be close enough to touch the child under 4 years old near water.·      Keep a constant adult eye on young children of all ages.·      All collections of water are dangerous for infants and toddlers, including bathtubs, buckets, toilets, ponds, spas, swimming pools, and natural water sites.·      Swimming pools should have fences, alarms, and drains that meet regulations.·      Pool gates should be self-latching, opening outward, with the latch out-of-reach for a child.·      Keep reaching and throwing aids near a swimming pool.·      All children should wear a personal floatation device while playing near bodies of water.·      Parents and child caregivers should know how to perform rescue techniques and strategies to respond in an emergency.·      If a child is missing, check the pool first.

Boating - frequently asked questions Q: When and why should I check the weather conditions before I go out boating? A thorough check of weather conditions is vital every time one goes boating. This includes having an appreciation of how the conditions may change throughout the day. A forecast change in weather for example may result in relatively calm conditions in the morning turning into potentially dangerous conditions in the afternoon. Make sure your vessel is appropriate for the conditions and that you have the necessary experience to handle the forecast conditions. Remember if in doubt, don’t go out. Q: I’ve been boating for years and can swim OK, do I still need to wear a life jacket? Life jackets   are an important safety item on any boat and there should be one on board for each person, and Waterways recommends that children and poor swimmers wear one at all times when afloat. Make sure that your life jacket is in good condition, accessible and ready for use because a life jacket stowed under an anchor chain will not do the job it was designed for and that is to help save a life. Q: Is it OK to have a few beers when out on the water in a boat? The combination of wind waves and weather can multiply the effects of alcohol and collectively are known as ‘boater fatigue’. Persons with ‘boater fatigue’ are at a greater risk of drowning should they fall into the water and that goes equally for skipper, crew or passenger. The blood alcohol limits are the same on the water as on our roads. A person in charge of a vessel must keep under the 0.05 blood alcohol limit and for commercial vessel operators and persons under the age of 18, the lower blood alcohol limit of 0.02 applies.

It was established in 1962, as the German section of the ""Freedom from Hunger Campaign"", one of the world's first initiatives aimed at the eradication of hunger. What we do We fight for the eradication of hunger and poverty. Our aim is to render our work unnecessary. We provide aid from a single source: From rapid disaster relief to long-term development cooperation projects. In 2015, we were able to support 7.3 million people with 387 overseas projects in 40 countries. Since its establishment, Welthungerhilfe has supported more than 8,120 overseas projects with around 3.03 billion Euro, 5,746 of which have been self-help projects (more facts and figures in the latest annual report). How we work Help to self-help is our guiding principle; together with local partner organisations we strengthen structures on a grassroots level and ensure a long-term success of our projects. Moreover, we inform the public and advise politics – nationally and internationally. We thus fight for change of the circumstances that lead to hunger and poverty.

It is an independent, not-for-profit, global organisation, supported by government and NGO membership from around the world. Based mostly in the developing world, it has 20 regional, national or project offices in all continents and a head office in Ede, the Netherlands. The NGO works in over 100 countries and at different scales to tackle problems affecting wetlands. With the support of dozens of governmental, NGO and corporate donors and partners, it supports about 80 projects.[1] Wetlands International's work ranges from research and community-based field projects to advocacy and engagement with governments, corporate and international policy fora and conventions. Wetlands International works through partnerships and is supported by contributions from an extensive specialist expert network and thousands of volunteers.

Later, the name became International Waterfowl & Wetlands Research Bureau (IWRB). The scope became wider; besides waterbirds, the organisation was also working on the protection of wetland areas. Later, organisations with similar objectives emerged in Asia and the Americas: the Asian Wetland Bureau (AWB) (initiated as INTERWADER in 1983) and Wetlands for the Americas (WA) (initiated in 1989). In 1991, the three organisations started to work closely together. In 1995, the working relation developed into the global organisation Wetlands International.[2] Wetlands International works in many thematic areas throughout the world, including the links between peatlands and climate change, as well as wetlands and waterbird migration, based on extensive research as well as field projects.[3] It coordinates the International Waterbird Census, a large-scale citizen science project with decades of data.[4] Key areas of work[edit] Currently, Wetlands International has four strong areas of work, which are: Peatlands[edit] Wetlands International's peatlands work is focused in Eurasia and southeast Asia. The peatswamp forests of Central Kalimantan are studied and worked on in particular for climate mitigation.[5] The project Restoring peatlands in Russia is a joint-effort with the government and Greifeswald University, and was recognised by the UNFCCC with a Momentum for Change award in 2017, for storing up to 200,000 tonnes CO2e of carbon emissions every year by rewetting peatlands and preventing fires. [1] In the severely degraded peat lands of Central Kalimantan (Indonesia), drainage canals and logging have had disastrous impacts in an attempt to convert the unsuitable peatswamps into rice fields. By building small dams and blocks, the drainage of the area was stopped, preventing further oxidation of the peat soil. The area was then reforested with native tree species and community fire brigades to prevent the island's huge problem of peat fires. China’s Ruoergai marshes[edit] Previous work in China has included the Ruoergai marshes,[6] and new work is looking at the Yellow Sea/Bohai migratory bird flyway.[7] Runoff from the glaciers in the Himalayas towards China’s lowland is regulated and stored in the Ruoergai marshes. The Wetlands International China office worked to have this peatland declared a Ramsar site, giving the Chinese government the obligation to protect the area. Furthermore, because of the work with the local Chinese authorities in measuring the impact of different management options, peat mining and drainage are now no longer allowed in Ruoergai and the neighbouring counties.[8] This also leads to improved water supply to the Yellow River and Yangtze River. Turberas of Tierra del Fuego, Argentina[edit] In Tierra del Fuego, Argentina, the Wetlands International Latin America office built awareness of sustainable use of the peatlands from the local to the national level, which have contributed to their protection. Coastal wetlands[edit] Coastal wetlands such as mangrove forests and coral reefs reduce the impact of storms. Mangroves can even cope with sea level rise and provide protection from impacts of waves. Dryland regions[edit] In dryland regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, less rainfall and longer droughts increase the already huge importance of the Sahelian wetlands, and at the same time threaten overexploitation of these areas. Wetlands International works in Mali to improve the livelihoods and water provision of communities in the Inner Niger Delta in a changing climate. Biodiversity and waterbirds[edit] Wetlands International works to protect and restore the rich biodiversity of wetlands. Millions of waterbirds depend on wetlands like marshes, lakes and coastal zones.[9] Wetlands International coordinates an International Waterbird Census in most countries of the world outside the USA where it approximates to the Christmas Bird Count run by the Audubon Society. The census takes place in 143 countries, divided into five regions, visiting 15,000 sites over 60 years.[10] Promoting the protecting of wetlands along the flyways of waterbirds[edit] Wetlands International promotes the establishment of ecological networks of well managed, protected wetlands, along the main flyway routes of migratory waterbirds. These wetlands provide stepping stones for migratory waterbirds; crucial for their survival. Wetlands International supports international governmental agreements to create these networks.[11][12] See also[edit] Wetlands portal America's Wetland Foundation References[edit] ^ ""Annual Review and Accounts 2017"".

The Commonwealth is bordered by Delaware to the southeast, Maryland to the south, West Virginia to the southwest, Ohio to the west, Lake Erie and the Canadian province of Ontario to the northwest, New York to the north, and New Jersey to the east, while the Appalachian Mountains run through its middle. Pennsylvania is the 33rd-largest state by area, and the 5th-most populous state with a total population of 13,011,844[5] according to the most recent official U.S. Census count in 2020. It is the 9th-most densely populated of the 50 states. Pennsylvania's two most populous cities are Philadelphia (1,580,863), and Pittsburgh (302,407). The state capital and its 13th-largest city is Harrisburg. Pennsylvania has 140 miles (225 km) of waterfront along Lake Erie and the Delaware River.[8] The state is one of the Thirteen original founding states of the United States; it came into being in 1681 as a result of a royal land grant to William Penn, the son of the state's namesake. Part of Pennsylvania (along the Delaware River), together with the present State of Delaware, had earlier been organized as the Colony of New Sweden. It was the second state to ratify the United States Constitution, on December 12, 1787. Independence Hall, where the United States Declaration of Independence and United States Constitution were drafted, is located in Philadelphia, the state's largest city. During the American Civil War, the Battle of Gettysburg was fought in the south central region of the state. Valley Forge near Philadelphia was General Washington's headquarters during the bitter winter of 1777–78.

New Sweden claimed and, for the most part, controlled the lower Delaware River region (parts of present-day Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania) but settled few colonists there.[21][22] On March 12, 1664, King Charles II of England gave James, Duke of York a grant that incorporated all lands included in the original Virginia Company of Plymouth Grant plus other lands. This grant was in conflict with the Dutch claim for New Netherland, which included parts of today's Pennsylvania.[23] On June 24, 1664, the Duke of York sold the portion of his large grant that included present-day New Jersey to John Berkeley and George Carteret for a proprietary colony. The land was not yet in British possession, but the sale boxed in the portion of New Netherland on the West side of the Delaware River. The British conquest of New Netherland began on August 29, 1664, when New Amsterdam was coerced to surrender while facing cannons on British ships in New York Harbor.[24][25] This conquest continued, and was completed in October 1664, when the British captured Fort Casimir in what today is New Castle, Delaware. John Dickinson The Peace of Breda between England, France and the Netherlands confirmed the English conquest on July 21, 1667,[26][27] although there were temporary reversions. On September 12, 1672, during the Third Anglo-Dutch War, the Dutch re-conquered New York Colony/New Amsterdam, establishing three County Courts, which went on to become original Counties in present-day Delaware and Pennsylvania. The one that later transferred to Pennsylvania was Upland.[28] This was partially reversed on February 9, 1674, when the Treaty of Westminster ended the Third Anglo-Dutch War, and reverted all political situations to the status quo ante bellum. The British retained the Dutch Counties with their Dutch names.[29] By June 11, 1674, New York reasserted control over the outlying colonies, including Upland, but the names started to be changed to British names by November 11, 1674.[30] Upland was partitioned on November 12, 1674, producing the general outline of the current border between Pennsylvania and Delaware.[31] On February 28, 1681, Charles II granted a land charter[32] to William Penn to repay a debt of £16,000[33] (around £2,100,000 in 2008, adjusting for retail inflation)[34] owed to William's father, Admiral William Penn. This was one of the largest land grants to an individual in history.[35] The King named it Pennsylvania (literally ""Penn's Woods"") in honor of Admiral Penn; the Admiral's son who proposed that the land be called New Wales and then, after objections, Sylvania (from the Latin silva: ""forest, woods""), was embarrassed at the change from the latter proposed form, fearing that people would think he had named it after himself, but King Charles would not rename the grant.[36] Penn established a government with two innovations that were much copied in the New World: the county commission and freedom of religious conviction.[35] What had been Upland on what became the Pennsylvania side of the Pennsylvania-Delaware Border was renamed as Chester County when Pennsylvania instituted their colonial governments on March 4, 1681.[37][38] The Quaker leader William Penn had signed a peace treaty with Tammany, leader of the Delaware tribe, beginning a long period of friendly relations between the Quakers and the Indians.[39] Additional treaties between Quakers and other tribes followed. The treaty of William Penn was never violated.[40][41][42] 18th century[edit] Main articles: French and Indian War, Treaty of Paris (1763), Indian Reserve (1763), Pennsylvania in the American Revolution, First Continental Congress, American Revolutionary War, Second Continental Congress, Lee Resolution, United States Declaration of Independence, Philadelphia campaign, Articles of Confederation § Ratification, Treaty of Paris (1783), Constitutional Convention (United States), Admission to the Union, and List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union Between 1730 and when it was shut down by Parliament with the Currency Act of 1764, the Pennsylvania Colony made its own paper money to account for the shortage of actual gold and silver. The paper money was called Colonial Scrip. The Colony issued ""bills of credit"", which were as good as gold or silver coins because of their legal tender status. Since they were issued by the government and not a banking institution, it was an interest-free proposition, largely defraying the expense of the government and therefore taxation of the people. It also promoted general employment and prosperity, since the Government used discretion and did not issue too much to inflate the currency. Benjamin Franklin had a hand in creating this currency, of which he said its utility was never to be disputed, and it also met with the ""cautious approval"" of Adam Smith.[43] James Smith wrote that in 1763, ""the Indians again commenced hostilities, and were busily engaged in killing and scalping the frontier inhabitants in various parts of Pennsylvania."" Further, ""This state was then a Quaker government, and at the first of this war the frontiers received no assistance from the state.""[44] The ensuing hostilities became known as Pontiac's War. After the Stamp Act Congress of 1765, Delegate John Dickinson of Philadelphia wrote the Declaration of Rights and Grievances. The Congress was the first meeting of the Thirteen Colonies, called at the request of the Massachusetts Assembly, but only nine colonies sent delegates.[45] Dickinson then wrote Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania, To the Inhabitants of the British Colonies, which were published in the Pennsylvania Chronicle between December 2, 1767, and February 15, 1768.[46] When the Founding Fathers of the United States convened in Philadelphia in 1774, 12 colonies sent representatives to the First Continental Congress.[47] The Second Continental Congress, which also met in Philadelphia (in May 1775), drew up and signed the Declaration of Independence in Philadelphia,[48] but when that city was captured by the British, the Continental Congress escaped westward, meeting at the Lancaster courthouse on Saturday, September 27, 1777, and then to York. There they and its primary author, John Dickinson, drew up the Articles of Confederation that formed 13 independent States[49] into a new union. Later, the Constitution was written, and Philadelphia was once again chosen to be cradle to the new American Union.[50] The Constitution was drafted and signed at the Pennsylvania State House, now known as Independence Hall, and the same building where the Declaration of Independence was signed.[51] Pennsylvania became the first large state, and the second state to ratify the U.S. Constitution on December 12, 1787,[52] five days after Delaware became the first. At the time it was the most ethnically and religiously diverse of the thirteen States. Because one-third of Pennsylvania's population spoke German, the Constitution was presented in German to include those citizens in the discussion. Reverend Frederick Muhlenberg acted as the chairman of the state's ratifying convention.[53] Dickinson College of Carlisle was the first college founded after the States united. Established in 1773, the college was ratified five days after the Treaty of Paris on September 9, 1783. The school was founded by Benjamin Rush and named after John Dickinson. The ""Hills Capitol"", used from 1821 until it burned down in 1897 For half a century, the Commonwealth's General Assembly (legislature) met at various places in the general Philadelphia area before starting to meet regularly in Independence Hall in Philadelphia for 63 years.[54] But it needed a more central location, as for example the Paxton Boys massacres of 1763 had made the legislature aware. So, in 1799 the General Assembly moved to the Lancaster Courthouse,[54] and finally in 1812 to Harrisburg.[54] 19th century[edit] The General Assembly met in the old Dauphin County Court House until December 1821,[54] when the Federal-style ""Hills Capitol"" (named for its builder, Stephen Hills, a Lancaster architect) was constructed on a hilltop land grant of four acres set aside for a seat of state government by the prescient, entrepreneurial son and namesake of John Harris, Sr., a Yorkshire native who had founded a trading post in 1705 and ferry (1733) on the east shore of the Susquehanna River.[55] The Hills Capitol burned down on February 2, 1897, during a heavy snowstorm, presumably because of a faulty flue.[54] The General Assembly met at Grace Methodist Church on State Street (still standing) until a new capitol could be built. Following an architectural selection contest that many alleged had been ""rigged"", Chicago architect Henry Ives Cobb was charged with designing and building a replacement building; however, the legislature had little money to allocate to the project, and a roughly finished, somewhat industrial building (the Cobb Capitol) was completed. The General Assembly refused to occupy the building. Political and popular indignation in 1901 prompted a second contest that was restricted to Pennsylvania architects, and Joseph Miller Huston of Philadelphia was chosen to design the present Pennsylvania State Capitol that incorporated Cobb's building into magnificent public work finished and dedicated in 1907.[54] The new state Capitol drew rave reviews.[54] Its dome was inspired by the domes of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome and the United States Capitol.[54] President Theodore Roosevelt called it ""the most beautiful state Capital in the nation"" and said, ""It's the handsomest building I ever saw"" at the dedication. In 1989, The New York Times praised it as ""grand, even awesome at moments, but it is also a working building, accessible to citizens ... a building that connects with the reality of daily life"".[54] James Buchanan, of Franklin County, the only bachelor president of the United States (1857–1861),[56] was the only one to be born in Pennsylvania. The Battle of Gettysburg—the major turning point of the Civil War—took place near Gettysburg.[57] An estimated 350,000 Pennsylvanians served in the Union Army forces including 8,600 African American military volunteers. Pennsylvania was also the home of the first commercially drilled oil well. In 1859, near Titusville, Pennsylvania, Edwin Drake successfully drilled the well, which led to the first major oil boom in United States history. 20th century[edit] This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (June 2016) Franklin D. Roosevelt's FERA camp for unemployed women, 1934 At the beginning of the 20th century, Pennsylvania's economy centered on steel production, logging, coal mining, textile production and other forms of industrial manufacturing. A surge in immigration to the U.S. during the late 19th and early 20th centuries provided a steady flow of cheap labor for these industries, which often employed children and people who could not speak English. In 1923, President Calvin Coolidge established the Allegheny National Forest under the authority of the Weeks Act of 1911.[58] The forest is located in the northwest part of the state in Elk, Forest, McKean, and Warren Counties for the purposes of timber production and watershed protection in the Allegheny River basin. The Allegheny is the state's only national forest.[59] The Three Mile Island accident was the most significant nuclear accident in U.S. commercial nuclear power plant history.[60][61] 21st century[edit] United Airlines Flight 93 crashed into a field near Shanksville during the September 11th attacks, killing 44. Within the first half of 2003, the annual Tekko commences in Pittsburgh.[62] In October 2018, the Tree of Life – Or L'Simcha Congregation experienced the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting.[63] Geography[edit] Further information: Geography of Pennsylvania and List of counties in Pennsylvania Worlds End State Park, Sullivan County Pennsylvania is 170 miles (274 km) north to south and 283 miles (455 km) east to west.[64] Of a total 46,055 square miles (119,282 km2), 44,817 square miles (116,075 km2) are land, 490 square miles (1,269 km2) are inland waters, and 749 square miles (1,940 km2) are waters in Lake Erie.[65] It is the 33rd-largest state in the United States.[66] Pennsylvania has 51 miles (82 km)[67] of coastline along Lake Erie and 57 miles (92 km)[8] of shoreline along the Delaware Estuary. Of the original Thirteen Colonies, Pennsylvania is the only state that does not border the Atlantic Ocean. The boundaries of the state are the Mason–Dixon line (39°43' N) to the south, the Twelve-Mile Circle on the Pennsylvania-Delaware border, the Delaware River to the east, 80°31' W to the west and the 42° N to the north, except for a short segment on the western end, where a triangle extends north to Lake Erie. Cities include Philadelphia, Reading, Lebanon and Lancaster in the southeast, Pittsburgh in the southwest, and the tri-cities of Allentown, Bethlehem, and Easton in the central east (known as the Lehigh Valley). The northeast includes the former anthracite coal mining cities of Scranton, Wilkes-Barre, Pittston, Nanticoke, and Hazleton. Erie is located in the northwest. State College serves the central region while Williamsport serves the commonwealth's north-central region as does Chambersburg in the south-central region, with York, Carlisle, and the state capital Harrisburg on the Susquehanna River in the east-central region of the Commonwealth and Altoona and Johnstown in the west-central region. The state has five geographical regions, namely the Allegheny Plateau, Ridge and Valley, Atlantic Coastal Plain, Piedmont, and the Erie Plain. Adjacent states and province[edit] Ontario (Province of Canada) (Northwest) New York (North and Northeast) New Jersey (East and Southeast) Delaware (Extreme Southeast) Maryland (South) West Virginia (Southwest) Ohio (West) Climate[edit] Main article: Climate of Pennsylvania Köppen climate types of Pennsylvania Autumn in North Branch Township, Wyoming County, Pennsylvania Pennsylvania's diverse topography also produces a variety of climates, though the entire state experiences cold winters and humid summers. Straddling two major zones, the majority of the state, except for the southeastern corner, has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfb). The southern portion of the state has a humid subtropical climate. The largest city, Philadelphia, has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cfa) though with noticeably colder, snowier winters than most locations featuring this climate. Summers are generally hot and humid. Moving toward the mountainous interior of the state, the winter climate becomes colder, the number of cloudy days increases, and snowfall amounts are greater. Western areas of the state, particularly locations near Lake Erie, can receive over 100 inches (250 cm) of snowfall annually, and the entire state receives plentiful precipitation throughout the year. The state may be subject to severe weather from spring through summer into autumn. Tornadoes occur annually in the state, sometimes in large numbers, such as 30 recorded tornadoes in 2011; generally speaking, these tornadoes do not cause significant damage.[68] Monthly Average High and Low Temperatures For Various Pennsylvania Cities (in °F) City Jan.

The most populous county in Pennsylvania is Philadelphia, while the least populous is Cameron (5,085).[76] There are a total of 56 cities in Pennsylvania, which are classified, by population, as either first-, second-, or third-class cities.[74][77] Philadelphia, Pennsylvania's largest city, has a population of 1,526,006 and is the state's only first-class city.[75] Pittsburgh (305,704) and Scranton (76,089) are second-class and second-class 'A' cities, respectively.[75] The rest of the cities, like the third and fourth-largest—Allentown (120,443) and Erie (98,593)—to the smallest—Parker with a population of only 820—are third-class cities.[78] First- and second-class cities are governed by a ""strong mayor"" form of mayor–council government, whereas third-class cities are governed by either a ""weak mayor"" form of government or a council–manager government.[75] Boroughs are generally smaller than cities, with most Pennsylvania cities having been incorporated as a borough before being incorporated as a city.[75] There are 958  boroughs in Pennsylvania, all of which are governed by the ""weak mayor"" form of mayor-council government.[74][75] The largest borough in Pennsylvania is State College (41,992) and the smallest is Centralia. Townships are the third type of municipality in Pennsylvania and are classified as either first-class or second-class townships. There are 1,454 second-class townships and 93 first-class townships.[79] Second-class townships can become first-class townships if they have a population density greater than 300 inhabitants per square mile (120/km2) and a referendum is passed supporting the change.[79] Pennsylvania's largest township is Upper Darby Township (82,629), and the smallest is East Keating Township. There is one exception to the types of municipalities in Pennsylvania: Bloomsburg was incorporated as a town in 1870 and is, officially, the only town in the state.[80] In 1975, McCandless Township adopted a home-rule charter under the name of ""Town of McCandless"", but is, legally, still a first-class township.[81] The total of 56 cities, 958 boroughs, 93 first-class townships, 1,454 second-class townships, and one town (Bloomsburg) is 2,562 municipalities.

Net migration to other states resulted in a decrease of 27,718, and immigration from other countries resulted in an increase of 127,007. Net migration to the Commonwealth was 98,289. Migration of native Pennsylvanians resulted in a decrease of 100,000 people. From 2008 to 2012, 5.8% of the population was foreign-born.[84] Place of origin[edit] John Morton (1725–1777), a Pennsylvanian jurist and one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, had Finnish roots;[85] Morton, which was an anglicized version of the family's original Finnish name Marttinen, came to America from Rautalampi municipality of North Savonia, Finland.[86][87][88] Of the people residing in Pennsylvania, 74.5% were born in Pennsylvania, 18.4% were born in a different U.S. state, 1.5% were born in Puerto Rico, U.S. Island areas, or born abroad to American parent(s), and 5.6% were foreign born.[89] Foreign-born Pennsylvanians are largely from Asia (36.0%), Europe (35.9%), and Latin America (30.6%), with the remainder from Africa (5%), North America (3.1%), and Oceania (0.4%). The largest ancestry groups are listed below, expressed as a percentage of total people who responded with a particular ancestry for the 2010 census:[90][91] German 28.5% Irish 18.2% Italian 12.8% African American 9.6% English 8.5% Polish 7.2% French 4.2% Racial breakdown[edit] Pennsylvania Racial Breakdown of Population Racial composition 1990[92] 2000[93] 2010[94] White 88.5% 85.4% 81.9% Black 9.2% 10.0% 10.9% Asian 1.2% 1.8% 2.8% Native 0.1% 0.1% 0.2% Native Hawaiian andother Pacific Islander – – – Other race 1.0% 1.5% 2.4% Two or more races – 1.2% 1.9% As of 2011, 32.1% of Pennsylvania's population younger than age 1 were minorities.[95] Pennsylvania's Hispanic population grew by 82.6% between 2000 and 2010, making it one of the largest increases in a state's Hispanic population. The significant growth of the Hispanic population is due to immigration to the state mainly from Puerto Rico, which is a US territory, but to a lesser extent from countries such as the Dominican Republic, Mexico, and various Central and South American nations, as well as from the wave of Hispanics leaving New York and New Jersey for safer and more affordable living. The Asian population swelled by almost 60%, which was fueled by Indian, Vietnamese, and Chinese immigration, as well the many Asian transplants moving to Philadelphia from New York. The rapid growth of this community has given Pennsylvania one of the largest Asian populations in the nation by numerical values. The Black and African American population grew by 13%, which was the largest increase in that population amongst the state's peers (New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Illinois, and Michigan). Twelve other states saw decreases in their White populations.[96] The state has a high in-migration of black and Hispanic people from other nearby states, with eastern and south-central portions of the state seeing the bulk of the increases.[76][97] The majority of Hispanics in Pennsylvania are of Puerto Rican descent, having one of the largest and fastest-growing Puerto Rican populations in the country.[98][99] Most of the remaining Hispanic population is made up of Mexicans and Dominicans. Most Hispanics are concentrated in Philadelphia, Lehigh Valley and South Central Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania's reported population of Hispanics, especially among the Black race, has markedly increased in recent years.[100] The Hispanic population is greatest in Bethlehem, Allentown, Reading, Lancaster, York, and around Philadelphia. It is not clear how much of this change reflects a changing population and how much reflects increased willingness to self-identify minority status. As of 2010, it is estimated that about 85% of all Hispanics in Pennsylvania live within a 150-mile (240 km) radius of Philadelphia, with about 20% living within the city itself. Of the black population, the vast majority in the state are African American, being descendants of African slaves brought to the US south during the colonial era. There are also a growing number of blacks of West Indian, recent African, and Hispanic origins.[101] Most blacks live in the Philadelphia area, Pittsburgh, and South Central Pennsylvania. Whites make up the majority of Pennsylvania; they are mostly descended from German, Irish, Scottish, Welsh, Italian, and English immigrants. Rural portions of South Central Pennsylvania are famous nationwide for their notable Amish communities. The Wyoming Valley, consisting of Scranton and Wilkes-Barre, has the highest percentage of white residents of any metropolitan area (with a population of 500,000 or above) in the U.S., with 96.2% of its population claiming to be white with no Hispanic background. The center of population of Pennsylvania is located in Perry County, in the borough of Duncannon.[102] State population from 1790 to 2000 Pennsylvania's population distribution Age and poverty[edit] The state had the fourth-highest proportion of elderly (65+) citizens in 2010—15.4%, as compared to 13.0% nationwide.[103] According to U.S. Census Bureau estimates, the state's poverty rate was 12.5% in 2017, compared to 13.4% for the United States as a whole.[104] Population Aged 65 and Older: Top 10 States[103] State % of population Florida 17.3 West Virginia 16.0 Maine 15.9 Pennsylvania 15.4 Iowa 14.9 Montana 14.8 Vermont 14.6 North Dakota 14.5 Rhode Island 14.4 Arkansas 14.4 Birth data[edit] Note: Births in table do not add up because Hispanics are counted both by their ethnicity and by their race, giving a higher overall number.

Languages[edit] Top 10 Non-English Languages Spoken in Pennsylvania Language Percentage of population(as of 2010)[112] Spanish 4.1% German (including Pennsylvania German) 0.9% Chinese (including Mandarin) 0.5% Italian 0.4% French 0.3% Russian 0.3% Vietnamese 0.3% Korean 0.3% Polish 0.2% Arabic 0.2% Hindi 0.2% As of 2010, 90.2% (10,710,239) of Pennsylvania residents age 5 and older spoke English at home as a primary language, while 4.1% (486,058) spoke Spanish, 0.8% (103,502) German (which includes Pennsylvania Dutch) and 0.5% (56,052) Chinese (which includes Mandarin) of the population over the age of five. In total, 9.9% (1,170,628) of Pennsylvania's population age 5 and older spoke a mother language other than English.[112] Pennsylvania German language[edit] Main article: Pennsylvania German language Pennsylvania German is often—even though misleadingly—called ""Pennsylvania Dutch"". The term Dutch used to mean ""German""[113] (including the Netherlands), before the Latin name for them replaced it (but stuck with the Netherlands). When referring to the language spoken by the Pennsylvania Dutch people (Pennsylvania German) it means ""German"" or ""Teutonic"" rather than ""Netherlander"". Germans, in their own language, call themselves ""Deutsch"", (Pennsylvania German: ""Deitsch""). The Pennsylvania German language is a descendant of German, in the West Central German dialect family. It is closest to Palatine German. Pennsylvania German is still very vigorous as a first language among Old Order Amish and Old Order Mennonites (principally in the Lancaster County area), whereas it is almost extinct as an everyday language outside the plain communities, though a few words have passed into English usage. Religion[edit] Religion in Pennsylvania (2014)[114] religion percent Protestant 47% Catholic 24% Unaffiliated 21% Other faiths/don't know 2% Hindu 1% Jehovah's witnesses 1% Jewish 0.8% Muslim 0.6% An Amish family riding in a traditional Amish buggy Of all the colonies, only Rhode Island had religious freedom as secure as in Pennsylvania.[115] Voltaire, writing of William Penn in 1733, observed: ""The new sovereign also enacted several wise and wholesome laws for his colony, which have remained invariably the same to this day. The chief is, to ill-treat no person on account of religion, and to consider as brethren all those who believe in one God.""[116] One result of this uncommon freedom was a wide religious diversity, which continues to the present. Pennsylvania's population in 2010 was 12,702,379. Of these, 6,838,440 (53.8%) were estimated to belong to some sort of organized religion. According to the Association of religion data archives (ARDA) at Pennsylvania State University, the largest religions in Pennsylvania by adherents are the Roman Catholic Church with 3,503,028 adherents, the United Methodist Church with 591,734 members, and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America with 501,974 members. Pennsylvania, especially in the west and in the Pittsburgh area, has one of the largest communities of Presbyterians in the nation, being the third highest by percentage of population and the largest outright in membership.[117] The Presbyterian Church (USA), with about 250,000 members and 1,011 congregations, is the largest church, while the Presbyterian Church in America is also significant, with 112 congregations and 23,000 adherents; the EPC has around 50 congregations, as well as the ECO. The fourth-largest Protestant denomination, the United Church of Christ, has 180,000 members and 627 congregations. American Baptist Churches USA (Northern Baptist Convention) is based in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania was the center state of the German Reformed denomination from the 1700s.[118] Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, is one of the headquarters of the Moravian Church in America. Pennsylvania also has a very large Amish population, second only to Ohio among the states.[119] In the year 2000 there was a total Amish population of 47,860 in Pennsylvania and a further 146,416 Mennonites and 91,200 Brethren. The total Anabapist population including Bruderhof[120] was 232,631, about two percent of the population.[121] While Pennsylvania owes its existence to Quakers, and much of the historic character of the Commonwealth is ideologically rooted in the teachings of the Religious Society of Friends (as they are officially known), practicing Quakers are a small minority of about 10,000 adherents in 2010.[122] As of 2014[update], the religious affiliations of the people of Pennsylvania are:[114] Christian 73% Protestant 47% Mainline Protestant 23% Evangelical Protestant 19% Black Protestant 5% Roman Catholic 24% Jehovah's Witnesses 1% Orthodox Christian <1% Non-religious/Unaffiliated 21% Judaism 1% Islam 1% Hinduism 1% Other 2% Don't know/Refused to say 1% According to a 2016 Gallup poll, 38% of Pennsylvanians are very religious, 29% are moderately religious, and 34% are non-religious.[123] Economy[edit] It has been suggested that this section be split out into another article titled Economy of Pennsylvania. (Discuss) (September 2020) See also: List of Pennsylvania counties by per capita income Pennsylvania was home of two of the largest steel producers in the world; Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel and Bethlehem-based Bethlehem Steel. The former blast furnace sites have either been destroyed, preserved, or in the case of Bethlehem, became a new multi-million dollar Sands Casino Resort (now Wind Creek Bethlehem) in 2009 Pennsylvania's 2018 total gross state product (GSP) of $803 billion ranks the state 6th in the nation.[124] If Pennsylvania were an independent country, its economy would rank as the 19th-largest in the world.[125] On a per-capita basis, Pennsylvania's 2016 per-capita GSP of $50,665 (in chained 2009 dollars) ranks 22nd among the fifty states.[124] Geo map of average income by location in Pennsylvania. Data shown is from the 2014 American Community Survey five-year estimate. Total employment 2016 5,354,964 Total employer establishments 301,484[126] Philadelphia in the southeast corner, Pittsburgh in the southwest corner, Erie in the northwest corner, Scranton-Wilkes-Barre in the northeast corner, and Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton in the east central region are urban manufacturing centers. Much of the Commonwealth is rural; this dichotomy affects state politics as well as the state economy.[127] Philadelphia is home to six Fortune 500 companies,[128] with more located in suburbs like King of Prussia; it is a leader in the financial[129] and insurance industry. Pittsburgh is home to eight Fortune 500 companies, including U.S. Steel, PPG Industries, and H.J. Heinz.[128] In all, Pennsylvania is home to fifty Fortune 500 companies.[128] Hershey is home to The Hershey Company, one of the largest chocolate manufacturers in the world. Erie is also home to GE Transportation, which is the largest producer of train locomotives in the United States. As in the US as a whole and in most states, the largest private employer in the Commonwealth is Walmart, followed by the University of Pennsylvania.[130][131] Pennsylvania is also home to the oldest investor-owned utility company in the US, The York Water Company. As of May 2020, the state's unemployment rate is 13.1%.[132] Year 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 GDP in mil.

After a series of mergers, the Bank of North America is part of Wells Fargo, which uses national charter 1. Pennsylvania is also the home to the first nationally chartered bank under the 1863 National Banking Act. That year, the Pittsburgh Savings & Trust Company received a national charter and renamed itself the First National Bank of Pittsburgh as part of the National Banking Act. That bank is still in existence today as PNC Financial Services and remains based in Pittsburgh. PNC is the state's largest bank and the sixth-largest in the United States. Agriculture[edit] Main article: Agriculture in Pennsylvania Pennsylvania ranks 19th overall in agricultural production.[136] The 1st is mushroom production, The 2nd is apples, The 3rd is Christmas trees and layer chickens, The 4th is nursery and sod, milk, corn for silage, grapes grown (including juice grapes), and horses production. It also ranks 8th in the nation in winemaking.[137] The Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture worked with private companies to establish ""PA Preferred"" as a way to brand agricultural products grown or made in the state to support and promote Pennsylvania products and locally grown food.[138] The financial impact of agriculture in Pennsylvania[139] includes employment of more than 66,800 people employed by the food manufacturing industry; and over $1.7 billion in food product export (in 2011). Gambling[edit] Main article: Gambling in Pennsylvania Casino gambling was legalized in Pennsylvania in 2004. Currently, there are nine casinos across the state with three under construction or in planning. Only horse racing, slot machines and electronic table games were legal in Pennsylvania, although a bill to legalize table games was being negotiated in the fall of 2009.[140] Table games such as poker, roulette, blackjack, and craps were finally approved by the state legislature in January 2010, being signed into law by the Governor on January 7. Former Governor Ed Rendell had considered legalizing video poker machines in bars and private clubs in 2009 since an estimated 17,000 operate illegally across the state.[141] Under this plan, any establishment with a liquor license would be allowed up to five machines. All machines would be connected to the state's computer system, like commercial casinos. The state would impose a 50% tax on net gambling revenues, after winning players have been paid, with the remaining 50% going to the establishment owners. Film[edit] The Pennsylvania Film Production Tax Credit began in 2004 and stimulated the development of a film industry in the state.[142] Governance[edit] Tom Wolf (D) 47th GovernorSince January 20, 2015John Fetterman (D) 34th Lt. GovernorSince January 15, 2019 Main article: Government of Pennsylvania See also: Commonwealth (U.S. state) Counties of Pennsylvania Pennsylvania has had five constitutions during its statehood:[143] 1776, 1790, 1838, 1874, and 1968. Before that the province of Pennsylvania was governed for a century by a Frame of Government, of which there were four versions: 1682, 1683, 1696, and 1701.[143] The capital of Pennsylvania is Harrisburg. The legislature meets in the State Capitol there. Executive[edit] Main article: List of Governors of Pennsylvania The current Governor is Tom Wolf. The other elected officials composing the executive branch are the Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman, Attorney General Joshua Shapiro, Auditor General Timothy DeFoor, and Pennsylvania Treasurer Stacy Garrity. The Governor and Lieutenant Governor run as a ticket in the general election and are up for re-election every four years during the midterm elections. The elections for Attorney General, Auditor General, and Treasurer are held every four years coinciding with a Presidential election.[144]See also: List of Pennsylvania state agencies Legislative[edit] Main article: Pennsylvania General Assembly The Pennsylvania State Capitol in Harrisburg. Pennsylvania has a bicameral legislature set up by Commonwealth's constitution in 1790. The original Frame of Government of William Penn had a unicameral legislature.[145] The General Assembly includes 50 Senators and 203 Representatives. Joe Scarnati is currently President Pro Tempore of the State Senate, Jake Corman the Majority Leader, and Jay Costa the Minority Leader.[146] Bryan Cutler is Speaker of the House of Representatives, with Kerry A. Benninghoff as Majority Leader and Frank Dermody as Minority Leader.[147] As of the 2018 elections, the Republicans hold the majority in the State House and Senate. Judiciary[edit] Main article: Unified Judicial System of Pennsylvania Pennsylvania is divided into 60 judicial districts,[148] most of which (except Philadelphia) have magisterial district judges (formerly called district justices and justices of the peace), who preside mainly over preliminary hearings in felony and misdemeanor offenses, all minor (summary) criminal offenses, and small civil claims.[148] Most criminal and civil cases originate in the Courts of Common Pleas, which also serve as appellate courts to the district judges and for local agency decisions.[148] The Superior Court hears all appeals from the Courts of Common Pleas not expressly designated to the Commonwealth Court or Supreme Court. It also has original jurisdiction to review warrants for wiretap surveillance.[148] The Commonwealth Court is limited to appeals from final orders of certain state agencies and certain designated cases from the Courts of Common Pleas.[148] The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania is the final appellate court. All judges in Pennsylvania are elected; the chief justice is determined by seniority.[148] State law enforcement[edit] The Pennsylvania State Police is the chief law enforcement agency in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Politics[edit] Main article: Politics of Pennsylvania The 2016 Democratic National Convention was held in Philadelphia. Since the latter half of the 20th century, Pennsylvania has been a powerful swing state. It supported the losing candidate in a presidential election only twice between 1932 to 1988, faltering in 1932 and 1968 with Herbert Hoover and Hubert Humphrey, respectively. Between 1992 and 2016, Pennsylvania trended Democratic in presidential elections, voting for Bill Clinton twice by large margins, and by a slightly closer margin for Al Gore in 2000. In the 2004 presidential election, Senator John F. Kerry beat President George W. Bush in Pennsylvania, 2,938,095 (51%) to 2,793,847 (48%). In the 2008 presidential election, Democrat Barack Obama defeated Republican John McCain in Pennsylvania, 3,276,363 (54%) to 2,655,885 (44%). By the 2016 presidential election, Republican Donald Trump broke the Democratic streak of the state, winning by 2,970,733 (48%) votes to 2,926,441 (47%) votes.[149] The state returned to the Democratic column in 2020 by narrowly voting for Joe Biden over Trump, 3,458,229 (50%) to 3,377,674 (49%). The state holds 20 electoral votes.[150] In recent national elections since 1992, Pennsylvania had leaned for the Democratic Party. The state voted for the Democratic ticket for president in every election between 1992 and 2012. During the 2008 election campaign, a recruitment drive saw registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans by 1.2 million. However, Pennsylvania has a history of electing Republican senators. From 2009 to 2011, the state was represented by two Democratic senators for the first time since 1947 after Republican Senator Arlen Specter switched party affiliation. In 2010, Republicans recaptured a U.S. Senate seat as well as a majority of the state's congressional seats, control of both chambers of the state legislature and the governor's mansion. Democrats won back the governor's mansion four years later in the 2014 election. It was the first time since a governor became eligible to succeed himself that an incumbent governor had been defeated for reelection. Voter registration totals as of July 5, 2021[151] Party Registered voters Percentage Democratic 4,039,596 (-189,292) 46.28% Republican 3,419,730 (-123,340) 39.17% Minor parties 1,269,827 (-49,177) 14.54% Total 8,729,153 (-361,809) 100% *Lost between November 3, 2020 and July 5, 2021. Historically, Democratic strength was concentrated in Philadelphia in the southeast, the Pittsburgh and Johnstown areas in the southwest, and Scranton/Wilkes-Barre in the northeast. Republican strength was concentrated in the Philadelphia suburbs, as well as the more rural areas in the central, northeastern, and western portions. The latter counties have long been among the most conservative areas in the nation. Since 1992, however, the Philadelphia suburbs have swung Democratic; the brand of Republicanism there was traditionally a moderate one. The Pittsburgh suburbs, historically a Democratic stronghold, have swung more Republican since the turn of the millennium. Democratic political consultant James Carville once pejoratively described Pennsylvania as ""Philadelphia in the east, Pittsburgh in the west and Alabama in the middle"". Political analysts and editorials refer to central Pennsylvania as the ""T"" in statewide elections. The Three Valleys (Delaware, Lehigh, and Wyoming) and greater Pittsburgh generally vote for Democratic candidates, while the majority of the counties in the central part of the state vote Republican. As a result, maps showing the results of statewide elections invariably form a ""T"" shape. Taxation[edit] Pennsylvania had the 15th-highest state and local tax burden in the United States in 2012, according to the Tax Foundation.[152] Residents paid a total of $83.7 billion in state and local taxes with a per capita average of $4,589 annually. Residents share 76% of the total tax burden. Many state politicians have tried to increase the share of taxes paid by out-of-state sources. Suggested revenue sources include taxing natural gas drilling as Pennsylvania is the only state without such a tax on gas drilling.[153] Additional revenue prospects include trying to place tolls on interstate highways; specifically Interstate 80, which is used heavily by out of state commuters with high maintenance costs.[154] Sales taxes provide 39% of the Commonwealth's revenue; personal income taxes 34%; motor vehicle taxes about 12%, and taxes on cigarettes and alcoholic beverages 5%.[155] The personal income tax is a flat 3.07%. An individual's taxable income is based on the following eight types of income: compensation (salary); interest; dividends; net profits from the operation of a business, profession or farm; net gains or income from the dispositions of property; net gains or income from rents, royalties, patents and copyrights; income derived through estates or trusts; and gambling and lottery winnings (other than Pennsylvania Lottery winnings).[156] Counties, municipalities, and school districts levy taxes on real estate. In addition, some local bodies assess a wage tax on personal income. Generally, the total wage tax rate is capped at 1% of income but some municipalities with home rule charters may charge more than 1%. Thirty-two of the Commonwealth's sixty-seven counties levy a personal property tax on stocks, bonds, and similar holdings. With the exception of the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, municipalities and school districts are allowed to enact a local earned income tax within the purview of Act 32. Residents of these municipalities and school districts are required to file a local income tax return in addition to federal and state returns. This local return is filed with the local income tax collector, a private collection agency appointed by a particular county to collect the local earned income and local services tax (the latter a flat fee deducted from salaried employees working within a particular municipality or school district).[157][158][159][160] The City of Philadelphia has its own local income taxation system. Philadelphia-based employers are required to withhold the Philadelphia wage tax from the salaries of their employees. Residents of Philadelphia working for an employer are not required to file a local return as long as their Philadelphia wage tax is fully withheld by their employer. If their employer does not withhold the Philadelphia wage tax, residents are required to register with the Revenue Department and file an Earnings Tax return. Residents of Philadelphia with self-employment income are required to file a Net Profits Tax (NPT) return, while those with business income from Philadelphia sources are required to obtain a Commercial Activity License (CAL) and pay the Business Income and Receipts Tax (BIRT) and the NPT. Residents with unearned income (except for interest from checking and savings accounts) are required to file and pay the School Income-tax (SIT).[161] The complexity of Pennsylvania's local tax filing system has been criticized by experts, who note that the outsourcing of collections to private entities is akin to tax farming and that many new residents are caught off guard and end up facing ""failure to file"" penalties even if they did not owe any tax. Attempts to transfer local income tax collections to the state level (i.e. by having a separate local section on the state income tax return, currently the method used to collect local income taxes in New York, Maryland, Indiana, and Iowa) have been unsuccessful.[162] Federal representation[edit] Main article: Pennsylvania's congressional districts Pennsylvania's two U.S. Senators are Democrat Bob Casey, Jr. and Republican Pat Toomey. Pennsylvania has 18 seats in the United States House of Representatives, as of the 2010 Census.[163] Health[edit] Pennsylvania has a mixed health record, and is ranked as the 29th-overall-healthiest state according to the 2013 United Health Foundation's Health Rankings.[164] Education[edit] Main article: Education in Pennsylvania Pennsylvania has 500 public school districts, thousands of private schools, publicly funded colleges and universities, and over 100 private institutions of higher education. Primary and secondary education[edit] In general, under state law, school attendance in Pennsylvania is mandatory for a child from the age of 8 until the age of 17, or until graduation from an accredited high school, whichever is earlier.[165] As of 2005, 83.8% of Pennsylvania residents age 18 to 24 have completed high school. Among residents age 25 and over, 86.7% have graduated from high school. The following are the four-year graduation rates for students completing high school in 2016:[166] Cohort All Students Male Female White Hispanic Black Asian Special Education % graduating 86.09 84.14 88.13 90.48 72.83 73.22 91.21 74.06 Additionally, 27.5% have gone on to obtain a bachelor's degree or higher.[167] State students consistently do well in standardized testing. In 2007, Pennsylvania ranked 14th in mathematics, 12th in reading, and 10th in writing for 8th grade students.[168] In 1988, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed Act 169, which allows parents or guardians to homeschool their children as an option for compulsory school attendance. This law specifies the requirements and responsibilities of the parents and the school district where the family lives.[169] Higher education[edit] See also: List of colleges and universities in Pennsylvania The Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE) is the public university system of the Commonwealth, with 14 state-owned schools. West Chester University has by far the largest student body of the 14 universities. The Commonwealth System of Higher Education is an organizing body of the four state-related schools in Pennsylvania; these schools (Pennsylvania State University, Lincoln University, the University of Pittsburgh, and Temple University) are independent institutions that receive some state funding. There are also 15 publicly funded two-year community colleges and technical schools that are separate from the PASSHE system. Additionally, there are many private two- and four-year technical schools, colleges, and universities. Carnegie Mellon University, The Pennsylvania State University, the University of Pennsylvania, and the University of Pittsburgh are members of the Association of American Universities, an invitation-only organization of leading research universities. Lehigh University is a private research university located in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania State University is the Commonwealth's land-grant university, Sea Grant College and, Space Grant College. The University of Pennsylvania, located in Philadelphia, is considered the first university in the United States and established the country's first medical school. The University of Pennsylvania is also the Commonwealth's only, and geographically most southern, Ivy League school. The Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine (LECOM) is a private graduate school of medicine, dentistry, and pharmacy with a main campus in Erie, Pennsylvania, and a branch campus located in Greensburg, Pennsylvania (with two other campuses outside of Pennsylvania). With over 2,200 enrolled medical students, the College of Osteopathic Medicine at LECOM is the largest medical school in the United States.[170][171][172][173] The Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts is the first and oldest art school in the United States.[174] Philadelphia College of Pharmacy, now a part of University of the Sciences in Philadelphia, was the first pharmacy school in the United States.[175] Recreation[edit] Dorney Park and Wildwater Kingdom's Steel Force and Thunderhawk roller coasters in Allentown Pennsylvania is home to the nation's first zoo, the Philadelphia Zoo.[176] Other long-accredited AZA zoos include the Erie Zoo and the Pittsburgh Zoo & PPG Aquarium. The Lehigh Valley Zoo and ZOOAMERICA are other notable zoos. The Commonwealth boasts some of the finest museums in the country, including the Carnegie Museums in Pittsburgh, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and several others. One unique museum is the Houdini Museum in Scranton, the only building in the world devoted to the legendary magician.[177] Pennsylvania is also home to the National Aviary, located in Pittsburgh. All 121 state parks in Pennsylvania feature free admission. Pennsylvania offers a number of notable amusement parks, including Kalahari Resorts Poconos, Camel Beach, Conneaut Lake Park, Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom, Dutch Wonderland, DelGrosso's Amusement Park, Hersheypark, Idlewild Park, Kennywood, Knoebels, Lakemont Park, Sandcastle Waterpark, Sesame Place, Great Wolf Lodge and Waldameer Park. Pennsylvania also is home to the largest indoor waterpark resort on the East Coast, Splash Lagoon in Erie. There are also notable music festivals that take place in Pennsylvania. These include Musikfest and NEARfest in Bethlehem, the Philadelphia Folk Festival, Creation Festival, the Great Allentown Fair, and Purple Door. There are nearly one million licensed hunters in Pennsylvania. Whitetail deer, black bear, cottontail rabbits, squirrel, turkey, and grouse are common game species. Pennsylvania is considered one of the finest wild turkey hunting states in the Union, alongside Texas and Alabama. Sport hunting in Pennsylvania provides a massive boost for the Commonwealth's economy. A report from The Center for Rural Pennsylvania (a Legislative Agency of the Pennsylvania General Assembly) reported that hunting, fishing, and furtaking generated a total of $9.6 billion statewide. The Boone and Crockett Club shows that five of the ten largest (skull size) black bear entries came from the state.[178] The state also has a tied record for the largest hunter shot black bear in the Boone & Crockett books at 733 lb (332 kg) and a skull of 23 3/16 tied with a bear shot in California in 1993.[178] The largest bear ever found dead was in Utah in 1975, and the second-largest was shot by a poacher in the state in 1987.[178] Pennsylvania holds the second-highest number of Boone & Crockett-recorded record black bears at 183, second only to Wisconsin's 299.[178] Transportation[edit] See also: List of airports in Pennsylvania, List of public transit authorities in Pennsylvania, and List of Pennsylvania railroads Road[edit] The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, abbreviated as PennDOT, owns 39,861 miles (64,150 km) of the 121,770 miles (195,970 km) of roadway in the state, making it the fifth-largest state highway system in the United States.[179] The Pennsylvania Turnpike system is 535 miles (861 km) long, with the mainline portion stretching from Ohio to Philadelphia and New Jersey.[179] It is overseen by the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission. Another major east–west route is Interstate 80, which runs primarily in the northern tier of the state from Ohio to New Jersey at the Delaware Water Gap. Interstate 90 travels the relatively short distance between Ohio and New York through Erie County, in the extreme northwestern part of the state. Primary north–south highways are Interstate 79 from its terminus in Erie through Pittsburgh to West Virginia, Interstate 81 from New York through Scranton, Lackawanna County and Harrisburg to Maryland and Interstate 476, which begins 7 miles (11 km) north of the Delaware border, in Chester, Delaware County and travels 132 miles (212 km) to Clarks Summit, Lackawanna County, where it joins I-81. All but 20 miles (32 km) of I-476 is the Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike, while the highway south of the mainline of the Pennsylvania Turnpike is officially called the ""Veterans Memorial Highway"", but is commonly referred to by locals as the ""Blue Route"". Rail[edit] The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) is the sixth-largest transit agency in the United States and operates the commuter, heavy and light rail transit, and transit bus service in the Philadelphia metropolitan area. The Port Authority of Allegheny County is the 25th-largest transit agency and provides transit bus and light rail service in and around Pittsburgh.[180] U.S. Route 220 as it passes through Lamar Township Intercity passenger rail transit is provided by Amtrak, with the majority of traffic occurring on the Keystone Service in the high-speed Keystone Corridor between Harrisburg and Philadelphia's 30th Street Station before heading north to New York City, as well as the Northeast Regional providing frequent high-speed service up and down the Northeast Corridor. The Pennsylvanian follows the same route from New York City to Harrisburg, but extends out to Pittsburgh. The Capitol Limited also passes through Pittsburgh, as well as Connellsville, on its way from Chicago to Washington, D.C.[181] Traveling between Chicago and New York City, the Lake Shore Limited passes through Erie once in each direction.[181] There are 67 short-line, freight railroads operating in Pennsylvania, the highest number in any U.S. state.[181] Bus and coach[edit] Intercity bus service is provided between cities in Pennsylvania and other major points in the Northeast by Bolt Bus, Fullington Trailways, Greyhound Lines, Martz Trailways, Megabus, OurBus, Trans-Bridge Lines, as well as various Chinatown bus companies. In 2018, OurBus began offering service from West Chester, PA – Malvern, PA – King of Prussia, PA – Fort Washington, PA – New York, NY. Air[edit] Pennsylvania has seven major airports: Philadelphia International, Pittsburgh International, Lehigh Valley International, Harrisburg International, Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International, Erie International, and University Park Airport. A total of 134 public-use airports are located in the state.[181] The port of Pittsburgh is the second-largest inland port in the United States and the 18th-largest port overall; the Port of Philadelphia is the 24th-largest port in the United States.[182] Pennsylvania's only port on the Great Lakes is located in Erie. Water[edit] The Allegheny River Lock and Dam Two is the most-used lock operated by the United States Army Corps of Engineers of its 255 nationwide.[183] The dam impounds the Allegheny River near Downtown Pittsburgh.

The first World Series between the Boston Americans (which became the Boston Red Sox) and Pittsburgh Pirates was played in Pittsburgh in 1903. Since 1959, the Little League World Series is held each summer in South Williamsport, near where Little League Baseball was founded in Williamsport.[184] Soccer is gaining popularity within the state as well. With the addition of the Philadelphia Union in the MLS, the state now boasts three teams that are eligible to compete for the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup annually. The other two teams are Philadelphia Union II and the Pittsburgh Riverhounds. However, Penn FC (formally Harrisburg City Islanders) used to be one of these teams before they announced they'd be on hiatus in 2019; although they would be returning for the 2020 season.[185] Both of the United Soccer League (USL). Within the American Soccer Pyramid, the MLS takes the first tier, while the USL-2 claims the third tier. NASCAR racing at Pocono Raceway in Long Pond Arnold Palmer, one of the 20th century's most notable pro golfers, comes from Latrobe, while Jim Furyk, a current PGA member, grew up near in Lancaster. PGA tournaments in Pennsylvania include the 84 Lumber Classic, played at Nemacolin Woodlands Resort, in Farmington and the Northeast Pennsylvania Classic, played at Glenmaura National Golf Club, in Moosic. Philadelphia is home to LOVE Park, once a popular spot for skateboarding, and across from City Hall, host to ESPN's X Games in 2001 and 2002.[186] Racing[edit] In motorsports, the Mario Andretti dynasty of race drivers hails from Nazareth in the Lehigh Valley. Notable racetracks in Pennsylvania include the Jennerstown Speedway in Jennerstown, the Lake Erie Speedway in North East, the Mahoning Valley Speedway in Lehighton, the Motordrome Speedway (closed) in Smithton, the Mountain Speedway in St. Johns, the Nazareth Speedway in Nazareth (closed); the Lernerville Speedway in Sarver and the Pocono Raceway in Long Pond, which is home to two NASCAR Cup Series races and an IndyCar Series race. The state is also home to Maple Grove Raceway, near Reading, which hosts major National Hot Rod Association sanctioned drag racing events each year. There are also two motocross race tracks that host a round of the AMA Toyota Motocross Championships in Pennsylvania. High Point Raceway is located in Mt. Morris, Pennsylvania, and Steel City is located in Delmont, Pennsylvania. Horse racing courses in Pennsylvania consist of The Meadows near Pittsburgh, Pocono Downs in Wilkes-Barre, and Harrah's Philadelphia in Chester, which offer harness racing, and Penn National Race Course in Grantville, Parx Racing (formerly Philadelphia Park) in Bensalem, and Presque Isle Downs near Erie, which offer thoroughbred racing. Smarty Jones, the 2004 Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes winner, had Philadelphia Park as his home course. College sports[edit] College football is popular in Pennsylvania.[citation needed] There are three colleges in Pennsylvania that play at the highest level of collegiate football competition, the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision. Two play in Power Five conferences, the Penn State University Nittany Lions of the Big Ten Conference and the University of Pittsburgh Panthers of the Atlantic Coast Conference, while the Temple University Owls play in the American Athletic Conference. Penn State claims two national championships (1982 & 1986) as well as seven undefeated seasons (1887, 1912, 1968, 1969, 1973, 1986 and 1994). Penn State plays its home games in the second-largest stadium in the United States, Beaver Stadium, which seats 106,572, and is currently led by head coach James Franklin. The University of Pittsburgh Panthers claims nine national championships (1915, 1916, 1918, 1929, 1931, 1934, 1936, 1937 and 1976) and has played eight undefeated seasons (1904, 1910, 1915, 1916, 1917, 1920, 1937 and 1976).[187] Pitt plays its home games at Heinz Field, a facility it shares with the Pittsburgh Steelers, and is led by current head football coach Pat Narduzzi. Other Pennsylvania schools that have won national titles in football include Lafayette College (1896), Villanova University (FCS 2009), the University of Pennsylvania (1895, 1897, 1904 and 1908)[188] and Washington and Jefferson College (1921). College basketball is also popular in the state, especially in the Philadelphia area where five universities, collectively termed the Big Five, have a rich tradition in NCAA Division I basketball. National titles in college basketball have been won by La Salle University (1954), Temple University (1938), University of Pennsylvania (1920 and 1921), University of Pittsburgh (1928 and 1930), and Villanova University (1985, 2016, and 2018).[189][190] Food[edit] Further information: Category:Cuisine of Pennsylvania Hershey Chocolate Factory Author Sharon Hernes Silverman calls Pennsylvania the snack food capital of the world.[191] It leads all other states in the manufacture of pretzels and potato chips. The Sturgis Pretzel House introduced the pretzel to America, and companies like Anderson Bakery Company, Intercourse Pretzel Factory, and Snyder's of Hanover are leading manufacturers in the Commonwealth. Two of the three companies that define the U.S. potato chip industry are based in Pennsylvania: Utz Quality Foods, which started making chips in Hanover, Pennsylvania, in 1921 and Wise Foods, which started making chips in Berwick also in 1921. The third, Frito-Lay is part of PepsiCo, and is based in Plano, Texas. Other companies such as Herr's Snacks, Martin's Potato Chips, Snyder's of Berlin (not associated with Snyder's of Hanover) and Troyer Farms Potato Products are popular chip manufacturers. The U.S. chocolate industry is centered in Hershey, Pennsylvania, with Mars, Godiva, and Wilbur Chocolate Company nearby, and smaller manufacturers such as Asher's[192] in Souderton,[193] and Gertrude Hawk Chocolates of Dunmore. Other notable companies include Just Born in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, makers of Hot Tamales, Mike and Ikes, the Easter favorite marshmallow Peeps, and Boyer Brothers of Altoona, Pennsylvania, which is well known for its Mallo Cups. Auntie Anne's Pretzels began as a market-stand in Downingtown, Pennsylvania, and now has corporate headquarters in Lancaster City.[194] Traditional Pennsylvania Dutch foods include chicken potpie, ham potpie, schnitz un knepp (dried apples, ham, and dumplings), fasnachts (raised doughnuts), scrapple, pretzels, bologna, chow-chow, and Shoofly pie. Martin's Famous Pastry Shoppe, Inc., headquartered in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, specializes in potato bread, another traditional Pennsylvania Dutch food. D.G. Yuengling & Son, America's oldest brewery, has been brewing beer in Pottsville since 1829. Among the regional foods associated with Philadelphia are cheesesteaks, hoagie, soft pretzels, Italian water ice, Irish potato candy, scrapple, Tastykake, and strombolis. In Pittsburgh, tomato ketchup was improved by Henry John Heinz from 1876 to the early 20th century. Famous to a lesser extent than Heinz ketchup is the Pittsburgh's Primanti Brothers Restaurant sandwiches, pierogies, and city chicken. Outside of Scranton, in Old Forge there are dozens of Italian restaurants specializing in pizza made unique by thick, light crust and American cheese. Erie also has its share of unique foods, including Greek sauce and sponge candy. Sauerkraut along with pork and mashed potatoes is a common meal on New Year's Day in Pennsylvania. Nicknames[edit] Pennsylvania has been known as the Keystone State since 1802,[195] based in part upon its central location among the original Thirteen Colonies forming the United States, and also in part because of the number of important American documents signed in the state (such as the Declaration of Independence). It was also a keystone state economically, having both the industry common to the North (making such wares as Conestoga wagons and rifles)[196][197] and the agriculture common to the South (producing feed, fiber, food, and tobacco).[198] Another one of Pennsylvania's nicknames is the Quaker State; in colonial times, it was known officially as the Quaker Province,[199] in recognition of Quaker[200] William Penn's First Frame of Government[201] constitution for Pennsylvania that guaranteed liberty of conscience. He knew of the hostility[202] Quakers faced when they opposed religious ritual, taking oaths, violence, war and military service, and what they viewed as ostentatious frippery.[203] ""The Coal State"", ""The Oil State"", ""The Chocolate State"", and ""The Steel State"" were adopted when those were the state's greatest industries.[204] ""The State of Independence"" currently appears on many road signs entering the state.

The university has three other campuses: two in Pennsylvania (Harrisburg and Exton) and one in Wilmington, Delaware. Founded as The Bullock School for Boys in 1821, the school was established in Wilmington, Delaware. It became The Alsop School for Boys from 1846 to 1853, and then Hyatt's Select School for Boys from 1853 to 1859. Military instruction was introduced in 1858, and the school changed its name in 1859 to Delaware Military Academy. It moved to Pennsylvania in 1862 and became Chester County Military Academy. It was known as Pennsylvania Military College after 1892 and adopted the Widener name in 1972. About 3,300 undergraduates and 3,300 graduate students attend Widener in eight degree-granting schools. The university offers associate's, baccalaureate, master's, and doctoral degrees in areas ranging from traditional liberal arts to professional programs. It is classified among ""Doctoral/Professional Universities"" and a ""Community Engagement Institution"".

Bullock operated the school until 1846 when it was sold to Samuel Alsop and renamed the Alsop School for Boys. In 1853, the school was sold to Theodore Hyatt and renamed the Hyatt's Select School for Boys,[3] and again in 1859 to the Delaware Military Academy.[4] In 1862, the school moved to West Chester, Pennsylvania. By act of assembly on April 8, 1862, the Pennsylvania legislature incorporated the school as a university under the name of Chester County Military Academy.[5] In 1865, the school moved to Chester, Pennsylvania, and occupied the building which would become the Old Main building of the Crozer Theological Seminary. By 1868, the school outgrew the Crozer Old Main building and relocated to its current location.[6] From 1892 to 1966, the school was known as Pennsylvania Military College (PMC) and was under the direction of General Charles Hyatt. PMC was once one of the nation's senior military colleges. In 1869, Pennsylvania Military College was the first school to have a U.S. Army detail stationed at the school and to receive federal arms for training. In 1904, the school was recognized on the first list of distinguished institutions published by the U.S. War Department. In 1923, ""American March King"" John Philip Sousa wrote and dedicated ""The Dauntless Battalion"" march to PMC's President (Colonel Charles E. Hyatt), the faculty and the cadets of PMC. Sousa had been presented with an honorary doctor of music degree by the college in 1920, and he was impressed by the cadet cavalry horsemen.[3] In 1966, the school changed its name again to PMC Colleges, which incorporated Pennsylvania Military College as well as Penn Morton College, which had a non-military, co-educational curriculum. The school expanded the Chester campus from 25 acres to 90 acres.[7] Graduate programs were introduced in 1966,[8] and female students were first enrolled in 1967.[9] In 1972, the institution was renamed Widener College to honor the memory of Eleanor Elkins Widener, the maternal grandmother of Fitz Eugene Dixon Jr., a generous supporter of the organization over four decades and a member of the prominent Widener family of Philadelphia.[10] The Corps of Cadets disbanded, although an Army ROTC program was retained. The Widener University School of Law was acquired in 1975, which was split in 2015 to become two separate law schools: one on the Delaware campus and another in Harrisburg - Widener University Commonwealth Law School. In recognition of its comprehensive offerings, Widener College became Widener University in 1979. Today, Widener is a four-campus university offering more than 80 programs of study. Architecture[edit] The Manor House on the campus of Widener University built by Jonathan Edwards Woodbridge in 1888 The Manor House was designed and built by Jonathan Edwards Woodbridge in 1888 at 14th and Potter Street. It was a wedding gift to his wife, Louise Deshong, and was originally named ""The Louise"". It was modeled after the late 19th-century English country manor style and is unique for its hand-made brick construction. The house was given to the city of Chester as a home for young women. In 1976, Widener University purchased the home for use as a student residence.[11] It later became home to the Phi Sigma Sigma sorority.[12] The home is currently used by Widener University as a student dormitory.[13] The Old Main and Chemistry Building were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.[14] Timeline[edit] Throughout its long history, the university has undergone several name changes. The following table details the various names Widener has held over the years as well as any significant organizational changes that occurred during each period. 1821–1846 The Bullock School for Boys, founded by John Bullock in Wilmington, Delaware 1846–1853 The Alsop School for Boys 1853–1859 Hyatt's Select School for Boys 1858: military instruction introduced 1859–1862 Delaware Military Academy 1862–1892 Pennsylvania Military Academy 1862: relocated from Wilmington to West Chester, Pennsylvania 1868: relocated to present location in Chester, Pennsylvania 1892–1966 Pennsylvania Military College (also known as PMC) 1966–1972 PMC Colleges (for Pennsylvania Military College and Penn Morton College, the civilian component) 1966: offered nursing program with College of Nursing of Crozer Foundation; first women admitted; first graduate program introduced (engineering) 1970: School of Nursing starts 1972–1979 Widener College 1972: Corps of Cadets disbanded, academic programs organized into 4 schools: Arts & Sciences, Engineering, Nursing, and Management 1975: Acquired Delaware Law School 1976: Delaware Campus opens as part of merger with Brandywine Junior College 1979–present Widener University 1980: University College program (undergraduate evening school) starts 1981: School of Hotel and Restaurant Management opens (renamed School of Hospitality Management in 1996) 1989: Harrisburg Campus opens 1993: School of Human Service Professions begins 2004: Exton Campus opens 2006: Metropolitan Hall and the Wellness Center are added to the main facilities in Chester 2011: Founders Hall is built to house the School of Nursing and the Oskin Leadership Institute 2012: School of Education, Innovation & Continuing Studies created through the merger of the Center for Education and University College 2013: Freedom Hall opens; Informatics, communication studies, and computer information systems have state-of-the-art technology to work with 2015: The School of Hospitality Management and the School of Education, Innovation, and Continuing Studies merge to create the School of Education, Hospitality, and Continuing Studies. 2015: Widener University School of Law – which used to be one school, sitting on two university campuses becomes Widener University Delaware Law School in Wilmington and Widener University Commonwealth Law School in Harrisburg. Campuses[edit] Widener consists of four campuses, the Main Campus in Chester, Pennsylvania, plus campuses in Wilmington, Delaware, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and Exton, Pennsylvania. Founded in 1866 after the school moved to Chester, the 108-acre (0.44 km2) main campus consists of over 100 buildings and serves all undergraduate day students as well as Continuing Studies, Osher Lifelong Learning Institute (OLLI) students, and graduate students. Widener's graduate programs include business, education, engineering, nursing, social work, physical therapy, and clinical psychology. The School of Law, which opened in 1976 on the Delaware Campus, consists of 16 buildings across 40 acres (160,000 m2) and is 12 miles (19 km) from the Main Campus. It contains the School of Law as well as the Legal Education Institute. Some classes for Continuing Studies students and graduate business students are also held here. The 21-acre (85,000 m2) Harrisburg Campus, opening in 1989, contains the Widener University Commonwealth Law School and has graduate programs in nursing and social work held there. In July 2015, Widener School of Law, which used to be one school sitting on the Delaware and Harrisburg campuses, split to become Delaware Law School in Wilmington and Widener University Commonwealth Law School in Harrisburg. Starting in 2004, the Exton Campus was added to Widener's growing institution. It is located in a business park 25 miles (40 km) from the Main Campus. It primarily serves Continuing Studies students and contains Widener's Osher Lifelong Learning Institute (OLLI), which provides continuing education programs for retired adults. Academics[edit] Widener's academic offerings include over 50 undergraduate majors, 40 minors, and more than 30 graduate programs of study. Widener has an undergraduate student to faculty ratio of 12:1 with 90% of the full-time faculty having doctorates or the highest degree in their field.[2] In addition, 60% of all classes contain less than 20 students.[15] Libraries and museums[edit] Alfred O. Deshong Memorial Child Feeding her Pets (1872) painting by Gaetano Chierici from the Widener University Alfred O. Deshong Collection The Wolfgram Memorial Library contains 242,000 volumes, 175,000 microfilms, 12,000 audio-visual materials and 1,960 serial subscriptions.[4] In 1979, Widener University leased and restored the Deshong Art Museum located on Edgemont Avenue in Chester. The Deshong Art Museum was built in 1914 after the death of the art collector and wealthy industrialist Alfred O. Deshong left his trust and land to the city of Chester.[16] Deshong donated over 300 pieces of art to the museum including carved Japanese ivory figures, Chinese carved hard stone vessels and 19th century American and European paintings.[16] Over the years, the museum fell into disrepair and in July 1984 the trustees that managed the art museum dissolved the trust. The Asian and impressionistic art collection were given to Widener University and are displayed in their permanent collection.[17][18] The PMC Museum highlights the legacy of the Pennsylvania Military Academy of Cadets with exhibits of sabres, uniforms, scrapbooks, newspapers and yearbooks.[19] Rankings and classifications[edit] In 2013, Widener was named a finalist for the President's Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll Presidential award - one of only 14 institutions in the nation to receive that honor. The university has made the honor roll every year since its inception in 2006. The 2018 Best Colleges list from U.S. News and World Report ranked Widener as tied for 192nd among 311 national universities, with a score of 32 out of 100.[20] It also ranks Widener's undergraduate engineering program 103rd among all 200 programs whose highest engineering degree is a bachelor's or master's.[21] Out of the 262 national universities ranked, Widener is 55th in the category ""Highest Proportion of Classes Under 20 Students"".[15] The U.S. News and World Report's 2008 Best Graduate Schools ranks several of Widener's graduate programs: clinical psychology → #145,[22] health care management → #49,[23] nursing → #141,[24] physical therapy → #173,[25] and social work → #140.[26] Athletics[edit] Widener has 22 varsity teams (11 for men and 11 for women) participating in Division III within the MAC Commonwealth of the Middle Atlantic Conferences (MAC). Formerly known as the Pioneers, their nickname changed to the Pride in the Fall of 2006 after a student poll.[27] Widener sports teams include: Men's and Women's varsity: basketball, cross country, lacrosse, soccer, swimming, indoor track and field, outdoor track and field, volleyball and golf. Men's varsity: baseball and football Women's varsity: field hockey and softball Co-ed Varsity: esports[28] Club sports: men's ice hockey, men's rugby union, women's rugby, and cheerleading Athletic achievements[edit] The football team has had recent success winning the MAC championship in 2012 and an ""Elite 8"" appearance in the Division III Playoffs, the ECAC Southwest Bowl in 2011,[29] and the ECAC South Atlantic Bowl in 2005.[30] Its greatest success has been winning the NCAA Division III National Championship in 1977 and 1981 under long-time coach Bill Manlove and reaching the semi-finals in 1979, 1980, and 2000. Widener also reached the quarterfinals of the tournament in 2012 before losing to eventual NCAA D-III National Champion, Mount Union, by a lopsided 72–17 score.[31] In 2014, the team again won the MAC championship and eventually lost in the NCAA Division III tournament in the ""Elite Eight"" to Linfield by a score of 45–7.[32] Additionally, Widener football has won 17 MAC championships, the most of any team in the conference. Billy ""White Shoes"" Johnson played for Widener in the early 70s. He went on to be an all-pro NFL player and was selected to the NFL 75th Anniversary All-Time Team as well as the College Football Hall of Fame. The men's basketball team has won 15 MAC titles and appeared in the NCAA Division III Tournament 17 times, advancing to the ""Sweet 16"" in 1987 and 2006, the ""Final 4"" in 1985, and the championship game in 1978.[31] The men's lacrosse team has appeared in the NCAA Tournament 8 times since 2000 and has won 12 MAC titles since 1996.[31] The men's swimming team has won 12 MAC titles since 1994.[31] Athletic facilities[edit] The Schwartz Athletic Center is home to basketball, swimming, indoor track, and volleyball. It houses a newly renovated 25-yard (23 m) by 25 meter 10-lane competition swimming pool, squash/racquetball courts, and administrative offices for the athletic department. Schwartz is also home to the new Wellness Center, opened in April 2006 to provide the faculty, staff, and students with additional recreational and fitness opportunities. In addition to exercise equipment, the Wellness Center provides fitness classes and a 24-foot (7.3 m) rock climbing wall. Opening in 1994, Leslie C.

The arena includes 26 top of the line gaming PCs and serves as both a practice and competition space for the athletes.[33] The Philadelphia Eagles held their summer training camp on Widener's campus between 1973 and 1979. The 2006 movie Invincible depicts the campus during the Eagles' 1976 summer training camp.[34] Since 2006, the Philadelphia Soul have held practices at Widener as well.

University Technology Park — A joint project started in 1999 between the university and Crozer-Keystone Health System to foster small business opportunities focusing on health care, science and technology. It currently consists of two buildings (with three more planned) on 20 acres (81,000 m2) and is located directly in between the Main Campus and Crozer-Keystone Medical Center. Widener University Observatory — The observatory has free public telescope viewings throughout the school year hosted by the physics and astronomy department. Charter school[edit] In 2006, the university established a new charter school near the Chester campus to serve local residents from kindergarten to grade 5. Named the Widener Partnership Charter School, the school utilizes the university's programs in education, social work, nursing, and clinical psychology. This collaboration involves the participation of Widener faculty and students to not only provide educational support but also provide additional assistance outside of school through counseling and health services. Classes in the charter school started in September 2006, enrolling 50 students in both kindergarten and grade 1. The school continued to add a new grade each year until grade 8 had been reached, surpassing the initial expectations of the project. Chester revitalization project[edit] A $50 million revitalization project was started in 2007. The project, named University Crossings, included the addition of a hotel, bookstore, coffee shop, restaurant, and apartments. The project is expected to have an overall economic impact of $1 million to Chester, as well as creating 100 new jobs.[40] In 2017, Widener University purchased the Taylor Memorial Arboretum in Nether Providence Township about 1 mile north of the Chester campus. The University purchased the site from BNY Mellon bank and plans to use the nature reserve for research and hands-on learning opportunities for citizen science projects.[41] Notable alumni[edit] As of 2011, there were 59,018 total living alumni.[2] Benjamin P.

A new study from WCS, the Nevada Department of Wildlife (NDOW), and the University of Nevada-Reno using DNA from hair and blood samples found that conservation efforts have resulted in successful re-colonization by black bears.“The recovery of large carnivores is relatively rare globally,"" said WCS Rocky Mountain West Wildlife Director and study co-author, Jon Beckmann. Both black bears and grizzly bears were found in the mountain ranges across most of Nevada, but by the 1930s both species were extirpated from the Great Basin Desert because of removals due to conflicts with livestock ranchers and habitat loss due to clear-cut logging. Black bears are coming back thanks to a reduction in logging and improved forestry practices over the last half-century, combined with conservation efforts by WCS and NDOW over the last 20+ years, including education, increased bear-proofing in communities stemming from WCS’s policy work, and improved human-wildlife co-existence.

Integrating Wildlife and Culture: A New Framework for ConservationDownload reportNestled just south of Glacier National Park in Montana, where the Great Plains first meets the dramatic uplift of the Rocky Mountains, is the Badger-Two Medicine (B2M) area. Encircled by the majestic Glacier National Park, the foothills and prairies of Blackfeet Indian Reservation, and the rugged Bob Marshall and Great Bear Wilderness Areas, the B2M occupies a strategic position in the international landscape known as the Crown of the Continent Ecosystem. The B2M is part of the traditional homeland of the Blackfeet Indians, who sold the area to the U.S. government in 1895-96 but reserved certain sovereign rights such as hunting and fishing. Now part of the Lewis and Clark National Forest, the Badger-Two Medicine is one of the last, best places for rare and vulnerable fish and wildlife species – including native cutthroat trout, grizzly bear, wolverine, and mountain goat. Over the past century, successive generations of citizens and government leaders have worked hard to save the core of this Crown of the Continent ecosystem by establishing world-class parks and wildernesses, coupled with conservation of critical wildlife habitat on state and private lands along the periphery. These collective achievements constitute a great gift, but one important piece remains missing in this remarkable legacy: the Badger-Two Medicine.Earlier political efforts in the 1980s and 1990s to safeguard the Badger-Two Medicine area through Wilderness designation by Congress did not succeed. But could there by a new and different path? Now is the time to complete the legacy by charting a new path for protection of the Badger-Two Medicine based upon new information, greater mutual understanding and leadership … a path of co-stewardship that integrates the wildlife and cultural values into a vision of vital land, sacred land. Help plan the future of the Flathead National ForestThere are an impressive 478,754 acres of inventoried roadless areas and many thousand acres with fading roads still remaining on the Flathead National Forest, Montana. These roadless areas present a large-scale opportunity to complete the legacy of conservation first started a century ago in this spectacular and treasured landscape. In 2014, the Wildlife Conservation Society reported that the Flathead National Forest is a nationally-important stronghold ... “one of the last, best places” ... for a range of iconic species that have vanquished or diminished across much of their historic range and ranks as one of the most important National Forests in the entire country for wildlife and wildlands.The Flathead National Forest has completed the first stages of its Forest Plan revision process, following many of the recommendations for Wilderness and Backcountry in this WCS report. In addition, WCS scientist John Weaver, author of the report, has developed a short commentary, providing rationale and maps for additional areas recommended for protection.   Help plan the Flathead’s future: read the proposed actions and provide comments here.    The deadline for public comments is May 15 Are wildlife conservation and suburban development at odds with one another? They don't have to be, according to WCS scientist and Colorado State University affiliate faculty member Dr. Sarah Reed. One solution is conservation developments, or subdivisions built with the natural environment in mind. ""[Conservation developments are] a way to achieve conservation in the context of development that is going to happen anyway,"" explains Dr. Reed. Conservation developments may preserve wildlife habitat, help maintain ecosystem services, and can act as corridors for wildlife movement between protected areas. At present, conservation developments account for about one quarter of all private land in the U. S. And these subdivisions make economic sense, too - a study published in 2013 by Dr. Reed and her colleagues found that homes in conservation developments sold for 25 to 29 percent higher than comparable homes in other subdivisions. This premium is an incentive for developers considering whether to build traditional or conservation developments.But how do we know that these developments are truly protecting wildlife? Another of Dr. Reed's studies, published in 2014, found that only 13 percent of conservation developments required the consultation of an ecologist. This is likely because ""...conservation biologists hadn't taken i upon themselves to help,"" according to Dr. Reed. One of Reed's current graduate students, Cooper Farr, is trying to determine which characteristics of design and management are most important for biodiversity conservation. Farr's early results indicate that continuous open space, native vegetation, and surrounding home densities all play a significant role in supporting songbird communities, as well as elk, mule deer, coyotes, and black bears. Trash and Human-Bear Encounters in Urban Areas The Reno Gazette-Journal recently highlighted research published in 2003 by WCS scientists Dr. Jon Beckmann and Dr. Joel Berger, who assessed black bear hibernation patterns in both urban and wildland areas near Lake Tahoe. Their results showed that bears living in urban and semi-urban areas - those that had year-round access to trash - changed their hibernating behavior in order to eat the trash. Urban bears entered their dens later and emerged earlier than wildland bears, and became more nocturnal in order to avoid people while trash-raiding. The authors even found some urban bears that never hibernated. South Reno, Nevada resident Troy Brown can confirm these results. After noticing that his garbage cans were being disturbed at night, Mr. Brown watched footage from a surveillance camera and discovered that the culprits were two black bears. Mr. Brown contacted Mr. Carl Lackey of the Nevada Department of Wildlife, who was able to capture and remove the bears on Christmas Day.   ""It's not surprising. It's something that's so reliable, so predictable,"" explained Dr. Beckmann. By providing bears with additional food sources, we are changing their fundamental behavior and contributing to rising human-bear conflict in suburban areas. The study results, and Mr. Brown's encounter with his nighttime visitors, emphasize the importance of being bear aware and securing trash to discourage bears from foraging. In addition to studying bear responses to human activity, WCS is working throughout the Northern Rockies, particularly in Montana and Idaho, to provide safety tips about living near bears and avoid these types of situations. A National Celebration of Bison On Saturday, November 1st, bison-friendly businesses, groups, and individuals around the country celebrated the third annual National Bison day. More than 19 events occurred in at least 15 states to commemorate the historical, economic, ecological, and cultural contributions of bison across the American landscape. The Vote Bison Coalition, comprised of the Inter-Tribal Buffalo Council, National Bison Association, Wildlife Conservation Society, and more than 50 other organizations, businesses and tribes, supports National Bison Day as a way to celebrate the bison as an American icon.   John Calvelli, WCS Executive Vice President of Public Affairs, said, “National Bison Day continues to grow every year as more and more Americans recognize and appreciate bison, which are as unique to our national heritage and identity as baseball, apple pie and the bald eagle. This National Bison Day, I encourage bison supporters across the country to get involved via social media or by visiting a bison herd in person at their local zoo or public herd.”   In addition to attending National Bison Day events, this year the coalition sponsored a social media promotion called Beards for Bison, where supporters were encouraged to snap a photo of themselves wearing a beard (real, or a fake one printed from beardsforbison.org) and post it to social media with the hashtag #beardsforbison.   Click here to learn more about WCS’s bison conservation program. To read about how you can support the Bison Legacy Act, visit the Vote Bison Coalition. New York Times Article Explores Role of Beaver in Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem WCS scientist and Northern Rockies program coordinator Jeff Burrell is quoted in a recent New York Times article exploring the importance of beavers in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem and the lengths to which conservationists are going to lure the animals back into their native range.   “People realize that if we don’t have a way to store water that’s not so expensive, we’re going to be up a creek, a dry creek,” Mr. Burrell explains. Beaver dams create new habitat for a host of other species by raising the water table alongside a stream, aiding the growth of trees and plants that stabilize the banks and preventing erosion. They also improve fish and wildlife habitat and promote new, rich soil. Most importantly, beaver dams retain water that would otherwise drain away.   Read more about beavers and find out what a “beaver deceiver” is by reading the article. From the New York Times: Our Highways' Toll on Wildlife In a recent New York Times op-ed, North America Program Director Amanda Hardy and Associate Conservationist Renee Seidler argue that road collisions with wildlife can and must be reduced by building wildlife over- and under-passes. Resulting in hundreds of human deaths and billions of dollars in damage each year, collisions between vehicles and wildlife are both dangerous and costly. These accidents occur most frequently in places where wildlife are attempting to cross major highways during their annual migration, and human awareness of wildlife only goes so far.But, the authors claim, the danger can be reduced. To learn about their suggestions for mitigating these accidents, read the New York Times article. Eleven Plains Tribes and First Nations Sign Historic Treaty on Bison Restoration On September 23, dignitaries from 11 U. S. Tribes and Canadian First Nations signed the “Northern Tribes Buffalo Treaty” to establish intertribal alliances for restoring the American buffalo on Tribal/First Nations Reserves or co-managed lands.The historic signing, the first of its kind in more than 150 years, brought together members of the Blackfeet Nation, Blood Tribe, Siksika Nationa, Piikani Nation, the Assiniboine and Gros Ventre Tribes of Fort Belknap Indian Reservation, the Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes of Fort Peck Indian Reservation, the Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Indian Reservation, and the Tsuu T’ina Nation. Collectively, these Tribes/First Nations own and manage approximately 6.3 million acres of grassland and prairie habitat throughout the United States and Canada.   Through their combined voice and a formal expression of political unity, the goal of the treaty is to achieve ecological restoration of the buffalo on their respective lands, and in doing so to re-affirm and strengthen ties that formed the basis for traditions thousands of years old. Along with agreeing to work together for bison restoration and grassland conservation on tribal lands, the treaty encourages youth education and cultural restoration among the tribes.   “This is an historic moment that we hope will translate into a conservation movement among Great Plains Tribes,” said Keith Aune, Bison Program Director for the Wildlife Conservation Society, Chair of the IUCN Bison Specialist Group, and American Bison Society Spokesperson.   To learn more about WCS's efforts to conserve the American buffalo, visit our Bison Species page. Read more about the treaty in our press release. Tackling an Uncertain Future with Climate Scenario Planning A new publication from the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) illustrates that one way to make pro-active decisions in conservation and natural–resource planning today is to consider various scenarios that may unfold tomorrow. Conservation professionals face many challenges due to changes in climate, land use, invasive species, biodiversity, and more. These changes interact in complex ways and can result in unknowns that complicate natural resource decision-making. To achieve desired conservation and land-use outcomes, tools are needed to cope with these uncertainties.Considering Multiple Futures: Scenario Planning to Address Uncertainty in Natural Resource Conservation, demonstrates that scenario planning is such a tool. The authors, Drs. Erika Rowland Climate Change Ecologist and Molly Cross Climate Change Adaptation Coordinator for the North America Program of WCS, with Holly Hartmann of University of Arizona, Tucson, illustrate that by providing managers with a look at how the future may unfold, and how to respond, scenario planning can inform decision-making in light of uncertainties to better manage risk and maintain flexibility.

Protect Our Boreal Birds The Adirondack Park is in the southern edge of the range for several species of boreal forest birds within eastern North America. The hauntsof these boreal specialists—cool, wet, sphagnum-draped bogs and swampy woods—are thought to be particularly vulnerable to climate change. A recent Viewpoint opinion editorial by Michale Glennon, the Adirondack Landscape Science Coordinator for WCS, overviews the importance of monitoring ecological systems to understand the health of habitats and the impacts of land use on wildlife conservation in our boreal forests. Read the full opinion article here. Learn more about WCS Adirondacks boreal birds conservation research here. Yellowstone Grizzly Bears Are on the Rebound and Outbound A recent opinion editorial by Jeff Burrell, WCS' Northern Rockies Program Coordinator, highlights conservation status of Yellowstone's Grizzly population. As the Greater Yellowstone grizzly bear population has increased, separation between grizzly bear island populations is shrinking and closing the population gap is within reach. ""The Greater Yellowstone grizzly bear delisting debate provides an opportunity to expand our vision for grizzly bear conservation. It is a chance to move beyond restoring separate island populations. Only by integrating and interconnecting protected areas, mixed-use public lands and (by voluntary actions) private lands can we achieve true grizzly bear conservation.""

WCS Applauds Department of the Interior’s 'Bison Report: Looking Forward' The Department of the Interior released a comprehensive report on bison conservation and management that reaffirms the commitment to collaborate with states, tribes and other partners to promote the restoration of ranging bison on appropriate landscapes. In response, WCS issued a statement of support from Keith Aune, WCS' Bison Program Coordinator, lead spokesperson of the American Bison Society, and Chair of the IUCN Bison Specialist Group for North America: “WCS, ABS, and the IUCN Bison Specialist Group applaud the bison conservation strategy outlined today by the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) in its Bison Report: Looking Forward that calls for restoration of bison to multijurisdictional landscapes. The proposal to restore and manage bison at scales where they can fulfill their ecological role as a keystone herbivore has positive implications for biodiversity, and in particular, for maintaining the ecosystem health of imperiled U.S. grasslands."" Read the full WCS statement of support, the DOI press release and other press on this topic. Integrating the Human Dimensions of Wildlife Conservation Science A new publication called ""Moving Beyond Science to Protect a Mammalian Migration Corridor,"" by Joel Berger of WCS and the University of Montana (Missoula) and Steve Cain of Grand Teton National Park (Grand Teton, Wyoming), shows that while science plays a critical role in informing conservation action, scientists must move beyond the realm of their expertise into less familiar areas like public relations, education, and even politics, to ultimately meet America's conservation goals. The paper highlights the  pronghorn migration case study that resulted in the federal designation of Wyoming's Path of the Pronghorn (POP) migration corridor. The mandated protection for the 93-mile route of the POP was established by advocating the scientific evidence of its necessity, as well as the ecological, historical, and cultural relevance of the migration path. The act of engaging the public ultimately lead to the success of the POP, as explained by Dr. Joel Berger in a recent press release: ""We chose this project as a case study to show that science alone cannot achieve real world outcomes and that conservation is the provenance of the people."" Learn more about the Path of the Pronghorn. Protecting and Connecting the Flathead National Forest A new report “Conservation Legacy on a Flagship Forest: Wildlife and Wild Lands on the Flathead National Forest, Montana,” from WCS Senior Scientist Dr. John Weaver, calls for completing the legacy of Wilderness lands on the Flathead National Forest in Montana. The report identifies important, secure habitats and landscape connections for five species—bull trout, westslope cutthroat trout, grizzly bears, wolverines, and mountain goats. These iconic species are vulnerable to loss of secure habitat from industrial land uses and/or climate change. Weaver found that the Flathead is a stronghold for these fish and wildlife species that have been vanquished in much of their range further south. His analysis shows that 90 percent of the Flathead has a “very high” or “high” conservation value for at least one of the five focal species.

Bison Gain Support from the Senate to be Declared the National Mammal In the 1800s, industrial-scale slaughter left fewer than 1,000 bison in the wild. In 1905,the American Bison Society (ABS) was established by WCS in response to the slaughter, to save the species from extinction. ABS activities included the relocation of bison from the wild to the Bronx Zoo in New York. Today, WCS is working to restore free-ranging plains and wood bison at multiple locations across their historical ranges to ensure a future for wild bison. A historical icon of the Great Plains, the American Bison 'takes a first step today toward becoming an official American symbol.' Learn more about the National Bison Legacy Act and vote in the polls in support of this iconic legislation: Senate to introduce bill to make bison the national mammal.

WCS Scientist Highlighted by American Association of University Women Heidi Kretser had to go all the way to Nepal to realize that her dream job was back home in New York. She was working at Nepal’s Chitwan National Park when she realized, “Here I was, thousands of miles away from where I grew up. I had this epiphany that I really just wanted to work in a nice place, not a large city, and work in a park … and thought that I can do that in the Adirondacks, living essentially in my hometown.” So she packed her bags, earned her master’s degree in environmental studies from Yale, and began work with the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York. At WCS, she started a career focused on the human dimensions of wildlife and conservation management. She currently holds the position of Livelihoods and Conservation Coordinator in WCS’ North American program.In a recent profile of WCS's North America Program's Livelihoods and Conservation Coordinator, Dr. Heidi Kretser, the American Association of University Women (AAUW) spotlights their past fellow and her current work. Read the article by AAUW here: ""Backwoods Adventurer, Endangered Cat Defender, Moose Expert"" WCS Contributes to Groundbreaking Guidance on Climate-Smart Conservation Climate-Smart Conservation: Putting Adaptation Principles into Practice looks at how climate change already is affecting the nation’s wildlife and habitats, and addresses how natural resource managers will need to prepare for and adapt to these unprecedented changes. Developed by a broad collaboration of experts from federal, state, and non-governmental institutions, the guide offers practical steps for crafting conservation actions to enhance the resilience of the natural ecosystems on which wildlife and people depend. As the scope and scale of climate impacts continue to reveal their impacts on our communities and natural resources, there is a growing recognition of the need to not only address the underlying cause of climate change, by reducing climate-disrupting carbon pollution, but also to prepare for and adjust to our new conditions, known as climate adaptation. Because there is no one-size-fits-all solution to adaptation, the guide emphasizes the need to be intentional and deliberate in linking conservation actions to climate impacts. WCS Scientists Dr. Molly Cross and Erika Rowland were among the experts that contributed to this collection of useful information for conservation practitioners working in a variety of systems across the country.

It is one of the largest zoos in the United States by area and is the largest metropolitan zoo in the United States by area,[5] comprising 265 acres (107 ha) of park lands and naturalistic habitats separated by the Bronx River. On average, the zoo has 2.15 million visitors each year as of 2009[update].[5] The zoo's original permanent buildings, known as Astor Court, were designed as a series of Beaux-Arts pavilions grouped around the large circular sea lion pool.[6] The Rainey Memorial Gates were designed by sculptor Paul Manship in 1934 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.[7] The zoo opened on November 8, 1899, featuring 843 animals in 22 exhibits. Its first director was William Temple Hornaday, who served as director for 30 years. From its inception the zoo has played a vital role in animal conservation. In 1905, the American Bison Society was created in an attempt to save the American bison from extinction, which had been depleted from tens-of-millions of animals to only a few hundred. 2 years later they were successfully reintroduced into the wild. In 2007, the zoo successfully reintroduced three Chinese alligators into the wild. The breeding was a milestone in the zoo's 10-year effort to reintroduce the species to the Yangtze River in China. Today, the Bronx Zoo is world-renowned for its large and diverse animal collection, and its award-winning exhibitions.[5] The zoo is part of an integrated system of four zoos and one aquarium managed by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), and it is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA).[8] Contents 1 History 1.1 Early years 1.2 Recent years 2 Exhibits and attractions 2.1 Free exhibits and attractions 2.1.1 Astor Court 2.1.2 African Plains 2.1.3 Baboon Reserve 2.1.4 Big Bears 2.1.5 Himalayan Highlands 2.1.6 Madagascar! 2.1.7 Mouse House 2.1.8 Aquatic Bird House 2.1.9 Russell B.

Hornaday feeding a greater kudu in 1920 In 1895, a group made up largely of members of the Boone and Crockett Club founded the New York Zoological Society (later renamed the Wildlife Conservation Society) for the purposes of founding a zoo, promoting the study of zoology, and preserving wildlife.[9] Credit for this belonged chiefly to Club members Madison Grant and C. Grant LaFarge.[10] The zoo (sometimes called the Bronx Zoological Park[11] and the Bronx Zoological Gardens[12]) opened its doors to the public on November 8, 1899, featuring 843 animals in 22 exhibits. Its first director was William Temple Hornaday, who had 30 years of service at the zoo.[13] Heins & LaFarge designed the original permanent buildings, known as Astor Court, as a series of Beaux-Arts pavilions grouped around the large circular sea lion pool.[6] In 1934, the Rainey Memorial Gates, designed by sculptor Paul Manship, were dedicated as a memorial to noted big game hunter Paul James Rainey.[14] The gates were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.[7] The Rockefeller Fountain, which today adorns the gardens just inside the Fordham Road Gate, was once a landmark in Como, Italy. Originally built by Biagio Catella in 1872, it stood in the main square (Piazza Cavour) by the lakeside.[15] Bought by William Rockefeller in 1902 for 3,500 lire (the estimated equivalent then of $637, and today of around $17,600), it was installed at the zoo in 1903. In 1968, the fountain was designated an official New York City landmark, and is one of the few local monuments to be honored in this way.[16] The New York Zoological Society's seal was designed by famed wildlife-artist Charles R. Knight. It depicted a ram's head and an eagle to reflect the society's interest in preserving North American wildlife.[17] While no longer in use, the seal can still be found on the lawn in the center of Astor Court. On December 17, 1902, the zoo became one of the seven zoos outside of Australia, and one of only two in the United States, to ever hold the now-extinct thylacine. The first was a male obtained from German animal dealer Carl Hagenbeck. It died on August 15, 1908. The zoo received a second male on January 26, 1912, from the Beaumaris Zoo in Tasmania, who later died on November 20 of that year. The zoo received its final two animals from Sydney animal dealer Ellis S. Joseph. The first was an unsexed individual who arrived on November 7, 1916, in poor condition and died seven days later. The second and final animal was a female purchased from the Beaumaris Zoo by Joseph for £25 (~$35) and then was resold to the zoo, arriving on July 14, 1917.[18] On a visit, the director of the Melbourne Zoo, Mr. Le Souef, said upon seeing the animal: I advise you to take excellent care of that specimen; for when it is gone, you never will get another. The species soon will be extinct. The thylacine died on September 13, 1919.[18] In early 1903, the zoo was gifted a pair of Barbary lions, a subspecies which is extinct in the wild. The female was named Bedouin Maid and male Sultan, who went on to become one of the zoo's most popular animals. Displayed in the Lion House, Sultan was four years old at the time and described as being both ""a perfect specimen"" and ""unusually good tempered"". In May 1903, the pair produced three cubs, the first to be born at the zoo. On October 7, 1905, Charles R. Knight painted a portrait of Sultan and the animal went on to be the focus of many of the zoo's postcards. Sultan was also the model for the lion which sits atop the Rainey Memorial Gates.[19] In 1916, the zoo built the world's first animal hospital located at a zoo.[5] In 1926, the Bronx and the Smithsonian National Zoo simultaneously became the first in the country to exhibit shoebills.[20] The same year, W. Douglas Burden, F. J. Defosse, and Emmett Reid Dunn collected two live adult Komodo dragons—the first in America—for the zoo.[21] In 1937, the zoo became the first in North America to exhibit okapi.[22] Recent years[edit] Historical Fordham Road Entrance to the Bronx Zoo featuring Rainey Memorial Gates In 1960, the zoo became the first in the world to keep a James's flamingo, a species which had been thought to be extinct until 1957. They were imported along with the similar Andean flamingo.[23] The zoo was one of the few in the world to exhibit proboscis monkeys outside of Southeast Asia and, in the 1976 International Zoo Yearbook, the zoo reported having eight monkeys, seven of which were born at the zoo. As of March 1999, it only had two monkeys left, these two being the last members of their species kept in the United States.[24][25] In 2003, the pair were sent to the Singapore Zoo. On June 6, 1990, the zoo received a female Sumatran rhinoceros named Rapunzel. At the time, the zoo was one of only three in North America to hold the critically endangered species, with the Cincinnati and San Diego Zoos being the others, holding one female each. The three institutions were a part of the Sumatran Rhino Trust's plan to start a captive breeding program for the species.[26] Rapunzel was born in the wild in Sumatra and rescued from an area of rainforest that was slated to be cleared for a palm oil plantation in 1989. Though it's believed she bred in the wild, she never produced any calves in captivity. It was eventually determined that she was past reproductive age, at which point she was returned to the zoo in 2000, having been brought out for breeding purposes. She lived in the Zoo Center until her death in December 2005 in her 30s.[27] In November 2006, the zoo opened up brand-new eco-friendly restrooms outside the Bronx River Gate. According to Clivus Multrum, which built the composting toilets chosen by the zoo, these facilities can serve 500,000 people and save 1,000,000 U.S. gallons (3,800,000 l) of water a year.[28][29] In March 2007, the Wildlife Conservation Society and the Fordham University Graduate School of Education announced they would offer a joint program leading to a Master of Science degree in education and New York State initial teacher certification in adolescent science education (biology, grades 7–12). The program began the next year, and is the first joint degree program of its kind.[30] In 2009, New York City[who?] cut funding for the state's 76 zoos, aquariums, and botanical gardens. The Wildlife Conservation Society as a whole suffered a $15-million deficit, and the zoo was forced to downsize its staff and animal collection. The budget cuts forced the buyouts of over 100 employees and layoffs of dozens more as well as the closure of four sections of the zoo: World of Darkness, Rare Animal Range, the Skyfari, and a small section of the overall still-open African Plains exhibit which featured endangered antelope.[31][32] In the end, 186 staff positions (15%) were cut within the WCS. In 2012, Mayor Michael Bloomberg passed another budget cut that took $4.7-million from the funding of the zoo and the New York Aquarium, also run by the WCS. This cut represented more than half of what the collections were receiving. However, Bloomberg also passed an energy subsidy that brought the cuts down to $3.7-million.[33] In the summer of 2014, New York Representative Carolyn B. Maloney visited the Chengdu Panda Base in Sichuan, China and announced her plan to bring giant pandas to New York City. Initially, she aimed to exhibit them at the Central Park Zoo, though switched her attention to the Bronx after deciding the 6.5-acre zoo didn't have the resources to care for the animals. Maloney and her supporters, which included Maurice R. Greenberg, Newt Gingrich, and John A. Catsimatidis, were met with many obstacles throughout their campaign. Initially, the largest issues were the lack of support from Mayor Bill de Blasio and City Hall, and Chinese officials insisting that no more pandas be brought to the United States. However, in October 2015, Chinese Ambassador Cui Tiankai announced that his country was willing to enter preliminary talks with the city over the matter, and soon after de Blasio and City Hall signed a letter appealing to Chinese officials, drafted by Maloney in 2014. Despite her efforts, Maloney's campaign still has yet to overcome two critical steps in acquiring pandas: funding and the zoo's consent. Both de Blasio and the Wildlife Conservation Society refuse to fund the project, not wanting taxpayer or vital zoo money to go towards the highly expensive project. David Towne, chairman of the American-based Giant Panda Conservation Foundation, estimated that the cost of bringing pandas to the city would be around $50 million. The foundation has also said that the cost of keeping just one such animal is about $1 million a year, including food, trainers, and habitat upkeep. Additionally, China loans out their pandas for a hefty fee. A study published by The Washington Post in 2005 found that the four U.S. zoos holding pandas (the Memphis Zoo, the San Diego Zoo, the Smithsonian National Zoological Park, and Zoo Atlanta) had spent $33 million more on their animals than revenue made off of them between 2000 and 2003. Despite the figures, Maloney believes pandas in her city will do better since the city has a higher population than those four cities combined, and received a record-breaking 56.4-million visitors in 2014. Still, the WCS continues to steer away from bringing in these pandas. In 2014, a senior official from the WCS said Maloney's campaign had reached ""a new level of absurdity"" when it was announced she intended to bring a Chinese delegation to the Central Park Zoo. In November 2015, Jim Breheny, WCS Executive Vice President and Bronx Zoo Director, released a statement saying:[34][35] The concept of bringing Giant Pandas to New York which the Congresswoman is proposing is complex and would require that a number of complicated issues be considered and resolved before any such plan could be implemented. Any decision to bring giant pandas to New York would need to be based on positively contributing to the conservation of giant pandas in the wild and a determination that all the requirements necessary to keep the animals well in New York could be met. Very importantly, there is no funding for this initiative. Building and maintenance of such a exhibit would be an ongoing effort that would require tens of millions of dollars up front and annual support monies for pandas for however long they would be in the city. Any agreement to exhibit pandas would have to come with a guarantee of provision for the necessary funds. Exhibits and attractions[edit] This section needs additional citations for verification.

(April 2018) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The zoo has two types of displays: free exhibits accessible with a General Admission ticket, and premium exhibits which require additional fees.[36][37] Free exhibits and attractions[edit] A Gelada in Baboon Reserve. A Guanay cormorant in the Sea Bird Aviary: The zoo is the last to hold the species outside of South America. African Plains American Bison Aquatic Bird House and Sea Bird Aviary Baboon Reserve Big Bears Birds of Prey Bison Range Bug Carousel Carter Giraffe Building Congo Gorilla Forest (during winter) Himalayan Highlands JungleWorld Madagascar! Mitsubishi Riverwalk Mouse House Nature Trek Northern Ponds Pheasant Aviary Sea Lion Pool Tiger Mountain World of Birds World of Reptiles Zoo Center As of 2010[update], the Bronx Zoo is home to more than 4,000 animals of 650 species, many of which are endangered or threatened.[3] Some of its exhibits, such as World of Birds and World of Reptiles, are arranged by taxonomy, while others, such as African Plains and the Wild Asian Monorail, are arranged geographically.[38] Astor Court[edit] Astor Court is an old section of the zoo that is home to many of the zoo's original buildings, designed by Heins & LaFarge. While most of the buildings are closed to the public, the former Lion House was reopened as the ""Madagascar!"" exhibit in 2008,[39] and the Zoo Center still exhibits various species. The highlight of the area is the historic sea lion pool, featuring California sea lions. Small aviaries featuring small bird species can be found nearby and white-headed capuchins can be seen behind the old Monkey House. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated Astor Court's buildings as a city landmark in 2000,[40] after a failed attempt to do so in 1966.[41] African Plains[edit] African Plains allows visitors to walk past lions, African wild dogs, and Grévy's zebras, and see herds of Thomson's gazelles, lowland nyalas, and slender-horned gazelles sharing their home with lesser kudus, marabou storks, grey crowned cranes, blue cranes, and red-flanked duikers. Hybrid giraffes (Baringo × reticulated giraffe) roam nearby. The exhibit originally opened in 1941 and was the first in the country to allow visitors to view predators and their prey in a naturalistic setting as well as allowing large predators such as lions to be exhibited cage-free.[5] This success was achieved through the creation of a series of deep moats, a set-up which can still be found at the zoo today.[15] The wild dogs, however, can be viewed close-up from a glass-fronted viewing pavilion.[42] The zoo has bred their lions on multiple occasions, including one male and two females born in January 2010 and three males and one female born in August 2013. The zoo, in partnership with the NY Daily News, held a contest to name the 2010 cubs, which made their public debut in April 2010. The winning names were Shani, Nala, and Adamma.[43] The 2013 cubs were named Thulani, Ime, Bahata, and Amara[44] and the three males can still be found on-exhibit at the zoo. The Carter Giraffe Building, a section of African Plains, features indoor/outdoor viewing of the zoo's giraffes and southern ostriches (Struthio camelus australis), and is also home to spotted hyenas, common dwarf mongoose, and southern white-faced owls. In June 2009, two aardvarks imported from Tanzania joined the exhibit.[5][45] In September 2010, the pair gave birth to a male named Hoover, the first to ever be born at the zoo. In 1924, the zoo became the first in North America to exhibit the species.[46] Until 2009, the southwestern corner of African Plains was home to the endangered Arabian oryx and blesbok. Due to budget cuts and the unpopularity of the species with visitors, they were phased-out of the collection.[32] This section of the exhibit remains empty. In 2017 they received two baby cheetahs from the San Diego Zoo. Cheetahs are now part of their animal encounter programs.[47] They were replaced by the hyenas.[48] Baboon Reserve[edit] Baboon Reserve, opened in 1990, is a two-acre recreation of the Ethiopian highlands which, at the time of its opening, was the largest primate exhibit in the United States.[49] The exhibit's main features revolve around the zoo's troop of geladas such as artificial rocks and earthbanks, and displays about life in the highlands and the side-by-side evolution of humans and geladas. Visitors can watch the geladas from multiple viewpoints along with Nubian ibex and rock hyrax, all of which are mixed together in the hilly enclosure. An African village-styled café overlooks the exhibit. Baboon Reserve won the AZA Exhibit Award in 1991.[49][50] In the fall of 2014, a male gelada was born at the zoo, the first in over 13 years.[51][52] Blue-winged geese and Cape teals have been exhibited here as well, though are currently absent. The former can now be found in African Plains while the later appears to be absent from the zoo's current on-exhibit collection.[49] Big Bears[edit] Big Bears features both a brown bear exhibit and a relatively new dhole exhibit. They have four bears, a male grizzly bear and three ABC Islands bears (Ursus arctos sitkensis) rescued as orphans from the ABC Islands of Alaska.[53] Until 2015, two female grizzly bears named Betty and Veronica also lived in this exhibit, but are now on-exhibit at the Central Park Zoo.[54] Until his death in 2017, a male polar bear named Tundra also lived in Big Bears.[55] He was replaced by the dholes in 2019. Himalayan Highlands[edit] Himalayan Highlands, which opened on June 27, 1986,[56] recreates the Himalayas region of Asia. The exhibit is known for its highly naturalistic look and use of the hilly and rocky terrain found in that portion of the zoo. The stars of the exhibit are the zoo's multiple snow leopards. The exhibit also is home to western red pandas, white-naped cranes, and Temminck's tragopans. In 2006, the zoo brought in a male snow leopard named Leo from Pakistan after he was orphaned at around two months old.[57] Leo sired a male cub on April 9, 2013. The cub is one of more than 70 snow leopards born at the zoo, which was the first U.S. zoo to exhibit the species in 1903. Leo later became a grandfather when his son sired a female cub in 2017.[58] Madagascar![edit] Madagascar!, which opened on June 20, 2008, recreates various habitats found on the island of Madagascar and contains a variety of wildlife from the island, including lemurs, lesser hedgehog tenrecs, fossas, Nile crocodiles, radiated tortoises, and highly endangered cichlids, as well as a variety of smaller species.[39][59] Ring-tailed lemurs, collared lemurs, red ruffed lemurs, crowned lemurs, and Coquerel's sifakas are the lemur species held in the exhibit. Madagascar! holds the only two ring-tailed vontsiras in the United States and is home to over 100,000 Madagascar hissing cockroaches that can be named for $10 around Valentine's Day.[5][60] The exhibit has multiple educational displays focusing on the many threats to the survival of these species as well as the WCS's conservation work in Madagascar. The building was converted from the former Lion House, which had opened in 1903 and closed by the late 1980s. The exhibit also has tomato frogs. Mouse House[edit] The Mouse House is a small building home to various species of small mammals, particularly rodents. The building features both diurnal and nocturnal areas and a row of outdoor cages which, during the summer months, are home to a variety of small primates, many of which are former monkey house inhabitants. Species include Karoo short-eared elephant shrew, northern Luzon giant cloud rat, western spotted skunk, golden-headed lion tamarin, Mohol bushbaby, Damaraland mole-rat, lesser Egyptian jerboa, long-tailed chinchilla, Harris's antelope squirrel, California mouse, green acouchi, and woodland dormouse. Aquatic Bird House[edit] The current Aquatic Bird House opened on September 24, 1964, on the foundation of the original house, which was opened on November 8, 1899, with the rest of the zoo. The building features a multitude of mostly open-fronted enclosures mainly focusing on coastal and wetland habitats and the species that rely on them.[61] Scarlet ibises, roseate spoonbills, a Madagascar crested ibis, giant wood rail, pied avocets, Baer's pochards, common terns, African spoonbills, silver teals and Forster's terns are among the residents here. The exhibit also features an outdoor pond home to a flock of American flamingos and Orinoco geese, and a large aviary home to greater and lesser adjutant storks. The zoo is one of only three zoos in North America working with the endangered storks and has bred them several times, including the hatching of two chicks on June 27 and August 15, 2015.[62] The Aquatic Bird House is also home to another endangered stork species: the Storm's stork. The zoo is one of only two in the United States working with this species; the other being the San Diego Zoo. In May 2014, the zoo opened a new nocturnal enclosure for a North Island brown kiwi in the building,[63] and in May 2015, a colony of Australian little blue penguins from the Taronga Zoo were added.[64] Russell B. Aitken Sea Bird Aviary[edit] The Russell B. Aitken Sea Bird Aviary, which opened on May 17, 1997, is a huge walk-through aviary designed to resemble the Patagonian coast. The aviary stands at 60-feet high, occupies 615,000 cubic feet, is supported by five steel arches, and netted with a stainless steel mesh. The aviary was built to replace the original De Jur Aviary that opened with the zoo in 1899 and collapsed in a snowstorm in February 1995.[65] The exhibit's height and open space allows the residents to soar around above visitor's heads and the fake sea cliff walls allows for more natural nesting and roosting behavior. The aviary is home to about 100 birds, most being Inca terns, but also a small colony of Magellanic penguins, flying steamer ducks, and a black-faced ibis. The aviary is also home to the last Guanay cormorant in captivity outside of South America. In April 2014, four Peruvian pelicans were added to the exhibit,[66] and in January 2015, a pair of ruddy-headed geese were added.[67] Tiger Mountain[edit] Tiger Mountain, which opened on May 15, 2003, is a three-acre exhibit which features Amur tigers and occasionally Malayan tigers, who are usually kept off-exhibit. The exhibit has two enclosures with glass viewing, the second of which has a 10,000 gallon pool with underwater viewing. Outside of the tigers, the exhibit has multiple interactive displays designed to educate visitors on behavioral enrichment and on the zoo's/WCS' ex-situ and in-situ conservation. The exhibit won the AZA Exhibit Award in 2004.[68] The zoo has had good breeding successful with both subspecies of tiger, having bred both in 2010.[69] Another set of Siberian tiger cubs were born in 2012,[70] and a pair of Malayan tiger cubs were born in 2016.[71] A tiger called Nadia tested positive for COVID-19 during the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City.[72] Across from the entrance to Tiger Mountain, a large herd of Père David's deer and a pair of whooper swans can be found. Prior to Tiger Mountain's construction, this area was home to Mexican wolves and hooded cranes.[73] World of Birds[edit] Maleo World of Birds, which originally opened in 1972, is an indoor bird house spanning two floors and featuring several walk-through aviaries. The building closed for repairs and upgrades in the summer of 2010,[74] and reopened the following year. The exhibit has multiple educational displays focusing on deforestation and the illegal wildlife trade and their affects on wild bird populations. The most prominent residents of the exhibit include the maleos,[75] a pair of Sanford's tarictic hornbills (Penelopides exarhatus sanfordi), green junglefowl, fawn-breasted bowerbirds, Cuban amazons, pink pigeons, Andean cocks-of-the-rock, plate-billed mountain toucans, Oriental pied hornbills, Abdim's storks, keas, three species of birds-of-paradise, hoatzins, golden-headed quetzals, resplendent quetzals, long-wattled umbrellabirds, greater coucals, red-crowned cranes, blue-billed curassows, white-throated bee-eaters, western capercaillies, white-fronted bee-eaters and common hoopoes. Emus can be found in an outdoor yard. Golden lion tamarins, Bolivian grey titis, cotton-top tamarins, and red-footed tortoise make up the exhibit's non-bird species. In mid-2009, the zoo's hand-reared pair of great blue turacos successfully raised chicks, the first known instance of a hand-reared pair doing so.[76] In March 2013, three maleo chicks hatched at the zoo, bringing their total number of birds to 12. The zoo, along with the WCS, works toward preserving this species in the wild as well.[75] World of Reptiles[edit] World of Reptiles has been an attraction at the zoo since it first opened. The building's first curator was Raymond Lee Ditmars, who had kept 45 snakes in his attic before being hired at the zoo.[77] The exhibit is a long hall with various terrariums situated on both sides. The exhibit also features a nursery area, which exhibits newborn herptiles born at the zoo, as well as a window into the off-show breeding and caring facilities. In the building, the zoo breeds and exhibits a wide range of endangered species, including Cuban crocodile, false gharial, Chinese alligator, yellow-headed day gecko, blue iguana, Mary River turtle, Fly River turtle, golden coin turtle, yellow-headed box turtle, Volcán Darwin giant tortoise (Chelonoidis nigra microphyes), Egyptian tortoise, pancake tortoise, Panamanian golden frog, and golden poison dart frog. The building also is home to the zoo's breeding population of Kihansi spray toads, which the zoo saved from extinction.[78] Other species held include lace monitor, northern caiman lizard, Taylor's cantil, green anaconda, king cobra, reticulated python, Burmese python, Gila monster, Solomon Islands skink, Gaboon viper, eyelash palm pitviper, giant snake-necked turtle, Chiapas giant musk turtle, marine toad and Solomon Island leaf frog. On March 25, 2011, an Egyptian cobra escaped from its off-show enclosure, during which time the exhibit was closed to the public. Six days later, the animal was found elsewhere in the building. The zoo named the cobra MIA (Missing In Action) and placed it on exhibit.[79] Pheasant Aviary[edit] The Pheasant Aviary is a long row of cages home to a large variety of bird species, particularly pheasants. Exhibited species include Elliot's pheasant, Lady Amherst's pheasant, Cabot's tragopan, blue eared-pheasant, mountain peacock-pheasant, Mérida helmeted curassow (Pauxi pauxi pauxi), Swinhoe's pheasant, Java peafowl, Indian peafowl, eastern loggerhead shrike (Lanius ludovicianus migrans), white-throated ground-dove, Lord Derby's parakeet, Montezuma oropendola, and yellow-crested cockatoo. Across from the exhibit is a large pond for Chilean flamingos and coscoroba swans. Birds of Prey[edit] Birds of Prey is a row of cages for multiple raptor species. The exhibit is home to bald eagles, Rüppell's griffon vultures, lappet-faced vultures, burrowing owls, snowy owls, European eagle-owls, a barred owl, an Andean condor, cinereous vultures, and king vultures. In February 2011, the zoo received two bald eagles rescued in Wyoming.[80] Nearby is a small pond for black-necked swans, American white pelicans, and brown pelicans. Zoo Center[edit] The Zoo Center The Zoo Center, built in 1908, is a one-story Beaux-Arts building located in Astor Court. The exhibit houses blue tree monitors, Mertens' water monitors, and western spiny-tailed monitors (Varanus acanthurus brachyurus) indoors, and has both indoor and outdoor enclosures for Komodo dragons, Aldabra giant tortoises, and southern white rhinoceros.[81] The building's animal frieze was carved by A.P. Proctor.[5] In 2000, the building was landmarked.[82] The building is east of the Children's Zoo and south of Madagascar!.[83] The building was originally designed as the zoo's Elephant House and has held all three elephant species over its history.[84] The building has also been home to various rhinoceros species, hippopotamus, domestic Bactrian camel, Malayan tapir, and North Sulawesi babirusa. The building also held Rapunzel, one of the few Sumatran rhinos held in U.S. zoos, until her death in 2005.[85] Bison Range[edit] The Bison Range is in the northeast corner of the zoo,[86] and has been a feature of the zoo since its opening. The range initially served to breed Plains bison, who were in danger of becoming extinct in the United States. Today, the exhibit continues to hold one of the few large herds of bison in U.S. zoos. In 1913, at the behest of the American Bison Society, fourteen bison were transported from the range to Montana's National Bison Range, as well as to Wind Cave National Park in South Dakota.[87] Northern Ponds[edit] Northern Ponds is a series of naturalistic ponds home to a variety of waterfowl and other aquatic birds both wild and captive. Captive residents include black-necked cranes, red-breasted geese, lesser white-fronted geese, American ruddy duck, barnacle geese, mute swans, and trumpeter swan. A wide variety of wild bird species can also be found in the ponds, including several native ducks such as mallards and mergansers, as well as other birds such as black-capped night-herons. Mitsubishi Riverwalk[edit] The Mitsubishi Riverwalk is a path that curves around the Bronx River, on the opposite bank from the zoo. It opened in 2004 upon the completion of a cleanup project on the river. The walkway was funded by Mitsubishi International Corporation Foundation[88] and protects 15 acres (6.1 ha) of Bronx River watershed.[89] Paid exhibits and attractions[edit] One admission to a premium exhibit costs between $12 to 14 per person per exhibit if paid separately. The fee for unlimited admission grants the ticket holder free access to all attractions for that day. Family memberships include full access.[90] There are nine premium exhibit attractions: Bug Carousel Butterfly Garden Children's Zoo Congo Gorilla Forest JungleWorld Wild Asia Monorail Zoo Shuttle Nature Trek Camel rides (seasonal and weather permitting) and the Treetop Adventure Climb and Zipline and require a different fee and are not part of the admission fee online.[90] Thus, they are not included in the park ticket or in any membership. Bug Carousel[edit] The Bug Carousel has seats shaped like insects. Installed in 2005, it has an annual ridership of 540,000 as of 2014.[91] Butterfly Garden[edit] This permanent structure is an indoor butterfly conservatory which lets visitors walk through gardens and meadows and watch the butterflies up close. [92] Built and inaugurated in mid-1996, the attraction is a 170-foot-long maze, where ""visitors can walk through the stages of a monarch's metamorphosis"" with a greenhouse in the middle hosting 44 species and over 1,000 butterflies; the greenhouse is really ""a plastic tent on an aluminum frame."" The structure, costing $500,000, is the precursor for a future permanent House of Invertebrates in the Monkey House near the Fordham Road entrance. Many species come from the New York metropolitan area, and all species of butterflies and moths are from around the continent. If not successful, the Oklahoma City Zoo would have purchased it in September 1997.[93] Children's Zoo[edit] The original Children's Zoo in the Bronx Zoo opened in 1941 with a nursery-rhyme theme; in 1981, a new Children's Zoo opened, and was instantly successful, seeing almost 250,000 visitors in two months. It closed for renovations in 2013;[94] it reopened on May 30, 2015, with new exhibits featuring giant anteaters, pudús, Linne's two-toed sloth, squirrel monkeys, Asian small-clawed otters, prairie dogs, fennec foxes, Nubian goats, zebus, alpacas, sheep, donkeys, chickens, ducks, pigs, geese, and domestic turkeys.[95] Congo Gorilla Forest[edit] Congo gorillas An adult male silverback In the southwestern part of the zoo, Congo Gorilla Forest is a 6.5-acre (2.6 ha) rainforest that is home to the 20 or so western lowland gorillas in the zoo. Angolan colobus, Wolf’s guenons, pygmy marmosets and mandrills also call this area home. Visitors walk through the area and can also view it from treetop lookouts.[96] The Congo Gorilla Forest was opened in 1999 and was visited 7,000,000 times as of 2009[update].[97] In one of the largest breeding groups of western lowland gorillas in North America, the exhibit has two troops of gorillas, for a total of 19 gorillas. Since 1999, 14 gorillas, 23 red river hogs, 11 Wolf's guenons, and four okapis have been born in the exhibit.[97] There is also an 8-minute film in the middle of the exhibit, as well as viewing points throughout. In total, there are about 400 animals from 55 species. Over $10.6 million for conservation of Central African habitats has been collected in donations since the exhibit's opening,[98] and the exhibit has netted $12.5 million in exhibit fees as of 2014[update].[99][100] JungleWorld[edit] Silvery lutungs (Trachypithecus cristatus), at JungleWorld This exhibit is an indoor tropical jungle and home to nearly 800 species[101] including Asian small-clawed otters, Javan lutungs, silvery lutungs, northern white-cheeked gibbons, Matschie's tree-kangaroos, gharials, Amur leopards, pygmy slow loris, greater mouse deer, and Malayan tapirs, living in mangroves and on the beaches. Visitors can watch the gibbons swinging or singing, and watch the otters play. The exhibit includes species that are usually on the jungle floor including stag beetles, scorpions, and fire-bellied toads, but behind glass. A pond with a waterfall lets visitors sit and observe gourami and Fly River turtles.[102] Planning for JungleWorld, in the southeastern Wild Asia portion of the zoo, was started in 1977 and completed at a cost of $9.5 million in June 1985. $4.1 million in funds were donated by Enid A. Haupt, a member of the New York Zoological Society's board of trustees.[103] The building is the largest at the zoo with an area of 1 acre (4,000 m2) and a height of 55 feet (17 m). There is a wooden path that meanders for 0.13 miles (210 m). The building's design integrates its environment with the path, as no bars are present in the building; the walkway has no full-height barriers and short railings; and only by means of ravines, streams, or cliffs are most of the animals separated from people and each other. There is a volcanic scrub forest, a mangrove swamp, a lowland evergreen rain forest with giant trees which merges into a mountain rain forest, and five museum-like galleries connecting and explaining the habitats.[103] The building was built to emphasize the fact that 150 acres (61 ha) of rainforest is lost every minute.[104] Wild Asia Monorail[edit] The Monorail The monorail was inaugurated in 1977 with the rest of the formerly underdeveloped Wild Asia section of the zoo. There are six 9-car monorails on this 1.6 miles (2.6 km) ride, originally built by Rohr; the ride was refurbished in 2007.[105] Some animals in the zoo can only be seen on this ride such as tigers, Przewalski's horse, Indian rhinoceros, Indian elephants, red pandas, and a plethora of even-toed ungulates such as axis deer, barasingha, blackbuck, gaurs, brow-antlered deer, babirusas, sambar deer, nilgai, red muntjacs, hog deer, Formosan sika deer, tufted deer, Himalayan tahrs, and markhors.[3] This ride takes visitors through a 40-acre (16 ha) area that recreates the mud wallows and pastures, forests and riverbanks of Asia. Visitors will see tigers, Indian elephants, and rhinos, and wild horses in their natural habitats. As the monorail travels along the Bronx River, visitors can see native animals including egrets, turtles, and ducks. The monorail is accessible for wheelchairs up to 26 inches (66 cm) wide. Smaller chairs are available at the monorail platform for visitors with wider wheelchairs or motorized scooters.[106] Nature Trek[edit] Nature Trek opened on July 1, 2017, in the southeast portion of the park near Wild Asia. It consists of twelve covered rope bridges[107] connecting small porches on the sides of towers.[108][109][110] There are also elevated tunnels and a large overlook, as well as several small challenges resembling American Ninja Warrior obstacles.[107] On the ground is a play area with a sandbox, water sprinklers and structures, and branches.[111][107] Nature Trek is partially wheelchair-accessible[107] and contains ramps of varying difficulties.[108] This attraction discourages visitors who are wearing footwear such as flip-flops; high heels are prohibited.[111] As part of a push for environmental sustainability, some parts of the attraction are made of black locust, and the structures use existing trees within the forest.[108] Bronx Zoo Treetop Adventure[edit] The Treetop Adventure section opened on July 7, 2017, in the northeast portion of the park near Bronx River Parking. It consists of seven different levels of rope courses: two each of beginner, intermediate, and advanced, and one expert course.[107] There is also a 400-foot (120 m) zip-line course traversing 50 feet (15 m) the Bronx River in both directions.[109][110] The attraction also contains rope and swinging bridges; ladders; and rolling and swinging objects. Separate from the rest of the zoo, it charges its own entry fee;[112][109] the fee is only applied to those who are climbing on the objects or using the zip-line.[112] Open year-round,[107] the attraction prohibits riders who are less than 7 years old and less than 50 pounds (23 kg), or more than 275 pounds (125 kg).[108][107] Dinosaur Safari[edit] Dinosaur Safari takes visitors on a safari ride through a normally off-exhibit 2-acre wooded area and features animatronic dinosaurs from throughout time, starting at 300-million-years ago in the Permian Period and ending 235-million-years later in the Cretaceous Period. The ride lasts approximately 20 minutes. The ""robo-saurs"" are manufactured by Billings Productions, who lease them out to sites all over the world. The exhibit features more popular species such as the Triceratops and Brachiosaurus, as well as less well-known species such as the Pachycephalosaurus. The ride's Dilophosaurus spit water at visitors as a nod to the species' acid-spitting abilities in Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park film and Michael Crichton's novel, even though there is no reason to believe the living animal did so.[113][114] The exhibit originally ran through the summers of 2013[113] and 2014[114] and returned for the 2019 season.[115] Exhibits closed after the 1990s[edit] World of Darkness[edit] World of Darkness opened in 1969 and was the world's first major exhibit designed specifically to introduce the public to nocturnal animals such as the Chinese leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis chinensis), bay duiker, Pallas's long-tongued bat, spiny mouse, lesser mouse lemur, small spotted genet, lesser spear-nosed bats, spotted skunk, fat-tailed lemurs Jamaican fruit bat, Mohol bushbaby, cloud rat, Hoffman's two-toed sloth, rock cavy, pygmy slow loris, short-tailed bats, striped skunk, grey-legged night monkey, sand cat, Rodriguez flying fox, brush-tailed porcupine, broad-snouted caiman, sand boa, and marine toad.[116] Built by Morris Ketchum, Jr. & Associates, the house was built where the zoo's Rocking Stone Restaurant stood until 1942. The exhibit used red-lights to dimly illuminate the enclosures within the windowless building. Like all nocturnal exhibits, the house ran on a reversed lighting schedule, which simulated night and day at opposite times to allow visitors to view nocturnal animals in a more naturalistic setting.[117] Due to budget cuts and the high cost of running the exhibit, it was closed in 2009.[31][32] Rare Animal Range[edit] Rare Animal Range was a trail which focused on highly endangered species.[116] Featured species included guanaco, Formosan sika deer, pied ruffed lemurs, and blue-eyed black lemurs.[118][119] The exhibit also had duplicate enclosures for the zoo's Arabian oryx, blesbok, Père David's deer, and broad-snouted caiman as well as a large pond with a pair of small islands in the center which were home to a pair of golden-cheeked gibbons. Due to budget cuts and the unpopularity of many of the species, the zoo was forced to close the exhibit in 2009.[31][32] While most of the species left the zoo when the exhibit closed, the Formosan sika deer were moved to the Wild Asia Monorail and the Père David's deer remained in their primary enclosure across from Tiger Mountain while the blue-eyed black lemurs were moved to Madagascar! where they are rotated with the Coquerel's sifakas. While no longer at the zoo, pied ruffed lemurs can still be seen at the zoo's partner institute, the Central Park Zoo.[120] The zoo's popular Dinosaur Safari ran through a part of this area and the zoo's yearly Run for the Wild event runs through its entirety. Skyfari[edit] The Skyfari was a popular gondola lift which transported visitors from the Zoo Center to the Asian Plaza, running over African Plains and several other popular exhibits at the zoo. The seasonal exhibit ran from April to October and rose 60 to 100 feet (18 to 30 m) feet in the air. With around 490,000 riders annually, the lift was the zoo's third most popular attraction after Congo Gorilla Forest and the Wild Asia Monorail. Despite its popularity, ticket sales for it were barely breaking-even and maintenance costs led to a loss of profit. On July 8, 2008, high winds and heat led to one of the cars derailing, which trapped thirty-six passengers for up to five hours.[121] Due to this, along with heavy budget cuts, the ride was permanently closed in January 2009, after 35 years of operation.[122] Monkey House[edit] The Monkey House, which first opened in 1901 and was originally named the Primate House, closed in late February 2012 after 111 years of operation.[123][124] At the time of closing, it was home to cotton-top tamarins, white-faced sakis, Wied's marmosets, moustached tamarins, black-chinned emperor tamarins, Goeldi's monkeys, and grey-handed night-monkeys, as well as Brazilian porcupines and Pallas's long-tongued bats. This was the building where Ota Benga spent most of his time during his stay at the zoo.[124] Some of the primates that were in the now-closed exhibit have been moved to other parts of the zoo, such as the cotton-top tamarins now being found in World of Birds; others were sent to other New York City zoos, such as the sakis being moved to the Central Park Zoo. White-headed capuchins can still be seen in an outdoor cage behind the building.[124] Amazing Amphibians[edit] Amazing Amphibians was a short-lived exhibition which opened in the zoo's Zoo Center in June 2008 and only remained for a few years. The exhibit featured several educational displays on amphibian conservation as well as a few terrariums containing several amphibian species. Highlight species included Chacoan horned frog, Puerto Rican crested toad, smooth-sided toad, and common mudpuppy.[125] While none of these species are currently on-exhibit at the zoo, the Puerto Rican crested toads can be seen at the Central Park Zoo, which breeds this species for reintroduction back into Puerto Rico.[126] 4-D Theater[edit] The 4-D Theater showed 4-D films with the help of 3-D film and built-in sensory effects, including moving seats, wind, mist, and scents.[127] Produced by SimEx-Iwerks, the theater showed condensed versions of popular children's movies. The 4-D Theater previously showed Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs , one episode of Dora the Explorer, Rio, and Storks. It closed in 2019. WCS's Run for the Wild[edit] In April 2008, the zoo hosted the first Run for the Wild event. The event is a 5k run (5 kilometres (3.1 mi) long) organized by the Wildlife Conservation Society with the goal of raising money and awareness for their conservation programs of endangered species. Each year, there is a set entry fee for participants with varying prices depending on age; child (3–15), adult, and senior (65+). WCS Members get a discounted fee. Along with the entry fee, there is a $35 minimum donation per adult/senior participant. The event offers free prizes for donors, based on donation size, ranging from a Run for the Wild T-shirt to a special animal experience at the zoo. All donations are tax-deductible. All participants are also offered free all-day entry to the zoo and its paid exhibits/attractions. The yearly event takes place at the end of April and originally began at 8am for those wishing to actually run, and 8:45 for those who wish to simply walk or jog; the start times were changed to 7am and 7:45am in later years.[128] The event takes participants through the zoo before opening hours, starting at the Bronx River Parkway Entrance, through the Asian Plaza and African Plains, and ending by the Rockefeller Fountain near Astor Court. The trail also takes runners through the now-closed section of the zoo where the Rare Animal Range once stood. Each year, the event focuses on a specific endangered species or animal group to help raise funds for: 2009's run was for gorillas, 2010 focused on tigers, 2011 helped raise funds to protect the Punta Tombo peninsula of Argentina for Magellanic penguins, 2012 focused on lions, both 2013 and 2014 focused on elephants, 2015 once again was for gorillas, and 2016's run will allow participants to run on behalf of their favorite animal.[128][129] In 2011, another WCS institute, the New York Aquarium, held its own Run for the Wild event for sea turtles in early October. The 5k run began at the aquarium and led down the Riegelmann Boardwalk on Coney Island.[130] The aquarium held a second run the following year for walruses.[131] The event has not returned to the aquarium since. Conservation[edit] In 1905, the zoo's first director, William T. Hornaday, along with President Theodore Roosevelt and other conservationists, created the American Bison Society (ABS) in an attempt to save the American bison from extinction. The bison had been depleted from tens-of-millions of animals to only a few hundred by the end of the 19th century due to westward expansion. The society worked to breed the species in captivity as well as raise public awareness, raise money to create protected reserves, and reintroduce bison back into the wild.[15] On October 11, 1907, the first reintroduction of bison began when the zoo sent six males and nine females, by rail, to the Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge in Oklahoma. Seven days later, the animals were successfully reintroduced to the park.[132] By 1935, the society, who had successfully carried out several more reintroductions from bison kept in zoos and ranches, considered their work done and disbanded that year. In 2005, the Wildlife Conservation Society resurrected and re-purposed the ABS to, ""help build the social and scientific foundations for the ecological restoration of bison,"" and, ""restore bison ecologically, not just animals in pens but actual functioning animals in the larger landscape,"" (Keith Aune, WCS bison coordinator).[133][134] According to a study published in 2012, virtually all wild and captive bison in the United States are hybrids with cattle genes, with the exception of the two distinct breeding populations within Yellowstone National Park and their descendants. The cattle genes entered the bison population due to private ranchers hybridizing their bison to make them more docile, with some of these animals being accidentally reintroduced by the ABS.[135] In response, in the fall of 2011, the WCS arranged for a herd of female bison originating from the American Prairie Reserve to be sent to the Colorado State University's Animal Reproduction & Biotechnology Laboratory to be used as surrogates in an attempt to transfer the fertilized embryos of genetically pure bison. After an ultrasound showed one female to be pregnant, the herd was moved to the zoo where, on June 20, 2012, the calf was born. The herd is kept in an off-exhibit section of the zoo and the goal is to eventually create a breeding herd of genetically pure bison through embryo transfers with the surrogate hybrid bison.[136] In 1981, the zoo successfully implanted a gaur embryo into a Holstein cow in an attempt to clone the endangered species.[5][137] In 1990, the zoo experienced a pest problem with the Canada goose. The park had become so over-crowded with the geese, that the zoo had to take action to decrease their numbers. Apart from their presence, the geese were very aggressive towards other birds and occasionally carried diseases into the park. To cope with the problem, the zoo hired a sharpshooter, who killed 19 geese. Zoo workers also destroyed 144 eggs found on the property. In 1991, the zoo employed a gentler method of sterilizing the birds.[138] In 2005, the zoo sent the frozen sperm of a male Indian rhinoceros to the Cincinnati Zoo where, four years later in 2009, it was thawed out and used in the first successful artificial insemination of the species when a calf was born in late 2010.[139] The calf did not survive long-term. In August 2006, the zoo adopted an orphaned snow leopard cub, named Leo. The 13-month-old cub was found stuck in mud following a landslide in Naltar Valley in Pakistan. The landslide had killed the cub's mother. A Pakistani shepherd in the area found the cub with its female sibling, but the female had died a week later due to malnutrition. He then handed over the male cub to Pakistani authorities to care for him. Since there are no captive breeding programs or rehabilitation centers for snow leopards in Pakistan, the authorities decided to send the cub to the Bronx Zoo. The cat will be returned to its place of birth following construction of a rehab facility in the Naltar Valley with cooperation from the United States.[6][140][141][142] On April 9, 2013, Leo sired a cub. He was the first cub of Leo.[143] In 2007, the zoo successfully reintroduced three Chinese alligators into the wild. In July 2009, the zoo announced that the reintroduced alligators had begun breeding naturally in the wild, producing 15 hatchlings. The breeding was a milestone in the zoo's 10-year effort to reintroduce the species to the Yangtze River in China.[144] In January 2010, the zoo adopted four abandoned brown bear cubs. Three of the bears, two males and one female, were siblings born in 2009 and rescued from the ABC Islands in Alaska. The cubs were named Kootz, Denali, and Sitka. The fourth cub, a grizzly bear born in 2008, was rescued from Glacier National Park in Montana and named Glacier after the park.[53] In 2015, two other rescued grizzly bears, who had been at the zoo since 1995, were sent to one of the zoo's partner institutions, the Central Park Zoo.[54] The next month, an ""assurance colony"" of Kihansi spray toads was placed in the zoo. The species disappeared in their native Tanzania home.[145] In February 2011, the zoo took in two bald eagles that were rescued in Wyoming. The 5-year-old male was found in 2008 and was believed to have been hit by a car. The 3-year-old female was believed to have been injured during a storm. The birds were taken in by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and sent to the Woodford Cedar Run Wildlife Refuge in New Jersey for evaluation and care, where it was decided they were unable to survive in the wild.[80] In December 2012, five Chinese yellow-headed box turtles, a critically endangered species, were born.[146] In December 2015, the zoo rescued a juvenile Indian cobra which had stowed away on a cargo ship destined for New Jersey. The snake was found in poor condition being dehydrated, cold, and exposed to oil residue. The animal was brought to the zoo for recovery. It's unclear how the snake got onto the ship since it set out from Singapore, which is outside of the species' natural range.[147] Incidents and controversies[edit] Human deaths[edit] On July 29, 1985, two female Siberian tigers killed 24-year-old animal keeper Robin Silverman after she entered their enclosure with a volunteer aide.[148] It was unclear why Silverman entered the enclosure; the zoo's general curator suspected a lapse in Silverman's concentration, while her family suspected a failure on the part of the zoo. It was the first fatality in the zoo's history.[149] Non-human deaths[edit] In the early 2000s, the zoo added a troop of Javan langurs to JungleWorld and mixed them with Oriental small-clawed otters. The otters had previously mixed with other primate species in the enclosure without any problems. However, the new langurs made a habit of constantly bothering and attacking the otters. In June 2007 a group of otters grabbed a langur that was sitting at the water's edge and proceeded to overpower, then drown it in full view of visitors. A keeper on the viewing deck attempted to break up the fight by whistling and yelling at the otters, to no avail. After killing the langur, the otters left the body floating in the pool. It was later removed by keepers. Part of the incident was recorded and uploaded to YouTube.[150] Soon after the incident, the otters were removed from the enclosure and given their own in the Children's Zoo and elsewhere in JungleWorld.[citation needed] Safety incidents[edit] In 2001, Peter Vitique, 32, climbed a 20-foot wall, entered the gorilla enclosure, and stripped down to his boxer shorts. He later told police that he wanted to be ""one with the gorillas.""[5] In 2004, a man stripped off his clothes in World of Darkness and jumped into the caiman enclosure. He was removed by zookeepers and police before he could sustain any injuries.[5] On July 9, 2008, the Skyfari, a now defunct gondola lift used to transport guests from the Zoo Center to Asia Plaza, broke down when high winds and heat caused one of the gondola cars to derail. Three dozen guests, several of them children, were stranded for approximately five hours at heights ranging from 60 to 100 feet (18 to 30 m) in elevation. A crane was brought into the zoo to evacuate the three guests in the derailed car, who were safely rescued after three hours. The car was then repaired and operations resumed, allowing the remaining passengers to exit normally. No serious injuries occurred as a result of the incident, although one couple sued. They claimed the ""psychological trauma"" of being stuck for five hours ""above fang-baring, flesh-eating baboons"" put the woman's pregnancy at risk. In January 2009, the zoo removed the Skyfari due to high maintenance costs.[122][151] On September 21, 2012, David Villalobos, 25, jumped off the Wild Asia Monorail and cleared the 16-foot (4.9 m) high perimeter fence around the area into the tiger exhibit. During the 10 minutes that he was in the enclosure, Villalobos was alone with an 11-year-old male Amur tiger named Bashuta, a three-year resident of the zoo at the time, before being mauled. Villalobos was attacked on his shoulder, arms, legs, and back, before he was rescued by zoo officials who used fire extinguishers to chase the tiger away and told Villalobos to escape by rolling under a wire. Villalobos was taken to an area hospital and reported in stable condition. He had petted the 400-pound animal and wanted to be ""one with the tiger"".[152] The tiger was not euthanized as a result of the incident, since it was clearly provoked, and the mauling did not result in a fatality.[153][154] In the summer of 2013, New Jersey residents Heung Ju Yi and Kyung Hee brought their 3-year-old son, Ethan, to the zoo to visit the popular Dinosaur Safari exhibit. After buying their tickets, each member of the family was given a free souvenir pressed penny as a gift promoting the exhibit. Soon afterward, Ethan swallowed the coin and began choking. His mother, Kyung, said she'd, ""thought he'd died.""[155] Unsuccessful attempts to retrieve the coin from his throat were followed by rushing the boy to an emergency medical clinic, where X-rays showed it had entered his stomach. The next day, further X-rays revealed that the coin was not passing naturally, and surgery was required to remove it.[155] Two days later, Ethan was put under general anesthesia, and the coin was removed via endoscopy. The surgery revealed that the zinc in the coin had reacted with his stomach acid and begun to dissolve, creating jagged edges that cut the inside of his stomach. The family, which did not have health insurance, were charged over $50,000 for this.[155] In early 2014, the family pressed charges against the zoo and the Wildlife Conservation Society for unspecified damages. They claimed the zoo endangered their son since the employee who handed them the coins handed Ethan's directly to him and gave no warning about the choking hazards of small coins.[155] Animal escapes[edit] In 1902, a 7-month-old male jaguar broke out of his cage and escaped.[5] In February 1995, the zoo's De Jur Aviary collapsed during a snowstorm with about 100 seabirds, including Inca terns and gulls, inside. During the collapse, some of the residents flew off and escaped. In total, about 30 birds were lost.[65] On March 26, 2011, the Bronx Zoo announced that World of Reptiles was closed after a venomous adolescent cobra was discovered missing from its off-exhibit enclosure on March 25. Zoo officials were confident the missing cobra would be found in the building and not outside, since the species is known to be uncomfortable in open areas.[156] The missing snake quickly sparked a popular Twitter parody account, @BronxZoosCobra,[157] which narrated the daily hijinks of the cobra.[158] On March 31, zoo authorities found the snake in a non-public area of the reptile house.[159] On May 9, 2011, a female green peafowl escaped from the zoo before being caught on May 11.[160] On September 11, 2011, a lesser kudu escaped from its enclosure for about half an hour and then returned to its enclosure once a zoo worker opened the gate.[161] Happy the Elephant[edit] In the early 1970s, seven Indian elephants, named after the Seven Dwarfs from Snow White, were captured as calves in Thailand and dispersed among multiple U.S. zoos and circuses. Two of those calves, named Grumpy and Happy, were brought to the zoo in 1977. Over the next 25 years, the pair lived together, separated from the zoo's other elephants. In July 2002, the zoo attempted to mix the pair with two females, Patty and Maxine. However, the introduction failed when Patty and Maxine attacked the pair and injured Grumpy. Over the next several months, the elephant's injuries worsened and, in October of that year, the zoo was forced to euthanize her. With her lifelong companion gone, Happy was paired with the zoo's younger female, Sammy, whose companion Tus had also died in 2002. The two got along very well until Sammy developed severe liver disease and was also euthanized in early 2006. This left Patty, Maxine, and Happy as the zoo's only remaining elephants.[162] Despite the fact that elephants are highly social animals, the zoo decided that making a second attempt at introducing Happy to the others was too risky, with there being too high a chance that she'd be attacked. She has since lived without the company of other elephants. Due to this, the zoo has been criticized by multiple animal rights organizations for supposedly mistreating Happy. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) filed a formal complaint against the zoo with the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA), calling for them to strip the zoo of its accreditation. In Defense of Animals (IDA) has named the zoo the ""Hall of Shame Winner"" on their 2015, 2016, and 2017 'Ten Worst Zoos for Elephants'.[163] IDA listed the zoo fourth on their 2012 list,[164] fifth on their 2013 and 2014 lists,[165][166] and eighth on their 2009 list.[167] The organizations, as well as many online petitions (some of which gain up to 200,000 supporters), have called on the zoo to send Happy to an elephant sanctuary. However, the zoo said that moving her at this stage in her life might be potentially traumatizing for her, and that she has very strong bonds with her keepers and is well-adjusted to the zoo, where she has spent well over thirty years of her life.[162][168] In 2012, a reporter for the New York Post wrote that she is kept inside all year and in solitary confinement. The zoo claims that she and the other two elephants have equal access to outdoor yards, and that the three elephants have limited interactions with each other and extensive interactions with zoo keepers. All three animals share the same barn, but Happy lives in separate stalls and yards.[168] In late 2018, one of the zoo's other elephants, Maxine, was euthanized due to complications with her liver and kidneys.[169] A lawsuit against the Bronx Zoo, stating that Happy was legally ""a person with a right to be free"", was dismissed in 2020.[170] However, in May 2021, the New York Court of Appeals agreed to hear the appeal, filed on behalf of Happy by the Nonhuman Rights Project.[171] Ota Benga[edit] Main article: Ota Benga Ota Benga at the Bronx Zoo in 1906. Only five promotional photos exist of Benga's time here, none of them in the Monkey House; cameras were not allowed.[172](pPhoto insert) In 1906, a major controversy erupted when Ota Benga, a Mbuti pygmy, was brought to the zoo by the American businessman and explorer Samuel Phillips Verner, and displayed there as an exhibit; though he was allowed to roam the grounds freely. He became fond of an orangutan named Dohong, ""the presiding genius of the Monkey House"", who had been taught to perform tricks and imitate human behavior.[172]:172–174 The events leading to his ""exhibition"" alongside Dohong were gradual. Benga spent some of his time in the Monkey House exhibit, where the zoo encouraged him to hang his hammock and to shoot his bow and arrow at a target. On the first day of the exhibit, September 8, 1906, visitors found Benga in the Monkey House.[173] Soon, a sign on the exhibit read: The African Pigmy, ""Ota Benga."" Age, 23 years. Height, 4 feet 11 inches. Weight, 103 pounds. Brought from the Kasai River, Congo Free State, South Central Africa, by Dr. Samuel P. Verner. Exhibited each afternoon during September.[174] Hornaday considered the exhibit a valuable spectacle for visitors; he was supported by Madison Grant, secretary of the New York Zoological Society, who lobbied to put Benga on-display alongside apes at the zoo. A decade later, Grant became prominent nationally as a racial anthropologist and eugenicist.[172]:173–175 African-American clergymen immediately protested to zoo officials about the exhibit. James H. Gordon said, ""Our race, we think, is depressed enough, without exhibiting one of us with the apes ... We think we are worthy of being considered human beings, with souls.""[173] Gordon also thought the exhibit was hostile to Christianity and a promotion of Darwinism: ""The Darwinian theory is absolutely opposed to Christianity, and a public demonstration in its favor should not be permitted.""[173] A number of clergymen backed Gordon.[175]:47 In defense of the depiction of Benga as a lesser human, an editorial in The New York Times suggested: We do not quite understand all the emotion which others are expressing in the matter ... It is absurd to make moan over the imagined humiliation and degradation Benga is suffering. The pygmies ... are very low in the human scale, and the suggestion that Benga should be in a school instead of a cage ignores the high probability that school would be a place ... from which he could draw no advantage whatever. The idea that men are all much alike except as they have had or lacked opportunities for getting an education out of books is now far out of date.[175]:48 After the controversy, Benga was allowed to roam the grounds of the zoo. In response to the situation, as well as verbal and physical prods from the crowds, he became more mischievous and somewhat violent.[176]:Chapter on Ota Benga Around this time, Rev. Dr. R. MacArthur of Calvary Baptist Church, was quoted in The New York Times saying: ""It is too bad that there is not some society like the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. We send our missionaries to Africa to Christianize the people, and then we bring one here to brutalize him."" Soon, the zoo removed Benga from the grounds.[174][177] Benga committed suicide in 1916 at the age of 32.[178] In 2020, WCS apologized for the zoo's treatment of Benga and promotion of eugenics.[179] In popular culture[edit] In 2013, So What? Press published an issue of its comic series Tales of the Night Watchman, entitled ""The Night Collector"", about a coven of vampires that takes over the bat exhibit at the Bronx Zoo. A zookeeper who specializes in bats is put at odds with his co-worker when it's discovered that the woman of their mutual affection has been turned into a vampire. It was written by Dave Kelly and illustrated by Molly Ostertag.[180] In March 2016, Animal Planet announced plans to produce a docu-series about the zoo, titled The Zoo. The series premiered on February 18, 2017[181] and gained a second season in March 2018.[182] References[edit] ^ ""Wildlife Conservation Society"". fundinguniverse.com. Funding Universe.

He was the eldest son of prominent railroad tycoon William Henry Osborn and his wife, Virginia Reed (née Sturges) Osborn.[3] His younger brother was William Church Osborn,[4] who served as president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art,[5] and married philanthropist and social reformer Alice Clinton Hoadley Dodge, a daughter of William E. Dodge Jr.[6] His maternal grandparents were Jonathan Sturges, a prominent New York businessman and arts patron who was a direct descendant of Jonathan Sturges, a U.S. Representative from Connecticut, and Mary Pemberton Cady, a direct descendant of prominent educator Ebenezer Pemberton.[7] His maternal aunt Amelia Sturges, was the first wife of J. P. Morgan, but died of tuberculosis soon after their wedding.[8] From 1873 to 1877, Osborn studied at Princeton University, obtaining a B.A. in geology and archaeology, where he was mentored by paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope. Two years later, Osborn took a special course of study in anatomy in the College of Physicians and Surgeons and Bellevue Medical School of New York under Dr. William H. Welch, and subsequently studied embryology and comparative anatomy under Thomas Huxley as well as Francis Maitland Balfour at Cambridge University, England.[9][10] In 1880, Osborn obtained a Sc.D. in paleontology from Princeton, becoming a lecturer in Biology and Professor of Comparative Anatomy from the same university between 1883 and 1890. Career[edit] In 1891, Osborn was hired by Columbia University as a professor of zoology; simultaneously, he accepted a position at the American Museum of Natural History, New York, where he served as the curator of a newly formed Department of Vertebrate Paleontology. As a curator, he assembled a remarkable team of fossil hunters and preparators, including William King Gregory; Roy Chapman Andrews, a possible inspiration for the creation of the fictional archeologist Indiana Jones; and Charles R. Knight, who made murals of dinosaurs in their habitats and sculptures of the living creatures. On November 23, 1897 he was elected member of the Boone and Crockett Club, a wildlife conservation organization founded by Theodore Roosevelt and George Bird Grinnell.[11] Thanks to his considerable family wealth and personal connections, he succeeded Morris K. Jesup as the president of the museum's Board of Trustees in 1908, serving until 1933, during which time he accumulated one of the finest fossil collections in the world.[12] Additionally, Osborn served as President of the New York Zoological Society from 1909 to 1925. Osborn (third from the right) with other officers of the paleontology section of the St Louis Congress Long a member of the US Geological Survey, Osborn became its senior vertebrate paleontologist in 1924. He led many fossil-hunting expeditions into the American Southwest, starting with his first to Colorado and Wyoming in 1877. Osborn conducted research on Tyrannosaurus brains by cutting open fossilized braincases with a diamond saw.[13] (Modern researchers use computed tomography scans and 3D reconstruction software to visualize the interior of dinosaur endocrania without damaging valuable specimens.)[14] He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1886.[15] He accumulated a number of prizes for his work in paleontology. In 1901, Osborn was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[16] He described and named Ornitholestes in 1903, Tyrannosaurus rex and Albertosaurus in 1905, Pentaceratops in 1923, and Velociraptor in 1924. In 1929 Osborn was awarded the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal from the National Academy of Sciences.[17] Despite his considerable scientific stature during the 1900s and 1910s, Osborn's scientific achievements have not held up well, for they were undermined by continuous efforts to bend scientific findings to fit his own racist and eugenist viewpoints. His legacy at the American Museum has proved more enduring. Biographer Ronald Rainger has described Osborn as ""a first-rate science administrator and a third-rate scientist.""[18] Indeed, Osborn's greatest contributions to science ultimately lay in his efforts to popularize it through visual means. At his urging, staff members at the American Museum of Natural History invested new energy in display, and the museum became one of the pre-eminent sites for exhibition in the early twentieth century as a result. The murals, habitat dioramas, and dinosaur mounts executed during his tenure at the museum attracted millions of visitors, and inspired other museums to imitate his innovations.[19] But his decision to invest heavily in exhibition also alienated certain members of the scientific community and angered curators hoping to spend more time on their own research.[20] Additionally, his efforts to imbue the museum's exhibits and educational programs with his own racist and eugenist beliefs disturbed many of his contemporaries and have marred his legacy.[21] Theories[edit] Dawn Man Theory[edit] Osborn developed his own evolutionary theory of human origins called the ""Dawn Man Theory"". His theory was founded on the discovery of Piltdown Man (Eoanthropus) which was dated to the Late (Upper) Pliocene. Writing before Piltdown was exposed as a hoax, the Eoanthropus or ""Dawn Man"" Osborn maintained sprang from a common ancestor with the ape during the Oligocene period which he believed developed entirely separately during the Miocene (16 million years ago). Therefore, Osborn argued that all apes (Simia, following the pre-Darwinian classification of Linnaeus) had evolved entirely parallel to the ancestors of man (homo).[22][23][24][25] Osborn himself wrote: We have all borne with the ape and monkey and ape hypothesis long enough are we are glad to welcome this new idea of the aristocracy of man back to a even remote period than the beginning of the stone age.[26] While believing in common ancestry between man and ape, Osborn denied that this ancestor was ape-like. The common ancestor between man and ape Osborn always maintained was more human than ape. Writing to Arthur Keith in 1927, he remarked ""when our Oligocene ancestor is found it will not be an ape, but it will be surprisingly pro-human"".[27] His student William K. Gregory called Osborn's idiosyncratic view on man's origins as a form of ""Parallel Evolution"", but many creationists misinterpreted Osborn, greatly frustrating him, and believed he was asserting humankind had never evolved from a lower life form.[28] Evolutionary views[edit] Osborn was originally a supporter of Edward Drinker Cope's neo-Lamarckism, however he later abandoned this view. Osborn became a proponent of organic selection, also known as the Baldwin effect.[29] Osborn was a believer in orthogenesis; he coined the term aristogenesis for his theory. His aristogenesis was based on a ""physicochemical approach"" to evolution.[29] He believed that aristogenes operate as biomechanisms in the geneplasm of the organism. He also held the view that mutations and natural selection play no creative role in evolution and that aristogenesis was the origin of new novelty.[30] Osborn equated this struggle for evolutionary advancement with the striving for spiritual salvation, thereby combining his biological and spiritual viewpoints.[31] Race[edit] He advocated a common view of the time, namely that heredity is superior to influences from the environment. As an extension of this, he accepted that distinct races existed with fixed hereditary traits, and held the Nordic or Anglo-Saxon ""race"" to be highest. Osborn therefore supported eugenics to preserve ""good"" racial stock. Due to this, he endorsed Madison Grant's The Passing of the Great Race, writing both the second and fourth prefaces of the book, which argued for such views.[32] The book was also largely influential on Adolf Hitler. Hitler called the book ‘his bible’ for it advocated a rigid system of selection through the elimination of those who are weak or unfit.[33] Personal life[edit] His country home, Castle Rock in Garrison, New York, 2009. In June 1881, Osborn was married to writer Lucretia Thatcher Perry (1858–1930) at the military chapel on Governors Island.[34] She was the daughter of Brigadier General Alexander James Perry and Josephine (Adams) Perry, and a descendant of Justice Christopher Raymond Perry).[35] Lucretia's sister, Josephine Adams Perry, was the wife of banker Junius Spencer Morgan II.[36] Osborn and his wife had five children, one of whom died in childhood:[37][38] Virginia Sturges Osborn (1882–1955), married firstly Ralph Sanger (1882–1918); married secondly Robert Gordon McKay (1877–1958).[38] Fairfield Osborn Sanger (1907–1917) Alexander Perry Osborn (1884–1951), a lawyer and banker who married secondly Marie Cantrell (1903–1988).[39] His first marriage was to Anne Maynadier Steele (1894–1977), and resulted in a divorce. Alexander Perry Osborn Jr. (1917–1974), married Marion Lawrence (1918–2010), a great-great-granddaughter of Abbott Lawrence and twice-divorced mother of four. Her first marriage was to Robert B. Cutler. Alexander Perry Osborn III (1955–2008)[40] Alexander Perry Osborn IV Gary Wayne Osborn David Eugene Osborn Henry Fairfield Osborn Jr. (1887–1969), known as Fairfield Osborn, naturalist and conservationist who married Marjorie Mary Lamond (1892–1989).[41] Josephine Adams Osborn (1890–1976), who married James ""Jay"" Coogan Jr. (1886–1974).[42] Rhoda Gordon Coogan (1923–2000), married Charles Cary (1916–1985), the son of George Cary and great-grandson of Trumbull Cary and Thomas C. Love. Trumbull Cary (b. 1952), married Eleanor Lamont Cunningham (b. 1959), a descendant of Edward Burnett and James Russell Lowell. Nicholas Cunningham Cary (b. 1993) Medeleine Lamont Cary (b. 1996) William Cromwell Cary (b. 1996) Gurdon Saltonstall Osborn (1895–1896), who died young.[43][44] After his father's death in 1894,[3] Osborn inherited his Rhenish style home, Castle Rock, in Garrison, New York in the Hudson Highlands, which his father had purchased in 1859, and where he concentrated on his philanthropy after his 1882 retirement.[45] After his mother's death in 1902, the remainder of his parent's estate was equally divided between Henry and his brother William.[46] Following an ""illness of nearly a year"", his wife died at their country home in August 1930.[34] Osborn died suddenly on November 6, 1935 in his study at Castle Rock, overlooking the Hudson River.[2] Eponyms[edit] An African dwarf crocodile, Osteolaemus osborni, was named in his honor by Karl Patterson Schmidt in 1919.[47] Published books[edit] From the Greeks to Darwin: An Outline of the Development of the Evolution Idea (1894) Present Problems in Evolution and Heredity (1892) Evolution of Mammalian Molar Teeth: To and From the Triangular Type (1907) Men of the Old Stone Age: Their Environment Life and Art (1915) The Origin and Evolution of Life (1916) Men of the Old Stone Age (1916) The Age of Mammals in Europe, Asia and North America (1921) Evolution and Religion (1923) Evolution And Religion In Education (1926) Man Rises to Parnassus', Critical Epochs in the Pre-History of Man (1927) Aristogenesis, the Creative Principle in the Origin of Species (1934) References[edit] ^ Woodward, A.

161,"Wildlife conservation - Wikipedia Wildlife conservation From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (Redirected from Species conservation) Jump to navigation Jump to search Practice of protecting wild plant and animal species and their habitats Ankeny Wildlife Refuge in Oregon. Wildlife conservation refers to the practice of protecting wild species and their habitats in order to maintain healthy wildlife species or populations and to restore, protect or enhance natural ecosystems. Major threats to wildlife include habitat destruction, degradation, fragmentation, overexploitation, poaching, pollution and climate change. The IUCN estimates that 27,000 species of the ones assessed are at risk for extinction. Expanding to all existing species, a 2019 UN report on biodiversity put this estimate even higher at a million species. It is also being acknowledged that an increasing number of ecosystems on Earth containing endangered species are disappearing. To address these issues, there have been both national and international governmental efforts to preserve Earth's wildlife. Prominent conservation agreements include the 1973 Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).[1][2] There are also numerous nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) dedicated to conservation such as the Nature Conservancy, World Wildlife Fund, and Conservation International.

Habitat destruction[edit] Habitat destruction decreases the number of places wildlife can live in. Habitat fragmentation breaks up a continuous tract of habitat, often dividing large wildlife populations into several smaller ones.[3] Human-caused habitat loss and fragmentation are primary drivers of species declines and extinctions. Key examples of human-induced habitat loss include deforestation, agricultural expansion, and urbanization. Habitat destruction and fragmentation can increase the vulnerability of wildlife populations by reducing the space and resources available to them and by increasing the likelihood of conflict with humans. Moreover, destruction and fragmentation create smaller habitats. Smaller habitats support smaller populations, and smaller populations are more likely to go extinct.[4] Overexploitation[edit] Overexploitation is the harvesting of animals and plants at a rate that's faster than the species's ability to recover. While often associated with Overfishing, overexploitation can apply to many groups including mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and plants.[5] The danger of overexploitation is that if too many individuals of a species are taken, then the species may not recover.[6] For example, overfishing of top marine predatory fish like tuna and salmon over the past century has led to a decline in fish sizes as well as fish numbers.[3] [[File:Illegal wildlife trade confiscated skins.jpeg|thumb|275x275px|Confiscated animal pelts from the illegal wildlife trade.|alt=]] Poaching[edit] Poaching for illegal wildlife trading is a major threat to certain species, particularly endangered ones whose status makes them economically valuable.[7] Such species include many large mammals like African elephants, tigers, and rhinoceros. [traded for their tusks, skins, and horns respectively].[7][8] Less well-known targets of poaching include the harvest of protected plants and animals for souvenirs, food, skins, pets, and more; Because poachers tend to target threatened and endangered species, poaching causes already small populations to decline even further.[citation needed] Culling[edit] Main article: Culling Culling is the deliberate and selective killing of wildlife by governments for various purposes. An example of this is shark culling, in which ""shark control"" programs in Queensland and New South Wales (in Australia) have killed thousands of sharks, as well as turtles, dolphins, whales, and other marine life.[9][10][11] The Queensland ""shark control"" program alone has killed about 50,000 sharks — it has also killed more than 84,000 marine animals.[12][9] There are also examples of population culling in the United States, such as bison in Montana and swans, geese, and deer in New York and other places.[13][14] Aerial view of the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010. Pollution[edit] A wide range of pollutants negatively impact wildlife health. For some pollutants, simple exposure is enough to do damage (e.g. pesticides). For others, its through inhaling (e.g. air pollutants) or ingesting it (e.g. toxic metals). Pollutants affect different species in different ways so a pollutant that is bad for one might not affect another. Air pollutants: Most air pollutants come from burning fossil fuels and industrial emissions. These have direct and indirect effects on the health of wildlife and their ecosystems. For example, high levels of sulfur oxides (SOx) can damage plants and stunt their growth.[15] Sulfur oxides also contribute to acid rain, harming both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Other air pollutants like smog, ground-level ozone, and particulate matter decrease air quality. Heavy metals: Heavy metals like arsenic, lead, and mercury naturally occur at low levels in the environment, but when ingested in high doses, can cause organ damage and cancer.[16] How toxic they are depends on the exact metal, how much was ingested, and the animal that ingested it. Human activities such as mining, smelting, burning fossil fuels, and various industrial processes have contributed to the rise in heavy metal levels in the environment. Toxic chemicals: There are many sources of toxic chemical pollution including industrial wastewater, oil spills, and pesticides. There's a wide range of toxic chemicals so there's also a wide range of negative health effects. For example, synthetic pesticides and certain industrial chemicals are persistent organic pollutants. These pollutants are long-lived and can cause cancer, reproductive disorders, immune system problems, and nervous system problems.[17] Climate change[edit] Main article: Climate change Humans are responsible for present-day climate change currently changing Earth's environmental conditions. It is related to some of the aforementioned threats to wildlife like habitat destruction and pollution. Rising temperatures, melting ice sheets, changes in precipitation patterns, severe droughts, more frequent heat waves, storm intensification, and rising sea levels are some of the effects of climate change.[18] Phenomena like droughts, heatwaves, intense storms, and rising sea levels, directly lead to habitat destruction. Meanwhile, a warming climate, fluctuating precipitation, and changing weather patterns will impact species ranges. Overall, the effects of climate change increase stress on ecosystems, and species unable to cope with rapidly changing conditions will go extinct.[19] While modern climate change is caused by humans, past climate change events occurred naturally and have led to extinctions.[citation needed] Species conservation[edit] Leatherback sea turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) It is estimated that, because of human activities, current species extinction rates are about 1000 times greater than the background extinction rate (the 'normal' extinction rate that occurs without additional influence).[20] According to the IUCN, out of all species assessed, over 27,000 are at risk of extinction and should be under conservation.[21] Of these, 25% are mammals, 14% are birds, and 40% are amphibians.[21] However, because not all species have been assessed, these numbers could be even higher. A 2019 UN report assessing global biodiversity extrapolated IUCN data to all species and estimated that 1 million species worldwide could face extinction.[22][23] Yet, because resources are limited, sometimes it is not possible to give all species that need conservation due consideration. Deciding which species to conserve is a function of how close to extinction a species is, whether the species is crucial to the ecosystem it resides in, and how much we care about it.[editorializing][citation needed] Leatherback sea turtle[edit] Main article: Leatherback sea turtle The leatherback sea turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) is the largest turtle in the world, is the only turtle without a hard shell, and is endangered.[24] It is found throughout the central Pacific and Atlantic Oceans but several of its populations are in decline across the globe (though not all). The leatherback sea turtle faces numerous threats including being caught as bycatch, harvest of its eggs, loss of nesting habitats, and marine pollution.[24] In the US where the leatherback is listed under the Endangered Species Act, measures to protect it include reducing bycatch captures through fishing gear modifications, monitoring and protecting its habitat (both nesting beaches and in the ocean), and reducing damage from marine pollution.[25] There is currently an international effort to protect the leatherback sea turtle.[24] Habitat conservation[edit] Red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) Habitat conservation is the practice of protecting a habitat in order to protect the species within it.[3] This is sometimes preferable to focusing on a single species especially if the species in question has very specific habitat requirements or lives in a habitat with many other endangered species. The latter is often true of species living in biodiversity hotspots, which are areas of the world with an exceptionally high concentration of endemic species (species found nowhere else in the world).[26] Many of these hotspots are in the tropics, mainly tropical forests like the Amazon. Habitat conservation is usually carried out by setting aside protected areas like national parks or nature reserves. Even when an area isn't made into a park or reserve, it can still be monitored and maintained. Red-cockaded woodpecker[edit] Main article: Red-cockaded woodpecker The red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) is an endangered bird in the southeastern US.[27] It only lives in longleaf pine savannas which are maintained by wildfires in mature pine forests. Today, it is a rare habitat (as fires have become rare and many pine forests have been cut down for agriculture) and is commonly found on land occupied by US military bases, where pine forests are kept for military training purposes and occasional bombings (also for training) set fires that maintain pine savannas.[3] Woodpeckers live in tree cavities they excavate in the trunk. In an effort to increase woodpecker numbers, artificial cavities (essentially birdhouses planted within tree trunks) were installed to give woodpeckers a place to live. An active effort is made by the US military and workers to maintain this rare habitat used by red-cockaded woodpeckers. Conservation genetics[edit] Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi) Conservation genetics studies genetic phenomena that impact the conservation of a species. Most conservation efforts focus on ensuring population growth but genetic diversity also greatly affect species survival. High genetic diversity increases survival because it means greater capacity to adapt to future environmental changes.[4] Meanwhile, effects associated with low genetic diversity, such as inbreeding depression and loss of diversity from genetic drift, often decrease species survival by reducing the species' capacity to adapt or by increasing the frequency of genetic problems. Though not always the case, certain species are under threat because they have very low genetic diversity. As such, the best conservation action would be to restore their genetic diversity. Florida panther[edit] Main article: Florida panther The Florida panther is a subspecies of puma (specifically Puma concolor coryi) that resides in the state of Florida and is currently endangered.[28] Historically, the Florida panther's range covered the entire southeastern US. In the early 1990s, only a single population with 20-25 individuals were left. The population had very low genetic diversity, was highly inbred, and suffered from several genetic issues including kinked tails, cardiac defects, and low fertility.[4] In 1995, 8 female Texas pumas were introduced to the Florida population. The goal was to increase genetic diversity by introducing genes from a different, unrelated puma population. By 2007, the Florida panther population had tripled and offspring between Florida and Texas individuals had higher fertility and less genetic problems. In 2015, the US Fish and Wildlife Service estimated there were 230 adult Florida panthers and in 2017, there were signs that the population's range was expanding within Florida.[28] Conservation methods[edit] Wildlife population monitoring[edit] Non-invasive monitoring of dhole is crucial for knowledge about its conservation status. More research is needed in chinese wilderness. Monitoring of wildlife populations is an important part of conservation because it allows managers to gather information about the status of threatened species and to measure the effectiveness of management strategies. Monitoring can be local, regional, or range-wide, and can include one or many distinct populations. Metrics commonly gathered during monitoring include population numbers, geographic distribution, and genetic diversity, although many other metrics may be used. Monitoring methods can be categorized as either ""direct"" or ""indirect"". Direct methods rely on directly seeing or hearing the animals, whereas indirect methods rely on ""signs"" that indicate the animals are present. For terrestrial vertebrates, common direct monitoring methods include direct observation, mark-recapture, transects, and variable plot surveys. Indirect methods include track stations, fecal counts, food removal, open or closed burrow-opening counts, burrow counts, runaway counts, knockdown cards, snow tracks, or responses to audio calls.[29] For large, terrestrial vertebrates, a popular method is to use camera traps for population estimation along with mark-recapture techniques. This method has been used successfully with tigers, black bears and numerous other species.[30][31] Trail cameras can be triggered remotely and automatically via sound, infrared sensors, etc. Computer vision-based animal individual re-identification methods have been developed to automate such sight-resight calculations.[32][33] Mark-recapture methods are also used with genetic data from non-invasive hair or fecal samples.[34] Such information can be analyzed independently or in conjunction with photographic methods to get a more complete picture of population viability. Government involvement[edit] In the US, the Endangered Species Act of 1973 was passed to protect US species deemed in danger of extinction.[35] The concern at the time was that the country was losing species that were scientifically, culturally, and educationally important. In the same year, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora (CITES) was passed as part of an international agreement to prevent the global trade of endangered wildlife.[1] In 1980, the World Conservation Strategy was developed by the IUCN with help from the UN Environmental Programme, World Wildlife Fund, UN Food and Agricultural Organization, and UNESCO.[36] Its purpose was to promote the conservation of living resources important to humans. In 1992, the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) was agreed on at the UN Conference on Environment and Development (often called the Rio Earth Summit) as an international accord to protect the Earth's biological resources and diversity.[2] According to the National Wildlife Federation, wildlife conservation in the US gets a majority of its funding through appropriations from the federal budget, annual federal and state grants, and financial efforts from programs such as the Conservation Reserve Program, Wetlands Reserve Program and Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program.[37][38] A substantial amount of funding comes from the sale of hunting/fishing licenses, game tags, stamps, and excise taxes from the purchase of hunting equipment and ammunition.[39] Non-government involvement[edit] In the late 1980s, as the public became dissatisfied with government environmental conservation efforts, people began supporting private sector conservation efforts which included several non-governmental organizations (NGOs) .[40] Seeing this rise in support for NGOs, the U.S. Congress made amendments to the Foreign Assistance Act in 1979 and 1986 “earmarking U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) funds for [biodiversity]”.[40] From 1990 till now, environmental conservation NGOs have become increasingly more focused on the political and economic impact of USAID funds dispersed for preserving the environment and its natural resources.[41] After the terrorist attacks on 9/11 and the start of former President Bush's War on Terror, maintaining and improving the quality of the environment and its natural resources became a “priority” to “prevent international tensions” according to the Legislation on Foreign Relations Through 2002[41] and section 117 of the 1961 Foreign Assistance Act.[41] Non-governmental organizations[edit] Many NGOs exist to actively promote, or be involved with, wildlife conservation: The Nature Conservancy is a US charitable environmental organization that works to preserve the plants, animals, and natural communities that represent the diversity of life on Earth by protecting the lands and waters they need to survive.[42] World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) is an international non-governmental organization working on the issues regarding the conservation, research and restoration of the environment, formerly named the World Wildlife Fund, which remains its official name in Canada and the United States. It is the world's largest independent conservation organization with over 5 million supporters worldwide, working in more than 90 countries, supporting around 1300[4] conservation and environmental projects around the world. It is a charity, with approximately 60% of its funding coming from voluntary donations by private individuals. 45% of the fund's income comes from the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States.[43] Conservation International Fauna and Flora International WildTeam Wildlife Conservation Society Audubon Society Traffic (conservation programme) Born Free Foundation African Wildlife Defence Force Save Cambodia's Wildlife WildEarth Guardians See also[edit] Conservation movement Conservation biology Endangered species Refuge (ecology) Wildlife management References[edit] ^ a b ""What is CITES?"".

Around the world, land and water resources are coming under increasing pressure, even as the need to slow the pace of climate change becomes more clear. Our lands, forests, rivers, oceans, and wildlife are under threat—as are many communities worldwide that need clean energy and deserve social justice. The complexity and scale of the issues we face are daunting. But the opportunities are also significant. Committed activists have recently made important strides in conservation and climate work, and we see more opportunities on the horizon. By working together, donors and investors committed to protecting the future of our shared world can learn from one another, build relationships across sectors, and pool resources to achieve greater impact. We recently supported organizations working behind the scenes at COP21, the United Nations climate change conference, helping them build strategies and execute grants that helped bring marginalized groups to the negotiating table. We’ve also worked with multiple funders to implement collaborative conservation projects that are protecting land and water resources in the United States and abroad. Whatever your conservation and climate goals, we can help you navigate this complex funding landscape and achieve real impact on behalf of your community and the planet as a whole. The Windward Fund In 2015, the Windward Fund was founded in response to donors who expressed a desire to be more connected to their peers’ work, and to partner with experts in conservation nonprofit management to execute bold initiatives. Conservation and climate specialists from Arabella help to manage the fund and its programs, enabling donors to collaborate and increase their impact both domestically and abroad. Learn More Team Contact: Bruce Boyd, Senior Managing Director Bruce Boyd leads the firm’s portfolio of environment-related projects. He provides guidance to family and institutional clients on developing philanthropic strategies in the areas of clean water protection, climate change mitigation and adaptation, and sustainable agriculture and local food. Bruce has also worked extensively with institutional foundation and family clients to support a just transition to a clean energy economy. View Bio Contact Bruce Boyd Principal and Senior Managing Director Bruce Boyd joined Arabella Advisors in 2007 as a Principal and Senior Managing Director after spending 20 years building and leading for-profit and nonprofit ventures. Bruce is based in Chicago and has worked with Arabella’s individual, family, foundation, and corporate clients, helping them to effectively and efficiently deploy philanthropic and investment capital for good. Those engagements have focused on organizational development, strategic planning, due diligence, program implementation, and evaluation of impact. Bruce has worked across a range of issues, including community development, human rights, education, and the environment. In addition to his work at Arabella, Bruce serves on the board of the Windward Fund—a 501(c)(3) fiscal sponsor and grant-making intermediary, the Morrison Family Foundation, and the Lilly School of Philanthropy. He is a former member of the board of Forefront, the Environmental Grantmakers Association, Opportunity International, and the Merit School of Music. Prior to joining Arabella, Bruce served for 13 years as a senior manager at The Nature Conservancy where he led the Illinois Program, the Upper Mississippi River Project, and the four-continent Great Rivers Partnership. Bruce started his career in law but left legal practice to buy a manufacturing company out of bankruptcy, which he ran and later sold to a Fortune 500 company. Bruce graduated magna cum laude from Middlebury College, earned his law degree from the University of Chicago, and studied business at Northwestern’s Kellogg School of Management.

We award every nonprofit that completes the Candid survey full credit for this Beacon, in recognition of their willingness to publicly share this information with the nonprofit and philanthropic communities. Although the data is not evaluated for quality at this time, future iterations of this Beacon will include third party or other data that will serve to validate the information provided by the nonprofit.Analysis and ResearchLike the overall Encompass Rating System, the Culture & Community Beacon is designed to evolve as metrics are developed and ready for integration. Our partnership with Feedback Labs and Guidestar by Candid, and other partners including Fund for Shared Insight, GlobalGiving, and Keystone Accountability, enables us to launch the first version of this beacon with Constituent Feedback information collected on Candid's site.Feedback practices have been shown to support better Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion outcomes, an essential area of assessment that we intend to further expand and develop in the future. Feedback Labs has documented several studies which indicate that beyond achieving organizational goals, nonprofits that are attentive and responsive to concerns and ideas raised by beneficiaries establish stronger relationships with the people they serve, promote greater equity, and empower constituents in ways that can help to ensure better long-term outcomes.

(January 2019) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Winrock International is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to increase economic opportunity, sustain natural resources, and protect the environment.[1] Based in Little Rock, Arkansas and Washington, D.C., Winrock is named for Winthrop Rockefeller, who served as the 37th governor of Arkansas.[2][3] History[edit] In 1953, Winthrop Rockefeller founded Winrock Enterprises and Winrock Farms in Morrilton, Arkansas.[4][5] Winrock Farms served as a model facility to test and demonstrate agricultural practices that other farmers could emulate.[6] After his death, Rockefeller's trustees created the Winrock International Livestock Research and Training Center.[7][8] In 1985, the center merged with two other Rockefeller organizations — the Agricultural Development Council (founded by John D. Rockefeller III) and the International Agricultural Development Service (founded by the Rockefeller Foundation).[9][10][11][12] The newly merged organization became known as Winrock International.[13][14] Initiatives[edit] Winrock's projects are focused on four main areas: agriculture,[15] economic development,[16][17] energy and environment,[18][19][20][21][22][23] and human and social capital.[24][25] More than 95% of the organization's funding comes from the U.S. government, primarily the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Winrock initiatives include: The American Carbon Registry, the first private, voluntary greenhouse-gas registry.[26][27][28] The Arkansas Regional Innovation Hub, a makerspace that provides facilities, technology, support and equipment for entrepreneurs, artists and makers.[29][30] Farmer-to-Farmer, a USAID-funded program that sends American agricultural experts to the developing world to provide technical assistance to farmers, agribusinesses, and other groups involved with food production.[31][32][33][34] Innovate Arkansas, a project funded by the Arkansas Economic Development Commission that helps the state's technology entrepreneurs move from the startup phase to commercial viability.[35][36] The Wallace Center, an initiative which convenes producers, businesses and consumers to build healthier food systems and develop regional food hubs.[37][38] References[edit] ^ Laurie, Mary.

Rodney Ferguson See Team President & CEO As President and CEO, Rodney Ferguson is responsible for the strategic, programmatic, financial and management operations of Winrock International, a $100 million nonprofit organization with over 1,000 employees in more than 40 countries. Ferguson ensures that Winrock fulfills its mission to empower the disadvantaged, increase economic opportunity and sustain natural resources through its 100-plus projects managed from offices in D.C., Arkansas, California, Kenya, the Philippines and project offices around the world. Before coming to Winrock, Ferguson worked for 20 years as one of the country’s leading consultants on communications and strategy for the nonprofit sector — most recently with Lipman Hearne, Inc., the largest marketing firm in the U.S. that exclusively serves nonprofits. There he helped the MacArthur Foundation manage its $15 million MacArthur Fellows — a.k.a. “genius” — awards portfolio. Ferguson also worked with other major foundations, service providers and philanthropic organizations, including the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the Pew Charitable Trusts, the National Children’s Medical Center, and with international aid and development projects in Iraq, Slovenia and Qatar. He assisted dozens of colleges and universities, including Seton Hall University and the State University of New York (SUNY), the nation’s largest state education system. There he helped develop and execute the SUNY strategic plan “The Power of SUNY” to leverage the $5 billion-a-year system’s economic development for the benefit of New York’s students and taxpayers. Born and raised in Alabama, Ferguson graduated summa cum laude from Birmingham Southern College. He attended the University of St. Andrews in Scotland as a Rotary Foundation International Scholar, and graduated from Harvard Kennedy School with a master’s in public policy. Ferguson is a frequent speaker and presenter on foreign policy, international development and nonprofit accountability. He recently spoke on the global impact of harnessing technology, science and policy at the Redlands Forum and on enhancing solar capabilities in Winrock project sites at USAID’s Global Innovation Week. He also convened leading stakeholders from the public, private and nonprofit worlds to discuss counter trafficking-in-persons and sustainable global food supply issues at recent Concordia Summits. Ferguson has served on a number of boards and is involved in many organizations that call attention to the importance of development aid, including USAID’s Global Development Lab and the National Good Food Network. He is a member of the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM) 2019 Advisory Committee, the Milken Institute Center for Public Health Advisory Board, the U.S. Global Leadership Council and a founding member of the Cuba Consortium.

Meanwhile the word “hygiene” does not include health automatically and is often tied to a lot of the stigma we are working hard to overcome.

The aim of the organisation is to ""achieve an equitable and sustainable healthy environment for all"".[1] WECF is a network of more than 150 women's and environmental organisations in 50 countries worldwide.[1] WECF also works on national, European, UN and international political levels with the aim to increase women's influence in political decision-making processes. Contents 1 Herstory 2 United Nations 3 Organisation 4 References Herstory[edit] WECF was officially registered as a foundation in 1994 in the Netherlands as Women in Europe for a Common Future. During the “Earth Summit” in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil 1992 women from the European region came together to create the network WECF. The staff from WECF Germany posing in front of the #munich4Europe statue as part of the ""make Europe sustainable for all"" campaign 2018. United Nations[edit] WECF has observer status with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations (ECOSOC) and is an official partner of the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP). WECF is also a member of the European Environment and Health Committee (EEHC). WECF at the 2012 UN Rio+20 summit on sustainable development More than 50,000 representatives of social movements and civil society organisations took to the streets in Rio de Janeiro in June 2012, to demonstrate against unfair and unsustainable economic policies. At the same time, 30,000 participants of the United Nations Rio+20 conference contributed to the document ""The Future We Want""[2] which set the path for the Sustainable Development Goals (replacing the Millennium Development Goals). WECF took a leading role in the 2012 Rio+20 conference, as co-facilitator of the Women’s Major Group,[3] one of the nine groups of civil society which have a space in the UN policy process, and are allotted speaking time and contribute to the proposed negotiation text. WECF's role was to facilitate the 300 organisations through virtual and face to face meetings, develop joint text proposals for the negotiation text, organise meetings with country negotiators, as well as organising events in which to present the priorities of women's organisations. Organisation[edit] The organisation was founded by Marie Kranendonk in 1994. Now WECF has five offices in the Netherlands, Germany, France, Switzerland and Georgia. WECF has a dual governance system. The formal supervision of the executive directors and their team is done by the Board of Trustees (BOT). Their role is to approve the annual plans, budgets and reports, and supervise the work of WECF's directors. WECF's partners also have a say in their governance, through the International Advisory Board (IAB). The IAB's role is to give strategic advice to WECF's BOT and directors.

WECF operates with branches in France, Germany, NL, Switzerland and Georgia. By striving for a just and sustainable world, WECF’s team has gained management, consulting and policy advocacy expertise – WECF designs, implements and monitors holistic solutions on the ground while influencing local, national and international policies. WECF participates in the negotiations of UNFCCC, Kyoto Protocol, UNEP GC and CSD, is co-founder and core member of the Women and Gender Constituency, is involved in climate and energy policy processes (EU Climate, EU Energy), works closely with CAN Europe and the EEB (European Environmental Bureau), CAN EECCA (Eastern Europe, Caucasus and Central Asia) as well as with national and local (non-) governmental bodies and communities. While advocating ambitious and fair policies and effective gender mainstreaming, our projects on the ground directly support the most vulnerable, particularly women. The energy projects promote participation in and access to decentralised renewable energy and energy efficiency solutions with the aim to combat (energy) poverty, improve health, push democratic processes and empower local people, particularly women to become energy leaders. This has been achieved with energy and gender trainings, energy and gender advisory services as well as gender mainstreaming in energy infrastructure and policies. Energy cooperative and citizen’s projects has been realised in Germany, Belgium, Caucasus, Eastern Europe, Turkey, Uganda and Morocco.Role in the project WECF will lead the Task 5.5. “Gender based analysis”, and, in general will contribute to ENTRANCES through aspects including in-depth understanding of men and women’s needs, social roles, behaviour and attitudes for the energy transition. It will carefully address gender dimension with various forms of social innovation, such as energy cooperatives, energy prosumers, new business and service models, studying gender differences in energy access, the energy labour market, energy-related education, existing energy programs and in decision-making. WECF will be involved in planning and implementation of all project measures in a gender sensitive way: including gender impact assessment for activities, gender trainings, gender indicators and budgeting. Gender-instruments such as gender-budget, leadership trainings for women, and quota will be devised to ensure a gender inclusive and just approach.

BOX 176 237 Kearny St, San Francisco CA 94108, USA Description Women Organizing for Change in Agriculture and Natural Resource Management (WOCAN) is a women-led international membership network of women and men professionals and women's associations. WOCAN established in 2004 with 1100+ members in 109 countries aims to address three major gaps that emerge from the knowledge and experiences of sustainable and rural development processes. These are: 1. policies regarding gender within the agriculture and natural resource management sectors, 2. roles of professional women in implementing policy objectives for rural women’s empowerment and gender equality within these sectors, and 3. organizational barriers that obstruct women from realizing positions of leadership and influence to take on such roles. WOCAN's vision is of a world where gender equality has been achieved within agriculture and natural resource management organizations, policies, programs, markets and communities to achieved food security and sustainable development. WOCAN's overarching purpose is to advance women’s empowerment and collective action to tackle climate change, poverty and food insecurity within enabling environments.

Please see all of our photos, live streams, and videos from our time at COP25 on our Facebook Page. WECAN International was very honored to facilitate the presence of an incredible delegation of frontline women leaders at COP25, who advocated for climate justice and led and participated in powerful actions and events over the duration of their time in Madrid. The WECAN delegation included: Casey Camp-Horinek (Ponca Nation, Turtle Island, USA), Ponca Nation councilwoman, long-time Native rights activist, environmentalist and actress; Sônia Bone Guajajara (Brazilian Amazon) Executive Coordinator for the Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil (APIB); Daiara Tukano (Brazilian Amazon), Indigenous activist, artist, and coordinator of Radio Yandê; Nina Gualinga (Ecuadorian Amazon), Indigenous woman leader and co-founder of HAKU Amazon Design; Helena Gualinga (Ecuadorian Amazon), 17-year-old Indigenous social activist; along with Osprey Orielle Lake (USA), Executive Director of WECAN International; and Katherine Quaid (Confederated Tribes of Umatilla, Turtle Island, USA), Communications Coordinator for WECAN International.

Photo via WECAN International - Katherine QuaidTwo Key Outcomes From The COP25 NegotiationsGender Action Plan In the midst of much stagnation in the negotiations, there was a shining light — a victory for the Gender Action Plan. The dedication of ceaseless work by the Women and Gender Constituency, feminists advocating at the Party level, and frontline constituencies proved powerful as the Gender Action Plan (GAP) was formally adopted by the Parties, with the inclusion of rights-based language. We have deep gratitude for all the gender equity advocates and the Women and Gender Constituency who have worked tirelessly to ensure gender justice within the COP. After years of negotiations, the Gender Action Plan is an important success that will offer some sorely needed leverage for human rights in the Paris Climate Agreement. ​ WECAN commends this outcome, recognizing the necessity for a rights-based approach to be included at all levels of climate action policy. We will be monitoring the GAP because for it to truly be effective, the GAP must coincide with progressive climate financing, support Indigenous and human rights and biodiversity, and bolster worldwide women’s movements at the grassroots, local, and national level. ​ Article 6 of the Paris Climate Agreement Article 6 of the Paris Climate Agreement is concerned with how countries are to mitigate and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by operationalizing market and non-market based solutions. Yet, Parties only chose to focus on creating and establishing market-based mechanisms for reducing emissions, including carbon markets, REDD+, carbon offsets, and cap-and-trade programs. Throughout the week, Indigenous and frontline communities and civil society organizations led and organized several Article 6 demonstrations, you can watch the videos of the actions here and here. Ultimately negotiators were unable to agree upon an outcome for Article 6, and thus it remains in limbo. In this instance, no deal is better than any deal as we do not want any Articles that enable counterproductive carbon markets and do not ensure safeguards for Indigenous rights, human rights, gender justice, and ecological integrity. As in the case of the Article 6, it is vital in these negotiations for our voice as civil society to be at the COP to advocate and influence the process, and to interfere with mechanisms that will further predator capitalism, which has caused the socio-ecological crisis in the first place.Powerful Women leaders speak at WECAN International’s formal United Nations Side Event, “Women for Climate Justice Leading Solutions on the Frontlines of Climate Change”Women leaders share their struggles and solutions during WECAN’s formal UN side event, ‘‘Women for Climate Justice Leading Solutions on the Frontlines of Climate Change” on December 11, 2019.

Global Launch Of ‘Women Speak: Stories, Case Studies And Solutions From The Frontlines Of Climate ChangeOn November 1, 2017 - the Women’s Earth and Climate Action Network celebrated the international launch of  ‘Women Speak: Stories, Case Studies And Solutions From The Frontlines Of Climate Change’, a web-based research database and initiative designed to shift the narrative and challenge dominant systems of exploitation and oppression of women and the Earth, through the collection and sharing of stories by and about women leading struggles and solutions for climate justice under a variety of cross-sectional themes.In the lead-up to Bonn COP23 and throughout the 2 weeks of the climate talks, WECAN International highlighted the project through all events and media engagements - leveraging the platform as a critical tool to affect policy and socio-ecological changes.COP23 Rights of Nature AdvocacyMirian Cisneros, President of the Kichwa Pueblo of Sarayaku, presents during the International Rights of Nature Tribunal - BonnOver the course of COP23, WECAN International was thrilled to be engaged as a member of the Executive Steering Committee of the Global Alliance for the Rights of Nature, in organizing and presenting a series of important events both inside and outside of COP23. ​ Over a series of two days, the 4th International Rights of Nature Tribunal was held as a public event in downtown Bonn, featuring international Rights of Nature advocates, and frontline and Indigenous leaders, who presented and tried a series of cases involving violations of Earth rights, Indigenous rights, and community rights around the globe. ​ Inside of the UNFCCC process, WECAN Executive Director, Osprey Orielle Lake, and other Alliance representatives presented an official press conference, ‘Report Back from the Rights of Nature Tribunal in Bonn: Foundations for Systemic Change in Climate Solutions’. ​ The Women's Earth and Climate Action Network, Movements Rights and Indigenous Environmental Network also released a vital new report, 'Rights of Nature and Mother Earth: Rights-Based Law for Systemic Change'.COP23 DemonstrationsMembers and allies of the Women and Gender Constituency hold an action to highlight violence against women defenders of the land at COP23 WECAN International Delegates participate with global allies in a direct-action to call-out false solutions from the Trump Administration at COP23Like every COP climate conference - COP23 in Bonn was full of important creative demonstrations planned by coalitions of civil society organizations and individuals.

To pursue expansion of the mine, 90% of the forest, an ancient and unique ecosystem, and one of the last mixed forests in Central Europe, has already been cut. ​ For the past five years, a brave group of activists and Earth defenders have been peacefully occupying the remaining forest on the edge of the mine - setting up tree houses and a year-round encampment. WECAN was honored to visit with and interview some of the women of the Hambacher occupation to learn more about why they stand for the forest, and their visions for systemic change and climate justice. Watch and share:In the time since WECAN International visited the Hambach Forest, the camp has faced various new challenges, court cases, and police evictions.

Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.Find sources: ""Women's Environment & Development Organization"" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR (April 2021) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The Women's Environment & Development Organization (WEDO) is an international non-governmental organization based in New York City, U.S. that advocates women’s equality in global policy. Its early successes included achieving gender equality in the final documents of Agenda 21 and the Rio Declaration. In 2006, the organization was named as an international Champion of the Earth by the United Nations Environment Programme. The Women’s Environment and Development Organization (WEDO), was founded in 1990 by two influential women, former United States Congresswoman Bella Abzug and Mim Kelber who was a feminist activist. Several pioneers have also contributed to the development of this organization such as Thais Corral, Jocelyn Dow, Wangari Maathai, Brownie Ledbetter, Chief Bisi Ogunleye, and Vandana Shiva. The organization fights for women’s rights on an international level through a series of worldwide conferences and actions. WEDO plays an important role in promoting justice by strengthening global and local advocacy systems. The organization includes a Technical Advisor, an Advocate, Facilitator and Convener, Trainer, Organizer, and Knowledge Creator. All these roles help in advocating for women’s human rights by advising, analyzing, and leading a set of several actions to let government and United Nations agencies understand the importance of the implementation of development policies for women across the world. The organization focuses on six key areas; Climate Policy, Sustainable Cities & Transport, Disaster Risk Reduction, Biodiversity, Peace, Conflict, & Natural Resources, and International Finance & Trade. The organization has also developed the Gender Climate Tracker App. The app allows users to access any information, policies, and laws governments from around the world have established on climate change. The app was created following the Paris Climate Agreement in collaboration with the governments of Finland and Switzerland, as well as Global Gender and Climate Alliance (GGCA). The organization hopes that users will take advantage of the app by using it to keep governments and officials accountable for following through on any commitments made. The Women’s Environment and Development Organization also started the “Feminist Agenda for a Green New Deal” with 13 other partners. The coalition analyzes how feminist principles on intersectional gender inequality cross-cut with climate change in order to try to establish a healthier planet in the future. The website states that a Green New Deal must be guided by principles of justice and accountability, as well as listing principles for action. WEDO and the Center for Women's Global Leadership launched the Gender Equality Architecture Reform (GEAR) Campaign in February 2008 to mobilize women’s groups and allies to push for the adoption of the new UN entity for gender equality and women’s empowerment.[1] Priority projects include MisFortune500.org, climate change advocacy, and UN Reform.

WILPF’s theory of change is that by addressing the root causes of violence with a feminist lens and by mobilizing for nonviolent approaches to security and justice, WILPF can contribute to feminist peace for equality, justice, and demilitarized security. WILPF believes that feminist peace requires breaking down of silos that exist by advocating for the inclusion of a gender analysis into policy and by decision-makers and institutions at all levels. Jane Addams founded WILPF along with 1,200 women who came together in The Hague during the First World War in 1915. The organization’s first president, Addams was the first American woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize, which she received in 1931. The Jane Addams Peace Association (JAPA), the 501(c)3 educational affiliate of WILPF U.S., was founded in 1948 “to foster a better understanding between the people of the world toward the end that wars may be avoided and a more lasting peace enjoyed.” WILPF is the oldest women’s peace organization in the world. WILPF NEWS: Channel Grants: 2015-2020: Channel made annual grants to Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom International (WILPF) to support their Human Rights Program, particularly the strengthening of their African sections and their participation in the organization’s international human rights advocacy work. A list of all current and emerging WILPF Sections can be found here. As an organization, WILPF has long emphasized local and regional leadership within its Country Sections at the same time that it has demonstrated the power of a global network. For many years WILPF has been steadily growing its network in Africa helped in part by the remarkable leadership of women like Joy Ada Onyesoh who was named International President of WILPF in 2018 and who has been active in WILPF since 2007. Since 2018, the organization has been growing by leaps and bounds in Africa. Four new African sections of WILPF were approved at the organization’s 32nd International Triennial Congress in Ghana:  WILPF Chad, WILPF Kenya, WILPF Zimbabwe, and WILPF Uganda in addition to WILPF Afghanistan. And news chapters have emerged since then. Prior to the 2018 Triennial, WILPF hosted a forum on the Feminist Peace Movement in Africa at the University of Ghana in Accra.  The forum aimed to bring together peace activists from across Africa and globally to create a space in which to mobilize feminist solidarity for strong and innovative non-violent work in Africa.  Other conversations included looking at the synergies between African and Global feminist peace movements and also included a particular focus on mediation efforts and peace process. The excitement of the meeting was captured in these videos. In 2019 and 2020, Channel funds were used to support further advocacy and engagement opportunities such as those presented by the UN Human Rights Council, CEDAW, The Universal Periodic Review process, country review by UN Human Rights treaty bodies, and many more. Over the next two years, WILPF plans to engage its activists from places like Kenya, Burkina Faso, Niger, Central African Republic, Cote d’Ivoire, Zimbabwe, Uganda, Cameroon and the DRC. 2014: Channel made a grant to WILPF to support their 100th Anniversary Event in The Hague in April 2015 and their Women’s Power to Stop War Campaign. 2013: Channel made a grant to WILPF to support the Women’s Power to Stop War campaign, the “global movement of WILPF aimed at celebrating a century of peacemaking from a gender perspective.” 2012: Channel made a grant to WILPF to support a planning and capacity building process around WILPF’s 100th anniversary campaign, “Women and Peace 2015.” As the oldest women’s peace organization in the world, WILPF marked its centennial in 2015 and undertook to create a new security agenda and to get the attention of decision-makers as well as women’s grassroots movements about the need for greater connection between women’s security, human rights, development and disarmament. The campaign helped to build capacity and strengthen WILPF sections particularly those in the Global South and/or conflict areas (Albania, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, DRC, French Polynesia, India, Israel, Lebanon, Mexico, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Palestine, Peru, Philippines, and Sri Lanka) as they carried out the launch of the campaign in their own local and national contexts. 2011: Channel made a grant to the Jane Addams Peace Association (JAPA) to support public education through a series of civil society consultations concerning the creation of a U.S. National Action Plan on Security Council Resolution 1325 (SCR1325) conducted by its affiliate, the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF) U.S. or WILPF-US, in five cities in September and October 2011. The purpose of the gatherings was to bring women and allies to the table to collectively voice their concerns and have an impact on the implementation of the US National Action Plan on SCR1325. These meetings were intended to inform the public and help disseminate information on SCR1325; to publicize the issue through the media; and to help convene local leaders and connect them with national policymakers. See the Impact section below for more. Resources: The Women’s Power to Stop War Anniversary Atlas, launched in May 2014, is an interactive timeline created by WILPF that enables people to view the dynamic past, present and future activities of women peacemakers through a global lens. Most importantly, it is the first time that the work of women peacemakers comes together to clearly demonstrate what the collective strength of women’s power to stop war looks like on a global scale through a fun and accessible online forum. The Atlas is an ongoing project facilitated by WILPF, where all peacemakers are able to add past and future events to the Atlas to put women’s power to stop war on the map once and for all. The Atlas is part of the global Anniversary movement of WILPF, Women’s Power to Stop War which connects, strengthens and celebrates the work of women peacemakers from all around the world and culminated at the major international conference on Disarmament, Gender and Peace of the century. On Dec. 10, 2013 WILPF announced the launch of PeaceWomen’s new, expanded and revised mobile application on Women, Peace and Security. This app allows you to access updated information on the Women Peace and Security (WPS) agenda from anywhere and everywhere. Although it fits in the palm of your hand, this app acts as a powerful tool to monitor the international community’s progress on integrating gender into its laws and policies. By providing up-to-date information into app users’ hands, WILPF hopes to empower activists at all levels. On March 8, 2013 WILPF launched the Women’s Power to Stop War campaign in preparation for their 100th anniversary. 1,136 visionary women came together to participate in the second women’s peace and security conference of a century in April 26-29, 2015, in the World Forum in the Hague where 1,136 women came together to stop WWI in 1915. Impact: The WILPF-US consultations in five cities across the U.S. in 2011 resulted in 64 Recommendations for implementation of UN SCR 1325 in the NAP, arising from what women in the U.S. articulated as constituting peace and security from a “human security” perspective. On Dec. 19, 2011, President Barack Obama released the first-ever U.S. National Action Plan (NAP) on Women, Peace, and Security, complete with an accompanying fact sheet and Executive Order directing the plan to be implemented. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s announcement about the U.S. NAP and accompanying video can be viewed here. In conjunction with these historic events, WILPF-U.S. launched its Final Report of the Civil Society Consultations on the Development of the U.S. National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security with the U.S. State Department.

Olmstead, who just made an expensive trip through the West and Middle West speaking on the need for peace"" WILPF developed out of the International Women's Congress against World War I that took place in The Hague, Netherlands, in 1915 and the formation of the International Women's Committee of Permanent Peace;[1] the name WILPF was not chosen until 1919.[2][3] The first WILPF president, Jane Addams, had previously founded the Woman's Peace Party in the United States, in January 1915, this group later became the US section of WILPF.[4] Along with Jane Addams, Marian Cripps and Margaret E. Dungan were also founding members. The British Maude Royden remained vice president of the international WILPF.[5] As of 1920 the US section of WILPF was headquartered in New York City.[6] Marian Cripps, Baroness Parmoor, who later served as president of its British branch.[7][8] Furthermore, the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom is opposed to wars and international conflicts. The major movements of the league have been: open letter to UN secretary general to formally end the Korean War, a statement on weapons and an international day for the total elimination of nuclear weapons, gender-based violence and women human rights defenders. Woman's Peace Party (USA)[edit] Main article: Woman's Peace Party A forerunner to the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, the Woman's Peace Party (WPP) was formed in January, 1915 in Washington, D.C. at a meeting called by Jane Addams and Carrie Chapman Catt. The approximately 3,000 women attendees approved a platform calling for the extension of suffrage to women and for a conference of neutral countries to offer continuous mediation as a way of ending war. WPP sent representatives to a subsequent International Women's Congress for Peace and Freedom, held in The Hague from April 28–30, 1915. International Congress of Women, The Hague, 1915[edit] The 1915 International Congress of Women was organized by the German feminist Anita Augspurg, Germany's first female jurist, and Lida Gustava Heymann (1868–1943) at the invitation of the Dutch pacifist, feminist and suffragist Aletta Jacobs to protest the war then raging in Europe, and to suggest ways to prevent war in the future. The Congress opened on April 28,[9] wound up on May 1,[1] and was attended by 1,136 participants from both neutral and belligerent nations,[10] adopted much of the platform of WPP and established an International Committee of Women for Permanent Peace (ICWPP) with Jane Addams as president. WPP soon became the US Section of ICWPP. Second International Women's Congress for Peace and Freedom, Zürich, 1919[edit] Jane Addams met with President Woodrow Wilson and is said to have worked out some common ground on peace. However, at their second international congress, held in Zürich in 1919, ICWPP denounced the final terms of the peace treaty ending World War I as a scheme of revenge of the victors over the vanquished that would sow the seeds of another world war. They decided to make their committee permanent and renamed it the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom.[4] WILPF moved its headquarters to Geneva to be near the proposed site of the League of Nations, although WILPF did not endorse empowering that organization to conduct food blockades or to use military pressure to enforce its resolutions. The League called for international disarmament and an end to economic imperialism.[4] The US branch of WILPF grew in recognition and membership during the post-WWI era, despite some attacks on the organisation as ""unpatriotic"" during the First Red Scare.[4] The WILPF supported treaties such as the Washington Naval Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, regarding them as stepping stones to a peaceful world order.[4] During the 1930s, Vera Brittain was the WILPF's Vice-President.[11] Prior to the outbreak of World War Two, the League also supported measures to provide relief for Europe's Jewish community.[4] Although WIPLF membership is restricted to women, several male peace activists have contributed to WIPLF meetings and publications, including Bart de Ligt[12] and J. D. Bernal.[13] Two WILPF leaders have received the Nobel Peace Prize for their peace efforts and international outlook and work with WILPF: Jane Addams, in 1931 and Emily Greene Balch in 1946.[14] WILPF and the United Nations[edit] WILPF has had Consultative Status (category B) with the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) since 1948 and has Special Consultative Relations with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), as well as special relations with the International Labour Organization (ILO), Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and other organizations and agencies. WILPF has advocates and lobbies for the democratization of the UN, the Security Council and all other UN organizations and agencies; monitors Security Council and General Assembly activities in order to promote reforms; opposes the privatisation and corporatisation of the UN, especially the global compact with corporations; and advocates for the abolition of the Security Council veto. WILPF today[edit] Mission and vision[edit] Work areas Building the movement Redefining security Leveraging feminist perspectives on peace Promoting socio-economic justice [15] Broad areas of concern are: Global programs Human Rights Programme Women, Peace and Security Programme Disarmament Programme Crisis Response Programme [16] PeaceWomen[edit] The Women in Peace and Security Programme, WIPSEN, or ""PeaceWomen"" was founded in 2000.

DunganTypeNGOHeadquartersGeneva The Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF) is a non-profit non-governmental organization working ""to bring together women of different political views and philosophical and religious backgrounds determined to study and make known the causes of war and work for a permanent peace"" and to unite women worldwide who oppose oppression and exploitation. WILPF has national sections in 37 countries. The WILPF is headquartered in Geneva and maintains a United Nations office in New York City.

Olmstead, who just made an expensive trip through the West and Middle West speaking on the need for peace"" WILPF developed out of the International Women's Congress against World War I that took place in The Hague, Netherlands, in 1915 and the formation of the International Women's Committee of Permanent Peace;[1] the name WILPF was not chosen until 1919.[2][3] The first WILPF president, Jane Addams, had previously founded the Woman's Peace Party in the United States, in January 1915, this group later became the US section of WILPF.[4] Along with Jane Addams, Marian Cripps and Margaret E. Dungan were also founding members. The British Maude Royden remained vice president of the international WILPF.[5] As of 1920 the US section of WILPF was headquartered in New York City.[6] Marian Cripps, Baroness Parmoor, who later served as president of its British branch.[7][8] Furthermore, the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom is opposed to wars and international conflicts. The major movements of the league have been: open letter to UN secretary general to formally end the Korean War, a statement on weapons and an international day for the total elimination of nuclear weapons, gender-based violence and women human rights defenders. Woman's Peace Party (USA)[edit] Main article: Woman's Peace Party A forerunner to the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, the Woman's Peace Party (WPP) was formed in January, 1915 in Washington, D.C. at a meeting called by Jane Addams and Carrie Chapman Catt. The approximately 3,000 women attendees approved a platform calling for the extension of suffrage to women and for a conference of neutral countries to offer continuous mediation as a way of ending war. WPP sent representatives to a subsequent International Women's Congress for Peace and Freedom, held in The Hague from April 28–30, 1915. International Congress of Women, The Hague, 1915[edit] The 1915 International Congress of Women was organized by the German feminist Anita Augspurg, Germany's first female jurist, and Lida Gustava Heymann (1868–1943) at the invitation of the Dutch pacifist, feminist and suffragist Aletta Jacobs to protest the war then raging in Europe, and to suggest ways to prevent war in the future. The Congress opened on April 28,[9] wound up on May 1,[1] and was attended by 1,136 participants from both neutral and belligerent nations,[10] adopted much of the platform of WPP and established an International Committee of Women for Permanent Peace (ICWPP) with Jane Addams as president. WPP soon became the US Section of ICWPP. Second International Women's Congress for Peace and Freedom, Zürich, 1919[edit] Jane Addams met with President Woodrow Wilson and is said to have worked out some common ground on peace. However, at their second international congress, held in Zürich in 1919, ICWPP denounced the final terms of the peace treaty ending World War I as a scheme of revenge of the victors over the vanquished that would sow the seeds of another world war. They decided to make their committee permanent and renamed it the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom.[4] WILPF moved its headquarters to Geneva to be near the proposed site of the League of Nations, although WILPF did not endorse empowering that organization to conduct food blockades or to use military pressure to enforce its resolutions. The League called for international disarmament and an end to economic imperialism.[4] The US branch of WILPF grew in recognition and membership during the post-WWI era, despite some attacks on the organisation as ""unpatriotic"" during the First Red Scare.[4] The WILPF supported treaties such as the Washington Naval Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, regarding them as stepping stones to a peaceful world order.[4] During the 1930s, Vera Brittain was the WILPF's Vice-President.[11] Prior to the outbreak of World War Two, the League also supported measures to provide relief for Europe's Jewish community.[4] Although WIPLF membership is restricted to women, several male peace activists have contributed to WIPLF meetings and publications, including Bart de Ligt[12] and J. D. Bernal.[13] Two WILPF leaders have received the Nobel Peace Prize for their peace efforts and international outlook and work with WILPF: Jane Addams, in 1931 and Emily Greene Balch in 1946.[14] WILPF and the United Nations[edit] WILPF has had Consultative Status (category B) with the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) since 1948 and has Special Consultative Relations with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), as well as special relations with the International Labour Organization (ILO), Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and other organizations and agencies. WILPF has advocates and lobbies for the democratization of the UN, the Security Council and all other UN organizations and agencies; monitors Security Council and General Assembly activities in order to promote reforms; opposes the privatisation and corporatisation of the UN, especially the global compact with corporations; and advocates for the abolition of the Security Council veto. WILPF today[edit] Mission and vision[edit] Work areas Building the movement Redefining security Leveraging feminist perspectives on peace Promoting socio-economic justice [15] Broad areas of concern are: Global programs Human Rights Programme Women, Peace and Security Programme Disarmament Programme Crisis Response Programme [16] PeaceWomen[edit] The Women in Peace and Security Programme, WIPSEN, or ""PeaceWomen"" was founded in 2000. It monitors the UN's work in field of women, peace and security, taken part in advocacy and outreach.[17][18] WIPSEN-Africa, was founded in 2006 by Liberian activist Leymah Gbowee, Nigerian activist Thelma Ekiyor, and Ecoma Bassey Alaga, and is based in Ghana.[19][20][21] Famous Members[edit] WILPF's list of members include Jane Addams, Aletta Jacobs, Alice Walker,[22] Coretta Scott King,[23] Madeleine Rees, Madeleine Zabriskie Doty, Cornelia Ramondt-Hirschmann, Selma Meyer, Brandy G.

Its goal is to be the global youth empowerment organisation: empowering, inspiring and mobilising young people to find and share their voice on the issues that matter to them and to the world. YMCA helps young people to better themselves, to better their communities, and to better their world. It gives them the Space to bring about Transformation in themselves and their communities, and make a positive difference – an Impact – as a result. Founded in London in 1844 as the Young Men’s Christian Association, YMCA has grown to reach over 60 million people a year across 120 countries. Founded as a safe space for young Christian men, YMCA now welcomes men and women of any or no faith, of any race or background.  With nearly 90,000 staff, some 920,000 volunteers and 12,000 branches worldwide, its work embraces young and old. YMCA empowers young people While associated with many things – including affordable accommodation for the vulnerable; the invention of basketball and the role of ‘gym and swim’; even a 1970s disco song and its accompanying dance moves – the Movement is above all about one thing: youth empowerment. Youth empowerment means equipping young people to play active roles in shaping their societies. It also means ‘youth-led solutions’.  YMCA provides the space – and critical expertise, and seed funding – for young people to lead the way in addressing the challenges of the world they are inheriting. This marks a fundamental shift in YMCA’s approach, from providing services to young people, to empowering young people to provide solutions themselves. YMCA works in four main areas The YMCA Movement empowers youth to stand up and be agents of change in four main areas, deriving from research carried out by YMCA among young people, and formally agreed by the YMCA World Council in Colorado, USA, in 2014. about-us Health – ‘Nurturing the young in body, mind and spirit’ YMCA is committed to helping young people overcome barriers to accessing quality health education.  It provides services to improve their wellbeing in body, mind and spirit. Over 90 National YMCAs worldwide are working in health-related issues. YMCA worldwide runs over 117,000 programmes on health-related issues, involving and reaching nearly 16.9 million people (Data: 2018). Environment – ‘Channelling young people’s commitment to climate justice and substainability’ YMCA is committed to advancing global conservation and responsibility to reduce the effects of climate change through youth-led education programmes and advocacy initiatives that improve environmental awareness. 70 national YMCAs worldwide are working on environment-related issues. YMCA worldwide runs 2,400 programmes on environment-related issues, involving and reaching some 232,000 people (Data: 2018). Civic engagement – ‘Amplifying youth voices and actions in communities’ YMCA is committed to providing platforms for young people to lead change in their communities through civic action and advocacy, gender equality, youth justice and leadership development. 88 national YMCAs worldwide are working on civic engagement-related issues. YMCA worldwide runs nearly 7,400 programmes on issues related to civic engagement, involving and reaching over 280,000 people (Data: 2018). Employment – ‘Preparing young people for decent jobs and sustainable livelihoods’ YMCA is committed to providing quality education, vocational training, and opportunities to young people to ensure they have the experience and knowledge needed to succeed in today’s work environment. Some 75 National YMCAs worldwide are working in employment related issues. YMCA worldwide runs nearly 5,000 programmes on employment related issues, involving and reaching almost 516,000 people (Data: 2018). Two themes run through each of these priority action areas. First, the quest for Inclusion.  YMCA is committed to ensuring that young people have a safe space to belong, contribute and thrive in their local community, regardless of where they come from, who they love or how they worship. And second, support for Migrants and Refugees. YMCA supports the wellbeing and integration of migrants and refugees into the societies in which they seek to build a new life. YMCA navigates COVID-19 and beyond – we follow our ‘North Star’ In 2020-2021, the entire YMCA Movement was hit hard by the Coronavirus pandemic, with its business model – built around young people meeting in person – severely disrupted. Worse, young people themselves were disproportionately affected by the pandemic, with their jobs and job prospects, their education, their friendships and community living, and above all their mental health heavily affected. And yet young people have also stepped up as first responders in their communities, supporting the vulnerable. COVID has been and remains an accelerator of change, and of opportunity.  It has led the YMCA Movement on a path through Resilience and Recovery, to ‘Reimagination’ for the 21st Century, as it agrees its collective roadmap for the next ten years – its Vision 2030 – in helping the world to meet the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, and for the next 20 years, as it approaches its bicentenary in 2044. The YMCA’s ‘North Star’ is undimmed: as the global youth empowerment organisation, it will continue to empower, inspire and mobilise young people to ‘be the change they want to see’. The World Alliance of YMCAs The World Alliance of YMCAs (World YMCA) was founded in 1855, the year that 99 delegates from nine countries met in Paris and agreed the Paris Basis, the global YMCA’s founding charter. The Paris Basis has been developed and enriched over the years, notably by the Kampala Principles of 1973, and Challenge 21 of 1998. The organisation has grown, embracing more people and doing more things. Based in Geneva, Switzerland since 1878, World YMCA represents and supports 120 national YMCA Movements and four YMCA Area Alliances across the globe (Africa, Asia Pacific, Europe, Latin America & Caribbean – América Latina y el Caribe) and three Regions (Canada, USA, Middle East).  Its Secretary-General Carlos Sanvee (2018-) leads a team based in Geneva as well as Africa, Europe, South America and the US.  World YMCA is governed by an Executive Committee under its President Patricia Pelton (2018-), and its highest decision-making body is the four-yearly YMCA World Council. World YMCA strengthens the capacity of National YMCA movements to respond to social issues; it advocates globally on issues affecting young people; it represents YMCA at the global level and partners with key stakeholders, United Nations bodies, ecumenical bodies and other civil society organisations; and it coordinates YMCA emergency response efforts. Its Change Agents youth leadership programme has trained nearly 800 youth leaders since 2012, and its Youth Led Solutions Initiative has explored the worlds of climate action, jobs and wellbeing through the lens of young people, launching projects worldwide. It works in close partnership with other global and local youth organisations, UN agencies and governments, and increasingly businesses. As one of the world’s ‘Big 6’ youth organisations*, it is a founding member and leading light in the Global Youth Mobilization. World YMCA’s 2021-2022 Strategy is built around the three pillars of enhancing collective YMCA impact on young people to unlock youth-led solutions, supporting journeying together as one worldwide YMCA Movement, and supporting worldwide Movement financial sustainability.

That was our purpose, and it continues to be the principal objective of all affiliated clubs. The YMCA (Young Men’s Christian Association) is one of the oldest and largest movements for youth in the world and works to bring social justice and peace to young people and their communities, regardless of religion, race, gender or culture. Founded on June 6, 1844 in London, England by George Williams, the goal of the organisation was putting Christian principles into practice, achieved by developing “a healthy spirit, mind, and body.” The World Alliance of YMCAs, based in Geneva, Switzerland, is a confederation of National Councils of YMCAs around the world. It now supports and facilitates some 120 national YMCAs and four regional Alliances across the globe, to provide young people with safe spaces and opportunities to take an active role in transforming their communities. Collectively, the YMCA Movement reaches some 65 million people a year. How It All Began The era of the “Roaring Twenties” post-World War I, known as a time of excess and unprecedented progress, was also conversely an incubator for increased civic awareness and accountability. With the awakening of the social conscious came the rise of the modern service organisation. Within the Toledo YMCA, a young programme director, noticing an increase in both time and monetary donations to the YMCA, identified 15 young businessmen working within the YMCA as volunteers and two staff members to start a service club to support actively, extraneously and in new ways the work of the YMCA. In 1920, the Tolymca luncheon club was formed under the direction of young lawyer, Paul William Alexander. By November 1922, word of the initiative had spread to other YMCAs in the USA and 17 clubs existed. The  International Association of Y’s Men’s Clubs was officially founded, in Alexander’s words, “of and for the YMCA”. Plaque commemorating the first club (Toledo, Ohio, USA) Founder Paul William Alexander (far left) and other members of the first Y’s Men’s Club, circa 1922. Separate Yet Together The association (familiarly known as Y’s Men International) and its clubs, officially separate from the YMCA with its own constitution and officers, gradually began to engage in independent projects. Their activities, while still mindful and respectful of the YMCA’s mission, were no longer directly connected or controlled by any specific branch or national movement. Clubs without any direct connection to the YMCA started to be formed. But the intention always remained that the activity of these clubs was to be representative and supportive of the YMCA’s goals and agenda. Ideally, Y’s Men clubs chartered without an associated YMCA would strive to bring a YMCA branch to their community, and clubs founded where there were YMCAs would have a YMCA “secretary” as a member or an appointed YMCA liaison to build cooperation. In various places, YMCA Secretary remains an active position on the roster of club officers. The Liaisons WAL and YL Partnership Agreements World YMCA Liaison (WAL) Agustin Garcia Bolanos Cacho from Mexico (left) is pictured with YMI Liaison (YL) Kohei Yamada from Japan. The position of an international YMI liaison to the World YMCA (YL) was recognised in the 1970s and details of the appointment refined by International Council in 1978 in an attempt to rekindle the connection between the two organisations. In 1975, a formal Memorandum of Understanding between World Alliance of YMCAs and Y’s Men International was drafted and renewed annually per Council approval until 1995 when Y’s Men moved out of the World YMCA building into its own offices. In 1981, the first Principles of Partnership (POP) was signed at the international level, and YMI extended an official invitation for a YMCA representative (WAL) to attend its annual legislative meeting. In 1998 the World YMCA amended its constitution to recognise the Y’s Men’s Liaison as an official member of the World Alliance Executive Committee without vote. It has become practice for each new International Secretary General to renew the partnership agreement. In August 2020, World Alliance SG Carlos Sanvee and Y’s Men International ISG Jose Varghese honoured this tradition by resigning the POP, once again continuing the allegiance.

Guideline 304 of our International Constitution states: In order to maintain an active relationship with the World Alliance of YMCAs and its national components, there shall be a direct liaison between (1) the International Association of Y’s Men’s Clubs office and the office of the World Alliance of YMCAs and (2) the Regions of Y’s Men International located within a particular country and the national YMCA movement, or its sub-sections, of that country. ARE YOU A SINGLE COUNTRY REGION? DO YOU HAVE AN APPOINTED YMCA LIAISON? Key Areas of Collaboration Despite its independent status, YMI has consistently safeguarded its founding promise to support the YMCA. Alexander Scholarship Fund In 1954, the Paul William Alexander Scholarship Fund was created to subsidise the training of YMCA present and prospective staff. (The name was shortened to the Alexander Scholarship Fund in 1982.) The majority of support is decided and implemented by the Regions and Areas in order to have relevant and direct impact locally. As of 2020/21, 30% of ASF contributions are sent to IHQ for use in more comprehensive initiatives. Change Agents In recent years, international funds have been used to subsidise the formation of YMCA Change Agents, young YMCA staff or volunteers following a specific leadership development programme to become empowered as change makers in their own communities. YMCA 175 Support In 2019, we sponsored two key-note speakers at the YMCA 175 event in London. COVID-19 Solidarity Fund In 2020, we donated CHF 10 000 to the YMCA’s COVID-19 Solidarity Fund created to provide institutional  grants to National Movements struggling and at risk of permanent closure due to the pandemic, helping to pay administrative and staff costs. Time of Fast The Time of Fast programme of YMI was initially created as a way to support YMCA projects aligning with the priorities of YMI’s Human Crisis Committee, which existed at that time to address, poverty, racial discrimination, denial of basic human rights, etc. The first fasting event took place in December 1970 and the almost USD 4 000 raised was donated to the World YMCA for its refugee camps. Today YMI clubs, YMCA and official YMCA affiliates may apply for TOF funding. An optimal project is one in which there is clear and active cooperation between the two organisations in the implementation of the activities. Every applicant is encouraged to establish a contract of collaboration or memorandum of understanding. Read More Celebrating 100 Years of Partnership We encourage you to read the summary of the YMI/YMCA relationship that IHQ has developed to honour the partnership of our two organisations in order to refresh your memory, perhaps learn new facts but most importantly to gain an understanding of where we are today and where we are headed.

The report is the 5th in the series of reports focussing on bioenergy developments from around the world. Download here Summary Fossil fuels dominate our energy mix and the dependence continued in recent years. During 2016 – 2017, the primary energy supply of fossil fuels has increased more than the supply of renewable energy sources. The 1.5% increase in total primary energy supply during 2016 – 17 has been matched by coal, oil and natural gas while renewables are lagging behind (0.7%). This trend appears to continue to 2018 and 2019 as well. In 2017, the gross final energy consumption was 370 EJ – an increase of 2% over the past year. 40% of the energy consumed globally comes in the form of oil and oil products while coal and gas have an equal share of 20% each. Combined, fossil fuels accounted for 80% of the energy consumption globally in 2017. The share of renewable energy in the gross final energy consumption globally was 17.7% in 2017 – a drop of 0.2% over the previous year. Among renewable energy sources, bioenergy (energy from bio-based sources) is the largest. In 2017, bioenergy accounted for 70% of the renewable energy consumption. The contribution of bioenergy share has been decreasing by a few percentage points (approx. 0.5% - 1%) annually partly due to decreasing use of traditional biomass sources. Renewable energy technologies have made considerable progress in decarbonizing the electricity sector. In 2017, renewable electricity covered about 25% of the electricity generated globally. In 2017, electricity from biomass-based sources was the 3rd largest renewable electricity source after hydropower and wind. 596 TWh of biopower was generated. Almost half of all energy consumption is in the form of heat – space heating for residential and commercial establishments and heating demand for industrial processes. One of the most widely used renewable energy source for derived heating is biomass which has a 96% share in the renewable heat market globally. In the transport sector, biomass-based fuels (bioethanol, biodiesel etc.) are one of the best options for replacing fossil oil. The share of biofuels in the transport sector in 2017 was about 3% with a total contribution of 3.5 EJ. Biomass dominates the end use sector of direct heating. In 2017, 40 EJ of biomass was consumed in end use sectors of residential, commercial, agriculture etc. for heating and cooking purposes which accounts for about 95% of renewable energy use in these sectors. In 2017, 55.6 EJ of biomass was utilized for energy purposes – 86% of the use was in the form of primary solid biofuels including wood chips, wood pellets, fuelwood for cooking and heating etc. 7% of the biomass was used as liquid biofuels. Biogas, municipal waste, industrial waste had almost equal share at 2 – 3%. One of the most promising sectors for growth in bioenergy production is in the form of residues from agriculture sector. Currently, the sector contributes less than 3% to the total bio- energy production. Data shows that utilizing the residues from all major crops for energy can generate approx. 4.3 billion tonnes (low estimate) to 9.4 billion tonnes (high estimate) annually around the world. Utilizing standard energy conversion factors, the theoretical energy potential from residues can be in the range of 17.8 EJ to 82.3 EJ. The major contribution would be from cereals – mainly maize, rice and wheat. Energy generation from agricultural residues could meet about 3 – 14% of the total energy supply globally. The forestry sector is the largest contributor to the bioenergy mix globally. Forestry products including charcoal, fuelwood, pellets and wood chips account for more than 85% of all the biomass used for energy purposes. One of the primary products from forests that are used for bioenergy production is woodfuel. Most of the woodfuel is used for traditional cooking and heating in developing countries in Asia and Africa. Globally, 1.9 billion m3 of woodfuel was used for energy purposes. The third and final category for bioenergy supply is municipal and industrial waste utilized for energy predominantly in urban areas. In 2017, domestic supply of waste to bioenergy was 2.51 EJ – 58% was in the form of municipal waste while the remaining was industrial waste to energy. Special sectors deal with data on biogas, pellets and charcoal. In 2018, 35.4 million tonnes of wood pellets were produced – 55% of the production occurred in Europe while Americas (mainly USA) accounted for 31%. In 2017, 1.33 EJ of biogas was produced globally while Europe accounted for more than half of the annual production. With regard to charcoal, 51.6 million tonnes of charcoal were produced globally with Africa as the main producer and consumer of charcoal accounting for 65% of the production and using predominantly for cooking. Renewable energy technologies create jobs. Globally, 11 million people were employed in the renewable energy industry by the end of 2018. Bioenergy is the 2nd largest employer globally with approx. 3.2 million people working in the bioenergy supply chain.

The resources section includes all our relevant publications: The Global Bioenergy Statistics (GBS) report is the main annual publication of WBA. The report provides data on the global development of biomass to energy. Factsheets present an unbiased overview of bioenergy technologies and are a guiding tool for policy makers, researchers and companies. WBA publishes reports on various issues of bioenergy including sustainability, biofuels, land use, biogas etc. The Sustainability Verification Scheme sets rules for guiding stakeholders to establish an acceptable management for collecting biomass for energy. One of our main activity is to set up bioenergy associations worldwide. The guide informs associations to engage actors in the whole bioenergy supply chain. The objective of WBA Bioenergy magazines is keeping track on the development of WBA as an organization along with developments in the bioenergy field.

220,"Stephan Schmidheiny - Wikipedia Stephan Schmidheiny From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Stephan Schmidheiny (1992) Stephan Ernst Schmidheiny (born 29 October 1947) is a Swiss entrepreneur, philanthropist and advocate of sustainable development[citation needed]. In 2019, his net worth was estimated by Forbes to be $2.3 billion.[1] He's also well known for being convicted over his role in the Italian asbestos scandal. [2] Contents 1 Life 2 Career 2.1 Eternit / Exit from Asbestos, Reflection and Legal Disputes 2.2 Sentenced for Involuntary Manslaughter 2.3 Other engagements 3 Philanthropy 3.1 Rio Summit 1992 3.2 AVINA Foundation 3.3 Other philanthropy 4 Awards 5 References 6 External links Life[edit] Stephan Ernest Schmidheiny was born in Balgach, St. Gallen, Switzerland, on 29 October 1947 as a fourth generation member of one of the key industrial families in Switzerland and completed his Law studies with a doctorate at the University of Zurich in 1972.[citation needed] From 1974 until 2002, Stephan Schmidheiny was married to Ruth Schmidheiny (Administrator of the Daros Latinamerica AG from 1974 until 2002). He has a son and a daughter with Ruth and currently lives in Hurden, Switzerland. Since 2012, he has been married to Dr. Viktoria Schmidheiny-Werner.[citation needed] Schmidheiny is an advocate and leader in the field of sustainable development.[citation needed] Career[edit] Eternit / Exit from Asbestos, Reflection and Legal Disputes[edit] In 1972, Stephan Schmidheiny started his business career at Eternit. In 1976, at the age of 29, he was named CEO of the Swiss Eternit Group. According to his brother Thomas Schmidheiny, their father Max Schmidheiny decided to divide his industrial empire into two halves: asbestos for Stephan, cement for Thomas.[3] As a result of this split of activities, Stephan Schmidheiny inherited Eternit. According to his official biography,[4] he ended the company's use of asbestos in 1986. Five years before in 1981, Schmidheiny, then Chairman, announced Eternit's intention to dispense entirely with its involvement in asbestos production and distribution, far ahead of the 2005 European-wide asbestos ban. Subsequently, Eternit worked to develop and fund research to develop new fiber blends to replace asbestos. In 1984, a majority of Eternit products were manufactured asbestos free. Since 2009, due to his involvement in his family's industrial dynasty and despite his efforts to exit from asbestos, Stephan Schmidheiny has been involved in trials in Italy, one for environmental disaster and another for voluntary manslaughter, both connected to the employ of asbestos in the factories of Eternit.[3] In the first trial Stephan Schmidheiny was sentenced to 16 years imprisonment on February 13, 2012.[5] On June 3, 2013, the judgment given in February was not only confirmed, but also increased to 18 years imprisonment for environmental damage by the Turin Appeal Court,[6] In November 2014, it was ruled that the statute of limitations had passed.[7][8] In 2014, Schmidheiny was acquitted of the charges for alleged negligent behavior in Italy. In 2015, a second trial called ""Eternit Bis"" began,[9] Stephan Schmidheiny defended against the accusation of voluntary manslaughter. On November 29, 2016 the allegations raised in Eternit Bis were dismissed by the court in Turin and the case closed. Some legal proceedings regarding negligent homicide are still possible, e.g. in Vercelli, Reggio Emilia, Naples as well as in Turin [10] Schmidheiny has emphasized that his involvement with the Eternit group was long before the health risks of asbestos were understood, and long before production was prohibited in Italy; this ban did not happen until 1992. He admitted in an interview in 2015[11] that the strain from the legal proceedings in Italy had deeply affected him. Later, however, he felt the proceedings had become absurd, especially after an Italian judge compared him to Hitler and his actions comparable with “the final solution”. Beyond the aforementioned legal proceedings, Stephan Schmidheiny set up funds for victims of asbestos-related diseases in South Africa and Italy, as these countries had no successor company to Eternit, which could bear the financial consequences of asbestos exposure.[12] Sentenced for Involuntary Manslaughter[edit] In May 2019, Stephan Schmidheiny, the former majority shareholder in Italian asbestos company Eternit Genova, has been sentenced to four years in prison by a Turin court for the death of two workers.[13] The ruling marks the latest twist in a decade-long battle between Schmidheiny, the Italian government, former Eternit workers and residents of towns near the company’s asbestos plants. Prosecutor Gianfranco Colace said the ruling was the “first step” in setting a precedent on deaths from cancer and pulmonary diseases, which can take years to develop after contact with asbestos fibers.[14] Other engagements[edit] While Schmidheiny withdrew from asbestos production and Eternit, he invested in new industrial segments, building up a multinational conglomerate of shareholdings by adding enterprises in the areas of forestry, banking, consumer goods, power generation, as well as electronic and optical equipment. He also joined the boards of directors of leading companies such as ABB Asea Brown Boveri, Nestlé, Swatch, and UBS AG. In 1985 Schmidheiny supported Nicolas Hayek in his bid for the Swiss watch holding company Société de Microélectronique et d'Horlogerie(SMH), which resulted in the rescue of the Swiss watch industry. Later from this valuable alliance, the present day Swatch Group was formed.[15] In 1987, as an anchor shareholder in Brown, Boveri & Cie (BBC), Schmidheiny co-organized a merger of BBC with ASEA of Sweden. This led to the creation of the newly positioned, market leader in its segment, ASEA Brown Boveri, today known as ABB Group.[citation needed] In 1987, he took over two-thirds of the capital of Landis + Gyr from the family shareholders, as they could provide no successor for leadership. In doing so, Schmidheiny was aware that major changes were necessary, as the company was not doing well. Schmidheiny restructured the company. In 1995, the company was taken over by the Swiss company Elektrowatt.[citation needed] Philanthropy[edit] Philanthropic pursuits have been important to Schmidheiny and since the 1990s, he has devoted his life to these pursuits. Schmidheiny is an advocate and leader in the field of sustainable development. He served as adviser on sustainability to the United Nations as well as to the OECD.[16][17] In the 1980s he created FUNDES,[18] an organization that supports the development of small and medium-sized enterprises in several Latin American countries. According to recent Swiss accounts, Schmidheiny began buying Chilean forest land in 1982, and he now owns over 120,000 hectares in Southern Chile, near Concepción, land which the Mapuche Indians claim has been theirs since time immemorial. The Mapuche charge that some of the land Schmidheiny bought was stolen from them during the Pinochet dictatorship, using that regime's standard techniques of intimidation, torture, and murder.[19] In 2019 Forbes put Schmidheiny in the list of the world's most generous philanthropists outside of the US.[20] Rio Summit 1992[edit] In 1990 Schmidheiny was appointed chief adviser for business and industry to the secretary general of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), better known as the Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit of 1992. The conference took place in 1992, with 172 governments participating. As chief advisor to this conference, Schmidheiny created a forum in which leading businessmen from all parts of the world developed a business perspective on environment and development challenges. This forum later became the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), an organization that today counts the world's 160 most important companies as its members. Schmidheiny was elected honorary chairman, in recognition of his pioneering role in the phase-out of production of building materials containing asbestos. Following his involvement in the Rio Summit, Schmidheiny authored the book Change of Course: Global Business Prospects for Development and the Environment,[21] published by MIT Press in 1992. His book offers an extensive analysis of how businesses can make sustainable development their focus, his book has been translated into fifteen languages.[22] He also contributed to Financing Change: The Financial Community, Eco-efficiency, and Sustainable Development [23] also published by MIT Press. AVINA Foundation[edit] In the 1990s Schmidheiny established the Fundación AVINA ,[24] which contributes to sustainable development in Latin America by encouraging productive alliances among social and business leaders and today is a leading player in that field. Schmidheiny's foundation pioneered a South American microfinance system similar to that of Muhammad Yunus whose widely praised system benefits the citizens of Bangladesh. Stephan Schmidheiny's charitable activities in South America have meant a donation of over one billion US dollars to the region.[25] After the creation of VIVA Trust in 2003, Schmidheiny retired from all of his executive functions, including his positions in GrupoNueva [26] and AVINA. Other philanthropy[edit] In 1993, Schmidheiny in memory of his late brother Alexander, who died in 1992, founded the Alexander Schmidheiny Foundation [27] with the inheritance from his brother's estate. This Foundation is active in the St. Gallen Rhine Valley.[citation needed] Schmidheiny supports arts and culture through a series of initiatives. He has developed and expanded the art collection of his deceased brother Alexander, the Daros Collection. The Daros Collection, based in Zurich is a substantial collection of North American and European art from the second half of the 20th century.[28] Stephan is a contributor to the Zurich Chamber Orchestra and other important cultural institutions.[citation needed] In Gstaad, he and his wife Victoria are seeking to build a new cultural center called Les Arts Gstaad.[29] On Schmidheiny's website[30] is possible to find a specific section about his ""philanthropic activities"" and another about his engagement for ""ecological efficience"".[citation needed] According to information from Fundacion MarViva, Schmidheiny has played a foundational role in starting this organization that bridges scientific research with public activism for the promotion of marine habitat near and in the Costa Rica Thermal Dome, with an organizational presence in Costa Rica, Panama, and Columbia.[31] Awards[edit] Schmidheiny has received a large number of prizes and awards in recognition of his leadership and his contribution to sustainable development.[citation needed] These include a 1993 honorary doctorate from the Instituto Centroamerica de Administración de Empresas (INCAE), Costa Rica [32] and the same honorary doctorate in 1996 by Yale University.[33] and in 2001 by Rollins College,[34] Florida, and the Andrés Bello Catholic University (UCAB), Caracas.[35] In 2001, Schmidheiny received the Zayed International Prize for the Environment for ""Environmental Action Leading to Positive Change in Society"".[36] In 2007, during the PODER Green Forum, Schmidheiny was awarded a Philanthropy Award.[37] References[edit] ^ ""Stephan Schmidheiny"".

Contents 1 Operations 2 Impact and influence 3 Membership 3.1 Forética 4 Governance 5 Geographic balance 6 Controversies 7 References 8 External links Operations[edit] The Council works on a variety of issues related to sustainable development. It works to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through the transformation of six economic systems. These are circular economy,[9] Cities and Mobility,[10] Climate and Energy,[11] Food, Land and Water,[12] People[13] and Redefining Value.[14] Each system transformation is set up as a WBCSD Program with a number of supplementary Projects.[15] Impact and influence[edit] A 2003 World Bank/IFC commissioned study identified the WBCSD as one of the ""most influential forums"" for companies on corporate social responsibility (CSR) issues.[16] A 2004 Globescan survey found the WBCSD as the second most effective SD research organization.[17] The 2006 survey by the same company reports that 54% of all surveyed experts believe the WBCSD will play a ""major role"" in advancing sustainable development. Only the European Union received higher approval (69%).[18] In the 2007's Ethisphere Institute list of the 100 Most Influential People in Business Ethics, WBCSD President Bjoern Stigson has been ranked ninth, which made him the second most influential NGO leader.[19] Membership[edit] Membership of the WBCSD is by invitation of the Executive Committee to companies committed to sustainable development. Among its over 180 members[20] are well-known companies such as DuPont, 3M, Nestlé, BP, Danone and Royal Dutch Shell. WBCSD provides its members with the value, impact and voice to navigate unprecedented global changes and allows them to prosper from transforming their operations. By joining the WBCSD, member companies benefit from insights into the latest knowledge on sustainability, sustainability tools, peer collaboration across the value chain, participation in policy development and a chance to profile their sustainability work.[20] Member companies pledge their support and contribution to the WBCSD by making available their knowledge and experience, and appropriate human resources. They are asked to publicly report on their environmental performance and to aspire to widen their reporting to cover all three pillars of sustainable development – economic, social and environmental. A key element is the personal commitment of the Chief Executive Officers (CEOs), acting as Council Members. They are influential advocates for the WBCSD's policy positions and they co-chair the working groups. They also organize support for the WBCSD's work program and ensure the adoption of sustainable management practices within their companies. Forética[edit] Forética claims to be global network of Spanish speaking businesses and professionals whose mission is to promote an ethical management and corporate social responsibility by the establishment of a National standard in Spain known as SGE-21, (sistema de gestación ética para siglo 21) which is also Annex 1 to ISO 26000 and supported by CSR Europe[21] Membership is said to around 400 and includes companies of all sizes and sectors, as well as individual specialists, professionals and academics and it was incorporated into WBCSD on 2 September 2014.[22] Governance[edit] The WBCSD is a member-led organization governed by a Council composed of the Council Members of its member companies. The Council elects the Executive Committee, including the Chairman and four Vice Chairmen. Past chairmen include: Rodney F. Chase – BP (1995) Livio D. DeSimone – 3M (1996/97) Egil Myklebust – Norsk Hydro (1998/99) Charles O. Holliday, Jr. – DuPont (2000/01) Sir Philip Watts KCMG – Royal Dutch Shell (2002/03) Bertrand Collomb – Lafarge (2004/05) Travis Engen – Alcan (2006/07) Sam DiPiazza – PwC (2008/09) Paul Polman – Unilever (2012–17) Sunny Verghese – Olam (2018–2020) Geographic balance[edit] Most of WBCSD's member companies are headquartered in Europe (47%). 22% member companies are headquartered in Asia, 22% in North America and 5% in Latin America. The geographically least represented regions are Africa, Australasia and the Middle East with 1% each.[20] Controversies[edit] According to Greenpeace the World Business Council for Sustainable Development is among the key players responsible for holding the world societies from tackling the climate change and energy management challenges for the past 20 years. The WBCSD Executive Committee was dominated by the largest non-renewable energy and carbon-intensive companies in the world at least until 2011. According to Greenpeace the WBCSD executive committee has been a 'Who's Who' of the world's largest carbon-intensive companies.[23] The Sierra Club has collaborated with the World Business Council on a number of initiatives, as well as inviting its representatives to speak at Sierra Club events.[24][25] The Environmental Defense Fund recommends the World Business Council's auditing methods to companies seeking to reduce greenhouse emissions,[26] and the Natural Resources Defense Council has drawn upon WBCSD guidelines in drawing up their own guidelines for determining biofuels sustainability.[27] The WBCSD's Vision 2050 report was highlighted by The Guardian as ""the largest concerted corporate sustainability action plan to date – include reversing the damage done to ecosystems, addressing rising greenhouse gas emissions and ensuring societies move to sustainable agriculture.""[28] References[edit] ^ ""Sunny Verghese appointed as WBCSD Chair from 2018"".

WBCSD’s unique collaborative platform enables members to transform their value chains and, with innovative approaches to integrated performance management, risk management and purpose-driven disclosure, create new market opportunities, resilience, and attract lower cost of capital than companies which take no action. Circular Economy A circular economy is fundamental to achieving our vision of more than 9 billion people living well within the boundaries of the planet by 2050. Moving towards a circular economy requires decoupling resource consumption and economic performance, through information sharing, new business models, supporting policies, science-based targets and value chain collaboration.WBCSD's Circular Economy Program convenes over 50 companies to co-develop solutions that unlock their full circular potential. Through a safe platform for business, this program creates new standards, tools, advocacy, insights and experiences that empower companies to drive their circular transition. Explore Cities & Mobility More than half of the global population lives in cities, and it is projected that over the next two decades over 1 million people will move to cities every week. To reach the Sustainable Development Goals in cities provides a significant business opportunity estimated at 3.7tn USD by 2030, in the areas of housing, building efficiency, mobility, water and sanitation. Businesses are developing many solutions that can support urban sustainability, but they need a strategic engagement process to understand cities’ needs and place their solutions in a holistic context. Explore Climate & Energy Combating climate change and transforming the energy system are core challenges on the path to a sustainable future for business, society and the environment. The Paris Agreement has sent a decisive and global signal that the start of the transition to a thriving, clean economy is inevitable, irreversible and irresistible.Our Climate & Energy Program facilitates interaction on cutting-edge climate and energy topics between WBCSD members, their peers and stakeholders as they address critical industry issues and share best practices and solutions. Explore Food & Nature Economic systems are outstripping the resources of the planet. Diets are resulting in both over- and under-nutrition. Humanity’s future depends on an urgent reset – the creation of systems that support healthy people and a healthy planet. WBCSD’s Food & Nature Program leads business efforts to accelerate the much-needed system transformation in the areas of food, nature and water. We do this by bringing leadership standards and tools, advocacy and projects across the value chain – from production to consumption – which deliver impact at scale where the urgent agendas of climate, nature and food systems intersect. Explore People & Society Today’s society is characterized by a range of dynamic shifts and evolutions. WBCSD’s People & Society program provides insights & solutions that support companies in future-proofing their businesses by ensuring that their products, services, processes and conduct remain in tune with the needs, rights, goals and aspirations of society. Explore Redefining Value Redefining Value helps companies measure and manage risk, gain competitive advantage and seize new opportunities by understanding environmental, social and governance (ESG) information.We do this by building collaborations and developing tools, guidance, case studies, engagement and education opportunities to help companies incorporate ESG performance into mainstream business and finance systems.Our goal is to improve decision-making and external disclosure, eventually transforming the financial system to reward the most sustainable companies. Explore Sector Project Bringing together key players in the same sector under one platform, to advance sustainability across the entire sector. These projects include the Chemical Group, Forest Solutions Group (FSG),  Global Agribusiness Alliance (GAA) and Tire Industry Project (TIP). How do we do it? Innovation We deliver pioneering sustainable business solutions Collaboration We connect companies, partners and sectors to deliver results that no single company could achieve alone. Valuation Our goal is an economy based on true value, true profits and true costs: ensuring more sustainable companies are more successful.

Please improve this by adding secondary or tertiary sources. (May 2012) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The World Coal Association (WCA) is an international non-profit, non-governmental association based in London, United Kingdom. It was created to represent the global coal industry. The association was formerly called the World Coal Institute (WCI) but changed its name in November 2010. The WCA undertakes lobbying, organises workshops, and provides coal information to decision makers in international energy and environmental policy and research discussions, as well as supplying information to the general public and educational organisations on the benefits and issues surrounding the use of coal. It also promotes clean coal technologies. It has participated in a number of United Nations and International Energy Agency (IEA) workshops, boards, and forums, including the UN Commission on Sustainable Development,[1] the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change,[2] the IEA Working Party on Fossil Fuels, and the IEA Coal Industry Advisory Board.[3] It is also part of the Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum.[4] It is co-author of a report on the future of coal in ASEAN nations.

See tripod record Related Collections Homer Jack (DG 063) NGO Committee on Disarmament (DG 139) World Conference on Religion and Peace (USA) (DG 059) Historical Background The World Conference on Religion and Peace (WCRP), was ""a world-wide movement, consisting of men and women of faith who meet to share their concerns about the many factors and situations which threaten world peace and deny human dignity. While acknowledging that religious elements have aggravated rather than reconciled existing tensions and conflicts, yet we would work together as religious people and with all people of good-will for the realization of a world free of violence -- a world in which all people may live in freedom, justice, and peace."" [quoted from the brochure announcing the Fourth World Assembly in August 1984] The first World Conference on Religion and Peace (1st world assembly) was held in Kyoto, Japan, in October 1970, but the idea for holding such a conference is attributed to the dreams of four religious leaders in the United States who began meeting in the fall of 1962. Rabbi Maurice Eisendrath, Dr. Dana McLean Greeley, Bishop John Wesley Lord, and Bishop John Wright, together with several others, arranged two conferences in the U.S. (the first in January 1964 in New York and a second, much larger, National Inter-Religious Conference on Peace in Washington in March 1966) before deciding to explore the possibilities for a world-wide conference of religious leaders. In 1967, Homer A. Jack and Herschel Halbert traveled to Asia to seek out sympathetic partners with whom they could work to plan for a world conference. In January 1968, a group of 20 Americans undertook a round-the-world peace mission, with stops in Geneva, Rome, Istanbul, and Jerusalem to consult with top representatives of four major world religions. The trip included a week-long International Inter-Religious Symposium on Peace in New Delhi (sponsored by the U.S. Inter-Religious Committee on Peace and the Gandhi Peace Foundation) and a Japanese-American Inter-Religious Consultation on Peace held on January 22, 1968, in Kyoto. Based on the success of these meetings, an Interim Advisory Committee (composed of religious leaders primarily from India, Japan, and the U.S.) was formed which gathered in Istanbul in February 1969 to explore convening a world conference. This led to the formation of a Preparatory Committee for a World Conference on Religion and Peace which met in July and December 1969. Archbishop Angelo I. Fernandes agreed to serve as President of the World Conference on Religion and Peace, with Rev. Nikkyo Niwano and Dr. Dana McLean Greeley as co-chairmen. Homer A. Jack, then working for the Unitarian Universalist Association in Boston, became Secretary-Genera, working first in Boston and later in Japan. The Kyoto Conference (1st world assembly) brought together about 250 delegates from ten major religions and from 39 nations to discuss the areas of disarmament, development, and human rights. The focus of attention was religion as applied to current world problems, not religion itself. The final plenary session of this assembly endorsed the recommendation of the Conference Follow-Up Committee that a continuing organization be established, to be called the World Conference of Religion for Peace. (This name was used until 1974 when it again became the World Conference on Religion and Peace.) A Board of Directors was formed, which elected Archbishop Angelo I. Fernandes as President (in which capacity he served from 1970 to 1984), and six vice-presidents. Homer A. Jack was appointed as Secretary-General, and pledges were received to cover the first year's budget of $65,000. In December l970, the international headquarters of WCRP were opened at the Church Center for the United Nations in New York, New York. The organization was immediately granted status as an international organization associated with the Office of Public Information at the United Nations. The international headquarters of WCRP remained in New York until the retirement of Homer A. Jack as Secretary-General in December 1983. Following the appointment of Dr. John B. Taylor as Secretary-General, it was decided to move the international headquarters to Geneva, Switzerland, early in 1984. Initially, the major support for WCRP, financial and otherwise, came from Japan and the United States. Through the years, a network of regional and national committees of WCRP were developed throughout the world. The European Secretariat of the WCRP was established in 1974. Dr. Maria A. Lucker served as Secretary-General of this group from 1974 until her death in November 1983. She was succeeded by Dr. Norbert Klaes, formerly Associate Secretary of WCRP/International. The Asian Conference on Religion and Peace, with headquarters in Singapore, was established in 1976. Mehervan Singh served as Secretary-General. In addition to these regional groups, national WCRP groups have been established in at least 17 countries (by mid-l983), with regular contacts in many other countries. Four other world conferences have been held since the Kyoto Conference in 1970. The Second World Conference on Religion and Peace (2nd world assembly) was held at Louvain, Belgium, from August 28 - September 3, 1974. Attended by participants from 50 countries, the general theme of this assembly was ""Religion and the Quality of Life."" It was more of a working conference than the 1st assembly, with more time spent in four simultaneous commissions (disarmament and security, economic development and human liberation, human rights and fundamental freedoms, and environment and survival), and in working parties and panel discussions. The Louvain Declaration, adopted overwhelmingly, was widely distributed after the assembly. The Third World Conference on Religion and Peace (3rd world assembly) was held in Princeton, New Jersey, from August 29 - September 7, 1979, on the theme ""Religion in the Struggle for World Community."" Three hundred fifty persons from 47 countries attended, including a delegation from China. The program of included visits to the United Nations and to Washington, DC. A Fourth World Assembly was held August 23 - 31, 1984, in Nairobi, Kenya. Nearly 600 participants from 60 countries met to address the theme: ""Religions for Human Dignity and World Peace."" The Fifth World Assembly was held in January 1989 in Melbourne, Australia. Numerous smaller conferences/consultations among national and regional WCRP groups have been held in addition to these major world conferences. These include several Inter-Religious Consultations on Japanese-American Relations (1968, 1972, 1983), two Asian Conferences on Religion and Peace (Singapore, 1976; New Delhi, 1981), a North American Consultation on Religion and Peace (1972), and an All Africa Assembly on Religion and Peace (1983), among others. In addition to holding conferences of religious leaders, WCRP was involved in several education/action/service programs. The first of these was the Boat People Project in 1976-1977, established by the Asian Conference on Religion and Peace and the World Conference on Religion and Peace early in December 1976. Thich Nhat Hanh was the initial Director of the Project but was relieved of responsibility in mid-February 1977, when the two ships at sea (chartered by WCRP) -- with a total of 555 refugees on board -- was finding it extremely difficult to find permanent homes for these ""boat people."" The Board of the Boat People Project announced in March that the Project would terminate when passengers from both ships were given permanent asylum. It was not until September 1977 that all passengers had disembarked, and many were still living in refugee camps awaiting permanent resettlement. Substantial donations were received from all religions and all continents to meet the costs of this Project. A second attempt to help victims of a war-torn country was the WCRP Khmer Fund (October 1979 - May 1980) and the WCRP Khmer Program (May 1980 - May 1981). This effort was initiated at the 3rd assembly when the Board of Directors asked the Secretary-General to explore possibilities for a project relating to Kampuchea (Cambodia). Both Homer Jack and Howard Schomer (on loan from the United Church Board of World Ministries to serve WCRP as Associate Secretary for Kampuchean Issues) traveled to Bangkok and visited the Thai-Kampuchean border to seek ways of helping the Khmer people. After consulting with many people, the WCRP team developed a six-point program and agreed to hire a Director for one year. David R. Hawk was hired for this position in May 1980. The central purpose of the Program was to ""work for the physical and cultural survival of the Khmer people...., seek to help them in their emergency relief needs, and to attain justice and peace."" A series of WCRP Reports on Kampuchea was issued from 1978-1981. In November 1981, a third major action project was launched when it was decided to send Multi-Religious Missions to five world capitals (Beijing, London, Moscow, Paris, Washington) to discuss disarmament issues, particularly the Second United Nations Special Session on Disarmament which was to be held in June 1982. A 10-person team of WCRP leaders from around the world visited Beijing in May 1982 for discussions with Chinese leaders. No other Missions were actually held, although preliminary consultations were held in London and Washington. Since the establishment of its headquarters near the United Nations in New York City, WCRP was a close observer of United Nations discussion and activity, particularly in the areas of disarmament, development, and human rights. After being granted consultative status with ECOSOC in 1973, the WCRP and its representatives were given certain privileges to submit communications and in other ways to attempt to influence the policies of the United Nations Homer Jack wrote many memos, articles and reports on issues which were distributed to United Nations' delegates and to representatives of other non-governmental organizations (NGOs). WCRP cooperated with other NGOs, both in ad hoc committees and in ongoing organizations such as the NGO Committee on Human Rights and the NGO Committee on Disarmament (at United Nations Headquarters). Homer Jack served as chairman of the latter group from its establishment in 1973 until he retired from the WCRP in December 1983. He was a frequent observer at United Nations special conferences (e.g. World Food Conference, 1974; Review Conferences on the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, 1975 and 1980) and was very active during preparations for the two United Nations Special Sessions on Disarmament (1978, 1982). In addition, WCRP arranged special visits to the United Nations by WCRP representatives, including the Inter-Religious Presence at the United Nations during the 26th United Nations General Assembly (1971), a Japanese Peace Mission to the United Nations (1973), and a visit to the United Nations during WCRP's 3rd assembly. The WCRP office often served as a hospitality and information center for WCRP representatives visiting the United Nations and arranged numerous meetings and receptions for the United Nations community. Major WCRP publications include the unabridged proceedings of the first four world assemblies, and two books on the United Nations Special Sessions on Disarmament (Disarmament Workbook: The United Nations Special Session and Beyond and Disarm--or Die; the Second United Nations Special Session on Disarmament). A newsletter is published regularly (Beyond Kyoto, 1971-1974; Religion for Peace, 1974-date). Over 100 WCRP Reports have appeared since 1971, mainly on United Nations topics. In addition, numerous leaflets and pamphlets have been published to publicize WCRP activity and to focus on areas of concern to the organization.

Arrangement of Collection The records of the World Conference on Religion and Peace came to the Swarthmore College Peace Collection in numerous accessions since 1970. Most of these contained material in addition to WCRP records: personal papers of Homer A. Jack, items relating to the U.S. Inter-Religious Committee on Peace (later WCRP/USA), records of the NGO Committee on Disarmament (at United Nations Headquarters) of which Homer Jack was chairman, as well as material on other organizations and reference material on topics of interest to Homer Jack and to the WCRP. Much of the non-WCRP material was removed and filed in other collections. The records of the WCRP are arranged in several series, each covering a particular time period. It was decided that the major world conferences would determine the period of time to be included in each series. Additional material, received through mailings from the WCRP up through 1995, is in the final box.

Professor. Ioan SaucaRegionInternationalOrigin1948Members350 (member churches)Official websitewww.oikoumene.org The World Council of Churches (WCC) is a worldwide Christian inter-church organization founded in 1948 to work for the cause of ecumenism.[1] Its full members today include the Assyrian Church of the East, the Oriental Orthodox Churches, most jurisdictions of the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Old Catholic Church, the Lutheran Churches, the Anglican Communion, the Mennonite Churches, the Methodist Churches, the Moravian Church and the Reformed Churches, as well as the Baptist Churches and Pentecostal Churches.[1][2][3] Notably, the Catholic Church is not a full member, although it sends delegates to meetings who have observer status.[1][4] The WCC arose out of the ecumenical movement and has as its basis the following statement: The World Council of Churches is a fellowship of churches which confess the Lord Jesus Christ as God and Savior according to the scriptures, and therefore seek to fulfill together their common calling to the glory of the one God: Father, Son and Holy Spirit. It is a community of churches on the way to visible unity in one faith and one eucharistic fellowship, expressed in worship and in common life in Christ. It seeks to advance towards this unity, as Jesus prayed for his followers, ""so that the world may believe"". (John 17:21)[5] The WCC describes itself as ""a worldwide fellowship of 349 global, regional and sub-regional, national and local churches seeking unity, a common witness and Christian service"".[6] It has no head office as such, but its administrative centre is at the Ecumenical Centre in Geneva, Switzerland.[7] The organization's members include denominations which claim to collectively represent over 500 million people across the world in more than 110 countries.[8] Many regional affiliates of the World Council of Churches, such as the Middle East Council of Churches and National Council of Churches in Australia, work for the cause of Christian unity at the domestic level, with member denominations including the Oriental Orthodox Churches, Lutheran Churches, Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Churches, Methodist Churches, Anglican Communion, Reformed Churches, among others.[9][10] Contents 1 History 2 Events and presidents 2.1 Assemblies 2.2 Presidents 2.3 General secretaries 3 Commissions and teams 3.1 Diakonia and development and international relations commissions 3.2 Faith and Order Commission 3.2.1 Texts 3.3 Justice, Peace and Creation Commission 3.4 Relations with the Roman Catholic Church 3.5 Special Commission on Orthodox Participation in the WCC 4 Peace journalism 5 Spin-offs and related organizations 6 Regional/national councils 7 Criticism 7.1 Alleged neglect of suffering church in Eastern Europe 7.2 Claims of infiltration and influence by the KGB 7.3 Attitude towards Israel 7.4 Opposition to Christian Zionism 8 See also 9 References 9.1 Citations 9.2 Sources 10 Further reading 11 External links History[edit] The Ecumenical Movement met with initial successes in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including the Edinburgh Missionary Conference of 1910 (chaired by future WCC Honorary President John R. Mott). In 1920, the Ecumenical Patriarch of the Eastern Orthodox Church, Germanus V of Constantinople, wrote a letter ""addressed 'To all the Churches of Christ, wherever they may be', urging closer co-operation among separated Christians, and suggesting a 'League of Churches', parallel to the newly founded League of Nations"".[11] Church leaders agreed in 1937 to establish a World Council of Churches, based on a merger of the Faith and Order Movement (under Charles Brent of the Episcopal Church of the United States) and Life and Work (conference)|Life and Work Movement (under Nathan Söderblom of the Lutheran Church of Sweden) organisations. Its official establishment was deferred with the outbreak of World War II until August 23, 1948. Delegates of 147 churches assembled in Amsterdam to merge the Faith and Order Movement and Life and Work Movement.[12] This was consolidated by a second meeting at Lund in 1950, for which the British Methodist Robert Newton Flew edited an influential volume of studies, The Nature of the Church.[13] Subsequent mergers were with the International Missionary Council in 1961 and the World Council of Christian Education, with its roots in the 18th century Sunday School movement, in 1971. WCC member churches include the Assyrian Church of the East and the Oriental Orthodox Churches, almost all of the Eastern Orthodox Churches and Lutheran Churches; the Moravian Church; the Anglican Communion; some Old Catholic Churches; the Methodist Churches; the Presbyterian and other Reformed Churches, a sampling of united and independent churches, and some Baptist and Pentecostal churches.[1][2] Many churches who refused to join the WCC joined to form the World Evangelical Alliance.[14] Delegates sent from the member churches meet every seven or eight years in an Assembly, which elects a Central Committee that governs between Assemblies. A variety of other committees and commissions answer to the Central Committee and its staff. Assemblies have been held since 1948. The ""human rights abuses in communist countries evoked grave concern among the leaders of the World Council of Churches.""[15] However, historian Christopher Andrew claims that, during the Cold War, a number of important WCC representatives of the Orthodox Church in Eastern Europe had been working for the KGB, and that they influenced the policy of the WCC.[16] From 1955 to 1958, Robert S. Bilheimer co-chaired a WCC international commission to prepare a document addressing the threat of nuclear warfare during the Cold War.[17] At the 1961 conference, a 32-year-old Russian Orthodox Bishop named Aleksey Ridiger was sent as delegate to the assembly, and then appointed to the WCC's central committee. He was later elected as Russian patriarch in 1990 as Alexei II.[18] The ninth assembly took place in Porto Alegre, Brazil in February 2006, under the theme ""God, in your grace, transform the world"".[19] During the first Assemblies, theologians Vasileios Ioannidis and Amilkas Alivizatos contributed significantly to the debates that led to the drafting of the ""Toronto Statement"", a foundational document which facilitated Eastern Orthodox participation in the organization and today it constitutes its ecclesiological charter.[20] The 10th Assembly was held in Busan, Republic of Korea, from 30 October to 8 November 2013.[21] In 2013 Dr. Agnes Abuom of Nairobi, from the Anglican Church of Kenya, was elected as moderator of the Central Committee of the World Council of Churches; she is the first woman and the first African to hold this position.[22] Events and presidents[edit] Assemblies[edit] The World Council of Churches has held 10 Assemblies to date, starting with the founding assembly in 1948:[23] Amsterdam, Netherlands, 22 August – 4 September 1948 Evanston, Illinois, United States, 15–31 August 1954 New Delhi, India, 19 November – 5 December 1961 Uppsala, Sweden, 4–20 July 1968 Nairobi, Kenya, 23 November – 10 December 1975 Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada 24 July – 10 August 1983 Canberra, ACT, Australia, 7–21 February 1991[24] Harare, Zimbabwe, 3–14 December 1998 Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, 14–23 February 2006 Busan, South Korea, 30 October – 8 November 2013 Presidents[edit] Presidents of the current 10th Assembly are:[25][26] Africa: Mary-Anne Plaatjies van Huffel (Uniting Reformed Church in Southern Africa) Asia: Chang Sang (Presbyterian Church in the Republic of Korea) Europe: Archbishop Anders Wejryd (Church of Sweden) Latin America and Caribbean: The Rev.

Martin Niemöller, the famous Protestant anti-Nazi theologian T. C. Chao, Chinese theologian General secretaries[edit] Since the World Council of Churches was officially founded in 1948, the following men have served as general secretary:[27] Years Name Churches Nationality 1948–1966 W. A. Visser 't Hooft Dutch Reformed Church[28]/Federation of Swiss Protestant Churches, Geneva Netherlands 1966–1972 Eugene Carson Blake United Presbyterian Church (USA) United States 1972–1984 Philip A.

The Faith and Order Movement and Life and Work Movement represent these approaches.[29] These approaches are reflected in the work of the WCC in its commissions, these being: Echos- Commission on Youth (ages 18–30) Commission of the Churches on Diakonia and Development Commission on Education and Ecumenical Formation Commission of the Churches on International Affairs Commission on Justice, Peace and Creation Commission on World Mission and Evangelism Faith and Order Plenary Commission and the Faith and Order Standing Commission Joint Consultative Group with Pentecostals Joint Working Group WCC – Catholic Church (Vatican) Reference Group on the Decade to Overcome Violence Reference Group on Inter-Religious Relations Special Commission on Orthodox Participation in the WCC Diakonia and development and international relations commissions[edit] The WCC acts through both its member churches and other religious and social organizations to coordinate ecumenical, evangelical, and social action. Current WCC programs include a Decade to Overcome Violence, an international campaign to combat AIDS/HIV in Africa and the Justice, Peace and Creation initiative. Faith and Order Commission[edit] Main article: Faith and Order Commission WCC's Faith and Order Commission has been successful in working toward consensus on Baptism, Eucharist, and Ministry, on the date of Easter, on the nature and purpose of the church (ecclesiology), and on ecumenical hermeneutics. Texts[edit] Baptism, Eucharist and Ministry (Faith and Order Paper No. 111, the “Lima Text”; 1982)[30] The Churchː Towards a Common Vision (Faith and Order Paper no. 214; 2013[31]) after The Nature and Mission of the Church – A Stage on the Way to a Common Statement (Faith and Order Paper no. 198; 2005[32]) and The Nature and Purpose of the Church (Faith and Order Paper no. 181; 1998[33]) Towards a Common Date of Easter[34] Justice, Peace and Creation Commission[edit] Justice, Peace and Creation has drawn many elements together with an environmental focus. Its mandate is: To analyze and reflect on justice, peace and creation in their interrelatedness, to promote values and practices that make for a culture of peace, and to work towards a culture of solidarity with young people, women, Indigenous Peoples and racially and ethnically oppressed people.[35] Focal issues have been globalization and the emergence of new social movements (in terms of people bonding together in the struggle for justice, peace, and the protection of creation).[36] Attention has been given to issues around: economy[37] environment[38] Indigenous Peoples[39] peace[40] people with disabilities[41] racism[42] women[43] youth[44] Relations with the Roman Catholic Church[edit] This section does not cite any sources.

(March 2019) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The largest Christian body, the Roman Catholic Church, is not a member of the WCC, but has worked closely with the council for more than three decades and sends observers to all major WCC conferences as well as to its Central Committee meetings and the Assemblies (cf. Joint Working Group). The Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity also nominates 12 members to the WCC's Faith and Order Commission as full members. While not a member of the WCC, the Catholic Church is a member of some other ecumenical bodies at regional and national levels, for example, the National Council of Churches in Australia and the National Council of Christian Churches in Brazil (CONIC). Pope Pius XI stated in 1928, that the only means by which the world Christian community was to return to faith, was to return to Roman Catholic Worship. In this regard, the Papacy rejected, to a great extent, the idea of the participation of the Catholic Church within the World Council of Churches. Pius XI stated that the ‘One true Church’ was that of the Roman Catholic denomination, and therefore there was the implication that the Catholic Church was not permitted at this stage to engage with other denominations, which the Papacy considered to be irrelevant. The Catholic Church therefore did not attend the 1948 meeting of the WCC, in addition to the idea that all members of the church were barred from attending WCC conferences. Pope John XXIII took a different stance however, and in 1958 he was elected as the head of the Catholic Church. Ecumenism was a new element of catholic ideology which had been permitted, which was signified to a great extent, when John XXIII met with the then Archbishop of Canterbury, Geoffrey Fisher. This was the first meeting between an Archbishop of Canterbury, and the Pope in the Vatican for 600 years. John XXIII later developed the office of the Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity; which symbolised a dramatic shift in support for the ecumenical movement, from the Catholic Church, led from the Vatican. 1961 saw Catholic members attend the Delhi conference of the WCC, which marked a significant shift in attitude toward the WCC from the Papacy. There was the idea in addition to this, that the Pope invited non-Catholics to attend the Vatican II Council.[1] This new approach to inter-denominational relations was marked within the Unitatis Redintegratio. This document marked several key reforms within the Catholic approach: I.	‘Separated brethren’ was the new term for non-Catholics, as opposed to the previously used ‘heretics’[citation needed] II.	Both Catholic and non-Catholic elements are held responsible for the schism between Catholicism and the Protestant movement[citation needed] III.	Non-Catholics are recognised to the contributions that they make to Christian belief overall[citation needed] Further reforms have been enacted with regard to the nature of the Catholic Church on the world stage, for instance the 1965 union with the Patriarch of Constantinople, whereby the 1054 schism was undermined. In addition to this, Michael Ramsay, the then Archbishop of Canterbury, received an episcopal ring in 1966; a mark of union which had not been seen since prior to the Reformation. Moreover, the Anglican, Roman Catholic International Committee was additionally established as a means of promoting communication and cohesion between the two denominations. This has since marked a new level of participation of the Catholic Faith in the aforementioned ecumenical movement, and therefore is the basis for increased participation from the faith, in the WCC. Special Commission on Orthodox Participation in the WCC[edit] A Special Commission was set up by the eighth Harare Assembly in December 1998 to address Orthodox concerns about WCC membership and the council's decision-making style, public statements, worship practices, and other issues. It issued its final report in 2006.[45] Specific issues that it clarified were that the WCC does not formulate doctrine, does not have authority to rule on moral issues, nor does it have any ecclesiastical authority. Such authority is entirely internal to each individual member church. It proposed that the WCC adopt a consensus method of decision making. It proposed that Orthodox members be brought in parity with non-Orthodox members. It further proposed clarification that inter-confessional prayer at WCC events is not worship, particularly ""it should avoid giving the impression of being the worship of a church"", and confessional and inter-confessional prayer each be specifically identified as such at WCC events. Peace journalism[edit] The WCC is also a prominent supporter and practitioning body for Peace journalism: journalism practice that aims to avoid a value bias in favor of violence that often characterizes coverage of conflict.[46] Spin-offs and related organizations[edit] The ACT Alliance, bringing together over 100 church-backed relief and development organizations worldwide, was born out of the merger of ACT International (Action by Churches Together International) and ACT Development (Action by Churches Together for Development) in March 2010. Both ACT International, established in 1995, and ACT Development (2007) were created through the leadership of the World Council of Churches (WCC). The two bodies coordinated the work of agencies related to the member churches of the WCC and the Lutheran World Federation in the areas of humanitarian emergencies and poverty reduction respectively.[47] The Ecumenical Advocacy Alliance was officially founded in December 2000 at a meeting convened by the WCC. There are currently 73 churches and Christian organizations that are members of the Alliance, from Catholic, Evangelical, Orthodox and Protestant traditions. These members, representing a combined constituency of tens of millions of people around the world, are committed to working together in public witness and action for justice on defined issues of common concern. Current campaigns are on Food and on HIV and AIDS.[48] The Ecumenical Church Loan Fund (ECLOF) was founded in 1946 as one of the world's first international micro-credit institutions in the service of the poor. Willem Visser 't Hooft, then general secretary of the ""WCC in process of formation"" played an important role in founding ECLOF. It was he who sketched the prospects and challenges for the proposed institution and gave specific ideas on potential sources of funds. His inspiration and teamwork marked the beginning of a long and fruitful cooperation between ECLOF and the WCC.[49] The Ecumenical Development Cooperative Society U.A (now known as Oikocredit) was developed from discussions at the 1968 Uppsala 4th Assembly, regarding church divestment from financial institutions supporting apartheid-era South Africa and the war in Vietnam. After several years of planning, the cooperative society was founded in 1975 in the Netherlands to provide an alternative ethical investment vehicle to church institutions, by providing credit to productive enterprises serving economically disadvantaged populations. Originally organized for large institutional members of the WCC, by 1976 local congregations developed Support Associations to enable congregations as well as individuals to participate. EDCS became independent from the WCC in 1977.[50] Ecumenical News International (ENI) was launched in 1994 as a global news service reporting on ecumenical developments and other news of the churches, and giving religious perspectives on news developments worldwide. The joint sponsors of ENI, which was based at the Ecumenical Centre in Geneva, Switzerland, are the World Council of Churches, the Lutheran World Federation, the World Alliance of Reformed Churches, and the Conference of European Churches, which also have their headquarters at the Ecumenical Centre.[51] A shortage of funds led to the suspension of the work of ENI in 2012.[52] As of 2015 ENI remains closed. Regional/national councils[edit] The WCC has not sought the organic union of different Christian denominations, but it has, however, facilitated dialogue and supported local, national, and regional dialogue and cooperation. Membership in a regional or national council does not mean that the particular group is also a member of the WCC.

(May 2020) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Some historians, the U.S. State Department and former KGB officers themselves have alleged and provided corroborating evidence that the KGB's influence directly, or through lobbying by means of a front organization, the Christian Peace Conference, resulted in the WCC's failure to recognize or act on calls for help from persecuted East European Christians at the 1983 Vancouver General Assembly.[60][61]:647–8 Claims of infiltration and influence by the KGB[edit] It is claimed the KGB has infiltrated and influenced past WCC councils and policy.[16] In 1992, Father Gleb Yakunin, a vice Chairman of a Russian parliamentary commission that investigated the activities of the KGB, citing verbatim KGB reports, claimed that its Fifth Directorate was actively involved in influencing WCC policy from 1967 to 1989.[60][62] For example, in the 1983 WCC General Assembly in Vancouver, one cited document described the presence and activities of 47 KGB agents to secure the election of an ""acceptable"" candidate as General Secretary.[62][63] The Mitrokhin Archive reveals more about the depth of the penetration and influence wielded by the KGB over the WCC.[61] Metropolitan Nikidim was a KGB agent, codenamed ADAMANT, who served as one of six WCC Presidents from 1975 until his death.[61]:729[64] His earlier intervention had resulted in the WCC making no comment on the invasion of Czechoslovakia.[61]:636 As a result of his influence and that of other agents, it is claimed the USSR was rarely publicly criticised.[61]:637 In 1989, copies of the KGB documents claim ""the WCC executive and central committee adopted public statements (eight) and messages (three)"" which corresponded to its own political direction.[61]:637 Appeals from suffering dissidents both from within the Russian Orthodox Church and Protestants were ignored in 1983.[61]:647–8 Metropolitan Aleksi Ridiger of Tallinn and Estonia was repeatedly alleged to be a KGB agent codenamed DROZDOV, who in 1988 was awarded an honorary citation for services to the KGB by its chairman.[61]:650[65][66] Despite official disavowals, The Guardian described the evidence as ""compelling"".[67] In 1990 he became Alexius II, the 15th Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church. Upon his death in 2008, the WCC's official tribute, by its Council officers, described him as ""courageous"", ""supportive and constructive"" and the recipient of ""abundant blessing"", no reference was made to the allegations.[68][69] Attitude towards Israel[edit] The World Council of Churches has been described as taking an adversarial position toward the state of Israel.[70] It has also been claimed the council has focused particularly on activities and publications criticizing Israel in comparison with other human rights issues.[71][72] It is similarly claimed that it downplayed appeals from Egyptian Copts about human rights abuses under Sadat and Mubarak, in order to focus on its neighbour.[70] In 2009, the Council called for an international boycott on goods produced in Israeli settlements, which it described as 'illegal, unjust' and 'incompatible with peace'.[73] In 2013, the General Secretary was reported to claim in Cairo, ""We support the Palestinians. The WCC supports the Palestinians, because they are in the right.""[74] The WCC's Ecumenical Accompaniment Programme in Palestine and Israel (EAPPI) has been criticised by the Board of Deputies of British Jews for promoting ""an inflammatory and partisan programme at the expense of its interfaith relations"".[75] The WCC secretariat was involved in preparing and helped disseminate the Kairos Palestine Document, which declares “the Israeli occupation of Palestinian land is a sin against God and humanity because it deprives the Palestinians of their basic human rights”, and in the view of one critic, its ""authors want to see a single state"".[76] On the other hand, the WCC claims ""Antisemitism is sin against God and man"".[77] Opposition to Christian Zionism[edit] Christian Zionism, which has long represented a major thread of historic and contemporary Protestants,[78][79] is characterised as a view which ""distort(s) the interpretation of the Word of God"" and ""damage(s) intra-Christian relations"".[80] In this context, what is a source of concern is that Islamic fundamentalisms are giving rise to a counter reaction of other religious fundamentalisms, the most dangerous of which is Jewish fundamentalism which exploits the Islamic fundamentalist phenomenon to justify before western societies the distasteful aberrations of Zionism in Palestine.— WCC working paper, Lebanon, May 2013[81] Frank Chikane, moderator of the Commission of the Churches on International Affairs (CCIA) of the World Council of Churches (WCC), was criticised for using the term 'demons' to describe advocacy for Zionism in 2021.[82] See also[edit] Christian denominationsin the English-speaking world International associationsInterdenominational associations World Council of Churches World Evangelical Alliance Denominational associations Friends World Committee for Consultation Mennonite World Conference Anglican Communion Baptist World Alliance World Convention of Churches of Christ Eastern Orthodox Church Confessional Evangelical Lutheran Conference International Lutheran Council Lutheran World Federation World Methodist Council Pentecostal World Conference International Conference of Reformed Churches Reformed Ecumenical Council World Communion of Reformed Churches World Reformed Fellowship Regional associations Africa All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC) Association of Evangelicals of Africa (AEA) All Africa Baptist Fellowship Africa Lutheran Communion Asia Christian Conference of Asia (CCA) Evangelical Fellowship of Asia Asia Pacific Baptist Federation Asia Lutheran Communion Caribbean Caribbean Conference of Churches (CCC) Evangelical Association of the Caribbean Caribbean Baptist Fellowship Europe Conference of European Churches (CEC) European Evangelical Alliance European Baptist Federation Pentecostal European Fellowship Middle East Middle East Council of Churches (MECC) Latin America Latin American Council of Churches (CLAI) Latin American Evangelical Fellowship (FIDE) Union of Baptists in Latin America North America North American Baptist Fellowship Assembly of Canonical Orthodox Bishops of the United States of America North American Presbyterian and Reformed Council Pacific Pacific Conference of Churches (PCC) Evangelical Fellowship of the South Pacific (EFSP) Asia Pacific Baptist Federation AustraliaChristian denominations in Australia Australian interchurch Australian Evangelical Alliance  • website National Council of Churches Catholic Catholic Church in Australia Anglican Anglican Church of Australia Holiness and Pietist Christian and Missionary Alliance Christian Outreach Centre Church of the Nazarene Salvation Army Seventh-day Adventist Church Historical Protestantism Australian Friends Australian Baptist Ministries Open Brethren Christian Reformed Churches of Australia Churches of Christ Fellowship of Congregational Churches Lutheran Church of Australia Presbyterian Church of Australia Uniting Church in Australia Wesleyan Methodist Church of Australia Eastern Christian Antiochian Orthodox of Australia and New Z.

Since its creation, it has also established a cordial cooperation with the World Council of Churches and regularly names Catholic observers at various ecumenical gatherings and invites observers of ""fraternal delegates"" of other churches or ecclesial communities to major events of the Catholic Church. The PCPCU publishes a journal called Information Service four times a year, in English and French. The WCC is the broadest and most inclusive among the many organized expressions of the modern ecumenical movement. It brings together 349 churches, denominations and church fellowships in more than 100 countries and territories throughout the world, representing over 560 million Christians and including most of the world's Orthodox churches, scores of Anglican, Baptist, Lutheran, Methodist and Reformed churches, as well as many United and Independent churches. ... It describes itself as a fellowship of churches which confess the Lord Jesus Christ as God and Savior according to the Scriptures and therefore seek to fulfill together their common calling to the glory of the one God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, with the goal of visible unity in one faith and one Eucharistic fellowship, expressed in worship and in common life in Christ. ^ a b Roberson, Ronald G.

These Churches are the Armenian Apostolic Church, the Coptic Orthodox Church, the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, the Syrian Orthodox Church, and the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church in India. In addition, an independent Orthodox Church of Eritrea was established following that country's independence from Ethiopia in 1993. All are members of the World Council of Churches and have committed themselves to the contemporary ecumenical movement. In total, there are probably about thirty million Oriental Orthodox faithful in the world today. ^ ""Member list — World Council of Churches"". World Council of Churches. 2014.

ISBN 9780140146561. From the beginning of the twentieth century the Ecumenical Patriarchate has shown a special concern for Christian reconciliation. At his accession in 1902, Patriarch Joachim III sent an encyclical letter to all the autocephalous Eastern Orthodox Churches, asking in particular for their opinion on relations with other Christian bodies. In January 1920 the Ecumenical Patriarchate followed this up with a bold and prophetic letter addressed 'To all the Churches of Christ, wherever they may be', urging closer co-operation among separated Christians, and suggesting a 'League of Churches', parallel to the newly founded League of Nations. Many of the ideas in this letter anticipate subsequent developments in the WCC. Constantinople, along with several of the other Eastern Orthodox Churches, was represented at the Faith and Order Conferences at Lausanne in 1927 and at Edinburgh in 1937. The Ecumenical Patriarchate also participated in the first Assembly of the WCC at Amsterdam in 1948, and has been a consistent supporter of the work of the WCC ever since. ^ ""WCC Assemblies 1948 - today"".

Professor. Ioan SaucaRegionInternationalOrigin1948Members350 (member churches)Official websitewww.oikoumene.org The World Council of Churches (WCC) is a worldwide Christian inter-church organization founded in 1948 to work for the cause of ecumenism.[1] Its full members today include the Assyrian Church of the East, the Oriental Orthodox Churches, most jurisdictions of the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Old Catholic Church, the Lutheran Churches, the Anglican Communion, the Mennonite Churches, the Methodist Churches, the Moravian Church and the Reformed Churches, as well as the Baptist Churches and Pentecostal Churches.[1][2][3] Notably, the Catholic Church is not a full member, although it sends delegates to meetings who have observer status.[1][4] The WCC arose out of the ecumenical movement and has as its basis the following statement: The World Council of Churches is a fellowship of churches which confess the Lord Jesus Christ as God and Savior according to the scriptures, and therefore seek to fulfill together their common calling to the glory of the one God: Father, Son and Holy Spirit. It is a community of churches on the way to visible unity in one faith and one eucharistic fellowship, expressed in worship and in common life in Christ. It seeks to advance towards this unity, as Jesus prayed for his followers, ""so that the world may believe"". (John 17:21)[5] The WCC describes itself as ""a worldwide fellowship of 349 global, regional and sub-regional, national and local churches seeking unity, a common witness and Christian service"".[6] It has no head office as such, but its administrative centre is at the Ecumenical Centre in Geneva, Switzerland.[7] The organization's members include denominations which claim to collectively represent over 500 million people across the world in more than 110 countries.[8] Many regional affiliates of the World Council of Churches, such as the Middle East Council of Churches and National Council of Churches in Australia, work for the cause of Christian unity at the domestic level, with member denominations including the Oriental Orthodox Churches, Lutheran Churches, Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Churches, Methodist Churches, Anglican Communion, Reformed Churches, among others.[9][10] Contents 1 History 2 Events and presidents 2.1 Assemblies 2.2 Presidents 2.3 General secretaries 3 Commissions and teams 3.1 Diakonia and development and international relations commissions 3.2 Faith and Order Commission 3.2.1 Texts 3.3 Justice, Peace and Creation Commission 3.4 Relations with the Roman Catholic Church 3.5 Special Commission on Orthodox Participation in the WCC 4 Peace journalism 5 Spin-offs and related organizations 6 Regional/national councils 7 Criticism 7.1 Alleged neglect of suffering church in Eastern Europe 7.2 Claims of infiltration and influence by the KGB 7.3 Attitude towards Israel 7.4 Opposition to Christian Zionism 8 See also 9 References 9.1 Citations 9.2 Sources 10 Further reading 11 External links History[edit] The Ecumenical Movement met with initial successes in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including the Edinburgh Missionary Conference of 1910 (chaired by future WCC Honorary President John R. Mott). In 1920, the Ecumenical Patriarch of the Eastern Orthodox Church, Germanus V of Constantinople, wrote a letter ""addressed 'To all the Churches of Christ, wherever they may be', urging closer co-operation among separated Christians, and suggesting a 'League of Churches', parallel to the newly founded League of Nations"".[11] Church leaders agreed in 1937 to establish a World Council of Churches, based on a merger of the Faith and Order Movement (under Charles Brent of the Episcopal Church of the United States) and Life and Work (conference)|Life and Work Movement (under Nathan Söderblom of the Lutheran Church of Sweden) organisations. Its official establishment was deferred with the outbreak of World War II until August 23, 1948. Delegates of 147 churches assembled in Amsterdam to merge the Faith and Order Movement and Life and Work Movement.[12] This was consolidated by a second meeting at Lund in 1950, for which the British Methodist Robert Newton Flew edited an influential volume of studies, The Nature of the Church.[13] Subsequent mergers were with the International Missionary Council in 1961 and the World Council of Christian Education, with its roots in the 18th century Sunday School movement, in 1971. WCC member churches include the Assyrian Church of the East and the Oriental Orthodox Churches, almost all of the Eastern Orthodox Churches and Lutheran Churches; the Moravian Church; the Anglican Communion; some Old Catholic Churches; the Methodist Churches; the Presbyterian and other Reformed Churches, a sampling of united and independent churches, and some Baptist and Pentecostal churches.[1][2] Many churches who refused to join the WCC joined to form the World Evangelical Alliance.[14] Delegates sent from the member churches meet every seven or eight years in an Assembly, which elects a Central Committee that governs between Assemblies. A variety of other committees and commissions answer to the Central Committee and its staff. Assemblies have been held since 1948. The ""human rights abuses in communist countries evoked grave concern among the leaders of the World Council of Churches.""[15] However, historian Christopher Andrew claims that, during the Cold War, a number of important WCC representatives of the Orthodox Church in Eastern Europe had been working for the KGB, and that they influenced the policy of the WCC.[16] From 1955 to 1958, Robert S. Bilheimer co-chaired a WCC international commission to prepare a document addressing the threat of nuclear warfare during the Cold War.[17] At the 1961 conference, a 32-year-old Russian Orthodox Bishop named Aleksey Ridiger was sent as delegate to the assembly, and then appointed to the WCC's central committee. He was later elected as Russian patriarch in 1990 as Alexei II.[18] The ninth assembly took place in Porto Alegre, Brazil in February 2006, under the theme ""God, in your grace, transform the world"".[19] During the first Assemblies, theologians Vasileios Ioannidis and Amilkas Alivizatos contributed significantly to the debates that led to the drafting of the ""Toronto Statement"", a foundational document which facilitated Eastern Orthodox participation in the organization and today it constitutes its ecclesiological charter.[20] The 10th Assembly was held in Busan, Republic of Korea, from 30 October to 8 November 2013.[21] In 2013 Dr. Agnes Abuom of Nairobi, from the Anglican Church of Kenya, was elected as moderator of the Central Committee of the World Council of Churches; she is the first woman and the first African to hold this position.[22] Events and presidents[edit] Assemblies[edit] The World Council of Churches has held 10 Assemblies to date, starting with the founding assembly in 1948:[23] Amsterdam, Netherlands, 22 August – 4 September 1948 Evanston, Illinois, United States, 15–31 August 1954 New Delhi, India, 19 November – 5 December 1961 Uppsala, Sweden, 4–20 July 1968 Nairobi, Kenya, 23 November – 10 December 1975 Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada 24 July – 10 August 1983 Canberra, ACT, Australia, 7–21 February 1991[24] Harare, Zimbabwe, 3–14 December 1998 Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, 14–23 February 2006 Busan, South Korea, 30 October – 8 November 2013 Presidents[edit] Presidents of the current 10th Assembly are:[25][26] Africa: Mary-Anne Plaatjies van Huffel (Uniting Reformed Church in Southern Africa) Asia: Chang Sang (Presbyterian Church in the Republic of Korea) Europe: Archbishop Anders Wejryd (Church of Sweden) Latin America and Caribbean: The Rev.

Martin Niemöller, the famous Protestant anti-Nazi theologian T. C. Chao, Chinese theologian General secretaries[edit] Since the World Council of Churches was officially founded in 1948, the following men have served as general secretary:[27] Years Name Churches Nationality 1948–1966 W.

The Faith and Order Movement and Life and Work Movement represent these approaches.[29] These approaches are reflected in the work of the WCC in its commissions, these being: Echos- Commission on Youth (ages 18–30) Commission of the Churches on Diakonia and Development Commission on Education and Ecumenical Formation Commission of the Churches on International Affairs Commission on Justice, Peace and Creation Commission on World Mission and Evangelism Faith and Order Plenary Commission and the Faith and Order Standing Commission Joint Consultative Group with Pentecostals Joint Working Group WCC – Catholic Church (Vatican) Reference Group on the Decade to Overcome Violence Reference Group on Inter-Religious Relations Special Commission on Orthodox Participation in the WCC Diakonia and development and international relations commissions[edit] The WCC acts through both its member churches and other religious and social organizations to coordinate ecumenical, evangelical, and social action. Current WCC programs include a Decade to Overcome Violence, an international campaign to combat AIDS/HIV in Africa and the Justice, Peace and Creation initiative. Faith and Order Commission[edit] Main article: Faith and Order Commission WCC's Faith and Order Commission has been successful in working toward consensus on Baptism, Eucharist, and Ministry, on the date of Easter, on the nature and purpose of the church (ecclesiology), and on ecumenical hermeneutics. Texts[edit] Baptism, Eucharist and Ministry (Faith and Order Paper No. 111, the “Lima Text”; 1982)[30] The Churchː Towards a Common Vision (Faith and Order Paper no. 214; 2013[31]) after The Nature and Mission of the Church – A Stage on the Way to a Common Statement (Faith and Order Paper no. 198; 2005[32]) and The Nature and Purpose of the Church (Faith and Order Paper no. 181; 1998[33]) Towards a Common Date of Easter[34] Justice, Peace and Creation Commission[edit] Justice, Peace and Creation has drawn many elements together with an environmental focus. Its mandate is: To analyze and reflect on justice, peace and creation in their interrelatedness, to promote values and practices that make for a culture of peace, and to work towards a culture of solidarity with young people, women, Indigenous Peoples and racially and ethnically oppressed people.[35] Focal issues have been globalization and the emergence of new social movements (in terms of people bonding together in the struggle for justice, peace, and the protection of creation).[36] Attention has been given to issues around: economy[37] environment[38] Indigenous Peoples[39] peace[40] people with disabilities[41] racism[42] women[43] youth[44] Relations with the Roman Catholic Church[edit] This section does not cite any sources.

(March 2019) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The largest Christian body, the Roman Catholic Church, is not a member of the WCC, but has worked closely with the council for more than three decades and sends observers to all major WCC conferences as well as to its Central Committee meetings and the Assemblies (cf. Joint Working Group). The Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity also nominates 12 members to the WCC's Faith and Order Commission as full members. While not a member of the WCC, the Catholic Church is a member of some other ecumenical bodies at regional and national levels, for example, the National Council of Churches in Australia and the National Council of Christian Churches in Brazil (CONIC). Pope Pius XI stated in 1928, that the only means by which the world Christian community was to return to faith, was to return to Roman Catholic Worship. In this regard, the Papacy rejected, to a great extent, the idea of the participation of the Catholic Church within the World Council of Churches. Pius XI stated that the ‘One true Church’ was that of the Roman Catholic denomination, and therefore there was the implication that the Catholic Church was not permitted at this stage to engage with other denominations, which the Papacy considered to be irrelevant. The Catholic Church therefore did not attend the 1948 meeting of the WCC, in addition to the idea that all members of the church were barred from attending WCC conferences. Pope John XXIII took a different stance however, and in 1958 he was elected as the head of the Catholic Church. Ecumenism was a new element of catholic ideology which had been permitted, which was signified to a great extent, when John XXIII met with the then Archbishop of Canterbury, Geoffrey Fisher. This was the first meeting between an Archbishop of Canterbury, and the Pope in the Vatican for 600 years. John XXIII later developed the office of the Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity; which symbolised a dramatic shift in support for the ecumenical movement, from the Catholic Church, led from the Vatican. 1961 saw Catholic members attend the Delhi conference of the WCC, which marked a significant shift in attitude toward the WCC from the Papacy. There was the idea in addition to this, that the Pope invited non-Catholics to attend the Vatican II Council.[1] This new approach to inter-denominational relations was marked within the Unitatis Redintegratio. This document marked several key reforms within the Catholic approach: I.	‘Separated brethren’ was the new term for non-Catholics, as opposed to the previously used ‘heretics’[citation needed] II.	Both Catholic and non-Catholic elements are held responsible for the schism between Catholicism and the Protestant movement[citation needed] III.	Non-Catholics are recognised to the contributions that they make to Christian belief overall[citation needed] Further reforms have been enacted with regard to the nature of the Catholic Church on the world stage, for instance the 1965 union with the Patriarch of Constantinople, whereby the 1054 schism was undermined. In addition to this, Michael Ramsay, the then Archbishop of Canterbury, received an episcopal ring in 1966; a mark of union which had not been seen since prior to the Reformation. Moreover, the Anglican, Roman Catholic International Committee was additionally established as a means of promoting communication and cohesion between the two denominations. This has since marked a new level of participation of the Catholic Faith in the aforementioned ecumenical movement, and therefore is the basis for increased participation from the faith, in the WCC. Special Commission on Orthodox Participation in the WCC[edit] A Special Commission was set up by the eighth Harare Assembly in December 1998 to address Orthodox concerns about WCC membership and the council's decision-making style, public statements, worship practices, and other issues. It issued its final report in 2006.[45] Specific issues that it clarified were that the WCC does not formulate doctrine, does not have authority to rule on moral issues, nor does it have any ecclesiastical authority. Such authority is entirely internal to each individual member church. It proposed that the WCC adopt a consensus method of decision making. It proposed that Orthodox members be brought in parity with non-Orthodox members. It further proposed clarification that inter-confessional prayer at WCC events is not worship, particularly ""it should avoid giving the impression of being the worship of a church"", and confessional and inter-confessional prayer each be specifically identified as such at WCC events. Peace journalism[edit] The WCC is also a prominent supporter and practitioning body for Peace journalism: journalism practice that aims to avoid a value bias in favor of violence that often characterizes coverage of conflict.[46] Spin-offs and related organizations[edit] The ACT Alliance, bringing together over 100 church-backed relief and development organizations worldwide, was born out of the merger of ACT International (Action by Churches Together International) and ACT Development (Action by Churches Together for Development) in March 2010. Both ACT International, established in 1995, and ACT Development (2007) were created through the leadership of the World Council of Churches (WCC). The two bodies coordinated the work of agencies related to the member churches of the WCC and the Lutheran World Federation in the areas of humanitarian emergencies and poverty reduction respectively.[47] The Ecumenical Advocacy Alliance was officially founded in December 2000 at a meeting convened by the WCC. There are currently 73 churches and Christian organizations that are members of the Alliance, from Catholic, Evangelical, Orthodox and Protestant traditions. These members, representing a combined constituency of tens of millions of people around the world, are committed to working together in public witness and action for justice on defined issues of common concern. Current campaigns are on Food and on HIV and AIDS.[48] The Ecumenical Church Loan Fund (ECLOF) was founded in 1946 as one of the world's first international micro-credit institutions in the service of the poor. Willem Visser 't Hooft, then general secretary of the ""WCC in process of formation"" played an important role in founding ECLOF. It was he who sketched the prospects and challenges for the proposed institution and gave specific ideas on potential sources of funds. His inspiration and teamwork marked the beginning of a long and fruitful cooperation between ECLOF and the WCC.[49] The Ecumenical Development Cooperative Society U.A (now known as Oikocredit) was developed from discussions at the 1968 Uppsala 4th Assembly, regarding church divestment from financial institutions supporting apartheid-era South Africa and the war in Vietnam. After several years of planning, the cooperative society was founded in 1975 in the Netherlands to provide an alternative ethical investment vehicle to church institutions, by providing credit to productive enterprises serving economically disadvantaged populations. Originally organized for large institutional members of the WCC, by 1976 local congregations developed Support Associations to enable congregations as well as individuals to participate. EDCS became independent from the WCC in 1977.[50] Ecumenical News International (ENI) was launched in 1994 as a global news service reporting on ecumenical developments and other news of the churches, and giving religious perspectives on news developments worldwide. The joint sponsors of ENI, which was based at the Ecumenical Centre in Geneva, Switzerland, are the World Council of Churches, the Lutheran World Federation, the World Alliance of Reformed Churches, and the Conference of European Churches, which also have their headquarters at the Ecumenical Centre.[51] A shortage of funds led to the suspension of the work of ENI in 2012.[52] As of 2015 ENI remains closed. Regional/national councils[edit] The WCC has not sought the organic union of different Christian denominations, but it has, however, facilitated dialogue and supported local, national, and regional dialogue and cooperation. Membership in a regional or national council does not mean that the particular group is also a member of the WCC.

(May 2020) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Some historians, the U.S. State Department and former KGB officers themselves have alleged and provided corroborating evidence that the KGB's influence directly, or through lobbying by means of a front organization, the Christian Peace Conference, resulted in the WCC's failure to recognize or act on calls for help from persecuted East European Christians at the 1983 Vancouver General Assembly.[60][61]:647–8 Claims of infiltration and influence by the KGB[edit] It is claimed the KGB has infiltrated and influenced past WCC councils and policy.[16] In 1992, Father Gleb Yakunin, a vice Chairman of a Russian parliamentary commission that investigated the activities of the KGB, citing verbatim KGB reports, claimed that its Fifth Directorate was actively involved in influencing WCC policy from 1967 to 1989.[60][62] For example, in the 1983 WCC General Assembly in Vancouver, one cited document described the presence and activities of 47 KGB agents to secure the election of an ""acceptable"" candidate as General Secretary.[62][63] The Mitrokhin Archive reveals more about the depth of the penetration and influence wielded by the KGB over the WCC.[61] Metropolitan Nikidim was a KGB agent, codenamed ADAMANT, who served as one of six WCC Presidents from 1975 until his death.[61]:729[64] His earlier intervention had resulted in the WCC making no comment on the invasion of Czechoslovakia.[61]:636 As a result of his influence and that of other agents, it is claimed the USSR was rarely publicly criticised.[61]:637 In 1989, copies of the KGB documents claim ""the WCC executive and central committee adopted public statements (eight) and messages (three)"" which corresponded to its own political direction.[61]:637 Appeals from suffering dissidents both from within the Russian Orthodox Church and Protestants were ignored in 1983.[61]:647–8 Metropolitan Aleksi Ridiger of Tallinn and Estonia was repeatedly alleged to be a KGB agent codenamed DROZDOV, who in 1988 was awarded an honorary citation for services to the KGB by its chairman.[61]:650[65][66] Despite official disavowals, The Guardian described the evidence as ""compelling"".[67] In 1990 he became Alexius II, the 15th Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church. Upon his death in 2008, the WCC's official tribute, by its Council officers, described him as ""courageous"", ""supportive and constructive"" and the recipient of ""abundant blessing"", no reference was made to the allegations.[68][69] Attitude towards Israel[edit] The World Council of Churches has been described as taking an adversarial position toward the state of Israel.[70] It has also been claimed the council has focused particularly on activities and publications criticizing Israel in comparison with other human rights issues.[71][72] It is similarly claimed that it downplayed appeals from Egyptian Copts about human rights abuses under Sadat and Mubarak, in order to focus on its neighbour.[70] In 2009, the Council called for an international boycott on goods produced in Israeli settlements, which it described as 'illegal, unjust' and 'incompatible with peace'.[73] In 2013, the General Secretary was reported to claim in Cairo, ""We support the Palestinians. The WCC supports the Palestinians, because they are in the right.""[74] The WCC's Ecumenical Accompaniment Programme in Palestine and Israel (EAPPI) has been criticised by the Board of Deputies of British Jews for promoting ""an inflammatory and partisan programme at the expense of its interfaith relations"".[75] The WCC secretariat was involved in preparing and helped disseminate the Kairos Palestine Document, which declares “the Israeli occupation of Palestinian land is a sin against God and humanity because it deprives the Palestinians of their basic human rights”, and in the view of one critic, its ""authors want to see a single state"".[76] On the other hand, the WCC claims ""Antisemitism is sin against God and man"".[77] Opposition to Christian Zionism[edit] Christian Zionism, which has long represented a major thread of historic and contemporary Protestants,[78][79] is characterised as a view which ""distort(s) the interpretation of the Word of God"" and ""damage(s) intra-Christian relations"".[80] In this context, what is a source of concern is that Islamic fundamentalisms are giving rise to a counter reaction of other religious fundamentalisms, the most dangerous of which is Jewish fundamentalism which exploits the Islamic fundamentalist phenomenon to justify before western societies the distasteful aberrations of Zionism in Palestine.— WCC working paper, Lebanon, May 2013[81] Frank Chikane, moderator of the Commission of the Churches on International Affairs (CCIA) of the World Council of Churches (WCC), was criticised for using the term 'demons' to describe advocacy for Zionism in 2021.[82] See also[edit] Christian denominationsin the English-speaking world International associationsInterdenominational associations World Council of Churches World Evangelical Alliance Denominational associations Friends World Committee for Consultation Mennonite World Conference Anglican Communion Baptist World Alliance World Convention of Churches of Christ Eastern Orthodox Church Confessional Evangelical Lutheran Conference International Lutheran Council Lutheran World Federation World Methodist Council Pentecostal World Conference International Conference of Reformed Churches Reformed Ecumenical Council World Communion of Reformed Churches World Reformed Fellowship Regional associations Africa All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC) Association of Evangelicals of Africa (AEA) All Africa Baptist Fellowship Africa Lutheran Communion Asia Christian Conference of Asia (CCA) Evangelical Fellowship of Asia Asia Pacific Baptist Federation Asia Lutheran Communion Caribbean Caribbean Conference of Churches (CCC) Evangelical Association of the Caribbean Caribbean Baptist Fellowship Europe Conference of European Churches (CEC) European Evangelical Alliance European Baptist Federation Pentecostal European Fellowship Middle East Middle East Council of Churches (MECC) Latin America Latin American Council of Churches (CLAI) Latin American Evangelical Fellowship (FIDE) Union of Baptists in Latin America North America North American Baptist Fellowship Assembly of Canonical Orthodox Bishops of the United States of America North American Presbyterian and Reformed Council Pacific Pacific Conference of Churches (PCC) Evangelical Fellowship of the South Pacific (EFSP) Asia Pacific Baptist Federation AustraliaChristian denominations in Australia Australian interchurch Australian Evangelical Alliance  • website National Council of Churches Catholic Catholic Church in Australia Anglican Anglican Church of Australia Holiness and Pietist Christian and Missionary Alliance Christian Outreach Centre Church of the Nazarene Salvation Army Seventh-day Adventist Church Historical Protestantism Australian Friends Australian Baptist Ministries Open Brethren Christian Reformed Churches of Australia Churches of Christ Fellowship of Congregational Churches Lutheran Church of Australia Presbyterian Church of Australia Uniting Church in Australia Wesleyan Methodist Church of Australia Eastern Christian Antiochian Orthodox of Australia and New Z.

Since its creation, it has also established a cordial cooperation with the World Council of Churches and regularly names Catholic observers at various ecumenical gatherings and invites observers of ""fraternal delegates"" of other churches or ecclesial communities to major events of the Catholic Church. The PCPCU publishes a journal called Information Service four times a year, in English and French. The WCC is the broadest and most inclusive among the many organized expressions of the modern ecumenical movement. It brings together 349 churches, denominations and church fellowships in more than 100 countries and territories throughout the world, representing over 560 million Christians and including most of the world's Orthodox churches, scores of Anglican, Baptist, Lutheran, Methodist and Reformed churches, as well as many United and Independent churches. ... It describes itself as a fellowship of churches which confess the Lord Jesus Christ as God and Savior according to the Scriptures and therefore seek to fulfill together their common calling to the glory of the one God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, with the goal of visible unity in one faith and one Eucharistic fellowship, expressed in worship and in common life in Christ. ^ a b Roberson, Ronald G. (1995). Oriental Orthodox-Roman Catholic Interchurch Marriages: And Other Pastoral Relationships. USCCB Publishing. p. 81. ISBN 978-1-55586-097-4. These Churches are the Armenian Apostolic Church, the Coptic Orthodox Church, the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, the Syrian Orthodox Church, and the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church in India. In addition, an independent Orthodox Church of Eritrea was established following that country's independence from Ethiopia in 1993. All are members of the World Council of Churches and have committed themselves to the contemporary ecumenical movement. In total, there are probably about thirty million Oriental Orthodox faithful in the world today. ^ ""Member list — World Council of Churches"". World Council of Churches. 2014.

ISBN 9780140146561. From the beginning of the twentieth century the Ecumenical Patriarchate has shown a special concern for Christian reconciliation. At his accession in 1902, Patriarch Joachim III sent an encyclical letter to all the autocephalous Eastern Orthodox Churches, asking in particular for their opinion on relations with other Christian bodies. In January 1920 the Ecumenical Patriarchate followed this up with a bold and prophetic letter addressed 'To all the Churches of Christ, wherever they may be', urging closer co-operation among separated Christians, and suggesting a 'League of Churches', parallel to the newly founded League of Nations. Many of the ideas in this letter anticipate subsequent developments in the WCC. Constantinople, along with several of the other Eastern Orthodox Churches, was represented at the Faith and Order Conferences at Lausanne in 1927 and at Edinburgh in 1937. The Ecumenical Patriarchate also participated in the first Assembly of the WCC at Amsterdam in 1948, and has been a consistent supporter of the work of the WCC ever since. ^ ""WCC Assemblies 1948 - today"".

Ioan SaucaRegionInternationalOrigin1948Members350 (member churches)Official websitewww.oikoumene.org The World Council of Churches (WCC) is a worldwide Christian inter-church organization founded in 1948 to work for the cause of ecumenism.[1] Its full members today include the Assyrian Church of the East, the Oriental Orthodox Churches, most jurisdictions of the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Old Catholic Church, the Lutheran Churches, the Anglican Communion, the Mennonite Churches, the Methodist Churches, the Moravian Church and the Reformed Churches, as well as the Baptist Churches and Pentecostal Churches.[1][2][3] Notably, the Catholic Church is not a full member, although it sends delegates to meetings who have observer status.[1][4] The WCC arose out of the ecumenical movement and has as its basis the following statement: The World Council of Churches is a fellowship of churches which confess the Lord Jesus Christ as God and Savior according to the scriptures, and therefore seek to fulfill together their common calling to the glory of the one God: Father, Son and Holy Spirit. It is a community of churches on the way to visible unity in one faith and one eucharistic fellowship, expressed in worship and in common life in Christ. It seeks to advance towards this unity, as Jesus prayed for his followers, ""so that the world may believe"". (John 17:21)[5] The WCC describes itself as ""a worldwide fellowship of 349 global, regional and sub-regional, national and local churches seeking unity, a common witness and Christian service"".[6] It has no head office as such, but its administrative centre is at the Ecumenical Centre in Geneva, Switzerland.[7] The organization's members include denominations which claim to collectively represent over 500 million people across the world in more than 110 countries.[8] Many regional affiliates of the World Council of Churches, such as the Middle East Council of Churches and National Council of Churches in Australia, work for the cause of Christian unity at the domestic level, with member denominations including the Oriental Orthodox Churches, Lutheran Churches, Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Churches, Methodist Churches, Anglican Communion, Reformed Churches, among others.[9][10] Contents 1 History 2 Events and presidents 2.1 Assemblies 2.2 Presidents 2.3 General secretaries 3 Commissions and teams 3.1 Diakonia and development and international relations commissions 3.2 Faith and Order Commission 3.2.1 Texts 3.3 Justice, Peace and Creation Commission 3.4 Relations with the Roman Catholic Church 3.5 Special Commission on Orthodox Participation in the WCC 4 Peace journalism 5 Spin-offs and related organizations 6 Regional/national councils 7 Criticism 7.1 Alleged neglect of suffering church in Eastern Europe 7.2 Claims of infiltration and influence by the KGB 7.3 Attitude towards Israel 7.4 Opposition to Christian Zionism 8 See also 9 References 9.1 Citations 9.2 Sources 10 Further reading 11 External links History[edit] The Ecumenical Movement met with initial successes in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including the Edinburgh Missionary Conference of 1910 (chaired by future WCC Honorary President John R. Mott). In 1920, the Ecumenical Patriarch of the Eastern Orthodox Church, Germanus V of Constantinople, wrote a letter ""addressed 'To all the Churches of Christ, wherever they may be', urging closer co-operation among separated Christians, and suggesting a 'League of Churches', parallel to the newly founded League of Nations"".[11] Church leaders agreed in 1937 to establish a World Council of Churches, based on a merger of the Faith and Order Movement (under Charles Brent of the Episcopal Church of the United States) and Life and Work (conference)|Life and Work Movement (under Nathan Söderblom of the Lutheran Church of Sweden) organisations. Its official establishment was deferred with the outbreak of World War II until August 23, 1948. Delegates of 147 churches assembled in Amsterdam to merge the Faith and Order Movement and Life and Work Movement.[12] This was consolidated by a second meeting at Lund in 1950, for which the British Methodist Robert Newton Flew edited an influential volume of studies, The Nature of the Church.[13] Subsequent mergers were with the International Missionary Council in 1961 and the World Council of Christian Education, with its roots in the 18th century Sunday School movement, in 1971. WCC member churches include the Assyrian Church of the East and the Oriental Orthodox Churches, almost all of the Eastern Orthodox Churches and Lutheran Churches; the Moravian Church; the Anglican Communion; some Old Catholic Churches; the Methodist Churches; the Presbyterian and other Reformed Churches, a sampling of united and independent churches, and some Baptist and Pentecostal churches.[1][2] Many churches who refused to join the WCC joined to form the World Evangelical Alliance.[14] Delegates sent from the member churches meet every seven or eight years in an Assembly, which elects a Central Committee that governs between Assemblies. A variety of other committees and commissions answer to the Central Committee and its staff. Assemblies have been held since 1948. The ""human rights abuses in communist countries evoked grave concern among the leaders of the World Council of Churches.""[15] However, historian Christopher Andrew claims that, during the Cold War, a number of important WCC representatives of the Orthodox Church in Eastern Europe had been working for the KGB, and that they influenced the policy of the WCC.[16] From 1955 to 1958, Robert S. Bilheimer co-chaired a WCC international commission to prepare a document addressing the threat of nuclear warfare during the Cold War.[17] At the 1961 conference, a 32-year-old Russian Orthodox Bishop named Aleksey Ridiger was sent as delegate to the assembly, and then appointed to the WCC's central committee. He was later elected as Russian patriarch in 1990 as Alexei II.[18] The ninth assembly took place in Porto Alegre, Brazil in February 2006, under the theme ""God, in your grace, transform the world"".[19] During the first Assemblies, theologians Vasileios Ioannidis and Amilkas Alivizatos contributed significantly to the debates that led to the drafting of the ""Toronto Statement"", a foundational document which facilitated Eastern Orthodox participation in the organization and today it constitutes its ecclesiological charter.[20] The 10th Assembly was held in Busan, Republic of Korea, from 30 October to 8 November 2013.[21] In 2013 Dr. Agnes Abuom of Nairobi, from the Anglican Church of Kenya, was elected as moderator of the Central Committee of the World Council of Churches; she is the first woman and the first African to hold this position.[22] Events and presidents[edit] Assemblies[edit] The World Council of Churches has held 10 Assemblies to date, starting with the founding assembly in 1948:[23] Amsterdam, Netherlands, 22 August – 4 September 1948 Evanston, Illinois, United States, 15–31 August 1954 New Delhi, India, 19 November – 5 December 1961 Uppsala, Sweden, 4–20 July 1968 Nairobi, Kenya, 23 November – 10 December 1975 Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada 24 July – 10 August 1983 Canberra, ACT, Australia, 7–21 February 1991[24] Harare, Zimbabwe, 3–14 December 1998 Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, 14–23 February 2006 Busan, South Korea, 30 October – 8 November 2013 Presidents[edit] Presidents of the current 10th Assembly are:[25][26] Africa: Mary-Anne Plaatjies van Huffel (Uniting Reformed Church in Southern Africa) Asia: Chang Sang (Presbyterian Church in the Republic of Korea) Europe: Archbishop Anders Wejryd (Church of Sweden) Latin America and Caribbean: The Rev.

The Faith and Order Movement and Life and Work Movement represent these approaches.[29] These approaches are reflected in the work of the WCC in its commissions, these being: Echos- Commission on Youth (ages 18–30) Commission of the Churches on Diakonia and Development Commission on Education and Ecumenical Formation Commission of the Churches on International Affairs Commission on Justice, Peace and Creation Commission on World Mission and Evangelism Faith and Order Plenary Commission and the Faith and Order Standing Commission Joint Consultative Group with Pentecostals Joint Working Group WCC – Catholic Church (Vatican) Reference Group on the Decade to Overcome Violence Reference Group on Inter-Religious Relations Special Commission on Orthodox Participation in the WCC Diakonia and development and international relations commissions[edit] The WCC acts through both its member churches and other religious and social organizations to coordinate ecumenical, evangelical, and social action. Current WCC programs include a Decade to Overcome Violence, an international campaign to combat AIDS/HIV in Africa and the Justice, Peace and Creation initiative. Faith and Order Commission[edit] Main article: Faith and Order Commission WCC's Faith and Order Commission has been successful in working toward consensus on Baptism, Eucharist, and Ministry, on the date of Easter, on the nature and purpose of the church (ecclesiology), and on ecumenical hermeneutics. Texts[edit] Baptism, Eucharist and Ministry (Faith and Order Paper No. 111, the “Lima Text”; 1982)[30] The Churchː Towards a Common Vision (Faith and Order Paper no. 214; 2013[31]) after The Nature and Mission of the Church – A Stage on the Way to a Common Statement (Faith and Order Paper no. 198; 2005[32]) and The Nature and Purpose of the Church (Faith and Order Paper no. 181; 1998[33]) Towards a Common Date of Easter[34] Justice, Peace and Creation Commission[edit] Justice, Peace and Creation has drawn many elements together with an environmental focus. Its mandate is: To analyze and reflect on justice, peace and creation in their interrelatedness, to promote values and practices that make for a culture of peace, and to work towards a culture of solidarity with young people, women, Indigenous Peoples and racially and ethnically oppressed people.[35] Focal issues have been globalization and the emergence of new social movements (in terms of people bonding together in the struggle for justice, peace, and the protection of creation).[36] Attention has been given to issues around: economy[37] environment[38] Indigenous Peoples[39] peace[40] people with disabilities[41] racism[42] women[43] youth[44] Relations with the Roman Catholic Church[edit] This section does not cite any sources.

(March 2019) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The largest Christian body, the Roman Catholic Church, is not a member of the WCC, but has worked closely with the council for more than three decades and sends observers to all major WCC conferences as well as to its Central Committee meetings and the Assemblies (cf. Joint Working Group). The Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity also nominates 12 members to the WCC's Faith and Order Commission as full members. While not a member of the WCC, the Catholic Church is a member of some other ecumenical bodies at regional and national levels, for example, the National Council of Churches in Australia and the National Council of Christian Churches in Brazil (CONIC). Pope Pius XI stated in 1928, that the only means by which the world Christian community was to return to faith, was to return to Roman Catholic Worship. In this regard, the Papacy rejected, to a great extent, the idea of the participation of the Catholic Church within the World Council of Churches. Pius XI stated that the ‘One true Church’ was that of the Roman Catholic denomination, and therefore there was the implication that the Catholic Church was not permitted at this stage to engage with other denominations, which the Papacy considered to be irrelevant. The Catholic Church therefore did not attend the 1948 meeting of the WCC, in addition to the idea that all members of the church were barred from attending WCC conferences. Pope John XXIII took a different stance however, and in 1958 he was elected as the head of the Catholic Church. Ecumenism was a new element of catholic ideology which had been permitted, which was signified to a great extent, when John XXIII met with the then Archbishop of Canterbury, Geoffrey Fisher. This was the first meeting between an Archbishop of Canterbury, and the Pope in the Vatican for 600 years. John XXIII later developed the office of the Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity; which symbolised a dramatic shift in support for the ecumenical movement, from the Catholic Church, led from the Vatican. 1961 saw Catholic members attend the Delhi conference of the WCC, which marked a significant shift in attitude toward the WCC from the Papacy. There was the idea in addition to this, that the Pope invited non-Catholics to attend the Vatican II Council.[1] This new approach to inter-denominational relations was marked within the Unitatis Redintegratio. This document marked several key reforms within the Catholic approach: I.	‘Separated brethren’ was the new term for non-Catholics, as opposed to the previously used ‘heretics’[citation needed] II.	Both Catholic and non-Catholic elements are held responsible for the schism between Catholicism and the Protestant movement[citation needed] III.	Non-Catholics are recognised to the contributions that they make to Christian belief overall[citation needed] Further reforms have been enacted with regard to the nature of the Catholic Church on the world stage, for instance the 1965 union with the Patriarch of Constantinople, whereby the 1054 schism was undermined. In addition to this, Michael Ramsay, the then Archbishop of Canterbury, received an episcopal ring in 1966; a mark of union which had not been seen since prior to the Reformation. Moreover, the Anglican, Roman Catholic International Committee was additionally established as a means of promoting communication and cohesion between the two denominations. This has since marked a new level of participation of the Catholic Faith in the aforementioned ecumenical movement, and therefore is the basis for increased participation from the faith, in the WCC. Special Commission on Orthodox Participation in the WCC[edit] A Special Commission was set up by the eighth Harare Assembly in December 1998 to address Orthodox concerns about WCC membership and the council's decision-making style, public statements, worship practices, and other issues. It issued its final report in 2006.[45] Specific issues that it clarified were that the WCC does not formulate doctrine, does not have authority to rule on moral issues, nor does it have any ecclesiastical authority. Such authority is entirely internal to each individual member church. It proposed that the WCC adopt a consensus method of decision making. It proposed that Orthodox members be brought in parity with non-Orthodox members. It further proposed clarification that inter-confessional prayer at WCC events is not worship, particularly ""it should avoid giving the impression of being the worship of a church"", and confessional and inter-confessional prayer each be specifically identified as such at WCC events. Peace journalism[edit] The WCC is also a prominent supporter and practitioning body for Peace journalism: journalism practice that aims to avoid a value bias in favor of violence that often characterizes coverage of conflict.[46] Spin-offs and related organizations[edit] The ACT Alliance, bringing together over 100 church-backed relief and development organizations worldwide, was born out of the merger of ACT International (Action by Churches Together International) and ACT Development (Action by Churches Together for Development) in March 2010. Both ACT International, established in 1995, and ACT Development (2007) were created through the leadership of the World Council of Churches (WCC). The two bodies coordinated the work of agencies related to the member churches of the WCC and the Lutheran World Federation in the areas of humanitarian emergencies and poverty reduction respectively.[47] The Ecumenical Advocacy Alliance was officially founded in December 2000 at a meeting convened by the WCC. There are currently 73 churches and Christian organizations that are members of the Alliance, from Catholic, Evangelical, Orthodox and Protestant traditions. These members, representing a combined constituency of tens of millions of people around the world, are committed to working together in public witness and action for justice on defined issues of common concern. Current campaigns are on Food and on HIV and AIDS.[48] The Ecumenical Church Loan Fund (ECLOF) was founded in 1946 as one of the world's first international micro-credit institutions in the service of the poor. Willem Visser 't Hooft, then general secretary of the ""WCC in process of formation"" played an important role in founding ECLOF. It was he who sketched the prospects and challenges for the proposed institution and gave specific ideas on potential sources of funds. His inspiration and teamwork marked the beginning of a long and fruitful cooperation between ECLOF and the WCC.[49] The Ecumenical Development Cooperative Society U.A (now known as Oikocredit) was developed from discussions at the 1968 Uppsala 4th Assembly, regarding church divestment from financial institutions supporting apartheid-era South Africa and the war in Vietnam. After several years of planning, the cooperative society was founded in 1975 in the Netherlands to provide an alternative ethical investment vehicle to church institutions, by providing credit to productive enterprises serving economically disadvantaged populations. Originally organized for large institutional members of the WCC, by 1976 local congregations developed Support Associations to enable congregations as well as individuals to participate. EDCS became independent from the WCC in 1977.[50] Ecumenical News International (ENI) was launched in 1994 as a global news service reporting on ecumenical developments and other news of the churches, and giving religious perspectives on news developments worldwide. The joint sponsors of ENI, which was based at the Ecumenical Centre in Geneva, Switzerland, are the World Council of Churches, the Lutheran World Federation, the World Alliance of Reformed Churches, and the Conference of European Churches, which also have their headquarters at the Ecumenical Centre.[51] A shortage of funds led to the suspension of the work of ENI in 2012.[52] As of 2015 ENI remains closed. Regional/national councils[edit] The WCC has not sought the organic union of different Christian denominations, but it has, however, facilitated dialogue and supported local, national, and regional dialogue and cooperation. Membership in a regional or national council does not mean that the particular group is also a member of the WCC.

(May 2020) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Some historians, the U.S. State Department and former KGB officers themselves have alleged and provided corroborating evidence that the KGB's influence directly, or through lobbying by means of a front organization, the Christian Peace Conference, resulted in the WCC's failure to recognize or act on calls for help from persecuted East European Christians at the 1983 Vancouver General Assembly.[60][61]:647–8 Claims of infiltration and influence by the KGB[edit] It is claimed the KGB has infiltrated and influenced past WCC councils and policy.[16] In 1992, Father Gleb Yakunin, a vice Chairman of a Russian parliamentary commission that investigated the activities of the KGB, citing verbatim KGB reports, claimed that its Fifth Directorate was actively involved in influencing WCC policy from 1967 to 1989.[60][62] For example, in the 1983 WCC General Assembly in Vancouver, one cited document described the presence and activities of 47 KGB agents to secure the election of an ""acceptable"" candidate as General Secretary.[62][63] The Mitrokhin Archive reveals more about the depth of the penetration and influence wielded by the KGB over the WCC.[61] Metropolitan Nikidim was a KGB agent, codenamed ADAMANT, who served as one of six WCC Presidents from 1975 until his death.[61]:729[64] His earlier intervention had resulted in the WCC making no comment on the invasion of Czechoslovakia.[61]:636 As a result of his influence and that of other agents, it is claimed the USSR was rarely publicly criticised.[61]:637 In 1989, copies of the KGB documents claim ""the WCC executive and central committee adopted public statements (eight) and messages (three)"" which corresponded to its own political direction.[61]:637 Appeals from suffering dissidents both from within the Russian Orthodox Church and Protestants were ignored in 1983.[61]:647–8 Metropolitan Aleksi Ridiger of Tallinn and Estonia was repeatedly alleged to be a KGB agent codenamed DROZDOV, who in 1988 was awarded an honorary citation for services to the KGB by its chairman.[61]:650[65][66] Despite official disavowals, The Guardian described the evidence as ""compelling"".[67] In 1990 he became Alexius II, the 15th Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church. Upon his death in 2008, the WCC's official tribute, by its Council officers, described him as ""courageous"", ""supportive and constructive"" and the recipient of ""abundant blessing"", no reference was made to the allegations.[68][69] Attitude towards Israel[edit] The World Council of Churches has been described as taking an adversarial position toward the state of Israel.[70] It has also been claimed the council has focused particularly on activities and publications criticizing Israel in comparison with other human rights issues.[71][72] It is similarly claimed that it downplayed appeals from Egyptian Copts about human rights abuses under Sadat and Mubarak, in order to focus on its neighbour.[70] In 2009, the Council called for an international boycott on goods produced in Israeli settlements, which it described as 'illegal, unjust' and 'incompatible with peace'.[73] In 2013, the General Secretary was reported to claim in Cairo, ""We support the Palestinians. The WCC supports the Palestinians, because they are in the right.""[74] The WCC's Ecumenical Accompaniment Programme in Palestine and Israel (EAPPI) has been criticised by the Board of Deputies of British Jews for promoting ""an inflammatory and partisan programme at the expense of its interfaith relations"".[75] The WCC secretariat was involved in preparing and helped disseminate the Kairos Palestine Document, which declares “the Israeli occupation of Palestinian land is a sin against God and humanity because it deprives the Palestinians of their basic human rights”, and in the view of one critic, its ""authors want to see a single state"".[76] On the other hand, the WCC claims ""Antisemitism is sin against God and man"".[77] Opposition to Christian Zionism[edit] Christian Zionism, which has long represented a major thread of historic and contemporary Protestants,[78][79] is characterised as a view which ""distort(s) the interpretation of the Word of God"" and ""damage(s) intra-Christian relations"".[80] In this context, what is a source of concern is that Islamic fundamentalisms are giving rise to a counter reaction of other religious fundamentalisms, the most dangerous of which is Jewish fundamentalism which exploits the Islamic fundamentalist phenomenon to justify before western societies the distasteful aberrations of Zionism in Palestine.— WCC working paper, Lebanon, May 2013[81] Frank Chikane, moderator of the Commission of the Churches on International Affairs (CCIA) of the World Council of Churches (WCC), was criticised for using the term 'demons' to describe advocacy for Zionism in 2021.[82] See also[edit] Christian denominationsin the English-speaking world International associationsInterdenominational associations World Council of Churches World Evangelical Alliance Denominational associations Friends World Committee for Consultation Mennonite World Conference Anglican Communion Baptist World Alliance World Convention of Churches of Christ Eastern Orthodox Church Confessional Evangelical Lutheran Conference International Lutheran Council Lutheran World Federation World Methodist Council Pentecostal World Conference International Conference of Reformed Churches Reformed Ecumenical Council World Communion of Reformed Churches World Reformed Fellowship Regional associations Africa All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC) Association of Evangelicals of Africa (AEA) All Africa Baptist Fellowship Africa Lutheran Communion Asia Christian Conference of Asia (CCA) Evangelical Fellowship of Asia Asia Pacific Baptist Federation Asia Lutheran Communion Caribbean Caribbean Conference of Churches (CCC) Evangelical Association of the Caribbean Caribbean Baptist Fellowship Europe Conference of European Churches (CEC) European Evangelical Alliance European Baptist Federation Pentecostal European Fellowship Middle East Middle East Council of Churches (MECC) Latin America Latin American Council of Churches (CLAI) Latin American Evangelical Fellowship (FIDE) Union of Baptists in Latin America North America North American Baptist Fellowship Assembly of Canonical Orthodox Bishops of the United States of America North American Presbyterian and Reformed Council Pacific Pacific Conference of Churches (PCC) Evangelical Fellowship of the South Pacific (EFSP) Asia Pacific Baptist Federation AustraliaChristian denominations in Australia Australian interchurch Australian Evangelical Alliance  • website National Council of Churches Catholic Catholic Church in Australia Anglican Anglican Church of Australia Holiness and Pietist Christian and Missionary Alliance Christian Outreach Centre Church of the Nazarene Salvation Army Seventh-day Adventist Church Historical Protestantism Australian Friends Australian Baptist Ministries Open Brethren Christian Reformed Churches of Australia Churches of Christ Fellowship of Congregational Churches Lutheran Church of Australia Presbyterian Church of Australia Uniting Church in Australia Wesleyan Methodist Church of Australia Eastern Christian Antiochian Orthodox of Australia and New Z.

Since its creation, it has also established a cordial cooperation with the World Council of Churches and regularly names Catholic observers at various ecumenical gatherings and invites observers of ""fraternal delegates"" of other churches or ecclesial communities to major events of the Catholic Church. The PCPCU publishes a journal called Information Service four times a year, in English and French. The WCC is the broadest and most inclusive among the many organized expressions of the modern ecumenical movement. It brings together 349 churches, denominations and church fellowships in more than 100 countries and territories throughout the world, representing over 560 million Christians and including most of the world's Orthodox churches, scores of Anglican, Baptist, Lutheran, Methodist and Reformed churches, as well as many United and Independent churches. ... It describes itself as a fellowship of churches which confess the Lord Jesus Christ as God and Savior according to the Scriptures and therefore seek to fulfill together their common calling to the glory of the one God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, with the goal of visible unity in one faith and one Eucharistic fellowship, expressed in worship and in common life in Christ. ^ a b Roberson, Ronald G. (1995). Oriental Orthodox-Roman Catholic Interchurch Marriages: And Other Pastoral Relationships. USCCB Publishing. p. 81. ISBN 978-1-55586-097-4. These Churches are the Armenian Apostolic Church, the Coptic Orthodox Church, the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, the Syrian Orthodox Church, and the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church in India. In addition, an independent Orthodox Church of Eritrea was established following that country's independence from Ethiopia in 1993. All are members of the World Council of Churches and have committed themselves to the contemporary ecumenical movement. In total, there are probably about thirty million Oriental Orthodox faithful in the world today. ^ ""Member list — World Council of Churches"". World Council of Churches. 2014.

ISBN 9780140146561. From the beginning of the twentieth century the Ecumenical Patriarchate has shown a special concern for Christian reconciliation. At his accession in 1902, Patriarch Joachim III sent an encyclical letter to all the autocephalous Eastern Orthodox Churches, asking in particular for their opinion on relations with other Christian bodies. In January 1920 the Ecumenical Patriarchate followed this up with a bold and prophetic letter addressed 'To all the Churches of Christ, wherever they may be', urging closer co-operation among separated Christians, and suggesting a 'League of Churches', parallel to the newly founded League of Nations. Many of the ideas in this letter anticipate subsequent developments in the WCC. Constantinople, along with several of the other Eastern Orthodox Churches, was represented at the Faith and Order Conferences at Lausanne in 1927 and at Edinburgh in 1937. The Ecumenical Patriarchate also participated in the first Assembly of the WCC at Amsterdam in 1948, and has been a consistent supporter of the work of the WCC ever since. ^ ""WCC Assemblies 1948 - today"".

Dr Ioan Sauca. “Yet the threat of forced evictions and displacement continues to loom over Palestinian families in East Jerusalem. As an international community, we are called to pray and act in solidarity with our sisters and brothers in the Holy Land, and to advocate for constructive solutions for a just peace in the region,” Sauca reflects. The 20 September webinar takes place in the context of the annual World Week for Peace in Palestine and Israel, and forms part of a range of efforts made by the WCC and its Ecumenical Accompaniment Programme in Palestine and Israel (WCC-EAPPI) to advocate for just peace in the region. It also follows a recent ‘East Jerusalem Initiative’, through which the WCC has accompanied Palestinian families facing eviction and displacement through global advocacy efforts. The webinar will shed light on a range of key issues currently and historically at stake in East Jerusalem neighbourhoods such as Sheikh Jarrah, Batan al-Hawa and Silwan, and their potential consequences from a humanitarian and socio-political perspective locally as well as regionally.

Organizational structure The World Council of Churches is a fellowship of churches which confess the Lord Jesus Christ as God and Saviour according to the scriptures, and therefore seek to fulfil together their common calling to the glory of the one God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit. It is a community of churches on the way to visible unity in one faith and one eucharistic fellowship, expressed in worship and in common life in Christ. It seeks to advance towards this unity, as Jesus prayed for his followers, ""so that the world may believe."" (John 17:21) The World Council of Churches (WCC) is the broadest and most inclusive among the many organized expressions of the modern ecumenical movement, a movement whose goal is Christian unity. Video file The WCC brings together churches, denominations and church fellowships in more than 110 countries and territories throughout the world, representing over 500 million Christians and including most of the world's Orthodox churches, scores of Anglican, Baptist, Lutheran, Methodist and Reformed churches, as well as many United and Independent churches. While the bulk of the WCC's founding churches were European and North American, today most member churches are in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Latin America, the Middle East and the Pacific. There are now 349 member churches. For its member churches, the WCC is a unique space: one in which they can reflect, speak, act, worship and work together, challenge and support each other, share and debate with each other. As members of this fellowship, WCC member churches: are called to the goal of visible unity in one faith and one eucharistic fellowship; promote their common witness in work for mission and evangelism; engage in Christian service by serving human need, breaking down barriers between people, seeking justice and peace, and upholding the integrity of creation; foster renewal in unity, worship, mission and service.

Image: Shutterstock / Vitalii Vodolazskyi 02 Sep 2021 Alpen Sheth Senior Technologist, Mercy Corps Ventures UpLink - Take Action for the SDGs Take action on UpLink Forum in focus Outputs Read more about this project Explore context Science Explore the latest strategic trends, research and analysis Cryptocurrency adoption has soared during the COVID-19 pandemic, as everyone from private investors and public companies to underbanked individuals realised the benefits of digital currencies. Regulators have struggled to keep up with this growth and may limit financial inclusion by applying rules to crypto markets that are not fit for purpose. By looking to past eras of innovation, regulators can work collaboratively to adapt rules and policies to support open competition and rapid innovation in the cryptocurrency sector. Global adoption of cryptocurrencies has soared across low-, middle- and high-income countries in recent years. Regulators worldwide are still evaluating how to address the novel issues posed by digital currencies, however. The Global Future Council on Cryptocurrencies' recently published paper on navigating cryptocurrency regulation shows how past eras of innovation, such as the early days of the internet, could help meet this challenge. Here are three lessons that could support the development of crypto regulation that is fit for purpose: 1) Follow the actual drivers of cryptocurrency adoption For years, most central banks and treasury departments have focused on risk-based reporting and containment policies for virtual assets. Meanwhile, these markets have grown exponentially, with global adoption increasing by more than 2300% since 2019 and 881% in the last year alone. During this time, Bitcoin, for example, has evolved from a small niche internet community into a well-known asset for investors, private firms and even nation-states. Actual trends vary widely between geographies and are telling. Centralised and decentralised forms of finance (DeFi) are accelerating in the developed world, while peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms are driving adoption in emerging markets, like Vietnam, Kenya, Togo and Tanzania. A ranking of global adoption of cryptocurrencies, by country adjusted for power purchasing parity (PPP). Image: Chainalysis, The 2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index Many of these new users have turned to cryptocurrency to preserve their savings in the face of currency devaluation, to send and receive remittances, and for business transactions. Such transactions have grown even as central banks have banned access between banks and crypto exchanges in countries like Nigeria, while threatening the same in countries like India. Several key factors are driving interest in cryptocurrencies: ● Central bank policies, hyperinflation, and macroeconomic instability have driven volatility and devaluation of local fiat currencies relative to other global currencies before and particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. This has caused individuals and corporations such as Microstrategy, Tesla and Square to hold bitcoin and other digital monies. It has also inspired increased advocacy by users and awareness among policymakers from the US to El Salvador who are crafting new policies around cryptocurrencies. ● Remittance costs remain exorbitant for traditional payment systems at 6.8% globally and almost 9% in Sub-Saharan Africa, potentially explaining increasing P2P cryptocurrency transactions. ● The invention and rapid scaling of stablecoins as frictionless mediums of exchange between cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies. The market cap of USD Coin, for instance, has passed $25 billion with a compound annual growth rate of more than 6100%. Such traction has even inspired Sweden to pivot its planned e-krona in order to compete with such cryptocurrencies and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). ● New cryptocurrency networks such as Stellar, Algorand and Solana are gaining users by promising less energy consumption and faster transaction speeds. Layer 2 solutions, such as Lightning Network and India-based Polygon, are being added to public blockchain to extend scalability and efficiency. Such improvements are also propelling DeFi application usage. The rapid proliferation and maturation of these innovations is in large part due to the open-source architecture and global developer communities that undergird crypto networks. Much like the development of early internet protocols, the vast potential for cryptocurrency applications makes it challenging to automatically apply existing legal frameworks and definitions. —Alpen Sheth, Mercy Corps Ventures 2) Work to understand the technological significance and the many use cases for crypto Much like the development of early internet protocols, the vast potential for cryptocurrency applications makes it challenging to automatically apply existing legal frameworks and definitions ex-ante. In this context, hasty regulation will likely lead - wittingly or unwittingly - to picking winners and favouring incumbents. Even worse, it could further exacerbate a yawning digital divide within and across countries. Cryptocurrency networks provide a new paradigm for secure data and value transmission, storage and access over the internet. They offer secure, immutable storage that is resilient to single points of failure and censorship, as was recently evidenced by the use of Arweave by Hong Kong residents. Innovative new NFT gaming platforms like Axie Infinity (now worth over $1 billion) are providing stable income for the un- and underemployed in the Philippines, which makes up 40% of the user base. New software applications across sectors including DeFi, digital art and gaming (non-fungible tokens or NFTs), and non-legal entity formation (decentralised autonomous organisations or DAOs) use cryptocurrencies to embed digital rights and capabilities within tokens in a transformational way. What is the World Economic Forum doing about blockchain? Blockchain is an early-stage technology that enables the decentralized and secure storage and transfer of information and value. Though the most well-known use case is cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, which enable the electronic transfer of funds without banking networks, blockchain can be applied to a wider range of purposes. It has potential to be a powerful tool for tracking goods, data, documentation and transactions. The applications are seemingly limitless; it could cut out intermediaries, potentially reduce corruption, increase trust and empower users. In this way, blockchain could be relevant to numerous industries. That said, blockchain also entails significant trade-offs with respect to efficiency and scalability, and numerous risks that are increasingly coming to the attention of policy-makers. These include the use of cryptocurrency in ransomware attacks, fraud and illicit activity, and the energy consumption and environmental footprint of some blockchain networks. Consumer protection is also an important and often overlooked issue, with cryptocurrency, so-called “stablecoins” and decentralized applications operating on blockchain technology posing risks to end-users of lost funds and also risks to broader financial stability depending on adoption levels. Read more about the work we have launched on blockchain and distributed ledger technologies – to ensure the technology is deployed responsibly and for the benefit of all. We’re working on accelerating the most impactful blockchain use cases, ranging from making supply chains more inclusive to making governments more transparent, as well as supporting central banks in exploring digital currencies. Show To fully support the development of this new paradigm, regulators need to distinguish between the risks of centralised versus decentralised activities. For centralised exchanges and custodial financial services, cryptocurrencies pose risks congruent with financial risks that are familiar to financial authorities, capital markets regulators, consumer protection, privacy bureaus and tax authorities around the world. Regulators have highlighted the pseudonymous and borderless nature of cryptocurrency systems as potential money laundering and terrorist financing risks. Yet, illicit activity is significantly less than in the traditional financial system, comprising just 0.34% of all cryptocurrency transactions. Cryptocurrencies can enable transparency and provide an opportunity for regulators actively seeking to shift more transactions from the informal to the formal economy. —Alpen Sheth, Mercy Corps Ventures The auditability of cryptocurrencies also enhances real-time transaction monitoring, record-keeping and mitigation. Instances of money laundering can be detected and deterred, creating the evidence needed to prosecute offences. Examined from this perspective, cryptocurrencies can enable transparency and provide an opportunity for regulators actively seeking to shift more transactions from the informal to the formal economy. 3) Create more inclusive global governance Today, the differences between jurisdictions create new regulatory arbitrage opportunities as well as market uncertainty. One missing lever for global harmonisation is the lack of genuinely inclusive policy platforms. For example, global standards formulated to mitigate illicit activity have resulted in blunt derisking policies (similar to redlining) that contribute to financial exclusion, especially in Latin America, the Caribbean and Sub-Saharan Africa. Unfortunately, many developing countries in these regions are not members of some of these standard-setting bodies such as the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and Financial Action Taskforce (FATF) but are disproportionately affected by such financial rule-making. This disparity and its impact on un- and underbanked individuals living in these countries has contributed to the appeal of cryptocurrencies. Banning cryptocurrencies will not prevent adoption, it will only limit regulators’ abilities to guide market activity around these networks and address their unique potential risks. —Alpen Sheth, Mercy Corps Ventures The big challenge for regulators is that open-source cryptocurrency networks such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are computer protocols available to the public directly via the internet. They are permissionless interfaces for the issuance of tokens, self-hosted wallets and other DeFi services without the need for an intermediary. Banning cryptocurrencies will not prevent adoption, however, it will only limit regulators’ abilities to guide market activity around these networks and address their unique potential risks. Regulations informed by actual use cases and consultations with technology innovators will prove more robust in the long run and will reinforce important policy objectives driving economic inclusion, competition and growth.

The foundation, which is mostly funded by its 1,000 member companies as well as public subsidies, views its own mission as ""improving the state of the world by engaging business, political, academic, and other leaders of society to shape global, regional, and industry agendas"".[1] The WEF is mostly known for its an annual meeting at the end of January in Davos, a mountain resort in Graubünden, in the eastern Alps region of Switzerland. The meeting brings together some 3,000 paying members and selected participants – among which are business leaders, political leaders, economists, celebrities and journalists – for up to five days to discuss global issues across 500 sessions. The organization also convenes some six to eight regional meetings each year in locations across Africa, East Asia, Latin America, and India and holds two further annual meetings in China and the United Arab Emirates. Beside meetings, the organization provides a platform for leaders from selected stakeholder groups from around the world – business, government and civil society – to collaborate on multiple projects and initiatives.[2] It also produces a series of reports and engages its members in sector-specific initiatives.[3] The Forum dogmatically argues that a globalised world should be governed by a self-selected coalition of multinational corporations, governments and civil society organizations (CSOs),[4] which it expresses through initiatives like the ""Great Reset""[5] and the ""Global Redesign"".[6] The World Economic Forum and its annual meeting in Davos are criticised regarding the public cost of security while having amassed several hundred million Swiss francs in reserves and not paying federal taxes, the formation of a wealthy global elite without attachment to the broader societies, undemocratic decision processes, gender issues, a lack of financial transparency, unclear selection criteria, the environmental footprint of its annual meetings, the corporate capture of global and democratic institutions, the non-accreditation of critical media outlets and institutional whitewashing initiatives. As a reaction of criticism within the Swiss civic society, the Swiss federal government decided in February 2021 to reduce its annual contributions to the WEF.

Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman, World Economic Forum The economics expert, Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, as a World Economic Forum panelist in 2012 The WEF was founded in 1971 by Klaus Schwab, a business professor at the University of Geneva.[7] First named the European Management Forum, it changed its name to the World Economic Forum in 1987 and sought to broaden its vision to include providing a platform for resolving international conflicts. In February 1971, Schwab invited 450 executives from Western European firms to the first European Management Symposium held in the Davos Congress Centre under the patronage of the European Commission and European industrial associations, where Schwab sought to introduce European firms to American management practices.[8] He then founded the WEF as a nonprofit organization based in Geneva and drew European business leaders to Davos for the annual meetings each January.[9] The second European Management Forum, in 1972, was the first meeting at which one of the speakers at the forum was a head of government, President Pierre Werner of Luxembourg.[10] Events in 1973, including the collapse of the Bretton Woods fixed-exchange rate mechanism and the Yom Kippur War, saw the annual meeting expand its focus from management to economic and social issues, and, for the first time, political leaders were invited to the annual meeting in January 1974.[11] Political leaders soon began to use the annual meeting as venue for promoting their interests. The Davos Declaration was signed in 1988 by Greece and Turkey, helping them turn back from the brink of war. In 1992, South African President F. W. de Klerk met with Nelson Mandela and Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi at the annual meeting, their first joint appearance outside South Africa. At the 1994 annual meeting, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and PLO chairman Yasser Arafat reached a draft agreement on Gaza and Jericho.[12] In October 2004, the World Economic Forum gained attention through the resignation of its CEO[13] and executive director José María Figueres over the undeclared receipt of more than US$900,000 in consultancy fees from the French telecommunications firm Alcatel.[14] Transparency International had highlighted this incident in their Global Corruption Report in 2006.[15] In January 2006, the WEF published an article in its Global Agenda magazine titled ""Boycott Israel"", which was distributed to all 2,340 participants of the Annual Meeting.[16] Following the publication, Klaus Schwab described the publication as ""an unacceptable failure in the editorial process"".[17] In late 2015, the invitation was extended to include a North Korean delegation for the 2016 WEF, ""in view of positive signs coming out of the country"", the WEF organizers noted. North Korea has not been attending the WEF since 1998. The invitation was accepted.[18] However, WEF revoked the invitation on 13 January 2016, after the 6 January 2016 North Korean nuclear test, and the country's delegation was made to subject to ""existing and possible forthcoming sanctions"".[19][20] Despite protests by North Korea calling the decision by the WEF managing board a ""sudden and irresponsible"" move, the WEF committee maintained the exclusion because ""under these circumstances there would be no opportunity for international dialogue"".[21] In 2017, the WEF in Davos attracted considerable attention when, for the first time, a head of state from the People's Republic of China was present at the alpine resort. With the backdrop of Brexit, an incoming protectionist US administration and significant pressures on free trade zones and trade agreements, Paramount leader Xi Jinping defended the global economic scheme, and portrayed China as a responsible nation and a leader for environmental causes. He sharply rebuked the current populist movements that would introduce tariffs and hinder global commerce, warning that such protectionism could foster isolation and reduced economic opportunity.[22] In 2018, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave the plenary speech, becoming the first head of government from India to deliver the inaugural keynote for the annual meet at Davos. Modi highlighted global warming (climate change), terrorism and protectionism as the three major global challenges, and expressed confidence that they can be tackled with collective effort.[23] In 2019, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro gave the keynote address at the plenary session of the conference. On his first international trip to Davos, he emphasized liberal economic policies despite his populist agenda, and attempted to reassure the world that Brazil is a protector of the rain forest while utilizing its resources for food production and export. He stated that ""his government will seek to better integrate Brazil into the world by mainstreaming international best practices, such as those adopted and promoted by the OECD"".[24] Environmental concerns like extreme weather events, and the failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation were among the top-ranking global risks expressed by WEF attendees.[25] In 2020, the Swiss police made the public aware that two ""Russian spies"", one of whom was disguised as a plumber, had travelled to Davos with diplomatic passports prior to the Annual Meeting. The Russian Embassy in Bern denied having carried out ""preparatory work"" for spying on the World Economic Forum.[26][27] The 2021 World Economic Forum was due to be held from 17 to 20 August in Singapore.[28][29][30] However, on 17 May the Forum was cancelled; a new meeting will take place in the first half of 2022 instead with a final location and date to be determined later in 2021.[31] Organization[edit] Headquartered in Cologny, the WEF also has offices in New York, Beijing and Tokyo. In January 2015, it was designated an NGO with ""other international body"" status by the Swiss Federal Government under the Swiss Host-State Act.[32] On 10 October 2016, the WEF announced the opening of its new Center for the Fourth Industrial Revolution in San Francisco. According to the WEF, the center will ""serve as a platform for interaction, insight and impact on the scientific and technological changes that are changing the way we live, work and relate to one another"".[33] The World Economic Forum claims to be impartial and that it is not tied to any political, partisan, or national interests. Until 2012, it had observer status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council, when it was revoked; it is under the supervision of the Swiss Federal Council. The foundation's highest governance body is the foundation board.[34] The managing board is chaired by the WEF's president, Børge Brende, and acts as the executive body of the World Economic Forum. Managing board members are Børge Brende, Julien Gattoni, Jeremy Jurgens, Adrian Monck, Sarita Nayyar, Olivier M. Schwab, Saadia Zahidi, and Alois Zwinggi.[35] Recep Tayyip Erdoğan at the World Economic Forum in 2009 Board of trustees[edit] The WEF is chaired by founder and executive chairman Professor Klaus Schwab and is guided by a board of trustees that is made up of leaders from business, politics, academia and civil society. Members of the board of trustees include: Mukesh Ambani, Marc Benioff, Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, Mark Carney, Laurence D. Fink, Chrystia Freeland, Orit Gadiesh, Fabiola Gianotti, Al Gore, Herman Gref, José Ángel Gurría, André Hoffmann, Christine Lagarde, Jack Ma, Yo-Yo Ma, Peter Maurer, Luis Alberto Moreno, Muriel Pénicaud, H.M. Queen Rania Al Abdullah of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, L. Rafael Reif, David M. Rubenstein, Mark Schneider, Klaus Schwab, Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Jim Hagemann Snabe, Feike Sijbesma, Heizo Takenaka, Zhu Min.[36] Membership[edit] The foundation is funded by its 1,000 member companies, typically global enterprises with more than five billion dollars in turnover (varying by industry and region). These enterprises rank among the top companies within their industry and/or country and play a leading role in shaping the future of their industry and/or region. Membership is stratified by the level of engagement with forum activities, with the level of membership fees increasing as participation in meetings, projects, and initiatives rises.[37] In 2011 an annual membership cost $52,000 for an individual member, $263,000 for ""Industry Partner"" and $527,000 for ""Strategic Partner"". An admission fee cost $19,000 per person.[38] In 2014, WEF raised annual fees by 20 percent, bringing the cost for ""Strategic Partner"" from CHF 500,000 ($523,000) to CHF 600,000 ($628,000).[39] Activities[edit] Annual meeting in Davos[edit] A sports shop has turned into a temporary informal reception location ""Caspian week"", WEF 2018. The flagship event of the World Economic Forum is the invitation-only annual meeting held at the end of January in Davos, Switzerland, bringing together chief executive officers from its 1,000 member companies, as well as selected politicians, representatives from academia, NGOs, religious leaders, and the media in an alpine environment. The winter discussions ostensibly focus around key issues of global concern (such as the globalization, capital markets, wealth management, international conflicts, environmental problems and their possible solutions).[3][40] The participants also take part in role playing events, such as the Investment Heat Map.[41] Informal winter meetings may have led to as many ideas and solutions as the official sessions.[42] At the 2018 annual meeting, more than 3,000 participants from nearly 110 countries participated in over 400 sessions. Participation included more than 340 public figures, including more than 70 heads of state and government and 45 heads of international organizations; 230 media representatives and almost 40 cultural leaders were represented.[43] As many as 500 journalists from online, print, radio, and television take part, with access to all sessions in the official program, some of which are also webcast.[44] Not all the journalists are given access to all areas, however. This is reserved for white badge holders. ""Davos runs an almost caste-like system of badges"", according to BBC journalist Anthony Reuben. ""A white badge means you're one of the delegates – you might be the chief executive of a company or the leader of a country (although that would also get you a little holographic sticker to add to your badge), or a senior journalist. An orange badge means you're just a run-of-the-mill working journalist.""[45] All plenary debates from the annual meeting also are available on YouTube[46] while photographs are available on Flickr.[47][48] Overview of past annual meetings Year Dates Theme 1988 The new state of the world economy 1989 Key developments in the 90s: implications for global business 1990 Competitive cooperation in a decade of turbulence 1991 The new direction for global leadership 1992 Global cooperation and megacompetition 1993 Rallying all the forces for global recovery 1994 Redefining the basic assumptions of the world economy 1995 Leadership for challenges beyond growth 1996 Sustaining globalization 1997 Building the network society 1998 Managing volatility and priorities for the 21st century 1999 Responsible globality: managing the impact of globalization 2000 New beginnings: making a difference 2001 25–30 January Sustaining growth and bridging the divides: a framework for our global future 2002 31 January – 4 February Leadership in fragile times (Held in New York instead) 2003 21–25 January Building trust 2004 21–25 January Partnering for security and prosperity 2005 26–30 January Taking responsibility for tough choices 2006 25–29 January The creative imperative[49] 2007 24–28 January Shaping the global agenda, the shifting power equation 2008 23–27 January The power of collaborative innovation 2009 28 January – 1 February Shaping the post-crisis world 2010 27–30 January Improve the state of the world: rethink, redesign, rebuild 2011 26–30 January Shared norms for the new reality 2012 25–29 January The great transformation: shaping new models 2013 23–27 January Resilient dynamism[50] 2014 22–25 January The reshaping of the world: consequences for society, politics and business 2015 21–24 January New global context 2016 20–23 January Mastering the fourth industrial revolution 2017 17–20 January Responsive and responsible leadership 2018 23–26 January Creating a shared future in a fractured world 2019 22–25 January Globalization 4.0: shaping a global architecture in the age of the fourth industrial revolution 2020 20–24 January Stakeholders for a cohesive and sustainable world[51] 2021 17–20 August TBD (to be held in Singapore instead of Davos as a result of COVID-19 pandemic) Individual participants[edit] Juan Manuel Santos, President of Colombia, at the 2010 World Economic Forum Some 3,000 individual participants joined the 2020 annual meeting in Davos. Countries with the most attendees include the United States (674 participants), the United Kingdom (270), Switzerland (159), Germany (137) and India (133).[52] Among the attendees were heads of state or government, cabinet ministers, ambassadors, heads or senior officials of international organizations) attended the annual meeting, including: Sanna Marin (prime minister of Finland), Ursula von der Leyen (president of the European Commission), Christine Lagarde (ECB president), Greta Thunberg (climate activist), Ren Zhengfei (Huawei Technologies founder), Kristalina Georgieva (managing director of the IMF), Deepika Padukone (Bollywood actress), George Soros (investor) and Donald Trump (president of the United States).[53] An analysis by The Economist from 2014 found that the vast majority of participants are male and more than 50 years old. Business accounts for most of the participants' background (1,595 conference attendees) with the remaining seats shared between government (364), NGOs (246) and press (234). Academia, which had been the basis of the first annual conference in 1971, had been marginalised to the smallest participant group (183 attendees).[54] Corporate participants[edit] Next to individual participants, the World Economic Forum maintains a dense network of corporate partners that can apply for different partnership ranks within the forum.[55] For 2019, Bloomberg has identified a total of 436 listed corporates that participated in the Annual Meeting while measuring a stock underperformance by the Davos participants of around -10% versus the S&P 500 during the same year. Drivers are among others an overrepresentation of financial companies and an underrepresentation of fast-growing health care and information technology businesses at the conference.[56] The Economist had found similar results in an earlier study, showing an underperformance of Davos participants against both the MSCI World Index and the S&P 500 between 2009 and 2014.[54] Summer annual meeting[edit] Wang Jianlin, Chairman of the Dalian Wanda Group, at the 2009 Annual Meeting of the New Champions in Dalian In 2007, the foundation established the Annual Meeting of the New Champions (also called Summer Davos), held annually in China, alternating between Dalian and Tianjin, bringing together 1,500 participants from what the foundation calls Global Growth Companies, primarily from rapidly growing emerging countries such as China, India, Russia, Mexico, and Brazil, but also including quickly growing companies from developed countries. The meeting also engages with the next generation of global leaders from fast-growing regions and competitive cities, as well as technology pioneers from around the globe.[57][58] The Premier of China has delivered a plenary address at each annual meeting. Regional meetings[edit] Prithviraj Chavan, chief minister of Maharashtra, India; Sudha Pilay, member-secretary, Planning Commission, India; and Ben Verwaayen, chief executive officer, Alcatel-Lucent, France, were the co-chairs of the India Economic Summit 2011 in Mumbai. Felipe Calderón, President of Mexico, speaking during Latin America Broadens Its Horizons, a session at the 2007 annual meeting of the World Economic Forum Every year regional meetings take place, enabling close contact among corporate business leaders, local government leaders, and NGOs. Meetings are held in Africa, East Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East. The mix of hosting countries varies from year to year, but consistently China and India have hosted throughout the decade since 2000.[59] Young Global Leaders[edit] The group of Young Global Leaders[60] consists of 800 people chosen by the WEF organizers as being representative of contemporary leadership, ""coming from all regions of the world and representing all stakeholders in society"", according to the organization. After five years of participation they are considered alumni. Social entrepreneurs[edit] Since 2000, the WEF has been promoting models developed by those in close collaboration with the Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship,[61] highlighting social entrepreneurship as a key element to advance societies and address social problems.[62][63] Selected social entrepreneurs are invited to participate in the foundation's regional meetings and the annual meetings where they may meet chief executives and senior government officials. At the Annual Meeting 2003, for example, Jeroo Billimoria met with Roberto Blois, deputy secretary-general of the International Telecommunication Union, an encounter that produced a key partnership for her organization Child helpline international.[64] Research reports[edit] Two-time Academy Award winner, Pakistani journalist Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy at WEF in 2013 The foundation also acts as a think tank, publishing a wide range of reports. In particular, ""Strategic Insight Teams"" focus on producing reports of relevance in the fields of competitiveness, global risks, and scenario thinking. Filipino businessman Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala at WEF in 2009 The ""Competitiveness Team""[65] produces a range of annual economic reports (first published in brackets): the Global Competitiveness Report (1979) measured competitiveness of countries and economies; The Global Information Technology Report (2001) assessed their competitiveness based on their IT readiness; the Global Gender Gap Report examined critical areas of inequality between men and women; the Global Risks Report (2006) assessed key global risks; the Global Travel and Tourism Report (2007) measured travel and tourism competitiveness; the Financial Development Report (2008)[66] aimed to provide a comprehensive means for countries to establish benchmarks for various aspects of their financial systems and establish priorities for improvement; and the Global Enabling Trade Report (2008) presented a cross-country analysis of the large number of measures facilitating trade among nations.[67] The ""Risk Response Network""[68] produces a yearly report assessing risks which are deemed to be within the scope of these teams, have cross-industry relevance, are uncertain, have the potential to cause upwards of US$10 billion in economic damage, have the potential to cause major human suffering, and which require a multi-stakeholder approach for mitigation.[69] In 2020, the forum published a report named: ""Nature Risk Rising"". In this report the forum estimated that approximately half of the global GDP is dependent highly or moderately on nature and 1 dollar spent on nature restoration yields 9 dollars in profit.[70][71] Initiatives[edit] Health[edit] The Global Health Initiative was launched by Kofi Annan at the annual meeting in 2002. The GHI's mission was to engage businesses in public-private partnerships to tackle HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and health systems. Mohammad Khatami at Economic Forum in 2004 The Global Education Initiative (GEI), launched during the annual meeting in 2003, brought together international IT companies and governments in Jordan, Egypt, and India[72] that has resulted in new personal computer hardware being available in their classrooms and more local teachers trained in e-learning. The GEI model, which is scalable and sustainable, now is being used as an educational blueprint in other countries including Rwanda. On 19 January 2017 the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a global initiative to fight epidemics, was launched at WEF in Davos. The internationally funded initiative aims at securing vaccine supplies for global emergencies and pandemics, and to research new vaccines for tropical diseases, that are now more menacing. The project is funded by private and governmental donors, with an initial investment of US$460m from the governments of Germany, Japan and Norway, plus the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust.[73] 2020 meeting[edit] Between 21 and 24 January 2020, at the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, CEPI met with leaders from Moderna to establish plans for a COVID-19 vaccine at the Davos gathering,[74] with a total global case number of 274 and total loss of life the virus at 16.[75] The WHO declared a global health emergency 6 days later.[76] Society[edit] The Water Initiative brings together diverse stakeholders such as Alcan Inc., the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, USAID India, UNDP India, Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Government of Rajasthan, and the NEPAD Business Foundation to develop public-private partnerships on water management in South Africa and India. In an effort to combat corruption, the Partnering Against Corruption Initiative (PACI) was launched by CEOs from the engineering and construction, energy and metals, and mining industries at the annual meeting in Davos during January 2004. PACI is a platform for peer exchange on practical experience and dilemma situations. Approximately 140 companies have joined the initiative.[77] Environment[edit] Further information: Business action on climate change In the beginning of the 21st century, the forum began to increasingly deal with environmental issues.[78] In the Davos Manifesto 2020 it is said that a company among other: ""acts as a steward of the environmental and material universe for future generations. It consciously protects our biosphere and champions a circular, shared and regenerative economy."" ""responsibly manages near-term, medium-term and long-term value creation in pursuit of sustainable shareholder returns that do not sacrifice the future for the present."" ""is more than an economic unit generating wealth. It fulfils human and societal aspirations as part of the broader social system. Performance must be measured not only on the return to shareholders, but also on how it achieves its environmental, social and good governance objectives.""[79] The Environmental Initiative covers climate change and water issues. Under the Gleneagles Dialogue on Climate Change, the U.K. government asked the World Economic Forum at the G8 Summit in Gleneagles in 2005 to facilitate a dialogue with the business community to develop recommendations for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This set of recommendations, endorsed by a global group of CEOs, was presented to leaders ahead of the G8 Summit in Toyako, Hokkaido, Japan held in July 2008.[80][81] In 2016 WEF published an article in which it is said, that in some cases reducing consumption can increase well-being. In the article is mentioned that in Costa Rica the GDP is 4 times smaller than in many countries in Western Europe and North America, but people live longer and better. An American study shows that those whose income is higher than $75,000, do not necessarily have an increase in well-being. To better measure well-being, the New Economics Foundation's launched the Happy Planet Index.[82] In January 2017, WEF launched the 'Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy' (PACE), which is a global public private partnership seeking to scale circular economy innovations.[83][84] PACE is co-chaired by Frans van Houten (CEO of Philips), Naoko Ishii (CEO of the Global Environment Facility, and the head of United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).[85] The Ellen MacArthur Foundation, the International Resource Panel, Circle Economy and Accenture serve as knowledge partners. The Forum emphasized its 'Environment and Natural Resource Security Initiative' for the 2017 meeting to achieve inclusive economic growth and sustainable practices for global industries. With increasing limitations on world trade through national interests and trade barriers, the WEF has moved towards a more sensitive and socially-minded approach for global businesses with a focus on the reduction of carbon emissions in China and other large industrial nations.[86] Also in 2017, WEF launched the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) for the Earth Initiative, a collaboration among WEF, Stanford University and PwC, and funded through the Mava Foundation.[87] In 2018, WEF announced that one project within this initiative was to be the Earth BioGenome Project, the aim of which is to sequence the genomes of every organism on Earth.[88] The World Economic Forum is working to eliminate plastic pollution, stating that by the year 2050 it will consume 15% of the global carbon budget and will pass by its weight fishes in the world's oceans. One of the methods is to achieve circular economy.[89][90] The theme of the 2020 World Economic Forum annual meeting was 'Stakeholders for a Cohesive and Sustainable World'. Climate change and sustainability were central themes of discussion. Many argued that GDP is failed to represent correctly the wellbeing and that fossil fuel subsidies should be stopped. Many of the participants said that a better capitalism is needed. Al Gore summarized the ideas in the conference as: ""The version of capitalism we have today in our world must be reformed"".[91] In this meeting the World Economic Forum: Launched the Trillion Tree Campaign an initiative aiming to ""grow, restore and conserve 1 trillion trees over the next 10 years around the world - in a bid to restore biodiversity and help fight climate change"". Donald Trump joined the initiative. The forum stated that: ""Nature-based solutions – locking-up carbon in the world’s forests, grasslands and wetlands – can provide up to one-third of the emissions reductions required by 2030 to meet the Paris Agreement targets,"" adding that the rest should come from the heavy industry, finance and transportation sectors. One of the targets is to unify existing reforestation projects[92] Discussed the issue of climate change and called to expanding renewable energy, energy efficiency change the patterns of consumption and remove carbon from the atmosphere. The forum claimed that the climate crisis will become a climate apocalypse if the temperature will rise by 2 degrees. The forum called to fulfill the commitments in Paris Agreement. Jennifer Morgan, the executive director of Greenpeace, said that as to the beginning of the forum, fossil fuels still get three times more money than climate solutions.[93] At the 2021 annual meeting UNFCCC launched the 'UN Race-to-Zero Emissions Breakthroughs'. The aim of the campaign is to transform 20 sectors of the economy in order to achieve zero greenhouse gas emissions. At least 20% of each sector should take specific measures, and 10 sectors should be transformed before COP 26 in Glasgow. According to the organizers, 20% is a tipping point, after which the whole sector begins to irreversibly change.[94][95] Coronavirus and green recovery[edit] In April 2020, the forum published an article that postulates that the COVID-19 pandemic is linked to the destruction of nature. The number of emerging diseases is rising and this rise is linked to deforestation and species loss. In the article, there are multiple examples of the degradation of ecological systems caused by humans. It is also says that half of the global GDP is moderately or largely dependent on nature. The article concludes that the recovery from the pandemic should be linked to nature recovery.[70] The forum proposed a plan for a green recovery. The plan includes advancing circular economy. Among the mentioned methods, there is green building, sustainable transport, organic farming, urban open space, renewable energy and electric vehicles.[96] Global Future Councils[edit] The Network of Global Future Councils meets annually in the United Arab Emirates and virtually several times a year.[97] The second WEF annual meeting was held in Dubai in November 2017, when there were 35 distinct councils focused on a specific issue, industry or technology.[98] In 2017 members met with representatives and partners of WEF's new Center for the Fourth Industrial Revolution.[99] Ideas and proposals are taken forward for further discussion at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos-Klosters in January.[98] Global Shapers Community[edit] The Global Shapers Community, an initiative of World Economic Forum, selects young leaders below 30 years old based on their achievement and potential to be change agents in the world.[100] Global Shapers develop and lead their city-based hubs to implement social justice projects that advance the mission of World Economic Forum. Future of Work[edit] In regards to the Future of Work, the 2020 WEF set the goal of providing better jobs, access to higher quality education and skills to 1 billion people by 2030.[101] The Great Reset[edit] Main article: The Great Reset In May 2020, the WEF and the Prince of Wales's Sustainable Markets Initiative launched ""The Great Reset"" project, a five-point plan concerned with enhancing sustainable economic growth following the global recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns.[102] ""The Great Reset"" will be the theme of WEF's Annual Meeting in August 2021.[103] According to the Founder and Executive Chairman, of the forum, Klaus Schwab, the meaning of the project is to reconsider the meaning of capitalism and capital. While not abandoning capitalism, he proposes to change and possibly move on from some aspects of it including Neoliberalism, and Free-market fundamentalism. The role of corporations, taxation and more should be reconsidered. International cooperation and trade should be defended and the Fourth Industrial Revolution also.[104][105] Criticism[edit] This section may lend undue weight to certain ideas, incidents, or controversies. Please help improve it by rewriting it in a balanced fashion that contextualizes different points of view. (November 2020) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Physical protests[edit] Protest march against the WEF in Basel, 2006 During the late 1990s, the WEF, along with the G7, World Bank, World Trade Organization, and International Monetary Fund, came under heavy criticism by anti-globalization activists who claimed that capitalism and globalization were increasing poverty and destroying the environment. About ten thousand demonstrators disrupted a regional meeting of the World Economic Forum in Melbourne, obstructing the path of two hundred delegates to the meeting.[106] Small demonstrations are held in Davos on most but not all years, organised by the local Green Party (see Anti-WEF protests in Switzerland, January 2003) to protest against what have been called the meetings of ""fat cats in the snow"", a tongue-in-cheek term used by rock singer Bono.[107] After 2014, the physical protest movement against the World Economic Forum largely died down, and Swiss police noted a significant decline in attending protesters, 20 at most during the meeting in 2016. While protesters are still more numerous in large Swiss cities, the protest movement itself has undergone significant change.[108] Around 150 Tibetans and Uighurs protested in Geneva and 400 Tibetans in Bern against the visit of China's paramount leader Xi Jinping for the 2017 meeting, with subsequent confrontations and arrests.[109] Growing gaps in wealth[edit] A number of NGOs have used the World Economic Forum to highlight growing inequalities and wealth gaps, which they consider not to be addressed extensively enough or even to be fortified through institutions like the WEF. Winnie Byanyima, the executive director of the anti-poverty confederation Oxfam International co-chaired the 2015 meeting, where she presented a critical report of global wealth distribution based on statistical research by the Credit Suisse Research Institute. In this study, the richest one percent of people in the world own forty-eight percent of the world's wealth.[110] At the 2019 meeting, she presented another report claiming that the gap between rich and poor has only increased. The report ""Public Good or Private Wealth"" stated that 2,200 billionaires worldwide saw their wealth grow by 12 percent while the poorest half saw its wealth fall by 11 percent. Oxfam calls for a global tax overhaul to increase and harmonise global tax rates for corporations and wealthy individuals.[111] Formation of a detached elite[edit] The formation of a detached elite, which is often co-labelled through the neologism ""Davos Man"", refers to a global group whose members view themselves as completely ""international"". The term refers to people who ""have little need for national loyalty, view national boundaries as obstacles that thankfully are vanishing, and see national governments as residues from the past whose only useful function is to facilitate the élite's global operations"" according to political scientist Samuel P. Huntington, who is credited with inventing the neologism.[112] In his 2004 article ""Dead Souls: The Denationalization of the American Elite"", Huntington argues that this international perspective is a minority elitist position not shared by the nationalist majority of the people.[113] The Transnational Institute describes the World Economic Forum's main purpose as being ""to function as a socializing institution for the emerging global elite, globalization's ""Mafiocracy"" of bankers, industrialists, oligarchs, technocrats and politicians. They promote common ideas, and serve common interests: their own.""[114] In 2019, the Manager Magazin journalist Henrik Müller argued that the ""Davos Man"" had already decayed into different groups and camps. He sees three central drivers for this development:[115] Ideologically: the liberal western model is no longer considered a universal role model that other countries strive for (with China's digital totalitarianism or the traditional absolutism in the Persian Gulf as counter-proposals, all of which are represented by government members in Davos). Socially: societies increasingly disintegrate into different groups, each of which evokes its own identity (e.g. embodied through the Brexit vote or congressional blockades in the USA). Economically: the measured economic reality largely contradicts the established ideas of how the economy should actually work (despite economic upswings, wages and prices e.g. barely rise). Public cost of security[edit] The Swiss Civil Defense Police during the 2013 Annual Meeting in Davos Critics argue that the WEF, despite having reserves of several hundred million Swiss francs and paying its executives salaries of around 1 million Swiss francs per year, would not pay any federal tax and moreover allocate a part of its costs to the public.[116] Following massive criticism from politicians and the Swiss civil society, the Swiss federal government decided in February 2021 to reduce its annual contributions to the WEF.[117] As of 2018, the police and military expenditures carried by the Federal Government stood at 39 million Swiss francs.[118] The Aargauer Zeitung argued in January 2020 that the additional cost borne by the Kanton Graubünden stand at CHF 9 million per year.[119] The Swiss Green Party summarised their criticism within the Swiss National Council that the holding of the World Economic Forum has cost Swiss taxpayers hundreds of millions of Swiss francs over the past decades. In their view, it was however questionable to what extent the Swiss population or global community benefit from these expenditures.[120] Gender debate[edit] Further information: Gender bias Females have been broadly underrepresented at the WEF, according to some critics. The female participation rate at the WEF increased from 9% to 15% between 2001 and 2005. In 2016, 18% of the WEF attendees were female; this number increased to 21% in 2017, and 24% in 2020.[121][122] Several women have since shared their personal impressions of the Davos meetings in media articles, highlighting that issues were more profound than ""a quota at Davos for female leaders or a session on diversity and inclusion"".[123][124][125] The World Economic Forum has in this context filed legal complaints against at least three investigative articles by reporters Katie Gibbons and Billy Kenber that were published by the British newspaper The Times in March 2020.[126][127][128][129] Undemocratic decision making[edit] According to the European Parliament's Think Tank, critics see the WEF as an instrument for political and business leaders to ""take decisions without having to account to their electorate or shareholders"".[130] Since 2009, the WEF has been working on a project called the Global Redesign Initiative (GRI), which proposes a transition away from intergovernmental decision-making towards a system of multi-stakeholder governance. According to the Transnational Institute (TNI), the Forum is hence planning to replace a recognised democratic model with a model where a self-selected group of ‘stakeholders’ make decisions on behalf of the people.[131] The German Cicero magazine summarised the situation that academic, cultural, media and economic elites are grasping for social power while disregarding political decision processes. A materially well-endowed milieu would in this context try to ""cement its dominance of opinion and sedate ordinary people with maternalistic-paternalistic social benefits, so that they are not disturbed by the common people when they steer"".[132] The French Les Echos furthermore concludes that Davos ""represents the exact values people rejected at the ballot box"".[133] Lack of financial transparency[edit] Further information: Financial transparency In 2017, the former Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung journalist Jürgen Dunsch criticized that financial reports of the WEF were not very transparent since neither income nor expenditures were broken down. In addition, he outlined that the foundation capital was not quantified while the apparently not insignificant profits would be reinvested.[134] Recent annual reports published by the WEF include a more detailed breakdown of its financials and indicate revenues of CHF 349 million for the year 2019 with reserves of CHF 310 million and a foundation capital of CHF 34 million. There are no further details provided to what asset classes or individual names the WEF allocates its financial assets of CHF 261 million.[135] The German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung criticised in this context that the WEF had turned into a ""money printing machine"", which is run like a family business and forms a comfortable way to make a living for its key personnel. The foundation's founder Klaus Schwab draws a salary of around one million Swiss francs per year.[134] Unclear selection criteria[edit] In a request to the Swiss National Council, the Swiss Green Party criticised that invitations to the annual meeting and programmes of the World Economic Forum are issued according to unclear criteria. They highlight that ""despots"" such as the son of the former Libyan dictator Saif al-Islam al-Gaddafi had been invited to the WEF and even awarded membership in the club of ""Young Global Leaders"".[120] Even after the beginning of the Arab spring in December 2010 and related violent uprisings against despot regimes, the WEF continued to invite Gaddafi to its annual meeting.[136] Environmental footprint of annual meetings[edit] Critics emphasise that the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum is counterproductive when combating pressing problems of humanity such as the climate crisis. Even in 2020, participants travelled to the WEF annual meeting in Davos on around 1,300 private jets while the total emissions burden from transport and accommodation were enormous in their view.[137][120] Corporate capture of global and democratic institutions[edit] The World Economic Forum's ""Global Redesign"" report suggests to create ""public-private"" United Nations (UN) in which selected agencies operate and steer global agendas under shared governance systems.[4] It demands that a globalised world should be governed by a coalition of multinational corporations, governments and selected civil society organizations (CSOs) instead of classical democratic structures[138] as democratic governments are no longer ""the overwhelmingly dominant actors on the world stage"" and that the time has come for a new international governance. In September 2019, more than 400 civil society organizations and 40 international networks heavily criticised a partnership agreement between WEF and the United Nations and called on the UN Secretary-General to end it.[139] They see such an agreement as a ""disturbing corporate capture of the UN, which moved the world dangerously towards a privatised global governance"".[140] The Dutch Transnational Institute think tank summarises that we are increasingly entering a world where gatherings such as Davos are ""a silent global coup d'etat"" to capture governance.[131] Non-accreditation of critical media outlets[edit] In 2019, the Swiss newspaper WOZ received a refusal of its accreditation request for the Annual Meeting with the editors and subsequently accused the World Economic Forum of favoring specific media outlets. The newspaper highlighted that the WEF stated in its refusal message that it [the Forum] prefers media outlets it works with throughout the year. WOZ deputy head Yves Wegelin called this a strange idea of journalism because in ""journalism you don't necessarily have to work with large corporations, but rather critique them"".[141] Michael Burkard, secretary general of the Swiss journalists' professional association ""Impressum"", criticised the WEF's decision as ""highly disturbing"". He sees the risk that other companies operating in exposed areas will copy this strategy and deny critical journalists access to their general meetings or other information events, should the WEF get away with this strategy.[citation needed] Institutional whitewashing initiatives[edit] In a December 2020 article by The Intercept, author Naomi Klein described that the WEF's initiatives like the ""Great Reset"" were simply a ""coronavirus-themed rebranding"" of things that the WEF was already doing and that it was an attempt by the rich to make themselves look good. She concludes that the Great Reset was merely the latest edition of this gilded tradition, barely distinguishable from earlier Davos Big Ideas.[142] Similarly, in his review of COVID-19: The Great Reset, ethicist Steven Umbrello makes parallel critiques of the agenda. He says that the WEF ""whitewash[es] a seemingly optimistic future post-Great Reset with buzz words like equity and sustainability"" while it functionally jeopardizes those goals.[143] A study published in the Journal of Consumer Research investigated the sociological impact of the WEF. It concluded that the WEF do not solve issues such as poverty, global warming, chronic illness, or debt. They have simply shifted the burden for the solution of these problems from governments and business to ""responsible consumers subjects: the green consumer, the health-conscious consumer, and the financially literate consumer.""[144] Controversies[edit] Controversy with Davos municipality[edit] In June 2021, WEF founder Klaus Schwab sharply criticised the ""profiteering"", ""complacency"" and ""lack of commitment"" by the municipality of Davos in relation to the annual meeting. He mentioned that the preparation of the COVID-related meeting in Singapore in 2021/2022[145] had created an alternative to its Swiss host and sees the chance that the annual meeting will stay in Davos between 40 and 70 per cent.[146][147] Controversy on usage of Davos name[edit] As there are many other international conferences nicknamed with ""Davos"",[148] the World Economic Forum objected the use of ""Davos"" in such contexts for any event not organised by them.[149][150][151][148] This particular statement was issued on 22 October 2018, a day before the opening of 2018 Future Investment Initiative (nicknamed ""Davos in the desert"") organised by the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia.[150][151][148] Alternatives[edit] Open Forum Davos[edit] Since the annual meeting in January 2003 in Davos, an Open Forum Davos,[152] which was co-organized by the Federation of Swiss Protestant Churches, is held concurrently with the Davos forum, opening up the debate about globalization to the general public. The Open Forum has been held in the local high school every year, featuring top politicians and business leaders. It is open to all members of the public free of charge.[153][154] Public Eye Awards[edit] The Public Eye Awards have been held every year since 2000. It is a counter-event to the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos. Public Eye Awards is a public competition of the worst corporations in the world. In 2011, more than 50,000 people voted for companies that acted irresponsibly. At a ceremony at a Davos hotel, the ""winners"" in 2011 were named as Indonesian palm oil diesel maker, Neste Oil in Finland, and mining company AngloGold Ashanti in South Africa.[155] According to Schweiz aktuell broadcast on 16 January 2015, a public presence during the WEF 2015, may not be guaranteed because the massively increased security in Davos. The Public Eye Award will be awarded for the last time in Davos: Public Eyes says Goodbye to Davos, confirmed by Rolf Marugg (now Landrats politician), by not directly engaged politicians, and by the police responsible.[156] See also[edit] Event 201 World Youth Forum 2009 Davos incident Asian Leadership Conference Boao Forum for Asia Davos process Eurofi European Business Summit Horasis International Transport Forum Istanbul World Political Forum St. Petersburg International Economic Forum World Knowledge Forum References[edit] ^ ""Our Mission"".

Its mission is 'To promote the sustainable supply and use of energy for the greatest benefit of all people'. The idea for the foundation of the Council came from Daniel Nicol Dunlop in the 1920s. He wanted to gather experts from all around the world to discuss current and future energy issues. He organised in 1923 first national committees, which organised the first World Power Conference (WPC) in 1924. 1,700 experts from 40 countries met in London to discuss energy issues. The meeting was a success and the participants decided on July 11, 1924 to establish a permanent organisation named World Power Conference. Dunlop was elected as its first Secretary General.[1] In 1968 the name was changed to World Energy Conference, and in 1989 it became the World Energy Council.[2] The World Energy Council is the principal impartial network of leaders and practitioners promoting an affordable, stable and environmentally sensitive energy system for the greatest benefit of all. Formed in 1923, the Council is the UN-accredited[3] global energy body, representing the entire energy spectrum, with more than 3,000 member organisations located in over 90 countries and drawn from governments, private and state corporations, academia, NGOs and energy-related stakeholders. The World Energy Council informs global, regional and national energy strategies by hosting high-level events, publishing authoritative studies, and working through its extensive member network to facilitate the world’s energy policy dialogue. Today, the Council has Member Committees established in over 90 countries, which represent over 3,000 member organizations including governments, industry and expert institutions. The World Energy Council covers all energy resources and technologies of energy supply and demand.[4] The World Energy Council hosts the World Energy Congress, which is the world's largest and most influential energy event covering all aspects of the energy agenda. Staged every three years, the Congress provides a platform for energy leaders and experts in all aspects of the sector to address the challenges and opportunities facing suppliers and consumers of energy. The 2019 edition took place in Abu Dhabi from 9–12 September, where it was announced that Saint Petersburg will be the host city for the next World Energy Congress in 2022.[5] The World Energy Council's publications include annual releases like the World Energy Trilemma Index, which compares Energy security, equity and environmental sustainability on a country-by-country basis [6] (also available as an online tool[7]), as well as Insights Briefs on current energy topics such as Blockchain.[8] Contents 1 Member Committees 2 World Energy Congresses[11] 3 Chairs 4 Secretaries General 5 Officers 6 See also 7 References 8 External links Member Committees[edit] As of March 2019 the World Energy Council has 87 member committees and 2 countries which have direct membership[9][10] Algeria Argentina Armenia Austria Bahrain Belgium Bolivia Bosnia Botswana Brazil Bulgaria Cameroon Canada Chad Chile China Colombia Côte d’Ivoire Croatia Cyprus DR Congo Dominican Republic Ecuador Egypt Estonia eSwatini Ethiopia Finland France Germany Greece Hong Kong, China Hungary Iceland India Indonesia Iran Ireland Italy Japan Jordan Kazakhstan Kenya Korea Latvia Lebanon Libya Lithuania Malaysia Malta Mexico Monaco Mongolia Morocco Namibia Nepal Netherlands New Zealand Niger Nigeria Pakistan Panama Paraguay Poland Portugal Romania Russian Federation Saudi Arabia Senegal Serbia Singapore Slovakia Slovenia South Africa Spain Sri Lanka Sweden Switzerland Syria Tanzania Thailand Trinidad & Tobago Tunisia Turkey Ukraine United Arab Emirates United States Uruguay World Energy Congresses[11][edit] London, 1924 Berlin, 1930 Washington, 1936 London, 1950 Vienna, 1956 Melbourne, 1962 Moscow, 1968 Bukarest, 1971 Detroit, 1974 Istanbul, 1977 Munich, 1980 New Delhi, 1983 Cannes, 1986 Montreal, 1989 Madrid, 1992 Tokyo, 1995 Houston, 1998 Buenos Aires, 2001 Sydney, 2004 Rome, 2007 Montreal, 2010 Daegu, 2013 Istanbul, 2016 Abu Dhabi, 2019 Chairs[edit] 1995–1998: John Baker 1998–2001: Jim Adam 2001–2004: Antonio del Rosario 2004–2007: André Caillé 2007–2013: Pierre Gadonneix 2013–2016: Marie-José Nadeau 2016–2019: Younghoon David Kim 2019–present: Jean-Marie Dauger Secretaries General[edit] 1924–1928: Daniel Nicol Dunlop 1928–1966: Charles Gray 1966–1986: Eric Ruttley 1986–1998: Ian Lindsay 1998–2008: Gerald Doucet 2008–2009: Kieran O'Brian (acting) 2009–2019: Christoph Frei 2019–present: Angela Wilkinson Officers[edit] JEAN-MARIE DAUGER, Chair LEONHARD BIRNBAUM, Chair – Studies Committee IBRAHIM AL-MUHANNA, Vice Chair – Special Responsibility Gulf States & Middle East MATAR AL NEYADI, Vice Chair – UAE Organizing Committee, World Energy Congress 2019, Abu Dhabi MIKE HOWARD, Vice Chair – Special Responsibility for Innovation KLAUS-DIETER BARBKNECHT, Vice Chair – Finance ALEXANDRE PERRA, Vice Chair – Europe OLEG BUDARGIN, Vice Chair – Responsibility for Regional Development JOSÉ DA COSTA CARVALHO NETO, Chair – Programme Committee CLAUDIA CRONENBOLD, Vice Chair – Latin America&Caribbean ROBERT HANF, Vice Chair – North America ELHAM IBRAHIM, Vice Chair – Africa SHIGERU MURAKI, Vice Chair – Asia Pacific & South Asia JOSÉ ANTONIO VARGAS LLERAS, Chair – Communications & Strategy Committee YOUNGHOON DAVID KIM, Past Chair See also[edit] Energy portal Global warming Greenhouse gas References[edit] ^ Wright, Rebecca; Shin, Hiroki; Trentmann, Frank (2013).

Offices were opened in Vancouver, Canada (Leadership), San Francisco (Information Technology), Washington (Publications), and Geneva (International Relations). In 2006, it opened an office at the UN in Geneva, which added to that in New York City.[5] In 2018, it established its headquarters in Deerfield, Illinois, United States.[6] Beliefs[edit] The Alliance has an evangelical confession of faith.[7] Leadership[edit] The WEA is headed by a Secretary-General whose function is to administer and represent the Alliance. German Thomas Schirrmacher, has been the Secretary-General since March 1, 2021.[8] List of former leaders[edit] This list contains the former leaders of the WEA since 1951.[9] Roy Cattell (United Kingdom) and J.

Theological concerns Function: To reflect on subjects of evangelical theology, and questions of importance concerning churches and society in the world, to monitor religious freedom. Statistics[edit] In 2020, WEA brought together 129 national alliances of churches that would have 600 million believers.[14] Some of these national alliances have traditional Protestant churches which are not traditional evangelical churches in the strict sense (Anabaptism).[15] In addition, the WEA unites only a certain percentage of evangelical churches.[16] Membership[edit] The World Evangelical Alliance embraces member-bodies whose identity and vocation are rooted in historic biblical Christianity.[17] WEA affirms and seeks the biblical unity of Christ's body, the Church, celebrating the diversity of practices and theological emphases consistent with the WEA Statement of Faith, recognizing the existing dynamic tension between unity and diversity. There are 3 types of membership, each with its distinct qualifications and responsibilities: [18] Regional & National Alliances are regional evangelical fellowships and their national fellowships/alliances. Affiliate Members are independently incorporated organizations with their own specific ministries and accountability, an international scope of ministry, and the capacity and authority to serve in and beyond the WEA community. Church Networks & Denominations are networks of churches (located in one or a number of countries), in agreement with the Statement of Faith and objectives of the World Evangelical Alliance. General Assemblies[edit] A General Assembly takes place every six years in a country that differs depending on the year.[19] It is a time of healing and gathering for national alliances and associations.[20] It allows the execution of administrative procedures and the training of leaders of each country. In 2014, a General Assembly was to be held in Seoul in South Korea, but was postponed.[21] 1951 Amsterdam (Woudschoten), Netherlands, August 4–11 1953 Clarens, Switzerland, July 27–31 1956 Rhode Island, United States, August 27–31 1962 Hong Kong, April 25-May 2 1968 Lausanne, Switzerland, May 4–10 1974 Château d'Oex, Switzerland, July 25–29 1980 London (Hoddesdon) England, UK, March 24–28 1986 Singapore, June 23–27 1992 Manila, Philippines, June 21–26 1997 Abbotsford, British Columbia, Canada, May 8–15 2001 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, May 4–10 2008 Pattaya, Thailand, October 25–30 2019 Bogor, Indonesia, November 7–14 [22] Publications[edit] There are two quarterly publications: a journal Evangelical Review of Theology (published on behalf by Paternoster Periodicals since 1977) and a newsletter Theological News (since 1969). Books are published occasionally.[23] Global engagements[edit] Development[edit] The fight against poverty is a major concern of the WEA.[24] Publications and meetings of the Alliance are the means used to influence and inspire development initiatives and actions humanitarian in churches, NGOs and political.[25] It is the origin of the Micah Challenge, an initiative to educate Christians and promote decision making among leaders.[26] Ecumenical Participation[edit] On June 5, 2010, Geoff Tunnicliffe, the International Director of the WEA, appeared alongside the leaders of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity and the World Council of Churches (WCC) in a press conference, entitled “Christian unity today”, at the Edinburgh 2010 Conference. The gathering marked the centennial of the 1910 World Missionary Conference.[27] In the same year, on 17 October 2010, Olav Fykse Tveit, the general secretary of the WCC, gave an invited address to the 3rd International Congress of the Lausanne Movement.[28] In the address he said, ""we are called to participate in the one mission of God"".[28] The World Evangelical Alliance, Geoff Tunnicliffe, the International Director and other WEA leaders were involved at each level in the development of the programme, and helped choose its participants.[29] In May 2014 the Lausanne International Student Ministry Global Leadership Network became a ""docked network"" with the WEA's Mission Commission.[30] On 22 January 2015, the WCC and WEA announced plans for closer cooperation, worship and witness.[31][32] In the same year, in June 2015, the WEA reported that discussions with the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity were finalised, and that ""the open questions of the 16th century are almost answered"".[33] The WEA representatives also reported that ""still open is the question to what extend [sic] evangelical Christians who stem from the reformation churches have full access to salvation according to the catholic view"".[33] On May 24, 2017, the WEA participated in a two-day Global Christian Forum meeting with the World Council of Churches, officials from the Vatican and Eastern Orthodox Churches, and the Pentecostal World Federation to facilitate moves 'towards greater oneness in Christ'.[34] The meeting was held at the WCC's Bossey Ecumenical Institute.[35] Some criticism was voiced of the WEA for lack of consultation about this move, the absence of regional and national discussion, or a vote of the General Assembly prior to the meeting.[36] Criticism[edit] Neglect of the suffering church in China[edit] The WEA was criticised for its positive assessment of the situation of the churches in China, after meeting with government approved representatives in 2009. China Aid and Church in Chains claimed, ""There are many Christians in China who are not free to worship, do not have Bibles of their own and are not free to organise their own affairs and this situation is not mentioned in your press release… our concern is that you have turned your back on these brothers and sisters.""[37][38] One exemplary case of abuse, that of the imprisoned Uyghur Christian, Alimujiang Yimiti, was raised in the criticism, but the WEA did not respond in detail.[37][38] See also[edit] List of the largest Protestant bodies Bible Born again Worship service (evangelicalism) God in Christianity Believers' Church References[edit] ^ William A.

Offices were opened in Vancouver, Canada (Leadership), San Francisco (Information Technology), Washington (Publications), and Geneva (International Relations). In 2006, it opened an office at the UN in Geneva, which added to that in New York City.[5] In 2018, it established its headquarters in Deerfield, Illinois, United States.[6] Beliefs[edit] The Alliance has an evangelical confession of faith.[7] Leadership[edit] The WEA is headed by a Secretary-General whose function is to administer and represent the Alliance. German Thomas Schirrmacher, has been the Secretary-General since March 1, 2021.[8] List of former leaders[edit] This list contains the former leaders of the WEA since 1951.[9] Roy Cattell (United Kingdom) and J.

Statistics[edit] In 2020, WEA brought together 129 national alliances of churches that would have 600 million believers.[14] Some of these national alliances have traditional Protestant churches which are not traditional evangelical churches in the strict sense (Anabaptism).[15] In addition, the WEA unites only a certain percentage of evangelical churches.[16] Membership[edit] The World Evangelical Alliance embraces member-bodies whose identity and vocation are rooted in historic biblical Christianity.[17] WEA affirms and seeks the biblical unity of Christ's body, the Church, celebrating the diversity of practices and theological emphases consistent with the WEA Statement of Faith, recognizing the existing dynamic tension between unity and diversity. There are 3 types of membership, each with its distinct qualifications and responsibilities: [18] Regional & National Alliances are regional evangelical fellowships and their national fellowships/alliances. Affiliate Members are independently incorporated organizations with their own specific ministries and accountability, an international scope of ministry, and the capacity and authority to serve in and beyond the WEA community. Church Networks & Denominations are networks of churches (located in one or a number of countries), in agreement with the Statement of Faith and objectives of the World Evangelical Alliance. General Assemblies[edit] A General Assembly takes place every six years in a country that differs depending on the year.[19] It is a time of healing and gathering for national alliances and associations.[20] It allows the execution of administrative procedures and the training of leaders of each country. In 2014, a General Assembly was to be held in Seoul in South Korea, but was postponed.[21] 1951 Amsterdam (Woudschoten), Netherlands, August 4–11 1953 Clarens, Switzerland, July 27–31 1956 Rhode Island, United States, August 27–31 1962 Hong Kong, April 25-May 2 1968 Lausanne, Switzerland, May 4–10 1974 Château d'Oex, Switzerland, July 25–29 1980 London (Hoddesdon) England, UK, March 24–28 1986 Singapore, June 23–27 1992 Manila, Philippines, June 21–26 1997 Abbotsford, British Columbia, Canada, May 8–15 2001 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, May 4–10 2008 Pattaya, Thailand, October 25–30 2019 Bogor, Indonesia, November 7–14 [22] Publications[edit] There are two quarterly publications: a journal Evangelical Review of Theology (published on behalf by Paternoster Periodicals since 1977) and a newsletter Theological News (since 1969). Books are published occasionally.[23] Global engagements[edit] Development[edit] The fight against poverty is a major concern of the WEA.[24] Publications and meetings of the Alliance are the means used to influence and inspire development initiatives and actions humanitarian in churches, NGOs and political.[25] It is the origin of the Micah Challenge, an initiative to educate Christians and promote decision making among leaders.[26] Ecumenical Participation[edit] On June 5, 2010, Geoff Tunnicliffe, the International Director of the WEA, appeared alongside the leaders of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity and the World Council of Churches (WCC) in a press conference, entitled “Christian unity today”, at the Edinburgh 2010 Conference. The gathering marked the centennial of the 1910 World Missionary Conference.[27] In the same year, on 17 October 2010, Olav Fykse Tveit, the general secretary of the WCC, gave an invited address to the 3rd International Congress of the Lausanne Movement.[28] In the address he said, ""we are called to participate in the one mission of God"".[28] The World Evangelical Alliance, Geoff Tunnicliffe, the International Director and other WEA leaders were involved at each level in the development of the programme, and helped choose its participants.[29] In May 2014 the Lausanne International Student Ministry Global Leadership Network became a ""docked network"" with the WEA's Mission Commission.[30] On 22 January 2015, the WCC and WEA announced plans for closer cooperation, worship and witness.[31][32] In the same year, in June 2015, the WEA reported that discussions with the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity were finalised, and that ""the open questions of the 16th century are almost answered"".[33] The WEA representatives also reported that ""still open is the question to what extend [sic] evangelical Christians who stem from the reformation churches have full access to salvation according to the catholic view"".[33] On May 24, 2017, the WEA participated in a two-day Global Christian Forum meeting with the World Council of Churches, officials from the Vatican and Eastern Orthodox Churches, and the Pentecostal World Federation to facilitate moves 'towards greater oneness in Christ'.[34] The meeting was held at the WCC's Bossey Ecumenical Institute.[35] Some criticism was voiced of the WEA for lack of consultation about this move, the absence of regional and national discussion, or a vote of the General Assembly prior to the meeting.[36] Criticism[edit] Neglect of the suffering church in China[edit] The WEA was criticised for its positive assessment of the situation of the churches in China, after meeting with government approved representatives in 2009. China Aid and Church in Chains claimed, ""There are many Christians in China who are not free to worship, do not have Bibles of their own and are not free to organise their own affairs and this situation is not mentioned in your press release… our concern is that you have turned your back on these brothers and sisters.""[37][38] One exemplary case of abuse, that of the imprisoned Uyghur Christian, Alimujiang Yimiti, was raised in the criticism, but the WEA did not respond in detail.[37][38] See also[edit] List of the largest Protestant bodies Bible Born again Worship service (evangelicalism) God in Christianity Believers' Church References[edit] ^ William A.

The gathering marked the centennial of the 1910 World Missionary Conference.[27] In the same year, on 17 October 2010, Olav Fykse Tveit, the general secretary of the WCC, gave an invited address to the 3rd International Congress of the Lausanne Movement.[28] In the address he said, ""we are called to participate in the one mission of God"".[28] The World Evangelical Alliance, Geoff Tunnicliffe, the International Director and other WEA leaders were involved at each level in the development of the programme, and helped choose its participants.[29] In May 2014 the Lausanne International Student Ministry Global Leadership Network became a ""docked network"" with the WEA's Mission Commission.[30] On 22 January 2015, the WCC and WEA announced plans for closer cooperation, worship and witness.[31][32] In the same year, in June 2015, the WEA reported that discussions with the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity were finalised, and that ""the open questions of the 16th century are almost answered"".[33] The WEA representatives also reported that ""still open is the question to what extend [sic] evangelical Christians who stem from the reformation churches have full access to salvation according to the catholic view"".[33] On May 24, 2017, the WEA participated in a two-day Global Christian Forum meeting with the World Council of Churches, officials from the Vatican and Eastern Orthodox Churches, and the Pentecostal World Federation to facilitate moves 'towards greater oneness in Christ'.[34] The meeting was held at the WCC's Bossey Ecumenical Institute.[35] Some criticism was voiced of the WEA for lack of consultation about this move, the absence of regional and national discussion, or a vote of the General Assembly prior to the meeting.[36] Criticism[edit] Neglect of the suffering church in China[edit] The WEA was criticised for its positive assessment of the situation of the churches in China, after meeting with government approved representatives in 2009. China Aid and Church in Chains claimed, ""There are many Christians in China who are not free to worship, do not have Bibles of their own and are not free to organise their own affairs and this situation is not mentioned in your press release… our concern is that you have turned your back on these brothers and sisters.""[37][38] One exemplary case of abuse, that of the imprisoned Uyghur Christian, Alimujiang Yimiti, was raised in the criticism, but the WEA did not respond in detail.[37][38] See also[edit] List of the largest Protestant bodies Bible Born again Worship service (evangelicalism) God in Christianity Believers' Church References[edit] ^ William A.

WFO mission is to represent the farmers’ voice and advocate on their behalf in all the relevant international processes affecting their present and their future, ranging from the global dialogue on agriculture to nutrition and sustainability. This includes Climate Change negotiations (COP), Committee on World Food Security (CFS), United Nations Disaster Risk Reduction (Sendai Framework), IFAD’s farmers’ forum, AMR debate (OIE, FAO, WHO), trade (WTO), and many more. The objective is to create the conditions for the adoption of policies and programs that can improve the economic environment and livelihood of producers and rural communities, strengthening the contribution of agriculture in tackling the challenges humankind faces. Following the latest developments in the international arena, in particular the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by the United Nations and the entry into force of the Paris Agreement, WFO equipped itself with the 2018-2028 Strategic Framework, which is providing the overarching framework for the works of the Organization over the next ten years. It was adopted by WFO General Assembly 2017, in Helsinki, Finland, and establishes the overall direction that the Organisation will take to foster the farming sector at global level. Within this framework, the WFO General Assembly 2019, in Luxembourg, adopted the Farmers’ Route Declaration, a statement that looks to promote a real “farmers driven approach” to tackle the global challenges humankind faces, highlighting the path that the farmers of the world are already building and following to achieve a more sustainable future for all humankind. The “Farmers’ Route Declaration” reaffirms the principle of the “Farmers Driven Climate Change Agenda”, adopted by the WFO General Assembly 2018, in Moscow, Russia, to enhance the position of the farmers in the global political dialogue on agriculture, starting from the climate negotiations.

WURC is the focal point for the WFEO members and committees activities with UN 17 Sustainable Development Goals.–K.N. Gunalan, Chair of WURC (USA)wurc-chair@wfeo.org The WFEO-UN Relations Committee (WURC) was created in September 2011 with the mission of acting as the WFEO interface with different UN agencies as well as intergovernmental organizations requiring engineering content, systems, methodologies and analyses. Until the creation of this Committee, the interface with the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development (UNCSD) and the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) was carried out by the WFEO Energy Committee. It involved the participation of WFEO at the UNCSD CSD-14 to CSD-19 meetings. WURC’s main objective is to put the Engineering contribution at the forefront of the Major Group’s international efforts towards fulfilling feasible programs and measures with a focus on sustainable development, climate change, environmental issues, and disaster risk reduction. The Committee concentrates its activities on actions developed within ECOSOC, UNCSD, UNEP, UNISDR, UNFCCC, UNDP, UNESCO, WMO, OECD, UNISDR and the World Bank. WURC activities include those related to the Rio+20 Conference and Post Rio+20. The Chair of this Committee acts as WFEO liaison with UNCSD and ECOSOC and leads the WFEO representation at the Scientific and Technological Communities Major Group that takes part in these UN bodies. WURC represents the global engineering community at the UN through the Scientific and Technological Community Major Group (S&TMG). This Major Group includes WFEO, and the International Science Council. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) site sets out the establishment and purpose of the Major Groups as follows: Since its inception, UNEP had a special relationship with civil society in tackling environmental issues. The Stockholm Conference on Human Environment, which led to the creation of UNEP in 1972, owed much to the enthusiasm, dedication and commitment of civil society. Many multilateral environmental agreements – Basel Convention, Montreal Protocol, Biodiversity and Climate Change Conventions, among others – were developed thanks to the lobbying efforts of civil society. One of the fundamental prerequisites for the achievement of sustainable development is broad public participation in decision-making. Especially in the context of environment and development, the need for new forms of participation has emerged. At the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), better known as the “Earth Summit” in 1992, Governments adopted Agenda 21, an action plan to achieve sustainable development. Agenda 21 defines the nine ‘Major Groups’ and in chapter 23 recognizes the important role of civil society and the need to strengthen the role of Major Groups. “Business and industry, Children and youth, Farmers, Indigenous Peoples and their communities, Local Authorities, Non-governmental organizations, The Scientific and Technological Community, Women, Workers and Trade Unions.” WURC participation consists of interacting with the UN as a member of the Scientific and technological Major Group (S&TMG) by responding to specific requests for input in writing and through personal representation at meeting such as the high-level political forum (HLPF) on sustainable development is the main United Nations platform on sustainable development. The first meeting of the HLPF was in September 2013. WFEO represented the S&TMG at that meeting and held the S&T seat at the meeting. WURC continues participating and was represented at the 30 June to 9 July 2014, 26 June to 8 July 2015, 11-20 July 2016 and 10-19 July 2017 meetings at the UN. WURC shared the seat at the HLPF with ICSU and ISSC. The Chair of WURC is a member of the steering committee for the UN High Level Political Forum (HLPF) which meets at least monthly. The HLPF meets annually and is reviewing annually the progress on the UN SDGs through 2030. A history of the activities of the Energy Committee interaction with the UN prior to WURC is presented in the following: History of Activities by Energy Committee Prior to WURC Activities.

The YE/FL was to be constituted by Young Engineers of the WFEO member countries and its council members are to be official delegates by national engineering associations of WFEO countries. CECB’s goal is the involvement of young engineers in the world’s leading activities to gain and share knowledge and experience, and to get the YE/FL abreast of global policies, which prepares them to take on future leadership roles. At the WFEO Energy Congress in Kuwait, 2009 (“Alternative Energy Application Option or necessity?”), the CECB encouraged the WFEO member countries to organise their young engineers for participation at the first YE/FL council meeting at the WEC 2010 held in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Aligning with the CECB YE/FL vision, the Executive Committees of the engineering organizations of respective national member countries nominated and sponsored young engineers to the first YE/FL task group and council meetings in Argentina, September 2010. Young Engineers / Future Leaders (YE/FL) is a now Policy Implementation Committee (PIC) of the WFEO, gathering young engineers from the different engineering associations of WFEO members. Vision To be acknowledged and celebrated as the global leader for the young voices of the engineering profession. YE/FL represents engineers at the beginning of their careers. The role is to support the vision of the WFEO with a focus on the meaningful inclusion and voices of this demographic of engineers around the world. A key component of this is the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), part of the larger 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. These goals integrate social, economic and environmental commitments—from reducing hunger and poverty, and improving health and work, to protecting the planet—in an inclusive and transformative way. This common framework seeks to ‘leave no one behind’ in an effort to ensure the well-being of people and planet, while promoting peace, prosperity, and partnership. Young engineers are important to this process, both as active stakeholders in achieving the SDGs, and as future leaders to carry them forward. This vision is aligned with and enables the realization of the WFEO Strategic Objective to ‘Be at the forefront of international efforts in making the Engineering profession contribute to scientifically and technologically achievable goals and innovation’. Mission and Outcomes To be a sustainable ecosystem that provides support, resources and a platform for young engineers in the WFEO community. In line with its members and other WFEO committees, the WFEO – YE/FL will execute a thematic, results-oriented program for 2020-2023 which includes the following objectives: Create an ecosystem that nurtures and enables support and youth innovation for young engineers in the WFEO. Establish regular conversation between the WFEO and the young engineers. Provide mentorship programs between young engineers and WFEO and partner communities. Increase understanding of international, national, and regional awareness on the impact of globalization on young engineers. Address the issue of sustainability for the wellbeing of the engineering profession. Support the WFEO’s President’s Task Force engaging with the United Nations High Level Political Forum (the primary body tasked with assessing progress on sustainable development, in particular the SDGs and other sustainable dev. frameworks) to provide the engineering perspective on the current issues. Provide a space for mutual learning, networking, knowledge sharing, and growth among young engineers, founded on the basis of equity and inclusion.

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.Find sources: ""World Future Council"" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR (September 2013) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The World Future Council (WFC) is an independent body formally founded in Hamburg, Germany, on 10 May 2007.[1] ""Formed to speak on behalf of policy solutions that serve the interests of future generations"",[2] it includes members active in governmental bodies, civil society, business, science and the arts. The WFC's primary focus has been climate security,[3] promoting laws such as the renewable energy feed-in tariff.[4] The World Future Council has special consultative status with the Economic and Social Council.[5] The World Future Council is part of the Steering Group of the Foundations Platform F20, an international network of foundations and philanthropic organizations.[6] Annual General Meeting 2011 Contents 1 History 2 The Hamburg Call to Action 3 Activities 3.1 Future Policy Award 3.2 FuturePolicy.org 3.3 Zanzibar International Children Rights Conference 3.4 Global Policy Action Plan 3.5 Implementation of Feed-in Tariff Laws 3.6 Campaign for Ombudspersons for Future Generations 4 Councillors 5 Honorary Councillors 6 Research and publications 7 See also 8 References 9 External links History[edit] The World Future Council was founded by the Swedish writer and activist Jakob von Uexkull.[7] The idea for a global council was first aired on German radio in 1998. In October 2004 the organisation began in London with funding from private donors in Germany, Switzerland, USA and the UK. Since 2006, the organisation headquarters is based in Hamburg, where the World Future Council is politically independent and operates and is registered as a charitable foundation. Further offices are located in London, Geneva and Windhoek.[8] The Council meets once a year at the Annual General Meeting.[9] The Hamburg Call to Action[edit] The Hamburg Call to Action was unanimously agreed upon by all Councillors present at the Founding Ceremony of the World Future Council, 9–13 May 2007.[1] It calls for the preservation of the environment and the health of communities, the promotion of ""systems and institutions based on equity and justice"", safeguarding traditional indigenous tribal rights, the protection of present and future generations from war crimes and crimes against humanity, a sustainable production, trade, financial and monetary system, the revival of local democracies and economies, and a universal ban on nuclear and depleted uranium weapons, cluster ammunition and landmines. It aims to generate governmental support for renewable energy technologies, the protection of forests and oceans, secure healthy food and water supplies, environmental security, healthcare, education and shelter, and a strengthened United Nations.[9] Activities[edit] Future Policy Award Future Policy Award[edit] The Future Policy Award (FPA) celebrates policies that create better living conditions for current and future generations. The aim of the award is to raise global awareness for these exemplary policies and speed up policy action towards just, sustainable and peaceful societies. The Future Policy Award is the first award that celebrates policies rather than people on an international level. Each year the World Future Council chooses one topic on which policy progress is particularly urgent. In 2009, the Future Policy Award highlighted exemplary policies foro food security. In the International Year on Biodiversity, the Future Policy Award 2010 celebrated the world's best biodiversity policies.[10] In the International Year of Forests, the Future Policy Award 2011 celebrated successful policies that protect, enhance and sustainably utilize forests for people, and thus contribute to a better world.[11][12] In 2012, the Future Policy Award celebrated the world's most inspiring, innovative and influential policies on the protection of oceans and coasts.[13] In 2013 the question was which existing disbarment policies contribute most effectively to the achievement of peace, sustainable development, and security?[14] In 2014the Future Policy Award was dedicated to policies that address one of the most pervasive human rights abuses that humanity is facing: violence against women and girls.[15] The Future Policy Award in 2015 committed to policies that contributed to protecting and strengthening the rights of boys and girls.[16] The 2017 Future Policy Award was dedicated to policies that effectively addressed land and soil degradation, and the related risks to food security and livelihoods, and help secure a sustainable and just future for people living in the world's drylands.[17] In 2018, the FPA – often referred to as the ""Oscar on best policies"" celebrated the world's best policies scaling up Agroecology;[18] the Indian state Sikkim was awarded Gold.[19] FuturePolicy.org[edit] The website futurepolicy.org website presents political solutions and assists decision-makers in developing and implementing future just policies. It is an online database designed for policy-makers to simplify the sharing of existing and proven policy solutions to tackle the world's most fundamental and urgent problems. It now contains policies, for example on renewable energies, energy efficiency, sustainable cities and food production in the era of climate change, that have been promoted in WFC publications, films and hearings.[20] Zanzibar International Children Rights Conference[edit] From 28–30 November 2017, the World Future Council hosted an international child rights conference in Zanzibar to explore the positive impacts of Zanzibar's Children's Act and share success stories on child protection, children friendly justice and participation from around the world. The Zanzibar Children's Act had received the Gold Future Policy Award in 2015.[21] Across three days, over 100 participants took part in a varied schedule of workshops, presentations and field visits looking at how to translate child rights laws onto paper into national and location programmes that improve the experiences of children and young people on the ground and effectively tackle child abuse, neglect, and exploitation. The conference was convened with the support of Janina Özen-Otto, the JUA Foundation, and the Michael Otto Foundation.[22] The conference closed with the Zanzibar Declaration on Securing Children's Rights, signed by over 50 representatives and policymakers from Ghana, Indonesia, Liberia, Nigeria, Seychelles, Somaliland, South Africa, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania, Tunisia, Zanzibar, as well as experts on children's rights and representatives from civil society, including Gertrude Mongella and Auma Obama.[23] Global Policy Action Plan[edit] The Global Policy Action Plan (GPACT) is a set of 22 interlinked, proven policy reforms that together, build sustainable, peaceful, and just societies and help to realise international commitments, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). The ""best"" policies identified by the World Future Council are those that meet the seven Principles for Future-Just Law-Making. A coherent best policy guide that brings together working innovative policy solutions and forward-thinking practical tools.[24] Implementation of Feed-in Tariff Laws[edit] Feed-In Tariff (FIT) laws to speed up renewable energy production have been introduced in several countries e.g. the UK, Australia, several US states, among them California, as well as in Ontario (Canada), with the support of the World Future Council. In establishing the Alliance for Renewable Energy, the World Future Council has created a coalition to spread renewable energies and contributed to the implementation of Feed-in Tariffs in the United States.[citation needed][25] Campaign for Ombudspersons for Future Generations[edit] The WFC has embarked on a Campaign for Ombudspersons for Future Generations on all governance levels. For the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, or 'Rio+20' in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in June 2012 the WFC was calling for the establishment of Ombudspersons for Future Generations, as a concrete solution under the second theme of the Summit 'Institutional Framework for Sustainable Development'.[26][citation needed] Councillors[edit] The World Future Council (WFC) consists of 50 eminent global change-makers from governments, parliaments, civil societies, academia, the arts, and the business world. Together they form a voice for the rights of future generations on all five continents.

FAQs The Commitment calls upon business, organisations, cities, states and regions to take urgent, ambitious and immediate climate action towards decarbonising the built environment. The next decade of climate action is crucial. Join our growing community of signatories acting to decarbonise our built environment. The Commitment The Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment (the Commitment) challenges business, organisations, cities, states and regions to reach net zero carbon in operation for all assets under their direct control by 2030, and to advocate for all buildings to be net zero carbon in operation by 2050. By setting ambitious ‘absolute’ targets, the Commitment aims to maximise the chances of limiting global warming to below 2 degrees, and ideally below 1.5 degrees, by drastically reducing operational carbon from buildings. The Commitment provides a framework to develop globally ambitious yet locally relevant, flexible and universally viable solutions for buildings within their portfolio, city, state or regional boundary. It sets actions to reduce energy demand and achieve net zero carbon through renewable energy and offsets (as a last resort). For businesses, the Commitment is one of three pathways available to join EP100. Find out more on the Resources & Further Guidance page. The five stages of the Commitment Click below to scroll through the stages 1Commit 2Disclose 3Action 4Verification 5Advocate Operational Carbon: assets under direct control to be net zero operational carbon by 2030 Measure, disclose and assess annual asset and portfolio energy demand and carbon emissions Develop and implement a decarbonisation roadmap outlining key actions and milestones Demonstrate enhanced energy performance, reduced carbon emissions and progress towards net zero carbon assets and portfolio Demonstrate leadership to support the wider transition towards net zero carbon buildings Commitment Signatories The Commitment officially launched at the Global Climate Action Summit on 13th September 2018. Since then, our community of signatories has doubled year on year, with assets and operations spanning across over 80 countries. Each signatory is unique. Whilst they have their own strategies, complexities and opportunities for their buildings they all share a common goal. Through this goal and as part of this community, all signatories show possible pathways for achieving net zero globally. We will look to promote and share their lessons, knowledge and leadership to further market transformation. Since inception, businesses and organisations signed up to the Commitment now cover nearly 6,000 assets, over 32 million m2 of total floor area and USD 100 billion in annual turnover. By 2030, this means that the operational portfolio emissions of these Commitment signatories will be at net zero, saving approximately 3.4 million tonnes of CO2 (tCO2e) that year. To put this in perspective, this is equivalent to the emissions from energy used to power 400,000 homes for one year [1]. Click below to find out more about each signatory and read their Commitment Profile outlining what actions and policies they are pursuing. 109 Businesses & Organisations 28 Cities 6 States & Regions Who can join? To become a signatory, entities must demonstrate an equivalent level of ambition and impact as the leadership required by the Commitment. This can be through: International presence to stimulate global markets Significant presence in their country Significant capacity to influence the built environment High level of carbon emissions within their sector relative to an average entity; and/or High potential for advocacy to increase uptake within industry In addition to whole organisations, divisions of entities and non-profit institutions are also eligible to sign up to the Commitment, subject to meeting the above eligibility requirements. Contact WorldGBC or your local GBC to find out more information. FAQs + - What is the Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment? WorldGBC’s Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment calls on businesses, organisations, cities, states and regions to reach net zero carbon operating emissions within their portfolios by 2030, and to advocate for all buildings to be net zero carbon in operation by 2050. The Commitment seeks to recognise and promote advanced climate leadership in decarbonising the built environment, to inspire others to take similar action, and to remove barriers to implementation. It aims to maximise the chances of limiting global warming to below 2oC and reduce operating emissions from buildings (currently 39% of energy-related CO2 emissions) through the five components of the Commitment framework: COMMIT, DISCLOSE, ACT, VERIFY, ADVOCATE. Through this framework, the Commitment ensures that all signatories can deliver against their targets, while driving real and tangible reductions. + - What does WorldGBC mean by net zero carbon? Net zero carbon is when the amount of carbon dioxide emissions released on an annual basis is zero or negative. Our definition for a net zero carbon building is a highly energy efficient building that is fully powered from on-site and/or off-site renewable energy sources and offsets. + - Why carbon? WorldGBC recognises that, in most situations, net zero energy buildings (i.e. buildings that generate 100% of their energy needs on-site) are not feasible. However, buildings which are energy efficient, and which supply energy needs from renewable sources, are a more appropriate target for the emissions reductions required to achieve the Paris Agreement. By using energy as the only source of measurement, the full impact of emissions on the environment cannot be determined. Carbon (measured in Carbon Equivalence CO2e) is the ultimate metric and a universal language to track the impact of greenhouse gas emissions of buildings. + - What kinds (scope) of emissions are included? The Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment focuses on operational carbon emissions (Scope 1 and 2 energy related emissions) of buildings over which the entity has direct control. More information about direct control can be found in the Detailed Guidance document. This determines a universally viable baseline in scope that can be applied to any type of entity, across all sectors and in any context. Including any additional emissions scope beyond this – e.g. embodied carbon, refrigerant emissions, industrial and manufacturing process loads or construction related activities – is strongly encouraged. An entity may determine, based on its carbon emissions profile, that one or more of the above list offer significant potential to reduce the carbon footprint for their business operations. This would be recognised within a signatory’s advocacy activities as representing a leadership position. WorldGBC intends to incorporate wider scope into the baseline of the Commitment as it becomes universally viable to do so, based on available methodologies and processes. + - Are industrial and manufacturing process loads included? Industrial and manufacturing process loads are often independent of the building itself. For example, processing of aluminium is an activity that happens within a building, but does not serve building occupants, or relate to how the building operates. As a result, industrial and manufacturing process loads are not currently included in the Commitment. Because all sectors must complete decarbonisation by 2050, WorldGBC strongly encourages all process loads from industrial manufacturing applications to be net zero carbon in operation by 2050. Currently, methodologies and technologies are limited in how to reduce these loads, and there is no clear pathway forward to meet the 2050 target. To facilitate the required market transformation, all entities are strongly encouraged to plan ways to reduce their carbon emissions and to develop roadmaps for improving energy efficiency and carbon intensity in these processes. We also encourage entities to engage in market initiatives such as the Better Plants initiative from the US Department of Energy. + - What about embodied carbon? While addressing operational energy-related carbon emissions through the Commitment, WorldGBC acknowledges that emissions from building and construction also comprise 11% of energy related emissions from the extraction and manufacturing of materials (known as embodied carbon) and construction processes. Due to the complex nature of standards related to embodied carbon (for existing assets in particular), WorldGBC does not currently require these to be included within the Commitment. Complexities include, but are not limited to: limitations in calculation methodology for global portfolios; influence of other certifications, programmes and supply chain mechanisms; and over-reliance on offsets as a solution. WorldGBC strongly encourages entities to plan, monitor and report embodied carbon emissions as they become proportionately more significant and are ultimately required to reach zero emissions by 2050. Although embodied carbon is not included in the Commitment at this stage, it remains a priority. WorldGBC aims to showcase the leadership of signatories which have included embodied carbon emissions as part of their advocacy activities, highlighting and recognising how the inclusion was achieved to support industry advancement in the future. WorldGBC aims to include embodied carbon emissions in future iterations of the Commitment, and actively encourages entities to plan how they can incorporate this challenge going forward. + - When do I need to disclose by? Entities must disclose within two years of signing, in order to create transparent building performance metrics at asset and portfolio level on which to appropriately inform the other stages. Disclosure of building performance metrics related to energy consumption and operational carbon emissions is intended to generate easily digestible and publicly available information (for consumers, employees etc.) at portfolio level, and to raise awareness of both energy consumption and the local carbon implications. + - Are there any minimum benchmarks or codes that need to be met for energy efficiency? Globally, energy efficiency measures could deliver a 48% reduction in global emissions by 2030, with 43% of those coming from buildings, resulting in cumulative savings of $2.5 - $2.8 trillion USD. [Source: How Energy Efficiency Cuts Costs for a 2 Degree Future] In this context, the Commitment values energy efficiency as a fundamental requirement of reaching net zero carbon for buildings and as a necessary first step towards decarbonisation. Nevertheless, the chosen framework or evaluation metric is entirely up to the entity and based on its own strategic analysis of its business. The energy efficiency measures that the entity implements are expected to contribute significantly towards the goal of achieving net zero carbon emissions while reducing operational costs, limiting reliance on renewable energy, and minimising excessive loads on grid infrastructure. In the absence of a specific benchmark for energy efficiency, common sources of reliable benchmarks for energy efficiency can be determined from third party green building certification schemes to ensure energy efficiency is addressed beyond local code levels. These are therefore a useful way to demonstrate action in this important area. + - Are offsets included? Offsets are permitted only as the final option in the renewable hierarchy to reach net zero carbon emissions. As per Principle 3 of the Advancing Net Zero framework, entities should produce and procure renewable electricity in a preferential hierarchy of on-site, off-site, or by offsets. These should also complement building measures that serve to decarbonise the grid. Entities should include the best possible renewable hierarchy for their portfolio to reduce associated offset costs and to maximise the decarbonisation of grid. Further information on the procurement of renewables and offsets can be found in Appendix B: Guidance for Procurement of Renewables and Offsets in the Detailed Guidance document. + - Do all buildings need to be certified? Aligning with recognised and industry leading local third-party certification schemes/market mechanisms often removes the need for additional assurance processes, and provides geographically and climatically relevant prescriptive pathways which, in some cases, are able to meet the energy efficiency requirements of the Advancing Net Zero framework. While encouraging entities to undergo this rigorous level of verification at both asset and portfolio levels, WorldGBC understands that this may not be possible due to financial, geographical, political or organisational constraints. Mechanisms for ensuring the appropriate requirements for asset verification, portfolio assurance and reporting in respect of assets and portfolios are described in the Disclose section of the Detailed Guidance document. + - What do you mean by advocacy? WorldGBC defines advocacy as the ability to influence and champion the need to decarbonise beyond scope within an entity’s direct control. All entities have the potential to influence supply chains and change perceptions about the achievability of the targets set out by the Paris Agreement. Advocacy sends the clearest and loudest message to wider industry to develop the key enablers to facilitate mass market transformation and to overcome specific technical challenges associated with transition towards a zero carbon emissions future. Advocacy activities will therefore be diverse and unique to each signatory, determined by evaluating the greatest area of impact and influence as relevant to the core business activities or the entity. + - Where can I find more information and guidance? Please contact your local GBC to find out more information and to determine the eligibility for the Commitment of your organisation. Your local GBC can arrange a workshop, meeting or phone call to discuss the Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment further, and to explore how the challenge of decarbonisation within our framework applies to your organisation. To understand more about what we mean by net zero, please read our white paper here.

Our Overview document provides a quick introduction to the Commitment. For more technical detail, please contact our Advancing Net Zero team here: anzproject@worldgbc.org. + - How does the Commitment align with other initiatives? Due to the Commitment's complementary nature in scope and recognition of other global leading initiatives, there is significant alignment and benefits in pursuing a combined approach. To provide further guidance on this, WorldGBC has developed 'Aligning Initiatives' documents for the following initiatives.

accelerating the uptake of sustainable buildings. As members of World Green Building Council, they convene businesses and governments to collectively drive environmental, economic and social impact within the built environment on a national, regional and global scale. Currently, there are 70 member Green Building Councils around the world, each at different stages of their own green building journey. There are three membership levels for Green Building Councils: Established – a fully developed and operational organisation that is running impactful green building programmes of work – delivering change on a national level, and embracing best practice governance, accountability, and transparency. Emerging – an organisation open to membership and which has a strong foundation, such as an elected board and staff to manage day-to-day operations. It is expected to progress to Established status within 24 months. Prospective – an organisation at the early stages of development but which has put in place a comprehensive strategy on how it will operate and advance green building in its country. It is expected to progress to Emerging status within 24 months.
