CMCC manages and promotes scientific and applied activities in the field of international climate change research. The Center has been  fully operative since 2006. The Adriatic Forecasting System (AFS) is a joint effort between CMCC and INGV. Based on POM model, AFS was implemented in Bologna at INGV since 2003. Lately, the forecasting system has been ported and validated by CMCC and is now running on the supercomputers at Lecce premises, with further improvements of the code. The operational chain provides 7 days forecasts for the Adriatic Sea and sub-areas, for the following variables: temperature, salinity, currents, sea surface height, stress wind, heat flux. Moreover, the system provides the vertical profile of the whole Adriatic Sea, displaying the variations in temperature and salinity for the area of interest. CMCC has contributed together with INGV, OC-UCY and CNR-IAMC to the development of the MEDSLIK-II model, a freely available community model designed to be used to predict the transport and weathering of an oil spill, using a Lagrangian representation of the oil slick. CMCC is also funding member of the consortium for the development of the Biogeochemical Flux Model (BFM) a numerical model for the simulation of the dynamics of major biogeochemical properties in marine ecosystems. CMCC is responsible for the research activities and the distribution of ocean model products in the SeaConditions service. SeaConditions is a public service providing oceanographic, sea state and weather at sea. Forecasts concerning the Mediterranean Sea are produced by numerical models using satellite observations and in situ data (e.g. opportunity ships and buoys). The computation is based on state-of-the-art ocean models, delivering detailed information with high spatial and temporal resolution. Forecasts for a time-span of 5 days, with a time resolution of 3 and 6 hours, are produced. SeaConditions is a product of the TESSA project, executed by CMCC, Istituto per l’Ambiente Marino e Costiero (IAMC-CNR) and Links s.p.a., which has realized the system for web publication of the forecasts. SeaConditions is in social media: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Sea-Conditions/290174447758031?fref=ts and twitter (@SeaConditions).

The organizational score represents the degree to which the organization influencing climate policy and legislation. Corporations also have relationship scores reflecting their links with influencers like trade associations. Both are combined to place the corporation in a performance band. Full details can be found here. close C- Performance Band 58% Organisation Score 56% Engagement Intensity Engagement Intensity The engagement intensity (EI) is a metric of the extent to which the company is engaging on climate change policy matters, whether positively or negatively. It is a number from 0 (no engagement at all) to 100 (full engagement on all queries/data points). Clearly energy companies are more affected by climate regulations and will have a higher EI than, for example retailers. So an organization’s score should be looked at in conjunction with this metric to gauge the amount of evidence we are using in each case as a basis for scoring. On our scale, an EI of more than 35 indicates a relatively large amount of climate policy engagement. close Modifications to InfluenceMap Scoring Relationship Score, December 2020 A new batch of industry associations has been uploaded onto the InfluenceMap system and the relationship scores recalculated accordingly. Updated terminology, February 2021 We adjusted the terminology used to describe the queries running down the left-hand side of our scoring matrix and added additional explanatory text to the info-boxes. This has no impact on the scores and methodology. It has been done following user feedback to improve clarity. close Sector: Chemicals Head​quarters: Brussels , Belgium Official Web Site: https://www.cefic.org/ Wikipedia: CEFIC Summary of InfluenceMap Scoring Climate Lobbying Overview: The European Chemical Industry Council (Cefic) appears to take a mixed approach to climate change policy and is strategically engaged with policymakers across a range of EU policy streams. The group’s engagement with several strands of climate change policy appears to have become more positive since 2015, but it continues to engage negatively on certain areas of legislation, such as increasing the ambition of the EU Emissions Trading System. Top-line Messaging on Climate Policy: Cefic has communicated strong support for long climate ambition alongside the need for caution with regard to safeguarding European industrial competitiveness in the near term. For example, in a 2020 position paper, the association stated support for the EU Green Deal and the EU’s ambition to become climate neutral by 2050. However, on its website in November 2020, the association appears to have published content which stressed the risks of unilateral climate action. Similarly, Cefic seemed to be supportive of government regulation to respond to climate change in response to EU Commission consultations in 2020, but has stressed on its website that policy framework conditions must also preserve competitiveness. Engagement with Climate-Related Regulations: Cefic seems to have mixed engagement with key EU climate policies. The association does not seem to have supported the increased ambition of the 2030 EU GHG emission Climate Target, advocating for an indicative 2040 target in a position paper on the EU Climate Law in 2020, contrasting with the EU Commission’s proposed 55% mandatory reduction target by 2030. In response to a consultation on the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) in November 2020, and in a joint letter from the Alliance of Energy Intensive Industries in 2021, Cefic did not seem to support the European Commission’s proposed reforms to progressively increase the carbon price and stringency of the scheme, including strengthening mechanisms such as the Linear Reduction Factor. Instead, Cefic has advocated for strengthened carbon leakage protection measures such as free allocation of emissions allowances and indirect cost compensation. In a meeting with EU Commissioner Breton in February 2021, Cefic stressed that a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism should be complementary to the ETS free allocation system, and in a meeting with Vice President Timmermans in November 2020, the Cefic President Martin Brüdermuller stated it would prefer that a CBAM did not apply to the chemical sector. Cefic has supported energy efficiency legislation for the building sector. In 2020, the Cefic Director General Marco Mensink supported the Renovation Wave, and in response to an EU consultation in 2021 Cefic supported “proven EU policies” such as the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive. However, in a position paper on the increased 2030 Climate Target in 2020 Cefic advocated that the Energy Efficiency Directive should pursue a performance-related approach and did not support “top-down targets like the absolute energy consumption cap under the EED.” Furthermore, in a position paper on the EU’s Climate Law in May 2020, Cefic suggested that “the Energy Efficiency Directive will have to be amended in order to take into account industry’s growing demand for energy.” In a 2020 position paper, Cefic supported increasing the ambition of the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR), although it is noted that this would likely reduce the burden of emissions reductions for sectors regulated by the EU ETS, such as chemicals. Despite this, Cefic supported policies such as CO2 standards for vehicles in response to the EU Comission's consultation on the Effort Sharing Regulation in 2021, and opposed a phase out of the ESR if the EU ETS is extended to the buildings and road transport sectors. Cefic President Martin Brüdermuller advocated for reform to the EU's renewable energy strategy to streamline and upscale renewable energy production in the Financial Times in June 2021, although previously supported the removal of levies on renewable electricity in November 2020 in Politico, stating that industry should not be ""slowed down by regulatory stumbling blocks."" Positioning on Energy Transition: Cefic’s Director General Marco Mensink communicated support for the transition of the energy mix and the decarbonization of industry in 2021, however, the association appears to retain a supportive position on the future role of fossil gas. In response to the Trans-European Networks for Energy (TEN-E) consultation in 2020, for example, Cefic supported the relevance of fossil gas infrastructure. On its corporate website in 2021, Cefic supported the EU’s Hydrogen Strategy and the Director General Marco Mensink stated support for renewable hydrogen in May 2021 at the Solar Power Summit.

The European Commission has recognised the chemical industry for its “indispensable” role to help society achieve the new European Green Deal objectives. Cefic has clearly expressed our industry’s support for the Green Deal and Europe’s ambition to go climate neutral by 2050. This transition will bring huge challenges, but it also brings a set of opportunities for industry. Europe must show its leadership in innovating and deploying competitive new technologies for delivering a climate neutral, circular and digital transition. Whether it is chemistry for solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, building insulation, medicines, chemical recycling technologies or the huge variety of other solutions we provide, our European chemical industry can excel and thrive in delivering its innovation-led contributions to the Green Deal.  This is also the way to ensure sustainable economic growth and new jobs thrive and remain in Europe. Supported by the major new, multi-billion European Recovery Plan package, Europe can move forward fast. If Europe’s many industries and companies are truly enabled to deliver to their strengths – such as coming up with world-class innovations – and are enabled to bring these to the market, we will jointly convert opportunity into success. But we will need to work with European policymakers and governments to have the right framework conditions in place that keep competitiveness during this transition in clear focus.

Key elements of a sustainable energy future include: (1) a substantial increase in energy efficiency, (2) a successful transition from conventional to renewable energy; (3) maintenance of the earth’s ecological systems and the life-supporting services they provide; and, (4) equitable distribution of energy services to different members of the population, both internationally and within nations. Mission To promote climate and energy policies that greatly reduce Europe’s greenhouse gas emissions and help Europe play an even stronger international leadership role in mitigating climate change. Geographic Focus Europe; European Union Programme Areas The European Climate Foundation has identified four priority programmes within its strategy: • Energy Efficiency • Low-Carbon Power Generation • Transportation • EU Climate Policies and Diplomacy • Global Climate Policy • Energy Efficiency The foundation aims to ensure that effective energy policies are adopted and implemented at the EU and national levels by leveraging a network of political contacts, grantees and other experts in Brussels and Member States. Technical and policy advice is targeted at the most winnable political opportunities such as a) creating the regulatory and market framework for large-scale energy efficiency investments, b) energy-efficiency in buildings and c) energy-efficiency in products. • Low-Carbon Power Generation The Power Programme focuses on policies that will fully de-carbonise Europe’s power supply by 2050 at the latest. These policies include prohibition of new unabated coal plant construction, support for commercialization of carbon-capture-and-storage technology, advancing large-scale end-use efficiency and accelerating deployment of renewable energy. • Transportation The ECF’s Transport Programme aims to reduce Europe’s vehicle emissions by increasing fuel efficiency and decreasing the carbon content of fuels. Initiatives of the programme focus on: 1. Car emissions standards 2. Different means for reducing the carbon footprint of road-freight traffic 3. Biofuels/Low-Carbon Fuel Standard • EU Climate Policies and Diplomacy The EU Climate Policies Programme aims to secure pan-European and in-country policy frameworks and political conditions that ensure European climate leadership. The Programme’s activities focus on ensuring that the EU commits to reducing CO¬¬¬¬¬2 emissions by at least 30% domestically by 2020, and that Member States deliver practical policies to that effect. In this framework the foundation uses targeted grants and contributes to the coordination of other organisations in order to maximise collective influence on European policy.

Contents 1 History 2 Mission 3 Publications 3.1 Mind the Gap 3.2 Lifecycle analysis 3.3 EV market report 3.4 Biofuels 3.5 Private Jets 4 Main campaign areas 5 Members 6 Funding 7 See also 8 References 9 External links History[edit] Since it was founded 30 years ago, T&E has shaped some of Europe’s most important environmental laws. It played a key role in getting the EU to set the world's most ambitious CO2 standards for cars and trucks and also helped uncover the dieselgate scandal; it campaigned successfully to end palm oil diesel; secured a global ban on dirty shipping fuels and the creation of the world's biggest carbon market for aviation - to name a few. In 2020 T&E’s campaigning led Uber to commit to electrifying much of its European operations. Mission[edit] Transport & Environment's (T&E) vision is a zero-emission mobility system that is affordable and has minimal impacts on our health, climate and environment. It is a non-profit organisation and politically independent that combines the power of robust, science-based evidence and a deep understanding of transport with memorable communications and impactful advocacy. Publications[edit] T&E is renowned for its thorough and targeted publications. Some of the highlights include: Mind the Gap[edit] Issued every year, this report examines the difference between the official laboratory test results and real-world CO2 emissions and fuel economy of cars. The difference between official laboratory test results and real-world car performance is jumping from 9% in 2001 to 28% in 2012 and 42% in 2015. It is expected to reach 50% before 2020.[1] One of the sources for real-world fuel consumption values used in this study is the data set provided by Spritmonitor. Lifecycle analysis[edit] This tool compiles all the most up-to-date data on CO2 emissions linked to the use of an electric, diesel or petrol car, to show how much CO2 electric cars can really save compared to diesel and petrol cars. EV market report[edit] T&E's yearly EV market report reportsheds light on the effect car CO2 targets have on the production of zero-emission vehicles. Biofuels[edit] T&E has published a number of reports exposing the true cost of the EU's disastrous biofuels policy which is responsible for widespread deforestation and habitat loss. Private Jets[edit] T&E's report exposed the outsized role played by the super rich hopping on private jets for short distances. Main campaign areas[edit] Air pollution[2] Aviation[3] Better trade and regulation[4] Biofuels[5] Cars and CO2[6] Cleaner, safer trucks[7] Dieselgate: Testing reform[8] Dirty oil[9] Effort sharing regulation[10] EU Transport Policy[11] Rail[12] Shipping[13] Vans[14] Vehicle noise[15] Members[edit] T&E is currently supported by 73 organisations (63 members and 10 supporters) in 24 countries.[16] Funding[edit] Transport & Environment receives funding from: European Climate Foundation,The Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation, Climate Imperative Foundation, the European Commission, ClimateWorks Foundation, Schwab Charitable Fund, Oak Foundation and a number of other high profile institutions and organisations.

Contents 1 History 2 Mission 3 Publications 3.1 Mind the Gap 3.2 Lifecycle analysis 3.3 EV market report 3.4 Biofuels 3.5 Private Jets 4 Main campaign areas 5 Members 6 Funding 7 See also 8 References 9 External links History[edit] Since it was founded 30 years ago, T&E has shaped some of Europe’s most important environmental laws. It played a key role in getting the EU to set the world's most ambitious CO2 standards for cars and trucks and also helped uncover the dieselgate scandal; it campaigned successfully to end palm oil diesel; secured a global ban on dirty shipping fuels and the creation of the world's biggest carbon market for aviation - to name a few. In 2020 T&E’s campaigning led Uber to commit to electrifying much of its European operations. Mission[edit] Transport & Environment's (T&E) vision is a zero-emission mobility system that is affordable and has minimal impacts on our health, climate and environment. It is a non-profit organisation and politically independent that combines the power of robust, science-based evidence and a deep understanding of transport with memorable communications and impactful advocacy. Publications[edit] T&E is renowned for its thorough and targeted publications. Some of the highlights include: Mind the Gap[edit] Issued every year, this report examines the difference between the official laboratory test results and real-world CO2 emissions and fuel economy of cars. The difference between official laboratory test results and real-world car performance is jumping from 9% in 2001 to 28% in 2012 and 42% in 2015. It is expected to reach 50% before 2020.[1] One of the sources for real-world fuel consumption values used in this study is the data set provided by Spritmonitor. Lifecycle analysis[edit] This tool compiles all the most up-to-date data on CO2 emissions linked to the use of an electric, diesel or petrol car, to show how much CO2 electric cars can really save compared to diesel and petrol cars. EV market report[edit] T&E's yearly EV market report reportsheds light on the effect car CO2 targets have on the production of zero-emission vehicles. Biofuels[edit] T&E has published a number of reports exposing the true cost of the EU's disastrous biofuels policy which is responsible for widespread deforestation and habitat loss. Private Jets[edit] T&E's report exposed the outsized role played by the super rich hopping on private jets for short distances. Main campaign areas[edit] Air pollution[2] Aviation[3] Better trade and regulation[4] Biofuels[5] Cars and CO2[6] Cleaner, safer trucks[7] Dieselgate: Testing reform[8] Dirty oil[9] Effort sharing regulation[10] EU Transport Policy[11] Rail[12] Shipping[13] Vans[14] Vehicle noise[15] Members[edit] T&E is currently supported by 73 organisations (63 members and 10 supporters) in 24 countries.[16] Funding[edit] Transport & Environment receives funding from: European Climate Foundation,The Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation, Climate Imperative Foundation, the European Commission, ClimateWorks Foundation, Schwab Charitable Fund, Oak Foundation and a number of other high profile institutions and organisations.

Contents 1 History 2 Mission 3 Publications 3.1 Mind the Gap 3.2 Lifecycle analysis 3.3 EV market report 3.4 Biofuels 3.5 Private Jets 4 Main campaign areas 5 Members 6 Funding 7 See also 8 References 9 External links History[edit] Since it was founded 30 years ago, T&E has shaped some of Europe’s most important environmental laws. It played a key role in getting the EU to set the world's most ambitious CO2 standards for cars and trucks and also helped uncover the dieselgate scandal; it campaigned successfully to end palm oil diesel; secured a global ban on dirty shipping fuels and the creation of the world's biggest carbon market for aviation - to name a few. In 2020 T&E’s campaigning led Uber to commit to electrifying much of its European operations. Mission[edit] Transport & Environment's (T&E) vision is a zero-emission mobility system that is affordable and has minimal impacts on our health, climate and environment. It is a non-profit organisation and politically independent that combines the power of robust, science-based evidence and a deep understanding of transport with memorable communications and impactful advocacy. Publications[edit] T&E is renowned for its thorough and targeted publications. Some of the highlights include: Mind the Gap[edit] Issued every year, this report examines the difference between the official laboratory test results and real-world CO2 emissions and fuel economy of cars. The difference between official laboratory test results and real-world car performance is jumping from 9% in 2001 to 28% in 2012 and 42% in 2015. It is expected to reach 50% before 2020.[1] One of the sources for real-world fuel consumption values used in this study is the data set provided by Spritmonitor. Lifecycle analysis[edit] This tool compiles all the most up-to-date data on CO2 emissions linked to the use of an electric, diesel or petrol car, to show how much CO2 electric cars can really save compared to diesel and petrol cars. EV market report[edit] T&E's yearly EV market report reportsheds light on the effect car CO2 targets have on the production of zero-emission vehicles. Biofuels[edit] T&E has published a number of reports exposing the true cost of the EU's disastrous biofuels policy which is responsible for widespread deforestation and habitat loss. Private Jets[edit] T&E's report exposed the outsized role played by the super rich hopping on private jets for short distances. Main campaign areas[edit] Air pollution[2] Aviation[3] Better trade and regulation[4] Biofuels[5] Cars and CO2[6] Cleaner, safer trucks[7] Dieselgate: Testing reform[8] Dirty oil[9] Effort sharing regulation[10] EU Transport Policy[11] Rail[12] Shipping[13] Vans[14] Vehicle noise[15] Members[edit] T&E is currently supported by 73 organisations (63 members and 10 supporters) in 24 countries.[16] Funding[edit] Transport & Environment receives funding from: European Climate Foundation,The Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation, Climate Imperative Foundation, the European Commission, ClimateWorks Foundation, Schwab Charitable Fund, Oak Foundation and a number of other high profile institutions and organisations.

These threats have been provoked by centuries of ongoing extractive and exploitative institutional systems and practices, a structural dependence on unconstrained economic growth, and the unfettered spread of unsustainable lifestyles.At the same time, ECOLISE sees hope in the rich seam of solutions that are being continuously developed by community-led initiatives across Europe and the world, including those that encompass inner growth, inclusive approaches to collaboration and to the governance of commons and stewardship of ecosystems. Furthermore ECOLISE is inspired and motivated by the growing interest in these life-affirming approaches.In this context ECOLISE’s purpose is to engage in, support and facilitate accelerated learning and collaboration among community-led initiatives, their networks and partners in order to catalyse systemic transformation within and across society.The work of ECOLISE is inspired by the vision of a compassionate, equitable and regenerative society of empowered and resilient communities that thrive on diversity and inclusion and live within planetary boundaries.Guiding Principles (to be expanded) co-creation social justice ecological integrity ECOLISE pursues three strategic goals: Cultivating a cohesive, integrated network of change-making networks, organisations, groups and people that co-create and inspire a holistic culture of regeneration. Expanding public and political awareness of the potential of empowered communities to positively transform societies and to help reach ambitious local to global level policy goals.

It is managed as a commons by representatives of ECOLISE member organisations. “The commons is not a resource. It is a resource plus a defined community and the protocols, values and norms devised by the community to manage its resources. Many resources urgently need to be managed as commons, such as the atmosphere, oceans, genetic knowledge and biodiversity.” – from The Commons, Short and Sweet by David Bollier ECOLISE has a simple policy and process that enables and supports the balancing of individual agency and collective intelligence within ECOLISE and its member organisations, so that initiatives from member organisations can benefit and thrive from participation in the ECOLISE commons. Any official representative of a member organisation, or a group of representatives of member organisations, can at any time propose a new activity within ECOLISE or that ECOLISE become a host organisation for a new activity. This is done by submitting a 2-page proposal to the ECOLISE council via the ECOLISE executive director, specifying what input or resources are being requested from ECOLISE. The initiator or initiators can invite representatives of other ECOLISE member organisations, selected individuals or representatives of organisations that are not members of ECOLISE to join the initiative. The ECOLISE council will discuss and aim to decide on such a proposal at its first next meeting. If there is a need to act urgently, the ECOLISE executive director can start acting on a proposal immediately, provided that the proposed activity is in line with general ECOLISE strategy and does not require excessive use of ECOLISE resources. If agreed by the ECOLISE council, the new initiative may start a new ECOLISE working group, a new ECOLISE project team or a new informal group of any type that is interdependent and hosted by ECOLISE and may be offered ECOLISE’s fiscal sponsorship until it spins-off as an independent legal entity or ceases to exist for whatever reason. Advice for making a proposal Please prepare your proposal based on the information shared here and on this website, in particular the ECOLISE strategy. For more on ECOLISE’s policy as a platform and as an incubator see HERE. Please be brief and include: who are the proposers; who will manage/coordinate the proposed project/activity; a short description of the project/activity; the overall goal and main objectives (and expected impacts); how it supports the implementation of the ECOLISE strategy; cost/budget estimate and source of funding (if already identified); what input is expected/desired from ECOLISE or specific ECOLISE members.

As part of our mission, we advocate for support for ecovillages at all levels, from the local and regional to international, in order to make this a reality. Ecovillage Obstacles Survey In order to inform our advocacy work for ecovillages at a local and national level, we run the Ecovillage Obstacles Survey in order to gather crucial information to support communities. Many good initiatives encounter administrative and bureaucratic obstacles when trying to create more sustainable lifestyles. We in GEN Europe want to help all new and developing initiatives with good advice based on the solid evidence of other more established ecovillages and their experience solving administrative hurdles that cause initiatives to fail. At the same time we want to gather all the bitter experiences when ecovillagers were not able to overcome dilemmas and find solutions. It is these cases that allow us to identify true blockages to Europe’s sustainable development. GEN Europe wishes to influence and demand change in rules and laws that prevent the creation of the sustainable Europe that Europeans have agreed to. ECOLISE We are founding members of ECOLISE – the European network for community-led initiatives on climate change and sustainability. Through ECOLISE we part in the annual European Day of Sustainable Communities, participate in policy and advocacy events at the European level, participate in the creation of reports and papers, and work jointly with other European organisations and networks to create an enabling environment for community-led initiatives to thrive. United Nations – COP We are regularly present at the annual United Nations climate summits, presenting community-led climate solutions and seeking partnerships to support local and national governments achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

The IAEA, in cooperation with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), has helped countries implement SIT, in which irradiation is used to sterilize insect pests and thereby suppress or eradicate their populations over time. TIS is a kind of “birth control” of pests and it is based on mass breeding of male flies. These males are then sterilized by gamma radiation and released massively into the wild, where they can no longer reproduce. The Genetic Sexing Strains (GSS) is a method that enables the separation of large numbers of insects according to sex earlier in the insects’ development cycle, so making the SIT application more efficient.

45,"European Nuclear Society - Wikipedia European Nuclear Society From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Since being founded in 1975, the European Nuclear Society (ENS) has grown to become the largest society in Europe for science, engineering and research in support of the nuclear industry.[1] ENS’s membership consists of national nuclear societies from 22 European countries, plus Israel. Within the membership there are also stakeholder representatives for nuclear technology and research businesses, with around 60 corporate members.[2] ENS exists to promote the advancement of peaceful uses of nuclear energy on an international level, encouraging networking between countries and facilitating meetings to support global communication on scientific and technical affairs. ENS also supports education and training in engineering, promotes international standardisation in the nuclear industry, coordinates the activities of the member organisations and develops the expertise and capability needed for the future of the industry.[3] One of ENS’s activities is organising conferences and workshops, providing a platform for international forums to exchange knowledge, experience, ideas and scientific developments.[4] The current president of the European Nuclear Society is Noël Camarcat.[5] The ENS is member of the International Nuclear Societies Council (INSC). Contents 1 ENS Young Generation Network (YGN) 2 European Nuclear Young Generation Forum (ENYGF) 3 Previous ENYGF events 4 See also 5 References ENS Young Generation Network (YGN)[edit] The ENS Young Generation Network (YGN) has been active across the society’s member countries since 1995 when ENS supported a proposal from Jan Runermark, the then President-elect of ENS, to spread the Young Generation Network (YGN) to all its member countries.[6] Five objectives ensure that YGN members are working towards a common goal, these are: Attracting more young people: Recruiting and educating young people to be skilled members of the nuclear industry Training new leaders: Exchanging knowledge between generations Thinking nationally: Participation of young people in the national nuclear societies Thinking internationally: Bringing together all national YGNs at European level Opening up nuclear conferences: Ensuring events are relevant and topical for young people to attend.[7][8] YGN membership is available to anybody working in the nuclear industry, as well as fields of nuclear academia and research. European Nuclear Young Generation Forum (ENYGF)[edit] The European Nuclear Young Generation Forum (ENYGF) is a biennial international event, held since 2005 by the Young Generation Network (YGN) as part of the European Nuclear Society.[9] The forum alternates with the International Youth Nuclear Congress (IYNC) and is held in a different location in Europe each time. The aim of the event is to provide a platform for learning and networking for young professionals in all areas of nuclear application. It provides a chance to enhance international communication as well as sharing technical advances and knowledge, learning from experience and discussing best practice as well as considering social and political aspects of the nuclear industry.[10] The forum involves: Formal lectures and presentations Workshops - which have previously included Women in Nuclear (WiN)[11] Technical tours Keynote speakers Social and cultural events Each forum has a number of central focuses, around which the speakers, lectures, presentations and workshops are based. In 2011, the forum in Prague focused on the topics of nuclear safety and severe accidents, education and training, new build projects and ITER and fusion.[12] At the 2015 forum in Paris the main focus points were nuclear efficiency and nuclear and the environment. Previous ENYGF events[edit] Following the success of IYNC conferences which began in the year 2000, the ENS-YGN decided to create the ENYGF 2005 and host the inaugural event in the city Zagreb, Croatia. Following this, the ENS-YGN elected cities to host the event every two years, the host locations to date have been: ENYGF 2007, Amsterdam, Netherlands[13] ENYGF 2009, Córdoba, Spain[14] ENYGF 2011, Prague, Czech Republic[15] ENYGF 2013, Stockholm, Sweden. With 300 participants where the previous record was 150[16] ENYGF 2015, Paris, France[17] The events are organized by an executive committee from the selected country. This executive committee can acquire assistance from delegates of other countries who chose to collaborate. All the committee members have a common goal which is to further the ENS-YGN mission and help to create a global community of nuclear professionals.

Initially active in Ukraine, in 2014 the fund formally extended its activities to Armenia, Georgia and Moldova, Belarus joined in 2017, and Azerbaijan in 2019. Objectives Through its investments, the E5P aims to address multiple Sustainable Development Goals, from sustainable cities to clean water and sanitation to climate action and others. The E5P projects are expected to result in CO2 savings equivalent to almost 1 million tonnes as well as multiple other benefits in terms of urban air pollution reduction, waste and waste water reduction. Actions in brief How can the Partnership help? The E5P fund merges financial contributions from the EU and a group of 21 nations (including the beneficiary countries) which are then used to attract national funds and loans from international financial institutions. Grants support energy efficiency projects, environmental initiatives to reduce CO2 emissions, and other harmful greenhouse gases, as well as to promote policy dialogue. To be eligible for grant support, projects must demonstrate their potential for energy saving, capacity to reduce pollution and/or the potential for regulatory reform. Typical projects include district heating modernisation and water and wastewater treatment as well as projects to improve energy efficiency in public buildings and street lighting. The fund also supports efficient solid waste management and strategies to improve local transport. Who stands to benefit? Active in Ukraine since 2010, the fund formally extended its activities to Armenia, Georgia and Moldova in 2014, to Belarus in 2017 and to Azerbaijan in 2019. Grant are flexible and recognise the specific priorities of each recipient country, helping national and regional governments reduce energy use, pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. Experience from Ukraine has already shown that E5P grants contribute to investment volumes that are on average five times the size of the committed grants. See project description.

50,"Refrigerants | EPEE The Voice of the Heating, Cooling and Refrigeration Industry Home News Events Contact Login About us Energy Efficiency Refrigerants Market Surveillance Documents Refrigerants EPEE supports the EU’s F-gas rules and has pledged to do all we can to make them a success. As part of our pledge, we work on raising awareness on the rules through communication tools (see below for more information). The EU must now work to ensure that the review of these rules is built on the existing requirements in a pragmatic, forward looking way. F-gases are mainly used in the heating and cooling sector, making them a necessary tool for the EU to fulfil its Green Deal contract with future generations. Heating and cooling represent half of the total final energy consumption in Europe and the sector must decarbonise rapidly through the growing use of electrical heat pumps. F-gases are needed to accommodate the full variety of heat pump applications as well as their safety and energy efficiency. EPEE has been a long-time supporter of the EU’s 2014 F-Gas Regulation. Delivering tangible emission savings year after year since its entry into force – the highest of all non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions – the EU’s 2014 F-Gas Regulation has been an effective gold standard for regulating F-gases, positioning the EU as a global leader. The 2021 revision of these rules must focus on fine-tuning the existing requirements in an intelligent, forward looking way without falling in the trap of dogmatic decisions. Relevant legislation & policies The EU adopted its current F-gas Regulation in 2014, which replaced the 2006 Framework. With the introduction of a cap- and phasedown of 79% by 2030 the legislation fundamentally changes the way industry can use HFCs. How? Find out more in our FAQ! EPEE supports the F-gas rules and have pledged to all we can to make them a success. The European Commission is currently reviewing the F-gas rules to ensure the framework’s alignment with the common 2030 and 2050 climate targets under the European Climate Law. A proposal for the revised regulation is expected by the end of 2021. EPEE actively monitors the situation to ensure that voice of the European refrigeration, air conditioning and heat pump sector is heard in the process.

Whilst the information is provided in utmost good faith and has been based on the best information currently available, it is to be relied upon at the user’s own risk. No representations or warranties are made with regards to its completeness or accuracy and no liability will be accepted for damages of any nature whatsoever resulting from the use of, or reliance on, the information. Documents published by Concawe are based on interpretations of Regulation (EC) 1907/2006 (REACH Regulation) and Regulation (EC) 1272/2008 (CLP Regulation) as well as guidance provided by and information obtained from the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA). REACH Roadmap for Petroleum Substances Background What is REACH? REACH is the European Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006, on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals. The REACH Regulation was adopted to improve the protection of human health and the environment from the risks that can be posed by chemicals, while enhancing the competitiveness of the European Union (EU) chemicals industry. It also promotes alternative methods for the hazard assessment of substances in order to reduce the number of tests on animals. REACH entered into force in 2007, and shifted the responsibility from public authorities to industry with regards to assessing and managing the risks posed by chemicals and providing appropriate safety information for their users. How is REACH evaluation progressing? Initial registrations for substances with higher volumes, manufactured or imported in the EU were made in time to meet three volume-based deadlines (2010, 2013 and 2018). As the Registration phase is now complete, the Evaluation phase of REACH will gather momentum. This phase is likely to carry on through the 2020s. The submitted registration dossiers may be subjected to compliance checks by European Chemicals Agency (ECHA). • Compliance checks are to ensure that the information required is sufficient for the regulators to properly evaluate the substance and its uses. Should the regulators identify that there are gaps in the information, registrants are given notice and a deadline to generate the missing information and update their dossiers. • ECHA also evaluates any testing proposals included in the registration dossiers to confirm the proposed studies will effectively generate sufficient data for the assessment of the substance, but also to check that the studies will not result in unnecessary testing, especially on animals. Once ECHA have completed compliance checks, local competent authorities (Member State) may select substances for substance evaluation. Motivation Petroleum substances are a prototypical example of UVCBs (Unknown or Variable composition, Complex reaction products and Biological materials), which present challenges for science-informed toxicity regulatory decision making. Although UVCBs are identified on global chemical inventories with unique Chemical Abstract Services (CAS) numbers and names, evaluating their toxicity remains challenging due to the chemical complexity and multi-constituent nature with largely unknown and variable composition. Therefore, regulators and industry have a common interest to define a process for (petroleum) UVCBs to ensure that there is no underestimation of hazards while minimizing or eliminating the use of animals in toxicology testing. All petroleum products were registered in the European Union for the 2010 submission deadline under REACH (≥1000 tons registration band), comprising more than 8000 individual registrations. A number of these submissions were accompanied by testing proposals to fill data gaps in specific toxicity endpoints. To minimize the need for testing in vertebrate animals, the majority of data gaps were addressed using read-across to similar substances for which the required data were available. Read-across of petroleum substances within the REACH framework is typically done by grouping the individual substances into product categories with similar manufacturing processes and phys/chem- properties (including refining history and boiling point/carbon number ranges/hydrocarbon class). However, category read-across approaches for (petroleum) UVCBs that are based solely on such broad similarity parameters are not always be considered sufficient. The Cat-App project initiated and funded by Concawe tackles this specific challenge by investigating practical strategies for grouping and read-across approaches for UVCBs with the aim of providing a cost-effective integrative approach to solving the similarity challenges of UVCBs using biological activity instead of a phys./chem. approach. The project integrates innovations in (i) in vitro testing, (ii) high-throughput genomics and (iii) integrative data analyses and visualisation into a workflow for biologically based read-across assessment of UVCBs in regulatory programmes.Share link Related Publications Cat-App: learnings from a multi-year research programme on alternatives to animal testing (Concawe Review 30.1) 25 Jun 2021- Read more Regulator-suggested ‘temperature correction’ of biodegradation rates leads to overestimation of persistence for hydrocarbon substances (Concawe Review 30.1) 25 Jun 2021- Read more Improving our understanding of the environmental persistence of chemicals 28 May 2021- Read more Can a chemical be both readily biodegradable AND very persistent (vP)?

The Deal’s comprehensive scope, its long-term perspective, and its emphasis on collaboration between public and private entities also stand to generate substantial opportunities for the EU generally, and for its industrial backbone specifically, if designed and implemented appropriately, and fit-for-purpose. Reflecting on the Green Deal as a potential enabler of low-carbon technologies and accelerator of industrial solutions for the decarbonisation of mobility and the industrial value chain, FuelsEurope welcomes in particular the European Commission’s emphasis on the following: The development of lead markets for climate neutral and circular products; The recognition of the need to maintain security of supply and competitiveness of the EU economy, including avoiding carbon leakage; The recognition that energy-intensive industries are indispensable to Europe’s economy (referencing the recommendations by the High Level Group of energy-intensive industries); The development of legislative options to boost the production and uptake of sustainable alternative fuels for the different transport modes; The intention to present a chemicals strategy for sustainability aiming at simplifying and strengthening the legal framework and providing greater transparency when prioritising action to deal with chemicals. Concurring with these conclusions, as emphasised in the Vision 2050, the European refining industry is already developing various low-carbon solutions, from low-carbon fuels to sustainably improving industrial processes, all the while providing affordable solutions to mobility, EU citizens, and the industrial value chain. However, the EU refining industry cannot walk this path alone. With the Deal’s legislative roadmap published, it is now paramount that the associated legislative framework be established in a way that ensures the Green Deal’s long-term success by firmly rooting it in comprehensive impact assessments, transparent law making, and technology neutrality that will allow the most cost-efficient climate solutions to succeed. The Green Deal itself states that “a new pact is needed […]” with “[…] industry working closely with the EU’s institutions […].” Drawing from our own expertise as an enabler of the low-carbon transition, FuelsEurope embraces the opportunity to provide input to the EU Commission for evaluations, impact assessments, and legislative proposals associated with the European Green Deal. In addition, evaluating the cumulative cost-impact of the Deal, ensuring coherence between this new proposal and existing legislation will be key. Amongst others, the ambitious plans of the Green Deal provide an opportunity to streamline the chemicals acquis by simplifying it, avoiding overlaps, and improving enforceability. The Sustainable Chemicals Strategy should foster the assessment of complex substances, cover strategies to avoid unnecessary animal testing, and continue ensuring high levels of protection of human health and the environment, while mitigating the administrative burden for companies. We firmly believe that it is only by rooting policy in sound science and carefully proofing the respective competitiveness effects that the EU can fully seize the opportunities of the Green Deal, and cement its global leadership in low-carbon technologies. FuelsEurope is eager to discuss with the EU Commission and co-legislators constructively how to deliver the low-carbon transition as envisioned in the EU Green Deal in a manner that is fit-for-purpose, and for the entire EU. © 2021 FuelsEurope - Disclaimer and Legal Notice - Cookies Policy - Privacy Policy - Terms of use - Privacy Centre - Competition Law Policy Guidelines - Design by Morris & Chapman",European Petroleum Refiners Association

The EU refining industry is committed to contribute to this objective by continuing to reduce its CO2 emissions and providing the economy and citizens with low-carbon fuels and other products that society needs. The development of a diversity of energies and energy carriers will give an economy flexibility, resilience, and the possibility for the market to select the optimal solution for every sector and use. Liquid fuels, with their unique characteristics, will continue to be employed in many transport fields. Therefore, the EU refining industry has an important and enduring role to play in the energy choices of the future, by providing low-carbon liquid fuels to complement low-carbon electrons, gas and hydrogen as energy carriers. Technology and collaboration across industries will facilitate the production of these low-carbon liquid fuels. The contribution of the EU refining industry can be enhanced by the EU industrial strategy and a policy framework which will enable its transition, while allowing refineries to retain economic viability in the face of a declining domestic market demand and of an increasingly aggressive international competition.

The European refining industry supports the same ambition. Our industry is transforming, and we have developed a comprehensive potential pathway of how we, together with our partners, can contribute to meeting the 2050 climate neutrality challenge. This work is the continuation of our Vision 2050, which outlined back in 2018 “A Pathway for the Evolution of the Refining Industry and Liquid Fuels”. By 2050, at the latest, every litre of liquid fuel for transport could be net climate neutral, enabling so the decarbonisation of aviation, maritime and road transport. Liquid fuels thanks to their unique energy density are simply the best form of energy storage. Low-carbon liquid fuels will play a critical role in the energy transition and in achieving carbon neutrality in all transport modes, as the global demand for competitive liquid fuels is expected to progressively increase. Alongside electrification and hydrogen technologies, low-carbon liquid fuels will remain essential even beyond 2050, bringing important benefits to the European economy and society. We stand ready to enhance our collaboration with policymakers, our value chains and other partners to create the right conditions and policy framework for investments in new technologies to address the climate challenge. The EU refining industry is already engaged in a low-carbon transition. We are uniquely positioned to keep driving the development of these technologies, but we will not be able to achieve this alone. With low-carbon liquid fuels, European refiners are ready to contribute to climate-neutral transport.

What is the European Round Table of Industrialists? There are around 1,000 business associations organized and addressed to the European Union (EU) level, which correspond to two-thirds of all EU groups (Greenwood, 2007, p.49). There is a wide range of these business groups, from unique and exclusive businesswide clubs of multinational firms (MNF) through to highly specialist interest organisations (Greenwood, 2007, p.49). The mobilisation of collective action from multinational firms is one of the most important developments in the EU and is a signal of new influential political actors at EU level (Cowles, 1998, p.108). This essay tries to outline what the European Roundtable of Industrialists (ERT) is exactly, how it was founded and whether they have substantial influence, and if so, why and how they organise it. One of the most important and influential businesswide clubs is the European Roundtable of Industrialists, which is representing around 45 multinational firms of European parentage (Cowles, 1998, p.108; Nollert, 2005, p.299). They describe themselves neither as a business lobby group, nor as a think tank (ERT, 2011). The members cover a wide range of industrial and technological sectors and are situated all over Europe (ERT, 2011). Important member firms are for example Unilever, Nestlé, Siemens, ThyssenKrupp, Philipps, Bayer and BMW (ERT, 2011; Spindler, 2002, p.17). Together they have sales figures of more than 1,000 billion Euros, provide around 6.6 million jobs (ERT, 2011) and are responsible for huge investments, not only in Europe (Richardson, 2000, p.10). The secretariat is now based in Brussels and is regularly publishing articles on different pan-European subjects (Nollert, 2005, p.299). The main concern of the ERT is the creation of conditions necessary to improve European growth and jobs (ERT, 2011). The membership is only possible by invitation and is rather personal than corporate. Only industrial leaders, for example Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) or Presidents from large and important European firms, are invited (Greenwood, 2007, p.59). The concept of “industrialist” was very important, because it defines the common interest of the ERT. The focus of every firm has to be on an industrial scale (Richardson, 2000, p.10). The election of new members is one of the most important issues within the ERT. Not only tries the ERT to balance the representation from every business sector and country, the firms also have to be substantial, which means a turnover of many billions, a solid reputation and international oriented interests (Richardson, 2000, p.10). Additionally, the ERT looks at the standing and reputation of every single businessman. Without a personal recommendation, it is impossible to become a member (Richardson, 2000, p.10). The ERT Members meet at plenary sessions twice a year to determine the work programme, set priorities and establish specialised working groups (ERT, 2011). According to Richardson (2000, p.10) usually about two-third of all members show up, despite the fact that no substitutes were allowed. The working groups, which undertake most of the work, are chaired by ERT members and associates of the involved firms (ERT, 2011). They prepare and present proposals to the plenary and play a leading role in drafting official ERT messages. Decisions are taken by consensus (ERT, 2011). The ERT is more strategy und vision-oriented than interested in everyday politics. Therefore, they are more interested in putting big issues on the EU policy agenda (Greenwood, 2007, p.59). In general, the ERT promotes competition, free market integration and neoliberal deregulation (Spindler, 2002, p.20). The ERT provides initiatives for collective goods, such as the single European market or trans-European infrastructure networks, from road and rail projects through to telecommunication networks. This prompts the question why business leaders have an appeal to organize themselves at a European level and expend effort in a good from which everyone will benefit. Mancur Olson describes this problem as free ridership. Cowles (1998, p.120) argues that the ERT members receive selective incentives such as the contact with other CEOs and being part of an organisation with high-level contacts right up to high EU politicians. Additionally they gain access to potential contracts for the expansion of the trans-European networks (Cowles, 1998, p.120). 2. ERT history Two leading European Commissioners, Etienne Davignon and François-Xavier Ortoli, repeatedly asked to whom they should talk to, when they want to talk about European industry. The reason was, that the European industry was facing a crisis while the politicians didn´t understand why and had no suggestions to solve the problem (Richardson, 2000, p.6). In 1983 a group of industrialists, led by Pehr Gyllenhammar of Volvo, responded to this request by setting up an informal panel, called ERT (Richardson, 2000, p.6; Ziltener, 2004, p.956).

66,"European Round Table of Industrialists - Wikipedia European Round Table of Industrialists From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search The European Round Table of Industrialists, abbreviated ERT, is an advocacy group in the European Union consisting of some 50 European industrial leaders working to strengthen competitiveness in Europe. The group works at both national and European levels. Contents 1 History 2 Chairmen 3 List of current members 2021 4 Critique of ERT 5 References 6 External links History[edit] The roots of the European Round Table of Industrialists date back to the early 1980s. The European economy at that time, was regarded as suffering from eurosclerosis, which was perceived as a lack of dynamism, innovation and competitiveness when compared with the economies of Japan and the United States. The negative economic consequences of the competitive situation worried several leading European businesspeople. At the initiative of Pehr G. Gyllenhammar, the CEO of Volvo, 17 European businessmen met in the Paris boardroom of Volvo on 6 and 7 April 1983. They envisioned to create an organisation, which would be able to convey its message about the state of the economy to the European political leaders. The core message was that Europe needed to modernise its industrial bases in order to regain its competitiveness. The industry perceived a lack of a common European industrial development policy, in contrast to the European agricultural policy. The meeting in Paris was attended by Pehr G. Gyllenhammar (Volvo), Karl Beurle (Thyssen), Carlo De Benedetti (Olivetti), Curt Nicolin (ASEA), Harry Gray (United Technologies), John Harvey - Jones (ICI), Wolfgang Seelig (Siemens), Umberto Agnelli (Fiat), Peter Baxendell (Shell), Olivier Lecerf (Lafarge Coppée), José Bidegain (Cie de St Gobain), Wisse Dekker (Philips), Antoine Riboud (BSN), Bernard Hanon (Renault), Louis von Planta (Ciba-Geigy) and Helmut Maucher (Nestlé). Both François-Xavier Ortoli and Étienne Davignon from the European Commission attended the meeting. At the second meeting, on 1 June 1983 in Amsterdam, the ERT organisation was established, its charter accepted and the necessary financial arrangements were made. The goal of the ERT would be to promote competition and competitiveness on a European scale. At the outset, the group played an important role in the planning of the Oresund Bridge between Denmark and Sweden as part of its European Link project on improvements to the European infrastructure. This project also included several other international European infrastructural projects e.g. the Fehmarn Belt Bridge between Denmark and Germany. Later on the ERT became active in the promotion of the earliest Trans-European Networks. The ERT's busiest decade was 1988 to 1998 under different chairmen: Wisse Dekker (Netherlands), Jérôme Monod (France) and Helmut Maucher (Switzerland) with Keith Richardson as Secretary General. During this time the ERT published influential reports in the domains of Internal Market, Infrastructure, Education, Environment, Information Society, Competitiveness, Job Creation and tax issues. The ERT fostered direct government-industry consultation at many different levels. Its active role in encouraging the first global G8 cooperation on building common standards for the Information Society was recognised by several country leaders, including President Bill Clinton. From early on, ERT policy supported EU enlargement. It promoted and often led business dialogues between the EU and business circles in the US and in Japan as well as in developing countries. The ERT gave an early lead in presenting positive contributions to the climate change debate, and control carbon emissions. Two more recent areas for ERT contribution are pensions and international standards. Chairmen[edit] 1983 - 1988: Pehr G.

ERT figures largely in the film as an organisation that has had the closest links with the reins of power in the EU, to the extent that certain EU reports, for instance those on European traffic networks, borrowed heavily from ERT reports.[2] In a report by the former secretary general of the ERT, Keith Richardson, entitled Big Business and the European Agenda, an ASEED Europe report called Misshaping Europe is quoted. The report was critical of the ERT's perceived success in influencing the European Commission: ""Presenting a report under the name of the ERT seems to be the only way of getting the attention of the leaders of the EC (the European Community, as it then was). Time after time the ERT has succeeded in getting the EC to adopt the agenda of business at the expense of the environment, of labour and social concerns and of genuine democratic participation....."" ""The political agenda of the EC has to a large extent been dominated by the ERT......While the approximately 5000 lobbyists working in Brussels might occasionally succeed in changing details in directives, the ERT has in many cases been setting the agenda for and deciding the content of EC proposals.""[3] References[edit] ^ Members of the ERT ^ ""The Brussels Business - Who Runs the European Union"".

Energy Transition & Climate Change The EU has taken a global lead in climate action - climate neutrality and global competitiveness must be mutually reinforcing. Trade & Market Access Free trade is one of the founding principles of the EU, and we need to take a stand to protect and preserve it. Competition Policy Unfair trading practices as well as the increasing dominance of global companies originating in the East and West are threatening Europe’s economy. Finance & Tax Europe must become a more attractive destination for doing business and making investments. #EmbraceDifference About 50 global CEOs and Chairmen of leading European companies in the industrial and technological sectors #EmbraceDifference.

70,"European Round Table of Industrialists - Wikipedia European Round Table of Industrialists From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search The European Round Table of Industrialists, abbreviated ERT, is an advocacy group in the European Union consisting of some 50 European industrial leaders working to strengthen competitiveness in Europe. The group works at both national and European levels. Contents 1 History 2 Chairmen 3 List of current members 2021 4 Critique of ERT 5 References 6 External links History[edit] The roots of the European Round Table of Industrialists date back to the early 1980s. The European economy at that time, was regarded as suffering from eurosclerosis, which was perceived as a lack of dynamism, innovation and competitiveness when compared with the economies of Japan and the United States. The negative economic consequences of the competitive situation worried several leading European businesspeople. At the initiative of Pehr G. Gyllenhammar, the CEO of Volvo, 17 European businessmen met in the Paris boardroom of Volvo on 6 and 7 April 1983. They envisioned to create an organisation, which would be able to convey its message about the state of the economy to the European political leaders. The core message was that Europe needed to modernise its industrial bases in order to regain its competitiveness. The industry perceived a lack of a common European industrial development policy, in contrast to the European agricultural policy. The meeting in Paris was attended by Pehr G. Gyllenhammar (Volvo), Karl Beurle (Thyssen), Carlo De Benedetti (Olivetti), Curt Nicolin (ASEA), Harry Gray (United Technologies), John Harvey - Jones (ICI), Wolfgang Seelig (Siemens), Umberto Agnelli (Fiat), Peter Baxendell (Shell), Olivier Lecerf (Lafarge Coppée), José Bidegain (Cie de St Gobain), Wisse Dekker (Philips), Antoine Riboud (BSN), Bernard Hanon (Renault), Louis von Planta (Ciba-Geigy) and Helmut Maucher (Nestlé). Both François-Xavier Ortoli and Étienne Davignon from the European Commission attended the meeting. At the second meeting, on 1 June 1983 in Amsterdam, the ERT organisation was established, its charter accepted and the necessary financial arrangements were made. The goal of the ERT would be to promote competition and competitiveness on a European scale. At the outset, the group played an important role in the planning of the Oresund Bridge between Denmark and Sweden as part of its European Link project on improvements to the European infrastructure. This project also included several other international European infrastructural projects e.g. the Fehmarn Belt Bridge between Denmark and Germany. Later on the ERT became active in the promotion of the earliest Trans-European Networks. The ERT's busiest decade was 1988 to 1998 under different chairmen: Wisse Dekker (Netherlands), Jérôme Monod (France) and Helmut Maucher (Switzerland) with Keith Richardson as Secretary General. During this time the ERT published influential reports in the domains of Internal Market, Infrastructure, Education, Environment, Information Society, Competitiveness, Job Creation and tax issues. The ERT fostered direct government-industry consultation at many different levels. Its active role in encouraging the first global G8 cooperation on building common standards for the Information Society was recognised by several country leaders, including President Bill Clinton. From early on, ERT policy supported EU enlargement. It promoted and often led business dialogues between the EU and business circles in the US and in Japan as well as in developing countries. The ERT gave an early lead in presenting positive contributions to the climate change debate, and control carbon emissions. Two more recent areas for ERT contribution are pensions and international standards. Chairmen[edit] 1983 - 1988: Pehr G.

ERT figures largely in the film as an organisation that has had the closest links with the reins of power in the EU, to the extent that certain EU reports, for instance those on European traffic networks, borrowed heavily from ERT reports.[2] In a report by the former secretary general of the ERT, Keith Richardson, entitled Big Business and the European Agenda, an ASEED Europe report called Misshaping Europe is quoted. The report was critical of the ERT's perceived success in influencing the European Commission: ""Presenting a report under the name of the ERT seems to be the only way of getting the attention of the leaders of the EC (the European Community, as it then was). Time after time the ERT has succeeded in getting the EC to adopt the agenda of business at the expense of the environment, of labour and social concerns and of genuine democratic participation....."" ""The political agenda of the EC has to a large extent been dominated by the ERT......While the approximately 5000 lobbyists working in Brussels might occasionally succeed in changing details in directives, the ERT has in many cases been setting the agenda for and deciding the content of EC proposals.""[3] References[edit] ^ Members of the ERT ^ ""The Brussels Business - Who Runs the European Union"".

What is European Youth Forum? Independently established by youth organisations, the European Youth Forum is made up of more than 90 National Youth Councils and International Non-Governmental Youth Organisations, which are federations of youth organisations in themselves. It brings together tens of millions of young people from all over Europe, organised in order to represent their common interests. Representation, internal democracy, independence, openness and inclusion are among the main principles for the functioning of the European Youth Forum and its Member Organisations. Aims Increase the participation of young people and youth organisations in society, as well as in decision-making processes; Positively influence policy issues affecting young people and youth organisations, by being a recognised partner for international institutions, namely the European Union, the Council of Europe and the United Nations; Promote the concept of youth policy as an integrated and cross-sectoral element of overall policy development; Facilitate the participation of young people through the development of sustainable and independent youth organisations at the national and international level; Foster the exchange of ideas and experience, mutual understanding, and equal rights and opportunities among young people in Europe; Uphold intercultural understanding, democracy, respect, active citizenship and solidarity; As the biggest regional youth platform in the world, we work to deepen European integration while at the same time contributing to the development of youth work in other regions of the world. Co-operation What is unique about the Council of Europe's youth work is that its programmes and policy orientations are co-managed, which means that young people from youth organisations are equal partners in decision-making. The members of the European Youth Forum nominate a majority of the members of the so-called Advisory Council,  which together with representatives of member state governments forms the Joint Council. The Joint Council defines the priorities for the youth activities and policy of the Council of Europe. The European Youth Forum also maintains contacts with the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and with the Education Directorate. Council of Europe Youth Work Portfolio The Council of Europe Youth Work Portfolio  is an initiative of the Council of Europe in co-operation with partners such as the European Commission and the European Youth Forum. It has been developed at the European level, but it is not primarily for people and organisations working at the European level or internationally. The Portfolio is addressed to youth workers and leaders working at any level from local to international.

The European Youth Forum works in the fields of youth policy and youth work development. It focuses its work on European youth policy matters, whilst through engagement on the global level, it is enhancing the capacities of its members and promoting global interdependence. In its daily work, the European Youth Forum represents the views and opinions of youth organizations in all relevant policy areas and promotes the cross-sectoral nature of youth policy towards a variety of institutional actors. The principles of equality and sustainable development are mainstreamed in the work of the European Youth Forum.[2][3][4] It consists of 44 National Youth Councils and 61 international youth NGOs, a total of 105.[5] Contents 1 History 2 Vision, mission, and aims 2.1 Vision 2.2 Mission 2.3 Aims 3 Organisation 3.1 Presidents 3.2 Current Board 3.3 Secretaries-General 3.4 Funding 4 Membership 4.1 National Youth Councils 4.2 International Non-Governmental Youth Organisations 5 References 6 External links History[edit] The European Youth Forum is a European international organization, which was established in 1996 by national youth councils and international non-governmental youth organizations. It works as the successor to the Council of European National Youth Committees (CENYC), Youth Forum of the European Communities (YFEU), and the European Co-ordination Bureau of International Youth Organisations (ECB). CENYC and ECB had been representing youth interests since the sixties.[6] The YFEU was set up by them in the late 1970s to work vis a vis the European Union (then called the European Community).[7] The establishment of a single structure replacing all three was a major rationalization. Vision, mission, and aims[edit] According to the European Youth Forum[8] their Vision, mission, and aims are as follows: Vision[edit] To be the voice of young people in Europe, where young people are equal citizens and are encouraged and supported to achieve their fullest potential as global citizens. Mission[edit] The European Youth Forum is an independent, democratic, youth-led platform, representing national youth councils and international youth organizations from across Europe. The Youth Forum works to empower young people to participate actively in society to improve their own lives, by representing and advocating their needs and interests and those of their organizations. Aims[edit] Increase the participation of young people and youth organizations in society, as well as in decision-making processes; Positively influence policy issues affecting young people and youth organizations, by being a recognized partner for international institutions, namely the European Union, the Council of Europe and the United Nations; Promote the concept of youth policy as an integrated and cross-sectoral element of overall policy development, namely through youth mainstreaming; Facilitate the participation of young people through the development of sustainable and independent youth organizations at the national and international level, particularly in respect to ensuring dependable, adequate funding for them; Promote the exchange of ideas and experience, mutual understanding, as well as the equal rights and opportunities among young people in Europe; Uphold intercultural understanding, democracy, respect, diversity, human rights, active citizenship, and solidarity; Contribute to the development of youth work in other regions of the world. The European Youth Forum has the task of nominating 20 young people from its member organizations for the Advisory Council on Youth, 13 representatives from international youth organizations (INGYOs) and seven representatives from national youth councils for a two-year mandate.[9] These are elected democratically by the member organizations, usually at the Council of Members (COMEM) in Brussels in spring.[10] Organisation[edit] Presidents[edit] Date President Nationality Nominating organization(s) 2021-2022 Ms Silja Markkula Finland World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM), Suomen Nuorisoyhteistyö Allianssiry (Allianssi) 2019-2020 Ms Carina Autengruber Austria Oesterreichische Kinder- und Jugendvertretung (ÖJV), International Federation of Catholic Parochial Youth Movements (FIMCAP) 2017-2018 Mr Luis Alvarado Martinez Spain Association des Etats Généraux des Etudiants de l’Europe (AEGEE-Europe) 2015-2016 Ms Johanna Nyman Finland Finnish Youth Cooperation (Allianssi) 2011-2014 Mr Peter Matjašič Slovenia 2009-2010 Mr Tine Radinja Slovenia 2007-2008 Ms Bettina Schwarzmayr Austria 2005-2006 Mr Renaldas Vaisbrodas Lithuania 2003-2004 Mr Giacomo Filibeck Italy 2001-2002 Mr Henrik Söderman Finland 1999-2000 Mr Pau Solanilla Spain 1997-1998 Ms Pauliina Arola Finland Current Board[edit] Each board elected by the entire membership every 2 years at the General Assembly, it is made up of: President nominated from a National Youth Council (NYC) and/or an International Non-Governmental Youth Organization (INGYO).

VTCs also represents the further recognition of volunteer work as an important contribution to society and to the work of youth organizations. These contributions in 2012 represent approximately 4.8% of the Youth Forum budget.[11] Membership[edit] The European Youth Forum has 104 member organizations of two types of Membership: National Youth Council and International Non-Governmental Youth Organization, of which there are three levels: Observer, Candidate and Full member.

The European Youth Forum works in the fields of youth policy and youth work development. It focuses its work on European youth policy matters, whilst through engagement on the global level, it is enhancing the capacities of its members and promoting global interdependence. In its daily work, the European Youth Forum represents the views and opinions of youth organizations in all relevant policy areas and promotes the cross-sectoral nature of youth policy towards a variety of institutional actors. The principles of equality and sustainable development are mainstreamed in the work of the European Youth Forum.[2][3][4] It consists of 44 National Youth Councils and 61 international youth NGOs, a total of 105.[5] Contents 1 History 2 Vision, mission, and aims 2.1 Vision 2.2 Mission 2.3 Aims 3 Organisation 3.1 Presidents 3.2 Current Board 3.3 Secretaries-General 3.4 Funding 4 Membership 4.1 National Youth Councils 4.2 International Non-Governmental Youth Organisations 5 References 6 External links History[edit] The European Youth Forum is a European international organization, which was established in 1996 by national youth councils and international non-governmental youth organizations. It works as the successor to the Council of European National Youth Committees (CENYC), Youth Forum of the European Communities (YFEU), and the European Co-ordination Bureau of International Youth Organisations (ECB). CENYC and ECB had been representing youth interests since the sixties.[6] The YFEU was set up by them in the late 1970s to work vis a vis the European Union (then called the European Community).[7] The establishment of a single structure replacing all three was a major rationalization. Vision, mission, and aims[edit] According to the European Youth Forum[8] their Vision, mission, and aims are as follows: Vision[edit] To be the voice of young people in Europe, where young people are equal citizens and are encouraged and supported to achieve their fullest potential as global citizens. Mission[edit] The European Youth Forum is an independent, democratic, youth-led platform, representing national youth councils and international youth organizations from across Europe. The Youth Forum works to empower young people to participate actively in society to improve their own lives, by representing and advocating their needs and interests and those of their organizations.

VTCs also represents the further recognition of volunteer work as an important contribution to society and to the work of youth organizations. These contributions in 2012 represent approximately 4.8% of the Youth Forum budget.[11] Membership[edit] The European Youth Forum has 104 member organizations of two types of Membership: National Youth Council and International Non-Governmental Youth Organization, of which there are three levels: Observer, Candidate and Full member. Only full members may vote at the statutory meetings of the Forum. According to the statues: All members have to fulfill the following general criteria: to accept and work for the purpose of the Forum; to be a non-governmental and not for profit organization; to have democratic aims and structures and accept the principles of the European Convention of Human Rights; to fully acknowledge the Statutes of the Forum; to work with young people and have a decision-making body controlled by young people; not to be subject to direction in their decisions by any external authority. National Youth Councils[edit] Presently there are 43 National Youth Councils who are members of the European Youth Forum. Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo and Turkey don't currently have recognized National Youth Councils. National Youth Council members must: a)	be the national coordination body of non-governmental youth organizations in a European State; b)	be open to all democratic youth organizations at the national level To be full members they must be open to all and represent most of the main democratic youth movements and organizations at the national level in that State.

We award every nonprofit that completes the Candid survey full credit for this Beacon, in recognition of their willingness to publicly share this information with the nonprofit and philanthropic communities. Although the data is not evaluated for quality at this time, future iterations of this Beacon will include third party or other data that will serve to validate the information provided by the nonprofit.Analysis and ResearchLike the overall Encompass Rating System, the Culture & Community Beacon is designed to evolve as metrics are developed and ready for integration. Our partnership with Feedback Labs and Guidestar by Candid, and other partners including Fund for Shared Insight, GlobalGiving, and Keystone Accountability, enables us to launch the first version of this beacon with Constituent Feedback information collected on Candid's site.Feedback practices have been shown to support better Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion outcomes, an essential area of assessment that we intend to further expand and develop in the future. Feedback Labs has documented several studies which indicate that beyond achieving organizational goals, nonprofits that are attentive and responsive to concerns and ideas raised by beneficiaries establish stronger relationships with the people they serve, promote greater equity, and empower constituents in ways that can help to ensure better long-term outcomes.

So why should we care for all of God's creation? Christ died to reconcile all of creation to God (Col. 1:20). All of creation belongs to Jesus (Col. 1:16; Ps. 24:1). It fulfills the Great Commandments to love God and love what God loves. (It's hard to love a child with asthma when you're filling her lungs with pollution.) Pollution hurts the poor the most, and Christians are called to care for the poor and the less powerful (Mt. 25:37-40). Thus, caring for all of creation provides a Christian with the deepest sense of joy and contentment since it is part of loving God. We call this ""creation-care."" What is ""creation-care""?Creation-care means caring for all of God's creation by stopping and preventing activities that are harmful (e.g. air and water pollution, species extinction), and participating in activities that further Christ's reconciliation of all of creation to God. Doing creation-care fills us with the joy that only comes from doing the will of God.What about nature worship? As a biblically orthodox Christian organization EEN totally rejects nature worship and pantheism. Nothing is clearer in Scripture: we are to worship only the Creator - never His creation. There is only one God in three Persons - Father, Son, and Holy Spirit - to whom all praise, glory, and honor are to be given. EEN's Evangelical Declaration puts it well: ""Our creating God is prior to and other than creation, yet intimately involved with it, upholding each thing in its freedom, and all things in relationships of intricate complexity. God is transcendent, while lovingly sustaining each creature; and immanent, while wholly other than creation and not to be confused with it."" At the same time that we condemn nature worship, we must not let our zeal to avoid idolatry prevent us from our biblical call to care for all of creation. Indeed, one cannot fully worship the Creator and at the same time destroy His creation, which was brought into being to glorify him. Worshiping the Creator and caring for creation is all part of loving God. They are mutually reinforcing activities. It is actually unbiblical to set one against the other. How are we to treat non-human creation? Are not people more important? Our relationship to the rest of creation is to be based on God's relationship to it and how God wants us to behave towards it. The Bible proclaims that in the beginning God blessed the rest of creation and called it good (Gen. 1:20-25; 31). It exists to praise and glorify Him (e.g. Ps. 19:1-6). Christ sustains all of creation and died to reconcile all of creation to God (Heb. 1:3; Col 1:16, 20). In Christ's future Kingdom the rest of creation will be transformed into a new earth (Rev. 21:1). Thus, the Bible clearly teaches that God values the rest of creation tremendously. At the same time the Bible also proclaims that human beings have a special role and a special responsibility in God's creation since they are created in God's image and have free will. Human beings are called to care for the rest of God's creation, not abuse or destroy it. Good economic stewardship has a significant overlap with good environmental stewardship. God created us to depend on the rest of his creation for our material existence, for the air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat and the raw materials we use for everything else. Creation includes the natural environment, the built environment (including our houses and cities and economies), and all the creatures that depend on those environments. We’re charged with safeguarding the fruitfulness and productivity of creation for all its inhabitants, including people. It is clear from Scripture that God plan and providence allow resources for people and for the rest of God’s creation. We are hard pressed to think of an irresolvable conflict between human needs and care for the rest of creation. The power of God's grace, combined with human creativity and intelligence and our responsibility to fulfill the task of creation-care, provides us with the capability to find peaceful resolutions to what appear to be serious unavoidable conflicts with the rest of creation. (There are clearly conflicts between unlimited human wants and careful stewardship of God’s creation.) Furthermore, environmental problems that harm the rest of creation usually harm human beings as well (e.g. air pollution). Thus, the task of creation-care is part of loving one's neighbor, loving what God loves, and therefore loving God. What is the Evangelical Environmental Network, or EEN?EEN is a biblically based ministry dedicated to the care of God's creation. EEN is made up of both individual members who believe in and support our vital ministry and major evangelical organizations who work with EEN to help equip, educate, disciple, network, and mobilze the church for the care of God's creation.My church has not considered creation care before. What should I do?Take time to learn as much about creation care as possible before you get started. If your church follows a typical small group format, try and find ways to get a conversation started at your church through an evening teaching seminar or a private or church sponsored small group.  Be sure to let us know so we can be praying with you as you discern your next steps.

As a Confessional Lutheran church, the NALC believes all doctrines should and must be judged by the teaching of the Christian Scriptures (the Bible), in keeping with the historic Lutheran Confessions. It was established on August 27, 2010. The group describes itself as embodying the ""theological center of Lutheranism in North America,"" noting that it stands between the more liberal Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) and the more conservative Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS) and other Lutheran church bodies in North America, ""firmly within the global Lutheran mainstream"".[3] Contents 1 History 2 Beliefs 2.1 Core Values 2.2 Doctrine 3 Structure 3.1 Bishops 3.2 Mission districts 4 Relations with other churches 5 References 6 External links History[edit] The North American Lutheran Church was officially formed in August 2010 as the culmination of a process begun by Lutheran CORE (Coalition for Renewal), a confessional Lutheran organization which crosses Lutheran denominational lines. This action came in response to the dissatisfaction of theological conservatives within the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada (ELCIC) who perceived the ELCA/ELCIC as moving away from the authority of the Bible and the Lutheran Confessions. The primary issue of concern for these groups was a 2009 decision by the ELCA which changed its teaching and policy on sexual ethics, allowing clergy / ministers to be in committed same-sex relationships.[4] Following Lutheran CORE's national convocation in September 2009, which resolved to pursue the ""reconfiguration of North American Lutheranism"", the organization's leaders released a plan for organizing the North American Lutheran Church on February 18, 2010.[5] It was felt that a new church body was needed for those Lutheran congregations who declined to join already existing conservative Lutheran groups established earlier in American history or upon earlier Lutheran denominational mergers or splits in 1960, 1962, and 1988. The new church was constituted in Grove City, Ohio, at the Lutheran CORE national convocation of August 26–27, 2010. The convocation was attended by approximately 1,000 participants, including representatives of several conservative American or international denominations, such as the Lutheran Congregations in Mission for Christ, the Ethiopian Evangelical Church Mekane Yesus, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Tanzania, and the Anglican Church in North America. A constitution was adopted and provisional leaders were elected, including the Rev. Paull Spring of State College, Pennsylvania, a retired ELCA bishop, to serve as provisional bishop of the NALC for its first year.[6] The congregations that joined the NALC elected their own leaders at the church body's first annual meeting on August 11–12, 2011, at Upper Arlington Lutheran Church in Hilliard, Ohio. The Rev. John Bradosky of Centerville, Ohio, NALC General Secretary, was elected as bishop of the NALC at that meeting to serve a four-year term. During the NALC's 2015 Annual Convocation in Dallas, Texas, he was re-elected to a second four-year term. In 2018, Bradosky announced his intention to retire at the end of his second term. On August 9, 2019, the Rev. Dr. Dan Selbo, pastor of St. Timothy's Lutheran Church in San Jose, California, was elected and installed as the third bishop of the NALC.[7] Beliefs[edit] The North American Lutheran Church understands itself to be part of the one holy, catholic, and apostolic church and holds that the Scriptures are the highest standard by which doctrine and practice are to be judged. It accepts the ecumenical creeds and the Lutheran Confessions as ""true witnesses to the Word of God"".[8] Core Values[edit] The North American Lutheran Church holds to four core values that shape its identity and church life: ""Christ Centered"", ""Mission Driven"", ""Traditionally Grounded"", and ""Congregationally Focused"": Christ Centered: ""We confess the apostolic faith in Jesus Christ according to the Holy Scriptures. We affirm the authority of the Scriptures as the authoritative source and norm, 'according to which all doctrines should and must be judged' (Formula of Concord). We accept the ecumenical creeds and the Lutheran Confessions as true witnesses to the Word of God."" Mission Driven: ""We believe that the mission of the Church is to preach the Gospel and to make disciples for Christ. We believe that making disciples — in our congregations, in our communities and nations, and around the world — must be a priority of the Church in the present age."" Traditionally Grounded: ""We affirm the ecumenical creeds and the faithful witness of the Church across time and space. We endorse the form and practices of the universal Church that are consistent with Scripture, particularly the office of the ministry and the tradition of worship under Word and Sacrament. We seek dialogue and fellowship with other Lutheran churches and with faithful Christians of other confessions."" Congregationally Focused: ""We strive to be a church that is organized to facilitate the ministries of local congregations in a posture of servanthood and a spirit of partnership, through the provision of resources, connections and information.""[9] Doctrine[edit] The North American Lutheran Church ordains ""qualified persons, both men and women"", to the ordained ministry of Word and Sacrament. Men and women are able to serve in every office of the church, including that of bishop.[10] The Joint Commission on Theology and Doctrine of the NALC and Lutheran CORE endorsed a pro-life stance on abortion in the document ""The Lord Is with You"" – A Word of Counsel to the Church – The Sanctity of Nascent Life"", on December 14, 2012.[11] The North American Lutheran Church became associated with Lutherans For Life, the pro-life ministry of the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod, for the promotion of pro-life activism.[12] The North American Lutheran Church officially disapproves of homosexual relationships and same-sex marriage. Bishop John Bradosky joined other religious leaders in the open letter, ""Marriage and Religious Freedom: Fundamental Goods That Stand or Fall Together – An Open Letter from Religious Leaders in the United States to All Americans"", released on January 12, 2012, on his support for the protection of marriage as the union between a man and a woman and in opposition to same-sex marriage.[13] John Bradosky was one of the signers, among other American religious leaders, of the open letter ""Free Exercise on Religion: Putting Beliefs into Practice"", expressing his support for the Roman Catholic Church in her opposition to the HHS mandate.[14] Structure[edit] The membership of the North American Lutheran Church is composed of congregations and ordained pastors who have subscribed to the NALC constitution.[15] Provided that member congregations' beliefs and practices are compatible with the NALC, congregations can simultaneously affiliate with other Lutheran church bodies. Ministers and elected lay delegates represent their congregations in the annual convocation. This body elects the bishop, executive council, and other leadership positions. It also approves budgetary items and teaching statements.[16] Certain actions of the convocation, such as constitutional amendments and teaching statements, must first be ratified by a majority or, in some cases, a two-thirds majority of NALC congregations before they take effect.[17] The North American Lutheran Church is divided into 28 mission districts, usually based on geographical groupings of congregations.[18] Regional deans, who may also serve as pastors of local congregations, work with the bishop to provide oversight and pastoral care to pastors and congregations within their mission districts.[19] The bishop is an ordained minister elected by the convocation. The bishop serves as ""pastor for the pastors and congregations of the NALC"" and as the church's chief executive officer. Together with the executive council, the bishop authorizes all ordinations and conducts the rite of ordination.[20] The bishop serves for a four-year term and is eligible to serve for a maximum of three consecutive terms. The general secretary is appointed by the bishop and confirmed by the executive council. This officer manages the day-to-day administrative functions of the NALC.[21] The executive council consists of the bishop, four clergy and four lay members. Its duties include implementing the work and policies of the NALC in between sessions of convocation, and its actions are subject to review by the convocation.[22] A seven-member Court of Adjudication, elected by the annual convocation, has jurisdiction to decide appeals of church disciplinary actions and has authority to interpret church governing documents. The convocation can overturn the court's interpretation of a governing document by amending the document in question.[23] Bishops[edit] Paull Spring (provisional) (2010–2011) John Bradosky (2011–2019) Dan Selbo (2019–present) Mission districts[edit] The North American Lutheran Church is divided into the following 28 Mission Districts: Atlantic Mission District Canada Mission District Caribbean and Hispanic Mission District Carolinas Mission District Central Pacific Mission District Eastern South Dakota Mission District Great Rivers Mission District Heartland Mission District Iowa Mission District Michigan Mission District Mid-Northeast Mission District Mid-South Mission District Minkota Mission District Northwest Mission District Ohio Mission Region North West Ohio Mission District South West Ohio Mission District North Central Ohio Mission District North East Ohio Mission District South East Ohio Mission District Rocky Mountain Mission District Sonshine Mission District of Florida Texas Mission Region North Texas Mission District Southeast Texas Mission District Southwest Texas Mission District Southwest Pacific Mission District Virginia Mission District Western Dakotas, Montana and Wyoming Mission District Wisconsin and Upper Michigan Mission District Relations with other churches[edit] The NALC Convocation, held in August 2011, approved unanimously the establishment of a full communion relationship with the Ethiopian Evangelical Church Mekane Yesus.[24] A ""Memorandum of Understanding"" between the NALC and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Tanzania was approved at the Convocation held at August 2013, paving the way for full communion between the two churches.[25] The NALC has established ecumenical dialogue with other Lutheran church bodies, such as the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod, the Lutheran Church-Canada, and the Lutheran Congregations in Mission for Christ, as well as with the Roman Catholic Church, the Anglican Church in North America (ACNA), and the Eastern Orthodox Churches.[26] The NALC passed a request to the Anglican Church in North America to share clergy where there were vacancies, which was accepted. In 2017, the ecumenical consultation of the ACNA and the NALC developed ""Four Pastoral and Educational Affirmations"" on ""Baptism,"" ""Holy Communion,"" ""Holy Scripture,"" and ""Jesus Christ, Gospel, and Justification.""[27] The NALC also started a seminary system called the North American Lutheran Seminary on the campus of Trinity School for Ministry, an Anglican seminary with ties to the Anglican Church in North America. The NALC held an ecumenical summit with representatives of the Anglican Church in North America, the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod, and the Lutheran Church-Canada, on May 3–5, 2013, at the Church of the Holy Communion in Dallas, Texas, on the theme of ""Biblical Teaching on Marriage and Sexuality"". The summit issued the joint document ""An Affirmation of Marriage"", signed by representatives of all the four church bodies, which defined the institution of marriage as the unity between a man and a woman.[28] At its 2012 Convocation, the North American Lutheran Church approved, by the required majority of two thirds of the voters, a resolution to seek membership in the Lutheran World Federation.[29] The application request was not approved by the LWF, remaining in a pending decision, according to a letter issued at May 2014, despite the support of the Lutheran Churches of Ethiopia and Tanzania.[30] The NALC is considering possible associate membership in the International Lutheran Council.[31] In 2015, the NALC met with leaders of Lutheran churches from over a dozen nations around the world for a gathering which would later be called the Global Confessional and Missional Lutheran Forum (Global Forum). In September 2018, the Global Forum met again in Bishoftu, Ethiopia, and on Reformation Day (October 31) they released a letter to the Lutheran worldwide community of churches, referred to as the “Bishoftu Letter to the Churches.” The forum referred to this letter as ""a summary and clarification of the teachings that are our biblical and confessional heritage"" and ""an invitation to Lutherans worldwide to confess, repent, be renewed, reformed and refocused by the Word of God, that together we may be a witness to the world, bringing others to Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior"". The letter also serves as a response to ""certain errors that have recently arisen among and within certain churches of the Lutheran confession"".[32] References[edit] ^ Mark Chavez (Aug. 16, 2018), Report of the General Secretary, Convocation 2018, North American Lutheran Church.

It has the fifth largest gross domestic product (GDP), the sixth largest population, and the 25th largest land area of all U.S. states. Illinois has been noted as a microcosm of the entire United States.[7] With Chicago in northeastern Illinois, small industrial cities and immense agricultural productivity in the north and center of the state, and natural resources such as coal, timber, and petroleum in the south, Illinois has a diverse economic base, and is a major transportation hub. The Port of Chicago connects the state to international ports via two main routes: from the Great Lakes, via the Saint Lawrence Seaway, to the Atlantic Ocean and from the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River, via the Illinois River, through the Illinois Waterway. The Mississippi River, the Ohio River, and the Wabash River form parts of the boundaries of Illinois. For decades, Chicago's O'Hare International Airport has been ranked as one of the world's busiest airports. Illinois has long had a reputation as a bellwether both in social and cultural terms[7] and, through the 1980s, in politics. The capital of Illinois is Springfield, which is located in the central part of the state. Although today Illinois's largest population center is in its northeast, the state's European population grew first in the west as the French settled lands near the Mississippi River, when the region was known as Illinois Country and was part of New France. Following the American Revolutionary War, American settlers began arriving from Kentucky in the 1780s via the Ohio River, and the population grew from south to north. In 1818, Illinois achieved statehood. Following increased commercial activity in the Great Lakes after the construction of the Erie Canal, Chicago was incorporated in the 1830s on the banks of the Chicago River at one of the few natural harbors on the southern section of Lake Michigan.[8] John Deere's invention of the self-scouring steel plow turned Illinois's rich prairie into some of the world's most productive and valuable farmland, attracting immigrant farmers from Germany and Sweden. The Illinois and Michigan Canal (1848) made transportation between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River valley faster and cheaper, and new railroads carried immigrants to new homes in the country's west and shipped commodity crops to the nation's east. The state became a transportation hub for the nation.[9] By 1900, the growth of industrial jobs in the northern cities and coal mining in the central and southern areas attracted immigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe. Illinois was an important manufacturing center during both world wars. The Great Migration from the South established a large community of African Americans in the state, including Chicago, who founded the city's famous jazz and blues cultures.[10][11] Chicago, the center of the Chicago Metropolitan Area, is now recognized as a global city. Chicagoland, Chicago's metropolitan area, encompasses about 65% of the state's population. The most populous metropolitan areas outside the Chicago area include, Metro East (of Greater St. Louis), Peoria and Rockford. Three U.S. presidents have been elected while living in Illinois: Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, and Barack Obama. Additionally, Ronald Reagan, whose political career was based in California, was born and raised in the state. Today, Illinois honors Lincoln with its official state slogan Land of Lincoln, which has been displayed on its license plates since 1954.[12][13] The state is the site of the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield and the future home of the Barack Obama Presidential Center in Chicago.

The name Illiniwek has also been said to mean 'tribe of superior men',[17] which is a false etymology. The name Illinois derives from the Miami-Illinois verb irenwe·wa 'he speaks the regular way'. This was taken into the Ojibwe language, perhaps in the Ottawa dialect, and modified into ilinwe· (pluralized as ilinwe·k). The French borrowed these forms, spelling the /we/ ending as -ois, a transliteration of that sound in the French of that time. The current spelling form, Illinois, began to appear in the early 1670s, when French colonists had settled in the western area. The Illinois's name for themselves, as attested in all three of the French missionary-period dictionaries of Illinois, was Inoka, of unknown meaning and unrelated to the other terms.[18][19] History Main article: History of Illinois Geologic history Main article: Geology of Illinois During the early part of the Paleozoic Era, the area that would one day become Illinois was submerged beneath a shallow sea and located near the Equator. Diverse marine life lived at this time, including trilobites, brachiopods, and crinoids. Changing environmental conditions led to the formation of large coal swamps in the Carboniferous. Illinois was above sea level for at least part of the Mesozoic, but by its end was again submerged by the Western Interior Seaway. This receded by the Eocene Epoch. During the Pleistocene Epoch, vast ice sheets covered much of Illinois, with only the Driftless Area remaining exposed. These glaciers carved the basin of Lake Michigan and left behind traces of ancient glacial lakes and moraines.[20] Pre-European Mississippian copper plate found at the Saddle Site in Union County, Illinois American Indians of successive cultures lived along the waterways of the Illinois area for thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans. The Koster Site has been excavated and demonstrates 7,000 years of continuous habitation. Cahokia, the largest regional chiefdom and Urban Center of the Pre-Columbian Mississippian culture, was located near present-day Collinsville, Illinois. They built an urban complex of more than 100 platform and burial mounds, a 50-acre (20 ha) plaza larger than 35 football fields,[21] and a woodhenge of sacred cedar, all in a planned design expressing the culture's cosmology. Monks Mound, the center of the site, is the largest Pre-Columbian structure north of the Valley of Mexico. It is 100 feet (30 m) high, 951 feet (290 m) long, 836 feet (255 m) wide, and covers 13.8 acres (5.6 ha).[22] It contains about 814,000 cubic yards (622,000 m3) of earth.[23] It was topped by a structure thought to have measured about 105 feet (32 m) in length and 48 feet (15 m) in width, covered an area 5,000 square feet (460 m2), and been as much as 50 feet (15 m) high, making its peak 150 feet (46 m) above the level of the plaza. The finely crafted ornaments and tools recovered by archaeologists at Cahokia include elaborate ceramics, finely sculptured stonework, carefully embossed and engraved copper and mica sheets, and one funeral blanket for an important chief fashioned from 20,000 shell beads. These artifacts indicate that Cahokia was truly an urban center, with clustered housing, markets, and specialists in toolmaking, hide dressing, potting, jewelry making, shell engraving, weaving and salt making.[24] The civilization vanished in the 15th century for unknown reasons, but historians and archeologists have speculated that the people depleted the area of resources. Many indigenous tribes engaged in constant warfare. According to Suzanne Austin Alchon, ""At one site in the central Illinois River valley, one third of all adults died as a result of violent injuries.""[25] The next major power in the region was the Illinois Confederation or Illini, a political alliance.[26] As the Illini declined during the Beaver Wars era, members of the Algonquian-speaking Potawatomi, Miami, Sauk, and other tribes including the Fox (Mesquakie), Ioway, Kickapoo, Mascouten, Piankashaw, Shawnee, Wea, and Winnebago (Ho-Chunk) came into the area from the east and north around the Great Lakes.[27][28] European exploration and settlement prior to 1800 Main articles: New France; Louisiana (New France); Canada (New France); Illinois Country; French and Indian War; Treaty of Paris (1763); Province of Quebec (1763–1791); Indian Reserve (1763); American Revolutionary War; Western theater of the American Revolutionary War; Illinois County, Virginia; Treaty of Paris (1783); Northwest Ordinance; and Northwest Territory Illinois in 1718, approximate modern state area highlighted, from Carte de la Louisiane et du cours du Mississipi by Guillaume de L'Isle[29] French explorers Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet explored the Illinois River in 1673. Marquette soon after founded a mission at the Grand Village of the Illinois in Illinois Country. In 1680, French explorers under René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle and Henri de Tonti constructed a fort at the site of present-day Peoria, and in 1682, a fort atop Starved Rock in today's Starved Rock State Park. French Empire Canadiens came south to settle particularly along the Mississippi River, and Illinois was part of first New France, and then of La Louisiane until 1763, when it passed to the British with their defeat of France in the Seven Years' War. The small French settlements continued, although many French migrated west to Ste. Genevieve and St. Louis, Missouri, to evade British rule.[30] A few British soldiers were posted in Illinois, but few British or American settlers moved there, as the Crown made it part of the territory reserved for Indians west of the Appalachians, and then part of the British Province of Quebec. In 1778, George Rogers Clark claimed Illinois County for Virginia. In a compromise, Virginia (and other states that made various claims) ceded the area to the new United States in the 1780s and it became part of the Northwest Territory, administered by the federal government and later organized as states.[30] 19th century Main articles: Indiana Territory, Organic act § List of organic acts, Illinois Territory, Admission to the Union, and List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union See also: History of Chicago and History of Nauvoo, Illinois Prior to statehood The bell donated by King Louis XV in 1741 to the mission at Kaskaskia. It was later called the ""Liberty Bell of the West"", after it was rung to celebrate U.S. victory in the Revolution The Illinois-Wabash Company was an early claimant to much of Illinois. The Illinois Territory was created on February 3, 1809, with its capital at Kaskaskia, an early French settlement. During the discussions leading up to Illinois's admission to the Union, the proposed northern boundary of the state was moved twice.[31] The original provisions of the Northwest Ordinance had specified a boundary that would have been tangent to the southern tip of Lake Michigan. Such a boundary would have left Illinois with no shoreline on Lake Michigan at all. However, as Indiana had successfully been granted a 10-mile (16 km) northern extension of its boundary to provide it with a usable lakefront, the original bill for Illinois statehood, submitted to Congress on January 23, 1818, stipulated a northern border at the same latitude as Indiana's, which is defined as 10 miles north of the southernmost extremity of Lake Michigan. However, the Illinois delegate, Nathaniel Pope, wanted more, and lobbied to have the boundary moved further north. The final bill passed by Congress included an amendment to shift the border to 42° 30' north, which is approximately 51 miles (82 km) north of the Indiana northern border. This shift added 8,500 square miles (22,000 km2) to the state, including the lead mining region near Galena. More importantly, it added nearly 50 miles of Lake Michigan shoreline and the Chicago River. Pope and others envisioned a canal that would connect the Chicago and Illinois rivers and thus connect the Great Lakes to the Mississippi. The State of Illinois prior to the Civil War In 1818, Illinois became the 21st U.S. state. The southern portion of Illinois Territory was admitted as the state of Illinois, and the rest was joined to Michigan Territory. Old State Capitol: Abraham Lincoln and other area legislators were instrumental in moving the state capitol to centrally located Springfield in 1839. In 1818, Illinois became the 21st U.S. state. The capital remained at Kaskaskia, headquartered in a small building rented by the state. In 1819, Vandalia became the capital, and over the next 18 years, three separate buildings were built to serve successively as the capitol building. In 1837, the state legislators representing Sangamon County, under the leadership of state representative Abraham Lincoln, succeeded in having the capital moved to Springfield,[32] where a fifth capitol building was constructed. A sixth capitol building was erected in 1867, which continues to serve as the Illinois capitol today. Though it was ostensibly a ""free state"", there was nonetheless slavery in Illinois. The ethnic French had owned black slaves since the 1720s, and American settlers had already brought slaves into the area from Kentucky. Slavery was nominally banned by the Northwest Ordinance, but that was not enforced for those already holding slaves. When Illinois became a sovereign state in 1818, the Ordinance no longer applied, and about 900 slaves were held in the state. As the southern part of the state, later known as ""Egypt"" or ""Little Egypt"",[33][34] was largely settled by migrants from the South, the section was hostile to free blacks. Settlers were allowed to bring slaves with them for labor, but, in 1822, state residents voted against making slavery legal. Still, most residents opposed allowing free blacks as permanent residents. Some settlers brought in slaves seasonally or as house servants.[35] The Illinois Constitution of 1848 was written with a provision for exclusionary laws to be passed. In 1853, John A. Logan helped pass a law to prohibit all African Americans, including freedmen, from settling in the state.[36] The winter of 1830–1831 is called the ""Winter of the Deep Snow""; a sudden, deep snowfall blanketed the state, making travel impossible for the rest of the winter, and many travelers perished. Several severe winters followed, including the ""Winter of the Sudden Freeze"". On December 20, 1836, a fast-moving cold front passed through, freezing puddles in minutes and killing many travelers who could not reach shelter. The adverse weather resulted in crop failures in the northern part of the state. The southern part of the state shipped food north, and this may have contributed to its name: ""Little Egypt"", after the Biblical story of Joseph in Egypt supplying grain to his brothers.[37] In 1832, the Black Hawk War was fought in Illinois and present-day Wisconsin between the United States and the Sauk, Fox (Meskwaki), and Kickapoo Indian tribes. It represents the end of Indian resistance to white settlement in the Chicago region.[38] The Indians had been forced to leave their homes and move to Iowa in 1831; when they attempted to return, they were attacked and eventually defeated by U.S. militia. The survivors were forced back to Iowa.[39] By 1839, the Latter Day Saints had founded a utopian city called Nauvoo. Located in Hancock County along the Mississippi River, Nauvoo flourished, and soon rivaled Chicago for the position of the state's largest city. But in 1844, the Latter Day Saint movement founder Joseph Smith was killed in the Carthage Jail, about 30 miles away from Nauvoo. Following a succession crisis (Latter Day Saints), Brigham Young led most Latter Day Saints out of Illinois in a mass exodus to present-day Utah; after close to six years of rapid development, Nauvoo rapidly declined afterward. After it was established in 1833, Chicago gained prominence as a Great Lakes port, and then as an Illinois and Michigan Canal port after 1848, and as a rail hub soon afterward. By 1857, Chicago was Illinois's largest city.[30] With the tremendous growth of mines and factories in the state in the 19th century, Illinois was the ground for the formation of labor unions in the United States. In 1847, after lobbying by Dorothea L. Dix, Illinois became one of the first states to establish a system of state-supported treatment of mental illness and disabilities, replacing local almshouses. Dix came into this effort after having met J. O. King, a Jacksonville, Illinois businessman, who invited her to Illinois, where he had been working to build an asylum for the insane. With the lobbying expertise of Dix, plans for the Jacksonville State Hospital (now known as the Jacksonville Developmental Center) were signed into law on March 1, 1847.[40] Civil War and after Main article: Illinois in the American Civil War Embarkation of Union troops from Cairo on January 10, 1862 During the American Civil War, Illinois ranked fourth in men who served (more than 250,000) in the Union Army, a figure surpassed by only New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. Beginning with President Abraham Lincoln's first call for troops and continuing throughout the war, Illinois mustered 150 infantry regiments, which were numbered from the 7th to the 156th regiments. Seventeen cavalry regiments were also gathered, as well as two light artillery regiments.[41] The town of Cairo, at the southern tip of the state at the confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers, served as a strategically important supply base and training center for the Union army. For several months, both General Grant and Admiral Foote had headquarters in Cairo. During the Civil War, and more so afterwards, Chicago's population skyrocketed, which increased its prominence. The Pullman Strike and Haymarket Riot, in particular, greatly influenced the development of the American labor movement. From Sunday, October 8, 1871, until Tuesday, October 10, 1871, the Great Chicago Fire burned in downtown Chicago, destroying four square miles (10 km2).[42] 20th century At the turn of the 20th century, Illinois had a population of nearly 5 million. Many people from other parts of the country were attracted to the state by employment caused by the expanding industrial base. Whites were 98% of the state's population.[43] Bolstered by continued immigration from southern and eastern Europe, and by the African-American Great Migration from the South, Illinois grew and emerged as one of the most important states in the union. By the end of the century, the population had reached 12.4 million. The Century of Progress World's fair was held at Chicago in 1933. Oil strikes in Marion County and Crawford County led to a boom in 1937, and by 1939, Illinois ranked fourth in U.S. oil production. Illinois manufactured 6.1 percent of total United States military armaments produced during World War II, ranking seventh among the 48 states.[44] Chicago became an ocean port with the opening of the Saint Lawrence Seaway in 1959. The seaway and the Illinois Waterway connected Chicago to both the Mississippi River and the Atlantic Ocean. In 1960, Ray Kroc opened the first McDonald's franchise in Des Plaines (which still exists as a museum, with a working McDonald's across the street). Illinois had a prominent role in the emergence of the nuclear age. In 1942, as part of the Manhattan Project, the University of Chicago conducted the first sustained nuclear chain reaction. In 1957, Argonne National Laboratory, near Chicago, activated the first experimental nuclear power generating system in the United States. By 1960, the first privately financed nuclear plant in the United States, Dresden 1, was dedicated near Morris. In 1967, Fermilab, a national nuclear research facility near Batavia, opened a particle accelerator, which was the world's largest for over 40 years. With eleven plants currently operating, Illinois leads all states in the amount of electricity generated from nuclear power.[45][46] In 1961, Illinois became the first state in the nation to adopt the recommendation of the American Law Institute and pass a comprehensive criminal code revision that repealed the law against sodomy. The code also abrogated common law crimes and established an age of consent of 18.[47] The state's fourth constitution was adopted in 1970, replacing the 1870 document.[48] The first Farm Aid concert was held in Champaign to benefit American farmers, in 1985. The worst upper Mississippi River flood of the century, the Great Flood of 1993, inundated many towns and thousands of acres of farmland.[30] 21st century On August 28, 2017, Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner signed a bill into law that prohibited state and local police from arresting anyone solely due to their immigration status or due to federal detainers.[49][50] Some fellow Republicans criticized Rauner for his action, claiming the bill made Illinois a sanctuary state.[51] Geography Main article: Geography of Illinois Further information: List of ecoregions in Illinois Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States and is one of the eight states and Ontario, Canada, in the Great Lakes region of North America. Boundaries Illinois's eastern border with Indiana consists of a north–south line at 87° 31′ 30″ west longitude in Lake Michigan at the north, to the Wabash River in the south above Post Vincennes. The Wabash River continues as the eastern/southeastern border with Indiana until the Wabash enters the Ohio River. This marks the beginning of Illinois's southern border with Kentucky, which runs along the northern shoreline of the Ohio River.[52] Most of the western border with Missouri and Iowa is the Mississippi River; Kaskaskia is an exclave of Illinois, lying west of the Mississippi and reachable only from Missouri. The state's northern border with Wisconsin is fixed at 42° 30′ north latitude. The northeastern border of Illinois lies in Lake Michigan, within which Illinois shares a water boundary with the state of Michigan, as well as Wisconsin and Indiana.[27] Topography Charles Mound, the highest natural point in Illinois at 1,235 feet, is located in the Driftless Area in the northwestern part of the state. Though Illinois lies entirely in the Interior Plains, it does have some minor variation in its elevation. In extreme northwestern Illinois, the Driftless Area, a region of unglaciated and therefore higher and more rugged topography, occupies a small part of the state. Southern Illinois includes the hilly areas around the Shawnee National Forest. Charles Mound, located in the Driftless region, has the state's highest natural elevation above sea level at 1,235 feet (376 m). Other highlands include the Shawnee Hills in the south, and there is varying topography along its rivers; the Illinois River bisects the state northeast to southwest. The floodplain on the Mississippi River from Alton to the Kaskaskia River is known as the American Bottom. Divisions At 279 feet above sea level,[53] the lowest elevation point in the state is located near Cairo and the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. Illinois has three major geographical divisions. Northern Illinois is dominated by Chicago metropolitan area, or Chicagoland, which is the city of Chicago and its suburbs, and the adjoining exurban area into which the metropolis is expanding. As defined by the federal government, the Chicago metro area includes several counties in Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin, and has a population of over 9.8 million. Chicago itself is a cosmopolitan city, densely populated, industrialized, the transportation hub of the nation, and settled by a wide variety of ethnic groups. The city of Rockford, Illinois's third-largest city and center of the state's fourth largest metropolitan area, sits along Interstates 39 and 90 some 75 miles (121 km) northwest of Chicago. The Quad Cities region, located along the Mississippi River in northern Illinois, had a population of 381,342 in 2011. The midsection of Illinois is the second major division, called Central Illinois. It is an area of mainly prairie and known as the Heart of Illinois. It is characterized by small towns and medium–small cities. The western section (west of the Illinois River) was originally part of the Military Tract of 1812 and forms the conspicuous western bulge of the state. Agriculture, particularly corn and soybeans, as well as educational institutions and manufacturing centers, figure prominently in Central Illinois. Cities include Peoria; Springfield, the state capital; Quincy; Decatur; Bloomington-Normal; and Champaign-Urbana.[27] The third division is Southern Illinois, comprising the area south of U.S. Route 50, including Little Egypt, near the juncture of the Mississippi River and Ohio River. Southern Illinois is the site of the ancient city of Cahokia, as well as the site of the first state capital at Kaskaskia, which today is separated from the rest of the state by the Mississippi River.[27][54] This region has a somewhat warmer winter climate, different variety of crops (including some cotton farming in the past), more rugged topography (due to the area remaining unglaciated during the Illinoian Stage, unlike most of the rest of the state), as well as small-scale oil deposits and coal mining. The Illinois suburbs of St. Louis, such as East St. Louis, are located in this region, and collectively, they are known as the Metro-East. The other somewhat significant concentration of population in Southern Illinois is the Carbondale-Marion-Herrin, Illinois Combined Statistical Area centered on Carbondale and Marion, a two-county area that is home to 123,272 residents.[27] A portion of southeastern Illinois is part of the extended Evansville, Indiana, Metro Area, locally referred to as the Tri-State with Indiana and Kentucky. Seven Illinois counties are in the area. In addition to these three, largely latitudinally defined divisions, all of the region outside the Chicago Metropolitan area is often called ""downstate"" Illinois. This term is flexible, but is generally meant to mean everything outside the influence of the Chicago area. Thus, some cities in Northern Illinois, such as DeKalb, which is west of Chicago, and Rockford—which is actually north of Chicago—are sometimes incorrectly considered to be 'downstate'. Climate Main article: Climate of Illinois See also: St. Louis tornado history Köppen climate types of Illinois Illinois has a climate that varies widely throughout the year. Because of its nearly 400-mile distance between its northernmost and southernmost extremes, as well as its mid-continental situation, most of Illinois has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfa), with hot, humid summers and cold winters. The southern part of the state, from about Carbondale southward, has a humid subtropical climate (Koppen Cfa), with more moderate winters. Average yearly precipitation for Illinois varies from just over 48 inches (1,219 mm) at the southern tip to around 35 inches (889 mm) in the northern portion of the state. Normal annual snowfall exceeds 38 inches (965 mm) in the Chicago area, while the southern portion of the state normally receives less than 14 inches (356 mm).[55] The all-time high temperature was 117 °F (47 °C), recorded on July 14, 1954, at East St. Louis, and the all-time low temperature was −38 °F (−39 °C), recorded on January 31, 2019, during the January 2019 North American cold wave at a weather station near Mount Carroll,[56][57] and confirmed on March 5, 2019.[58] This followed the previous record of −36 °F (−38 °C) recorded on January 5, 1999, near Congerville.[58] Prior to the Mount Carroll record, a temperature of −37 °F (−38 °C) was recorded on January 15, 2009, at Rochelle, but at a weather station not subjected to the same quality control as official records.[59][60] Illinois averages approximately 51 days of thunderstorm activity a year, which ranks somewhat above average in the number of thunderstorm days for the United States. Illinois is vulnerable to tornadoes, with an average of 35 occurring annually, which puts much of the state at around five tornadoes per 10,000 square miles (30,000 km2) annually.[61] While tornadoes are no more powerful in Illinois than other states, some of Tornado Alley's deadliest tornadoes on record have occurred in the state. The Tri-State Tornado of 1925 killed 695 people in three states; 613 of the victims died in Illinois.[62] Monthly Normal High and Low Temperatures For Various Illinois Cities City January February March April May June July August September October November December Cairo[63] 43/25 48/29 59/37 70/46 78/57 86/67 90/71 88/69 81/61 71/49 57/39 46/30 Chicago[64] 31/16 36/21 47/31 59/42 70/52 81/61 85/65 83/65 75/57 64/45 48/34 36/22 Edwardsville[65] 36/19 42/24 52/34 64/45 75/55 84/64 89/69 86/66 79/58 68/46 53/35 41/25 Moline[66] 30/12 36/18 48/29 62/39 73/50 83/60 86/64 84/62 76/53 64/42 48/30 34/18 Peoria[67] 31/14 37/20 49/30 62/40 73/51 82/60 86/65 84/63 77/54 64/42 49/31 36/20 Rockford[68] 27/11 33/16 46/27 59/37 71/48 80/58 83/63 81/61 74/52 62/40 46/29 32/17 Springfield[69] 33/17 39/22 51/32 63/42 74/53 83/62 86/66 84/64 78/55 67/44 51/34 38/23 Demographics Density map displaying the population of Illinois Historical population Census Pop. %± 18002,458—181012,282399.7%182055,211349.5%1830157,445185.2%1840476,183202.4%1850851,47078.8%18601,711,951101.1%18702,539,89148.4%18803,077,87121.2%18903,826,35224.3%19004,821,55026.0%19105,638,59116.9%19206,485,28015.0%19307,630,65417.7%19407,897,2413.5%19508,712,17610.3%196010,081,15815.7%197011,113,97610.2%198011,426,5182.8%199011,430,6020.0%200012,419,2938.6%201012,830,6323.3%202012,812,508−0.1%Source:1910–2020[70] The United States Census Bureau found that the population of Illinois was 12,812,508 in the 2020 United States Census, moving from the fifth-largest state to the sixth-largest state (losing out to Pennsylvania). Illinois' population slightly declined in 2020 from the 2010 United States Census by just over 18,000 residents and the overall population was quite higher than recent Census estimates.[71] Illinois is the most populous state in the Midwest region. Chicago, the third-most populous city in the United States, is the center of the Chicago metropolitan area or Chicagoland, as this area is nicknamed. Although Chicagoland comprises only 9% of the land area of the state, it contains 65% of the state's residents. The losses of population anticipated from the 2020 Census results do not arise from the Chicago metro area; rather the declines are from the Downstate counties.[72] According to the 2010 Census, the racial composition of the state was: 71.5% White American (63.7% non-Hispanic white, 7.8% White Hispanic) 14.5% Black or African American 0.3% American Indian and Alaska Native 4.6% Asian American 2.3% Multiracial American 6.8% some other race In the same year 15.8% of the total population was of Hispanic or Latino origin (they may be of any race).[73] Illinois Racial Breakdown of Population Racial composition 1990[74] 2000[75] 2010[76] White 78.3% 73.5% 71.5% Black 14.8% 15.1% 14.5% Asian 2.5% 3.4% 4.6% Native 0.2% 0.2% 0.3% Native Hawaiian andother Pacific Islander — — — Other race 4.2% 5.8% 6.7% Two or more races — 1.9% 2.3% 2019 American Community Survey Racial Makeup of Illinois (2019)[77] White alone (71.37%)  Black alone (14.13%)  Native American alone (0.26%)  Asian Alone (5.67%)  Pacific Islander Alone (0.04%)  Some other race alone (5.76%)  Two or more races (2.78%) Racial/Ethnic Makeup of Illinois excluding Hispanics from racial categories (2019)[77]NH=Non-Hispanic White NH (60.69%)  Black NH (13.88%)  Native American NH (0.10%)  Asian NH (5.60%)  Pacific Islander NH (0.02%)  Other NH (0.17%)  Two or more races NH (2.03%)  Hispanic Any Race (17.49%) Racial Makeup of Hispanics in Illinois (2019)[77] White alone (61.05%)  Black alone (1.40%)  Native American alone (0.89%)  Asian Alone (0.36%)  Pacific Islander Alone (0.07%)  Other race alone (31.96%)  Two or more races (4.28%) According to 2019 U.S. Census Bureau estimates, Illinois's population was 71.4% White (60.7% Non-Hispanic White), 5.6% Asian, 0.2% Some Other Race, 13.9% Black or African American, 0.1% Native Americans and Alaskan Native, 0.1% Pacific Islander and 2.0% from two or more races.[77] The White population continues to remain the largest racial category in Illinois as Hispanics primarily identify as White (61.1%) with others identifying as Some Other Race (32.0%), Multiracial (4.3%), Black (1.4%), American Indian and Alaskan Native (0.2%), Asian (0.1%), and Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (0.1%).[77] By ethnicity, 17.5% of the total population is Hispanic-Latino (of any race) and 82.5% is Non-Hispanic (of any race). If treated as a separate category, Hispanics are the largest minority group in Illinois.[77] The state's most populous ethnic group, non-Hispanic white, has declined from 83.5% in 1970[78] to 60.90% in 2018.[79] As of 2011[update], 49.4% of Illinois's population younger than age 1 were minorities (Note: Children born to white Hispanics or to a sole full or partial minority parent are counted as minorities).[80] At the 2007 estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau, there were 1,768,518 foreign-born inhabitants of the state or 13.8% of the population, with 48.4% from Latin America, 24.6% from Asia, 22.8% from Europe, 2.9% from Africa, 1.2% from Canada, and 0.2% from Oceania. Of the foreign-born population, 43.7% were naturalized U.S. citizens, and 56.3% were not U.S. citizens.[81] In 2007, 6.9% of Illinois's population was reported as being under age 5, 24.9% under age 18 and 12.1% were age 65 and over. Females made up approximately 50.7% of the population.[82] According to the 2007 estimates, 21.1% of the population had German ancestry, 13.3% had Irish ancestry, 8% had British ancestry, 7.9% had Polish ancestry, 6.4% had Italian ancestry, 4.6% listed themselves as American, 2.4% had Swedish ancestry, 2.2% had French ancestry, other than Basque, 1.6% had Dutch ancestry, and 1.4% had Norwegian ancestry.[81] Illinois also has large numbers of African Americans and Latinos (mostly Mexicans and Puerto Ricans). Chicago, along the shores of Lake Michigan, is the nation's third largest city. In 2000, 23.3% of Illinois's population lived in the city of Chicago, 43.3% in Cook County, and 65.6% in the counties of the Chicago metropolitan area: Will, DuPage, Kane, Lake, and McHenry counties, as well as Cook County. The remaining population lives in the smaller cities and rural areas that dot the state's plains. As of 2000, the state's center of population was at 41°16′42″N 88°22′49″W﻿ / ﻿41.278216°N 88.380238°W﻿ / 41.278216; -88.380238, located in Grundy County, northeast of the village of Mazon.[27][30][54][83] Birth data Births do not add up, because Hispanics are counted both by ethnicity and by race.

Urban areas See also: Illinois statistical areas, List of cities in Illinois, and List of towns and villages in Illinois Chicago is the largest city in the state and the third-most populous city in the United States, with its 2010 population of 2,695,598. The U.S. Census Bureau currently lists seven other cities with populations of over 100,000 within Illinois. Based upon the Census Bureau's official 2010 population:[91] Aurora, a Chicago satellite town that eclipsed Rockford for the title of second-most populous city in Illinois; its 2010 population was 197,899. Rockford, at 152,871, is the third-largest city in the state, and is the largest city in the state not located within the Chicago suburbs. Joliet, located in metropolitan Chicago, is the fourth-largest city in the state, with a population of 147,433. Naperville, a suburb of Chicago, is fifth with 141,853. Naperville and Aurora share a boundary along Illinois Route 59. Springfield, the state's capital, comes in as sixth-most populous with 117,352 residents. Peoria, which decades ago was the second-most populous city in the state, is seventh with 115,007. The eighth-largest and final city in the 100,000 club is Elgin, a northwest suburb of Chicago, with a 2010 population of 108,188. The most populated city in the state south of Springfield is Belleville, with 44,478 people at the 2010 census. It is located in the Illinois portion of Greater St. Louis (often called the Metro-East area), which has a rapidly growing population of over 700,000. Other major urban areas include the Champaign-Urbana Metropolitan Area, which has a combined population of almost 230,000 people, the Illinois portion of the Quad Cities area with about 215,000 people, and the Bloomington-Normal area with a combined population of over 165,000. vte Largest cities or towns in Illinois2019 U.S. Census Bureau Estimate[92] Rank Name County Pop.

Nearly 80% of people in Illinois speak English natively, and most of the rest speak it fluently as a second language.[94] A number of dialects of American English are spoken, ranging from Inland Northern American English and African-American English around Chicago, to Midland American English in Central Illinois, to Southern American English in the far south. Over 20% of Illinoians speak a language other than English at home, of which Spanish is by far the most widespread, at more than 12% of the total population.[95] A sizeable number of Polish speakers is present in the Chicago Metropolitan Area. Illinois Country French has mostly gone extinct in Illinois, although it is still celebrated in the French Colonial Historic District. Religion Religion in Illinois (2014)[96][97] Protestantism (43%)  Roman Catholicism (28%)  No religion (22%)  Judaism (2%)  Islam (1%)  Buddhism (1%)  Hinduism (1%)  Other religion (1%)  No response given/Unknown (1%) Christianity Roman Catholics constitute the single largest religious denomination in Illinois; they are heavily concentrated in and around Chicago, and account for nearly 30% of the state's population.[98] However, taken together as a group, the various Protestant denominations comprise a greater percentage of the state's population than do Catholics. In 2010 Catholics in Illinois numbered 3,648,907. The largest Protestant denominations were the United Methodist Church with 314,461, and the Southern Baptist Convention, with 283,519 members. Illinois has one of the largest concentrations of Missouri Synod Lutherans in the United States. Illinois played an important role in the early Latter Day Saint movement, with Nauvoo, Illinois, becoming a gathering place for Mormons in the early 1840s. Nauvoo was the location of the succession crisis, which led to the separation of the Mormon movement into several Latter Day Saint sects. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the largest of the sects to emerge from the Mormon schism, has more than 55,000 adherents in Illinois today.[99] Other Abrahamic religious communities A significant number of adherents of other Abrahamic faiths can be found in Illinois. Largely concentrated in the Chicago metropolitan area, followers of the Muslim, Baháʼí, and Jewish religions all call the state home.[100] Muslims constituted the largest non-Christian group, with 359,264 adherents.[101] Illinois has the largest concentration of Muslims by state in the country, with 2,800 Muslims per 100,000 citizens.[102] The largest and oldest surviving Baháʼí House of Worship in the world is located in Wilmette, Illinois, The Chicago area has a very large Jewish community, particularly in the suburbs of Skokie, Buffalo Grove, Highland Park, and surrounding suburbs. Former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel is the Windy City's first Jewish mayor. Other religions Chicago is also home to a very large population of Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, and Buddhists.[100] The Baháʼí House of Worship in Wilmette is the center of that religion's worship in North America.[103] Economy Main article: Economy of Illinois See also: List of Illinois locations by per capita income The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago at the heart of Chicago's financial center The dollar gross state product for Illinois was estimated to be US$909 billion in 2019.[104] The state's 2019 per capita gross state product was estimated to be around $72,000.[105] As of February 2019, the unemployment rate in Illinois reached 4.2%.[106] Illinois's minimum wage will rise to $15 per hour by 2025, making it one of the highest in the nation.[107] Agriculture Main article: Agriculture in Illinois Illinois's major agricultural outputs are corn, soybeans, hogs, cattle, dairy products, and wheat. In most years, Illinois is either the first or second state for the highest production of soybeans, with a harvest of 427.7 million bushels (11.64 million metric tons) in 2008, after Iowa's production of 444.82 million bushels (12.11 million metric tons).[108] Illinois ranks second in U.S. corn production with more than 1.5 billion bushels produced annually.[109] With a production capacity of 1.5 billion gallons per year, Illinois is a top producer of ethanol, ranking third in the United States in 2011.[110] Illinois is a leader in food manufacturing and meat processing.[111] Although Chicago may no longer be ""Hog Butcher for the World"", the Chicago area remains a global center for food manufacture and meat processing,[111] with many plants, processing houses, and distribution facilities concentrated in the area of the former Union Stock Yards.[112] Illinois also produces wine, and the state is home to two American viticultural areas. In the area of The Meeting of the Great Rivers Scenic Byway, peaches and apples are grown. The German immigrants from agricultural backgrounds who settled in Illinois in the mid- to late 19th century are in part responsible for the profusion of fruit orchards in that area of Illinois.[113] Illinois's universities are actively researching alternative agricultural products as alternative crops. Manufacturing Illinois is one of the nation's manufacturing leaders, boasting annual value added productivity by manufacturing of over $107 billion in 2006. As of 2011[update], Illinois is ranked as the 4th-most productive manufacturing state in the country, behind California, Texas, and Ohio.[114] About three-quarters of the state's manufacturers are located in the Northeastern Opportunity Return Region, with 38 percent of Illinois's approximately 18,900 manufacturing plants located in Cook County. As of 2006, the leading manufacturing industries in Illinois, based upon value-added, were chemical manufacturing ($18.3 billion), machinery manufacturing ($13.4 billion), food manufacturing ($12.9 billion), fabricated metal products ($11.5 billion), transportation equipment ($7.4 billion), plastics and rubber products ($7.0 billion), and computer and electronic products ($6.1 billion).[115] Services By the early 2000s, Illinois's economy had moved toward a dependence on high-value-added services, such as financial trading, higher education, law, logistics, and medicine. In some cases, these services clustered around institutions that hearkened back to Illinois's earlier economies. For example, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a trading exchange for global derivatives, had begun its life as an agricultural futures market. Other important non-manufacturing industries include publishing, tourism, and energy production and distribution. Investments Venture capitalists funded a total of approximately $62 billion in the U.S. economy in 2016. Of this amount, Illinois-based companies received approximately $1.1 billion. Similarly, in FY 2016, the federal government spent $461 billion on contracts in the U.S. Of this amount, Illinois-based companies received approximately $8.7 billion.[116] Energy See also: List of power stations in Illinois and Solar power in Illinois Illinois is a net importer of fuels for energy, despite large coal resources and some minor oil production. Illinois exports electricity, ranking fifth among states in electricity production and seventh in electricity consumption.[117] Coal The coal industry of Illinois has its origins in the middle 19th century, when entrepreneurs such as Jacob Loose discovered coal in locations such as Sangamon County. Jacob Bunn contributed to the development of the Illinois coal industry, and was a founder and owner of the Western Coal & Mining Company of Illinois. About 68% of Illinois has coal-bearing strata of the Pennsylvanian geologic period. According to the Illinois State Geological Survey, 211 billion tons of bituminous coal are estimated to lie under the surface, having a total heating value greater than the estimated oil deposits in the Arabian Peninsula.[118] However, this coal has a high sulfur content, which causes acid rain, unless special equipment is used to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions.[27][30][54] Many Illinois power plants are not equipped to burn high-sulfur coal. In 1999, Illinois produced 40.4 million tons of coal, but only 17 million tons (42%) of Illinois coal was consumed in Illinois. Most of the coal produced in Illinois is exported to other states and countries. In 2008, Illinois exported three million tons of coal, and was projected to export nine million in 2011, as demand for energy grows in places such as China, India, and elsewhere in Asia and Europe.[119] As of 2010[update], Illinois was ranked third in recoverable coal reserves at producing mines in the nation.[110] Most of the coal produced in Illinois is exported to other states, while much of the coal burned for power in Illinois (21 million tons in 1998) is mined in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming.[117] Mattoon was chosen as the site for the Department of Energy's FutureGen project, a 275-megawatt experimental zero emission coal-burning power plant that the DOE just gave a second round of funding. In 2010, after a number of setbacks, the city of Mattoon backed out of the project.[120] Petroleum Illinois is a leading refiner of petroleum in the American Midwest, with a combined crude oil distillation capacity of nearly 900,000 barrels per day (140,000 m3/d). However, Illinois has very limited crude oil proved reserves that account for less than 1% of the U.S. total reserves. Residential heating is 81% natural gas compared to less than 1% heating oil. Illinois is ranked 14th in oil production among states, with a daily output of approximately 28,000 barrels (4,500 m3) in 2005.[121][122] Nuclear power Main article: Nuclear power in the United States Byron Nuclear Generating Station in Ogle County Average annual wind power distribution for Illinois, 50 m (160 ft) height above ground (2009) Nuclear power arguably began in Illinois with the Chicago Pile-1, the world's first artificial self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction in the world's first nuclear reactor, built on the University of Chicago campus. There are six operating nuclear power plants in Illinois: Braidwood, Byron, Clinton, Dresden, LaSalle, and Quad Cities.[123] With the exception of the single-unit Clinton plant, each of these facilities has two reactors. Three reactors have been permanently shut down and are in various stages of decommissioning: Dresden-1 and Zion-1 and 2. Illinois ranked first in the nation in 2010 in both nuclear capacity and nuclear generation. Generation from its nuclear power plants accounted for 12 percent of the nation's total.[110] In 2007, 48% of Illinois's electricity was generated using nuclear power.[124] The Morris Operation is the only de facto high-level radioactive waste storage site in the United States. Wind power Main article: Wind power in Illinois Illinois has seen growing interest in the use of wind power for electrical generation.[125] Most of Illinois was rated in 2009 as ""marginal or fair"" for wind energy production by the U.S. Department of Energy, with some western sections rated ""good"" and parts of the south rated ""poor"".[126] These ratings are for wind turbines with 50-meter (160 ft) hub heights; newer wind turbines are taller, enabling them to reach stronger winds farther from the ground. As a result, more areas of Illinois have become prospective wind farm sites. As of September 2009, Illinois had 1116.06 MW of installed wind power nameplate capacity with another 741.9 MW under construction.[127] Illinois ranked ninth among U.S. states in installed wind power capacity, and sixteenth by potential capacity.[127] Large wind farms in Illinois include Twin Groves, Rail Splitter, EcoGrove, and Mendota Hills.[127] As of 2007, wind energy represented only 1.7% of Illinois's energy production, and it was estimated that wind power could provide 5–10% of the state's energy needs.[128][129] Also, the Illinois General Assembly mandated in 2007 that by 2025, 25% of all electricity generated in Illinois is to come from renewable resources.[130] Biofuels Illinois is ranked second in corn production among U.S. states, and Illinois corn is used to produce 40% of the ethanol consumed in the United States.[109] The Archer Daniels Midland corporation in Decatur, Illinois, is the world's leading producer of ethanol from corn. The National Corn-to-Ethanol Research Center (NCERC), the world's only facility dedicated to researching the ways and means of converting corn (maize) to ethanol is located on the campus of Southern Illinois University Edwardsville.[131][132] University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign is one of the partners in the Energy Biosciences Institute (EBI), a $500 million biofuels research project funded by petroleum giant BP.[133][134] Taxes Tax is collected by the Illinois Department of Revenue. State income tax is calculated by multiplying net income by a flat rate. In 1990, that rate was set at 3%, but in 2010, the General Assembly voted for a temporary increase in the rate to 5%; the new rate went into effect on January 1, 2011; the personal income rate partially sunset on January 1, 2015, to 3.75%, while the corporate income tax fell to 5.25%.[135][136] Illinois failed to pass a budget from 2015 to 2017, after the 736-day budget impasse, a budget was passed in Illinois after lawmakers overturned Governor Bruce Rauner's veto; this budget raised the personal income rate to 4.95% and the corporate rate to 7%.[137] There are two rates for state sales tax: 6.25% for general merchandise and 1% for qualifying food, drugs, and medical appliances.[138] The property tax is a major source of tax revenue for local government taxing districts. The property tax is a local—not state—tax, imposed by local government taxing districts, which include counties, townships, municipalities, school districts, and special taxation districts. The property tax in Illinois is imposed only on real property.[27][30][54] On May 1, 2019, the Illinois Senate voted to approve a constitutional amendment that would have stricken language from the Illinois Constitution requiring a flat state income tax, in a 73–44 vote. If approved, the amendment would have allowed the state legislature to impose a graduated income tax based on annual income. The governor, J.B. Pritzker, approved the bill on May 27, 2019. It was scheduled for a 2020 general election ballot vote[139][140] and required 60 percent voter approval to effectively amend the state constitution.[141] The amendment was not approved by Illinoisans, with 55.1% of voters voting ""No"" on approval and 44.9% voting ""Yes.""[142] As of 2017 Chicago had the highest state and local sales tax rate for a U.S. city with a populations above 200,000, at 10.250%.[143] The state of Illinois has the second highest rate of real estate tax: 2.31%, which is second only to New Jersey at 2.44%.[144] Toll roads are a de facto user tax on the citizens and visitors to the state of Illinois. Illinois ranks seventh out of the 11 states with the most miles of toll roads, at 282.1 miles. Chicago ranks fourth in most expensive toll roads in America by the mile, with the Chicago Skyway charging 51.2 cents per mile.[145] Illinois also has the 11th highest gasoline tax by state, at 37.5 cents per gallon.[146] Culture Museums For a more comprehensive list, see List of museums in Illinois. Illinois has numerous museums; the greatest concentration of these are in Chicago. Several museums in Chicago are ranked as some of the best in the world. These include the John G. Shedd Aquarium, the Field Museum of Natural History, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Adler Planetarium, and the Museum of Science and Industry. The modern Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield is the largest and most attended presidential library in the country. The Illinois State Museum boasts a collection of 13.5 million objects that tell the story of Illinois life, land, people, and art. The ISM is among only 5% of the nation's museums that are accredited by the American Alliance of Museums. Other historical museums in the state include the Polish Museum of America in Chicago; Magnolia Manor in Cairo; Easley Pioneer Museum in Ipava; the Elihu Benjamin Washburne; Ulysses S. Grant Homes, both in Galena; and the Chanute Air Museum, located on the former Chanute Air Force Base in Rantoul. The Chicago metropolitan area also hosts two zoos: The Brookfield Zoo, located about ten miles west of the city center in suburban Brookfield, contains more than 2,300 animals and covers 216 acres (87 ha). The Lincoln Park Zoo is located in Lincoln Park on Chicago's North Side, approximately 3 miles (4.8 km) north of the Loop. The zoo accounts for more than 35 acres (14 ha) of the park. Illinois Museums Vandalia State House State Historic Site in Vandalia The Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago Magnolia Manor is a Victorian period historic house museum in Cairo. Lincoln Home National Historic Site in Springfield The Polish Museum of America in Chicago A Railway Post Office preserved at the Illinois Railway Museum in Union Music Main article: Music of Illinois Illinois is a leader in music education, having hosted the Midwest Clinic International Band and Orchestra Conference since 1946, as well being home to the Illinois Music Educators Association (IMEA), one of the largest professional music educator's organizations in the country. Each summer since 2004, Southern Illinois University Carbondale has played host to the Southern Illinois Music Festival, which presents dozens of performances throughout the region. Past featured artists include the Eroica Trio and violinist David Kim. Chicago, in the northeast corner of the state, is a major center for music[147] in the midwestern United States where distinctive forms of blues (greatly responsible for the future creation of rock and roll), and house music, a genre of electronic dance music, were developed. The Great Migration of poor black workers from the South into the industrial cities brought traditional jazz and blues music to the city, resulting in Chicago blues and ""Chicago-style"" Dixieland jazz. Notable blues artists included Muddy Waters, Junior Wells, Howlin' Wolf and both Sonny Boy Williamsons; jazz greats included Nat King Cole, Gene Ammons, Benny Goodman, and Bud Freeman. Chicago is also well known for its soul music. In the early 1930s, Gospel music began to gain popularity in Chicago due to Thomas A. Dorsey's contributions at Pilgrim Baptist Church. In the 1980s and 1990s, heavy rock, punk, and hip hop also became popular in Chicago. Orchestras in Chicago include the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Lyric Opera of Chicago, and the Chicago Sinfonietta.[148] Movies John Hughes, who moved from Grosse Pointe to Northbrook, based many films of his in Chicago, and its suburbs. Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Home Alone, The Breakfast Club, and all his films take place in the fictional Shermer, Illinois (the original name of Northbrook was Shermerville, and Hughes's High School, Glenbrook North High School, is on Shermer Road). Most locations in his films include Glenbrook North, the former Maine North High School, the Ben Rose House in Highland Park, and the famous Home Alone house in Winnetka, Illinois. Sports For a more comprehensive list, see List of professional sports teams in Illinois. Soldier Field, Chicago Major league sports As one of the United States' major metropolises, all major sports leagues have teams headquartered in Chicago. Two Major League Baseball teams are located in the state. The Chicago Cubs of the National League play in the second-oldest major league stadium (Wrigley Field) and are widely known for having the longest championship drought in all of major American sport: not winning the World Series since 1908. However, this ended in 2016 when the Cubs finally won their first world series in 108 years.[149][150] That drought finally came to an end when the Cubs beat the Cleveland Indians in seven games to win the 2016 World Series. The Chicago White Sox of the American League won the World Series in 2005, their first since 1917. They play on the city's south side at Guaranteed Rate Field. The Chicago Bears football team has won nine total NFL Championships, the last occurring in Super Bowl XX on January 26, 1986. The Chicago Bulls of the NBA is one of the most recognized basketball teams in the world, largely as a result of the efforts of Michael Jordan, who led the team to six NBA championships in eight seasons in the 1990s. The Chicago Blackhawks of the NHL began playing in 1926, and became a member of the Original Six once the NHL dropped to that number of teams during World War II. The Blackhawks have won six Stanley Cups, most recently in 2015. The Chicago Fire F.C. is a member of MLS and has been one of the league's most successful and best-supported clubs since its founding in 1997, winning one league and four Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cups in that timespan. The team played in Bridgeview, adjacent to Chicago from 2006 to 2019. The team now plays at Soldier Field in Chicago. Other top-level professional sports The Chicago Red Stars have played at the top level of U.S. women's soccer since their formation in 2009, except in the 2011 season.

The Illinois state parks system began in 1908 with what is now Fort Massac State Park, becoming the first park in a system encompassing more than 60 parks and about the same number of recreational and wildlife areas. Areas under the protection of the National Park Service include: the Illinois and Michigan Canal National Heritage Corridor near Lockport,[152] the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail, the Lincoln Home National Historic Site in Springfield, the Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail, the Trail of Tears National Historic Trail, the American Discovery Trail,[153] and the Pullman National Monument. The federal government also manages the Shawnee National Forest and the Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie. Law and politics Main articles: Law of Illinois and Politics of Illinois The Illinois State Capitol in Springfield Illinois House of Representatives State government Main article: Government of Illinois The government of Illinois, under the Constitution of Illinois, has three branches of government: executive, legislative and judicial. The executive branch is split into several statewide elected offices, with the governor as chief executive. Legislative functions are granted to the Illinois General Assembly. The judiciary is composed of the Supreme Court and lower courts. The Illinois General Assembly is the state legislature, composed of the 118-member Illinois House of Representatives and the 59-member Illinois Senate. The members of the General Assembly are elected at the beginning of each even-numbered year. The Illinois Compiled Statutes (ILCS) are the codified statutes of a general and permanent nature.[154][155] The executive branch is composed of six elected officers and their offices as well as numerous other departments.[156] The six elected officers are:[156] Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Attorney General, Secretary of State, Comptroller, and Treasurer. The government of Illinois has numerous departments, agencies, boards and commissions, but the so-called code departments provide most of the state's services.[156][157] The Judiciary of Illinois is the unified court system of Illinois. It consists of the Supreme Court, Appellate Court, and Circuit Courts. The Supreme Court oversees the administration of the court system. The administrative divisions of Illinois are counties, townships, precincts, cities, towns, villages, and special-purpose districts.[158] The basic subdivision of Illinois are the 102 counties.[159] Eighty-five of the 102 counties are in turn divided into townships and precincts.[159][160] Municipal governments are the cities, villages, and incorporated towns.[159] Some localities possess home rule, which allows them to govern themselves to a certain extent.[161] Party balance Illinois is a Democratic stronghold.[162] Historically, Illinois was a political swing state, with near-parity existing between the Republican and the Democratic parties. However, in recent elections, the Democratic Party has gained ground, and Illinois has come to be seen as a solid ""blue"" state in presidential campaigns.[163][164] Votes from Chicago and most of Cook County have long been strongly Democratic. However, the ""collar counties"" (the suburbs surrounding Chicago's Cook County, Illinois), can be seen as moderate voting districts.[165][166] College towns like Carbondale, Champaign, and Normal also lean Democratic. Governor J. B. Pritzker (D) Republicans continue to prevail in the rural areas of northern and central Illinois, as well as southern Illinois outside of East St. Louis. From 1920 until 1972, Illinois was carried by the victor of each of these 14 presidential elections.[167] In fact, the state was long seen as a national bellwether,[168] supporting the winner in every election in the 20th century, except for 1916 and 1976. By contrast, Illinois has trended more toward the Democratic party, and has voted for their presidential candidates in the last six elections; in 2000, George W. Bush became the first Republican to win the presidency without carrying either Illinois or Vermont. Local politician and Chicago resident Barack Obama easily won the state's 21 electoral votes in 2008, with 61.9% of the vote. In 2010, incumbent governor Pat Quinn was re-elected with 47% of the vote, while Republican Mark Kirk was elected to the Senate with 48% of the vote. In 2012, President Obama easily carried Illinois again, with 58% to Republican candidate Mitt Romney's 41%. In 2014, Republican Bruce Rauner defeated Governor Quinn 50% to 46% to become Illinois's first Republican governor in 12 years after being sworn in on January 12, 2015, while Democratic senator Dick Durbin was re-elected with 53% of the vote. In 2016, Hillary Clinton carried Illinois with 55% of the vote, and Tammy Duckworth defeated incumbent Mark Kirk 54% to 40%. George W. Bush and Donald Trump are the only Republican presidential candidates to win without carrying either Illinois or Vermont. In 2018, Democrat JB Pritzker defeated the incumbent Bruce Rauner for the governorship with 54% of the vote. History of corruption Main article: Political corruption in Illinois Politics in the state have been infamous for highly visible corruption cases, as well as for crusading reformers, such as governors Adlai Stevenson and James R. Thompson. In 2006, former governor George Ryan was convicted of racketeering and bribery, leading to a six-and-a-half-year prison sentence. In 2008, then-Governor Rod Blagojevich was served with a criminal complaint on corruption charges, stemming from allegations that he conspired to sell the vacated Senate seat left by President Barack Obama to the highest bidder. Subsequently, on December 7, 2011, Rod Blagojevich was sentenced to 14 years in prison for those charges, as well as perjury while testifying during the case, totaling 18 convictions. Blagojevich was impeached and convicted by the legislature, resulting in his removal from office. In the late 20th century, Congressman Dan Rostenkowski was imprisoned for mail fraud; former governor and federal judge Otto Kerner, Jr. was imprisoned for bribery; Secretary of State Paul Powell was investigated and found to have gained great wealth through bribes, and State Auditor of Public Accounts (Comptroller) Orville Hodge was imprisoned for embezzlement. In 1912, William Lorimer, the GOP boss of Chicago, was expelled from the U.S. Senate for bribery and in 1921, Governor Len Small was found to have defrauded the state of a million dollars.[30][54][169] U.S. presidential elections Main article: United States presidential elections in Illinois Illinois has shown a strong presence in presidential elections. Three presidents have claimed Illinois as their political base when running for president: Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, and most recently Barack Obama. Lincoln was born in Kentucky, but he moved to Illinois at age 21. He served in the General Assembly and represented the 7th congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives before his election to the presidency in 1860. Ulysses S. Grant was born in Ohio and had a military career that precluded settling down, but on the eve of the Civil War and approaching middle age, he moved to Illinois and thus utilized the state as his home and political base when running for president. Barack Obama was born in Hawaii and made Illinois his home after graduating from law school, and later represented Illinois in the U.S. Senate. He then became president in 2008, running as a candidate from his Illinois base. Ronald Reagan was born in Illinois, in the city of Tampico, raised in Dixon, Illinois, and educated at Eureka College, outside Peoria. Reagan later moved to California during his young adulthood. He then became an actor, and later became California's Governor before being elected president. Hillary Clinton was born and raised in the suburbs of Chicago and became the first woman to represent a major political party in the general election of the U.S. presidency. Clinton ran from a platform based in New York State. African-American U.S. senators Nine African-Americans have served as members of the United States Senate. Of which three have represented Illinois, the most of any single state: Carol Moseley-Braun,[170] Barack Obama,[171] and Roland Burris, who was appointed to replace Obama after his election to the presidency. Moseley-Braun was the first African-American woman to become a U.S. Senator. Political families Three families from Illinois have played particularly prominent roles in the Democratic Party, gaining both statewide and national fame. Stevenson The Stevenson family, initially rooted in central Illinois and later based in the Chicago metropolitan area, has provided four generations of Illinois officeholders. Adlai Stevenson I (1835–1914) was a Vice President of the United States, as well as a Congressman Lewis Stevenson (1868–1929), son of Adlai, served as Illinois Secretary of State. Adlai Stevenson II (1900–1965), son of Lewis, served as Governor of Illinois and as the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations; he was also the Democratic party's presidential nominee in 1952 and 1956, losing both elections to Dwight Eisenhower. Adlai Stevenson III (1930–), son of Adlai II, served ten years as a United States Senator. Daley The Daley family's powerbase was in Chicago. Richard J. Daley (1902–1976) served as Mayor of Chicago from 1955 to his death. Richard M. Daley (1942–), son of Richard J, was Chicago's longest-serving mayor, in office from 1989 to 2011. William M. Daley (1948–), another son of Richard J, is a former White House Chief of Staff and has served in a variety of appointed positions. Pritzker The Pritzker family is based in Chicago and have played important roles in both the private and the public sectors. Jay Pritzker (1922–1999), co-founder of Hyatt Hotel based in Chicago. Penny Pritzker (born 1959), 38th United States Secretary of Commerce under President Barack Obama. J.B. Pritzker (born 1965), current and 43rd governor of Illinois and co-founder of the Pritzker Group. Education Illinois State Board of education Main article: Illinois State Board of Education The Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE) is autonomous of the governor and the state legislature, and administers public education in the state. Local municipalities and their respective school districts operate individual public schools, but the ISBE audits performance of public schools with the Illinois School Report Card. The ISBE also makes recommendations to state leaders concerning education spending and policies. Primary and secondary schools See also: List of school districts in Illinois and List of high schools in Illinois Education is compulsory for ages 7–17 in Illinois. Schools are commonly, but not exclusively, divided into three tiers of primary and secondary education: elementary school, middle school or junior high school, and high school. District territories are often complex in structure. Many areas in the state are actually located in two school districts—one for high school, the other for elementary and middle schools. And such districts do not necessarily share boundaries. A given high school may have several elementary districts that feed into it, yet some of those feeder districts may themselves feed into multiple high school districts. Colleges and universities For a more comprehensive list, see List of colleges and universities in Illinois. University of Chicago Using the criterion established by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, there are eleven ""National Universities"" in the state. The University of Chicago is continuously ranked as one of the world's top ten universities on various independent university rankings, and its Booth School of Business, along with Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management consistently rank within the top five graduate business schools in the country and top ten globally. The University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign is often ranked among the best engineering schools in the world and in United States. As of 19 August 2010[update], six of these rank in the ""first tier"" among the top 500 National Universities in the nation, as determined by the U.S. News & World Report rankings: the University of Chicago, Northwestern University, the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, Loyola University Chicago, the Illinois Institute of Technology, DePaul University, University of Illinois at Chicago, Illinois State University, Southern Illinois University Carbondale, and Northern Illinois University.[172] Illinois also has more than twenty additional accredited four-year universities, both public and private, and dozens of small liberal arts colleges across the state. Additionally, Illinois supports 49 public community colleges in the Illinois Community College System. School financing Schools in Illinois are funded primarily by property taxes, based on state assessment of property values, rather than direct state contributions. Scholar Tracy Steffes has described Illinois public education as historically “inequitable,” a system where one of “the wealthiest of states” is “the stingiest in its support for education.” There have been several attempts to reform school funding in Illinois. The most notable attempt came in 1973 with the adoption of the Illinois Resource Equalizer Formula, a measure through which it was hoped funding could be collected and distributed to Illinois schools more equitably. However, opposition from affluent Illinois communities who objected to having to pay for the less well-off school districts (many of them Black majority communities, produced by redlining, white flight, and other “soft” segregation methods) resulted in the formula’s abolition in the late 1980s.[173] Infrastructure Transportation University of Illinois Willard Airport See also: List of airports in Illinois, List of Illinois Routes, List of Illinois railroads, and Category:Illinois waterways Because of its central location and its proximity to the Rust Belt and Grain Belt, Illinois is a national crossroads for air, auto, rail, and truck traffic. Airports Inside O'Hare International Airport From 1962 until 1998, Chicago's O'Hare International Airport (ORD) was the busiest airport in the world, measured both in terms of total flights and passengers. While it was surpassed by Atlanta's Hartsfield in 1998 (as Chicago splits its air traffic between O'Hare and Midway airports, while Atlanta uses only one airport), with 59.3 million domestic passengers annually, along with 11.4 million international passengers in 2008,[174] O'Hare consistently remains one of the two or three busiest airports globally, and in some years still ranks number one in total flights. It is a major hub for both United Airlines and American Airlines, and a major airport expansion project is currently underway. Midway Airport (MDW), which had been the busiest airport in the world at one point until it was supplanted by O'Hare as the busiest airport in 1962, is now the secondary airport in the Chicago metropolitan area and still ranks as one of the nation's busiest airports. Midway is a major hub for Southwest Airlines and services many other carriers as well. Midway served 17.3 million domestic and international passengers in 2008.[175] Rail Illinois major rail network Illinois has an extensive passenger and freight rail transportation network. Chicago is a national Amtrak hub and in-state passengers are served by Amtrak's Illinois Service, featuring the Chicago to Carbondale Illini and Saluki, the Chicago to Quincy Carl Sandburg and Illinois Zephyr, and the Chicago to St. Louis Lincoln Service. Currently there is trackwork on the Chicago–St. Louis line to bring the maximum speed up to 110 mph (180 km/h), which would reduce the trip time by an hour and a half. Nearly every North American railway meets at Chicago, making it the largest and most active rail hub in the country. Extensive commuter rail is provided in the city proper and some immediate suburbs by the Chicago Transit Authority's 'L' system. One of the largest suburban commuter rail system in the United States, operated by Metra, uses existing rail lines to provide direct commuter rail access for hundreds of suburbs to the city and beyond. In addition to the state's rail lines, the Mississippi River and Illinois River provide major transportation routes for the state's agricultural interests. Lake Michigan gives Illinois access to the Atlantic Ocean by way of the Saint Lawrence Seaway. Interstate highway system Main article: List of Interstate Highways in Illinois The Interstate Highways in Illinois are all segments of the Interstate Highway System that are owned and maintained by the state.[176] Illinois has the distinction of having the most primary (two-digit) interstates pass through it among all the 50 states with 13. Illinois also ranks third among the fifty states with the most interstate mileage, coming in after California and Texas, which are much bigger states in area.[177] Major U.S. Interstate highways crossing the state include: Interstate 24 (I-24), I-39, I-41, I-55, I-57, I-64, I-70, I-72, I-74, I-80, I-88, I-90, and I-94. U.S. highway system Main article: List of U.S. Highways in Illinois The Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) is responsible for maintaining the U.S Highways in Illinois. The system in Illinois consists of 21 primary highways. Among the U.S. highways that pass through the state, the primary ones are: US 6, US 12, US 14, US 20, US 24, US 30, US 34, US 36, US 40, US 41, US 45, US 50, US 51, US 52, US 54, US 60, US 62, and US 67.

We proclaim Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior. In our preaching and teaching the ELCA trusts the Gospel as the power of God for the salvation of all who believe. ELCA teaching or theology serves the proclamation and ministry of this faith. It does not have an answer for all questions, not even all religious questions. Teaching or theology prepares members to be witnesses in speech and in action of God’s rich mercy in Jesus Christ. Scriptures, Creeds and Confessions The ELCA’s official Confession of Faith identifies the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments (commonly called the Bible); the Apostles’, Nicene and Athanasian Creeds; and the Lutheran confessional writings in the Book of Concord as the basis for our teaching. ELCA congregations make the same affirmation in their governing documents, and ELCA pastors and deacons promise to carry out their ministry in accordance with these teaching sources. This Confession of Faith is more than just words in an official document. Every Sunday in worship ELCA congregations hear God’s word from the Scriptures, pray as Jesus taught and come to the Lord’s Table expecting to receive the mercies that the Triune God promises. Throughout the week ELCA members continue to live by faith, serving others freely and generously in all that they do because they trust God’s promise in the Gospel. In small groups and at sick beds, in private devotions and in daily work, this faith saturates all of life. Teaching for a life of faith This connection to all of life is the clearest demonstration of the authority that the canonical Scriptures, the ecumenical Creeds and the Lutheran Confessions have in the ELCA. The Holy Spirit uses these witnesses to create, strengthen and sustain faith in Jesus Christ and the life we have in him. That life-giving work continues every day, as Martin Luther explained in the Small Catechism: the Holy Spirit “calls, gathers, enlightens and sanctifies the whole Christian church on earth and preserves it in union with Jesus Christ in the one true faith.” Resources View Faith and Society Resources ELCA TeachingScriptures, Creeds, ConfessionsTheological ConversationsLuther and LutheranismEcumenical and Inter-Religious RelationsJournal of Lutheran EthicsDaily Bible ReadingFaith and Society This is Christ's church.

The ELCA was constituted in 1987 and began operation in 1988, as a result of the union of the American Lutheran Church (ALC), the Lutheran Church in America (LCA) and the Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches (AELC). The ELCA traces its history through predecessor church bodies to the formation in 1748 of the first synod in North America, the Ministerium of Pennsylvania. Two of the uniting churches that formed the ELCA were the result of mergers. The ALC was formed in 1960, bringing together four churches of German, Norwegian, and Danish heritage. Subsequently, in 1962, the LCA was established in a four-way merger of German, Danish, Finnish, and Swedish heritage churches. Those mergers of the early 1960s marked a movement away from ethnic identity for US Lutheran church bodies. By contrast to mergers, the AELC resulted from a break in 1976 from The Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod in a dispute over the authority and interpretation of scripture. The ELCA represents historical continuity for Lutherans from colonial days as well as the weaving together into one body all of the threads of Lutheran history in North America. Efforts to form the ELCA formally began in 1982 when the three uniting churches elected a 70-member commission to draft the constitution and other agreements. In August 1986, the conventions of the three churches approved the merger. That action led to the ELCA's constituting assembly in May 1987. Its congregations are grouped into 65 synods throughout the US and the Caribbean region, each led by a bishop elected by voting members at a synod assembly to six-year, renewable terms. The highest governing authority in the ELCA is the churchwide assembly, which includes 600 lay voting members equally divided by gender and about 400 clergy voting members. A 37-member church council, elected by the assembly, serves as the board of directors and interim legislative authority between assemblies. The presiding bishop is the ELCA's chief pastor and the executive officer of the churchwide organization. Both the presiding bishop and secretary are elected by the churchwide assembly. Their terms of office are six years and incumbents are eligible for re-election. A lay vice president, who is elected to the volunteer position by the churchwide assembly, chairs the church council. Units within the churchwide organization include: congregational ministries, rostered ministries, outreach, higher education and schools, church in society, and global mission. Ecumenical relations are coordinated through the office of the presiding bishop and include ecumenical, inter-Lutheran, and inter-religious activities. The publishing unit, located in Minneapolis, is known as Augsburg Fortress, Publishers. A formal relationship of full communion was established in 1997 between the ELCA and the Presbyterian Church (USA), Reformed Church in America, and the United Church of Christ. In 1999, relationships of full communion were formed with the Episcopal Church USA, and with the Moravian Church. As a member of the Lutheran World Federation, the ELCA affirmed in 1999 the ""Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification"" with the Roman Catholic Church.

With more than 17.9 million inhabitants, it is the most populous state of Germany. Covering an area of 34,084 square kilometres (13,160 sq mi), it is the fourth-largest German state by size. Apart from the city-states, it is also the most densely populated state in Germany. North Rhine-Westphalia features 30 of the 81 German municipalities with over 100,000 inhabitants, including Cologne (over 1 million), the state capital Düsseldorf, Dortmund and Essen (all about 600,000 inhabitants) and other cities predominantly located in the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan area, the largest urban area in Germany and the third-largest on the European continent. The location of the Rhine-Ruhr at the heart of the European Blue Banana makes it well connected to other major European cities and metropolitan areas like the Randstad, the Flemish Diamond and the Frankfurt Rhine-Main Region. North Rhine-Westphalia was established in 1946 after World War II from the Prussian provinces of Westphalia and the northern part of Rhine Province (North Rhine), and the Free State of Lippe by the British military administration in Allied-occupied Germany and became a state of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1949. The city of Bonn served as the federal capital until the reunification of Germany in 1990 and as the seat of government until 1999. Culturally, North Rhine-Westphalia is not a uniform area; there are significant differences, especially in traditional customs, between the Rhineland region on the one hand and the regions of Westphalia and Lippe on the other. The state has always been Germany's powerhouse with the largest economy among the German states by GDP figures.

Rhineland[edit] Main article: Rhineland The first written account of the area was by its conqueror, Julius Caesar, the territories west of the Rhine were occupied by the Eburones and east of the Rhine he reported the Ubii (across from Cologne) and the Sugambri to their north. The Ubii and some other Germanic tribes such as the Cugerni were later settled on the west side of the Rhine in the Roman province of Germania Inferior. Julius Caesar conquered the tribes on the left bank, and Augustus established numerous fortified posts on the Rhine, but the Romans never succeeded in gaining a firm footing on the right bank, where the Sugambri neighboured several other tribes including the Tencteri and Usipetes. North of the Sigambri and the Rhine region were the Bructeri. As the power of the Roman empire declined, many of these tribes came to be seen collectively as Ripuarian Franks and they pushed forward along both banks of the Rhine, and by the end of the fifth century had conquered all the lands that had formerly been under Roman influence. By the eighth century, the Frankish dominion was firmly established in western Germany and northern Gaul, but at the same time, to the north, Westphalia was being taken over by Saxons pushing south. The Merovingian and Carolingian Franks eventually built an empire which controlled first their Ripuarian kin, and then the Saxons. On the division of the Carolingian Empire at the Treaty of Verdun, the part of the province to the east of the river fell to East Francia, while that to the west remained with the kingdom of Lotharingia.[5] By the time of Otto I (d. 973), both banks of the Rhine had become part of the Holy Roman Empire, and the Rhenish territory was divided between the duchies of Upper Lorraine on the Moselle and Lower Lorraine on the Meuse. The Ottonian dynasty had both Saxon and Frankish ancestry. Map of the Lower Rhenish–Westphalian Circle in 1799 by John Cary As the central power of the Holy Roman Emperor weakened, the Rhineland split into numerous small, independent, separate vicissitudes and special chronicles. The old Lotharingian divisions became obsolete, although the name survives for example in Lorraine in France, and throughout the Middle Ages and even into modern times, the nobility of these areas often sought to preserve the idea of a preeminent duke within Lotharingia, something claimed by the Dukes of Limburg, and the Dukes of Brabant. Such struggles as the War of the Limburg Succession therefore continued to create military and political links between what is now Rhineland-Westphalia and neighbouring Belgium and the Netherlands. In spite of its dismembered condition and the sufferings it underwent at the hands of its French neighbours in various periods of warfare, the Rhenish territory prospered greatly and stood in the foremost rank of German culture and progress. Aachen was the place of coronation of the German emperors, and the ecclesiastical principalities of the Rhine bulked largely in German history.[5] Prussia first set foot on the Rhine in 1609 by the occupation of the Duchy of Cleves and about a century later Upper Guelders and Moers also became Prussian. At the peace of Basel in 1795, the whole of the left bank of the Rhine was resigned to France, and in 1806, the Rhenish princes all joined the Confederation of the Rhine. After the Congress of Vienna, Prussia was awarded the entire Rhineland, which included the Grand Duchy of Berg, the ecclesiastic electorates of Trier and Cologne, the free cities of Aachen and Cologne, and nearly a hundred small lordships and abbeys. The Prussian Rhine province was formed in 1822 and Prussia had the tact to leave them in undisturbed possession of the liberal institutions to which they had become accustomed under the republican rule of the French.[5] In 1920, the districts of Eupen and Malmedy were transferred to Belgium (see German-speaking Community of Belgium). Westphalia[edit] Main article: Westphalia Around AD 1, numerous incursions occurred through Westphalia and perhaps even some permanent Roman or Romanized settlements. The Battle of Teutoburg Forest took place near Osnabrück and some of the Germanic tribes who fought at this battle came from the area of Westphalia. Charlemagne is thought to have spent considerable time in Paderborn and nearby parts. His Saxon Wars also partly took place in what is thought of as Westphalia today. Popular legends link his adversary Widukind to places near Detmold, Bielefeld, Lemgo, Osnabrück, and other places in Westphalia. Widukind was buried in Enger, which is also a subject of a legend. Along with Eastphalia and Engern, Westphalia (Westfalahi) was originally a district of the Duchy of Saxony. In 1180, Westphalia was elevated to the rank of a duchy by Emperor Barbarossa. The Duchy of Westphalia comprised only a small area south of the Lippe River. Ratification of the Peace of Westphalia of 1648 in Münster by Gerard Terborch Parts of Westphalia came under Brandenburg-Prussian control during the 17th and 18th centuries, but most of it remained divided duchies and other feudal areas of power. The Peace of Westphalia of 1648, signed in Münster and Osnabrück, ended the Thirty Years' War. The concept of nation-state sovereignty resulting from the treaty became known as ""Westphalian sovereignty"". As a result of the Protestant Reformation, there is no dominant religion in Westphalia. Catholicism and Lutheranism are on relatively equal footing. Lutheranism is strong in the eastern and northern parts with numerous free churches. Münster and especially Paderborn are thought of as Catholic. Osnabrück is divided almost equally between Catholicism and Protestantism. After the defeat of the Prussian Army at the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt, the Treaty of Tilsit in 1807 made the Westphalian territories part of the Kingdom of Westphalia from 1807 to 1813. It was founded by Napoleon and was a French vassal state. This state only shared the name with the historical region; it contained only a relatively small part of Westphalia, consisting instead mostly of Hessian and Eastphalian regions. After the Congress of Vienna, the Kingdom of Prussia received a large amount of territory in the Westphalian region and created the province of Westphalia in 1815. The northernmost portions of the former kingdom, including the town of Osnabrück, had become part of the states of Hanover and Oldenburg. Flags and coat of arms[edit] The flag of North Rhine-Westphalia is green-white-red with the combined coats of arms of the Rhineland (white line before green background, symbolizing the river Rhine), Westfalen (the white horse) and Lippe (the red rose). After the establishment of North Rhine-Westphalia in 1946, the tricolor was first introduced in 1948, but was not formally adopted until 1953.[6] The plain variant of the tricolor is considered the civil flag and state ensign, while government authorities use the state flag (Landesdienstflagge) which is defaced with the state's coat of arms.[6] The state ensign can easily be mistaken for a distressed flag of Hungary, as well as the former national flag of Iran (1964–1980). The same flag was used by the Rhenish Republic (1923–1924) as a symbol of independence and freedom. According to legend, the horse in the Westphalian coat of arms is the horse that the Saxon leader Widukind rode after his baptism. Other theories attribute the horse to Henry the Lion. Some connect it with the Germanic rulers Hengist and Horsa.[citation needed] Geography[edit] Geographic map of North Rhine-Westphalia North Rhine-Westphalia encompasses the plains of the Lower Rhine region and parts of the Central Uplands (die Mittelgebirge) up to the gorge of Porta Westfalica. The state covers an area of 34,083 km2 (13,160 sq mi) and shares borders with Belgium (Wallonia) in the southwest and the Netherlands (Limburg, Gelderland and Overijssel) in the west and northwest. It has borders with the German states of Lower Saxony to the north and northeast, Rhineland-Palatinate to the south and Hesse to the southeast. Approximately half of the state is located in the relative low-lying terrain of the Westphalian Lowland and the Rhineland, both extending broadly into the North German Plain. A few isolated hill ranges are located within these lowlands, among them the Hohe Mark, the Beckum Hills, the Baumberge and the Stemmer Berge. The terrain rises towards the south and in the east of the state into parts of Germany's Central Uplands. These hill ranges are the Weser Uplands – including the Egge Hills, the Wiehen Hills, the Wesergebirge and the Teutoburg Forest in the east, the Sauerland, the Bergisches Land, the Siegerland and the Siebengebirge in the south, as well as the left-Rhenish Eifel in the southwest of the state. The Rothaargebirge in the border region with Hesse rises to height of about 800 m above sea level. The highest of these mountains are the Langenberg, at 843.2 m above sea level, the Kahler Asten (840.7 m) and the Clemensberg (839.2 m). The planimetrically-determined centre of North Rhine-Westphalia is located in the south of Dortmund-Aplerbeck in the Aplerbecker Mark (51° 28' N, 7° 33' Ö). Its westernmost point is situated near Selfkant close to the Dutch border, the easternmost near Höxter on the Weser. The southernmost point lies near Hellenthal in the Eifel region. The northernmost point is the NRW-Nordpunkt near Rahden in the northeast of the state. The Nordpunkt has located the only 100  km to the south of the North Sea coast. The deepest natural dip is arranged in the district Zyfflich in the city of Kranenburg with 9.2 m above sea level in the northwest of the state. Though, the deepest point overground results from mining. The open-pit Hambach reaches at Niederzier a deep of 293 m below sea level. At the same time, this is the deepest man-made dip in Germany. The most important rivers flowing at least partially through North Rhine-Westphalia include: the Rhine, the Ruhr, the Ems, the Lippe, and the Weser. The Rhine is by far the most important river in North Rhine-Westphalia: it enters the state as Middle Rhine near Bad Honnef, where still being part of the Mittelrhein wine region. It changes into the Lower Rhine near Bad Godesberg and leaves North Rhine-Westphalia near Emmerich at a width of 730 metres. Almost immediately after entering the Netherlands, the Rhine splits into many branches. The Pader, which flows entirely within the city of Paderborn, is considered Germany's shortest river. For many, North Rhine-Westphalia is synonymous with industrial areas and urban agglomerations. However, the largest part of the state is used for agriculture (almost 52%) and forests (25%).[7] Subdivisions[edit] See also: List of places in North Rhine-Westphalia The state consists of five government regions (Regierungsbezirke), divided into 31 districts (Kreise) and 23 urban districts (kreisfreie Städte). In total, North Rhine-Westphalia has 396 municipalities (1997), including the urban districts, which are municipalities by themselves. The government regions have an assembly elected by the districts and municipalities, while the Landschaftsverband has a directly elected assembly. The five government regions of North Rhine-Westphalia each belong to one of the two Landschaftsverbände: Landschaftsverband Rhineland Landschaftsverband Westfalen-Lippe The regional authorities Rhineland (green) and Westphalia-Lippe (red) Government districts (Regierungsbezirke) historical regions Government districts (Regierungsbezirke) historical regions Düsseldorf Rhineland Bergisches Land Eifel Aachen Lower Rhine Rheinschiene Cologne/Bonn Arnsberg Westphalia Münsterland Minden-Ravensberg Prince-Bishopric Paderborn Sauerland Siegerland Tecklenburger Land Lippe Lipper Land, the region of the ancient free state Köln Detmold Münster Rural Districts (Kreise) Urban Districts (Kreisfreie Städte) Aachen Städteregion Borken Coesfeld Düren Ennepe-Ruhr-Kreis Rhein-Erft-Kreis Euskirchen Gütersloh Heinsberg Herford Hochsauerlandkreis Höxter Kleve Lippe Märkischer Kreis Mettmann Minden-Lübbecke Rhein-Kreis Neuss Oberbergischer Kreis Olpe Paderborn Recklinghausen Rheinisch-Bergischer Kreis Rhein-Sieg-Kreis Siegen-Wittgenstein Soest Steinfurt Unna Viersen Warendorf Wesel Aachen Bielefeld Bochum Bonn Bottrop Dortmund Duisburg Düsseldorf Essen Gelsenkirchen Hagen Hamm Herne Cologne / Köln Krefeld Leverkusen Mönchengladbach Mülheim Münster Oberhausen Remscheid Solingen Wuppertal Borders[edit] The state's area covers a maximum distance of 291 km from north to south, and 266 km from east to west. The total length of the state's borders is 1,645 km. The following countries and states have a border with North Rhine-Westphalia:[8] Belgium (99 km) Netherlands (387 km) Lower Saxony (583 km) Hesse (269 km) Rhineland-Palatinate (307 km) Demographics[edit] See also: List of cities in North Rhine-Westphalia by population Cologne Düsseldorf North Rhine-Westphalia has a population of approximately 17.5 million inhabitants (more than the entire former East Germany, and slightly more than the Netherlands) and is centred around the polycentric Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region, which includes the industrial Ruhr region with the largest city of Dortmund and the Rhenish cities of Bonn, Cologne and Düsseldorf. 30 of the 80 largest cities in Germany are located within North Rhine-Westphalia. The state's capital is Düsseldorf; the state's largest city is Cologne. In 2015, there were 160,478 births and 204,373 deaths. The TRF reached 1.52 (2015) and was highest in Lippe (1.72) and lowest in Bochum (1.29).

In 2016, the interior ministry of North Rhine-Westphalia reported that the number of mosques with a salafist influence had risen from 3 to 9, which indicated both an actual increase and improved reporting.[13] According to German authorities, Salafism is incompatible with the principles codified in the Constitution of Germany, in particular, democracy, the rule of law and a political order based on human rights.[14] Politics[edit] Main article: Politics of North Rhine-Westphalia Landtag in Düsseldorf The politics of North Rhine-Westphalia takes place within a framework of a federal parliamentary representative democratic republic. The two main parties are, as on the federal level, the centre-right Christian Democratic Union and the centre-left Social Democratic Party. From 1966 to 2005, North Rhine-Westphalia was continuously governed by the Social Democrats or SPD-led governments. The state's legislative body is the Landtag (""state diet"").[15] It may pass laws within the competency of the state, e.g. cultural matters, the education system, matters of internal security, i.e. the police, building supervision, health supervision and the media; as opposed to matters that are reserved to Federal law.[15] North Rhine-Westphalia uses the same electoral system as the Federal level in Germany: ""Personalized proportional representation"". Every five years the citizens of North Rhine-Westphalia vote in a general election to elect at least 181 members of the Landtag. Only parties who win at least 5% of the votes cast may be represented in parliament.[15] The Landtag, the parliamentary parties and groups consisting of at least 7 members of parliament have the right to table legal proposals to the Landtag for deliberation.[15] The law that is passed by the Landtag is delivered to the Minister-President, who, together with the ministers involved, is required to sign it and announce it in the Law and Ordinance Gazette.[15] List of Ministers-President[edit] These are the Ministers-president of the Federal State of North-Rhine Westphalia: Ministers-president of North Rhine-Westphalia No. Name Image Born-Died Party affiliation Start of Tenure End of Tenure 1 Rudolf Amelunxen 1888–1969 Centre Party 1946 1947 2 Karl Arnold 1901–1958 CDU 1947 1956 3 Fritz Steinhoff 1897–1969 SPD 1956 1958 4 Franz Meyers 1908–2002 CDU 1958 1966 5 Heinz Kühn 1912–1992 SPD 1966 1978 6 Johannes Rau 1931–2006 SPD 1978 1998 7 Wolfgang Clement 1940–2020 SPD 1998 2002 8 Peer Steinbrück *1947 SPD 2002 2005 9 Jürgen Rüttgers *1951 CDU 2005 2010 10 Hannelore Kraft *1961 SPD 2010 2017 11 Armin Laschet *1961 CDU 2017 incumbent For the current state government, see Cabinet Laschet.

North Rhine-Westphalia is home to many of Germany's best-known heavy metal, speed metal and thrash metal bands: Accept, Angel Dust, Blind Guardian, Doro (formerly of Warlock), Grave Digger, Holy Moses, Kreator, Rage, Scanner and Sodom. Also, North Rhine-Westphalia is home to Kraftwerk, originally a Krautrock band for four years, then later a synth-pop band. Economy[edit] Main article: Economy of North Rhine-Westphalia ThyssenKrupp headquarters in Essen North Rhine-Westphalia has always been Germany's powerhouse with the largest economy among the German states by GDP figures.[20] In the 1950s and 1960s, Westphalia was known as Land von Kohle und Stahl (Land of Coal and Steel). In the post-World War II recovery, the Ruhr was one of the most important industrial regions in Europe, and contributed to the German Wirtschaftswunder. As of the late 1960s, repeated crises led to contractions of these industrial branches. On the other hand, producing sectors, particularly in mechanical engineering and metal and iron working industry, experienced substantial growth. Despite this structural change and an economic growth which was under national average, the 2018 GDP of 705 billion euro (1/4 of the total German GDP) made NRW the economically strongest state of Germany by GRP figures, as well as one of the most important economical areas in the world.[21] Of Germany's top 100 corporations, 37 are based in North Rhine-Westphalia. On a per capita base, however, North Rhine-Westphalia remains one of the weaker among the Western German states.[22] North Rhine-Westphalia attracts companies from both Germany and abroad. In 2009, the state had the most foreign direct investments (FDI) anywhere in Germany.[23] Around 13,100 foreign companies from the most important investment countries control their German or European operations from bases in North Rhine-Westphalia.[citation needed] There have been many changes in the state's economy in recent times. Among the many changes in the economy, employment in the creative industries is up while the mining sector is employing fewer people.[16] Industrial heritage sites are now workplaces for designers, artists and the advertising industry.[16][24] The Ruhr region has – since the 1960s – undergone a significant structural change away from coal mining and steel industry. Many rural parts of Eastern Westphalia, Bergisches Land and the Lower Rhine ground their economy on ""Hidden Champions"" in various sectors. As of June 2014, the unemployment rate is 8.2%, second highest among all western German states.[25] In October 2018 the unemployment rate stood at 6.4% and was higher than the national average.[26] Year[27] 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Unemployment rate in % 9.2 8.8 9.2 10.0 10.2 12.0 11.4 9.5 8.5 8.9 8.7 8.1 8.1 8.3 8.2 8.0 7.7 7.4 6.8 Transport[edit] With its central location in the most important European economic area, high population density, strong urbanization and numerous business locations, North Rhine-Westphalia has one of the densest transport networks in the world. Regional rail network[edit] Transportsystem Rhein-Ruhr in 2014 Stadtbahn in Dortmund The regional rail network is organised around the main in towns in Rhein-Ruhr: Bonn, Cologne, Wuppertal, Düsseldorf, Essen and Dortmund. Some public transport companies in this region are run under the umbrella of the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr, which provides a uniform ticket system valid for the entire area. The Ruhr region is well-integrated into the national rail system, the Deutsche Bahn, for both passenger and goods services, each city in the region has at least one or more train stations. The bigger central stations have hourly direct connections to the bigger European cities as Amsterdam, Brussels, Paris, Vienna or Zürich. The Rhein-Ruhr area also contains the longest tram system in the world, with tram and Stadtbahn services from Witten to Krefeld as well as the Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn network. Originally the system was even bigger, it was possible to travel from Unna to Bad Honnef without using railway or bus services. As of 2012[update], the VRR network consists of 978 lines,[28] of which there are: in regional rail transit 11 S-Bahn lines[28] (see: Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn) 15 RegionalExpress lines[28] (see: List of regional railway lines in North Rhine-Westphalia) 24 RegionalBahn lines[28] (see: List of regional railway lines in North Rhine-Westphalia) in local rail transit 19 Stadtbahn light rail lines[28] (see: Rhine-Ruhr Stadtbahn) 45 streetcar (Straßenbahn) lines[28] 1 Schwebebahn line[28] (in Wuppertal) 2 H-Bahn peoplemover systems[28] made up of three lines (two H-Bahn lines in Dortmund, and the Düsseldorf SkyTrain at Düsseldorf airport) in bus transit 906 bus lines,[28] including 33 express bus lines (Schnellbus, SB) 18 semi-fast bus lines (CityExpress, CE) 6 trolleybus lines[28] (in Solingen) 15,300 km of route network[29] (bus, light rail, and train) 11,500 transit stops Road[edit] Autobahn A40 in Essen North Rhine-Westphalia has the densest network of Autobahns in Germany and similar Schnellstraßen (expressways). The Autobahn network is built in a grid network, with five east–west (A2, A4, A40, A42, A44) and eight north–south (A1, A3, A43, A45, A52, A57, A59, A61) routes. The A1, A2, A3, A4 and A61 are mostly used by through traffic, while the other autobahns have a more regional function. Both the A44 and the A52 have several missing links, in various stages of planning. Some missing sections are currently in construction or planned to be constructed in the near future. Additional expressways serve as bypasses and local routes, especially around Dortmund and Bochum. Due to the density of the autobahns and expressways, Bundesstraßen are less important for intercity traffic. The first Autobahns in the Region opened during the mid-1930s. Due to the density of the network, and the number of alternative routes, traffic volumes are generally lower than other major metropolitan areas in Europe. Traffic congestion is an everyday occurrence, but far less so than in the Randstad in the Netherlands, another polycentric urban area. Most important Autobahns have six lanes. Airports[edit] Airport in front of Cologne's skyline The region benefits from the presence of several airport infrastructure. The main airport is Düsseldorf Airport, world class, which hosts 24.5 million passengers per year and offers flights to many destinations.Düsseldorf is the third largest airport in Germany after Frankfurt and Munich;[30] It is a hub for Eurowings and a focus city for several more airlines. The airport has three passenger terminals and two runways and can handle wide-body aircraft up to the Airbus A380.[31] The second airport is the international airport of Germany's fourth-largest city Cologne, and also serves Bonn, former capital of West Germany. With around 12.4 million passengers passing through it in 2017, it is the seventh-largest passenger airport in Germany and the third-largest in terms of cargo operations.

It is not the most beautiful Campus Bit very acceptable. Very complicated process but great professors Anonymous rated 4 out of 5 stars My study experience was great in terms of the course components. The disadvantages for me is that the students are overloaded with theoretical information. Also the student website is not very straight forward, this could confuse a lot of students.

Münster, located in the northern part of the German state of Nordrhein Westfalen, is the cultural capital of Westfalen. With nearly 273,000 inhabitants, Münster offers the conveniences of a large city while having the character of a small town. Founded in 793 by St. Liudger, Münster was the seat of one of the most important ecclesiastical states of the Holy Roman Empire for over 1000 years. Münster has played a central role in European history since its founding. It was an important member of the Hanseatic League, and it is still an important trading city. UNO ISEP Exchange Regular International Exchange students can go for one semester or for a full academic year. The exchange agreement between UNO and Fh-Münster allows students to pay tuition at their home institution but they must pay all other expenses, such as housing, transportation, insurance, meals, etc.UNO students at the Fh-Münster must pay a ""Semester Fee"" for every semester they are at Fh-Münster. The Semester Fee pays for a variety of services for students, including Internet access and a rail pass good for local trains and public transportation in the German state of Nordrhein-Westfalen. Please keep in mind that the German academic calendar does not coincide with that of UNO, so those students wishing to study abroad for only one semester may find it beneficial to attend the ""summer"" semester in Germany. The winter semester starts October 1 and finishes at the end of February with a break for Christmas. The summer semester starts April 1 and ends the beginning of July. Courses While Fh-Münster offers courses in English, mostly in business, fluency in German will increase the availability of courses. Without enough language skills students will be restricted to classes within special programs, or to a small number of courses offered in English.

107,"Product certification - Wikipedia Product certification From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search The examples and perspective in this article deal primarily with the United States and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject. You may improve this article, discuss the issue on the talk page, or create a new article, as appropriate. (August 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) product certifications (many nations) Product certification or product qualification is the process of certifying that a certain product has passed performance tests and quality assurance tests, and meets qualification criteria stipulated in contracts, regulations, or specifications (sometimes called ""certification schemes"" in the product certification industry). Most product certification bodies (or product certifiers) are accredited to or aligned with ISO/IEC 17065 Conformity assessment -- Requirements for bodies certifying products, processes and services (previously ISO/IEC Guide 65:1996)[1] an international standard for ensuring competence in those organizations performing product, process and service certifications. The organizations that perform this accreditation are called Accreditation Bodies, and they themselves are assessed by international peers against the ISO 17011 standard. In India Product certification is being monitored by BUREAU OF INDIAN STANDARDS.[2] Examples of some certification schemes include the Safety Equipment Institute for protective headgear, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Telecommunication Certification Body (TCB) program for radio communication devices, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Energy Star program, the International Commission on the Rules for the Approval of Electrical Equipment Product Safety Certification Body Scheme (IEECE CB Scheme), MAS (Materials Analytical Services) Certified Green IEQ program, and the Greenguard Environmental Institute Indoor Air Quality program. Certification schemes are typically written to include both the performance test methods that the product must be tested to, as well as the criteria that the product must meet to become Certified.[3] Certifications (and the certificates that document their existence) are often called ""certs"" in the everyday jargon of various industries. Contents 1 Certification process 2 Certification marks and listings of certified products 3 Accreditation bodies 4 European Economic Area 5 International applications 6 See also 7 References 8 External links Certification process[edit] A product might be verified to comply with a specification or stamped with a specification number. This does not, by itself, indicate that the item is fit for any particular use. The person or group of persons who own the certification scheme (i.e., engineers, trade unions, building code writers, government, industry, etc.) have the responsibility to consider the choice of available specifications, choose the correct ones, set qualification limits, and enforce compliance with those limits. The end users of the product have the responsibility to use the item correctly. Products must be used in accordance with their listing for certification to be effective. Product certification is often required in sensitive industry and marketplace areas where a failure could have serious consequences, such as negatively affecting the health and welfare of the people or person using that product. For example, certification is stringent in aerospace applications, since the demands for low weight tend to lead to high stress on components, requiring appropriate metallurgy and accuracy in manufacturing. Other sensitive product area examples include food, pharmaceuticals, healthcare products, dangerous goods, electrical equipments and products that have RF emissions such as computers and cellular telephones. The process for certification of a product is generally summed up in four steps: Application (including testing of the product) Evaluation (does the test data indicate that the product meets qualification criteria) Decision (does a second review of the product application concur with the Evaluation) Surveillance (does the product in the marketplace continue to meet qualification criteria) In many instances, prior to applying for certification, a product supplier will send a product to a testing laboratory (some certification schemes require the product to be sent out for testing by the product certifier instead). When the product to be certified is received at the testing laboratory, it is tested in accordance with the laboratory's internal procedures and with the methods listed in the test standards specified by the certification scheme. The resulting data collected by the testing laboratory, and is then forwarded either back to the manufacturer, or directly to the product certifier. The product certifier then reviews the product supplier's application information, including the testing data.[1] If the certifier's evaluation[1] concludes that the test data shows that the product meets all required criteria as listed in the certification scheme, and the decision maker(s) of the product certifier concur with the evaluation,[1] then the product is deemed ""certified"" and is listed in a directory that the Product certifier is required to keep.[1] ISO Guide 65 requires[1] that the final decision to grant or not grant certification be made only by a person or group of persons not involved in the evaluation of the product. Products often need periodic recertification, also known as surveillance. This requirement is typically identified within the certification scheme that the product is certified to. Certification bodies may require product suppliers to perform some sort of surveillance activity,[1] such as pulling sample products from the marketplace for testing,[4][5] in order to maintain their ""listed"" or ""certified"" status. Other examples of Surveillance activities include surprise audits of the manufacturing plant, supervision of the manufacturing and/or testing process,[6] or a simple paperwork submittal from the supplier to the product certifier to ensure that the certified product has not changed. Other causes for recertification may include complaints issued against the product's functionality, which would require removal from the marketplace, and expiration of the original certification. These lists of examples are by no means all inclusive. Some certification schemes, or the product certifiers that operate those Schemes, may require that the product supplier operate a Quality Management System registered to ISO 9000, or that the testing be performed by a laboratory accredited to ISO 17025.[7] The decision to set these requirements is most often made by the person or group which owns the Certification Scheme. Certification marks and listings of certified products[edit] Main articles: Certification mark and certification listing Certified products are typically endorsed with a certification mark provided by the product certifier. Issuance of a certification mark is at the discretion of the individual product certifier. ISO Guide 65 does not require the product certifier to offer a certification mark in the event that a certificate is offered. When certification marks are issued and used on products, they are usually easy to see and enable users to track down the certification listings to determine the criteria that the product meets, and whether or not the listing is still active. An active certification listing must minimally include indication of[1] the following information: The specific product or type of product certified The qualification standard that the product is judged to meet The date of certification (and if applicable, its expiration) Product certifiers may choose to include much more information than that listed above, but ISO Guide 65 specifies the bare minimum which must be made available regarding the certification status of a product. These listings are typically used by an Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ), such as a municipal building inspector, fire prevention officer, or electrical inspector, to compare the product's use or installation with the intent of the rating by testing. In order to comply with the code, the product listing must be ""active"", as products and companies can become ""de-listed"" due to re-testing showing that a product no longer meets qualification criteria, or a business decision by the manufacturer. The widespread availability of the Internet has led to a new kind of certification for websites. Website certifications exist to certify the website's privacy policy, security of their financial transactions, suitability for minors, among many other acceptability characteristics. In broadcast engineering, transmitters and radio antennas often must by certified by the country's broadcasting authority. In the United States, this certification was once called ""type acceptance"" by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and applied to most services except amateur radio due to its inherent homebrew nature. Today the FCC requires[5] all testing of transmitters and antennas to be performed in a laboratory accredited to ISO 17025, with that laboratory being part of the overall organization that houses the Product Certification Body (TCB). Accreditation bodies[edit] The International Accreditation Forum (IAF) has a listing of all recognized Accreditation Bodies whose accreditations to the ISO Guide 65 standard are deemed equivalent. From the IAF MLA informational page:[8] ""IAF is encouraging more of its members to join the MLA as soon as they have passed a rigorous evaluation process to ensure that their accreditation programs are of world standard. The consequence of joining the IAF MLA is that conformity assessment certificates issued, within the scope of the IAF MLA, by conformity assessment bodies accredited by any one of the members of the IAF MLA will be recognised in the world wide IAF program."" Most countries only have a single Accreditation Body representing their economy in the IAF MLA. The two exceptions are the United States with American National Standards Institute (ANSI), American National Standards Institute - American Society for Quality National Accreditation Board (ANAB, a subdivision of ANSI), American Association for Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA), and International Accreditation Service (IAS) as signatory members, and United Accreditation Foundation as Full Member of IAF (International Accreditation Forum) Europe with Germany's Technischer Überwachungsverein (TÜV), and Korea which is represented by Korea Accreditation Board (KAB) and Korean Accreditation System (KAS). These listings are current as of March 2012, but will likely change in the future as more Accreditation Bodies undergo the required peer evaluations in order to become signatory members of the MLA. Each Accreditation Body is required to keep a listing of those organizations it accredits, as well as a Scope of Accreditation which details the activities that the organizations can perform, whether that be testing, inspection, or product certification.[2] Accreditation Bodies routinely audit[2] the Product Certifiers whom they have accredited in order to determine if the performance or actions of the organization have changed and do not meet the requirements of the Accreditation Body and the International Standards they are to conform to. It is not mandatory for each Accreditation Bodies to be member of IAF or to join IAF in any manner, there have been several accreditation Board like AB-CAB, ESMA, NACI etc. European Economic Area[edit] Within the European Economic Area (EEA), the majority of products are required to be ‘CE Marked’ and will have the letter CE on them. It shows that the manufacturer or importer has checked that these products meet EU safety, health or environmental requirements; is an indicator of a product’s compliance with EU legislation and allows the free movement of products within the European market. By placing the CE marking on a product, a manufacturer or importer is declaring, on his sole responsibility, conformity with all of the legal requirements to achieve CE marking. The manufacturer is thus ensuring validity for that product to be sold throughout the EEA. This also applies to products made in third countries which are sold in the EEA and Turkey. If you are a manufacturer it is your responsibility to: carry out the conformity assessment (including any testing, if required) set up the technical file issue the EC Declaration of Conformity (DoC) place CE marking on a product If you are a distributor you must check the presence of both the CE marking and the necessary supporting documentation. If you are importing a product that is from a third country you have to check that the manufacturer outside the EU has undertaken the necessary steps. You must check that the documentation is available. The Europa website gives details various product categories and the relevant EU directives to which products must conform. International applications[edit] This section possibly contains original research. Please improve it by verifying the claims made and adding inline citations. Statements consisting only of original research should be removed. (August 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) North America's nuclear industry is exempt from mandatory certification[citation needed]. This has allowed situations leading to remedial work such as for fireproofing of electrical circuits (circuit integrity) between nuclear reactor and control rooms in the U.S. In this case, submitors were permitted to dictate not only their test procedures, but also to construct test specimens in their own facilities, prior to fire tests on the part of laboratories. The primary example of this situation is the Thermo-Lag scandal, which came about as a result of disclosures by whistleblower Gerald W. Brown to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission as well as watchdog groups, members of US Congress, and the press. In Germany, the accredited testing organizations routinely audit manufacturing locations and submit quality control test results to DIBt. While the German laboratories do not possess process standards, their methodology can uncover changes in the nature and quality of ingredients, as DIBt establishes very clear tolerances for performance[citation needed].

Fairtrade is an association of three Producer Networks, 19 National Fairtrade Organizations (formerly: Fairtrade Labelling Organizations) and 8 Fairtrade Marketing Organizations that promote and market the Fairtrade Certification Mark in their countries [2] Producer Networks exist in Latin America and The Caribbeans; Africa and Middle East; Asia and Pacific. National Fairtrade Organizations exist in 16 European countries as well as in Canada, the United States, Japan, Australia and New Zealand.[3] Fairtrade International also oversees Fairtrade Marketing Organizations in the Czech Republic, Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, India, Philippines, and Poland.[3] Contents 1 History 2 Membership 3 Structure 4 Fairtrade standards 5 International Fairtrade Certification Mark 6 References 7 External links History[edit] Fairtrade International was established in 1997. To ensure compliance with the Fairtrade standards relating to labour standards, cooperative organization, and the governance of the Fairtrade benefits, the organization was divided in January 2004 into two independent organizations:[4] Fairtrade International develops and reviews Fairtrade Standards and assists producers in gaining and maintaining certification and in capitalizing on market opportunities on the Fairtrade market. To ensure the transparency of the system, the standards are developed and reviewed by the FLO Standards and Policy Committee, in which FLO members, producer organizations, traders and external experts participate. FLOCERT ensures that producers and traders comply with the FLO Fairtrade Standards and that producers invest the benefits received through Fairtrade in their development. Operating independently from any other interests, it follows the international ISO standards for certification bodies (ISO 65).

Implements all the commodity facing work, as well as programs on living income, living wages, and climate change Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning- Data governance and management, research and impact. External Relations - In charge of resource mobilization, communications and advocacy Branding, Trademark, and Licensing. Promotes the integrity of the Fairtrade Mark and relationships with licensees. The coordination of all global activities is led by a Global Leadership Team, made of the CEO, the COO, and the CVO (Chief Value Officer) Fairtrade standards[edit] Given the development focus of fair trade, related standards contain minimum requirements that all producer organisations must meet to become certified as well as progress requirements in which producers must demonstrate improvements over time. There are two types of fair trade standards for disadvantaged[vague] producers: standards for small farmers' organizations and for hired labor situations. Small farmers' organization standards include requirements for democratic decision making, ensuring that producers have a say in how the fair trade premiums are invested, etc. They also include requirements for capacity building and economic strengthening of the organization. Hired labour situation standards seek to ensure that employees receive decent[vague] wages and may join unions and bargain collectively. Fairtrade certified plantations must also ensure that there is no forced or child labour and that health and safety requirements are met. In a hired labor situation, fair trade standards require a ""joint body"" to be set up with representatives from both management and employees. This joint body decides on how fairtrade premiums will be spent to benefit plantation employees. A list of hazardous materials whose use in production of Fairtrade products is prohibited is maintained by Fairtrade International, along with materials whose use is ""restricted"", only to be used in specified conditions, and a list of other hazardous materials which are ""flagged"" as being hazardous and only to be used ""under extreme caution"". These lists are known as the ""red list"", ""orange list"" and ""yellow list"" respectively.[6] For some products, such as coffee, only fair trade standards for small farmers' organizations are applicable. For others, such as tea, both small farmers' organizations and plantations can be certified. Fair trade standards and procedures are approved by the FLO Standards Committee, an external committee comprising all FLO stakeholders (labeling initiatives, producers, and traders) and external experts. Fair trade standards are set in accordance to the requirements of the ISEAL Code of Good Practice in standards setting and are in addition the result of an extensive consultation process, involving a variety of stakeholders: producers, traders, external experts, inspectors, certification staff etc.[7] International Fairtrade Certification Mark[edit] Main article: International Fairtrade Certification Mark The Fairtrade Mark is an international independent consumer Mark which appears on products as a guarantee that producers and traders have met fair trade standards. The Fairtrade Mark is owned and protected by Fairtrade International, on behalf of its 25-member and associate member labeling initiatives and producer networks. For a product to carry the Fairtrade Mark, it must come from FLOCERT inspected and certified producer organizations. The crops must be grown and harvested in accordance with the International Fairtrade Standards set by Fairtrade International. The supply chain is also monitored by FLOCERT to ensure the integrity of labelled products. Only authorized licensees can use the Fairtrade Mark on their products.

Membership[edit] The following are National Fairtrade Organizations and Fairtrade Marketing Organizations:[5] Fairtrade Australia and New Zealand Fairtrade Österreich Fairtrade Belgium Fairtrade Canada The Czech Fairtrade Association (Fairtrade Marketing Organization for Czech Republic and Slovakia) Max Havelaar Danmark Reilun kaupan edistämisyhdistys Association Max Havelaar France TransFair Deutschland Fairtrade Hong Kong Foundation (Fairtrade Marketing Organization) Fairtrade Mark Ireland Fairtrade Italia TransFair Japan Fairtrade Korea (Fairtrade Marketing Organization) TransFair-Minka Luxembourg Stichting Max Havelaar Fairtrade Max Havelaar Norge Asociación del Sello de Productos de Comercio Justo (National Fairtrade Organization for Spain and Portugal) Fairtrade Sverige Max Havelaar Foundation The Fairtrade Foundation Fairtrade America Fairtrade Taiwan Fairtrade India Fundacja „Koalicja Sprawiedliwego Handlu” – Fairtrade Polska (Fairtrade Marketing Organization) These initiatives were joined in 2007 by three Producer Networks: Network of Asian and Pacific Producers (NAPP) Coordinadora Latinoamericana y del Caribe de Pequeños Productores de Comercio Justo (CLAC) Fairtrade Africa Structure[edit] Fairtrade International is divided into six units: Standards and Pricing—sets and maintains fair trade standards Finance, Operations and Central Services—ensures coordinated communications, finance, human resources, fundraising, and IT services Global Products, Programs, and Policies. Implements all the commodity facing work, as well as programs on living income, living wages, and climate change Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning- Data governance and management, research and impact. External Relations - In charge of resource mobilization, communications and advocacy Branding, Trademark, and Licensing. Promotes the integrity of the Fairtrade Mark and relationships with licensees. The coordination of all global activities is led by a Global Leadership Team, made of the CEO, the COO, and the CVO (Chief Value Officer) Fairtrade standards[edit] Given the development focus of fair trade, related standards contain minimum requirements that all producer organisations must meet to become certified as well as progress requirements in which producers must demonstrate improvements over time. There are two types of fair trade standards for disadvantaged[vague] producers: standards for small farmers' organizations and for hired labor situations. Small farmers' organization standards include requirements for democratic decision making, ensuring that producers have a say in how the fair trade premiums are invested, etc. They also include requirements for capacity building and economic strengthening of the organization. Hired labour situation standards seek to ensure that employees receive decent[vague] wages and may join unions and bargain collectively. Fairtrade certified plantations must also ensure that there is no forced or child labour and that health and safety requirements are met. In a hired labor situation, fair trade standards require a ""joint body"" to be set up with representatives from both management and employees. This joint body decides on how fairtrade premiums will be spent to benefit plantation employees. A list of hazardous materials whose use in production of Fairtrade products is prohibited is maintained by Fairtrade International, along with materials whose use is ""restricted"", only to be used in specified conditions, and a list of other hazardous materials which are ""flagged"" as being hazardous and only to be used ""under extreme caution"". These lists are known as the ""red list"", ""orange list"" and ""yellow list"" respectively.[6] For some products, such as coffee, only fair trade standards for small farmers' organizations are applicable. For others, such as tea, both small farmers' organizations and plantations can be certified. Fair trade standards and procedures are approved by the FLO Standards Committee, an external committee comprising all FLO stakeholders (labeling initiatives, producers, and traders) and external experts. Fair trade standards are set in accordance to the requirements of the ISEAL Code of Good Practice in standards setting and are in addition the result of an extensive consultation process, involving a variety of stakeholders: producers, traders, external experts, inspectors, certification staff etc.[7] International Fairtrade Certification Mark[edit] Main article: International Fairtrade Certification Mark The Fairtrade Mark is an international independent consumer Mark which appears on products as a guarantee that producers and traders have met fair trade standards. The Fairtrade Mark is owned and protected by Fairtrade International, on behalf of its 25-member and associate member labeling initiatives and producer networks. For a product to carry the Fairtrade Mark, it must come from FLOCERT inspected and certified producer organizations. The crops must be grown and harvested in accordance with the International Fairtrade Standards set by Fairtrade International. The supply chain is also monitored by FLOCERT to ensure the integrity of labelled products. Only authorized licensees can use the Fairtrade Mark on their products.

Here’s what they’re saying about the books they can’t put down.1. ""Four Fish: The Future of the Last Wild Food"" by Paul Greenberg This book is a must-read for anyone interested in ocean issues, and in our relationship with the last wild food that humans consume at a significant scale. The author beautifully recounts what fishing used to be like, sheds light on disturbing trends in fishing practices today, and offers diverse and insightful solutions to ensure that we keep oceans healthy and people fed.— Pablo Obregon, Senior Program Manager - Fisheries2. “The Overstory” by Richard Powers I can’t adequately express how affected I was by Richard Powers’ novel “The Overstory.” Even though I was already an environmentalist, this Pulitzer-Prize winner gave me a completely new appreciation for trees and the natural world. It’s not an easy read, I admit, but it’s so, so worth it.— Marsea Nelson, senior communications manager for the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund3. “The Hidden Life of Trees: What They Feel, How They Communicate: Discoveries from a Secret World” by Peter Wohlleben This book had been on my to-read list since it was first published in 2015 and I’d strongly recommend others add it to their lists as well. The author spent more than 20 years working in commercial forestry and opens the door to the hidden world of trees — from how they communicate with their “children” and provide nutrients to sick neighbors, to how they warn each other of nearby predators and coordinate as a group during pollination season. After reading, I guarantee you’ll never be able to look out your window or go for a walk without appreciating how interconnected and complicated nature can be. It’s awe-inspiring.  — Stephanie Businelli, manager of strategic global communications4. ""The Sound of a Wild Snail Eating"" by Elisabeth Tova Bailey A dear friend sent this beautiful book to me when I had to self-quarantine after a potential exposure to COVID-19, and it has provided much-needed solace and perspective during these strange times. Also forced to stay indoors, the author — who suffers from a neurological illness — delves into the minutiae of a wild snail, blending scientific details with lyrical reflections on humans and our connections to the natural world. It's just a pure joy to read.— Cassandra Kane, communications manager of conservation finance 5. “All We Can Save: Truth, Courage, and Solutions for the Climate Crisis” by Ayana Elizabeth Johnson, Katharine Keeble Wilkinson and more Dr. Ayana Elizabeth Johnson is a marine biologist and climate leader who I have looked up to for quite some time now, so when I saw that this book was coming out, I knew I needed to pre-order it. Johnson co-edited “All We Can Save” with Dr. Katharine K. Wilkinson — climate author, teacher, strategist and feminist. Environmentalists frequently note that women are vital voices in the climate movement, but too often they are not given a seat at the table. “All We Can Save” is a diverse collection of essays and poetry sharing stories of truth, courage and solutions by powerhouse female leaders at the forefront of the climate movement. This book prioritizes and uplifts female voices, including writers, scientists and activists who are Black, Indigenous and people of color. It is informative and inspiring.— Mallory Henig, annual and planned giving manager 6. “Vesper Flights” by Helen Macdonald Equal parts meditation and call to arms, Helen MacDonald’s new essay collection is a book about birds that’s somehow also about everything else — the politics of migration, the confusion of young adulthood and the grief of climate change. Above all, though, this is a book about nature’s ability to inspire awe. Equally wondrous are her sentences, which made me gasp (and startle my dog) on multiple occasions. — Raul Quintana, senior writer Kiley Price is a staff writer and news editor at Conservation International.Want to read more stories like this? Sign up for email updates. Donate to Conservation International.Cover image: A sea lion in the Galápagos Islands (© Will Turner)Further reading:Nature meets culture: A peacebuilding podcast, an African oasis and moreNature meets culture: A whale’s world, a cure for climate fatigue and moreIn the high seas, scientists uncover a ‘vortex of life’ SHARE Facebook TWEET Twitter SHARE Linkedin SEND Email Facebook Twitter LinkedIn MailTo Follow Facebook Twitter YouTube Instagram RSS Resources Newsroom Videos Conservation News Blog About Us Mission + Vision Our Centers Annual Reports + Financials Our Policies Ethics Hotline Leadership Board of Directors Senior Staff Leadership Council We're proud to be recognized as a financially accountable and transparent organization.

118,"Edward Buxton (conservationist) - Wikipedia Edward Buxton (conservationist) From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Edward North Buxton (1 September 1840 – 9 January 1924) was a British conservationist and Liberal Party politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1885 to 1886. He was also an alpine climber, with significant first or second ascents in the 1860s, including the Aiguille de Bionnassay,[1] Piz Palu and the first traverse of Lyskamm.[2] Buxton was the third son of Sir Edward North Buxton, 2nd Baronet (1812–1858), and his wife, Catherine Gurney. Both father and son were called ""Edward North Buxton"" and both became Members of Parliament. Buxton was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge.[3] He was a partner in the London brewing firm of Truman, Hanbury, & Co. and a J.P. and a Deputy Lieutenant for Essex.[4] Buxton stood for parliament unsuccessfully at South Essex in 1880. In 1885, he was elected MP for the Walthamstow constituency as a Liberal: he made six contributions during his year as an MP.[5] Buxton was an advocate of the provision of open, accessible land, particularly near cities. He and his brother Thomas played a major part in saving Epping Forest and Hainault Forests for public use. He was a verderer of Hatfield Forest, which he purchased for the National Trust from his deathbed.[6] He was a founding member of the Society for the Preservation of the Wild Fauna of the Empire,[7] now Fauna and Flora International.[8] In 1862, Buxton married Emily Digby, the daughter of the Rev. the Hon. Kenelm Henry Digby, Rector of Tittleshall and Hon. Canon of Norwich, and sister of Sir Kenelm Digby. Buxton died at the age of 83. His home, Leytonstone House, carries a blue plaque.[9] He is also commemorated by an inscription in the council chamber of Essex County Council. Bibliography[edit] The ABC of Free Trade.

He is the elder son of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Diana, Princess of Wales. Since birth, he has been second in the line of succession to the British throne. Born in St Mary's Hospital, London, William was educated at Wetherby School, Ludgrove School and Eton College. He spent parts of his gap year in Belize and Chile before earning a Scottish Master of Arts degree in geography at the University of St Andrews. William then trained at Royal Military Academy Sandhurst prior to serving with the Blues and Royals. In April 2008, William graduated from Royal Air Force College Cranwell, joining RAF Search and Rescue Force in early 2009. He served as a full-time pilot with the East Anglian Air Ambulance from July 2015 for two years. The Duke performs official duties and engagements on behalf of the Queen.[3] He holds patronage with over 30 charitable and military organisations, including the Tusk Trust, Centrepoint, and London's Air Ambulance Charity.

In December 2014, he founded the ""United for Wildlife"" initiative, which aims to reduce worldwide illegal wildlife trade. In April 2016, the Cambridges and Prince Harry initiated the mental health awareness campaign ""Heads Together"" to encourage people to open up about their mental health issues. In October 2020, William launched the Earthshot Prize, a £50 million initiative to incentivise environmental solutions over the next decade. In 2011, William was made Duke of Cambridge preceding his marriage to Catherine Middleton. The couple have three children: Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis of Cambridge.

William had six godparents: former King Constantine II of Greece (his paternal second cousin once removed); Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Mrs Ogilvy (his paternal first cousin twice removed); the Duchess of Westminster; Lady Susan Hussey; Lord Romsey (his paternal second cousin once removed); and Sir Laurens van der Post.[7] He was the first child born to a Prince and Princess of Wales since Prince John in 1905.[8] William accompanied his parents on their 1983 tour of Australia and New Zealand, when he was nine months old, as his first trip overseas.[9] He traveled with his family to Canada in 1991 and 1998.[10][11] Known informally as ""Wills"" within the family,[12] William was nicknamed ""Wombat"" by his mother,[13] who wished him and his younger brother, Harry, to obtain broader life experiences than those usually available to royal children. She took them to Walt Disney World and McDonald's, AIDS clinics, shelters for the homeless, and bought them items typically owned by teenagers, such as video games.[14] His parents divorced in 1996. Diana died in a car accident in the early hours of 31 August 1997. William, then aged 15, together with his 12-year-old brother and their father, were staying at Balmoral Castle at the time. The Prince of Wales waited until his sons awoke the following morning to tell them about their mother's death.[15] William accompanied his father, brother, paternal grandfather Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, and his maternal uncle Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer, at his mother's funeral. William and Harry walked behind the funeral cortège from Kensington Palace to Westminster Abbey.[16] Education William was educated at independent schools, starting at Jane Mynors' nursery school and the pre-preparatory Wetherby School, both in London.[17] Following this, he attended Ludgrove School near Wokingham, Berkshire, and was privately tutored during summers by Rory Stewart.[18] At Ludgrove, he participated in football, swimming, basketball, clay pigeon shooting, and cross country running. He sat the entrance exam to Eton College and was admitted. There, he studied Geography, Biology, and History of Art at A-Level, obtaining an 'A' in Geography, a 'C' in Biology, and a 'B' in History of Art.[19][20][21] At Eton, he took up water polo and continued to play football, captaining his house team.[22] The decision to place William in Eton went against the family tradition of sending royal children to Gordonstoun, which his grandfather, father, two uncles, and two cousins all attended. Diana's father and brother both attended Eton.[14] The royal family and the tabloid press agreed William would be allowed to study free from intrusion in exchange for regular updates about his life. John Wakeham, chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, said of the arrangement, ""Prince William is not an institution; nor a soap star; nor a football hero. He is a boy: in the next few years, perhaps the most important and sometimes painful part of his life, he will grow up and become a man.""[14] After completing his studies at Eton, William took a gap year, during which he took part in British Army training exercises in Belize,[23] worked on English dairy farms, visited Africa,[24] and for ten weeks taught children in southern Chile. As part of the Raleigh International programme in the town of Tortel, William lived with other young volunteers, sharing in the common household chores—including cleaning the toilet—and also volunteered as a guest disc jockey at a local radio station.[23] His interest in African culture prompted him to teach himself Swahili.[25] By 2001, William was back in the United Kingdom and had enrolled at the University of St Andrews.[26][27] The extra attention did not deter him; he embarked on a degree course in Art History, later changing his main subject to Geography. William wrote his dissertation on the coral reefs of Rodrigues in the Indian Ocean and graduated with Scottish Master of Arts degree with upper second class honours in 2005.[28][29][30] While at university, he represented the Scottish national universities water polo team at the Celtic Nations tournament in 2004.[22] He was known as ""Steve"" by other students to avoid any journalists overhearing and realising his identity.[31] William returned to St Andrews alongside his wife in February 2011 as patron of the university's 600th Anniversary Appeal.[32] Upon graduation from university, William interned in land management at Chatsworth House and in banking at HSBC.[14] To prepare for his eventual management of the Duchy of Cornwall, in 2014, he enrolled in a vocational agricultural management course at Cambridge, which was organised by the Cambridge Programme for Sustainability Leadership (CPSL), of which his father is patron.[33][34][35] According to a CNN report in 2014, the duchy is ""a £760 million (about $1.25 billion) entity established in 1337 to provide a private income for use by the reigning monarch's eldest son"", which William will inherit when his father becomes king.[33] Military and air ambulance service Military training and secondments William in Royal Air Force uniform at the 2010 Trooping the Colour Having decided to follow a military career, he was admitted to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in January 2006.[36] William officially received his commission as a lieutenant at midnight. As ""Lieutenant Wales""—a name based on his father's title Prince of Wales—he followed his younger brother[37] into the Blues and Royals as a troop commander in an armoured reconnaissance unit, after which he spent five months training for the post at Bovington Camp, Dorset.[38] William's position as second-in-line to the throne and the convention of ministers advising against placing that person into dangerous situations cast doubts on his chances of seeing combat, which increased after Prince Harry's deployment was cancelled in 2007 due to ""specific threats"". William, instead, went on to train in the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force, obtaining his commission as a sub-lieutenant in the former and flying officer in the latter—both broadly equivalent to the army rank of lieutenant. After completing his training, William undertook an attachment with the Royal Air Force at RAF Cranwell.[39][40] Upon completing the course he was presented with his RAF wings by his father,[41] who had received his own wings after training at Cranwell.[42] During this secondment, William flew to Afghanistan in a C-17 Globemaster that repatriated the body of Trooper Robert Pearson.[43] William was then seconded to train with the Royal Navy.[44] Whilst serving on HMS Iron Duke in June 2008, William participated in a £40m drug bust in the Atlantic, north-east of Barbados.[45] He was a part of the crew on the Lynx helicopter which helped seize 900 kg of cocaine from a speedboat.[46] Royal Air Force service William piloting a Sea King helicopter in 2010 In January 2009, William transferred his commission to the RAF and was promoted to Flight Lieutenant. He trained to become a helicopter pilot with the RAF's Search and Rescue Force. In January 2010, he graduated from the Defence Helicopter Flying School at RAF Shawbury.[47] On 26 January 2010, he transferred to the Search and Rescue Training Unit at RAF Valley, Anglesey, to receive training on the Sea King search and rescue helicopter; he graduated in September 2010.[48] This made him the first member of the British royal family since Henry VII to live in Wales.[49] William's first rescue mission as co-pilot of an RAF Sea King was a response to an emergency call from Liverpool Coastguard on 2 October 2010.[50] In November 2011, he participated in a search-and-rescue mission involving a cargo ship that was sinking in the Irish Sea; William, as a co-pilot, helped rescue two sailors.[51] William was deployed to the Falkland Islands for a six-week tour with No. 1564 Flight from February to March 2012.[52][53] The Argentine government condemned the Duke's deployment to the islands close to the 30th anniversary of the beginning of the Falklands War as a ""provocative act"".[54][55] In June 2012, Prince William gained a qualification to be captain or pilot in command of a Sea King rather than a co-pilot.[56] His active service as an RAF search-and-rescue pilot ended in September 2013.[57][58] Air ambulance pilot In 2014, it was announced that William would accept a full-time role as a pilot with the East Anglian Air Ambulance (EAAA) based at Cambridge Airport. Despite his qualifications as a military helicopter pilot, William needed a civil pilot's licence and further training before being permitted to take command of the Air Ambulance. Although his position was paid, Kensington Palace announced that William would donate his full salary to the EAAA charity.[59] He underwent part of his training as an EAAA pilot at Norwich Airport.[60] On 13 July 2015, William started his new job, which he felt was a natural progression from his previous role as an RAF search-and-rescue pilot.[61] The Duke described working irregular shifts and dealing mostly with critical care cases.[62] He also publicly discussed the consequences, witnessing intensive trauma and bereavement as an emergency worker, stating that it impacted his mental health and personal life.[63] BBC has written that the Duke was ""exposed to the National Health Service in a way that no other senior royal has been or possibly ever will be.""[64] William left his position with EAAA in July 2017 to assume full-time royal duties on behalf of his grandmother.[65][64] After supporting an anniversary campaign for London's Air Ambulance Charity in 2019, the Duke became the charity's official patron in March 2020.[66] In May 2020, he granted permission to the charity to use Kensington Palace's private lawn to refuel during the COVID-19 pandemic.[67] To mark Air Ambulance Week 2020, he wrote a letter thanking air ambulance workers, stating his ""profound respect"" for the community, particularly during the ""immeasurably difficult"" outbreak, and stated that ""the country owes you an enormous debt of gratitude.""[68][69] Personal life Bachelorhood In 2001, William met Catherine Middleton while they were students in residence at St Salvator's Hall at the University of St Andrews.[70] She reportedly caught William's attention at a charity fashion show on campus.[71] The couple began dating in 2003.[72] During their second year, William shared a flat with Middleton and two other friends.[73] From 2003 to 2005, they both resided at Balgove House on the Strathtyrum estate with two roommates.[74][75] Their relationship was followed so closely by the tabloid press that bookmakers took bets on the possibility of marriage, and the retail chain Woolworths produced memorabilia bearing their likenesses.[76] Media attention became so intense that William formally asked the press to keep their distance from Middleton.[76] On 15 December 2006, Middleton attended Prince William's Passing Out Parade at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst.[77][78] In April 2007, William and Middleton ended their relationship.[79] Middleton and her family attended the Concert for Diana in July 2007 at Wembley Stadium,[73] where she and Prince William sat two rows apart. The couple were subsequently seen together in public on a number of occasions and news sources stated that they had ""rekindled their relationship"".[80] Middleton was in attendance during the Order of the Garter procession ceremony at Windsor Castle in June 2008, where Prince William was made a Royal Knight of the Garter.[81] In June 2010, the couple moved into a cottage on the Bodorgan Estate in Anglesey, Wales, where William resided during his RAF search-and-rescue training and subsequent career.[82][83][84] Marriage and children The Duke with his family at Trooping the Colour in 2019 On 16 November 2010, Clarence House announced that William and Catherine were to marry; the couple had become engaged in Kenya in October.[85] The engagement ring given by William to Catherine had belonged to his mother. The wedding took place on 29 April 2011 in Westminster Abbey, London.[86] A few hours before the ceremony, William's new titles Duke of Cambridge, Earl of Strathearn, and Baron Carrickfergus were announced.[87][88][89][90] Estimates of the global audience for the wedding ranged around 300 million or more, whilst 26 million watched the event live in Britain alone.[91][92][93] The couple were given the country home, Anmer Hall, on the Sandringham Estate, as a wedding gift from the Queen.[94] The Duke and Duchess owned an English Cocker Spaniel, Lupo, from December 2011 to November 2020.[95] Catherine's first pregnancy was announced on 3 December 2012.[96] She was admitted on 22 July 2013 to the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital, London, where Prince William had been delivered. Later that day, she gave birth to Prince George.[97][98] On 8 September 2014, it was announced that the Duchess of Cambridge was pregnant with her second child.[99] She was admitted on 2 May 2015 to the same hospital and gave birth to Princess Charlotte.[100] The Duchess's third pregnancy was announced on 4 September 2017;[101] Prince Louis was born on 23 April 2018.[102] The family officially reside at Kensington Palace.[103] William is the godfather of Prince Constantine Alexios of Greece and Denmark (b. 1998), a distant relation though his grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh, and Mia Tindall (b. 2014), the eldest child of his paternal cousin, Zara Tindall.[104][105] Wealth and inheritance William and his brother Harry inherited the ""bulk"" of the £12.9 million left by their mother on their respective 30th birthdays, a figure that had grown since her 1997 death to £10 million each in 2014.[106][107] In 2002 The Times reported that William would also share with his brother a payment of £4.9 million from trust funds established by their great-grandmother, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, on their respective 21st birthdays and would share a payment of £8 million upon their respective 40th birthdays. As the eldest son of the heir-apparent, William is expected to inherit the Duchy of Cornwall, which would bring him an additional income.[108] In 2014, the brothers inherited their mother's wedding dress along with many other of her personal possessions including dresses, diamond tiaras, jewels, letters, and paintings. The brothers also received the original lyrics and score of ""Candle in the Wind"" by Bernie Taupin and Elton John as performed by John at Diana's funeral.[107] Health On 3 June 1991, William was admitted to Royal Berkshire Hospital after being accidentally hit on the forehead by a fellow pupil wielding a golf club. He suffered a depressed fracture of the skull and was operated on at Great Ormond Street Hospital, resulting in a permanent scar.[109] In a 2009 interview, he dubbed this scar a ""Harry Potter scar"" and said, ""I call it that because it glows sometimes and some people notice it—other times they don't notice it at all"".[110] On 1 November 2020, it was reported that William had tested positive for coronavirus in April but decided not to alert the media to 'avoid alarming the nation'.[111] The Daily Telegraph reported he had been ""very ill"" and had isolated away from his family.[112] Public life See also: List of official overseas trips made by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge At the age of 21, William was appointed a Counsellor of State; he first served in that capacity when the Queen attended the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in 2003.

Analysts from The Times believed the photographs were taken from the D22 (Vaucluse) road half a kilometre from the pool—a distance that would require an 800-mm or a 1000-mm lens.[238] On 17 September 2012, the Duke and Duchess filed a criminal complaint with the French prosecution department and launched a claim for civil damages at the Tribunal de Grande Instance de Nanterre.[239] The following day the courts granted an injunction against Closer prohibiting further publication of the photographs and announced a criminal investigation would be initiated.[240] Under French law, punitive damages cannot be awarded[241] but intrusions of privacy are a criminal offence carrying a maximum jail sentence of one year and a fine of up to €45,000 for individuals and €225,000 for companies.[242][243] In September 2017, Closer was fined €100,000 and its editor Laurence Pieau and owner Ernesto Mauri were each fined €45,000.[244] In August 2015, Kensington Palace published a letter detailing what it stated were the ""dangerous"" and invasive efforts of the media to get paparazzi pictures of Prince George and Princess Charlotte. Jason Knauf, communications secretary to the Cambridges, wrote the letter to media standards organisations in various countries.[245] In March 2017, a video of William ""dad dancing"" at a nightclub in Verbier, Switzerland surfaced in tabloid media.[246][247][248] At the time, he was on a skiing holiday, and was reportedly observed partying alongside friends and models.[249][247][250] The incident garnered commentary and criticism as it took place on Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey, which was attended by other senior members of the royal family.[246][247] The following month, when asked a music-related question during a BBC1 interview for the Heads Together campaign, he commented, referring to the reports: “I’ve got into enough trouble with my dancing recently. So it’s probably best to stay away from that one"".[251] In July 2021, ITV aired a documentary entitled Harry and William: What Went Wrong?, centering on the princes' relationship.[252] Before the film aired, footage of journalist Omid Scobie claiming that a senior aide from the Duke of Cambridge's household had briefed journalists about ""concerns regarding Prince Harry’s mental health"" was partially cut from the documentary after Kensington Palace informed the broadcaster that the claim was ""potentially defamatory"".[252] Titles, styles, honours, and arms Titles and styles 1982–2011: His Royal Highness Prince William of Wales 2011–present: His Royal Highness The Duke of Cambridge The hereditary titles of Duke of Cambridge, Earl of Strathearn, and Baron Carrickfergus were announced on 29 April 2011 and formally patented on 26 May that year.[87][fn 2] William uses the earldom in Scotland[254][255][256] and the barony in Northern Ireland.[257][258] He is a Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter (KG),[259] a Knight of the Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle (KT),[254] a member of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom (PC), and a Personal Aide-de-Camp (ADC) to the Queen.[260] As a British prince, William does not use a surname for everyday purposes. For formal and ceremonial purposes, children of the Prince of Wales use the title ""prince"" or ""princess"" before their forename and follow it with their father's territorial designation. Thus, before his marriage, Prince William was styled ""Prince William of Wales"". Such territorial designations are discarded by women when they marry and by men if they are given a peerage of their own,[261] such as when Prince William was given his dukedom. Although the name of the Royal House is Windsor, the surname Mountbatten-Windsor belongs to all the children and male-line descendants of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, and is used, if needed, by those who do not have the style of Royal Highness and the title Prince or Princess;[262] when a female descendant marries, she traditionally takes her husband's surname from that point onward, and their children take their father's. Both Princes William and Harry used Wales as their surname for military purposes; this continues to be the case for William since his creation as Duke of Cambridge.[263] Military ranks United Kingdom British Army 8 January 2006: Officer cadet[264] 16 December 2006: Cornet (Second Lieutenant), The Blues and Royals (short service commission)[265] 16 December 2006: Lieutenant, The Blues and Royals[265] 1 January 2009: Captain, The Blues and Royals (and transferred to a full regular commission)[266] 1 January 2016: Major[267] Royal Navy 1 January 2008: Sub-lieutenant[268] 1 January 2009: Lieutenant[269] 1 January 2016: Lieutenant Commander[270] Royal Air Force 1 January 2008: Flying Officer[271] 1 January 2009: Flight Lieutenant[272] 1 January 2016: Squadron Leader[273][274] Honours See also: List of honours of the British Royal Family by country Accompanied by his father, Prince William proceeds to St George's Chapel, Windsor to be installed as a Knight of the Garter. Prince William is the 1,000th member of the register of the Order of the Garter,[275] and was officially invested by the Queen on 16 June 2008 at a service at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.[276] The last time a monarch appointed a grandchild into the Order of the Garter was in 1894, when Queen Victoria invested Alfred, Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. 23 April 2008: Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter (KG)[277] 25 May 2012: Extra Knight of the Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle (KT)[278][279][280] Medals 6 February 2002: Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal 6 February 2012: Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal Commonwealth honours 30 October 2017: Tuvalu Order of Merit[281] Appointments The Duke of Cambridge in uniform as Colonel of the Irish Guards in 2013 Since 6 July 2009: Honorary Bencher of the Honourable Society of the Middle Temple.[282] Since 23 June 2010: Royal Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS)[283][284] 17 March 2013: Personal Aide-de-Camp to Her Majesty The Queen (ADC)[260] 9 June 2016: Member of Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council (PC)[285] Since 1 March 2017: Royal Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (HonFRSE)[286] Since 17 January 2018: Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Medicine (FRSM)[287] 25 January 2020, 22 March 2021: Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland[288][289] Honorary military appointments Canada 10 November 2009: Canadian Ranger[290] United Kingdom Since 8 August 2006: Commodore-in-Chief of the Royal Navy Submarine Service Since 8 August 2006: Commodore-in-Chief of Scotland[291] Since 3 October 2008: Honorary Air Commandant of RAF Coningsby[292] Since 10 February 2011: Colonel of the Irish Guards[293][294] Eponyms Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge Award, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario[295][296] Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's Parks Canada Youth Ambassadors Program[297] Duke of Cambridge Public School, Bowmanville, Ontario[298] Arms Coat of arms of the Duke of Cambridge Notes Prince William was granted a personal coat of arms on his 18th birthday. It is based on the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom, with a white (or silver) label with three points, the centre point bearing a red clam shell (an ""escallop""), to distinguish it from the arms of other members of the Royal Family. The escallop is drawn from the Spencer coat of arms, a reference to his mother, who was the daughter of the Earl Spencer.[299] Adopted 21 June 2000 Helm Upon a coronet of the children of the Heir Apparent, the royal helm Or Escutcheon Quarterly: 1st and 4th, Gules, three lions passant guardant in pale Or (England); 2nd, Or, a lion rampant within a double tressure flory counterflory Gules (Scotland); 3rd, Azure, a harp Or stringed Argent (Ireland).

Banner The Royal Standard of the United Kingdom labelled for difference as in his arms. (Alternative in Scotland) Symbolism As the eldest son of the Prince of Wales, Prince William's coat of arms has a label of three points.[300] The escallop (seashell) alludes to his late mother Diana, Princess of Wales, whose Spencer coat of arms includes three escallops Argent. In September 2013, the Queen granted to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge a conjugal coat of arms consisting of their individual arms displayed side-by-side beneath a helm and coronet denoting the Duke's status as grandson of the Sovereign.[301] Personal flag for Canada Main article: Royal standards of Canada Flag of the Duke of Cambridge for personal use in Canada In 2011, the Canadian Heraldic Authority introduced a personal heraldic flag for the Duke of Cambridge's use in Canada. It is the Royal Arms of Canada in banner form defaced with a blue roundel surrounded with a wreath of gold maple leaves and shells within which is a depiction of a ""W"" surmounted by a coronet. Above the roundel is a white label of three points, charged with a red shell.[302][303][304] Ancestry William is a member of the House of Windsor. Patrilineally, he descends from the House of Oldenburg, one of Europe's oldest royal houses; and more specifically the cadet branch known as the House of Glücksburg.[305] Through his mother, William descends from the Earls Spencer—a cadet branch of the Spencer family descended from the Earls of Sunderland; the senior branch are now also Dukes of Marlborough; the Barons Fermoy; and more anciently from Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Grafton, and Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond—two illegitimate sons of King Charles II. As king, William would be the first monarch since Anne to descend from Charles I and the first to descend from Charles II.[306][307] William descends matrilineally from Eliza Kewark, a housekeeper for his eighteenth-century ancestor Theodore Forbes—a Scottish merchant who worked for the East India Company in Surat. She is variously described in contemporary documents as ""a dark-skinned native woman"", ""an Armenian woman from Bombay"", and ""Mrs. Forbesian"".[307] Genealogist William Addams Reitwiesner assumed Kewark was Armenian.[308] In June 2013, BritainsDNA announced that genealogical DNA tests on two of William's distant matrilineal cousins confirm Kewark was matrilineally of Indian descent.[306][309][310][311] Ancestors of Prince William, Duke of Cambridge 8.

Fue conducido por el ingeniero ambiental Oswaldo Juep Danducho, representante de la CODEPISAM e integrante del Equipo Técnico y del Comité Técnico del proceso de ZF. Su exposición contó con el apoyo del ingeniero Edwin Silva Matta de la ARA y permitió a los asistentes entender de manera satisfactoria el proceso y sus fines.Este espacio de diálogo facilitó, además, que los dirigentes resolvieran dudas referidas al impacto que la ZF pudiera tener para los pueblos indígenas y, también, que se absuelvan dudas sobre otros temas relacionados con las funciones de la ARA, demostrando la pertinencia de reuniones similares con este y otros actores.Esta actividad será seguida de 8 talleres más, dirigidos a las autoridades de las comunidades que conforman las federaciones de base que integran la CODEPISAM y será conducido por los propios líderes de las Federaciones con el apoyo de la ARA. Posteriormente, cada líder comunal presentará el proceso de Zonificación Forestal ante la asamblea de su comunidad, cubriendo así a las casi 125 comunidades nativas de la región San Martín.Desde el año 2014, San Martín lidera el proceso de ZF a nivel nacional, logrando avances hasta la fecha que sirven de experiencia para otras regiones que recién lo inician. Una de ellas es, sin duda, reforzar la participación de los pueblos indígenas desde el inicio del proceso, integrando a la CODEPISAM a instancias técnicas y de toma de decisión como el Equipo Técnico y el Comité Técnico, conformados por representantes de las instituciones involucradas en la gestión forestal tanto de nivel regional como nacional.La ZF es impulsada por el Servicio Nacional Forestal y de Fauna Silvestre (SERFOR) y el Gobierno Regional de San Martín, y se lleva a cabo en el marco de las actividades de apoyo a la Declaración Conjunta de Intención (DCI), ejecutadas por el Programa de las Naciones Unidas para el Desarrollo (PNUD), gracias a la cooperación de Noruega, a través del proyecto PNUD - DCI.El Dato: Continuando con el fortalecimiento de capacidades a diversos actores del proceso de ZF, el próximo taller con organizaciones indígenas se realizará el jueves 19 de abril con la Federación de los Pueblos Indígenas Kechwas de la Región San Martín (FEPIKRESAM), en la ciudad de Lamas.

Asimismo, se presentaron los requisitos que debe cumplir cada comunidad que desea ser parte del Programa Bosques y los pasos conjuntos que se desarrollan una vez que la comunidad expresa su deseo, mediante asamblea comunal y de forma voluntaria, de participar del Programa. De las comunidades participantes, Chirik Sacha y Mushuk Llakta de Chipaota ya trabajan en forma conjunta con el Programa Bosques. La primera suscribió un Convenio de Conservación en el 2012 y está implementando un Plan de Inversión en beneficio de sus bosques y de su población. La segunda ya aceptó ser parte del Programa al presentar su Carta de Expresión de Interés, por decisión de toda su población. La comunidad de Chunchiwi, Chirik Yaku y Cachiyaku están recibiendo toda la información necesaria para                                                                                      decidir si aceptan o no ser parte del Programa. Cabe resaltar que para asegurar la participación de las comunidades en el taller, el Equipo Zonal del Programa Bosques en San Martín realizó una vista a cada comunidad para propiciar un primer acercamiento y entregarles una carta de presentación e invitación como parte del proceso de consulta previa.",Federación de Pueblos Indígenas Kechwas de la Región de San Martín

También  realizamos nuestras actividades en coordinación con el Gobierno Regional de San Martín, a través de su Oficina Regional de Desarrollo de los Pueblos Indígenas – ORDEPISAM, que se encuentra bajo la Gerencia de Desarrollo Social. © CI/Bailey Evans A nivel localTrabajamos a través de la FERIAAM y el apoyo a las comunidades nativas, principalmente en las Comunidades Nativas de Shampuyacu y Alto Mayo. CI implementa, junto a instituciones socias, acciones a través de distintos proyectos que apuntan a devolverle la salud al medio ambiente y por ende, el bienestar a sus comunidades. Estas acciones son canalizadas mediante el desarrollo de un modelo de acuerdos de conservación con las comunidades. La Comunidad Nativa Awajún de Shampuyacu será la primera en recibir los beneficios de este modelo de acuerdos de conservación, que además esta siendo diseñado para servir de modelo de distribución de beneficios para futuros programas REDD+ o de pago por servicios ecosistemicos del Gobierno Peruano. Nuestro planImplementamos diferentes tipos de actividades con las comunidades nativas y sus líderes, a fin de alcanzar objetivos comunes de desarrollo. Gobernanza En CI buscamos que las comunidades puedan gestionar el uso de sus recursos naturales de forma sostenible y que sus decisiones puedan responder a sus necesidades. Para este fin, apoyamos a las comunidades tanto en el fortalecimiento de las relaciones entre hombres y mujeres a través de capacitaciones en igualdad de oportunidades, capacidades organizativas y resolución de conflictos; como a través del fortalecimiento de sus actividades a través de talleres en liderazgo, administración y diseño de proyectos. Todo ello en el marco del respeto y la conservación de su identidad cultural. Participación La participación plena y efectiva requiere de herramientas prácticas que permitan medir y evaluar el desempeño de los procesos participativos. A través de un Análisis de Involucramiento de Actores (SEA), enfocado en quienes están directamente relacionados con el uso y el manejo de los recursos forestales, CI ha logrado validar una metodología participativa que permite ser adaptada a otros contextos. Asimismo, todas las iniciativas que implementamos con las comunidades se aplican a través de la identificación de sus necesidades e intereses mediante talleres abiertos con los comuneros y comuneras. Capacitación A través de la metodología de CI, “Capacitación para Capacitadores”, representantes de los tres pueblos indígenas de San Martín - Kechwa, Shawi y Awajun – participaron en talleres informativos sobre cambio climático, los bosques y esquemas de pago por servicios ecosistémicos. Por otro lado, los directivos de la Federación Regional Indígena Awajún del Alto Mayo - FERIAAM están siendo capacitados por CI en temas de administración, contabilidad y diseño de proyectos. Además, reciben apoyo para la elaboración de sus distintos planes de presupuesto, proyectos y de operación institucional. Género Nuestro trabajo nos ha permitido aprender que los proyectos de conservación influencian a mujeres y hombres de forma distinta, en base a sus respectivos roles y responsabilidades, y que esto tiene un impacto directo en la sostenibilidad a largo plazo de los esfuerzos de conservación. En tal sentido, fomentamos la participación tanto de los hombres como de las mujeres a través de la aplicación de talleres de capacitación sobre igualdad de oportunidades para todos y todas, la evaluación de las políticas para hombres y mujeres, e incorporando este enfoque en todo nuestro trabajo. Manejo de recursos hídricos CI mantiene entre sus líneas de trabajo, la aplicación de herramientas técnicas para un mejor uso de los recursos hídricos. Se busca que las comunidades aprovechen responsablemente las canteras de sus ríos y que sean capaces de prevenir riesgos mediante la siembra de vegetación en zonas ribereñas suceptibles a la erosión. Acuerdos de conservación Los acuerdos de conservación son una herramienta que busca incentivar a las comunidades hacia la conservación a cambio de beneficios. Los acuerdos de conservación pueden ayudar a conservar y recuperar los bosques, fundamentales para el bienestar de todas y todos. En la actualidad, nos encontramos habilitando la aplicación de dichos acuerdos en la Comunidades Nativas Awajún de Shampuyacu y Alto Mayo. Entre las actividades priorizadas a promoverse, se ha identificado el manejo sostenible de sus recursos, incluyendo la implementación de actividades productivas y el cultivo de plantas medicinales, entre otros. ResultadosDesde 2013, CI viene implementando diversas líneas de acción para recuperar la vegetación y recursos naturales locales, así como para mejorar las condiciones de vida de los comuneros y comuneras. Los resultados a la fecha son: © CI/Andrea Wolfson 30,4 hectáreas de vegetación en recuperaciónSe viene restaurando la vegetación ribereña para reducir el riesgo por inundaciones y derrumbes que ocasionan la pérdida de sus hogares y cultivos. Este trabajo conjunto con los pobladores de Shampuyacu, ha permitido recuperar a la fecha más de 30 hectáreas de bosque ribereño. Liderazgo y planificación25 comuneros, entre representantes de las comunidades indígenas Awajún y de la FERIAAM, se encuentran capacitándose en temas de liderazgo, planificación y mecanismos de resolución de conflictos. Para esta capacitación se logró asegurar la participación tanto de hombres como de mujeres. Plan de vida comunitarioLa Comunidad Nativa ha elaborado, con apoyo de CI, un Plan de Vida Comunitario que les ha permitido planificar su propio desarrollo hasta el año 2020. Se han incluido temas importantes relacionados a la salud, educación, género, uso de caminos y gestión de recursos naturales. Escuelas de campo en gestión comunitariaRecientemente, se concluyó la implementación de una serie de “Escuelas de Campo”, (módulos temáticos de capacitación), en herramientas de gestión, enfocadas en las autoridades indígenas con el objetivo de fortalecer capacidades técnicas en administración y contabilidad. Estas fueron aplicadas a través de una metodología participativa que permitió una dinámica a base de diálogo y el establecimiento de compromisos. © CI/Freddy Guillen Bosque de las NuwasTras una fuerte iniciativa de las mujeres y la aceptación en Asamblea General de la comunidad, se les otorgó 9.8 hectáreas de bosque, donde cultivan y cosechan plantas y hierbas medicinales. En este espacio, llamado Bosque de las Nuwas (mujeres en awajún), participan 32 mujeres, quienes ahora pueden acceder a cultivar diversas plantas para tratar sus afecciones. Esta iniciativa les ha permitido también incrementar su conocimiento sobre hierbas tradicionales y recuperar tradiciones ancestrales. © Thomas Muller Viveros comunitariosLa comunidad implementó, con el apoyo de CI, cuatro viveros comunitarios para la producción de plantones de especies endémicas, a fin de restaurar la vegetación ribereña, y la conversión de cafetales a sistemas agroforestales, así como la producción de plantas medicinales.

El ministerio de Cultura informó este lunes que hay 13 regiones del país, de las 25 en total, que tienen prioridad en la jornada de vacunación y en las que se están difundiendo mensajes informativos en lenguas nativas para que los pobladores acepten su vacunación en forma libre y con pertinencia cultural. La pandemia, que ha dejado más de 193.000 fallecidos en Perú y más de 2 millones de contagios, también golpeó a los pueblos indígenas, aunque las cifras no son precisas. A mediados del año pasado, se estimaban alrededor de 400 muertos y 10.000 afectados por el virus. Ante ese panorama, desde el fin de semana último, empezó la inmunización de los pobladores shipibo-konibo de la comunidad Nuevo San Juan, en la región Ucayali, encabezados por el presidente de la Organización Regional en Ucayali (Orau) de la Asociación Interétnica de Desarrollo de la Selva Peruana (Aidesep), Berlín Diques, y el jefe o ""apu"" de la comunidad, Rolando Escobar. A su vez, el presidente de la Federación Nativa de Comunidades Cacataibo (Fenacoca), Herlín Odicio, recibió su dosis de la vacuna en el distrito de Aguaytía. Los gestores culturales que apoyan en esta labor llegan con megáfonos en mano a las comunidades indígenas para explicar la importancia de colocarse las vacunas y para esclarecer las dudas o temores de la población. DIRIGENTES DAN EL EJEMPLO A COMUNIDADES En la región Huánuco, las brigadas vacunaron al presidente de la Federación de Comunidades Nativas Yaneshas (Feconaya), Jaime Chihuanco; al jefe de la comunidad Guacamayo, Mashen Fabricio López, y al presidente de la Federación de Comunidades Nativas de la Provincia de Puerto Inca (Feconapia), Josué Fumanga, entre otros representantes nativos. La viceministra de Interculturalidad, Angela Acevedo, participó en la campaña y entregó banderolas en lenguas ashaninka, yanesha, shipibo-konibo y kakataibo para reforzar las recomendaciones del ministerio de Salud en prevención de la pandemia. En tanto, en la región Madre de Dios, en la frontera con Brasil y Bolivia, la vacunación abarcó a los pobladores de las comunidades harakbut, yine, matsiguenka, shipibo y ese eja, encabezados por sus ""apus"", como el presidente de la Federación Nativa del Río Madre de Dios y Afluentes (Fenamad), Julio Cusurichi. LA AMAZONÍA, EN EL FOCO DE INMUNIZACIÓN Otras regiones que empezaron su inmunización fueron Amazonas, en la frontera con Ecuador, donde el pueblo awajún recibió la vacuna, liderados por el jefe de la comunidad nazareth, Jorge Tiwi Jempeg, y el presidente de la Organización Regional de Pueblos Indígenas de la Amazonía Norte del Perú (Orpian-P), Salomón Awananch. En la selva central, la vacunación en la región San Martín se dirigió a la comunidad shawi, entre ellos a sus lideresas Loydi y Olinda Tangoa y al presidente de la Federación Regional Indígena Shawi de San Martín, Eusebio Huayunga. La campaña nacional de vacunación se ha dirigido, igualmente, a las comunidades andinas quechua en la región Apurímac en los distritos de Chacoche y Pichirhua, y en las localidades indígenas de Kirigeti y Miaria, en el distrito de Megantoni, provincia La Convención, de la región Cusco.

Situated where the Rhône exits Lake Geneva, it is the capital of the Republic and Canton of Geneva. The municipality (ville de Genève) has a population (as of December 2019[update]) of 203,951, and the canton (essentially the city and its inner-ring suburbs) has 504,128 residents.[5] In 2014, the compact agglomération du Grand Genève had 946,000 inhabitants in 212 communities in both Switzerland and France.[6] Within Swiss territory, the commuter area named ""Métropole lémanique"" contains a population of 1.26 million.[7][8] This area is essentially spread east from Geneva towards the Riviera area (Vevey, Montreux) and north-east towards Yverdon-les-Bains, in the neighbouring canton of Vaud. Geneva is a global city, a financial centre, and a worldwide centre for diplomacy due to the presence of numerous international organizations, including the headquarters of many agencies of the United Nations[9] and the Red Cross.[10] Geneva hosts the highest number of international organizations in the world.[11] It is also where the Geneva Conventions were signed, which chiefly concern the treatment of wartime non-combatants and prisoners of war. Together with, for instance, New York City (global headquarters of the UN), Basel (Bank for International Settlements), and Strasbourg (Council of Europe), Geneva is a city serving as the headquarters of one of the most important international organizations, without being the capital of a country.[12][13][14] In 2021, Geneva was ranked as the world's ninth most important financial centre for competitiveness by the Global Financial Centres Index, fifth in Europe behind London, Zürich, Frankfurt and Luxembourg.[15] In 2019, Geneva was ranked among the ten most liveable cities in the world by Mercer together with Zürich and Basel.[16] The city has been referred to as the world's most compact metropolis[17] and the ""Peace Capital"".[18] In 2019, Mercer ranked Geneva as the thirteenth most expensive city in the world.[19] In a UBS ranking of global cities in 2018, Geneva was ranked first for gross earnings, second most expensive, and fourth in purchasing power.[20] Contents 1 Name 2 History 3 Geography 3.1 Topography 3.2 Climate 4 Politics 4.1 Coat of arms 4.2 Administrative divisions 4.3 Government 4.4 Parliament 4.5 Elections 4.5.1 National Council 4.6 International relations 5 Demographics 5.1 Population 5.2 Historical population 5.3 Religion 5.3.1 ""Protestant Rome"" 5.4 Crime 6 Cityscape 7 Heritage sites of national significance 8 Society and culture 8.1 Media 8.2 Traditions and customs 8.3 Music and festivals 9 Education 10 Economy 11 Sport 12 Infrastructure 12.1 Transportation 12.2 Utilities 13 International organisations 14 Notable people 14.1 A–C 14.2 D–G 14.3 H–M 14.4 N-R 14.5 S–Z 15 See also 16 Notes and references 17 Bibliography 18 External links Name[edit] The city was mentioned in Latin texts, by Caesar, with the spelling Genava,[21] probably from the Celtic *genawa- from the stem *genu- (""bend, knee""), in the sense of a bending river or estuary, an etymology shared with the Italian port city of Genoa (in Italian Genova).[22] The medieval county of Geneva in Middle Latin was known as pagus major Genevensis or Comitatus Genevensis (also Gebennensis). After 1400 it became the Genevois province of Savoy (albeit not extending to the city proper, until the reformation of the seat of the Bishop of Geneva).[23] History[edit] Main articles: History of Geneva and Timeline of Geneva For the Catholic ecclesiastical history, see bishopric of Geneva. A view of Geneva by Frances Elizabeth Wynne, 4 August 1858 L'Escalade is what Genevans call the failed surprise attack of 12 December 1602 by troops sent by Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy, to take Geneva. This imaginative image was drawn by Matthias Quad, or the workshop of Frans Hogenberg, around 1603. Invaders are pictured crossing the moat in the center left while reinforcements are entering Plainpalais at the bottom. A column of defenders is in the center, headed toward the Savoyards. Lake Léman is at center top. Geneva was an Allobrogian border town, fortified against the Helvetii tribe,[24] when the Romans took it in 121 BC. It became Christian under the Late Roman Empire, and acquired its first bishop in the 5th century, having been connected to the Bishopric of Vienne in the 4th. Aerial view (1966) In the Middle Ages, Geneva was ruled by a count under the Holy Roman Empire until the late 14th century, when it was granted a charter giving it a high degree of self-governance. Around this time, the House of Savoy came to at least nominally dominate the city. In the 15th century, an oligarchic republican government emerged with the creation of the Grand Council. In the first half of the 16th century, the Protestant Reformation reached the city, causing religious strife, during which Savoy rule was thrown off and Geneva allied itself with the Swiss Confederacy. In 1541, with Protestantism on the rise, John Calvin, the Protestant Reformer and proponent of Calvinism, became the spiritual leader of the city and established the Republic of Geneva. By the 18th century, Geneva had come under the influence of Catholic France, which cultivated the city as its own. France tended to be at odds with the ordinary townsfolk, which inspired the failed Geneva Revolution of 1782, an attempt to win representation in the government for men of modest means. In 1798, revolutionary France under the Directory annexed Geneva. At the end of the Napoleonic Wars, on 1 June 1814, Geneva was admitted to the Swiss Confederation. In 1907, the separation of Church and State was adopted. Geneva flourished in the 19th and 20th centuries, becoming the seat of many international organizations.[25] Geography[edit] Topography[edit] Satellite view of Geneva; Cointrin Airport is centre left. Geneva is located at 46°12' North, 6°09' East, at the south-western end of Lake Geneva, where the Rhône flows out. It is surrounded by three mountain chains, each belonging to the Jura: the Jura main range lies north-westward, the Vuache southward, and the Salève south-eastward. The Geneva area seen from the Salève in France. The Jura mountains are on the horizon. The city covers an area of 15.93 km2 (6.2 sq mi), while the area of the canton is 282 km2 (108.9 sq mi), including the two small exclaves of Céligny in Vaud. The part of the lake that is attached to Geneva has an area of 38 km2 (14.7 sq mi) and is sometimes referred to as petit lac (small lake). The canton has only a 4.5-kilometre-long (2.8 mi) border with the rest of Switzerland. Of 107.5 km (66.8 mi) of border, 103 are shared with France, the Département de l'Ain to the north and west and the Département de la Haute-Savoie to the south and east. Of the land in the city, 0.24 km2 (0.093 sq mi), or 1.5%, is used for agricultural purposes, while 0.5 km2 (0.19 sq mi), or 3.1%, is forested. The rest of the land, 14.63 km2 (5.65 sq mi), or 91.8%, is built up (buildings or roads), 0.49 km2 (0.19 sq mi), or 3.1%, is either rivers or lakes and 0.02 km2 (4.9 acres), or 0.1%, is wasteland.[26] Of the built up area, industrial buildings made up 3.4%, housing and buildings made up 46.2% and transportation infrastructure 25.8%, while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 15.7%. Of the agricultural land, 0.3% is used for growing crops. Of the water in the municipality, 0.2% is composed of lakes and 2.9% is rivers and streams.[26] Confluence of the Rhône and the Arve The altitude of Geneva is 373.6 metres (1,225.7 ft) and corresponds to the altitude of the largest of the Pierres du Niton, two large rocks emerging from the lake which date from the last ice age. This rock was chosen by General Guillaume Henri Dufour as the reference point for surveying in Switzerland.[27] The second main river of Geneva is the Arve, which flows into the Rhône just west of the city centre. Mont Blanc can be seen from Geneva and is an hour's drive from the city. Climate[edit] Average temperature and precipitation 1961–1990[28] The climate of Geneva is a temperate climate, more specifically an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification: Cfb). Winters are cool, usually with light frosts at night and thawing conditions during the day. Summers are relatively warm. Precipitation is adequate and is relatively well-distributed throughout the year, although autumn is slightly wetter than other seasons. Ice storms near Lac Léman are normal in the winter: Geneva can be affected by the Bise, a north-easterly wind. This can lead to severe icing in winter.[29] In summer, many people swim in the lake and patronise public beaches such as Genève Plage and the Bains des Pâquis. The city, in certain years, receives snow during colder months. The nearby mountains are subject to substantial snowfall and are suitable for skiing. Many world-renowned ski resorts such as Verbier and Crans-Montana are less than three hours away by car. Mont Salève (1,379 m (4,524 ft)), just across the border in France, dominates the southerly view from the city centre, and Mont Blanc, the highest of the Alpine range, is visible from most of the city, towering high above Chamonix, which, along with Morzine, Le Grand Bornand, La Clusaz, and resorts of the Grand Massif such as Samoens, Morillon, and Flaine, are the closest French skiing destinations to Geneva. During the years 2000–2009, the mean yearly temperature was 11 °C and the mean number of sunshine-hours per year was 2003.[30] The highest temperature recorded in Genève–Cointrin was 39.7 °C (103.5 °F) in July 2015, and the lowest temperature recorded was −20.0 °C (−4.0 °F) in February 1956.

The right bank includes: (1) Saint-Jean and Charmilles; (2) Servette and Petit-Saconnex; (3) Grottes and Saint-Gervais; and (4) Paquis and Nations.[35] Government[edit] See also: List of mayors of Geneva Logo of the city of Geneva, 2004 The Administrative Council (Conseil administratif) constitutes the executive government of the city of Geneva and operates as a collegiate authority. It is composed of five councilors (French: Conseiller administratif/ Conseillère administrative), each presiding over a department. The president of the executive department acts as mayor (la maire/le maire). In the governmental year 2021–2022, the Administrative Council is presided over by Madame la maire de Genève Frédérique Perler. Departmental tasks, coordination measures and implementation of laws decreed by the Municipal Council are carried out by the Administrative Council. Elections for the Administrative Council are held every five years. The current term of (la législature) is from 1 June 2020 to 31 May 2025. The delegates are elected by means of a system of Majorz. The mayor and vice change each year, while the heads of the other departments are assigned by the collegiate. The executive body holds its meetings in the Palais Eynard, near the Parc des Bastions.[36] As of 2020[update], Geneva's Administrative Council is made up of two representatives each of the Social Democratic Party (PS) and the Green Party (PES), and one member of the Christian Democratic Party (PDC). This gives the left-wing parties four out of the five seats and, for the first time in history, a female majority. The last election was held on 15 March/5 April 2020.[37] Except for the mayor, all other councillors have been elected for the first time.[38] Le Conseil administratif of Geneva [38] Councillor(M. Conseiller administratif/ Mme Conseillère administrative) Party Head of Office (Département, since) of elected in Frédérique Perler[SR 1] PES Planning, Construction, and Mobility (de l'aménagement, des constructions et de la mobilité, 2020) 2020 Marie Barbey-Chappuisat[SR 2] PDC Security and Sport (de la sécurité et des sports, 2020) 2020 Sami Kanaan PS Culture and Digital Change (de la culture et de la transition numérique, 2020) 2011 Alfonso Gomez PES Finance, Environment and Housing (des finances, de l'environnement et du logement, 2020) 2020 Christina Kitsos PS Social Cohesion and Solidarity (de la cohésion sociale et de la solidarité, 2020) 2020 ^ Mayor (la maire de Genève) 2021/22 ^ Vice President (Vice-présidente) 2021/22 Parliament[edit] Le Conseil municipal of Geneva for the mandate period of 2020–2025 Ensemble à gauche (PST-POP & Sol) (8.8%)  PS (23.8%)  Les Verts (PES) (22.5%)  PDC (10%)  PLR (17.5%)  UDC (8.8%)  MCG (8.8%) The Municipal Council (Conseil municipal) holds legislative power. It is made up of 80 members, with elections held every five years. The Municipal Council makes regulations and by-laws that are executed by the Administrative Council and the administration. The delegates are selected by means of a system of proportional representation with a seven percent threshold. The sessions of the Municipal Council are public. Unlike members of the Administrative Council, members of the Municipal Council are not politicians by profession, and they are paid a fee based on their attendance. Any resident of Geneva allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the Municipal Council. The Council holds its meetings in the Town Hall (Hôtel de Ville), in the old city.[39] The last election of the Municipal Council was held on 15 March 2020 for the (législature) of 2020–2025. Currently, the Municipal Council consists of: 19 members of the Social Democratic Party (PS), 18 Green Party (PES), 14 Les Libéraux-Radicaux (PLR), 8 Christian Democratic People's Party (PDC); 7 Geneva Citizens' Movement (MCG,), 7 Ensemble à Gauche (an alliance of the left parties PST-POP (Parti Suisse du Travail – Parti Ouvrier et Populaire) and solidaritéS), 6 Swiss People's Party (UDC).[40] Elections[edit] National Council[edit] In the 2019 federal election for the Swiss National Council the most popular party was the Green Party which received 26% (+14.6) of the vote.

The next five most popular parties were the PLR (17.6%), the UDC (16.3%), the Green Party (11.4%), the PDC (10.7%), and the solidaritéS (8.8%). In the federal election a total of 36,490 votes were cast, and the voter turnout was 44.1%.[43] International relations[edit] Geneva does not have any sister relationships with other cities. It declares itself related to the entire world.[44][45] Demographics[edit] Population[edit] The Flowered Clock at the Quai du Général-Guisan (English Garden), during the 2012 Geneva Festival Rue Pierre-Fatio in Geneva Geneva has a population (as of December 2019[update]) of 203,951.[5] The city of Geneva is at the centre of the Geneva metropolitan area, known as Grand Genève in French (Greater Geneva). Greater Geneva includes the Canton of Geneva, the District of Nyon in the Canton of Vaud and several areas in the French departments of Haute-Savoie and Ain. In 2011, the agglomération franco-valdo-genevoise had 915,000 inhabitants, two-thirds of whom lived on Swiss soil and one-third on French soil.[46] The Geneva metropolitan area is experiencing steady demographic growth of 1.2% a year and the population of the agglomération franco-valdo-genevoise is expected to reach a total of one million people in the near future.[46] The official language of Geneva (both the city and the canton) is French. English is also common due to the high number of anglophone expatriates and foreigners working in international institutions and in the bank sector. As of 2000[update], 128,622 or 72.3% of the population speaks French as a first language, with English being the second most common (7,853 or 4.4%) language. 7,462 inhabitants speak Spanish (or 4.2%), 7,320 speak Italian (4.1%), 7,050 speak German (4.0%) and 113 people who speak Romansh.[47] As a result of immigration flows in the 1960s and 1980s, Portuguese is also spoken by a considerable proportion of the population. In the city of Geneva, as of 2013[update], 48% of the population are resident foreign nationals.[48] For a list of the largest groups of foreign residents see the cantonal overview.

There were also 3,959 members of an Orthodox church (2.22%), 220 individuals (or about 0.12% of the population) who belonged to the Christian Catholic Church of Switzerland, 2,422 (1.36%) who belonged to another Christian church, and 2,601 people (1.46%) who were Jewish. There were 707 individuals who were Buddhist, 474 who were Hindu and 423 who belonged to another church. 26,575 respondents (14.93%) did not answer the question.[47] According to 2012 statistics by Swiss Bundesamt für Statistik 49.2% of the population are Christian, divided into 34.2% Roman Catholic, 8.8% Swiss Reformed (organized in the Protestant Church of Geneva) and 6.2% other Christian (mostly various other Protestants), 38% of Genevans are non-religious, 6.1% are Muslim and 1.6% are Jews.[57] Geneva has historically been considered a Protestant city and was known as the Protestant Rome due to it being the base of John Calvin, William Farel, Theodore Beza and other Protestant reformers. Over the past century, substantial immigration from France and other predominantly Roman Catholic countries, as well as general European secularization has changed its religious landscape. As a result, three times as many Roman Catholics as Protestants lived in the city in 2000, while a large number of residents were members of neither group. Geneva forms part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Lausanne, Geneva and Fribourg. The World Council of Churches and the Lutheran World Federation both have their headquarters at the Ecumenical Centre in Grand-Saconnex, Geneva. The World Communion of Reformed Churches, a worldwide organization of Presbyterian, Continental Reformed, Congregational and other Reformed churches gathering more than 80 million people around the world was based here from 1948 until 2013. The Executive Committee of the World Communion of Reformed Churches voted in 2012 to move its offices to Hanover, Germany, citing the high costs of running the ecumenical organization in Geneva, Switzerland. The move was completed in 2013. Likewise, the Conference of European Churches have moved their headquarters from Geneva to Brussels. ""Protestant Rome""[edit] Reformation Wall in Geneva; from left to right: William Farel, John Calvin, Theodore Beza, and John Knox Prior to the Protestant Reformation the city was de jure and de facto Roman Catholic. Reaction to the new movement varied across Switzerland. John Calvin went to Geneva in 1536 after William Farel encouraged him to do so. In Geneva, the Catholic bishop had been obliged to seek exile in 1532. Geneva became a stronghold of Calvinism. Some of the tenets created there influenced Protestantism as a whole. St. Pierre Cathedral was where Calvin and his Protestant reformers preached. It constituted the epicentre of the newly developing Protestant thought that would later become known as the Reformed tradition. Many prominent Reformed theologians operated there, including William Farel and Theodore Beza, Calvin's successor who progressed Reformed thought after his death. Geneva was a shelter for Calvinists, but at the same time it persecuted Roman Catholics and others considered heretics. The case of Michael Servetus, an early Nontrinitarian, is notable. Condemned by Catholics and Protestants alike, he was arrested in Geneva and burnt at the stake as a heretic by order of the city's Protestant governing council. John Calvin and his followers denounced him, and possibly contributed to his sentence. In 1802, during its annexation to France under Napoleon I, the Diocese of Geneva was united with the Diocese of Chambéry, but the 1814 Congress of Vienna and the 1816 Treaty of Turin stipulated that in the territories transferred to a now considerably extended Geneva, the Catholic religion was to be protected and that no changes were to be made in existing conditions without an agreement with the Holy See.[24] Napoleon's common policy was to emancipate Catholics in Protestant-majority areas, and the other way around, as well as emancipating Jews. In 1819, the city of Geneva and 20 parishes were united to the Diocese of Lausanne by Pope Pius VII and in 1822, the non-Swiss territory was made into the Diocese of Annecy. A variety of concord with the civil authorities came as a result of the separation of church and state, enacted with strong Catholic support in 1907.[24] Crime[edit] See also: Crime in Switzerland In 2014 the incidence of crimes listed in the Swiss Criminal Code in Geneva was 143.9 per thousand residents. During the same period the rate of drug crimes was 33.6 per thousand residents. The rate of violations of immigration, visa and work permit laws was 35.7 per thousand residents.[58] Cityscape[edit] View of Geneva to the south. Mont Salève (in France) dominates the foreground, with the white summit of Mont Blanc just visible behind it and 70 km (43 mi) away to the southeast. To the left of Mont Blanc is the point of Le Môle. View of Geneva from the Salève.

Le Courrier mainly focuses on Geneva. Both Le Temps (headquartered in Geneva) and Le Matin are widely read in Geneva, but cover the whole of Romandy. Geneva is the main media center for French-speaking Switzerland. It is the headquarters for the numerous French language radio and television networks of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation, known collectively as Radio Télévision Suisse. While both networks cover the whole of Romandy, special programs related to Geneva are sometimes broadcast on some of the local radio frequencies. Other local radio stations broadcast from the city, including YesFM (FM 91.8 MHz), Radio Cité (non-commercial radio, FM 92.2 MHz), OneFM (FM 107.0 MHz, also broadcast in Vaud), and World Radio Switzerland (FM 88.4 MHz). Léman Bleu is a local TV channel, founded in 1996 and distributed by cable. Due to the proximity to France, many French television channels are also available. Traditions and customs[edit] Geneva observes Jeûne genevois on the first Thursday following the first Sunday in September. By local tradition, this commemorates the date news of the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of Huguenots reached Geneva. Geneva celebrates L'Escalade on the weekend nearest 12 December, celebrating the defeat of the surprise attack of troops sent by Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy during the night of 11–12 December 1602. Festive traditions include chocolate cauldrons filled with vegetable-shaped marzipan treats and the Escalade procession on horseback in seventeenth century armour. Geneva has also been organizing a 'Course de l'Escalade', which means 'Climbing Race'. This race takes place in Geneva's Old Town, and has been popular across all ages. Non-competitive racers dress up in fancy costumes, while walking in the race. Since 1818, a particular chestnut tree has been used as the official ""herald of the spring"" in Geneva. The sautier (secretary of the Parliament of the Canton of Geneva) observes the tree and notes the day of arrival of the first bud. While this event has no practical effect, the sautier issues a formal press release and the local newspaper will usually mention the news.[60] As this is one of the world's oldest records of a plant's reaction to climatic conditions, researchers have been interested to note that the first bud has been appearing earlier and earlier in the year. During the 19th century many dates were in March or April. In recent years, they have usually been in late February (sometimes earlier).[61] In 2002, the first bud appeared unusually early, on 7 February, and then again on 29 December of the same year. The following year, one of the hottest years recorded in Europe, was a year with no bud. In 2008, the first bud also appeared early, on 19 February. Music and festivals[edit] Fireworks at the Fêtes de Genève, 2012 The opera house, the Grand Théâtre de Genève, which officially opened in 1876, was partly destroyed by a fire in 1951 and reopened in 1962. It has the largest stage in Switzerland. It features opera and dance performances, recitals, concerts and, occasionally, theatre. The Victoria Hall is used for classical music concerts. It is the home of the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande. Every summer the Fêtes de Genève (Geneva Festival) are organised in Geneva. According to Radio Télévision Suisse in 2013 hundreds of thousands of people came to Geneva to see the annual hour-long grand firework display of the Fêtes de Genève.[62] An annual music festival takes place in June. Groups of artists perform in different parts of the city. In 2016 the festival celebrated its 25th anniversary.[63] Further annual festivals are the Fête de l'Olivier, a festival of Arabic music, organized by the ICAM since 1980,[64] and the Genevan Brass Festival, founded by Christophe Sturzenegger in 2010.[65] Education[edit] Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies The Canton of Geneva's public school system has écoles primaires (ages 4–12) and cycles d'orientation (ages 12–15). Students can leave school at 15, but secondary education is provided by collèges (ages 15–19), the oldest of which is the Collège Calvin, which could be considered one of the oldest public schools in the world,[62][66] écoles de culture générale (15–18/19) and the écoles professionnelles (15–18/19). The écoles professionnelles offer full-time courses and part-time study as part of an apprenticeship. Geneva also has a number of private schools.[67] In 2011 89,244 (37.0%) of the population had completed non-mandatory upper secondary education, and 107,060 or (44.3%) had completed additional higher education (either university or a Fachhochschule). Of the 107,060 who completed tertiary schooling, 32.5% were Swiss men, 31.6% were Swiss women, 18.1% were non-Swiss men and 17.8% were non-Swiss women. During the 2011–2012 school year, there were a total of 92,311 students in the Geneva school system (primary to university). The education system in the Canton of Geneva has eight years of primary school, with 32,716 students. The secondary school program consists of three lower, obligatory years of schooling, followed by three to five years of optional, advanced study. There were 13,146 lower-secondary students who attended schools in Geneva. There were 10,486 upper-secondary students from the municipality along with 10,330 students who were in a professional, non-university track program. An additional 11,797 students were attending private schools.[68] The University of Geneva. Geneva is home to the University of Geneva where approximately 16,500 students are regularly enrolled.[69] In 1559 John Calvin founded the Geneva Academy, a theological and humanist seminary. In the 19th century the Academy lost its ecclesiastic links and in 1873, with the addition of a medical faculty, it became the University of Geneva. In 2011 it was ranked 35th European university.[70] The Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies was among the first academic institutions in the World to teach international relations. It is one of Europe's most prestigious institutions, offering MA and PhD programmes in law, political science, history, economics, international affairs, and development studies. The oldest international school in the world is the International School of Geneva, founded in 1924 along with the League of Nations. The Geneva School of Diplomacy and International Relations is a private university in the grounds of the Château de Penthes. CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research) is probably the best known of Geneva's educational and research facilities, most recently for the Large Hadron Collider. Founded in 1954, CERN was one of Europe's first joint ventures and has developed as the world's largest particle physics laboratory. Physicists from around the world travel to CERN to research matter and explore the fundamental forces and materials that form the universe. Geneva is home to five major libraries, the Bibliothèques municipales Genève, the Haute école de travail social, Institut d'études sociales, the Haute école de santé, the Ecole d'ingénieurs de Genève and the Haute école d'art et de design. There were (as of 2008[update]) 877,680 books or other media in the libraries, and in the same year 1,798,980 items were loaned.[71] Economy[edit] Geneva's economy is largely service-driven and closely linked to the rest of the canton. The city is often ranked as one of the strongest global financial centres, ranking 9th in the world in 2020[72] and 2nd in Europe behind London. Three main sectors dominate the financial sector: commodity trading; trade finance, and wealth management. Around a third of the world's free traded oil, sugar, grains and oil seeds is traded in Geneva. Approximately 22% of the world's cotton is traded in the Lake Geneva region. Other major commodities traded in the canton include steel, electricity, or coffee.[73] Large trading companies have their regional or global headquarters in the canton, such as Bunge, Cargill, Vitol, Gunvor, BNP Paribas, or Mercuria Energy Group, in addition to being home to the world's second largest shipping company, Mediterranean Shipping Company. Commodity trading is sustained by a strong trade finance sector, with large banks such as BCGE, BCP, BNP Paribas, BCV, Crédit Agricole, Credit Suisse, ING, Société Générale, and UBS, all having their headquarters in the area for this business. Wealth management is dominated by private banks, particularly Pictet, Lombard Odier, Edmond de Rothschild Group, Union Bancaire Privée, Mirabaud Group, Dukascopy Bank, Bordier & Cie, Banque SYZ, or REYL & Cie. In addition, the canton is home to the largest concentration of foreign-owned banks in Switzerland, such as HSBC Private Bank, JPMorgan Chase, or Arab Bank. Behind the financial sector, the next largest major economic sector is watchmaking, dominated by luxury firms Rolex, Richemont, Patek Philippe, Piaget, Roger Dubuis, and others, whose factories are concentrated in the Les Acacias neighbourhood, as well as the neighbouring municipalities of Plan-les-Ouates, Satigny, and Meyrin. Trade finance, wealth management, and watchmaking, approximately contribute two thirds of the corporate tax paid in the canton[74] Other large multinationals are also headquartered in the city and canton, such as Firmenich (in Satigny), and Givaudan (in Vernier), the world's two largest manufacturers of flavours, fragrances and active cosmetic ingredients; SGS, the world's largest inspection, verification, testing and certification services company; Temenos, a large banking software provider; or the local headquarters for Procter & Gamble, Japan Tobacco International, or L'Oréal (in Vernier). Although they do not directly contribute to the local economy, the city of Geneva is also host to the world's largest concentration of international organisations and UN agencies, such as the Red Cross, the World Health Organization, the World Trade Organization, the International Telecommunication Union, the World Intellectual Property Organization, the World Meteorological Organization, and the International Labour Organization, as well as the European headquarters of the United Nations. Its international mindedness, well-connected airport, and centrality in the continent, also make Geneva a good destination for congresses and trade fairs, of which the largest is the Geneva Motor Show held in Palexpo. Agriculture is commonplace in the hinterlands of Geneva, particularly wheat and wine. Despite its relatively small size, the canton produces around 10% of the Swiss wine and has the highest vineyard density in the country.[75] The largest strains grown in Geneva are gamay, chasselas, pinot noir, gamaret, and chardonnay. As of  2019[update], Geneva had an unemployment rate of 3.9%.[76] As of 2008[update], there were five[clarification needed] people employed in the primary economic sector and about three[clarification needed] businesses involved in this sector. 9,783 people were employed in the secondary sector and there were 1,200 businesses in this sector. 134,429 people were employed in the tertiary sector, with 12,489 businesses in this sector.[49] There were 91,880 residents of the municipality who were employed in some capacity, with women making up 47.7% of the workforce. In 2008[update], the total number of full-time equivalent jobs was 124,185. The number of jobs in the primary sector was four, all of which were in agriculture. The number of jobs in the secondary sector was 9,363 of which 4,863 or (51.9%) were in manufacturing and 4,451 (47.5%) were in construction. The number of jobs in the tertiary sector was 114,818. In the tertiary sector; 16,573 or 14.4% were in wholesale or retail sales or the repair of motor vehicles, 3,474 or 3.0% were in the movement and storage of goods, 9,484 or 8.3% were in a hotel or restaurant, 4,544 or 4.0% were in the information industry, 20,982 or 18.3% were the insurance or financial industry, 12,177 or 10.6% were technical professionals or scientists, 10,007 or 8.7% were in education and 15,029 or 13.1% were in health care.[77] In 2000[update], there were 95,190 workers who commuted into the municipality and 25,920 workers who commuted away. The municipality is a net importer of workers, with about 3.7 workers entering the municipality for every one leaving. About 13.8% of the workforce coming into Geneva are coming from outside Switzerland, while 0.4% of the locals commute out of Switzerland for work.[78] Of the working population, 38.2% used public transportation to get to work, and 30.6% used a private car.[49] Sport[edit] Ice hockey is the most popular sport in Geneva.[79] Geneva is home to Genève-Servette HC, which plays in the National League. They play their home games in the 7,135-seat Patinoire des Vernets. In 2008 and 2010 the team made it to the league finals but lost to the ZSC Lions and SC Bern respectively.[80] The team is by far the most popular one in both the city and the canton of Geneva, drawing three times more spectators than the football team in 2017.[81][82] The town is home to Servette FC, a football club founded in 1890 and named after a borough on the right bank of the Rhône. The home of Servette FC is the 30,000-seat Stade de Genève. Servette FC plays in the Raiffeisen Super League. Urania Genève Sport also play in the city. Geneva is home to the basketball team Lions de Genève, 2013 and 2015 champions of the Swiss Basketball League. The team plays its home games in the Pavilion des Sports. Geneva Jets Australian Football Club have been playing Australian Football in the AFL Switzerland league since 2019. Infrastructure[edit] Transportation[edit] This section needs to be updated. Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (July 2020) Main article: Transports Publics Genevois Geneva railway station TCMC (Tramway Cornavin – Meyrin – CERN) The city is served by the Geneva Cointrin International Airport. It is connected by Geneva Airport railway station (French: Gare de Genève-Aéroport) to both the Swiss Federal Railways network and the French SNCF network, including links to Paris, Lyon, Marseille and Montpellier by TGV. Geneva is connected to the motorway systems of both Switzerland (A1 motorway) and France. Public transport by bus, trolleybus or tram is provided by Transports Publics Genevois. In addition to an extensive coverage of the city centre, the network extends to most of the municipalities of the Canton, with a few lines reaching into France. Public transport by boat is provided by the Mouettes Genevoises, which link the two banks of the lake within the city, and by the Compagnie Générale de Navigation sur le lac Léman which serves more distant destinations such as Nyon, Yvoire, Thonon, Évian, Lausanne and Montreux using both modern diesel vessels and vintage paddle steamers. Geneva Sécheron railway station Trains operated by Swiss Federal Railways connect the airport to the main station of Cornavin in six minutes. Regional train services are being developed towards Coppet and Bellegarde. At the city limits two new railway stations have been opened since 2002: Genève-Sécheron (close to the UN and the Botanical Gardens) and Lancy-Pont-Rouge. In 2011 work started on the CEVA rail (Cornavin – Eaux-Vives – Annemasse) project, first planned in 1884, which will connect Cornavin with the Cantonal hospital, Eaux-Vives railway station and Annemasse, in France. The link between the main railway station and the classification yard of La Praille already exists; from there, the line runs mostly underground to the Hospital and Eaux-Vives, where it links to the existing line to France. The line fully opened in December 2019, as part of the Léman Express regional rail network. TOSA Bus at PALEXPO Flash bus stops In May 2013, the demonstrator electric bus system[83] with a capacity of 133 passengers commenced between Geneva Airport and Palexpo. The project aims to introduce a new system of mass transport with electric ""flash"" recharging of the buses at selected stops while passengers are disembarking and embarking.[84] Taxis in Geneva can be difficult to find, and may need to be booked in advance, especially in the early morning or at peak hours. Taxis can refuse to take babies and children because of seating legislation.[85] An ambitious project to close 200 streets in the centre of Geneva to cars was approved by the Geneva cantonal authorities in 2010 and was planned to be implemented over a span of four years (2010–2014), though as of 2018[update], work on the project has yet to be started.[86] Utilities[edit] Water, natural gas and electricity are provided to the municipalities of the Canton of Geneva by the state-owned Services Industriels de Genève, known as SIG. Most of the drinking water (80%) is extracted from the lake; the remaining 20% is provided by groundwater, originally formed by infiltration from the Arve. 30% of the Canton's electricity needs is locally produced, mainly by three hydroelectric dams on the Rhône (Seujet, Verbois and Chancy-Pougny). In addition, 13% of the electricity produced in the Canton is from the burning of waste at the waste incineration facility of Les Cheneviers. The remaining needs (57%) are covered by imports from other cantons in Switzerland or other European countries; SIG buys only electricity produced by renewable methods, and in particular does not use electricity produced using nuclear reactors or fossil fuels. Natural gas is available in the City of Geneva, as well as in about two-thirds of the municipalities of the canton, and is imported from Western Europe by the Swiss company Gaznat. SIG also provides telecommunication facilities to carriers, service providers and large enterprises. From 2003 to 2005, ""Voisin, voisine"" a fibre to the Home pilot project with a triple play offering was launched to test the end-user market in the Charmilles district. International organisations[edit] See also: List of international organizations based in Geneva The World Intellectual Property Organization. The assembly hall of the Palace of Nations. Geneva is the European headquarters of the United Nations, in the Palace of Nations building, which was also the headquarters of the former League of Nations. Several agencies are headquartered at Geneva, including the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the World Health Organization, the International Labour Organization, International Telecommunication Union, the International Baccalaureate Organization and the World Intellectual Property Organization. Apart from the UN agencies, Geneva hosts many inter-governmental organizations, such as the World Trade Organization, the South Centre, the World Meteorological Organization, the World Economic Forum, the International Organization for Migration, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the International Committee of the Red Cross. The Maison de la Paix building hosts the three Geneva centres supported by the Swiss Confederation: the International Centre for Humanitarian Demining, the Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces and the Geneva Centre for Security Policy, as well as other organisations active in the field of peace, international affairs and sustainable development.[87] Organizations on the European level include the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research) which is the world's largest particle physics laboratory. The Geneva Environment Network (GEN) publishes the Geneva Green Guide,[88] an extensive listing of Geneva-based global organisations working on environment protection and sustainable development. A website,[89] jointly run by the Swiss Government, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, the United Nations Environment Programme and the International Union for Conservation of Nature, includes accounts of how NGOs, business, government and the UN cooperate. By doing so, it attempts to explain why Geneva has been picked by so many NGOs and UN bodies as their headquarters' location. The World Organization of the Scout Movement and the World Scout Bureau Central Office are headquartered in Geneva.

It is geographically divided among the Swiss Plateau, the Alps and the Jura, spanning a total area of 41,285 km2 (15,940 sq mi) and land area of 39,997 km2 (15,443 sq mi). Although the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately 8.5 million is concentrated mostly on the plateau, where the largest cities and economic centres are located, among them Zürich, Geneva and Basel. These cities are home to several offices of international organisations such as the WTO, the WHO, the ILO, the headquarters of FIFA, the UN's second-largest office, as well as the main building of the Bank for International Settlements. The main international airports of Switzerland are also located in these cities. The establishment of the Old Swiss Confederacy dates to the late medieval period, resulting from a series of military successes against Austria and Burgundy. Swiss independence from the Holy Roman Empire was formally recognised in the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. The Federal Charter of 1291 is considered the founding document of Switzerland which is celebrated on Swiss National Day. Since the Reformation of the 16th century, Switzerland has maintained a strong policy of armed neutrality; it has not fought an international war since 1815 and did not join the United Nations until 2002. Nevertheless, it pursues an active foreign policy and is frequently involved in peace-building processes around the world.[15] Switzerland is the birthplace of the Red Cross, one of the world's oldest and best known humanitarian organisations. It is a founding member of the European Free Trade Association, but notably not part of the European Union, the European Economic Area or the Eurozone. However, it participates in the Schengen Area and the European Single Market through bilateral treaties. Switzerland occupies the crossroads of Germanic and Romance Europe, as reflected in its four main linguistic and cultural regions: German, French, Italian and Romansh. Although the majority of the population are German-speaking, Swiss national identity is rooted in a common historical background, shared values such as federalism and direct democracy,[16] as well as Alpine symbolism.[17][18] Due to its linguistic diversity, Switzerland is known by a variety of native names: Schweiz [ˈʃvaɪts] (German);[note 5] Suisse [sɥis(ə)] (French); Svizzera [ˈzvittsera] (Italian); and Svizra [ˈʒviːtsrɐ, ˈʒviːtsʁɐ] (Romansh).[note 6] On coins and stamps, the Latin name, Confoederatio Helvetica – frequently shortened to ""Helvetia"" – is used instead of the four national languages. A developed country, it has the highest nominal wealth per adult[19] and the eighth-highest per capita gross domestic product; it has been considered a tax haven.[20][21] It ranks highly on some international metrics, including economic competitiveness and human development. Its cities such as Zürich, Geneva and Basel rank among the highest in the world in terms of quality of life,[22][23] albeit with some of the highest costs of living in the world.[24] In 2020, IMD placed Switzerland first in attracting skilled workers.[25] The WEF ranks it the fifth most competitive country globally.[26] Contents 1 Etymology 2 History 2.1 Early history 2.2 Old Swiss Confederacy 2.3 Napoleonic era 2.4 Federal state 2.5 Modern history 3 Geography 3.1 Climate 3.2 Environment 4 Politics 4.1 Direct democracy 4.2 Cantons 4.2.1 Municipalities 4.3 Foreign relations and international institutions 4.4 Military 4.5 The capital or Federal City issue 5 Economy and labour law 5.1 Taxation and government spending 5.2 Labour market 5.3 Education and science 5.4 Switzerland and the European Union 5.5 Energy, infrastructure and environment 6 Demographics 6.1 Languages 6.2 Health 6.3 Urbanisation 6.3.1 Largest cities 6.4 Religion 7 Culture 7.1 Literature 7.2 Media 7.3 Sports 7.4 Cuisine 8 See also 9 Notes and references 9.1 Notes 9.2 References 10 Bibliography 11 External links Etymology Main article: Name of Switzerland The English name Switzerland is a compound containing Switzer, an obsolete term for the Swiss, which was in use during the 16th to 19th centuries.[27] The English adjective Swiss is a loan from French Suisse, also in use since the 16th century. The name Switzer is from the Alemannic Schwiizer, in origin an inhabitant of Schwyz and its associated territory, one of the Waldstätte cantons which formed the nucleus of the Old Swiss Confederacy. The Swiss began to adopt the name for themselves after the Swabian War of 1499, used alongside the term for ""Confederates"", Eidgenossen (literally: comrades by oath), used since the 14th century. The data code for Switzerland, CH, is derived from Latin Confoederatio Helvetica (English: Helvetic Confederation). The toponym Schwyz itself was first attested in 972, as Old High German Suittes, ultimately perhaps related to swedan ‘to burn’ (cf. Old Norse svíða ‘to singe, burn’), referring to the area of forest that was burned and cleared to build.[28] The name was extended to the area dominated by the canton, and after the Swabian War of 1499 gradually came to be used for the entire Confederation.[29][30] The Swiss German name of the country, Schwiiz, is homophonous to that of the canton and the settlement, but distinguished by the use of the definite article (d'Schwiiz for the Confederation,[31] but simply Schwyz for the canton and the town).[32] The long [iː] of Swiss German is historically and still often today spelled ⟨y⟩ rather than ⟨ii⟩, preserving the original identity of the two names even in writing. The Latin name Confoederatio Helvetica was neologized and introduced gradually after the formation of the federal state in 1848, harking back to the Napoleonic Helvetic Republic, appearing on coins from 1879, inscribed on the Federal Palace in 1902 and after 1948 used in the official seal[33] (e.g., the ISO banking code ""CHF"" for the Swiss franc, and the country top-level domain "".ch"", are both taken from the state's Latin name). Helvetica is derived from the Helvetii, a Gaulish tribe living on the Swiss plateau before the Roman era. Helvetia appears as a national personification of the Swiss confederacy in the 17th century with a 1672 play by Johann Caspar Weissenbach.[34] History Main article: History of Switzerland Switzerland has existed as a state in its present form since the adoption of the Swiss Federal Constitution in 1848. The precursors of Switzerland established a protective alliance at the end of the 13th century (1291), forming a loose confederation of states which persisted for centuries. Early history Main articles: Early history of Switzerland and Switzerland in the Roman era The oldest traces of hominid existence in Switzerland date back about 150,000 years.[35] The oldest known farming settlements in Switzerland, which were found at Gächlingen, have been dated to around 5300 BC.[35] Founded in 44 BC by Lucius Munatius Plancus, Augusta Raurica (near Basel) was the first Roman settlement on the Rhine and is now among the most important archaeological sites in Switzerland.[36] The earliest known cultural tribes of the area were members of the Hallstatt and La Tène cultures, named after the archaeological site of La Tène on the north side of Lake Neuchâtel. La Tène culture developed and flourished during the late Iron Age from around 450 BC,[35] possibly under some influence from the Greek and Etruscan civilisations. One of the most important tribal groups in the Swiss region was the Helvetii. Steadily harassed by the Germanic tribes, in 58 BC the Helvetii decided to abandon the Swiss plateau and migrate to western Gallia, but Julius Caesar's armies pursued and defeated them at the Battle of Bibracte, in today's eastern France, forcing the tribe to move back to its original homeland.[35] In 15 BC, Tiberius, who would one day become the second Roman emperor, and his brother Drusus, conquered the Alps, integrating them into the Roman Empire. The area occupied by the Helvetii—the namesakes of the later Confoederatio Helvetica—first became part of Rome's Gallia Belgica province and then of its Germania Superior province, while the eastern portion of modern Switzerland was integrated into the Roman province of Raetia. Sometime around the start of the Common Era, the Romans maintained a large legionary camp called Vindonissa, now a ruin at the confluence of the Aare and Reuss rivers, near the town of Windisch, an outskirt of Brugg. The first and second century AD was an age of prosperity for the population living on the Swiss plateau. Several towns, like Aventicum, Iulia Equestris and Augusta Raurica, reached a remarkable size, while hundreds of agricultural estates (Villae rusticae) were founded in the countryside. Around 260 AD, the fall of the Agri Decumates territory north of the Rhine transformed today's Switzerland into a frontier land of the Empire. Repeated raids by the Alamanni tribes provoked the ruin of the Roman towns and economy, forcing the population to find shelter near Roman fortresses, like the Castrum Rauracense near Augusta Raurica. The Empire built another line of defence at the north border (the so-called Donau-Iller-Rhine-Limes), but at the end of the fourth century the increased Germanic pressure forced the Romans to abandon the linear defence concept, and the Swiss plateau was finally open to the settlement of Germanic tribes. In the Early Middle Ages, from the end of the 4th century, the western extent of modern-day Switzerland was part of the territory of the Kings of the Burgundians. The Alemanni settled the Swiss plateau in the 5th century and the valleys of the Alps in the 8th century, forming Alemannia. Modern-day Switzerland was therefore then divided between the kingdoms of Alemannia and Burgundy.[35] The entire region became part of the expanding Frankish Empire in the 6th century, following Clovis I's victory over the Alemanni at Tolbiac in 504 AD, and later Frankish domination of the Burgundians.[37][38] Throughout the rest of the 6th, 7th and 8th centuries the Swiss regions continued under Frankish hegemony (Merovingian and Carolingian dynasties). But after its extension under Charlemagne, the Frankish Empire was divided by the Treaty of Verdun in 843.[35] The territories of present-day Switzerland became divided into Middle Francia and East Francia until they were reunified under the Holy Roman Empire around 1000 AD.[35] By 1200, the Swiss plateau comprised the dominions of the houses of Savoy, Zähringer, Habsburg, and Kyburg.[35] Some regions (Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden, later known as Waldstätten) were accorded the Imperial immediacy to grant the empire direct control over the mountain passes. With the extinction of its male line in 1263, the Kyburg dynasty fell in AD 1264; then the Habsburgs under King Rudolph I (Holy Roman Emperor in 1273) laid claim to the Kyburg lands and annexed them extending their territory to the eastern Swiss plateau.[37] Old Swiss Confederacy Main article: Old Swiss Confederacy Further information: Growth of the Old Swiss Confederacy, Reformation in Switzerland, and Early Modern Switzerland The Old Swiss Confederacy from 1291 (dark green) to the sixteenth century (light green) and its associates (blue). In the other colours shown are the subject territories. The Old Swiss Confederacy was an alliance among the valley communities of the central Alps. The Confederacy, governed by nobles and patricians of various cantons, facilitated management of common interests and ensured peace on the important mountain trade routes. The Federal Charter of 1291 agreed between the rural communes of Uri, Schwyz, and Unterwalden is considered the confederacy's founding document, even though similar alliances are likely to have existed decades earlier.[39][40] By 1353, the three original cantons had joined with the cantons of Glarus and Zug and the Lucerne, Zürich and Bern city states to form the ""Old Confederacy"" of eight states that existed until the end of the 15th century. The expansion led to increased power and wealth for the confederation.[40] By 1460, the confederates controlled most of the territory south and west of the Rhine to the Alps and the Jura mountains, particularly after victories against the Habsburgs (Battle of Sempach, Battle of Näfels), over Charles the Bold of Burgundy during the 1470s, and the success of the Swiss mercenaries. The Swiss victory in the Swabian War against the Swabian League of Emperor Maximilian I in 1499 amounted to de facto independence within the Holy Roman Empire.[40] In 1501, Basel and Schaffhausen joined the Old Swiss Confederacy. The 1291 Bundesbrief (federal charter) The Old Swiss Confederacy had acquired a reputation of invincibility during these earlier wars, but expansion of the confederation suffered a setback in 1515 with the Swiss defeat in the Battle of Marignano. This ended the so-called ""heroic"" epoch of Swiss history.[40] The success of Zwingli's Reformation in some cantons led to inter-cantonal religious conflicts in 1529 and 1531 (Wars of Kappel). It was not until more than one hundred years after these internal wars that, in 1648, under the Peace of Westphalia, European countries recognised Switzerland's independence from the Holy Roman Empire and its neutrality.[37][38] During the Early Modern period of Swiss history, the growing authoritarianism of the patriciate families combined with a financial crisis in the wake of the Thirty Years' War led to the Swiss peasant war of 1653. In the background to this struggle, the conflict between Catholic and Protestant cantons persisted, erupting in further violence at the First War of Villmergen, in 1656, and the Toggenburg War (or Second War of Villmergen), in 1712.[40] Napoleonic era Main articles: Switzerland in the Napoleonic era, Helvetic Republic, and Act of Mediation The Act of Mediation was Napoleon's attempt at a compromise between the Ancien Régime and a Republic. In 1798, the revolutionary French government invaded Switzerland and imposed a new unified constitution.[40] This centralised the government of the country, effectively abolishing the cantons: moreover, Mülhausen joined France and the Valtellina valley became part of the Cisalpine Republic, separating from Switzerland. The new regime, known as the Helvetic Republic, was highly unpopular. It had been imposed by a foreign invading army and destroyed centuries of tradition, making Switzerland nothing more than a French satellite state. The fierce French suppression of the Nidwalden Revolt in September 1798 was an example of the oppressive presence of the French Army and the local population's resistance to the occupation. When war broke out between France and its rivals, Russian and Austrian forces invaded Switzerland. The Swiss refused to fight alongside the French in the name of the Helvetic Republic. In 1803 Napoleon organised a meeting of the leading Swiss politicians from both sides in Paris. The result was the Act of Mediation which largely restored Swiss autonomy and introduced a Confederation of 19 cantons.[40] Henceforth, much of Swiss politics would concern balancing the cantons' tradition of self-rule with the need for a central government. In 1815 the Congress of Vienna fully re-established Swiss independence and the European powers agreed to permanently recognise Swiss neutrality.[37][38][40] Swiss troops still served foreign governments until 1860 when they fought in the Siege of Gaeta. The treaty also allowed Switzerland to increase its territory, with the admission of the cantons of Valais, Neuchâtel and Geneva. Switzerland's borders have not changed since, except for some minor adjustments.[41] Federal state Main articles: Restoration and Regeneration (Switzerland) and Switzerland as a federal state The first Federal Palace in Bern (1857). One of the three cantons presiding over the Tagsatzung (former legislative and executive council), Bern was chosen as the permanent seat of federal legislative and executive institutions in 1848, in part because of its closeness to the French-speaking area.[1] The restoration of power to the patriciate was only temporary. After a period of unrest with repeated violent clashes, such as the Züriputsch of 1839, civil war (the Sonderbundskrieg) broke out in 1847 when some Catholic cantons tried to set up a separate alliance (the Sonderbund).[40] The war lasted for less than a month, causing fewer than 100 casualties, most of which were through friendly fire. Yet however minor the Sonderbundskrieg appears compared with other European riots and wars in the 19th century, it nevertheless had a major impact on both the psychology and the society of the Swiss and of Switzerland. The war convinced most Swiss of the need for unity and strength towards its European neighbours. Swiss people from all strata of society, whether Catholic or Protestant, from the liberal or conservative current, realised that the cantons would profit more if their economic and religious interests were merged. Thus, while the rest of Europe saw revolutionary uprisings, the Swiss drew up a constitution which provided for a federal layout, much of it inspired by the American example. This constitution provided for a central authority while leaving the cantons the right to self-government on local issues. Giving credit to those who favoured the power of the cantons (the Sonderbund Kantone), the national assembly was divided between an upper house (the Council of States, two representatives per canton) and a lower house (the National Council, with representatives elected from across the country). Referendums were made mandatory for any amendment of this constitution.[38] This new constitution also brought a legal end to nobility in Switzerland.[42] Inauguration in 1882 of the Gotthard Rail Tunnel connecting the southern canton of Ticino, the longest in the world at the time A system of single weights and measures was introduced and in 1850 the Swiss franc became the Swiss single currency, complemented by the WIR franc in 1934.[43] Article 11 of the constitution forbade sending troops to serve abroad, marking the end of foreign service. It came with the exception of serving the Holy See, and the Swiss were still obliged to serve Francis II of the Two Sicilies with Swiss Guards present at the Siege of Gaeta in 1860. An important clause of the constitution was that it could be re-written completely if this was deemed necessary, thus enabling it to evolve as a whole rather than being modified one amendment at a time.[44] This need soon proved itself when the rise in population and the Industrial Revolution that followed led to calls to modify the constitution accordingly. An early draft was rejected by the population in 1872 but modifications led to its acceptance in 1874.[40] It introduced the facultative referendum for laws at the federal level. It also established federal responsibility for defence, trade, and legal matters. In 1891, the constitution was revised with unusually strong elements of direct democracy, which remain unique even today.[40] Modern history Main articles: Switzerland during the World Wars and Modern history of Switzerland General Ulrich Wille, appointed commander-in-chief of the Swiss Army for the duration of World War I Switzerland was not invaded during either of the world wars. During World War I, Switzerland was home to the revolutionary and founder of the Soviet Union Vladimir Illych Ulyanov (Vladimir Lenin) and he remained there until 1917.[45] Swiss neutrality was seriously questioned by the Grimm–Hoffmann affair in 1917, but that was short-lived. In 1920, Switzerland joined the League of Nations, which was based in Geneva, on condition that it was exempt from any military requirements. During World War II, detailed invasion plans were drawn up by the Germans,[46] but Switzerland was never attacked.[40] Switzerland was able to remain independent through a combination of military deterrence, concessions to Germany, and good fortune as larger events during the war delayed an invasion.[38][47] Under General Henri Guisan, appointed the commander-in-chief for the duration of the war, a general mobilisation of the armed forces was ordered. The Swiss military strategy was changed from one of static defence at the borders to protect the economic heartland, to one of organised long-term attrition and withdrawal to strong, well-stockpiled positions high in the Alps known as the Reduit. Switzerland was an important base for espionage by both sides in the conflict and often mediated communications between the Axis and Allied powers.[47] Switzerland's trade was blockaded by both the Allies and by the Axis. Economic cooperation and extension of credit to the Third Reich varied according to the perceived likelihood of invasion and the availability of other trading partners. Concessions reached a peak after a crucial rail link through Vichy France was severed in 1942, leaving Switzerland (together with Liechtenstein) entirely isolated from the wider world by Axis controlled territory. Over the course of the war, Switzerland interned over 300,000 refugees[48] and the International Red Cross, based in Geneva, played an important part during the conflict. Strict immigration and asylum policies as well as the financial relationships with Nazi Germany raised controversy, but not until the end of the 20th century.[49] During the war, the Swiss Air Force engaged aircraft of both sides, shooting down 11 intruding Luftwaffe planes in May and June 1940, then forcing down other intruders after a change of policy following threats from Germany. Over 100 Allied bombers and their crews were interned during the war. Between 1940 and 1945, Switzerland was bombed by the Allies causing fatalities and property damage.[47] Among the cities and towns bombed were Basel, Brusio, Chiasso, Cornol, Geneva, Koblenz, Niederweningen, Rafz, Renens, Samedan, Schaffhausen, Stein am Rhein, Tägerwilen, Thayngen, Vals, and Zürich. Allied forces explained the bombings, which violated the 96th Article of War, resulted from navigation errors, equipment failure, weather conditions, and errors made by bomber pilots. The Swiss expressed fear and concern that the bombings were intended to put pressure on Switzerland to end economic cooperation and neutrality with Nazi Germany.[50] Court-martial proceedings took place in England and the U.S. Government paid 62,176,433.06 in Swiss francs for reparations of the bombings. Switzerland's attitude towards refugees was complicated and controversial; over the course of the war it admitted as many as 300,000 refugees[48] while refusing tens of thousands more,[51] including Jews who were severely persecuted by the Nazis. After the war, the Swiss government exported credits through the charitable fund known as the Schweizerspende and also donated to the Marshall Plan to help Europe's recovery, efforts that ultimately benefited the Swiss economy.[52] During the Cold War, Swiss authorities considered the construction of a Swiss nuclear bomb.[53] Leading nuclear physicists at the Federal Institute of Technology Zürich such as Paul Scherrer made this a realistic possibility. In 1988, the Paul Scherrer Institute was founded in his name to explore the therapeutic uses of neutron scattering technologies. Financial problems with the defence budget and ethical considerations prevented the substantial funds from being allocated, and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1968 was seen as a valid alternative. All remaining plans for building nuclear weapons were dropped by 1988.[54] In 2003, by granting the Swiss People's Party a second seat in the governing cabinet, the Parliament altered the coalition that had dominated Swiss politics since 1959. Switzerland was the last Western republic to grant women the right to vote. Some Swiss cantons approved this in 1959, while at the federal level it was achieved in 1971[40][55] and, after resistance, in the last canton Appenzell Innerrhoden (one of only two remaining Landsgemeinde, along with Glarus) in 1990. After obtaining suffrage at the federal level, women quickly rose in political significance, with the first woman on the seven-member Federal Council executive being Elisabeth Kopp, who served from 1984 to 1989,[40] and the first female president being Ruth Dreifuss in 1999. Switzerland joined the Council of Europe in 1963.[38] In 1979 areas from the canton of Bern attained independence from the Bernese, forming the new canton of Jura. On 18 April 1999 the Swiss population and the cantons voted in favour of a completely revised federal constitution.[40] In 2002 Switzerland became a full member of the United Nations, leaving the Vatican City as the last widely recognised state without full UN membership. Switzerland is a founding member of the EFTA but is not a member of the European Economic Area. An application for membership in the European Union was sent in May 1992, but not advanced since the EEA was rejected in December 1992[40] when Switzerland was the only country to launch a referendum on the EEA. There have since been several referendums on the EU issue; due to opposition from the citizens, the membership application has been withdrawn. Nonetheless, Swiss law is gradually being adjusted to conform with that of the EU, and the government has signed a number of bilateral agreements with the European Union. Switzerland, together with Liechtenstein, has been completely surrounded by the EU since Austria's entry in 1995. On 5 June 2005, Swiss voters agreed by a 55% majority to join the Schengen treaty, a result that was regarded by EU commentators as a sign of support by Switzerland, a country that is traditionally perceived as independent and reluctant to enter supranational bodies.[38] In September 2020, a referendum calling for a vote on end to the pact that allowed a free movement of people from the European Union was introduced by the Swiss People's Party (SPP).[56] However, the voters rejected the attempts of taking back control of immigration, defeating the motion by a roughly 63%–37% margin.[57] Geography Main article: Geography of Switzerland Physical map of Switzerland (in German) Extending across the north and south side of the Alps in west-central Europe, Switzerland encompasses a great diversity of landscapes and climates on a limited area of 41,285 square kilometres (15,940 sq mi).[58] The population is about 8.7 million (2020 est.).[59] The average population density in 2019 was 215.2 inhabitants per square kilometre (557/sq mi).[60]:79 In the largest canton by area, Graubünden, lying entirely in the Alps, population density falls to 28.0 inhabitants per square kilometre (73/sq mi).[60]:30 In the canton of Zürich, with its large urban capital, the density is 926.8 per square kilometre (2,400/sq mi).[60]:76 Switzerland lies between latitudes 45° and 48° N, and longitudes 5° and 11° E. It contains three basic topographical areas: the Swiss Alps to the south, the Swiss Plateau or Central Plateau, and the Jura mountains on the west. The Alps are a high mountain range running across the central-south of the country, constituting about 60% of the country's total area. The majority of the Swiss population live in the Swiss Plateau. Among the high valleys of the Swiss Alps, many glaciers are found, totalling an area of 1,063 square kilometres (410 sq mi). From these originate the headwaters of several major rivers, such as the Rhine, Inn, Ticino and Rhône, which flow in the four cardinal directions into the whole of Europe. The hydrographic network includes several of the largest bodies of freshwater in Central and Western Europe, among which are included Lake Geneva (also called le Lac Léman in French), Lake Constance (known as Bodensee in German) and Lake Maggiore. Switzerland has more than 1500 lakes and contains 6% of Europe's stock of fresh water. Lakes and glaciers cover about 6% of the national territory. The largest lake is Lake Geneva, in western Switzerland shared with France. The Rhône is both the main source and outflow of Lake Geneva. Lake Constance is the second-largest Swiss lake and, like Lake Geneva, an intermediate step by the Rhine at the border to Austria and Germany. While the Rhône flows into the Mediterranean Sea at the French Camargue region and the Rhine flows into the North Sea at Rotterdam in the Netherlands, about 1,000 kilometres (620 miles) apart, both springs are only about 22 kilometres (14 miles) apart from each other in the Swiss Alps.[58][61] Contrasted landscapes between the regions of the Matterhorn and Lake Lucerne Forty-eight of Switzerland's mountains are 4,000 metres (13,000 ft) above sea in altitude or higher.[58] At 4,634 m (15,203 ft), Monte Rosa is the highest, although the Matterhorn (4,478 m or 14,692 ft) is often regarded as the most famous. Both are located within the Pennine Alps in the canton of Valais, on the border with Italy. The section of the Bernese Alps above the deep glacial Lauterbrunnen valley, containing 72 waterfalls, is well known for the Jungfrau (4,158 m or 13,642 ft) Eiger and Mönch, and the many picturesque valleys in the region. In the southeast the long Engadin Valley, encompassing the St. Moritz area in canton of Graubünden, is also well known; the highest peak in the neighbouring Bernina Alps is Piz Bernina (4,049 m or 13,284 ft).[58] The more populous northern part of the country, constituting about 30% of the country's total area, is called the Swiss Plateau. It has greater open and hilly landscapes, partly forested, partly open pastures, usually with grazing herds, or vegetables and fruit fields, but it is still hilly. There are large lakes found here and the biggest Swiss cities are in this area of the country.[58] Within Switzerland there are two small enclaves: Büsingen belongs to Germany, Campione d'Italia belongs to Italy.[62] Switzerland has no exclaves in other countries. Climate Köppen-Geiger climate classification map for Switzerland The Swiss climate is generally temperate, but can vary greatly between the localities,[63] from glacial conditions on the mountaintops to the often pleasant near Mediterranean climate at Switzerland's southern tip. There are some valley areas in the southern part of Switzerland where some cold-hardy palm trees are found. Summers tend to be warm and humid at times with periodic rainfall so they are ideal for pastures and grazing. The less humid winters in the mountains may see long intervals of stable conditions for weeks, while the lower lands tend to suffer from inversion, during these periods, thus seeing no sun for weeks. A weather phenomenon known as the föhn (with an identical effect to the chinook wind) can occur at all times of the year and is characterised by an unexpectedly warm wind, bringing air of very low relative humidity to the north of the Alps during rainfall periods on the southern face of the Alps. This works both ways across the alps but is more efficient if blowing from the south due to the steeper step for oncoming wind from the south. Valleys running south to north trigger the best effect. The driest conditions persist in all inner alpine valleys that receive less rain because arriving clouds lose a lot of their content while crossing the mountains before reaching these areas. Large alpine areas such as Graubünden remain drier than pre-alpine areas and as in the main valley of the Valais wine grapes are grown there.[64] The wettest conditions persist in the high Alps and in the Ticino canton which has much sun yet heavy bursts of rain from time to time.[64] Precipitation tends to be spread moderately throughout the year with a peak in summer. Autumn is the driest season, winter receives less precipitation than summer, yet the weather patterns in Switzerland are not in a stable climate system and can be variable from year to year with no strict and predictable periods. Environment Switzerland contains two terrestrial ecoregions: Western European broadleaf forests and Alps conifer and mixed forests.[65] Switzerland's ecosystems can be particularly fragile, because the many delicate valleys separated by high mountains often form unique ecologies. The mountainous regions themselves are also vulnerable, with a rich range of plants not found at other altitudes, and experience some pressure from visitors and grazing. The climatic, geological and topographical conditions of the alpine region make for a very fragile ecosystem that is particularly sensitive to climate change.[63][66] Nevertheless, according to the 2014 Environmental Performance Index, Switzerland ranks first among 132 nations in safeguarding the environment, due to its high scores on environmental public health, its heavy reliance on renewable sources of energy (hydropower and geothermal energy), and its control of greenhouse gas emissions.[67] In 2020 it was ranked third out of 180 countries.[68] The country pledged to cut GHG emissions by 50% by the year 2030 compared to the level of 1990 and works on a plan to reach zero emissions by 2050.[69] However, access to biocapacity in Switzerland is far lower than world average. In 2016, Switzerland had 1.0 global hectares[70] of biocapacity per person within its territory, 40 percent less than world average of 1.6 global hectares per person. In contrast, in 2016, they used 4.6 global hectares of biocapacity - their ecological footprint of consumption. This means they used about 4.6 times as much biocapacity as Switzerland contains. The remainder comes from imports and overusing the global commons (such as the atmosphere through greenhouse gas emissions). As a result, Switzerland is running a biocapacity deficit.[70] Switzerland had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 3.53/10, ranking it 150th globally out of 172 countries.[71] Politics Main article: Politics of Switzerland The Swiss Federal Council in 2016 with President Johann Schneider-Ammann (front, centre)[note 7] The Federal Constitution adopted in 1848 is the legal foundation of the modern federal state.[72] A new Swiss Constitution was adopted in 1999, but did not introduce notable changes to the federal structure. It outlines basic and political rights of individuals and citizen participation in public affairs, divides the powers between the Confederation and the cantons and defines federal jurisdiction and authority. There are three main governing bodies on the federal level:[73] the bicameral parliament (legislative), the Federal Council (executive) and the Federal Court (judicial). The Federal Palace, seat of the Federal Assembly and the Federal Council The Swiss Parliament consists of two houses: the Council of States which has 46 representatives (two from each canton and one from each half-canton) who are elected under a system determined by each canton, and the National Council, which consists of 200 members who are elected under a system of proportional representation, depending on the population of each canton. Members of both houses serve for 4 years and only serve as members of parliament part-time (so-called Milizsystem or citizen legislature).[74] When both houses are in joint session, they are known collectively as the Federal Assembly. Through referendums, citizens may challenge any law passed by parliament and through initiatives, introduce amendments to the federal constitution, thus making Switzerland a direct democracy.[72] The Federal Council constitutes the federal government, directs the federal administration and serves as collective Head of State. It is a collegial body of seven members, elected for a four-year mandate by the Federal Assembly which also exercises oversight over the council. The President of the Confederation is elected by the Assembly from among the seven members, traditionally in rotation and for a one-year term; the President chairs the government and assumes representative functions. However, the president is a primus inter pares with no additional powers, and remains the head of a department within the administration.[72] The Swiss government has been a coalition of the four major political parties since 1959, each party having a number of seats that roughly reflects its share of electorate and representation in the federal parliament. The classic distribution of 2 CVP/PDC, 2 SPS/PSS, 2 FDP/PRD and 1 SVP/UDC as it stood from 1959 to 2003 was known as the ""magic formula"". Following the 2015 Federal Council elections, the seven seats in the Federal Council were distributed as follows: 1 seat for the Christian Democratic People's Party (CVP/PDC), 2 seats for the Free Democratic Party (FDP/PRD), 2 seats for the Social Democratic Party (SPS/PSS), 2 seats for the Swiss People's Party (SVP/UDC). The function of the Federal Supreme Court is to hear appeals against rulings of cantonal or federal courts. The judges are elected by the Federal Assembly for six-year terms.[75] Direct democracy Main article: Voting in Switzerland The Landsgemeinde is an old form of direct democracy, still in practice in two cantons. Direct democracy and federalism are hallmarks of the Swiss political system.[76] Swiss citizens are subject to three legal jurisdictions: the municipality, canton and federal levels. The 1848 and 1999 Swiss Constitutions define a system of direct democracy (sometimes called half-direct or representative direct democracy because it is aided by the more commonplace institutions of a representative democracy). The instruments of this system at the federal level, known as popular rights (German: Volksrechte, French: droits populaires, Italian: diritti popolari),[77] include the right to submit a federal initiative and a referendum, both of which may overturn parliamentary decisions.[72][78] By calling a federal referendum, a group of citizens may challenge a law passed by parliament, if they gather 50,000 signatures against the law within 100 days. If so, a national vote is scheduled where voters decide by a simple majority whether to accept or reject the law. Any 8 cantons together can also call a constitutional referendum on a federal law.[72] Similarly, the federal constitutional initiative allows citizens to put a constitutional amendment to a national vote, if 100,000 voters sign the proposed amendment within 18 months.[note 8] The Federal Council and the Federal Assembly can supplement the proposed amendment with a counter-proposal, and then voters must indicate a preference on the ballot in case both proposals are accepted. Constitutional amendments, whether introduced by initiative or in parliament, must be accepted by a double majority of the national popular vote and the cantonal popular votes.[note 9][76] Cantons Main article: Cantons of Switzerland The Swiss Confederation consists of 26 cantons:[72][79] Canton ID Capital Canton ID Capital Aargau 19 Aarau *Nidwalden 7 Stans *Appenzell Ausserrhoden 15 Herisau *Obwalden 6 Sarnen *Appenzell Innerrhoden 16 Appenzell Schaffhausen 14 Schaffhausen *Basel-Landschaft 13 Liestal Schwyz 5 Schwyz *Basel-Stadt 12 Basel Solothurn 11 Solothurn Bern 2 Bern St. Gallen 17 St. Gallen Fribourg 10 Fribourg Thurgau 20 Frauenfeld Geneva 25 Geneva Ticino 21 Bellinzona Glarus 8 Glarus Uri 4 Altdorf Grisons 18 Chur Valais 23 Sion Jura 26 Delémont Vaud 22 Lausanne Lucerne 3 Lucerne Zug 9 Zug Neuchâtel 24 Neuchâtel Zürich 1 Zürich *These cantons are known as half-cantons. The cantons are federated states, have a permanent constitutional status and, in comparison with the situation in other countries, a high degree of independence. Under the Federal Constitution, all 26 cantons are equal in status, except that 6 (referred to often as the half-cantons) are represented by only one councillor (instead of two) in the Council of States and have only half a cantonal vote with respect to the required cantonal majority in referendums on constitutional amendments. Each canton has its own constitution, and its own parliament, government, police and courts.[79] However, there are considerable differences between the individual cantons, most particularly in terms of population and geographical area. Their populations vary between 16,003 (Appenzell Innerrhoden) and 1,487,969 (Zürich), and their area between 37 km2 (14 sq mi) (Basel-Stadt) and 7,105 km2 (2,743 sq mi) (Grisons). Municipalities Main article: Municipalities of Switzerland The cantons comprise a total of 2,222 municipalities as of 2018. Foreign relations and international institutions Main article: Foreign relations of Switzerland Traditionally, Switzerland avoids alliances that might entail military, political, or direct economic action and has been neutral since the end of its expansion in 1515. Its policy of neutrality was internationally recognised at the Congress of Vienna in 1815.[80][81] Only in 2002 did Switzerland become a full member of the United Nations[80] and it was the first state to join it by referendum. Switzerland maintains diplomatic relations with almost all countries and historically has served as an intermediary between other states.[80] Switzerland is not a member of the European Union; the Swiss people have consistently rejected membership since the early 1990s.[80] However, Switzerland does participate in the Schengen Area.[82] Swiss neutrality has been questioned at times.[83][84][85][86][87] The monochromatically reversed Swiss flag became the symbol of the Red Cross Movement,[55] founded in 1863 by Henry Dunant.[88] Many international institutions have their seats in Switzerland, in part because of its policy of neutrality. Geneva is the birthplace of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, the Geneva Conventions and, since 2006, hosts the United Nations Human Rights Council. Even though Switzerland is one of the most recent countries to have joined the United Nations, the Palace of Nations in Geneva is the second biggest centre for the United Nations after New York, and Switzerland was a founding member and home to the League of Nations. Apart from the United Nations headquarters, the Swiss Confederation is host to many UN agencies, like the World Health Organization (WHO), the International Labour Organization (ILO), the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and about 200 other international organisations, including the World Trade Organization and the World Intellectual Property Organization.[80] The annual meetings of the World Economic Forum in Davos bring together top international business and political leaders from Switzerland and foreign countries to discuss important issues facing the world, including health and the environment. Additionally the headquarters of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) are located in Basel since 1930. Furthermore, many sports federations and organisations are located throughout the country, such as the International Handball Federation in Basel, the International Basketball Federation in Geneva, the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) in Nyon, the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA) and the International Ice Hockey Federation both in Zürich, the International Cycling Union in Aigle, and the International Olympic Committee in Lausanne.[89] Military Main articles: Swiss Armed Forces and Pontifical Swiss Guard A Swiss Air Force F/A-18 Hornet at Axalp Air Show The Swiss Armed Forces, including the Land Forces and the Air Force, are composed mostly of conscripts, male citizens aged from 20 to 34 (in special cases up to 50) years. Being a landlocked country, Switzerland has no navy; however, on lakes bordering neighbouring countries, armed military patrol boats are used. Swiss citizens are prohibited from serving in foreign armies, except for the Swiss Guards of the Vatican, or if they are dual citizens of a foreign country and reside there. The structure of the Swiss militia system stipulates that the soldiers keep their Army issued equipment, including all personal weapons, at home. Some organisations and political parties find this practice controversial.[90] Women can serve voluntarily. Men usually receive military conscription orders for training at the age of 18.[91] About two thirds of the young Swiss are found suited for service; for those found unsuited, various forms of alternative service exist.[92] Annually, approximately 20,000 persons are trained in recruit centres for a duration from 18 to 21 weeks. The reform ""Army XXI"" was adopted by popular vote in 2003, it replaced the previous model ""Army 95"", reducing the effectiveness from 400,000 to about 200,000. Of those, 120,000 are active in periodic Army training and 80,000 are non-training reserves.[93] The newest reform of the military, WEA/DEVA/USEs, started in 2019 and will reduce the number of army personnel progressively to 100,000 by the end of 2022.[94] Swiss-built Mowag Eagles of the Land Forces Overall, three general mobilisations have been declared to ensure the integrity and neutrality of Switzerland. The first one was held on the occasion of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71. The second was in response to the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914. The third mobilisation of the army took place in September 1939 in response to the German attack on Poland; Henri Guisan was elected as the General-in-Chief. Because of its neutrality policy, the Swiss army does not currently take part in armed conflicts in other countries but is part of some peacekeeping missions around the world. Since 2000 the armed force department has also maintained the Onyx intelligence gathering system to monitor satellite communications.[95] Gun politics in Switzerland are unique in Europe in that 2–3.5 million guns are in the hands of civilians, giving the nation an estimate of 27.6–41.2 guns per 100 people.[96] It is worth noting that as per Small Arms Survey, only 324,484 guns are owned by the military on top of the civilian-owned ones,[97] but that only 143,372 are in the hands of soldiers as per Army numbers.[98] However, ammunition is no longer issued.[99][100] The capital or Federal City issue Until 1848 the rather loosely coupled Confederation did not know a central political organisation, but representatives, mayors, and Landammänner met several times a year at the capital of the Lieu presiding the Confederal Diet for one year. The Old City of Bern Until 1500 the legates met most of the time in Lucerne, but also in Zürich, Baden, Bern, Schwyz etc., but sometimes also at places outside of the confederation, such as Constance. From the Swabian War in 1499 onwards until Reformation, most conferences met in Zurich. Afterwards, the town hall at Baden, where the annual accounts of the common people had been held regularly since 1426, became the most frequent, but not the sole place of assembly. After 1712 Frauenfeld gradually dissolved Baden. From 1526, the Catholic conferences were held mostly in Lucerne, the Protestant conferences from 1528 mostly in Aarau, the one for the legitimation of the French Ambassador in Solothurn. At the same time the syndicate for the Ennetbirgischen Vogteien located in the present Ticino met from 1513 in Lugano and Locarno.[101] After the Helvetic Republic and during the Mediation from 1803 until 1815 the Confederal Diet of the 19 Lieus met at the capitals of the directoral cantons Fribourg, Berne, Basel, Zurich, Lucerne and Solothurn.[101] After the Long Diet from 6 April 1814 to 31 August 1815 took place in Zurich to replace the constitution and the enhancement of the Confederation to 22 cantons by the admission of the cantons of Valais, Neuchâtel and Geneva to full members, the directorial cantons of Lucerne, Zurich and Berne took over the diet in two-year turns.[101] In 1848, the federal constitution provided that details concerning the federal institutions, such as their locations, should be taken care of by the Federal Assembly (BV 1848 Art. 108). Thus on 28 November 1848, the Federal Assembly voted in majority to locate the seat of government in Berne. And, as a prototypical federal compromise, to assign other federal institutions, such as the Federal Polytechnical School (1854, the later ETH) to Zurich, and other institutions to Lucerne, such as the later SUVA (1912) and the Federal Insurance Court (1917). In 1875, a law (RS 112) fixed the compensations owed by the city of Bern for the federal seat.[1] According to these living fundamental federalistic feelings further federal institutions were subsequently attributed to Lausanne (Federal Supreme Court in 1872, and EPFL in 1969), Bellinzona (Federal Criminal Court, 2004), and St. Gallen (Federal Administrative Court and Federal Patent Court, 2012). The 1999 new constitution, however, does not contain anything concerning any Federal City. In 2002 a tripartite committee has been asked by the Swiss Federal Council to prepare the ""creation of a federal law on the status of Bern as a Federal City"", and to evaluate the positive and negative aspects for the city and the canton of Bern if this status were awarded. After a first report, the work of this committee was suspended in 2004 by the Swiss Federal Council, and work on this subject has not resumed since.[102] Thus as of today, no city in Switzerland has the official status either of capital or of Federal City, nevertheless, Bern is commonly referred to as ""Federal City"" (German: Bundesstadt, French: ville fédérale, Italian: città federale). Economy and labour law Main article: Economy of Switzerland See also: Banking in Switzerland, Taxation in Switzerland, and Federal budget of Switzerland The city of Basel (Roche Tower) is the capital of the country's pharmaceutical industry, which accounts for around 38% of Swiss exports worldwide.[103] The Greater Zürich area, home to 1.5 million inhabitants and 150,000 companies, is one of the most important economic centres in the world.[104] The Omega Speedmaster worn on the moon during the Apollo missions. In terms of value, Switzerland is responsible for half of the world production of watches.[55][105] Origin of the capital at the 30 biggest Swiss corporations, 2018[106] Switzerland (39%)  North America (33%)  Europe (24%)  Rest of the world (4%) Switzerland has a stable, prosperous and high-tech economy and enjoys great wealth, being ranked as the wealthiest country in the world per capita in multiple rankings. The country has been ranked as one of the least corrupt countries in the world,[107][108][109] while its banking sector has been rated as ""one of the most corrupt in the world"".[110] It has the world's twentieth largest economy by nominal GDP and the thirty-eighth largest by purchasing power parity. It is the seventeenth largest exporter. Zürich and Geneva are regarded as global cities, ranked as Alpha and Beta respectively. Basel is the capital of the pharmaceutical industry in Switzerland. With its world-class companies, Novartis and Roche, and many other players, it is also one of the world's most important centres for the life sciences industry.[111] Switzerland has the highest European rating in the Index of Economic Freedom 2010, while also providing large coverage through public services.[112] The nominal per capita GDP is higher than those of the larger Western and Central European economies and Japan.[113] In terms of GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power, Switzerland was ranked 5th in the world in 2018 by World Bank[114] and estimated at 9th by the IMF in 2020,[115] as well as 11th by the CIA World Factbook in 2017.[116] The World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report currently ranks Switzerland's economy as the most competitive in the world,[117] it is ranked by the European Union as Europe's most innovative country and as the most innovative country in the Global Innovation Index in 2020.[118][119][120] It is a relatively easy place to do business, currently ranking 20th of 189 countries in the Ease of Doing Business Index. The slow growth Switzerland experienced in the 1990s and the early 2000s has brought greater support for economic reforms and harmonisation with the European Union.[121][122] For much of the 20th century, Switzerland was the wealthiest country in Europe by a considerable margin (by GDP – per capita).[123] Switzerland also has one of the world's largest account balances as a percentage of GDP.[124] In 2018, the canton of Basel-City had the highest GDP per capita in the country, ahead of the cantons of Zug and Geneva.[125] According to Credit Suisse, only about 37% of residents own their own homes, one of the lowest rates of home ownership in Europe. Housing and food price levels were 171% and 145% of the EU-25 index in 2007, compared to 113% and 104% in Germany.[126] Switzerland is home to several large multinational corporations. The largest Swiss companies by revenue are Glencore, Gunvor, Nestlé, Mediterranean Shipping Company, Novartis, Hoffmann-La Roche, ABB, Mercuria Energy Group and Adecco.[127] Also, notable are UBS AG, Zurich Financial Services, Richemont, Credit Suisse, Barry Callebaut, Swiss Re, Rolex, Tetra Pak, The Swatch Group and Swiss International Air Lines. Switzerland is ranked as having one of the most powerful economies in the world.[123][dubious – discuss] Switzerland's most important economic sector is manufacturing. Manufacturing consists largely of the production of specialist chemicals, health and pharmaceutical goods, scientific and precision measuring instruments and musical instruments. The largest exported goods are chemicals (34% of exported goods), machines/electronics (20.9%), and precision instruments/watches (16.9%).[126] Exported services amount to a third of exports.[126] The service sector – especially banking and insurance, tourism, and international organisations – is another important industry for Switzerland. The high valley of Engadine. Tourism constitutes an important revenue for the less industrialised alpine regions.Agricultural protectionism—a rare exception to Switzerland's free trade policies—has contributed to high food prices. Product market liberalisation is lagging behind many EU countries according to the OECD.[121] Nevertheless, domestic purchasing power is one of the best in the world.[128][129][130] Apart from agriculture, economic and trade barriers between the European Union and Switzerland are minimal and Switzerland has free trade agreements worldwide. Switzerland is a member of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). Taxation and government spending Switzerland has an overwhelmingly private sector economy and low tax rates by Western World standards; overall taxation is one of the smallest of developed countries. The Swiss Federal budget had a size of 62.8 billion Swiss francs in 2010, which is an equivalent 11.35% of the country's GDP in that year; however, the regional (canton) budgets and the budgets of the municipalities are not counted as part of the federal budget and the total rate of government spending is closer to 33.8% of GDP. The main sources of income for the federal government are the value-added tax (accounting for 33% of tax revenue) and the direct federal tax (29%), with the main areas of expenditure in social welfare and finance/taxes. The expenditures of the Swiss Confederation have been growing from 7% of GDP in 1960 to 9.7% in 1990 and to 10.7% in 2010. While the sectors social welfare and finance & tax have been growing from 35% in 1990 to 48.2% in 2010, a significant reduction of expenditures has been occurring in the sectors of agriculture and national defence; from 26.5% in to 12.4% (estimation for the year 2015).[131][132] Labour market Slightly more than 5 million people work in Switzerland;[133] about 25% of employees belonged to a trade union in 2004.[134] Switzerland has a more flexible job market than neighbouring countries and the unemployment rate is very low. The unemployment rate increased from a low of 1.7% in June 2000 to a peak of 4.4% in December 2009.[135] The unemployment rate decreased to 3.2% in 2014 and held steady at that level for several years,[136] before further dropping to 2.5% in 2018 and 2.3% in 2019.[137] Population growth from net immigration is quite high, at 0.52% of population in 2004, increased in the following years before falling to 0.54% again in 2017.[126][138] The foreign citizen population was 28.9% in 2015, about the same as in Australia. GDP per hour worked is the world's 16th highest, at 49.46 international dollars in 2012.[139] In 2016, the median monthly gross salary in Switzerland was 6,502 francs per month (equivalent to US$6,597 per month), is just enough to cover the high cost of living. After rent, taxes and social security contributions, plus spending on goods and services, the average household has about 15% of its gross income left for savings. Though 61% of the population made less than the average income, income inequality is relatively low with a Gini coefficient of 29.7, placing Switzerland among the top 20 countries for income equality. About 8.2% of the population live below the national poverty line, defined in Switzerland as earning less than CHF3,990 per month for a household of two adults and two children, and a further 15% are at risk of poverty. Single-parent families, those with no post-compulsory education and those who are out of work are among the most likely to be living below the poverty line. Although getting a job is considered a way out of poverty, among the gainfully employed, some 4.3% are considered working poor. One in ten jobs in Switzerland is considered low-paid and roughly 12% of Swiss workers hold such jobs, many of them women and foreigners. Education and science The University of Basel is Switzerland's oldest university (1460). Main articles: Education in Switzerland and Science and technology in Switzerland Some Swiss scientists who played a key role in their discipline (clockwise):Leonhard Euler (mathematics)Louis Agassiz (glaciology)Auguste Piccard (aeronautics)Albert Einstein (physics) Education in Switzerland is very diverse because the constitution of Switzerland delegates the authority for the school system to the cantons.[140] There are both public and private schools, including many private international schools. The minimum age for primary school is about six years in all cantons, but most cantons provide a free ""children's school"" starting at four or five years old.[140] Primary school continues until grade four, five or six, depending on the school. Traditionally, the first foreign language in school was always one of the other national languages, although in 2000 English was introduced first in a few cantons.[140]At the end of primary school (or at the beginning of secondary school), pupils are separated according to their capacities in several (often three) sections. The fastest learners are taught advanced classes to be prepared for further studies and the matura,[140] while students who assimilate a little more slowly receive an education more adapted to their needs. There are 12 universities in Switzerland, ten of which are maintained at cantonal level and usually offer a range of non-technical subjects. The first university in Switzerland was founded in 1460 in Basel (with a faculty of medicine) and has a tradition of chemical and medical research in Switzerland. It is listed 87th on the 2019 Academic Ranking of World Universities.[141] The largest university in Switzerland is the University of Zurich with nearly 25,000 students.[citation needed] The Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETHZ) and the University of Zurich are listed 20th and 54th respectively, on the 2015 Academic Ranking of World Universities.[142][143][144] The two institutes sponsored by the federal government are the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETHZ) in Zürich, founded 1855 and the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Lausanne, founded 1969 as such, which was formerly an institute associated with the University of Lausanne.[note 10][145][146] Eight of ten best hotel schools in the world are located in Switzerland.[147] In addition, there are various Universities of Applied Sciences. In business and management studies, the University of St. Gallen, (HSG) is ranked 329th in the world according to QS World University Rankings[148] and the International Institute for Management Development (IMD), was ranked first in open programmes worldwide by the Financial Times.[149] Switzerland has the second highest rate (almost 18% in 2003) of foreign students in tertiary education, after Australia (slightly over 18%).[150][151] As might befit a country that plays home to innumerable international organisations, the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, located in Geneva, is not only continental Europe's oldest graduate school of international and development studies, but also widely believed to be one of its most prestigious.[152][153] Many Nobel Prize laureates have been Swiss scientists. They include the world-famous physicist Albert Einstein[154] in the field of physics, who developed his special relativity while working in Bern. More recently Vladimir Prelog, Heinrich Rohrer, Richard Ernst, Edmond Fischer, Rolf Zinkernagel, Kurt Wüthrich and Jacques Dubochet received Nobel Prizes in the sciences. In total, 114 Nobel Prize winners in all fields stand in relation to Switzerland[155][note 11] and the Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded nine times to organisations residing in Switzerland.[156] The LHC tunnel. CERN is the world's largest laboratory and also the birthplace of the World Wide Web.[157] Geneva and the nearby French department of Ain co-host the world's largest laboratory, CERN,[158] dedicated to particle physics research. Another important research centre is the Paul Scherrer Institute. Notable inventions include lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), diazepam (Valium), the scanning tunnelling microscope (Nobel prize) and Velcro. Some technologies enabled the exploration of new worlds such as the pressurised balloon of Auguste Piccard and the Bathyscaphe which permitted Jacques Piccard to reach the deepest point of the world's oceans. Switzerland Space Agency, the Swiss Space Office, has been involved in various space technologies and programmes. In addition it was one of the 10 founders of the European Space Agency in 1975 and is the seventh largest contributor to the ESA budget. In the private sector, several companies are implicated in the space industry such as Oerlikon Space[159] or Maxon Motors[160] who provide spacecraft structures. Switzerland and the European Union Main article: Switzerland–European Union relations Switzerland voted against membership in the European Economic Area in a referendum in December 1992 and has since maintained and developed its relationships with the European Union (EU) and European countries through bilateral agreements. In March 2001, the Swiss people refused in a popular vote to start accession negotiations with the EU.[161] In recent years, the Swiss have brought their economic practices largely into conformity with those of the EU in many ways, in an effort to enhance their international competitiveness. The economy grew at 3% in 2010, 1.9% in 2011, and 1% in 2012.[162] EU membership was a long-term objective of the Swiss government, but there was and remains considerable popular sentiment against membership, which is opposed by the conservative SVP party, the largest party in the National Council, and not currently supported or proposed by several other political parties. The application for membership of the EU was formally withdrawn in 2016, having long been frozen. The western French-speaking areas and the urban regions of the rest of the country tend to be more pro-EU, nonetheless with far from a significant share of the population.[163][164] Members of the European Free Trade Association (green) participate in the European Single Market and are part of the Schengen Area. The government has established an Integration Office under the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Economic Affairs. To minimise the negative consequences of Switzerland's isolation from the rest of Europe, Bern and Brussels signed seven bilateral agreements to further liberalise trade ties. These agreements were signed in 1999 and took effect in 2001. This first series of bilateral agreements included the free movement of persons. A second series covering nine areas was signed in 2004 and has since been ratified, which includes the Schengen Treaty and the Dublin Convention besides others.[165] They continue to discuss further areas for cooperation.[166] In 2006, Switzerland approved 1 billion francs of supportive investment in the poorer Southern and Central European countries in support of cooperation and positive ties to the EU as a whole. A further referendum will be needed to approve 300 million francs to support Romania and Bulgaria and their recent admission. The Swiss have also been under EU and sometimes international pressure to reduce banking secrecy and to raise tax rates to parity with the EU. Preparatory discussions are being opened in four new areas: opening up the electricity market, participation in the European GNSS project Galileo, cooperating with the European centre for disease prevention and recognising certificates of origin for food products.[167] On 27 November 2008, the interior and justice ministers of the European Union in Brussels announced Switzerland's accession to the Schengen passport-free zone from 12 December 2008. The land border checkpoints will remain in place only for goods movements, but should not run controls on people, though people entering the country had their passports checked until 29 March 2009 if they originated from a Schengen nation.[168] On 9 February 2014, Swiss voters narrowly approved by 50.3% a ballot initiative launched by the national conservative Swiss People's Party (SVP/UDC) to restrict immigration, and thus reintroducing a quota system on the influx of foreigners. This initiative was mostly backed by rural (57.6% approvals) and suburban agglomerations (51.2% approvals), and isolated towns (51.3% approvals) as well as by a strong majority (69.2% approval) in the canton of Ticino, while metropolitan centres (58.5% rejection) and the French-speaking part (58.5% rejection) rather rejected it.[169] Some news commentators claim that this proposal de facto contradicts the bilateral agreements on the free movement of persons from these respective countries.[170][171] In December 2016, a political compromise with the European Union was attained effectively canceling quotas on EU citizens but still allowing for favourable treatment of Swiss-based job applicants.[172] On 27 September 2020, Swiss voters clearly rejected the anti-free movement popular initiative by the conservative Swiss People's Party (SVP) with nearly 62% ""no"" votes, reflecting democratic support for bilateral agreements with the European Union.[173] Energy, infrastructure and environment See also: Energy in Switzerland, Transport in Switzerland, Waste management in Switzerland, and Environment of Switzerland Switzerland has the tallest dams in Europe, among which the Mauvoisin Dam, in the Alps. Hydroelectricity is the most important domestic source of energy in the country. Electricity generated in Switzerland is 56% from hydroelectricity and 39% from nuclear power, resulting in a nearly CO2-free electricity-generating network. On 18 May 2003, two anti-nuclear initiatives were turned down: Moratorium Plus, aimed at forbidding the building of new nuclear power plants (41.6% supported and 58.4% opposed),[174] and Electricity Without Nuclear (33.7% supported and 66.3% opposed) after a previous moratorium expired in 2000.[175] However, as a reaction to the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the Swiss government announced in 2011 that it plans to end its use of nuclear energy in the next 2 or 3 decades.[176] In November 2016, Swiss voters rejected a proposal by the Green Party to accelerate the phaseout of nuclear power (45.8% supported and 54.2% opposed).[177] The Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE) is the office responsible for all questions relating to energy supply and energy use within the Federal Department of Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications (DETEC). The agency is supporting the 2000-watt society initiative to cut the nation's energy use by more than half by the year 2050.[178] Entrance of the new Lötschberg Base Tunnel, the third-longest railway tunnel in the world, under the old Lötschberg railway line. It was the first completed tunnel of the greater project NRLA. The most dense rail network in Europe[55] of 5,250 kilometres (3,260 mi) carries over 596 million passengers annually (as of 2015).[179] In 2015, each Swiss resident travelled on average 2,550 kilometres (1,580 mi) by rail, which makes them the keenest rail users.[179] Virtually 100% of the network is electrified. The vast majority (60%) of the network is operated by the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB CFF FFS). Besides the second largest standard gauge railway company BLS AG two railways companies operating on narrow gauge networks are the Rhaetian Railway (RhB) in the southeastern canton of Graubünden, which includes some World Heritage lines,[180] and the Matterhorn Gotthard Bahn (MGB), which co-operates together with RhB the Glacier Express between Zermatt and St. Moritz/Davos. On 31 May 2016 the world's longest and deepest railway tunnel and the first flat, low-level route through the Alps, the 57.1-kilometre long (35.5 mi) Gotthard Base Tunnel, opened as the largest part of the New Railway Link through the Alps (NRLA) project after 17 years of realization. It started its daily business for passenger transport on 11 December 2016 replacing the old, mountainous, scenic route over and through the St Gotthard Massif. Switzerland has a publicly managed road network without road tolls that is financed by highway permits as well as vehicle and gasoline taxes. The Swiss autobahn/autoroute system requires the purchase of a vignette (toll sticker)—which costs 40 Swiss francs—for one calendar year in order to use its roadways, for both passenger cars and trucks. The Swiss autobahn/autoroute network has a total length of 1,638 km (1,018 mi) (as of 2000) and has, by an area of 41,290 km2 (15,940 sq mi), also one of the highest motorway densities in the world.[181] Zurich Airport is Switzerland's largest international flight gateway, which handled 22.8 million passengers in 2012.[182] The other international airports are Geneva Airport (13.9 million passengers in 2012),[183] EuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg which is located in France, Bern Airport, Lugano Airport, St. Gallen-Altenrhein Airport and Sion Airport. Swiss International Air Lines is the flag carrier of Switzerland. Its main hub is Zürich, but it is legally domiciled in Basel. Switzerland has one of the best environmental records among nations in the developed world;[184] it was one of the countries to sign the Kyoto Protocol in 1998 and ratified it in 2003. With Mexico and the Republic of Korea it forms the Environmental Integrity Group (EIG).[185] The country is heavily active in recycling and anti-littering regulations and is one of the top recyclers in the world, with 66% to 96% of recyclable materials being recycled, depending on the area of the country.[186] The 2014 Global Green Economy Index ranked Switzerland among the top 10 green economies in the world.[187] Switzerland developed an efficient system to recycle most recyclable materials.[188] Publicly organised collection by volunteers and economical railway transport logistics started as early as 1865 under the leadership of the notable industrialist Hans Caspar Escher (Escher Wyss AG) when the first modern Swiss paper manufacturing plant was built in Biberist.[189] Switzerland also has an economic system for garbage disposal, which is based mostly on recycling and energy-producing incinerators due to a strong political will to protect the environment.[190] As in other European countries, the illegal disposal of garbage is not tolerated at all and heavily fined. In almost all Swiss municipalities, stickers or dedicated garbage bags need to be purchased that allow for the identification of disposable garbage.[191] Demographics Main articles: Demographics of Switzerland and Swiss people Further information: List of Swiss people Population density in Switzerland (2019) Percentage of foreigners in Switzerland (2019) In 2018, Switzerland's population slightly exceeded 8.5 million. In common with other developed countries, the Swiss population increased rapidly during the industrial era, quadrupling between 1800 and 1990 and has continued to grow. Like most of Europe, Switzerland faces an ageing population, albeit with consistent annual growth projected into 2035, due mostly to immigration and a fertility rate close to replacement level.[192] Switzerland subsequently has one of the oldest populations in the world, with the average age of 42.5 years.[193] As of 2019[update], resident foreigners make up 25.2% of the population, one of the largest proportions in the developed world.[9] Most of these (64%) were from European Union or EFTA countries.[194] Italians were the largest single group of foreigners, with 15.6% of total foreign population, followed closely by Germans (15.2%), immigrants from Portugal (12.7%), France (5.6%), Serbia (5.3%), Turkey (3.8%), Spain (3.7%), and Austria (2%). Immigrants from Sri Lanka, most of them former Tamil refugees, were the largest group among people of Asian origin (6.3%).[194] Additionally, the figures from 2012 show that 34.7% of the permanent resident population aged 15 or over in Switzerland (around 2.33 million), had an immigrant background. A third of this population (853,000) held Swiss citizenship. Four fifths of persons with an immigration background were themselves immigrants (first generation foreigners and native-born and naturalised Swiss citizens), whereas one fifth were born in Switzerland (second generation foreigners and native-born and naturalised Swiss citizens).[195] In the 2000s, domestic and international institutions expressed concern about what was perceived as an increase in xenophobia, particularly in some political campaigns. In reply to one critical report, the Federal Council noted that ""racism unfortunately is present in Switzerland"", but stated that the high proportion of foreign citizens in the country, as well as the generally unproblematic integration of foreigners, underlined Switzerland's openness.[196] Follow-up study conducted in 2018 found that 59% considered racism a serious problem in Switzerland.[197] The proportion of the population that has reported being targeted by racial discrimination has increased in recent years, from 10% in 2014 to almost 17% in 2018, according to the Federal Statistical Office.[198] Drug use is comparable to other developed countries[citation needed][dubious – discuss] with 14% of men and 6.5% of women between 20 and 24 saying they had consumed cannabis in the past 30 days,[199] and 5 Swiss cities were listed among the top 10 European cities for cocaine use as measured in wastewater.[200][201] Languages Main article: Languages of Switzerland National languages in Switzerland (2016):   German (62.8%)   French (22.9%)   Italian (8.2%)   Romansh (0.5%)[202] Switzerland has four national languages: mainly German (spoken by 62.8% of the population in 2016); French (22.9%) in the west; and Italian (8.2%) in the south.[203][202] The fourth national language, Romansh (0.5%), is a Romance language spoken locally in the southeastern trilingual canton of Grisons, and is designated by Article 4 of the Federal Constitution as a national language along with German, French, and Italian, and in Article 70 as an official language if the authorities communicate with persons who speak Romansh. However, federal laws and other official acts do not need to be decreed in Romansh. In 2016, the languages most spoken at home among permanent residents aged 15 and older were Swiss German (59.4%), French (23.5%), Standard German (10.6%), and Italian (8.5%). Other languages spoken at home included English (5.0%), Portuguese (3.8%), Albanian (3.0%), Spanish (2.6%) and Serbian and Croatian (2.5%). 6.9% reported speaking another language at home.[204] In 2014 almost two-thirds (64.4%) of the permanent resident population indicated speaking more than one language regularly.[205] The federal government is obliged to communicate in the official languages, and in the federal parliament simultaneous translation is provided from and into German, French and Italian.[206] Aside from the official forms of their respective languages, the four linguistic regions of Switzerland also have their local dialectal forms. The role played by dialects in each linguistic region varies dramatically: in the German-speaking regions, Swiss German dialects have become ever more prevalent since the second half of the 20th century, especially in the media, such as radio and television, and are used as an everyday language for many, while the Swiss variety of Standard German is almost always used instead of dialect for written communication (c.f. diglossic usage of a language).[207] Conversely, in the French-speaking regions the local dialects have almost disappeared (only 6.3% of the population of Valais, 3.9% of Fribourg, and 3.1% of Jura still spoke dialects at the end of the 20th century), while in the Italian-speaking regions dialects are mostly limited to family settings and casual conversation.[207] The principal official languages (German, French, and Italian) have terms, not used outside of Switzerland, known as Helvetisms. German Helvetisms are, roughly speaking, a large group of words typical of Swiss Standard German, which do not appear either in Standard German, nor in other German dialects. These include terms from Switzerland's surrounding language cultures (German Billett[208] from French), from similar terms in another language (Italian azione used not only as act but also as discount from German Aktion).[209] The French spoken in Switzerland has similar terms, which are equally known as Helvetisms. The most frequent characteristics of Helvetisms are in vocabulary, phrases, and pronunciation, but certain Helvetisms denote themselves as special in syntax and orthography likewise. Duden, the comprehensive German dictionary, contains about 3000 Helvetisms.[209] Current French dictionaries, such as the Petit Larousse, include several hundred Helvetisms.[210] Learning one of the other national languages at school is compulsory for all Swiss pupils, so many Swiss are supposed to be at least bilingual, especially those belonging to linguistic minority groups.[211] Health Main articles: Health in Switzerland and Healthcare in Switzerland Swiss residents are universally required to buy health insurance from private insurance companies, which in turn are required to accept every applicant. While the cost of the system is among the highest, it compares well with other European countries in terms of health outcomes; patients have been reported as being, in general, highly satisfied with it.[212][213][214] In 2012, life expectancy at birth was 80.4 years for men and 84.7 years for women[215] — the highest in the world.[216][217] However, spending on health is particularly high at 11.4% of GDP (2010), on par with Germany and France (11.6%) and other European countries, but notably less than spending in the USA (17.6%).[218] From 1990, a steady increase can be observed, reflecting the high costs of the services provided.[219] With an ageing population and new healthcare technologies, health spending will likely continue to rise.[219] It is estimated that one out of six persons in Switzerland suffers from mental illness.[220] Urbanisation Main article: Towns of Switzerland Urbanisation in the Rhone Valley (outskirts of Sion) Between two thirds and three quarters of the population live in urban areas.[221][222] Switzerland has gone from a largely rural country to an urban one in just 70 years. Since 1935 urban development has claimed as much of the Swiss landscape as it did during the previous 2,000 years. This urban sprawl does not only affect the plateau but also the Jura and the Alpine foothills[223] and there are growing concerns about land use.[224] However, from the beginning of the 21st century, the population growth in urban areas is higher than in the countryside.[222] Switzerland has a dense network of towns, where large, medium and small towns are complementary.[222] The plateau is very densely populated with about 450 people per km2 and the landscape continually shows signs of human presence.[225] The weight of the largest metropolitan areas, which are Zürich, Geneva–Lausanne, Basel and Bern tend to increase.[222] In international comparison the importance of these urban areas is stronger than their number of inhabitants suggests.[222] In addition the three main centres of Zürich, Geneva and Basel are recognised for their particularly great quality of life.[226] Largest cities vte Largest towns in SwitzerlandSwiss Federal Statistical Office (FSO), Neuchâtel, 2019[227] Rank Name Canton Pop.

These churches, and in some cantons also the Old Catholic Church and Jewish congregations, are financed by official taxation of adherents.[228] Christianity is the predominant religion of Switzerland (about 67% of resident population in 2016-2018[4] and 75% of Swiss citizens[229]), divided between the Catholic Church (35.8% of the population), the Swiss Reformed Church (23.8%), further Protestant churches (2.2%), Eastern Orthodoxy (2.5%), and other Christian denominations (2.2%).[4] Immigration has established Islam (5.3%) as a sizeable minority religion.[4] 26.3% of Swiss permanent residents are not affiliated with any religious community (Atheism, Agnosticism, and others).[4] As of the 2000 census other Christian minority communities included Neo-Pietism (0.44%), Pentecostalism (0.28%, mostly incorporated in the Schweizer Pfingstmission), Methodism (0.13%), the New Apostolic Church (0.45%), Jehovah's Witnesses (0.28%), other Protestant denominations (0.20%), the Old Catholic Church (0.18%), other Christian denominations (0.20%). Non-Christian religions are Hinduism (0.38%), Buddhism (0.29%), Judaism (0.25%) and others (0.11%); 4.3% did not make a statement.[230] The country was historically about evenly balanced between Catholic and Protestant, with a complex patchwork of majorities over most of the country. Switzerland played an exceptional role during the Reformation as it became home to many reformers. Geneva converted to Protestantism in 1536, just before John Calvin arrived there. In 1541, he founded the Republic of Geneva on his own ideals. It became known internationally as the Protestant Rome, and housed such reformers as Theodore Beza, William Farel or Pierre Viret. Zürich became another stronghold around the same time, with Huldrych Zwingli and Heinrich Bullinger taking the lead there. Anabaptists Felix Manz and Conrad Grebel also operated there. They were later joined by the fleeing Peter Martyr Vermigli and Hans Denck. Other centres included Basel (Andreas Karlstadt and Johannes Oecolampadius), Berne (Berchtold Haller and Niklaus Manuel), and St. Gallen (Joachim Vadian). One canton, Appenzell, was officially divided into Catholic and Protestant sections in 1597. The larger cities and their cantons (Bern, Geneva, Lausanne, Zürich and Basel) used to be predominantly Protestant. Central Switzerland, the Valais, the Ticino, Appenzell Innerrhodes, the Jura, and Fribourg are traditionally Catholic. The Swiss Constitution of 1848, under the recent impression of the clashes of Catholic vs. Protestant cantons that culminated in the Sonderbundskrieg, consciously defines a consociational state, allowing the peaceful co-existence of Catholics and Protestants. A 1980 initiative calling for the complete separation of church and state was rejected by 78.9% of the voters.[231] Some traditionally Protestant cantons and cities nowadays have a slight Catholic majority, not because they were growing in members, quite the contrary, but only because since about 1970 a steadily growing minority became not affiliated with any church or other religious body (21.4% in Switzerland, 2012) especially in traditionally Protestant regions, such as Basel-City (42%), canton of Neuchâtel (38%), canton of Geneva (35%), canton of Vaud (26%), or Zürich city (city: >25%; canton: 23%).[232] Culture Main article: Culture of Switzerland See also: Music of Switzerland, Swiss folklore, and Alpine culture Alphorn concert in Vals Three of Europe's major languages are official in Switzerland. Swiss culture is characterised by diversity, which is reflected in a wide range of traditional customs.[233] A region may be in some ways strongly culturally connected to the neighbouring country that shares its language, the country itself being rooted in western European culture.[234] The linguistically isolated Romansh culture in Graubünden in eastern Switzerland constitutes an exception, it survives only in the upper valleys of the Rhine and the Inn and strives to maintain its rare linguistic tradition. Switzerland is home to many notable contributors to literature, art, architecture, music and sciences. In addition the country attracted a number of creative persons during time of unrest or war in Europe.[235] Some 1000 museums are distributed through the country; the number has more than tripled since 1950.[236] Among the most important cultural performances held annually are the Paléo Festival, Lucerne Festival,[237] the Montreux Jazz Festival,[238] the Locarno International Film Festival and the Art Basel.[239] Alpine symbolism has played an essential role in shaping the history of the country and the Swiss national identity.[17][240] Many alpine areas and ski resorts offer winter sports during the colder months as well as hiking (German: das Wandern) or Mountain biking in summer. Other areas throughout the year have a recreational culture that caters to tourism such as sightseeing, yet the quieter seasons are spring and autumn when there are fewer visitors. A traditional farmer and herder culture also predominates in many areas and small farms are omnipresent outside the towns. Folk art is kept alive in organisations all over the country. In Switzerland, it is mostly expressed in music, dance, poetry, wood carving and embroidery. The alphorn, a trumpet-like musical instrument made of wood, has become alongside yodeling and the accordion an epitome of traditional Swiss music.[241][242] Literature Main article: Literature of Switzerland Jean-Jacques Rousseau was not only a writer but also an influential philosopher of the eighteenth century.[243] As the Confederation, from its foundation in 1291, was almost exclusively composed of German-speaking regions, the earliest forms of literature are in German. In the 18th century, French became the fashionable language in Bern and elsewhere, while the influence of the French-speaking allies and subject lands was more marked than before.[244] Among the classic authors of Swiss German literature are Jeremias Gotthelf (1797–1854) and Gottfried Keller (1819–1890). The undisputed giants of 20th-century Swiss literature are Max Frisch (1911–91) and Friedrich Dürrenmatt (1921–90), whose repertoire includes Die Physiker (The Physicists) and Das Versprechen (The Pledge), released in 2001 as a Hollywood film.[245] Famous French-speaking writers were Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712–1778) and Germaine de Staël (1766–1817). More recent authors include Charles Ferdinand Ramuz (1878–1947), whose novels describe the lives of peasants and mountain dwellers, set in a harsh environment and Blaise Cendrars (born Frédéric Sauser, 1887–1961).[245] Italian and Romansh-speaking authors also contributed to the Swiss literary landscape, but generally in more modest ways given their small number. Probably the most famous Swiss literary creation, Heidi, the story of an orphan girl who lives with her grandfather in the Alps, is one of the most popular children's books ever and has come to be a symbol of Switzerland. Her creator, Johanna Spyri (1827–1901), wrote a number of other books on similar themes.[245] Media Main article: Media of Switzerland The freedom of the press and the right to free expression is guaranteed in the federal constitution of Switzerland.[246] The Swiss News Agency (SNA) broadcasts information around-the-clock in three of the four national languages—on politics, economics, society and culture. The SNA supplies almost all Swiss media and a couple of dozen foreign media services with its news.[246] Switzerland has historically boasted the greatest number of newspaper titles published in proportion to its population and size.[247] The most influential newspapers are the German-language Tages-Anzeiger and Neue Zürcher Zeitung NZZ, and the French-language Le Temps, but almost every city has at least one local newspaper. The cultural diversity accounts for a variety of newspapers.[247] The government exerts greater control over broadcast media than print media, especially due to finance and licensing.[247] The Swiss Broadcasting Corporation, whose name was recently changed to SRG SSR, is charged with the production and broadcast of radio and television programmes. SRG SSR studios are distributed throughout the various language regions. Radio content is produced in six central and four regional studios while the television programmes are produced in Geneva, Zürich, Basel, and Lugano. An extensive cable network also allows most Swiss to access the programmes from neighbouring countries.[247] Sports Main article: Sport in Switzerland Ski area over the glaciers of Saas-Fee Skiing, snowboarding and mountaineering are among the most popular sports in Switzerland, the nature of the country being particularly suited for such activities.[248] Winter sports are practised by the natives and tourists since the second half of the 19th century with the invention of bobsleigh in St. Moritz.[249] The first world ski championships were held in Mürren (1931) and St. Moritz (1934). The latter town hosted the second Winter Olympic Games in 1928 and the fifth edition in 1948. Among the most successful skiers and world champions are Pirmin Zurbriggen and Didier Cuche. The most prominently watched sports in Switzerland are football, ice hockey, Alpine skiing, ""Schwingen"", and tennis.[250] The headquarters of the international football's and ice hockey's governing bodies, the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA) and International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF), are located in Zürich. Many other headquarters of international sports federations are located in Switzerland. For example, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), IOC's Olympic Museum and the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) are located in Lausanne. Switzerland hosted the 1954 FIFA World Cup, and was the joint host, with Austria, of the UEFA Euro 2008 tournament. The Swiss Super League is the nation's professional football club league. Europe's highest football pitch, at 2,000 metres (6,600 ft) above sea level, is located in Switzerland and is named the Ottmar Hitzfeld Stadium.[251] Roger Federer has won a record 20 Grand Slam singles titles, making him the most successful men's tennis player ever.[252] Many Swiss also follow ice hockey and support one of the 12 teams of the National League, which is the most attended league in Europe.[253] In 2009, Switzerland hosted the IIHF World Championship for the 10th time.[254] It also became World Vice-Champion in 2013 and 2018. The numerous lakes make Switzerland an attractive place for sailing. The largest, Lake Geneva, is the home of the sailing team Alinghi which was the first European team to win the America's Cup in 2003 and which successfully defended the title in 2007. Swiss tennis player Roger Federer is widely regarded as one of the greatest tennis players of all time. He has won 20 Grand Slam tournaments overall including a record 8 Wimbledon titles. He has also won a record 6 ATP Finals.[255] He was ranked no. 1 in the ATP Rankings for a record 237 consecutive weeks. He ended 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2009 ranked no. 1. Fellow swiss tennis stars Martina Hingis and Stan Wawrinka also hold multiple Grand Slam titles. Switzerland won the Davis Cup title in 2014. Motorsport racecourses and events were banned in Switzerland following the 1955 Le Mans disaster with exception to events such as Hillclimbing. During this period, the country still produced successful racing drivers such as Clay Regazzoni, Sébastien Buemi, Jo Siffert, Dominique Aegerter, successful World Touring Car Championship driver Alain Menu, 2014 24 Hours of Le Mans winner Marcel Fässler and 2015 24 Hours Nürburgring winner Nico Müller. Switzerland also won the A1GP World Cup of Motorsport in 2007–08 with driver Neel Jani. Swiss motorcycle racer Thomas Lüthi won the 2005 MotoGP World Championship in the 125cc category. In June 2007 the Swiss National Council, one house of the Federal Assembly of Switzerland, voted to overturn the ban, however the other house, the Swiss Council of States rejected the change and the ban remains in place.[256][257] Traditional sports include Swiss wrestling or ""Schwingen"". It is an old tradition from the rural central cantons and considered the national sport by some. Hornussen is another indigenous Swiss sport, which is like a cross between baseball and golf.[258] Steinstossen is the Swiss variant of stone put, a competition in throwing a heavy stone. Practised only among the alpine population since prehistoric times, it is recorded to have taken place in Basel in the 13th century. It is also central to the Unspunnenfest, first held in 1805, with its symbol the 83.5 stone named Unspunnenstein.[259] Cuisine Main article: Swiss cuisine See also: Culinary Heritage of Switzerland Fondue is melted cheese, into which bread is dipped. The cuisine of Switzerland is multifaceted. While some dishes such as fondue, raclette or rösti are omnipresent through the country, each region developed its own gastronomy according to the differences of climate and languages.[260][261] Traditional Swiss cuisine uses ingredients similar to those in other European countries, as well as unique dairy products and cheeses such as Gruyère or Emmental, produced in the valleys of Gruyères and Emmental. The number of fine-dining establishments is high, particularly in western Switzerland.[262][263] Chocolate has been made in Switzerland since the 18th century but it gained its reputation at the end of the 19th century with the invention of modern techniques such as conching and tempering which enabled its production on a high-quality level. Also a breakthrough was the invention of solid milk chocolate in 1875 by Daniel Peter. The Swiss are the world's largest consumers of chocolate.[264][265] Due to the popularisation of processed foods at the end of the 19th century, Swiss health food pioneer Maximilian Bircher-Benner created the first nutrition-based therapy in form of the well-known rolled oats cereal dish, called Birchermüesli. The most popular alcoholic drink in Switzerland is wine. Switzerland is notable for the variety of grapes grown because of the large variations in terroirs, with their specific mixes of soil, air, altitude and light. Swiss wine is produced mainly in Valais, Vaud (Lavaux), Geneva and Ticino, with a small majority of white wines. Vineyards have been cultivated in Switzerland since the Roman era, even though certain traces can be found of a more ancient origin. The most widespread varieties are the Chasselas (called Fendant in Valais) and Pinot noir. The Merlot is the main variety produced in Ticino.[266][267] See also Switzerland portal Europe portal Index of Switzerland-related articles Outline of Switzerland List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Europe Notes and references Notes ^ a b Bern is referred to as ""federal city"" (German: Bundesstadt, French: ville fédérale, Italian: città federale). Swiss law does not designate a capital as such, but the federal parliament and government are located in Bern, while the federal courts are located in other cities. ^ The original date of the Rütlischwur was 1307 (reported by Aegidius Tschudi in the 16th century) and is just one among several comparable treaties between more or less the same parties during that period. The date of the Federal Charter of 1291 was selected in 1891 for the official celebration of the ""Confederacy's 600th anniversary"". ^ A solemn declaration of the Tagsatzung declared the Federal Constitution adopted on 12 September 1848. A resolution of the Tagsatzung of 14 September 1848 specified that the powers of the institutions provided for by the 1815 Federal Treaty would expire at the time of the constitution of the Federal Council, which took place on 16 November 1848. ^ There are several definitions. See Geography of Switzerland#Western or Central Europe?. ^ Swiss Standard German spelling and pronunciation. The Swiss German name is sometimes spelled as Schwyz or Schwiiz [ˈʃʋiːt͡s]. Schwyz is also the standard German (and international) name of one of the Swiss cantons. ^ The latter is the common Sursilvan pronunciation. ^ As shown in this image, the current members of the council are (as of January 2016, from left to right): Federal Councillor Alain Berset, Federal Councillor Didier Burkhalter, Vice-President Doris Leuthard, President Johann Schneider-Ammann, Federal Councillor Ueli Maurer, Federal Councillor Simonetta Sommaruga, Federal Councillor Guy Parmelin and Federal Chancellor Corina Casanova ^ Since 1999, an initiative can also be in the form of a general proposal to be elaborated by Parliament, but because it is considered less attractive for various reasons, this form of initiative has yet to find any use. ^ That is a majority of 23 cantonal votes because the result of the popular vote in the six traditional half-cantons each counts as half the vote of one of the other cantons. ^ In 2008, the ETH Zürich was ranked 15th in the field Natural Sciences and Mathematics by the Shanghai Academic Ranking of World Universities and the EPFL in Lausanne was ranked 18th in the field Engineering/Technology and Computer Sciences by the same ranking. ^ Nobel prizes in non-science categories included.

Als 1848 ein politisch-administratives Zentrum für den neuen Bundesstaat zu bestimmen war, verzichteten die Verfassungsväter darauf, eine Hauptstadt der Schweiz zu bezeichnen und formulierten stattdessen in Artikel 108: «Alles, was sich auf den Sitz der Bundesbehörden bezieht, ist Gegenstand der Bundesgesetzgebung.» Die Bundesstadt ist also nicht mehr und nicht weniger als der Sitz der Bundesbehörden. ^ ""DSTAT-TAB - interactive tables (FSO): Demographic balance by citizenship"" (official statistics) (in English, German, French, and Italian).

Wie es um die Kundenzufriedenheit in der Branche generell steht, zeigt eine 2013 im Auftrag von «K-Tipp» durchgeführte repräsentative Umfrage unter Versicherten, die in den vergangenen zwei Jahren Leistungen von ihrer Krankenkasse in Anspruch genommen haben. Beim Testsieger Concordia waren rund 73% der Versicherten «sehr zufrieden». Bei grossen Krankenkassen wie der CSS und Helsana betrug dieser Anteil 70% beziehungsweise 63%. Groupe Mutuel erreichte rund 50%, und die Billigkasse Assura kam auf 44%. Dies illustriert, dass die Zufriedenheit durchaus hoch ist – dass es aber auch Potenzial für Effizienzsteigerungen bei Krankenkassen gibt. ^ ""Components of population change – Data, indicators: Deaths, mortality and life expectancy"".

UN Advocacy FAWCO is a United Nations-accredited non-governmental organization (NGO) with special consultative status with the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). FAWCO has representatives in New York, Geneva, Vienna, Athens and Bonn. FAWCO UN Reps are on the Boards of the NGO Committees on the Status of Women in New York, Geneva and Vienna, and the NGO Committee on Migration in New York. These representatives disseminate information about the UN and Agenda 2030 (the UN Sustainable Development Goals) to FAWCO members, attend UN meetings on behalf of FAWCO, and advocate to improve the lives of women and girls in the areas of education, environment, health, and human rights. The FAWCO UN Reps Team's mission is to: Inform the membership about UN priorities and programs. Encourage participation by Member Clubs in FAWCO's local and global NGO concerns. Coordinate and promote awareness among the Member Clubs on UN work in the areas of Education, Environment, Health, and Human Rights. Communicate UN news through the UN Liaison Bulletin, The FORUM and on FAWCO's website and social media. Advocate for projects and laws that directly affect gender equality and human rights. Represent FAWCO at UN meetings and conferences and on NGO Committees. Send FAWCO delegates to UN Commission on the Status of Women, UN Climate Conferences, Department of Global Communication conferences and meetings. Promote partnerships with other UN-affiliated NGOs. Endorse UN principles, recognizing the UN as a forum for the peaceful resolution of conflict. Arrange for speakers at FAWCO Conferences. Global Issues FAWCO's Resolutions and Recommendations for 2021-23 reinforce our commitment to improve the lives of women and girls worldwide, especially in the areas of education, the environment, health and human rights. Therefore, our Global Issues Teams focus on these four issues. Education: Keeping UN Sustainable Development Goal #4 (Quality Education) in mind, the mission of the Education Team is to increase members' awareness of global issues in education by focusing on the topics of global citizenship, literacy, equal access, and bridging the gap between school and employment, especially as they relate to women and girls, while highlighting educational action being taken by Member Clubs. Environment: The Environment Team informs members about global environmental issues including air, soil and water pollution, species extinction, energy efficiency, conservation, waste reduction, and climate change. The Team's efforts support UN Sustainable Development Goal #13 (Climate Action). Health: The Health Team provides information on issues related to women's health and aging, and works to achieve UN Sustainable Development Goal #3 (Good Health and Well-being). In 2014, the Team launched Clubs in Motion. Human Rights: The Human Rights Team keeps members aware of issues and new developments impacting women’s rights, contributes to UN Sustainable Development Goal #5 (Gender Equality), and engages FAWCO Member Clubs in awareness and action campaigns. The Target Program The Target Program offers opportunities for local FAWCO Clubs to make a global difference. The program: Follows a three-year cycle of issue awareness and education, project selection, fundraising, project monitoring, review and evaluation. Demonstrates the power of FAWCO Clubs working together toward a common goal. Increases knowledge and awareness of global issues affecting women. In keeping with FAWCO’s Resolutions and Recommendations, Target Programs have the overarching goal of improving the lives of women and girls. The FAWCO Board, in consultation with The FAWCO Foundation Board, chooses Target Issues on a revolving basis through our four areas of interest: Education, Environment, Health and Human Rights. Information about our current Target Program can be found in the Global Issues area of our website. The FAWCO Youth Program The FAWCO Youth Program was launched in 2013 at the Biennial Conference in Bern with the mission to promote cultural understanding and raise awareness of global issues in our youth and help them develop into responsible and caring global citizens. The Program includes Cultural Volunteers and Americana. The FAWCO Foundation The FAWCO Foundation has worked diligently and passionately to fulfill its purpose to implement the FAWCO's philanthropic concerns and interest in the global community, specifically by aiding charitable, scientific and educational programs, and by supporting the rights of women and children throughout the world. The Foundation continues to design and tailor programs to meet the ever-changing needs of the global community which it serves, and faces the future confident in its role as FAWCO's philanthropic heart. The FAWCO Foundation listens to your voice, the voice of the Member Clubs, and supports your projects, programs and passions. The FAWCO Foundation is your foundation. With clubs increasingly demonstrating interest in supporting long-term on-going projects, the administration R&D Fund was transferred to The FAWCO Foundation and became the Development Grants Program (DGs). Member Clubs may nominate two projects or programs in two different DG categories. DGs are projects and programs known by the nominating club and have mainly aided women and children in developing countries. Recipients are chosen by majority vote of the Member Clubs. The importance of fostering peace through knowledge and understanding and the belief that education is essential to developing peace-loving attitudes in children are cornerstones of The FAWCO Foundation Education Awards Program. The first FAWCO scholarship fund was created in 1935 when a member of AWC London donated $1000 a year for two years ""to launch two promising American candidates on their studies in Europe."" Today The FAWCO Foundation Education Awards Program offers annual awards to Club members and their children. FAUSA FAUSA–FAWCO Alumnae USA–is a vibrant and growing association of individuals who share the common experience of having lived abroad and who have returned to North America. Open to individuals and couples, many of whom were members of FAWCO Member Clubs while living abroad, FAUSA strives to facilitate the repatriation experience of its members by serving as a resource for information, helping them maintain their international ties, and providing an immediate social network. As the North American arm of FAWCO, FAUSA members and their children are eligible for Education Awards from The FAWCO Foundation and can participate in funding the awards, nominating a Development Grant, and supporting the FAWCO Target Programs. If you're interested in joining FAUSA, you can find out more information in the welcome letter. 02 July 2021 Sponsored Resource FAWCO News Who We Are Board Volunteers How We Work Mission Statement Resolutions & Recommendations History FAWCO Awards Support FAWCO FAWCO Calendar Conferences Upcoming Conference Past Conferences Regional Meetings Publications The FORUM Inspiring Women The Red Book Subscribe to Bulletins & E-Newsletters Annual Reports Publication Articles Media & Advertising P R & Media Advertise with Us Visit Our Partners Publications Annual Reports The FORUM Inspiring Women Subscribe Page The Red Book FAWCO Books Books by Clubs Books By Members The Red Book Media / Advertising PR & Media Advertise with Us Partners Pathways to Safety Overseas Vote Foundation FAWCO Foundation Education Awards Development Grants Conferences Upcoming Conference All Past Conferences Regional Meetings FAUSA Repatriation How-To Join FAUSA Extras Make a Donation to FAWCO Contact FAWCO Site Search Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Member Login Remember Me Log in Forgot Login?

The organizational score represents the degree to which the organization influencing climate policy and legislation. Corporations also have relationship scores reflecting their links with influencers like trade associations. Both are combined to place the corporation in a performance band. Full details can be found here. close E+ Performance Band 37% Organisation Score 25% Engagement Intensity Engagement Intensity The engagement intensity (EI) is a metric of the extent to which the company is engaging on climate change policy matters, whether positively or negatively. It is a number from 0 (no engagement at all) to 100 (full engagement on all queries/data points). Clearly energy companies are more affected by climate regulations and will have a higher EI than, for example retailers. So an organization’s score should be looked at in conjunction with this metric to gauge the amount of evidence we are using in each case as a basis for scoring. On our scale, an EI of more than 35 indicates a relatively large amount of climate policy engagement. close Modifications to InfluenceMap Scoring Relationship Score, December 2020 A new batch of industry associations has been uploaded onto the InfluenceMap system and the relationship scores recalculated accordingly. Updated terminology, February 2021 We adjusted the terminology used to describe the queries running down the left-hand side of our scoring matrix and added additional explanatory text to the info-boxes. This has no impact on the scores and methodology. It has been done following user feedback to improve clarity. close Sector: Utilities Head​quarters: 東京, 日本 Official Web Site: https://www.fepc.or.jp/english/ Wikipedia: Federation of Electric Power Companies Summary of InfluenceMap Scoring Climate Lobbying Overview: The Federation of Electric Power Companies (FEPC) has lobbied negatively on a number of climate change and energy regulations and policies in Japan, placing the S+3E strategy of the energy mix at the centre of its position on the energy mix. Top-line Messaging on Climate Policy: In 2021, through a position statement on its website, FEPC appear unsupportive of drastic emissions reductions, stating that the 2050 net zero target is extremely difficult for Japan to achieve due to its lack of domestic energy source and renewable energy infrastructure. Furthermore, it suggests that decarbonization will have a large impact on society and that countries without sufficient resources should be allowed to consider realistic steps to determine its own energy policy and mix. In 2019, FEPC appear to emphasize the lack of renewable technology and economic viability to meet emissions reductions as mandated by the Paris Agreement, through its online publication. In its press release published in 2020 on its website, FEPC appears to emphasize the need for innovative technology in addition to low carbon energy sources to achieve 2050 net zero emission which they suggest is 'Challenging'. The statement also states energy policy should encompass all aspects of Safety, Energy Security, Economic Efficiency and Environment (S+3E) while ensuring any climate change mitigation policy is compatible with the utilities sector. In a press release published 2021, they appear to communicate broad support towards increased GHG emission reduction, including increase in electrification, while also suggesting the need for technological development and innovation to achieve the 2050 net zero emission target. This position was also communicated through the Chair of FEPC in 2020, and again in 2021. In 2019, position statement through the Electric Power Council for a Low Carbon Society (ELCS), a committee established by FEPC, appear to state market-based response to CO2 reduction over government regulation for energy supply/demand in Japan and abroad, while advocating for voluntary measures by sectors to decarbonize. Engagement with Climate-Related Regulations: In 2019, FEPC attended the Subcommittee on the utilization of carbon pricing held by MoE, where their statement suggests that they do not support carbon pricing including carbon tax, indicating other measures including existing policies and industry’s voluntary activities are effective in decarbonization. This position seems consistent with the statement from 2017, where the Chair of the FEPC, Satoru Katsuno, stated concerns around carbon leakage and emissions trading at a press conference, suggesting decarbonization measures should be left to businesses’s own initiative. Positioning on Energy Transition: At a subcommittee on the utilization of carbon pricing, held by MoE in 2019, FEPC emphasized the cost of levy as a direct impact of the FIT scheme. FEPC has historically advocated in favour of retaining high GHG energy source in the energy mix, including in 2018 at MoE’s subcommittee meeting on Low carbon vision, advocating for coal to be kept in the energy mix, and again in 2019 at the Subcommittee on the utilization of carbon pricing. A statement published in 2018 on its website advocates for a prolonged role for coal through improving the efficiency of existing and newly build plants, and by combining it with gas. Since 2020 FEPC has been a member on the thermal coal power working group, hosted by METI. The meeting minutes indicate that FEPC has stated support for maintaining high efficiency coal plans while phasing out the inefficient plants. It has shown some support towards mandating a coal phaseout plan for individual companies, however has suggested provision of such information may compromise business competitiveness. In 2021, at METI’s Comprehensive Resources and Energy Study Group Basic Policy Subcommittee meeting, FEPC appear not to be supporting measures to ensure deployment of CCS for all coal power assets, suggesting those coal plants that cannot be fitted with CCS should be allowed to operate with the implementation of other negative emission measures, as a back-up to renewable energy. In the same meeting, they also appear to suggest that renewable energy target for 2030 should be considered in balance with the cost, as increasing the proportion of renewables in the energy mix will result in increase in energy prices and can have a negative impact on the electrification target for 2050. In 2021, through a position statement on its website, FEPC has indicated support for the long-term role for nuclear in the energy mix, however it is unclear as to how it sees it with regards to a full transition towards a zero-emission energy system. The chair’s interview in 2021 appear to reiterate this position on nuclear. Industry Association Governance: FEPC appears to have disclosed its board and company memberships. FEPC has only described its position on climate change policies in broad terms, without referencing specific policy items or describing engagement activities undertaken by the organization. It lacks a dedicated, clearly identifiable disclosure of its climate-relevant policy positions and lobbying activities. Details of Organization Score What do the 0,1,2 and NSs, NAs mean? Each cell in the organization's matrix presents a chance for us to assess each data source against our column of climate change policy queries. We score from -2 to 2, with negative scores representing evidence of obstructive influence. ""NA"" means ""not applicable"" and ""NS"" means ""not scored"" - that is we did not find any evidence either way. In both cases, the cell's weighting is re-distributed over others. Red and blue cells represent highly interesting negative or positive influence respectively.

V. is the leading organization of German industry and industry-related service providers. It represents 39 industry associations and more than 100,000 companies with around 8 million employees. Membership is voluntary. A total of 15 state representations represent the interests of the economy at the regional level. Headquarters of the BDI is in the Haus der Deutschen Wirtschaft (house of the German economy) in Berlin; Between 1950 and 1999 this was in the House of German Industry in Cologne. In addition, the BDI has other offices abroad and is therefore represented internationally. President of the BDI is since January 1, 2021 Siegfried Russwurm. As an umbrella organization, the federation is responsible for the perception and promotion of all concerns of the industries combined under the auspices of the BDI. However, this does not entitle it to represent social issues. This function is reserved for the Confederation of German Employers' Associations (BDA). The BDI statute limits the circle of members to leading industrial associations and working groups (§ 4, para. 2). As a result, sole proprietors or corporate networks can not obtain membership. From a political science point of view, the BDI has been described as an interest group in the association sectors ""Economy and Labor"" as well as ""an investor top association of industrial sector and trade associations"". As an advocacy group of the industry, the leading association operates interest articulation, following the process of forming an opinion within the association. The BDI lobbies globally in the sense of industrially active enterprises and is in ""all economic relevant legislative processes heard.""

European institutions to focus on the health and economic impacts of the COVID-19 crisis: BusinessEurope statement: Responsibility, Action and Solidarity is urgently required to protect businesses, society and our economyBusinessEurope message to the European Council The present coronavirus crisis has shifted the focus of our work to various other issues. Especially IVK has to react very quickly to fast-moving political initiatives and legislation and simultaneously re-organise co-operation digitally. This means the workload is high at the moment. With respect to the coronavirus crisis, I would like to share a letter from the German Branch of Business Europe (BDI) together with Business Europe sent yesterday to the European institutions see links below. In this letter, BDI and Business Europe call on the European institutions to concentrate all efforts on essential actions to mitigate the health and economic impacts of the COVID-19 crisis, putting on hold E.U. initiatives that could increase costs for companies or divert resources away from the fight against COVID-19, and to postpone non-essential public consultations at E.U. level. Citation from the letter to President Charles Michel: “The crisis comes at a moment where the European institutions are working out a series of important new initiatives in a wide range of policy fields. Overcoming the COVID-19 crisis will require the mobilisation of all energies and resources in a dramatic effort. It is unavoidable that the scope and timeframe of some of the new initiatives will be substantially affected by the unprecedented timeframe of some of the new initiatives will be substantially affected by the unprecedented challenges our societies and businesses are facing. Therefore, we urge you not to press on with these initiatives as if nothing has happened. A more comprehensive picture of the newly emerging situation and its consequences is required to determine how the new initiatives can be implemented. Avoiding additional burdens on enterprises is absolutely essential to make sure that as many businesses as possible survive and to allow our economy and society as a whole to recover more rapidly once the health crisis is overcome. Several member states have already clearly announced that they will focus on the essential and put other important initiatives on hold. For example, in France, President Macron announced that he would suspend ongoing discussions on pending reforms such as the pension reform. In Spain, the government decided to postpone a range of on-going initiatives which were Subject to public consultations. BusinessEurope calls on the European institutions to follow a similar approach and to concentrate all efforts on essential actions to mitigate the health and economic impacts of the COVID-19 crisis, putting on hold EU initiatives that could increase costs for companies or divert resources away from the fight against COVID-19 and postpone non-essential public consultations at EU level. Stakeholders face many practical difficulties to respond for practical reasons. Furthermore, the impact of the crisis means that there will be eventually a need for additional reflection on some proposals.” We at IVK also think that our industry will not be able to bear any significant additional costs as a side effect of new legislative initiatives (e.g. the planned microplastic restriction), and that this fact should be a strong argument in future discussions and advocacy. Therefore IVK strongly supports the BDI/Business Europe initiative and has asked FEICA to do the same.

159,"Policy advocacy - Wikipedia Policy advocacy From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Policy advocacy is defined as active, covert, or inadvertent support of a particular policy or class of policies.[1] Advocacy can include a variety of activities including, lobbying, litigation, public education, and forming relationships with parties of interest. Advocating for policy can take place from a local level to a state or federal government. For example, a local advocacy group in Brunswick, Georgia, Defenders of Wildlife, advocated for the passage of the H.R. 5552 Migratory Bird Protection Act during 2020 when rollbacks to the bill were introduced from the Trump Administration.[2] At the state level, advocacy for policy can be a joint effort between advocacy groups. In the United States, advocacy groups around the nation planned joint efforts to get the Uniform Partition of Heirs Property Act (UPHPA) signed into law in each of their respective states and in 2018, the bill was signed into law by Texas Governor Greg Abbott making it the tenth state to enforce this law.[3] Contents 1 Scientists as policy advocates 2 See also 3 References 4 External links Scientists as policy advocates[edit] Scientists, engineers, and other technical experts can act as advocates for their personal policy preferences and is very common in local, state, and federal governments to find scientists and engineers working on policy advocacy. For example, many non-profit groups with a focus on science policy and advocacy in the United States like the National Science Policy Network (NSPN) or Engineers and Scientists Acting Locally (ESAL) provide networks for all career stage professionals in STEM fields to engage in policy advocacy together. Other ways that STEM professionals can engage in policy advocacy can be seen as expert witnesses and panel speakers in the United States congressional committee meetings in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, many of which oversee scientific and technological topics such as the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology or the Senate committee on Energy and Natural Resources.[4] During these committee meetings, lawmakers will gather experts from both public and private sectors to provide insight into the issue at stake and why a policy should or should not be enacted.[5] See also[edit] Science policy Advocacy Advocacy groups References[edit] ^ Lackey (2007) ^ wwolfe@thebrunswicknews.com, WES WOLFE.

A joint venture between FICCI (51% equity), Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion (India) (34%) and State Governments of India (0.5% equity each),[27] Invest India was given a clearance by the Indian cabinet during September 2009 to set up under Section 25 of the Companies Act, 1956.[28] The initiative aims at speedy implementation of foreign investment projects in India and improving the climate for domestic investments.[29] Technology Commercialisation[edit] DRDO–FICCI Accelerated Technology Assessment and Commercialisation (ATAC) Programme[edit] DRDO and FICCI started the ATAC programme in February 2009 with an objective to create commercial linkages for DRDO technologies for use in civilian products and services.[30][31] The Explosives Detector Kit developed by DRDO is being commercialised under this initiative.[32] Bio-toilets based upon the bio-digester technology developed by DRDO is another such technology being commercialised under the program.[33] It is projected that DRDO will install 18000 bio-toilets across India in cooperation with various states, Union Territories, FICCI and Ganga Action Plan. Besides, over 10000 bio-digesters are being installed in passenger coaches of the Indian Rail.[34] Notable alumni[edit] Krishna Kumar Birla (1974–75)[35] Hari Shankar Singhania (1979–80)[36] R. P.

From a modest beginning with a few Member Organisations (MOs) from both Eastern and Western Europe, the FYEG has grown quite substantially. It now has 42 MOs from all the different regions of Europe. MOs vary in size, having from 70 to thousands of members. Organisations are comprised of the youth wings of Green Parties, student unions or environmental non-governmental youth organisations (youth NGOs). The FYEG secretariat is located in the same headquarters as the EGP, and once a year hosts its General Assembly, where MOs send delegates to decide on policy and strategy, and elect an Executive Committee. The Executive Committee board of nine people is elected to serve for a year and Executive Committee members can serve two terms consecutively. The Executive Committee leads and coordinates the activities of the Federation. There is no leadership hierarchy and we insist on having a flat structured and gender-balanced committee, although Executive Committee members do have individual areas of responsibility. They have been assisted by an elected full-time paid Secretary General. Together, they function in smaller teams to increase efficiency, but important decisions are made by the whole Executive Committee. Our opinions and statements are based on our political platform, which is discussed and updated each year during our General Assembly. By far, most our members are under 30, and all our events are planned and run by young unpaid activists from across Europe. We run a variety of activities over the span of a year with the objective of facilitating cooperation and mutual working between Member Organisations. We hold at least four major events annually which vary between meetings, seminars, study sessions, summer camps, political debates and training sessions. These are held in different parts of Europe where our members can meet, exchange views, broaden their horizons and find common cause with other Europeans, creating a real European sense of identity. The FYEG also organises International Campaigns such as; Climate, anti-TTIP, Reclaim Your Future, Reclaim Europe!, Youth, Election campaign for the European Union Elections, etc. Various methods are used in order to achieve our objectives. One of the most important is the spread of information. Ecosprinter is our journal which publicises our point of view and informs our activists of past and upcoming events. FYEG also have active email lists for different issues and different projects over the year. We regularly attend seminars and meetings organised by the European Commission, the Council of Europe, the European Youth Forum (of which we are full members), EGP (of which we are observers) and other partner organisations. This set-up realises FYEG's vision of empowering young people to play a part in European civil society rather than passively consuming events organised for them by adults. We want to develop a future Europe for young people and by young people with a number of opportunities to express themselves, based on environmental and social justice. During the last few years, we focused strongly on expanding our network toward Central and Eastern Europe. This is reflected in the full membership of organisations from the Czech Republic, Hungary, Serbia and Ukraine. A daughter organisation called Cooperation and Development Network Eastern Europe (CDN) was set up. In the future we aim to continue developing our network in the CEE region, in light of the enlargement and further European integration processes, and also focus on other networks and regions such as Euro-Med. We will also seek closer co-operation with other Green organisations outside Europe and also other international organisations. The FYEG is a functioning and active organisation, growing and becoming more dynamic and more effective. We are reaching out to new MOs and our MOs are becoming better organised, with our support. We will carry on supporting Europe and its Green future.

Its 38 member organisations comprise various backgrounds: local ecological groups, student unions, youth wings of Green parties and Green Youth NGOs. 16 July 2019 Share with friends: Tweet Share Share Print Please comment on the results of the elections to the European Parliament. The 2019 European election results were positively surprising, for a multitude of reasons. For one, the tendency of declining voter turnout at the European elections, a trend that we have observed since 1999, was reversed, as 50.62% of the EU electorate cast their ballots over the course of four days of elections. Voter turnout especially spiked in member states that joined during and following the 2004 large expansion, with Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Lithuania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Poland and Romania all registering the highest European election turnouts in their histories. It is therefore safe to say that the current European Parliament has great legitimacy and is the most representative Parliament of the EU’s population in the last 20 years based on sheer numbers in proportion to the population. Secondly, Green parties performed better than expected. The Greens gained unexpected seats in Austria, Denmark, Ireland, Portugal and the UK, while in France and Germany, the Greens achieved a higher percentage than previously projected, confirming that for a significant proportion of the electorate, these elections were climate elections. The Greens performed exceptionally well with the younger electorate, coming first among voters aged under 34 in France, and in Germany, the Greens had more votes among the electorate under the age of 30 than the Social Democrats, Liberals and Christian Conservatives combined. As a result, the Greens/EFA group, which is now officially the fourth largest group in the parliament, is the largest ever in terms of the number of MEPs within (75), and the outcome of these elections were the best results of the member parties of FYEG’s mother organisation, the European Green Party. We are especially happy and proud that four former FYEG spokespersons are now MEPs, one of them being the co-president of the Greens/EFA group, and that we have helped elect 7 MEPs under 35 to the European Parliament through our Young Candidates’ Platform. This success, of course, wouldn’t have been possible without the tireless work of climate activists and movements. Fridays For Future, Extinction Rebellion, the young people taking their states to court for not realising sufficiently ambitious climate targets and spokespersons of the climate movement in all European countries have contributed significantly to the fact that most voters prioritised concrete and immediate action against climate change and sustainability during the vote. It must also be noted, however, that the Green Wave did not cover Europe equally - while Western and Northern European Greens all have reason to celebrate, the breakthrough of the Greens in Central, Eastern and Southern European countries is yet to come, even though the climate movement has managed to thematise the elections in these regions as well. Looking at the bigger picture. it is also noteworthy that progressive and pro-European forces outperformed the often prophesied far right surge, while the status quo parties of Christian Democrats and Social Democrats both lost more than 30 seats in the European Parliament. What opportunities and challenges do you see? As Charles Dickens famously wrote in the Tale of Two Cities - it is the best of times and it is the worst of times. With the Greens surging towards the top in the West and the North, close attention, a significant amount of work and a new strategy will be required to revitalise the Green movement in the South and East of Europe. This work must begin now, as five years might sound like a long time, but in organisation--building and outreach, it might just be enough. The reinforced Greens/EFA group gives the Green family a remarkable responsibility. Europe is facing several crisis situations, from the immediate climate emergency, through the lack of access to social rights and a dignified way of life for an increasing number of people in Europe, particularly younger people, to the threats to democratic principles and the rule of law in multiple member states of the EU and beyond. With the spectre of Brexit looming over our heads, with Italy and the Commission at loggerheads over the country’s budget, with thousands drowning every week in the Mediterrainan, with trade deals being made with climate change deniers, with women’s rights being called into question yet again, with the democratisation of the selection process of the Commission suddenly disappearing without a trace, with anti-LGBTQI+ violence on the rise, and with certain member states actively working to weaken the political union, but happy to reap the benefits, while their citizens do not profit from them, the European project is facing perhaps its most turbulent time yet. However, any crisis also carries in itself the possibility to change and the opportunity to shape the outcome for the better. These situations require fundamental changes, thorough review and immediate attention and the Greens will be there at the forefront making sure that the outcomes are the best for both the people and the environment of Europe. What expectations do you have of the Green Group? Greens cannot and will not sit still and this is not the Europe that we envisioned and most certainly not the Europe our voters gave us a mandate to build. And with the most members the Group has ever had, it is a historic opportunity for Green legislators to work together with movements, civil society organisations, Green minded activists and youth organisations to bring about substantial change in how the EU functions and what its priorities are. That is why the Greens/EFA group entered into the majority negotiations with proposals on content, and to make sure our priorities are part of the political agenda for the next five years. With such a great legitimacy it is high time that Europe becomes the leading voice in the fight against climate change. We will work closely with the Group and especially our elected young MEPs to keep European political actors under tight scrutiny, and to deliver the socially just, sustainable, democratic, welcoming and inclusive Europe that we have promised to our supporters. > Back to the dossier < Tags European Parliament This post is licensed under: CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 Share with friends: Tweet Share Share Print 16 July 2019 © Heinrich-Böll-Stiftung e.V.

Since 2007, FYEG is the European Green Party's youth wing. FYEG has 29 member organisations, 7 candidates and one associate member, along with two partner organisations - the Global Young Greens and Cooperation and Development Network Eastern Europe.

Gerard Onesta was one of the founding members. The idea of a European federation was brought up in Strasbourg in 1988 by French, Belgian, Luxemburgish and German young members from Green parties. In 2002, during a FYEG General Assembly in Belgrade, the Cooperation and Development network (CDN) was founded, with the aim of better supporting green youth organisations in Eastern and South Eastern Europe, which were often smaller and organisationally less developed than their Western European counterparts. From then on, FYEG became more political and strengthened its links with the European Green Party (EGP) and European Youth Fourm (EYF). In 2007, it became EGP's official youth wing and gained voting rights in EGP's organs. In 2009, FYEG launched its first internal European campaign in order to promote young candidates at the European elections. Three MEPs, who were among the youngest ever, were elected to the European Parliament: Ska Keller, Jan Philipp Albrecht and Karima Delli. Similar programmes in subsequent elections have had equal success, with notable successes with Terry Reintke, Linnéa Engström, and Ernest Urtasun At the 2018 General Assembly, FYEG celebrated its 30th anniversary, and for the first time elected two female co-spokespeople: Zuzana Pavelková from Mladí zelení and Katri Ylinen, from ViNO. Katri Ylinen, FYEG Co-Spokesperson 2018-2019 Activities[edit] Like many other European Party-Political Youth Organisations, FYEG's main activities consist of lobbying its mother party within internal and external channels, engaging in broader European political discourse on topics relevant to it and its member organisations - notably migration and LGBTQ rights[2] - and organising international youth exchanges with EU and Council of Europe funding. These have included Study Sessions at the Council of Europe Youth Centres in Strasbourg and Budapest,[3] and summer camps and training sessions in various locations around Europe.[4] Structures[edit] General Assembly (GA)[edit] The General Assembly (GA) is the highest decision-making body of FYEG. All full member organisations have two votes in the GA, candidate member organisations have one vote and observer (partner) organisations can send observers. The General Assembly is held yearly in a different country. It is during the General Assembly that members of the different structures are elected. Executive Committee (EC)[edit] The executive committee is the second highest decision-making body in FYEG. It handles the management of the federation on a day-to-day basis. The EC is composed of 8 members. Within the EC, there are two co-spokespersons and a treasurer. The EC members are elected for one year and can renew their mandates three times. Finance Control Committee (FCC)[edit] The FCC's tasks include a yearly meeting, dedicated to checking FYEG's finances. A written report of this meeting must be submitted to the EC, thereby providing an internal audit and the presentation of this yearly report to the delegates at the GA. Members of the FCC are elected for two years by the GA. Advisory Committee (AC)[edit] The advisory Committee follows the functioning of the EC and personnel and they assist in conflict resolution between EC members and/or personnel. These are usually former EC members or people who were involved in FYEG. The Advisory Committee ensures the transfer of knowledge within FYEG and acts as a conflict resolution body. It is elected for two years at the GA and is composed of 5 members. Action by the AC is taken only upon request by EC members of other bodies of FYEG. They are elected for two years by the GA. Working groups[edit] The Working groups are a place for our activists to meet, debate topics and develop campaigns and ideas. They are in charge of building and communicating positions internally and externally with the approval of the EC. Each working group consist of at least 5 people from 5 different MOs. Office staff[edit] The office staff has at least one Secretary General (elected for two years by the General Assembly) and a Project Assistant. The Sec Gen is responsible of the daily management of FYEG regarding finances, co-ordination of the office, fund-raising, representation, reporting, networking and legal representation. The Project Assistant is in charge of project management, organisation of FYEG events and giving and administrative support to the SecGen.

Thirty-four Green parties from all over Europe have joined this new pan-European party. The Greens were the first to form a political party at European level. The other European political federations followed suit in the period 2004–06. For the Greens this was the culmination of a process which had started with the formation of a loose co-ordination 1979–93 and the EFGP 1993–2004.[2] 1979 to 1993[edit] Petra Kelly and Bram van der Lek In 1979, Daniel Brélaz became the world first green member of a national parliament (Switzerland). In 1979 the Coordination of European Green and Radical Parties (CEGRP) was set up to co-ordinate the participation of Green and Radical parties in the 1979 European Parliament election: There were considerable differences between the Green and Radical groups and the parties were unable to form a common pan-European electoral platform.[3] Although some parties polled well, no Green entered the European Parliament. In the 1984 election the Greens participated again. They held a congress in the spring of 1984 in Liège and set up a restructured European Green Coordination (EGC), with a secretariat provided by the Dutch Political Party of Radicals. They also issued a Joint Declaration of the European Green Parties. Furthermore, overall the member parties had grown stronger. Eleven MEPs of member parties were elected to the European Parliament.[a] They formed the Green Alternative European Link (GRAEL) in the European Parliament. The group was too small to be recognised by the Parliament for funds and committees and therefore it joined the Rainbow Group, which also encompassed regionalists, the Danish People's Movement against the European Community and some radicals and socialists. The European Greens formed a loose confederal triangular structure with the autonomous GRAEL in parliament, the weak EGC as a supra-national co-ordinating body and the member parties. The position of the European Greens was also weakened by the principle of rotation which some member parties (Germany and the Netherlands) used, with their MEPs being replaced by another after serving half their term. This rotation technique originated with the German Greens to prevent their members being co-opted by the informal negotiation system within the Bundestag,[4] but it served them badly within the European Parliament. For the Dutch parties, the choice for rotation was a compromise between three parties which had only two seats in parliament: one seat was kept by the top candidate while the second seat rotated between the second and the third candidate. This way each party would have a representative in the EP. Finally, there still was considerable diversity in the opinions of the Greens, especially between pro-European and Eurosceptic tendencies. These factors weakened the position of the Greens in Parliament. In the 1989 election the Green parties won 26 seats.[b] Because of political conflicts with the continuing Rainbow Group, the European Greens formed a separate parliamentary group, The Green Group in the European Parliament. During this period, the Greens became more entrenched in parliament. 1993 to 2004[edit] Dominique Voynet, Joschka Fischer and Pekka Haavisto. France, Germany and Finland had the first green ministers in a European government In June 1993 the European Federation of Green Parties was formed by the members of the EGC in Kirkkonummi, Finland. The organisation became more structured, it now had a triennial Congress, a Council and a Federation Committee (executive). It strengthened its ties with the Green Group in the European parliament. In the 1994 European elections Green parties won a total of 20 seats.[c] They were joined by a member of the Danish Socialist People's Party and one member of both the Italian South Tyrolean People's Party and The Network. Again the Greens formed a separate group from Rainbow Group, now renamed the European Radical Alliance. In the 1999 European elections the European Greens performed particularly well winning 38 seats.[d] They formed a combined group with the European Free Alliance, which represented regionalist parties and independence movements, which previously participated in the European Radical Alliance. The relationship between the Greens and these parties was different from before, as the Greens were stronger both numerically and politically. Since 2004[edit] Winfried Kretschmann, Minister-President of Baden-Württemberg; Femke Halsema, mayor of Amsterdam and Alexander Van der Bellen, President of Austria The European Green Party was founded at the Fourth Congress of the European Federation of Green Parties on 20–22 February 2004 in Rome, a party convention with over 1,000 delegates. Thirty-two Green parties from all over Europe joined this new pan-European party. The foundation of the new party was finalised with the signing of the treaty constituting the party in the Capitol of Rome. As such the Greens were the first to form a political party at European level, the other European federations followed suit between 2004 and 2006. In the 2004 European Parliament election the member parties won 35 Seats. In the 2009 European Parliament election, even though the European Parliament was reduced in size, the EGP member parties won 46 seats, the best result of the Green Parties in 30 years. In the 2014 European Parliament election the green candidates were José Bové and Ska Keller. The campaign was at a European level, Ska Keller participating in broadcast debates with the other candidates for the European Commission presidency. After the economic crisis, the green parties have consolidated its presence in the local and regional level. Green mayors as Éric Piolle in Grenoble or Fritz Kuhn in Stuttgart are good examples. Femke Halsema became the second green mayor of a European capital city, Amsterdam, after Francesco Rutelli (Rome). At the regional level, Winfried Kretschmann became President of Baden-Württemberg. Inés Sabanés and Célia Blauel are respectively members of the local governments of Madrid and Paris, being both responsible of the environment portfolio. Alexander Van der Bellen became the first green head of state in the world, representing Austria. The candidates for the 2019 European Parliament election, are Ska Keller and Bas Eickhout. In the year 2020 the European Greens achieves big gains in local elections throughout Europe, being elected green mayors in Lyon, Strasbourg, Besançon, Marseille or Bourdeaux among others in France and in capital city Dublin in Ireland as well as Aachen, Cologne or Bonn in Germany. Also green parties presence in national governments are the highest in history, being junior coalition parties in the governments of Sweden, Austria, Finland, Luxembourg, Belgium, Republic of Ireland, North Macedonia and Montenegro. Ideology and issues[edit] In 2017, the climate law is signed by Isabella Lövin, Deputy Prime Minister of Sweden The European Greens have committed themselves to the basic tenets of Green politics, such as environmental responsibility, individual freedom, inclusive democracy, diversity, social justice, gender equality, global sustainable development and non-violence.[5] However, its relationship to the European Union and its institutions has changed dramatically and is still the subject of a lively debate. In the 1970s and 1980s the European Greens were generally sceptical of European political and economic integration, which was seen as contrary to environmental and social interests. In its 1984 program, the European Greens advocated the formation of an alternative Europe, which would be neutral and decentralised. In 1989, some member parties adopted a more parliamentary course and became more supportive of European integration. The program advocates the democratisation of Europe's institutions. In their 1994 program, the Greens abandoned their principled opposition of European integration and began to propose pragmatic alternatives for the European Union's policies and institutions. The 1999 and 2004 programs also reflect this.[citation needed] In the area of Internet politics, the Greens–European Free Alliance (Greens/EFA) parliamentary group became famous for the strong support of a proposed Free Information Infrastructure, especially in their work on the directive against software patents in 2003.[citation needed] Nowadays the majority of the party is European federalist. Its former leader, Daniel Cohn-Bendit, is a member of the federalist The Spinelli Group, and has written with Guy Verhofstadt a book with a federalist manifesto purpose. The European Green Party affiliated to the European Movement International in February 2014.[6] Other prominent green members of The Spinelli Group are Monica Frassoni, Isabelle Durant and Joschka Fischer, a former Vice-Chancellor of Germany and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany).

Parties can also become associate member. Members of the Green Group not belonging to a member party can be admitted as a special member with speaking rights but no vote. Alice Bah Kuhnke, Deputy chairwoman of the Greens–European Free Alliance (Greens/EFA) group in the European Parliament. The governing bodies of the EGP are the Council and the Committee.[9] The Council consists of delegates of member parties. These are allotted on the basis of their most recent European or national election results. Each party has at least two delegates. The council is responsible for political affairs between congresses and it decides over organizational matters, such as the election of committee, the application of members and observers and the statutes of the EGP.[10] The Committee consists of nine members, including two spokespersons (one man and one woman), a secretary-general and a treasurer. They are responsible for daily political affairs, execution of the council's decisions and the activities of the EGP office and staff. The Congress is an enlarged meeting of the Council which is convened by the Council at least once every 5 years. The European Greens are organised in several regional networks. These are organised around seas, creating somewhat of a bioregional structure: such as the Green Islands Network (""a network for Green Parties in Britain, Ireland and associated islands""), the Baltic Sea Greens, the Green Mediterranean Network, Green Adriatic Network and the North Sea Greens. States with member parties  States with associate parties  States with candidate parties As of May 2018, the EGP comprises 37 (full) member parties, 4 associate member parties and 3 candidate member parties. These are listed in Annex B (pp. 22–23) of the respective Rule Book.[11] Membership[edit] Full members[edit] Country Name MEPs National MPs Government status Albania Green Party of Albania Not in EU 0 / 140 Extra-parliamentary Andorra Greens of Andorra Not in EU 0 / 28 Extra-parliamentary Austria The Greens – The Green Alternative 3 / 18 26 / 183 In government Belgium Flemish Groen 1 / 12[h] 8 / 102 [i] In government French German Ecolo 2 / 9 [j] 13 / 63 [k] In government Bulgaria The Greens 0 / 17 4 / 240 In opposition Cyprus Movement of Ecologists — Citizens' Cooperation 0 / 6 2 / 56 In opposition Czech Republic Green Party 0 / 22 0 / 200 Extra-parliamentary Denmark Socialist People's Party 2 / 13 15 / 179 Supporting government Estonia Estonian Greens 0 / 7 0 / 101 Extra-parliamentary Finland Green League 3 / 13 20 / 200 In government France Europe Ecology – The Greens 10 / 74 0 / 577 In opposition Georgia Green Party of Georgia Not in EU 0 / 150 Extra-parliamentary Germany Alliance 90/The Greens 21 / 96 67 / 709 In opposition Greece Ecologist Greens 0 / 21 0 / 300 Extra-parliamentary Hungary LMP – Hungary's Green Party 1 / 21 8 / 199 In opposition Ireland Green Party[l] 2 / 13 12 / 160 In government Italy Federation of the Greens 0 / 73 0 / 630 Extra-parliamentary South Tyrol Greens 0 / 73 0 / 630 Extra-parliamentary Luxembourg The Greens 1 / 6 6 / 60 In government Malta AD+PD 0 / 6 0 / 67 Extra-parliamentary Moldova Ecologist Green Party Not in EU 0 / 101 Extra-parliamentary Netherlands GroenLinks 3 / 26 8 / 150 In opposition North Macedonia Democratic Renewal of Macedonia Not in EU 1 / 120 In government Norway Green Party Not in EU 1 / 169 In opposition Poland The Greens 1 / 51 3 / 460 In opposition Portugal Ecologist Party ""The Greens"" 0 / 21 2 / 230 In opposition Romania Green Party 0 / 32 0 / 329 Extra-parliamentary Slovenia Youth Party – European Greens 0 / 8 0 / 90 Extra-parliamentary Spain Equo 0 / 54 1 / 350 In opposition Catalonia Esquerra Verda[m] 1 / 54 2 / 350 In government Catalunya en Comú 1 / 54 7 / 350 In government Sweden Green Party 3 / 20 16 / 349[12] In government Switzerland Green Party of Switzerland Not in EU 28 / 200 In opposition Ukraine Party of Greens of Ukraine Not in EU 0 / 450 Extra-parliamentary United Kingdom England Wales Green Party of England and Wales Not in EU 1 / 573 [n] In opposition Scotland Scottish Greens 0 / 59 [o] Extra-parliamentary Northern Ireland Green Party in Northern Ireland [p] 0 / 18 [q] Extra-parliamentary Werner Kogler, Vice-Chancellor of Austria Dritan Abazović, Deputy Prime Minister of Montenegro Eamon Ryan, Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications & Transport of Ireland Candidate members[edit] Country Name MEPs National MPs Croatia Sustainable Development of Croatia – – Montenegro United Reform Action Not in EU 3 / 81 Turkey Green Left Party Not in EU – sources[13][14] Associate members[edit] Country Name MEPs National MPs Belarus Belarusian Party ""The Greens"" Not in EU 0 / 110 Croatia We can! – Political Platform – 5 / 151 Russia Green Alternative[15] Not in EU 0 / 170 sources[13] Applicants[edit] Country or region Name (in English) MEPs National MPs Serbia Greens of Serbia Not in EU 2 / 250 Former members[edit] Former full members[edit] Green Pro-European demonstration in Rome, 2017 Federation of Young European Greens demonstration in Copenhagen during the Climate Summit 2009 De Grønne from Denmark were expelled from the EGP in 2008. The reason was that De Grønne intended to co-operate with the People's Movement against the EU in the upcoming 2009 European elections, a national party which sits with the European United Left–Nordic Green Left parliamentary group instead of the Greens–European Free Alliance. The party was disbanded in 2014. On 13 May 2012, the Council of the EGP withdrew the membership of Confederation of the Greens (Los Verdes) from Spain,[16] after several months of negotiations, and mainly because 13 out of 16 parties (formerly within the Confederation of the Greens) decided to join EQUO. The Green Left from Hungary withdrew its membership on 7 September 2015 because of financial reasons. They disbanded in 2018. On 10 November 2019, the Latvian Green Party was expelled from the EGP, due to its nationalist, anti-LGBT and anti-immigration views.[17] The Greens from the Netherlands withdrew the EGP in 2017.[18] Country Year left Name MEPs (current) National MPs (current) Denmark 2012 De Grønne n/a - defunct Hungary 2015 Green Left n/a - defunct Latvia 2019 Latvian Green Party - 6 / 100 Netherlands 2017 The Greens - - Russia 2016[r] Green Alternative [s] Not in EU - Spain 2012 Confederation of the Greens - - Former associate members[edit] Country Name MEPs (current) National MPs (current) Azerbaijan Green Party of Azerbaijan Not in EU n/a - defunct Russia Union of Greens of Russia Not in EU n/a - defunct Networks[edit] The EGP hosts a collection of networks that have specific special interest focus, including: Federation of Young European Greens, a federation of European Green youth organisations European Network of Green Seniors EGP Gender Network European Queer Greens Elected representatives of member parties[edit] European institutions[edit] Organisation Institution Number of seats European Union European Commission 0 / 28 European Council(Heads of Government) 0 / 28 Council of the European Union(Participation in Government) 6 / 27 European Parliament 52 / 751 Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly 3 / 318 See also[edit] Environment portal Accumulation by dispossession Alter-globalization Anthropological theories of value Anti-nuclear movement Club of Rome Common good (economics) Communalism Ecofeminism Ecological economics Environmental movement Ethics of care Green politics List of environmental organisations Low-carbon economy Open-source model Participatory economics Political ecology Post-capitalism Post-consumerism Post-growth Post-scarcity economy Queer ecology Rural flight Simple living Tobin tax Universal Basic Income Via Campesina Notes[edit] ^ 7 for the German Greens, 1 for the Dutch Political Party of Radicals, 1 for the Dutch Pacifist Socialist Party, an ally of the PPR, 1 for Ecolo and 1 for Agalev ^ 7 for the German Greens, 8 for French Greens, 2 for the Dutch GreenLeft, 2 for Ecolo and 1 for Agalev, 1 for the Spanish IP, 2 for the Italian Rainbow Greens and 2 for the Italian Green Lists ^ 12 for the German Greens, 1 for the Dutch GreenLeft, 1 for Ecolo and 1 for Agalev, 1 for the Luxembourgish The Greens IP, 2 for the Italian Federation of the Greens and 2 for the Green Party ^ 7 for the German Alliance '90/The Greens, 4 for the Dutch GreenLeft, 3 for Ecolo and 2 for Agalev, 1 for the Luxembourgish The Greens, 2 for the Italian Federation of the Greens, 2 for the Green Party, 9 for The Greens of France, 2 for the Austrian Greens, 2 for the Finnish Green League, 2 for the Swedish Green Party and 2 for the Green Party of England and Wales ^ Michaele Schreyer for Alliance '90/The Greens ^ includes 6 independent MEPs elected for the Europe Écologie group ^ Includes 14 MEPs, from 8 countries, NOT affiliated with EGP member parties. ^ Dutch-speaking electoral college ^ Flemish seats in the Belgian Chamber of Representatives, including seats for bilingual Brussels. ^ All seats for the French and German-speaking electoral colleges. ^ All seats for French and German-speaking Communities in the Belgian Chamber of Representatives, including seats for bilingual Brussels. ^ The Irish Green Party operates also in Northern Ireland as the ""Green Party in Northern Ireland"".

It also known as the sea fir and Neptune plant. These so-called ""ferns"" are dead and dried colonies of hydrozoans, colonies of marine hydroids, class Hydrozoa, phylum Cnidaria. Hydroids are related to corals and jellyfish. These dried hydroid colonies are commonly sold as a curiosity, as a decorative ""indoor plant"", or as underwater decorations for aquaria in stores. They are sometimes labeled as ""Neptune plants"". Despite a superficial resemblance to plants, they are actually animal skeletons or shells. The dried colonies are often dyed green, but, when soaked in water, the coloring will dissolve. An air fern on display The fernlike branches of S. argentea are composed of many small, chitinous chambers where individual animals once lived. When the colony was alive, a polyp with numerous tentacles occupied each of the chambers, called hydrotheca. Sometimes dried bryozoa are sold as ""air ferns.""[1] Most commercially sold air ferns are collected as a by-product by trawlers in the North Sea. References[edit] ^ Frank K. McKinney.

171,"Fern spike - Wikipedia Fern spike From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search The geologically-rapid increase in fern abundance after extinction events Succession of an ecosystem following disturbance, in the form of a fern spike. In paleontology, a fern spike is the occurrence of unusually high spore abundance of ferns in the fossil record, usually immediately (in a geological sense) after an extinction event. The spikes are believed to represent a large, temporary increase in the number of ferns relative to other terrestrial plants after the extinction or thinning of the latter. Fern spikes are strongly associated with the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event,[1][2] although they have been found in other points of time and space such as at the Triassic-Jurassic boundary.[3][4] Outside the fossil record, fern spikes have been observed to occur in response to local extinction events, such as the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption.[5] Contents 1 Causes 1.1 Spore characteristics 1.2 Environmental tolerance 1.3 Ecology 1.4 Spore availability 2 Detection 3 Significance 4 Known events 5 See also 6 References Causes[edit] Extinction events have historically been caused by massive environmental disturbances, such as meteor strikes. Volcanic eruptions can also wipe out local ecosystems through pyroclastic flows and landslides, leaving the ground bare for new colonization.[6] For a population to recover and thrive after such an event, it must be able to tolerate the conditions of the disturbed environment. Ferns have multiple characteristics which predispose them to grow in those environments. Spore characteristics[edit] Plants generally reproduce with spores or seeds, meaning those will be what germinates in a disaster's aftermath. But spores have advantages over seeds in the environmental conditions produced by a disaster. They're generally produced in higher numbers than seeds, and are smaller, aiding wind dispersal.[6] While many wind-dispersed pollens of seed plants are smaller and farther dispersed than spores,[7] pollen cannot germinate into a plant and must land in a receptive flower. Some seed plants also require animals to disperse their seeds, which may not be present after a disaster. These characteristics allow ferns to rapidly colonize an area with their spores. Fern spores require light to germinate.[8] Following major disturbances that clear or reduce plant life, the ground would receive ample sunlight that may promote spore germination. Some species' spores contain chlorophyll, which hastens germination and may aid rapid colonization of clear ground.[9] Environmental tolerance[edit] After the eruption of El Chichón, the fern Pityrogramma calomelanos was observed to regenerate from rhizomes buried by ash, even though the plants' leaves were destroyed.[6] The rhizomes tolerated exposure to heat and sulfur from the volcanic matter. Their survival suggests resilience of ferns to the harsh environmental conditions imposed by certain kinds of disasters, and rhizome regeneration may have been a factor in fern recovery after other environmental events. Ecology[edit] Fern spikes follow the pattern of ecological succession. In the past and in modern times, ferns have been observed to act as pioneer species.[5] Eventually, their abundance at a site decreases as other plants such as gymnosperms begin to grow.[2] Spore availability[edit] Fern spikes cannot occur without ferns already existing in the area, so spikes occur primarily in regions where ferns are already a prominent part of the ecosystem. At the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event, a fern spike occurred in the New Zealand area, where ferns made up 25% of plant abundance pre-extinction. After the event, fern abundance increased to 90%.[2] Detection[edit] Prehistoric fern spikes can be detected by sampling sediment. Sources include sediment that has been accumulating in a lake since the event of interest and sedimentary rocks such as sandstone.[5] Because sediment accumulates over time and thus shows superposition, layers can be assigned to certain times. Spore concentration in a layer can be compared to the concentration at different times, and concentration of other particles such a pollen grains. A fern spike is characterized by a suddenly higher abundance of fern spores following a disaster, generally accompanied by a decrease in other plant species as indicated by their pollen. Eventually fern abundance will decrease, hence the term ""spike"" describing the pattern. Modern fern spikes can simply be directly observed, and allow for observation of factors contributing to the spike that may not be detectable otherwise, such as rhizomes persisting in ash.[6] Significance[edit] Because fern spikes generally coincide with certain disasters such as meteorite strikes and volcanic eruptions, their presence in the fossil record can indicate those events. A fern spike is believed to support a meteorite impact as cause of the Triassic-Jurassic extinction event, similar to the one later causing extinction at the end of the Cretaceous period.[3] Known events[edit] A fern spike followed a fungal spike after the Permian–Triassic extinction event (252 Ma). It has been observed in Australia.[10] After the Triassic-Jurassic extinction event (201.3 Ma), ferns drastically increased in abundance while seed plants became scarce. The spike has been detected in eastern North America and Europe.[3][11] A very widespread fern spike occurred after the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event (66 Ma).[2] The spike has been predominantly observed in North America, with just one observance outside the continent in Japan.[1] Fern spikes today are often observed after volcanic eruptions. The areas affected by the eruptions of Mount St. Helens (May 18, 1980) and El Chichón (March—April 1982) exhibited such a pattern.[5][6] See also[edit] Ecological succession Paleoecology Pioneer species References[edit] ^ a b Schultz, P.

Most species of ferns are homosporous (producing only one kind of spore). The haploid spore grows into a small, usually flat gametophyte known as a prothallus, which is undifferentiated into roots, stems, and leaves. The green prothallus anchors itself with hairlike extensions known as rhizoids and bears both archegonia (organs producing female gametes) and antheridia (organs producing male gametes). The male gametes require the presence of water to swim to the female gametes and fertilize the eggs. Normally only one embryo is produced, and it then grows out of the gametophyte plant as a diploid sporophyte plant that has roots, stems, and leaves and conducts photosynthesis, while the smaller gametophyte withers away. The leaves of these sporophytes eventually produce sporangia (in some species occurring in clusters known as sori). Under dry conditions, the sori burst releasing hundreds of thousands or millions of spores. Ferns were abundant in the Carboniferous period and exist today in about 11,000 species, about three-quarters of which live in tropical climates.The American Heritage® Science Dictionary Copyright © 2011.

They also have a specialized non-lignified tissue (the phloem) to conduct products of photosynthesis. Vascular plants include the clubmosses, horsetails, ferns, gymnosperms (including conifers) and angiosperms (flowering plants). Scientific names for the group include Tracheophyta,[6][4]:251 Tracheobionta[7] and Equisetopsida sensu lato. Some early land plants (the rhyniophytes) had less developed vascular tissue; the term eutracheophyte has been used for all other vascular plants. Contents 1 Characteristics 2 Phylogeny 3 Nutrient distribution 3.1 Transpiration 3.2 Absorption 3.3 Conduction 4 See also 5 References 6 Bibliography 7 External links Characteristics[edit] Botanists define vascular plants by three primary characteristics: Vascular plants have vascular tissues which distribute resources through the plant. Two kinds of vascular tissue occur in plants: xylem and phloem. Phloem and xylem are closely associated with one another and are typically located immediately adjacent to each other in the plant. The combination of one xylem and one phloem strand adjacent to each other is known as a vascular bundle.[8] The evolution of vascular tissue in plants allowed them to evolve to larger sizes than non-vascular plants, which lack these specialized conducting tissues and are thereby restricted to relatively small sizes. In vascular plants, the principal generation phase is the sporophyte, which produces spores and is diploid (having two sets of chromosomes per cell). (By contrast, the principal generation phase in non-vascular plants is the gametophyte, which produces gametes and is haploid - with one set of chromosomes per cell.) Vascular plants have true roots, leaves, and stems, even if some groups have secondarily lost one or more of these traits. Cavalier-Smith (1998) treated the Tracheophyta as a phylum or botanical division encompassing two of these characteristics defined by the Latin phrase ""facies diploida xylem et phloem instructa"" (diploid phase with xylem and phloem).[4]:251 One possible mechanism for the presumed evolution from emphasis on haploid generation to emphasis on diploid generation is the greater efficiency in spore dispersal with more complex diploid structures. Elaboration of the spore stalk enabled the production of more spores and the development of the ability to release them higher and to broadcast them farther. Such developments may include more photosynthetic area for the spore-bearing structure, the ability to grow independent roots, woody structure for support, and more branching.[citation needed] Phylogeny[edit] A proposed phylogeny of the vascular plants after Kenrick and Crane 1997[9] is as follows, with modification to the gymnosperms from Christenhusz et al. (2011a),[10] Pteridophyta from Smith et al.[11] and lycophytes and ferns by Christenhusz et al. (2011b) [12] The cladogram distinguishes the rhyniophytes from the ""true"" tracheophytes, the eutracheophytes.[9] Polysporangiates Tracheophytes Eutracheophytes Euphyllophytina Lignophytes Spermatophytes †Pteridospermatophyta (seed ferns) Cycadophyta (cycads) Pinophyta (conifers) Ginkgophyta (ginkgo) Gnetophyta Magnoliophyta (flowering plants) †Progymnospermophyta Pteridophyta Pteridopsida (true ferns) Marattiopsida Equisetopsida (horsetails) Psilotopsida (whisk ferns & adders'-tongues) †Cladoxylopsida Lycophytina Lycopodiophyta †Zosterophyllophyta †Rhyniophyta †Aglaophyton †Horneophytopsida Gymnosperms This phylogeny is supported by several molecular studies.[11][13][14] Other researchers state that taking fossils into account leads to different conclusions, for example that the ferns (Pteridophyta) are not monophyletic.[15] Hao and Xue presented an alternative phylogeny in 2013 for pre-euphyllophyte plants.[16] Polysporangiophytes †Horneophytaceae Tracheophytes †Cooksoniaceae †Aglaophyton †Rhyniopsida †Catenalis †Aberlemnia †Hsuaceae †Renaliaceae Eutracheophytes †Adoketophyton †?Barinophytopsida †Zosterophyllopsida Microphylls †Hicklingia †Gumuia †Nothia †Zosterophyllum deciduum Lycopodiopsida †Yunia Euphyllophytes †Eophyllophyton †Trimerophytopsida Megaphylls Moniliformopses †Ibyka †Pauthecophyton †Cladoxylopsida Polypodiopsida Radiatopses †Celatheca †Pertica Lignophytes †Progymnosperms(paraphyletic) Spermatophytes Rhyniopsids Renalioids Nutrient distribution[edit] Photographs showing xylem elements in the shoot of a fig tree (Ficus alba): crushed in hydrochloric acid, between slides and cover slips. Water and nutrients in the form of inorganic solutes are drawn up from the soil by the roots and transported throughout the plant by the xylem. Organic compounds such as sucrose produced by photosynthesis in leaves are distributed by the phloem sieve tube elements. The xylem consists of vessels in flowering plants and tracheids in other vascular plants, which are dead hard-walled hollow cells arranged to form files of tubes that function in water transport. A tracheid cell wall usually contains the polymer lignin. The phloem, however, consists of living cells called sieve-tube members. Between the sieve-tube members are sieve plates, which have pores to allow molecules to pass through. Sieve-tube members lack such organs as nuclei or ribosomes, but cells next to them, the companion cells, function to keep the sieve-tube members alive. Transpiration[edit] The most abundant compound in all plants, as in all cellular organisms, is water, which serves an important structural role and a vital role in plant metabolism. Transpiration is the main process of water movement within plant tissues. Water is constantly transpired from the plant through its stomata to the atmosphere and replaced by soil water taken up by the roots. The movement of water out of the leaf stomata creates a transpiration pull or tension in the water column in the xylem vessels or tracheids. The pull is the result of water surface tension within the cell walls of the mesophyll cells, from the surfaces of which evaporation takes place when the stomata are open. Hydrogen bonds exist between water molecules, causing them to line up; as the molecules at the top of the plant evaporate, each pulls the next one up to replace it, which in turn pulls on the next one in line. The draw of water upwards may be entirely passive and can be assisted by the movement of water into the roots via osmosis. Consequently, transpiration requires very little energy to be used by the plant. Transpiration assists the plant in absorbing nutrients from the soil as soluble salts. Absorption[edit] Living root cells passively absorb water in the absence of transpiration pull via osmosis creating root pressure. It is possible for there to be no evapotranspiration and therefore no pull of water towards the shoots and leaves. This is usually due to high temperatures, high humidity, darkness or drought.[citation needed] Conduction[edit] Xylem and phloem tissues are involved in the conduction processes within plants. Sugars are conducted throughout the plant in the phloem, water and other nutrients through the xylem. Conduction occurs from a source to a sink for each separate nutrient. Sugars are produced in the leaves (a source) by photosynthesis and transported to the growing shoots and roots (sinks) for use in growth, cellular respiration or storage. Minerals are absorbed in the roots (a source) and transported to the shoots to allow cell division and growth.[17] See also[edit] Fern allies Bryophytes Non-vascular plant Pteridophyte References[edit] ^ D.

The BNP Paribas Stiftung Deutschland supports a wide range of educational and cultural projects within non-profit organisations, which all work towards improving young peoples’ opportunities. Responsibility and commitment to society are deeply rooted at BNP Paribas.” Dirk-Michael Mitter Chairman of the Foundation Council The BNP Paribas Group’s foundation in Germany was founded in 2015. It supports educational, art and culture projects throughout the country. In doing so, it specifically supports children and young people who have to overcome hurdles and barriers in their own personal biography, for example as a result of social disadvantage, disability or a migration or refugee background. As a foundation of a globally active banking group, the BNP Paribas Foundation promotes the guiding principle of international dialogue. The projects that it supports bring young people with different backgrounds and origins together – thus contributing to intercultural understanding and solidarity. All children and young people should be given equal opportunities to discover their own strengths and talents to be able to develop and evolve in the best possible way.

Dans ce sens, la Fondation poursuivra cet été son opération #b7arblaplastic » lancée en 2019 et qui a été un véritable succès grâce à l’engagement des partenaires et à la motivation des participants. L’opération a reçu en 2020 la distinction de la meilleure bonne pratique d’éducation à l’environnement sur les 4425 plages labellisées Pavillon bleu dans le monde, indique la Fondation dans un communiqué. Alors que les Marocains ont retrouvé le chemin des plages dans le respect des mesures sanitaires encore en vigueur, comme la distanciation sociale, les gestes barrières, le port du masque, la Fondation compte axer sa campagne sur les 105 plages de son programme Plages Propres. Pour l’été 2021, cette opération de sensibilisation reprendra les trois temps forts de la première édition, à savoir la mobilisation d’un million de jeunes sur la période estivale et le déploiement de 10.000 actions de sensibilisation et d’éducation au développement durable auprès d’eux. L’opération prévoit aussi la récupération de 10 tonnes de plastique par plage pendant la période estivale, précise la Fondation, qui réitère sa mobilisation pour les plages, le littoral, les mers et les océans, dont le rôle pour la préservation du climat est capital. Pour ce faire, des associations de plongée s’activeront pour sensibiliser les jeunes des programmes Eco-Ecoles, Jeunes Reporters pour l’Environnement et du Réseau des Universités vertes aux déchets plastiques dans les fonds marins. Des jeux concours et des défis virtuels mobiliseront les jeunes autour de l’opération #b7arblaplastic”. Cette année, les déchets plastiques collectés sur les plages seront recyclés dans des unités de recyclage qui se sont portées volontaires pour cette opération. L’opération #b7arblaplastic, action remarquable de sensibilisation, vient d’être inscrite à la Décennie pour les Sciences océaniques au service du Développement Durable (2021-2030) lancée par la Commission Océanographique Intergouvernementale (COI) de l’UNESCO et que la Fondation a rejoint comme membre fondateur de l’alliance qui la pilote dans le monde, conclut la même source.

Selon un communiqué de la Fondation, membre fondateur de l’alliance de l’Océan, lesdites conférences, dont la première a eu lieu fin juin, visent à partager les objectifs de la décennie, lancée en février 2021 par la COI, avec les citoyens, notamment les plus jeunes, les associations, les entreprises, les organisations et les administrations. Dans ce sens, des journalistes animent les discussions avec des experts nationaux et internationaux et ""veillent à ce que leurs propos restent toujours compréhensibles à tous"", précise le communiqué.Sur le terrain, la Fondation se mobilise dans le cadre de son programme Plages Propres et #bharblaplastic, a fait savoir la même source, ajoutant que cette opération de sensibilisation, récompensée en 2020 par l'écolabel Pavillon Bleu comme meilleure pratique de sensibilisation dans le monde, a été intégrée dans la Décennie des sciences océaniques au service du développement durable. L'opération #bharblaplastic, qui consiste à collecter des déchets plastiques dans les 105 plages du programme Plages Propres, ""permet de se rendre compte de la réalité de cette menace grandissante"", a expliqué la Fondation. Elle propose également des solutions en apprenant aux participants à réduire leur utilisation de plastique et en recyclant les déchets plastiques collectés, selon les principes d’une économie circulaire, a poursuivi la même source. La Décennie des sciences océaniques au service du développement durable a pour objectifs de créer des océans propres où les sources de pollution sont recensées et réduites ou éliminées, des océans sains et résilients où les écosystèmes marins sont bien connus, protégés, restaurés et gérés.Cette décennie aspire à des océans productifs qui permettent un approvisionnement alimentaire et une économie océanique durable, des océans prévisibles dont l’évolution est comprise par une société capable de s’y adapter, des océans sûrs où la vie et les moyens de subsistance sont protégés des aléas liés à ces milieux.La communauté internationale s'attend aussi à des océans à portée de tous grâce à un accès libre et équitable aux données, à l’information ainsi qu’à la technologie et l’innovation, et à des océans inspirants et attrayants dont le fonctionnement et la valeur au regard du bien-être et du développement durable sont compris par la société.""La connaissance, la compréhension et le partage de ces sept objectifs sont indispensables à la sauvegarde des océans menacés, alors qu'ils jouent un rôle essentiel dans la régulation du climat"", a conclu la Fondation. -MAP-08/07/2021 All rights reserved 2021 Réalisé par Agence web Fornet › Accueil › Activités Royales › Activités Princières › Discours de Sa Majesté › Actualités › Emploi public › Marchés publics › Plan du site › Contactez-nous",Fondation Mohammed VI pour la Protection de l’Environnement

La composition du Conseil comprend des opérateurs publics et privés. La FM6E est dotée d’un organigramme fonctionnel avec un président délégué, nommé par Sa Majesté le Roi Mohammed VI en Juin 2001.Si la préservation de l’Environnement est admise aujourd’hui comme moteur de croissance pour tous les pays dans le monde, elle l’est tout particulièrement pour Le Maroc, véritable coffre fort de richesses naturelles dont l’attractivité a fait du secteur touristique, un des piliers de l’Economie Nationale. Absolument consciente qu’un pan du Patrimoine écologique du pays est menacé et que tous ont la nécessité de faire face à un défi sans précédent sous peine d’obérer le développement futur, la Fondation Mohammed VI pour la Protection de l’Environnement sous la présidence effective de Son Altesse Royale La Princesse Lalla Hasnaa, a initié une démarche de prise de conscience et de responsabilisation partagée, impliquant tous les acteurs potentiels du Changement sous la bannière: TOUS POUR L'ENVIRONNEMENTCette démarche a comme substrat trois piliers : Le partage de l’engagement Une stratégie pour le développement durable L’Education des plus jeunes Elle vise à: Impliquer les acteurs (ONG, sponsors, collectivités, administrations publiques) Créer un mouvement de mobilisation de toutes les strates de la Société Pérenniser toute action initiée, sur le long terme La FM6E a inscrit ses actions dans le cadre de partenariats conventionnels avec l’ensemble des intervenants publics et privés.Dés l’année 2000, lors d’un colloque, Villes, Campagnes, Forêts et Plages, Son Altesse Royale, la Princesse Lalla Hasnaa avait souligné: «La sauvegarde de l’Environnement est aussi une affaire de comportement. L’Education a donc un rôle décisif à jouer pour aider à éveiller les consciences.» Toutes les actions éducatives de la FM6E vont tendre à sensibiliser les plus jeunes d’entre nous à l’importance de l’écologie pour en faire les Citoyens du 21ème Siècle, des Patriotes de l’Environnement.Ils devront grandir avec le crédo que les Biens Environnementaux constituent une ressource rare au prix très élevé. Ce prix est celui de notre bien être, de notre santé et de notre développement économique futur.Une approche méthodologique précisePour penser le futur, en préalable à toute forme d’action, cette approche est concrétisée par des recherches, colloques, partenariats, conventions internationales, transferts de compétences et d’expériences, enquêtes.Elle aboutit à l’élaboration de nombreux programmes, avec indicateurs de résultats. Une approche écologique du développement.Dans la nécessité de propager la seule vision d’avenir possible pour le Développement Humain, celle d’une approche écologique du développement, la FM6E travaille à l’élaboration de nouveaux paramètres de Comptabilité économique et sociale. Ces instruments économiques pour équilibrer impératifs de croissance et protection de l’environnement, valoriseront les biens publics environnementaux. Cette vision nouvelle inclura pour l’avenir, une analyse de la contribution des éco systèmes locaux à l’activité économique et au bien être des populations tant par leurs ressources directes que par leurs qualités paysagères et touristiques. Des actions de fond engagées et soutenues sur le long terme. Protéger et préserver les ressources naturelles, le patrimoine côtier et forestier. Accompagner la Recherche pour favoriser le développement des ressources alternatives, eau, énergie, innovation de produits propres, de process et d’industries propres. Dans cet esprit, la FM6E associe les acteurs locaux pour l’identification, la programmation et la réalisation des projets environnementaux ayant un impact direct sur la vie de la population..

La présidence en a été confiée dès le départ à SAR la Princesse Lalla Hasnaa. La mission fondamentale de la Fondation est la sensibilisation et l’éducation au développement durable. Dans cette mission, la Fondation s’adresse à tous les publics, depuis les écoliers jusqu’aux décideurs politiques et économiques, en passant par le grand public. La Fondation développe une prise de conscience des enjeux environnementaux, du droit à un environnement sain et au développement durable, tel qu’il est consacré par la constitution du Royaume du Maroc. Par l’éducation et la sensibilisation, la Fondation prépare les générations futures à prendre en mains la préservation de leur cadre de vie, et à s’engager définitivement dans la voie du développement durable. Dans le déploiement de son programme d’action, la Fondation se réfère aux engagements pris par le Maroc lors des sommets de Rio en 1992 et 2012,et de Johannesburg en 2002, et que le royaume a décliné dans sa charte de l’Environnement et du Développement Durable, la loi-cadre et les stratégies nationales qui en ont découlées.

Son Altesse Royale la Princesse Lalla Hasnaa, présidente de cette Fondation dont les divers programmes visent à sensibiliser et à éduquer tous les publics au développement durable, en particulier les plus jeunes, a été l’invitée d’honneur de la première Conférence mondiale de l’UNESCO sur l’Éducation au Développement Durable (EDD) en novembre 2014 à Nagoya, au Japon. “L’éducation au développement durable est à la fois une tâche exaltante et un combat de longue haleine, car elle vise les mentalités et cherche à modifier les réflexes et les comportements à l’échelle de nos sociétés”, avait souligné SAR la Princesse Lalla Hasnaa lors de cette conférence, organisée conjointement avec le gouvernement japonais pour marquer la fin de la Décennie des Nations Unies pour l’éducation au service du développement durable (2005-2014). Le partenariat avec l’UNESCO est l’aboutissement d’un long cheminement, inauguré par l’adhésion de la Fondation Mohammed VI pour la protection de l’environnement à la 1ère Décennie de l’EDD (2005-2014). En octobre 2010, la Fondation et l’agence onusienne avaient co-organisé, sous le Haut Patronage de SM le Roi Mohammed VI, une importante Conférence internationale sur la gestion durable du littoral de Tanger. En 2013, la coopération s’est davantage consolidée lors du World Environmental Education Congress (WEEC), tenu à Marrakech et qui avait recommandé la mise en place “des réseaux d’acteurs de l’éducation environnementale afin de faciliter le partage des savoirs, des savoir-faire, des expériences et des bonnes pratiques”. L’adhésion de la Fondation Mohammed VI pour la protection de l’environnement à la 1ère décennie de l’EDD s’est concrétisée par le lancement de programmes complètement dédiés à l’éducation et dont les éducateurs sont le fer de lance. Il s’agit de “Eco-Écoles”, qui cible les écoles préscolaires et primaires, de “Jeunes Reporters pour l’Environnement” (JRE), destiné aux collèges et lycées, de la formation des jeunes journalistes à travers une plate-forme d’enseignement à distance e-learning et le développement d’outils pédagogiques en ligne. C’est dans cette lignée que la Fondation et l’UNESCO ont signé, en 2016, une convention-cadre à caractère général pour la période 2016-2021, qui permet à la Fondation de bénéficier du savoir-faire de l’organisation onusienne, de sa documentation et de sa pédagogie, pour renforcer les capacités de ses éducateurs et de ses formateurs pour le développement durable. Les deux parties ont, d’ailleurs, fait de cet axe de coopération un des cinq domaines du programme d'”Action Globale pour l’Éducation au développement durable” (GAP). La convention de 2016 a permis de profiter de l’expertise et des moyens pédagogiques et humains dont dispose l’UNESCO dans le domaine de la formation des éducateurs. Elle a aussi permis à la Fondation Mohammed VI pour la Protection de l’Environnement de bénéficier des cursus pédagogiques spécialisés, développés par cet organisme international en matière d’éducation au développement durable, ainsi que de son réseau d’experts internationaux. Par ailleurs, la Fondation développe annuellement un programme de formation en collaboration avec le ministère de l’Éducation nationale pour renforcer l’aptitude des éducateurs, répondant ainsi à la cible 4.7 de l’Objectif de Développement Durable 4 sur une éducation de qualité de l’Agenda Éducation 2030. Le réseau de la Fondation compte plus de 8.000 éducateurs JRE et plus de 30.000 éducateurs Eco-écoles. La Fondation oeuvre, en outre, au renforcement annuel des capacités de 94 formateurs (coordinateurs régionaux et provinciaux) pour soutenir la transformation vers un avenir durable. A cet effet, le Centre International Hassan II de Formation à l’environnement, inauguré en 2019 par SAR la Princesse Lalla Hasnaa, est dédié à la sensibilisation et à l’éducation à l’environnement de toutes les cibles visées par la Fondation: enfants, société civile, entreprises, administration et collectivités territoriales. “Si la terre alimente le corps, l’éducation ne nourrit-elle pas l’esprit ?”, avait, dans ce sens, souligné Son Altesse Royale à Vancouver, dans un discours devant les participants à la cérémonie d’ouverture du 9ème Congrès mondial de l’éducation à l’environnement (WEEC 2017).

La composition du Conseil comprend des opérateurs publics et privés. La FM6E est dotée d'un organigramme fonctionnel avec un président délégué, nommé par Sa Majesté le Roi Mohammed VI en Juin 2001. Si la préservation de l'Environnement est admise aujourd'hui comme moteur de croissance pour tous les pays dans le monde, elle l'est tout particulièrement pour Le Maroc, véritable coffre fort de richesses naturelles dont l'attractivité a fait du secteur touristique, un des piliers de l'Economie Nationale. Absolument consciente qu'un pan du Patrimoine écologique du pays est menacé et que tous ont la nécessité de faire face à un défi sans précédent sous peine d'obérer le développement futur, la Fondation Mohammed VI pour la Protection de l'Environnement sous la présidence effective de Son Altesse Royale La Princesse Lalla Hasnaa, a initié une démarche de prise de conscience et de responsabilisation partagée, impliquant tous les acteurs potentiels du Changement sous la bannière: TOUS POUR L'ENVIRONNEMENT. Cette démarche a comme substrat trois piliers : Le partage de l'engagement Une stratégie pour le développement durable L'Education des plus jeunes Elle vise à: Impliquer les acteurs (ONG, sponsors, collectivités, administrations publiques) Créer un mouvement de mobilisation de toutes les strates de la Société Pérenniser toute action initiée, sur le long terme La FM6E a inscrit ses actions dans le cadre de partenariats conventionnels avec l'ensemble des intervenants publics et privés. Dés l'année 2000, lors d'un colloque, Villes, Campagnes, Forêts et Plages, Son Altesse Royale, la Princesse Lalla Hasnaa avait souligné: «La sauvegarde de l'Environnement est aussi une affaire de comportement. L'Education a donc un rôle décisif à jouer pour aider à éveiller les consciences.» Toutes les actions éducatives de la FM6E vont tendre à sensibiliser les plus jeunes d'entre nous à l'importance de l'écologie pour en faire les Citoyens du 21ème Siècle, des Patriotes de l'Environnement. Ils devront grandir avec le crédo que les Biens Environnementaux constituent une ressource rare au prix très élevé. Ce prix est celui de notre bien être, de notre santé et de notre développement économique futur. Une approche méthodologique précise Pour penser le futur, en préalable à toute forme d'action, cette approche est concrétisée par des recherches, colloques, partenariats, conventions internationales, transferts de compétences et d'expériences, enquêtes. Elle aboutit à l'élaboration de nombreux programmes, avec indicateurs de résultats. Une approche écologique du développement. Dans la nécessité de propager la seule vision d'avenir possible pour le Développement Humain, celle d'une approche écologique du développement, la FM6E travaille à l'élaboration de nouveaux paramètres de Comptabilité économique et sociale. Ces instruments économiques pour équilibrer impératifs de croissance et protection de l'environnement, valoriseront les biens publics environnementaux. Cette vision nouvelle inclura pour l'avenir, une analyse de la contribution des éco systèmes locaux à l'activité économique et au bien être des populations tant par leurs ressources directes que par leurs qualités paysagères et touristiques. Des actions de fond engagées et soutenues sur le long terme. Protéger et préserver les ressources naturelles, le patrimoine côtier et forestier. Accompagner la Recherche pour favoriser le développement des ressources alternatives, eau, énergie, innovation de produits propres, de process et d'industries propres. Dans cet esprit, la FM6E associe les acteurs locaux pour l'identification, la programmation et la réalisation des projets environnementaux ayant un impact direct sur la vie de la population..

Imprimir CompartirFacebookTwitterWhatsappEmail GuardarLa ministra del Ambiente, Lucía Ruíz, destacó el trabajo que está realizando el Fondo de Promoción de las Áreas Naturales Protegidas del Perú (Profonanpe) a fin de canalizar fondos para la gestión efectiva de las áreas naturales y la conservación de la biodiversidad en el país. “En los últimos 27 años, nuestro sistema ambiental ha pasado por grandes e importantes cambios, los cuales han encontrado en Profonanpe siempre un aliado capaz de atender los desafíos”, comentó durante el evento organizado por dicha institución con la finalidad de presentar las acciones desarrolladas en el país. En el mencionado tiempo, Profonanpe se constituyó como el principal laboratorio de innovación financiera para la conservación de la biodiversidad, siendo el mejor aliado para la implementación de políticas en favor del fortalecimiento del Sistema Nacional de Áreas Protegidas por el Estado (Sinanpe). Desde su creación, sus acciones han captado más de US$ 200 millones para proyectos en el país. Actualmente implementa 18 proyectos de conservación en todo el Perú. “Necesitamos saber qué pasa en los proyectos que se ejecutan, con claridad y oportunidad de la información”, refirió durante la cita que reunió a representantes del sector público, privado, organizaciones de la sociedad civil y organismos internacionales. En ese sentido, dijo que es necesario renovar la confianza basada en la transparencia y rendición de cuentas, como elementos centrales de un trabajo conjunto entre el sector público y privado. En el evento se presentaron los hitos logrados por la entidad, los cuales son un reflejo del fortalecimiento de las áreas naturales protegidas y de la conservación de la biodiversidad, y destacan su rol de aliado estratégico para la implementación de las políticas públicas de conservación. Una de estos es la iniciativa “Patrimonio Natural del Perú”, que promueve la gestión efectiva y la sostenibilidad financiera a perpetuidad de las áreas naturales, y en la cual Profonanpe actúa como administrador, que permite su implementación. En la cita también participaron el jefe del Servicio Nacional de Áreas Naturales Protegidas por el Estado (Sernanp), Pedro Gamboa, y el director ejecutivo de Profonanpe, Anton Willems. Profonanpe es una entidad privada sin fines de lucro, especializada en la captación y administración de recursos financieros de manera eficiente, destinados a la ejecución de programas y proyectos que contribuyan a la conservación de la biodiversidad, la mitigación y adaptación del cambio climático. La presidencia está a cargo del Ministerio del Ambiente (MINAM).

Below are select notes that CharityWatch believes may be of interest to donors. CharityWatch's rating of Food and Water Watch is for the 501(c)(3) public charity (tax ID#32-0160439). The rating does not include the financial activities of the related 501(c)(4) tax-exempt, social welfare organization, Food and Water Action Fund (tax ID#32-0160436). CharityWatch will issue separate ratings for 501(c)(3) & 501(c)(4) organizations, even when their financial activities are included in consolidated audited financial statements, due to their differing tax treatment by the IRS. For more information on this topic, please see our sections on Types of Non-Profits and Tax Status, which can be found on the Our Process page. CharityWatch currently does not issue a separate rating of the 501(c)(4) Food and Water Action Fund, which has been relatively small in size. For more information about things to consider when donating to organizations that have related public charity and social welfare entities, read ""Sorting Out Non-Profit Pairs"" in the Articles & Alerts section, below. According to the Food and Water Watch audit of December 31, 2017 (Note 7, Related Party Transactions): ""The Organization shares common management and employees with Food and Water Action Fund (the Fund), a 501(c)(4) organization whose purpose is to lobby elected officials on behalf of citizens on issues of safe food and clean water.

211,"Francisco G. Cigarroa - Wikipedia Francisco G. Cigarroa From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Francisco CigarroaBorn (1957-12-07) December 7, 1957 (age 63)Laredo, Texas, U.S.EducationYale University (BS)University of Texas, Southwestern (MD)OccupationChairman of Ford Foundation[1] Francisco Gonzalez Cigarroa (born December 7, 1957) is an American transplant surgeon who served as chancellor of the University of Texas System. As a Mexican-American, Cigarroa is also the first Hispanic to serve as president of the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UTHSCSA).[2] Cigarroa currently serves as chairman of the Ford Foundation. He also serves as the head of pediatric transplant surgery at UTHSCSA. Born in the border city of Laredo in south Texas, Cigarroa graduated from J. W. Nixon High School. In 1979, he earned a bachelor's degree from Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. He received his medical degree from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas in 1983. He was elected to Alpha Omega Alpha, a national honor society for medical students, residents, scientists, and physicians in the United States and Canada. During his twelve years of postgraduate training, Cigarroa was chief resident at Massachusetts General Hospital – the teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts – and completed pediatric surgery and transplant surgery fellowships at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland.[3] In January 2009, Cigarroa was appointed chancellor of the University of Texas System. He is the first Hispanic to ever lead a major university system in the United States. Before this appointment he had been the first Hispanic president of the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. On July 1, 2010, Cigarroa began serving an elected six-year term as an Alumni Fellow to the Yale Corporation, the governing body of Yale University. In August 2011, Cigarroa presented to the University Board of Regents his Framework for Advancing Excellence designed to make the University of Texas System one of the top-ranked US educational systems of higher learning. The framework was unanimously approved by the Board of Regents and has since received national acclaim. In December 2011, Cigarroa was invited to the White House to share his program with US President Barack Obama and US Secretary of Education Arne Duncan. On February 10, 2014, Cigarroa announced his resignation from the UT System.[4] He said that he had accomplished the goals that he put forth in 2009 and that his departure was unrelated to recent political dissent surrounding the system regents. His office forwarded third party letters of recommendations to the president's office at UT Austin, but he was not involved in overturning decisions made by the admissions committee.[5] He played a leadership role in uncovering admission wrongdoings at UT Austin by commissioning the Kroll Report.[6] He currently works as Director of Transplantation Services at the University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio.

Year:1976 Muhammad Yunus pioneers the idea of microfinance Muhammad Yunus came to Ford with a vision to provide Bangladesh’s low-income communities with small loans to gain financial power and security. This work developed into the Grameen Bank—which today has more than 8 million borrowers across Asia, of which 97 percent are women—and earned Yunus a Nobel Prize and Presidential Medal of Freedom.

CigarroaPresidentDarren WalkerEndowmentUS$12.4 billion[2]Websitefordfoundation.org The Ford Foundation is an American private foundation with the mission of advancing human welfare.[3][4][5][6] Created in 1936[7] by Edsel Ford and his father Henry Ford, it was originally funded by a US$25,000 gift from Edsel Ford.[4] By 1947, after the death of the two founders, the foundation owned 90% of the non-voting shares of the Ford Motor Company. (The Ford family retained the voting shares.[8]) Between 1955 and 1974, the foundation sold its Ford Motor Company holdings and now plays no role in the automobile company. Ahead of the foundation selling its Ford Motor Company holdings, in 1949, Henry Ford II created the Ford Motor Company Fund, a separate corporate foundation that to this day serves as the philanthropic arm of the Ford Motor Company and is not associated with the foundation. The Ford Foundation makes grants through its headquarters and ten international field offices.[9] For many years, the foundation's financial endowment was the largest private endowment in the world; it remains among the wealthiest. For fiscal year 2014, it reported assets of US$12.4 billion and approved US$507.9 million in grants.[2][10] According to the OECD, the Ford Foundation provided US$194 million for development in 2019, all of which related to its grant-making activities.[11] Contents 1 Mission 2 History 2.1 Archives 3 Major grants and initiatives 3.1 Media and public broadcasting 3.2 Arts and free speech 3.3 Law school clinics and civil rights litigation 3.4 New York City public school decentralization 3.5 Microcredit 3.6 In vitro fertilisation 3.7 AIDS epidemic 3.8 International leadership 3.9 Israel 3.10 COVID-19 response 3.11 Disability Future Fellows 4 Criticisms and reforms 4.1 Mission-related investments 4.2 Native Arts and Culture Foundation endowment repatriation 4.3 Relationship with the United States Government 4.4 2005 Michigan Attorney General investigation 4.5 Gender roles and feminist theory 4.6 Criteria for Palestinian grantmaking 5 Ford Foundation Building 6 Presidents 7 See also 8 References 9 Further reading 10 External links Mission[edit] Ford Foundation Building in New York CityExterior of the buildingAtrium with garden After its establishment in 1936, Ford Foundation shifted its focus from Michigan philanthropic support to five areas of action. In the 1950 Report of the Study of the Ford Foundation on Policy and Program, the trustees set forth five ""areas of action,"" according to Richard Magat (2012): economic improvements, education, freedom and democracy, human behavior, and world peace.[12] These areas of action were identified in a 1949 report by Horace Rowan Gaither.[13][14] Since the middle of the 20th century, many of the Ford Foundation's programs have focused on increased under-represented or ""minority"" group representation in education, science and policy-making. For over eight decades their mission decisively advocates and supports the reduction of poverty and injustice among other values including the maintenance of democratic values, promoting engagement with other nations, and sustaining human progress and achievement at home and abroad.[12] The Ford Foundation is one of the primary foundations offering grants that support and maintain diversity in higher education with fellowships for pre-doctoral, dissertation, and post-doctoral scholarship to increase diverse representation among Native Americans, African Americans, Latin Americans, and other under-represented Asian and Latino sub-groups throughout the U.S. academic labor market.[15][16] The outcomes of scholarship by its grantees from the late 20th century through the 21st century have contributed to substantial data and scholarship including national surveys such as the Nelson Diversity Surveys in STEM.[17][18][19][20] History[edit] The foundation was established January 15, 1936,[4] in Michigan by Edsel Ford (president of the Ford Motor Company) and two other executives ""to receive and administer funds for scientific, educational and charitable purposes, all for the public welfare.""[21] During its early years, the foundation operated in Michigan under the leadership of Ford family members and their associates and supported the Henry Ford Hospital and the Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village, among other organizations. After the deaths of Edsel Ford in 1943 and Henry Ford in 1947, the presidency of the foundation fell to Edsel's eldest son, Henry Ford II. It quickly became clear that the foundation would become the largest philanthropic organization in the world. The board of trustees then commissioned the Gaither Study Committee to chart the foundation's future. The committee, headed by California attorney H. Rowan Gaither, recommended that the foundation become an international philanthropic organization dedicated to the advancement of human welfare and ""urged the foundation to focus on solving humankind's most pressing problems, whatever they might be, rather than work in any particular field...."" The report was endorsed by the foundation's board of trustees, and they subsequently voted to move the foundation to New York City in 1953.[4][22][23] The Ford Foundation's first international field office opened in 1952 in New Delhi, India. The board of directors decided to diversify the foundation's portfolio and gradually divested itself of its substantial Ford Motor Company stock between 1955 and 1974.[4] This divestiture allowed Ford Motor to become a public company. Finally, Henry Ford II resigned from his trustee's role in a surprise move in December 1976. In his resignation letter, he cited his dissatisfaction with the foundation holding on to their old programs, large staff and what he saw as anti-capitalist undertones in the foundation's work.[24][25] In February 2019, Henry Ford III was elected to the Foundation's Board of Trustees, becoming the first Ford family member to serve on the board since his grandfather resigned in 1976.[26][27] For many years, the foundation topped annual lists compiled by the Foundation Center of US foundations with the most assets and the highest annual giving. The foundation has fallen a few places in those lists in recent years, especially with the establishment of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2000. As of May 4, 2013, the foundation was second in terms of assets[2] and tenth in terms of annual grant giving.[28] Archives[edit] In 2012, stating that it is not a research library, the foundation transferred its archives from New York City to the Rockefeller Archive Center in Sleepy Hollow, New York.[29] Major grants and initiatives[edit] Based on recommendations made by the Gaither Study Committee and embraced by the foundation's board of trustees in 1949, the foundation expanded its grant making to include support for higher education, the arts, economic development, civil rights, and the environment, among other areas. Media and public broadcasting[edit] In 1951, the foundation made its first grant to support the development of the public broadcasting system, then known as National Educational Television (NET), which went on the air in 1952.[30] These grants continued, and in 1969 the foundation gave US$1 million to the Children's Television Workshop to help create and launch Sesame Street.[31] The Corporation for Public Broadcasting replaced NET with the Public Broadcasting Service on October 5, 1970.[32] Arts and free speech[edit] The foundation underwrote the Fund for the Republic in the 1950s. Throughout the 1950s, the foundation provided arts and humanities fellowships that supported the work of figures like Josef Albers, James Baldwin, Saul Bellow, Herbert Blau, E. E. Cummings, Anthony Hecht, Flannery O'Connor, Jacob Lawrence, Maurice Valency, Robert Lowell, and Margaret Mead. In 1961, Kofi Annan received an educational grant from the foundation to finish his studies at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota.[33] Under its ""Program for Playwrights"", the foundation helped to support writers in professional regional theaters such as San Francisco's Actor's Workshop and offered similar help to Houston's Alley Theatre and Washington's Arena Stage.[34] Law school clinics and civil rights litigation[edit] In 1968, the foundation began disbursing $12 million to persuade law schools to make ""law school clinics"" part of their curriculum. Clinics were intended to give practical experience in law practice while providing pro bono representation to the poor. Conservative critic Heather Mac Donald contends that the financial involvement of the foundation instead changed the clinics' focus from giving students practical experience to engaging in leftwing advocacy.[35] Beginning in the late 1960s and continuing through the 1970s, the foundation expanded into civil rights litigation, granting $18 million to civil rights litigation groups.[36] The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund was incorporated in 1967 with a US$2.2 million grant from the foundation.[36] In the same year, the foundation funded the establishment of the Southwest Council of La Raza, the predecessor of the National Council of La Raza.[37] In 1972, the foundation provided a three-year US$1.2 million grant to the Native American Rights Fund.[36] The same year, the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund opened with funding from numerous organizations, including the foundation.[36][38] In 1974, the foundation contributed funds to the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project[39] and the Latino Institute.[citation needed] New York City public school decentralization[edit] In 1967 and 1968, the foundation provided financial support for decentralization and community control of public schools in New York City. Decentralization in Ocean Hill–Brownsville led to the firing of some white teachers and administrators, which provoked a citywide teachers' strike led by the United Federation of Teachers.[40] Microcredit[edit] In 1976, the foundation helped launch the Grameen Bank, which offers small loans to the rural poor of Bangladesh. The Grameen Bank and its founder Muhammad Yunus were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for pioneering microcredit.[41] In vitro fertilisation[edit] Between 1969 and 1978, the foundation was the biggest funder for research into In vitro fertilisation in the United Kingdom, which led to the first baby, Louise Brown born from the technique. The Ford Foundation provided $1,170,194 towards the research.[42] AIDS epidemic[edit] In 1987, the foundation began making grants to fight the AIDS epidemic[43] and in 2010 made grant disbursements totalling US$29,512,312.[44] International leadership[edit] In 2001, the foundation launched the International Fellowships Program (IFP) with a 12-year, $280 million grant, the largest in its history. IFP is entering its concluding phase. The final cohort has been selected, and the program will conclude in 2013. Fellows represent historically disadvantaged groups from outside the United States. IFP has identified nearly 4,350 emerging leaders. More than 80 percent have completed their studies and are now serving their home communities.[45] Israel[edit] In April 2011, the foundation announced that it will cease its funding for programs in Israel as of 2013. It has provided US$40 million to nongovernmental organizations in Israel since 2003 exclusively through the New Israel Fund (NIF), in the areas of advancing civil and human rights, helping Arab citizens in Israel gain equality and promoting Israeli-Palestinian peace. The grants from the foundation are roughly a third of NIF's donor-advised giving, which totals about US$15 million a year.[46] COVID-19 response[edit] In June 2020, Ford Foundation decided to raise $1 billion through a combination of 30 and 50- year bonds. The main aim was to help nonprofits hit by the pandemic.[47] Disability Future Fellows[edit] In October 2020, Ford Foundation partnered with the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to establish the Disability Future Fellowship, awarding $50,000 annually to disabled writers, actors, and directors in the fields of creative arts performance.[48] [49] Criticisms and reforms[edit] Mission-related investments[edit] Ranked No. 24 on the Forbes 2018 World's Most Innovative Companies list, the Ford Foundation utilized its endowment to invest in innovative and sustainable change leadership shifting the model of grant-making in the 21st century. According to Forbes, ""Ford spends between $500 million and $550 million a year to support social justice work around the world. But last year, it also pledged to plow up to $1 billion of its overall $12.5 billion endowment over the next decade into impact investing via mission-related investments (MRIs) that generate both financial and social returns.""[50][51] Foundation President Darren Walker wrote in an op-ed in the New York Times that the grant-making philanthropy of institutions like the Ford Foundation ""must not only be generosity, but justice.""[52] The Ford Foundation seeks to address ""the underlying causes that perpetuate human suffering"" to grapple with and intervene in ""how and why"" inequality persists.[52] Native Arts and Culture Foundation endowment repatriation[edit] See also: Financial endowment § Ethics and endowment repatriation In 2007, the Ford Foundation co-founded the independent Native Arts and Culture Foundation by providing a portion of the new foundation's endowment out of the Ford Foundation's own. This decision to repatriate a portion of the Ford Foundation's endowment came after self-initiated research into the Ford Foundation's history of support of Native and Indigenous artists and communities. The results of this research indicated ""the inadequacy of philanthropic support for Native arts and artists"", and related feedback from an unnamed Native leader that ""once big foundations put the stuff in place for an Indian program, then it is not usually funded very well. It lasts as long as the program officer who had an interest and then goes away"" and recommended that an independent endowment be established and that ""[n]ative leadership is crucial"".[53] Relationship with the United States Government[edit] The foundation was accused of being funded by the US government.[54][55] John J. McCloy, the foundation's chairman from 1958–1965, knowingly employed numerous US intelligence agents and, based on the premise that a relationship with the CIA was inevitable, set up a three-person committee responsible for dealing with its requests.[56][57] Writer and activist Arundhati Roy connects the foundation, along with the Rockefeller Foundation, with supporting imperialist efforts by the U.S. government during the Cold War. Roy links the Ford Foundation's establishment of an economics course at the Indonesian University with aligning students with the 1965 coup that installed Suharto as president. [58] At the height of the Cold War, the Ford Foundation was involved in several sensitive covert operations. One of these involved the Fighting Group Against Inhumanity. Based in West Berlin, the Fighting Group undertook a range of missions in the East Zone, ranging from intelligence gathering to sabotage. It was funded and controlled by the CIA. In 1950, the U.S. government decided that the Fighting Group needed to bolster its legitimacy as a credible independent organization, so the International Rescue Committee was recruited to act as its advocate. One component of this project was convincing the Ford Foundation to issue a grant to the Fighting Group. With the support of Eleanor Roosevelt, the Ford Foundation was persuaded to give the Fighting Group a grant of $150,000. A press release announcing the grant pointed to the assistance given by the Fighting Group to “carefully screened” defectors to come to the West. The National Committee for a Free Europe, a CIA proprietary, actually administered the grant. (Chester, Covert Network, pp. 89-94.) 2005 Michigan Attorney General investigation[edit] In 2005, Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox began a probe of the foundation. Though the foundation is headquartered in New York City, it is chartered in Michigan, giving that state some jurisdiction. Cox focused on its governance, potential conflicts of interest among board members, and what he viewed as its poor record of giving to charities in Michigan. Between 1998 and 2002, the foundation gave Michigan charities about US$2.5 million per year, far less than many other charities its size. Gender roles and feminist theory[edit] American author, conservative philosopher, and critic of feminism Christina Hoff Sommers, criticized The Ford Foundation in her book The War Against Boys (2000) as well as other institutions in education and government.[59] Sommers alleged that the Ford Foundation funded feminist ideologies that marginalize boys and men. A Washington Post book review by E. Anthony Rotundo, author of ""American Manhood: Transformations in Masculinity from the Revolution to the Modern Era,"" counters that Sommers ""persistently misrepresents scholarly debate, [and] ignores evidence that contradicts her assertions"" about a gender war against boys and men.[60] Spanish judge Francisco Serrano Castro [es] made similar claims to Sommers in his 2012 book The Dictatorship of Gender.[61] These criticisms argue that the Ford Foundation is advancing a liberal agenda. Criteria for Palestinian grantmaking[edit] In 2003, the foundation was critiqued by US news service Jewish Telegraphic Agency, among others, for supporting Palestinian nongovernmental organizations that were accused of promoting antisemitism at the 2001 World Conference Against Racism. Under pressure by several members of Congress, chief among them Rep. Jerrold Nadler, the foundation apologized and then prohibited the promotion of ""violence, terrorism, bigotry or the destruction of any state"" among its grantees. This move itself sparked protest among university provosts and various non-profit groups on free speech issues.[62] The foundation's partnership with the New Israel Fund (NIF), which began in 2003, was criticized regarding its choice of mostly progressive grantees and causes. This criticism peaked after the 2001 World Conference Against Racism, where some nongovernmental organizations funded by the foundation backed resolutions equating Israeli policies with apartheid. In response, the Ford Foundation tightened its criteria for funding. In 2011, right wing Israeli politicians and organizations such as NGO Monitor and Im Tirtzu claimed the NIF and other recipients of Ford Foundation grants supported the delegitimization of Israel.[46] Ford Foundation Building[edit] Completed in 1968 by the firm of Roche-Dinkeloo, the Ford Foundation Center for Social Justice in New York City (originally the Ford Foundation Building) was the first large-scale architectural building in the country to devote a substantial portion of its space to horticultural pursuits. Its atrium was designed with the notion of having urban greenspace accessible to all and is an example of the application in architecture of environmental psychology. The building was recognized in 1968 by the Architectural Record as ""a new kind of urban space"". This design concept was used by others for many of the indoor shopping malls and skyscrapers built in subsequent decades. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the building a landmark in 1997.[63] Presidents[edit] Edsel Ford (founder): 1936–1943 Henry Ford II: 1943–1950 Paul G.

McCloy's answer to this problem was to create an administrative unit within the Ford Foundation specifically to deal with the CIA.

By the 1950s the Rockefeller and Ford Foundation, funding several NGOs and international educational institutions, began to work as quasi-extensions of the US government, which at the time was toppling democratically elected government in Latin America, Iran, and Indonesia. (That was also around the time it made its entry into India, then non-aligned but clearly tilting toward the Soviet Union.) The Ford Foundation established a US-style economics course at the Indonesian University. Elite Indonesian students, trained in counterinsurgency by US army officers, played a crucial part in the 1965 CIA-backed coup in Indonesia that brought General Suharto to power. He repaid his mentors by slaughtering hundreds of thousands of communist rebels. ^ Sommers, Christina Hoff (1994). Who Stole Feminism? How Women Have Betrayed Women. Simon & Schuster. pp. 53, 82.

Environmental Investigation Agency Opinion Greenwashed Timber: How Sustainable Forest Certification Has Failed The Forest Stewardship Council was established to create an international system for certifying sustainable wood. But critics say it has had minimal impact on tropical deforestation and at times has served only to provide a cover for trafficking in illegal timber. By Richard Conniff • February 20, 2018 Facebook Twitter Email When the Forest Stewardship Council got its start in 1993, it seemed to represent a triumph of market-based thinking over plodding command-and-control government regulation. Participants in the 1992 Rio Earth Summit had failed to reach agreement on government intervention to control rampant tropical deforestation. Instead, environmental organizations, social movements, and industry banded together to establish a voluntary system for improving logging practices and certifying sustainable timber. The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) soon set standards that seemed genuinely exciting to environmental and social activists, covering the conservation and restoration of forests, indigenous rights, and the economic and social well-being of workers, among other criteria. For industry, FSC certification promised not just a better way of doing business, but also higher prices for wood products carrying the FSC seal of environmental friendliness. A quarter-century later, frustrated supporters of FSC say it hasn’t worked out as planned, except maybe for the higher prices: FSC reports that tropical forest timber carrying its label brings 15 to 25 percent more at auction. But environmental critics and some academic researchers say FSC has had little or no effect on tropical deforestation. Moreover, a number of recent logging industry scandals suggest that the FSC label has at times served merely to “greenwash” or “launder” trafficking in illegal timber: In a 2014 report, Greenpeace, an FSC member, slammed the organization for standing by as FSC-certified loggers ravaged the Russian taiga, particularly the Dvinsky Forest, more than 700 miles north of Moscow. Greenpeace accused FSC-certified logging companies there of “wood-mining” forests the way they might strip-mine coal, as a nonrenewable resource, and of harvesting “areas that are either slated for legal protection or supposed to be protected as a part of FSC requirements.” A Chinese company marketing in the U.S. offered to put an FSC label on illegal wood in exchange for a 10 percent markup. In 2015, the U.S. flooring company Lumber Liquidators pleaded guilty to smuggling illegal timber from the last habitat of the Siberian tiger in the Russian Far East. Its main supplier of solid oak flooring was a Chinese company named Xingjia, which held an FSC “chain of custody” certification, meaning it was licensed to handle FSC-certified timber. According to an investigator in the case, another Chinese company marketing to the United States offered to put an FSC label on illegal wood flooring in exchange for a 10 percent markup.In Peru, investigators determined in 2016 that more than 90 percent of the timber on two recent shipments bound from the Amazon to Mexico and the U.S. was of illegal origin. In what it called an “unprecedented enforcement action,” the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative last October banned the main exporter in those shipments from the U.S. market. That company, Inversiones La Oroza, still boasts on its website that it “complies with the principles and criteria of Forest Stewardship Council (FSC),” though FSC finally suspended its certification in 2017. Logs certified by the Forest Stewardship Council get stamped with the organization’s logo. Gerhard Elsner/Wikimedia Commons In 2015, an undercover investigation implicated an FSC-certified Austrian company, Holzindustrie Schweighofer, in illegal logging in Romania, including some in national parks and other protected areas. An FSC expert panel subsequently recommended that the organization “disassociate” from Holzindustrie Schweighofer based on “clear and convincing evidence” of illegality. FSC opted at first for suspension instead. An outcry from environmentalists soon pushed it to break ties with the company, but FSC is already working on a “roadmap” to bring Schweighofer back into certification.The cases in China, Peru, and Romania all resulted from undercover operations by the Environmental Investigation Agency, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit. “We didn’t mean to go after FSC,” says David Gehl, that group’s Eurasia programs coordinator. FSC just kept turning up in the same places as a lot of illegal logging, he says. Many logging companies appeared to obtain an FSC certification for management practices on one forest, and then use it to cast a halo over their far more extensive dealings in forests elsewhere, with little regard for sustainability or even legality. ALSO ON YALE E360 Business as Usual: A resurgence of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. Read more. Kim Carstensen, director general of FSC International – which is based in Bonn, Germany – says the organization has acted appropriately in those cases. “I would claim that overall, our control systems are robust, solid, and continuously being developed,” he adds. “Nothing is perfect, and of course there are issues with FSC certificates. But we have very many stakeholders who point us to them and make us act on them. We have corrective actions happening constantly, and there is a lot of solidity, I think, in that system.” Simon Counsell, executive director of Rainforest Foundation UK and an early proponent of the forest certification idea, argues that the opposite is true. His frustration with FSC led him to co-found the website FSC-Watch.com, “where you can see many, many scores of examples right across the span of FSC’s life, and all types of forests and plantations, that suggest there are still some very serious systemic problems in the FSC. One of them is that the FSC secretariat is unable and arguably unwilling to control the certifying bodies that are responsible for issuing certifications in FSC’s name.” Sawmills along the Manantay River in Pucallpa, Peru, a major transport hub for timber illegally harvested from the Amazon. Environmental Investigation Agency These certifying agencies often display a lack of expertise on visits to logging operations, says Counsell, along with “the systematic downplaying of problems that are identified, and inadequate attention to fraud and misreporting of information.” That leniency may result partly from being paid directly by the companies they are supposed to audit. The certifiers also “know they can get away with issuing certificates even to companies that are flagrantly breaking the law, without any major repercussions from FSC,” he says. Carstensen counters that FSC takes action based on independent audits of its certifying companies, and that the payment setup is no different from a corporation paying an accounting firms to audit its finances. Money questions also handicap FSC in other ways, according to its critics. The organization’s decision-making structure consists of environmental, social, and economic (or industry) chambers, each having an equal vote. But many issues get farmed out to working groups, which can take years to reach a consensus. And the reality, says Counsell, is that environmental and social groups typically cannot match the resources and staff hours that logging companies with a financial interest at stake can devote to the process. (Carstensen counters that the environmental and social groups hold their own, in part by their ability to bring media attention to bad behavior.) ALSO ON YALE E360 Murder in Malaysia: How protecting native forests cost a Southeast Asian activist his life. Read more. When a motion ultimately comes to the floor at FSC’s general assemblies, held every three years, each chamber has a veto, meaning the power to block any initiative that goes against its interests. But at the 2017 general assembly, “the development of a voting block by the economic chamber to kill motions,” Grant Rosomon of Greenpeace wrote afterwards, became known as “the red sea” for the red “no” cards industry voters held up in unison. “This was extremely concerning,” said Rosomon, “particularly as high priority issues for the social and environment chambers were voted against without explanation, justification, or prior engagement in the cross-chamber motion preparation process.” He called it “a turning point” in how FSC operates. Industry has gained sway over the FSC because of competition from rival forest-certifying organizations run by industry. Industry has also gained sway over FSC because of competition from rival forest-certifying organizations, notably the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC). David Gehl of the Environmental Investigation Agency calls PEFC “basically certification by the industry, for the industry,” minus the social and environmental chambers. Buyers often have trouble distinguishing what Greenpeace calls “fake forest certification” from the real thing. The result is that it’s more difficult for FSC to impose rigorous standards on logging companies. But the danger is that lax standards could turn the FSC into a “fake forest certification” scheme, too. Money also skews the balance against effective certification in one other important way. Though FSC’s original purpose was to slow tropical deforestation, it has largely been absent from the tropics. Almost 85 percent of the 492 million acres of forest it has currently certified so far are in North America and Europe. “It’s as if someone outfitted an armada to sail off and fix forest management in the tropics,” says one FSC-watcher, “but instead it sailed off into the North.” Loggers certified by the Forest Stewardship Council have cut large portions of the Dvinsky Forest in Russia, including areas that were supposed to be protected. Greenpeace The change in direction wasn’t deliberate. Getting certified can be expensive, because of the need to set aside 10 percent of a forest for conservation, and the cost of improved labor and logging practices. Logging companies in developed countries are often better situated than their tropical counterparts to pay for those changes, or have already made those changes to comply with local laws. The result, says Counsell, is that FSC “is essentially rewarding forestry that’s already better because there is a better forest regulatory regime. It’s failing to transform those countries in the tropics, in the south, where there isn’t a good forest regime, indicating that as a voluntary measure it really isn’t adequate to change practices. And that of course is a big concern.” ALSO ON YALE E360 How tracking product sources may help save the world's forests. Read more. A 2016 meta-analysis of scientific studies found that FSC certification in the tropics has reduced degradation and improved labor and environmental conditions in the affected forest — no small accomplishment. But other rigorously designed studies looking at overall deforestation indicate that FSC has had little or no effect. That may be yet another money question, says Allen Blackman, an economist at Resources for the Future and lead author of a 2015 study on FSC certification in Mexico. Small-scale, poorly-performing logging operations are common in the tropics, and they aren’t the ones likely to get certified. FSC may also have had little effect on deforestation for the simple reason that “a lot of the deforestation in developing countries is not happening associated with forestry operations,” says Blackman. Instead, the driving factor is illegal land use change, meaning conversion of natural forests to palm oil plantations, commercial agriculture, and ranching. The apparent ineffectiveness of certification, Blackman and his co-authors conclude, should “give pause to policymakers” thinking of certification as a tool for addressing deforestation. Combined with the recent evidence of blatant illegality by FSC-certified companies, it might also give pause to consumers who have put their faith in the FSC label. It might give pause to the entire wood products industry, which has profited up to now by turning a blind eye to that illegality. Sooner or later, industry will have to face up to the painful reality that it needs a far more rigorous forest certification scheme, combined with governmental regulation — for instance, to stop those land conversions — if it wants there to be any forests left to profit from in the future.

Ensure equitable access to the benefits of FSC systems. Ensure integrity, credibility and transparency of the FSC system. Create business value for products from FSC certified forests. Strengthen the global network to deliver on goals 1 through 4. These goals are promoted managed and developed through six program areas:[5] forests, chain of custody, social policy, monitoring and evaluation, quality assurance and ecosystem services.[6] It claims that forests managed to its standards offer benefits to both local and wider communities and these are said to include cleaner air and water, and a contribution to mitigating the effects of climate change. Directly or indirectly, FSC addresses issues such as illegal logging, deforestation and global warming and some reports indicate positive effects on economic development, environmental conservation, poverty alleviation and social and political empowerment.[7][8] Using the FSC logo supposedly signifies that the product comes from responsible sources—environmentally appropriate, socially beneficial and economically viable. The FSC label is used on a wide range of timber and non-timber products, from paper and furniture to medicine and jewelry,[9] and aims to give consumers the option of supporting responsible forestry.[10] History[edit] According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, half of the world's forests have already been altered, degraded, destroyed or converted into other land uses.[11] Much of the remaining forests today suffer from illegal exploitation and otherwise poor management. FSC was established as a response to these concerns over global deforestation. Tropical deforestation as a global concern rose to prominence in the 1980s and can be somewhat attributed to a fight for action by environmentalists and northern countries over the need to protect tropical woodland.[12][13] Prior to this, a number of other economic and regulatory mechanisms such as financial aid, policy frameworks and trade conventions were established in the fight against deforestation. These include the International Tropical Timber Agreement (1983), the Convention of International Trade on Endangered Species (1975) and the Global Environment Facility (1991). Despite the increased level of concern on the run-up to the 1992 Earth Summit held in Rio de Janeiro, tensions between the North and the global South over access to finance and technology for the preservation of forests protracted negotiations.[14] Although many Northern countries had hoped for a legally binding convention the resulting Statement of Forest Principles represents the ""mean position of the lowest common denominator""[14] and is voluntary. Disappointed with the outcome of the Earth Summit, NGOs such as the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) began to turn their attention to industry for a more meaningful governance-orientated resolution to the problem of deforestation.[15] In the lead up to the Earth Summit, social groups, NGOs and industries were also beginning to consult on the issue of deforestation. In America the consultation process that eventually led to the establishment of the FSC was initiated in 1990 and concluded in the confirmation of support for the development of a voluntary worldwide certification and accreditation governance system that would cover all forest types.[16] In the UK, NGO WWF began to facilitate action through the establishment of the 1995 Group, recruiting organisations that had been spurred on by instances of direct action and boycotting over the sale of tropical wood to form an NGO-business partnership.[15] Through stakeholder involvement it became apparent that a standard-setting body would be required to verify the source of wood products and define sustainable forest management. After 18 months of consultation in ten different countries, the Forest Stewardship Council was established in 1993. This article may be unbalanced towards certain viewpoints.

(December 2017) The failure of governments to reach any notable form of consensus in the form of an internationally reaching and legally binding agreement caused both disillusionment and an opportunity for change through the involvement of civil society and business actors to form ""soft law"".[13] As such the establishment of the Forest Stewardship Council as the response to this disillusionment also represents a global shift from government to governance and its creation is a primary example of the use of market and economic factors to create movement on a global environmental issue.[17] The evolving historical context in which the FSC was formed is theorised to reflect a much broader skepticism towards state power and as a consequence a shift away from traditional state-centric forms of regulation. That said, although the FSC transcends national boundaries, the state continues to play a part in the regulatory landscape of the domestic forest and as such the FSC must develop appropriate domestic governance to reflect this.[13] Structure and governance[edit] FSC is an international membership organization with a governance structure based on participation, democracy, equity and transparency.[18] It is a platform for forest owners, timber industries, social groups and environmental organizations to come together to find solutions to improve forest management practices. It is an example of a product-oriented multistakeholder governance group. It is governed by its members, who join either as individuals or as representatives of organisations; they come from diverse backgrounds including environmental NGOs, the timber trade, community forest groups and forest certification organizations. Members apply to join one of three chambers – environmental, social and economic; each chamber is divided into northern and southern sub-chambers and votes are weighted to ensure that north and south each have 50%; this system is designed to ensure that influence is shared equally between different interest groups, without having to limit the number of members.[18] FSC has three levels of decision making bodies: The General Assembly,[19] the Board of Directors[20] and the Executive Director.[21] The General Assembly, which takes place every three years, is made up of the three membership chambers and is the highest decision-making body in FSC. The most recent General Assembly took place in 2014. Every member has the right to attend, formulate and submit motions, and vote. The General Assembly represents an opportunity for everybody to share, learn, establish new alliances and exchange and explore business opportunities to create a better future of the forests. The FSC Board of Directors is accountable to the FSC members. It is made up of nine elected individuals who are FSC members and advocates. One member of the Board of Directors is elected from each sub-chamber of the General Assembly. The Executive Director runs FSC on a day-to-day basis with the support of a multi-cultural professional team at the FSC International Center. He or she is accountable to the FSC Board of Directors. While the FSC International Center is based in Bonn, Germany, it has a decentralized network of FSC Network Partners[22] that promote responsible forest management on behalf of FSC. FSC Network Partners include FSC National Offices, FSC National Representatives and FSC National Focal Points.[22] Standards, certification and accreditation[edit] Standards development[edit] FSC is a global forest certification system established for forests and forest products; from the perspective of the WWF this voluntary mechanism can be regarded as one of the more interesting initiatives of the last decade to promote better forest management.[23] while a number of alternative national and regional forest certification bodies also exist around the globe It has 10 Principles and associated Criteria (FSC P&C) that form the basis for all FSC forest management standards and certification. FSC International sets the framework for developing and maintaining international, national and sub-national standards. This is intended to ensure that the process for developing FSC policies and standards is transparent, independent and participatory. In February 2012 the membership approved the first major revision to the FSC P&C, in order to bring its certification up to date.[24] The review and revision of the FSC P&C began in 2008 and gathered feedback from many FSC members and other stakeholders.[25] This revision also marked the start of a process of developing baseline requirements for each of the revised Criteria;[24] These requirements - called International Generic Indicators (IGIs) - are intended to ensure consistent application of the FSC P&C across all countries. Where national standards are not currently established, the IGIs will be used as interim standards. National Forest Stewardship Standard[edit] In addition to its global certification standard, FSC develops national standards in selected countries. These standards are closely aligned to the global certification standard and its criteria, but are adapted to local context conditions. Currently, so called National Forest Stewardship Standards exist for the following countries (sorted by first year of introduction): Brazilian Amazon (2001) Peru (2001) Colombia Natural Forests (2003) Denmark (2004, 2018) Netherlands (2004, 2018) Canadian Boreal Forests (2004) British Columbia (2005) Chile Plantations (2005) Spain (2006, 2020) Colombia Bamboo (2006) Luxembourg (2007, 2019) Canadian Maritime Region (2008) Sweden (2010) Papua New Guinea (2010, 2017) United States of America (2010) Finland (2010) Cameroon (2010, 2012) United Kingdom (2011, 2017) Central African Republic (2012) Republic of Congo (2012) Congo Basin Region (2012) Serbian Kosovo (2012) Ghana (2012) Russian Federation (2012) Germany (2012, 2017) New Zealand (2012) Democratic Republic of Congo (2012) Gabon (2012) Ireland (2012) Republic of Indonesia (2013) Poland (2013) Czech Republic (2013) Honduras (2014) Nicaragua (2014) Federal Republic of Brazil (2014) Bulgaria (2016) Metropolitan France (2016) People's Republic of China (2016) Portugal (2016) Italy (2017) Romania (2017) Kyrgyz Republic (2017) Rwanda (2017) Federal Republic of Germany (2017) Republic of Uganda (2017) South Africa (2017) Switzerland and Liechtenstein (2018) Brazilian Small and Low Intensity Managed Forests (2013) Tanzania Mainland (2018) Canada (2018) Australia (2018) Japan (2018) Nepal (2018) Malaysia (2018) Vietnam (2018) Bosnia and Herzegovina (2019) Ukraine (2019) Republic of Namibia (2019) Forest management certification[edit] Forest management certification is a voluntary process for verifying responsible forest practices. It is up to a forest owner, or representative of a group of forest owners and operators, to initiate the certification process by requesting an independent certifier to inspect the forest and to see if the management meets the FSC requirements, encapsulated in the FSC P&C. Only an FSC accredited certification body can evaluate, monitor and certify companies to FSC standards, and only continuous compliance can assure that certificate holders can keep their certificates; these holders are charged an annual fee to renew their accreditation. The FSC P&C apply to all tropical, temperate and boreal forests and many to plantations and partially replanted forests. Though mainly designed for forest management for timber products, they are also largely relevant for non-timber products (e.g. Brazil nuts) and other environmental services such as clean water and air and carbon sequestration. The FSC Principles are a complete package and their sequence does not represent an ordering of priority. Prior to the revision process which ended in February 2012, the FSC P&C were the following: No. Principle 1 Compliance with all applicable laws and international treaties. 2 Demonstrated and uncontested, clearly defined, long–term land tenure and use rights. 3 Recognition and respect of indigenous people’s rights. 4 Maintenance or enhancement of long-term social and economic well-being of forest workers and local communities and respect of worker’s rights in compliance with International Labour Organization (ILO) conventions. 5 Equitable use and sharing of benefits derived from the forest. 6 Reduction of environmental impact of logging activities and maintenance of the ecological functions and integrity of the forest. 7 Appropriate and continuously updated management plan. 8 Appropriate monitoring and assessment activities to assess the condition of the forest, management activities and their social and environmental impacts. 9 Maintenance of High Conservation Value Forests (HCVFs) defined as forests containing environmental and social values that are considered to be of outstanding significance or critical importance. 10 In addition to compliance with all of the above, plantations must contribute to reduce the pressures on and promote the restoration and conservation of natural forests. The Revised P&C were approved in February 2012 but will not be used for audit until the FSC IGIs are also complete. The full text of the revised P&C can be found on the FSC website[26] but the basic principles are listed below. The Organization shall comply with all applicable laws, regulations and nationally-ratified international treaties, conventions and agreements. The Organization shall maintain or enhance the social and economic wellbeing of workers. The Organization shall identify and uphold indigenous peoples’ legal and customary rights of ownership, use and management of land, territories and resources affected by management activities. The Organization shall contribute to maintaining or enhancing the social and economic wellbeing of local communities The Organization shall efficiently manage the range of multiple products and services of the Management Unit to maintain or enhance long term economic viability and the range of environmental and social benefits. The Organization shall maintain, conserve and/or restore ecosystem services and environmental values of the Management Unit, and shall avoid, repair or mitigate negative environmental impacts. The Organization shall have a management plan consistent with its policies and objectives and proportionate to scale, intensity and risks of its management activities. The management plan shall be implemented and kept up to date based on monitoring information in order to promote adaptive management. The associated planning and procedural documentation shall be sufficient to guide staff, inform affected stakeholders and interested stakeholders and to justify management decisions. The Organization shall demonstrate that, progress towards achieving the management objectives, the impacts of management activities and the condition of the Management Unit, are monitored and evaluated proportionate to the scale, intensity and risk of management activities, in order to implement adaptive management. The Organization shall maintain and/or enhance the High Conservation Values in the Management Unit through applying the precautionary approach. Management activities conducted by or for The Organization for the Management Unit shall be selected and implemented consistent with The Organization's economic, environmental and social policies and objectives and in compliance with the Principles and Criteria collectively. FSC accredited certification bodies certify and audit each individual forest management operation. If the forest management is in full compliance with FSC requirements, the FSC certificate is awarded. If the forest management is not fully compliant, pre-conditions are noted which must be fulfilled before the FSC certificate can be awarded. If minor non-compliances are noted, the certificate can be issued with conditions that have to be met within a clearly determined timeframe. Once certification is awarded, FSC accredited certification bodies audit each FSC certificate at least once a year. If during these audits the certification body finds that a company has non-compliances with FSC requirements, Corrective Action Requests (CARs) are issued and the company is required to make the prescribed changes within a given timeframe or lose its FSC certificate. Depending on the seriousness of the infringement, the timeline can go from one year for minor administrative infringements to immediate action for major infringements. Chain of Custody certification[edit] The FSC Chain of Custody (CoC) system allows the tracking of FSC certified material from the forest to the consumer.[27] It is a method by which companies can show their commitment to the environment and responsible forest management. Only companies that have FSC chain of custody certification are allowed to use the FSC trademarks and labels to promote their products. The FSC label therefore provides a link between responsible production and responsible consumption and helps the consumer to make socially and environmentally responsible buying decisions. Once a forest is certified it is important to be able to trace the products that come from it throughout the supply chain to ensure that any claims on the origin of the product are credible and verifiable. FSC chain of custody certification is a voluntary process. It is a tracking system that allows manufacturers and traders to demonstrate that timber comes from a forest that is responsibly managed in accordance with the FSC P&C. It tracks the flow of certified wood through the supply chain and across borders through each successive stage - including processing, transformation and manufacturing - all the way to the final product. It is up to a company to initiate the certification process by requesting the services of an independent certification body to inspect its internal tracking procedures. Only FSC-accredited certification bodies can evaluate, monitor and certify companies to FSC standards. Companies committing to FSC include home-improvement or DIY companies, publishers and retailers, amongst many others.[citation needed] All operations that want to produce an FSC certified product or want to make corresponding sales claims must comply with FSC's international standards for chain of custody. An operation must specify the range of products they wish to sell as FSC certified and promote with the FSC trademark. The certification body inspects the operation to ensure that controls are in place to identify eligible sources for the specified product range and to prevent certified and recycled material from mixing with material from unacceptable sources. If an operation complies with FSC standards, the company is issued an FSC chain of custody certificate. Major failure to comply with the standard will normally disqualify the candidate from certification or lead to de-certification.[citation needed] Controlled wood certification[edit] The FSC Mix label was introduced in 2004.[28] It allows manufacturers to mix FSC-certified material with uncertified materials in FSC-labeled products under controlled conditions. It aims to avoid the use of wood products from ""unacceptable"" sources in FSC-labeled products. Unacceptable sources include illegally harvested wood, wood harvested in violation of traditional and civil rights, wood harvested in HCV forests and wood harvested from areas where genetically modified trees are planted. Accreditation[edit] To maintain independence between the standards it sets and the operations seeking certification of both kinds, FSC does not conduct certification audits itself. FSC has developed rigorous procedures and standards to evaluate whether organizations of certifiers (certification bodies) can provide independent and competent evaluation (certification) services. This process is known as ‘accreditation’.[29] A potential certification body must gain FSC accreditation to be able to evaluate, monitor and certify companies to FSC standards. To become FSC accredited, certifiers have to comply with an extensive set of rules and procedures which are verified by ASI - Assurance Services International GmbH[30] - an international assurance partner for leading voluntary sustainability standards and initiatives such as MSC and RSPO. This includes an office audit and the witnessing of one or more audits in the field. ASI monitors accredited certification bodies to ensure the appropriateness of their operations can be continuously guaranteed. To control the continued implementation of FSC rules and procedures, every year ASI conducts at least one office and one field assessment for each FSC accredited certification body. The exact number and distribution of ASI assessments takes a number of complex factors into account (geographic areas, policies or products that carry increased risk) and the number of FSC certificates handled by an accredited certification body, and is meant to ensure that the certification services delivered by the certifier meet the requirements of the FSC. Some summaries of ASI surveillance audits are publicly available on the ASI website.[31] If an FSC accredited certification body is found to not fully comply with FSC rules and procedures, nonconformities (NCs) are raised (see above). Facts and figures[edit] In September 2012, some 165 million hectares were certified to FSC's Principles and Criteria in 80 countries.[32] Around 24,000 FSC Chain of Custody certificates were active in 107 countries.[32] The FSC website has statistics on regional distributions, ownership and forest type and numbers of FSC certificates[32] representing all valid forest management and chain of custody certificates. Costs[edit] The expenses for successful forest management certification typically are divided into: Costs for an enhancement of sustainability; Costs for audits (these are controlled by third parties); and Secondary costs (e.g. losses of stumpage revenues).[33] FSC Friday[edit] FSC Friday is a once-a-year-event dedicated to the celebration of forests around the globe, and the promotion of responsible forest management worldwide. The first international FSC Friday took place in Bonn on 25 September 2009.[34] On FSC Friday, people are invited to investigate what's in their shopping basket, and look for the FSC logo. Events related to FSC Friday take place around the world with companies and supporters promoting the FSC logo and what it stands for. FSC Friday in 2010 took place on 24 September and the following week. Events took place at FSC certified forests, schools, universities and community centers around the world, including the United Kingdom, Austria, South Africa, Germany, Brazil, Argentina, Belgium, Netherlands, Denmark, France, India, Wales, Switzerland and Singapore. Support and criticism of FSC certification[edit] Support[edit] FSC has around 850 members, including: several international NGOs such as the World Wide Fund for Nature,[35] and Oxfam/NOVIB; smaller, national NGOs, often with a conservation or environmental focus, such as the US Wildlife Conservation Society, the Spanish Ornithological Society and Cameroon Environmental Watch; civil society organizations with a community development focus, such as the Foundation for People and Community Development (Papua New Guinea) and the Mountain Association for Community Development (USA); forestry-focused research organizations, such as the Forestry Science and Research Institute (Brazil); certification organizations, such as KPMG Forest Certification Solutions (Canada), Forest Eco Certification (India),[36] Wood Certification Ltd (India); private companies in the forestry, timber and paper industries, such as Mondi (South Africa) Sun Wood Industries (Thailand) and IKEA (Sweden); trade unions and workers’ associations, such as the Latvian Wood Branch Trade Union and the Swedish Forest and Wood Trade Union. Numerous governments worldwide have strengthened market-based incentives for timber certification by providing tax benefits to certified companies, referencing certified products as requirements in their procurement policies[37][38][39][40][41] and supporting projects linked to FSC through their international development agencies. Some companies also choose timber certification as a tool to demonstrate their commitment to sustainability.[42] Such activities demonstrate broad support for FSC certification as good practice. FSC is a member of the International Social and Environmental Accreditation and Labelling (ISEAL) Alliance,[43] an association of voluntary international standard setting and certification organizations focused on social and environmental issues. Since 2006, FSC has complied with ISEAL's Code of Good Practice for Setting Social and Environmental standards,[44] aimed at assuring high standards for credible behavior in ethical trade. In 2009, FSC began a pilot project with Fairtrade International (FLO)[45] to help community-based and small-scale timber producers get a fair price for their products and gain visibility in the marketplace.[46] The first jointly labelled FSC-FLO products went onto the market in 2011.[47] FSC also works in liaison with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). It contributes to the ISO's committees on sustainable criteria for bioenergy, environmental auditing and environmental labelling.[48] Criticism[edit] Since it was founded, FSC has been criticized for a range of different reasons. In recent years, a number of well-known NGOs and environmental organizations have canceled their support for FSC. These include FERN (2011),[49] Friends of the Earth UK (2008),[50] ROBINWOOD (2009),[51] the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation (SSNC) (2011),[52] and smaller groups such as Rainforest Rescue[53] and the Association for the Ecological Defence of Galicia (ADEGA).[54] Other NGO members, instead of withdrawing support, have critically evaluated FSC's performance and made recommendations to improve the credibility of the organization. These include Greenpeace International, whose 2008 report ‘Holding the line with FSC’ focused on controversial certificates and ways forward.[55] A revised version of the report was released in 2011, which concluded that some progress had been made. But it also identified ongoing weaknesses, including lack of guidance on HCVFs and activities in controversial areas like the Congo Basin and problems with the Controlled Wood label, the Chain of Custody system and logo integrity. The report concluded with 10 immediate changes needed to ""restore FSC’s credibility"".[56] To improve its process for tracking FSC certified products and maintaining the veracity of FSC claims, FSC is currently developing an Online Claims Platform and is pursuing opportunities for fiber testing. Chamber-balanced Working Groups have been established to strengthen the Controlled Wood system and the Chain of Custody standard, and options are being pursued to address the performance of certification bodies. FSC has been harshly criticized by Simon Counsel, one of its founding members, now the director of the Rainforest Foundation. In 2008, he described the FSC as the ""Enron of Forestry"".[57] He cited case studies from six countries[citation needed] which suggested that in these cases FSC was not properly controlling accredited auditors or certifiers. The FSC reviewed the certificates in question, and showed that some of the initial investigations were justified. This resulted in the removal of the license to certify from the Thai company, Forest Industry Organisation. FSC-Watch is a website critical of FSC which is run by a group of people, including Simon Counsel, who are concerned about what they perceive as the constant and serious erosion of the FSC's reliability and credibility. Its website offers a wide range of extensive and detailed criticisms of FSC.[58] FSC-Watch commonly accuses FSC of practices that are a form of greenwashing.[52] In 2008, the EcoEarth/Rainforest Portal, an Internet ecological news aggregation service, publicly questioned the FSC-endorsed policy of old-growth forest logging.[59] They asserted that research does not support the idea that this type of logging is carbon positive or sustainable, though these views are disputed. Critics are encouraged to file complaints and disputes against FSC in case of any differences.[60] But complainants must meet a number of conditions to be able to file complaints[61] and it is disputed whether the FSC takes effective action even in the case of some formal complaints.[62] Recently, FSC has implemented a series of actions to strengthen its stakeholder engagement process, including the establishment of a Quality Assurance Unit within FSC, time-bound dispute resolution procedures and a web-based portal for tracking disputes. In 2018, Greenpeace International chose not to renew its membership with FSC, claiming that FSC is not meeting its goals of protecting forests and human rights.[63] The same year FSC investigated allegations made by local tribesmen in Papua against FSC certificate holder Korindo Group. The investigation found Korindo to have violated the rights of the Papuan indigenous peoples and benefited from close ties with the Indonesian military for its own economic benefit. While the report recommended stripping Korindo of it FSC certificate, FSC chose not to publicly release the report and continues its collaboration with Korindo. [64] Preference for bigger companies[edit] Some critics[who?] point out that FSC certification has a linked set of weaknesses: that it is not suited for small businesses, that it is anti-competitive and that therefore in a wider view it is counter-ecological: Only large businesses with rigid structures can afford the process of assessment and maintenance of the schemes. Certification schemes are anti-competitive because they favor larger firms over smaller ones. This bias towards large companies is counter-ecological as it promotes a model of a few massive suppliers.[citation needed] Fewer local companies mean that goods have to travel farther, and the resources and skills of local communities degrade.[citation needed] Partly in response to these criticisms, to make certification more accessible to small and medium-sized businesses, FSC instituted the Small and Low Intensity Managed Forests (SLIMF) initiative[65] and group certification. SLIMF adapts the FSC system to the realities and needs of small and low intensity forest operations by offering special streamlined procedures, with less rigorous requirements for a number of its forest management criteria. SLIMF are defined as forests of 100 hectares or less. Group certification allows a group of forest owners to share certification costs. A documented success of group certification in a developing country involved smallholder farmers growing acacia in Vietnam.[66] In that case, farmers were able to sell group certified wood at a premium versus comparable non-certified wood. In October 2012, worldwide, 8.7% of FSC certificates were held by community-owned forests.[32] SLIMF and group certification are intended to allow FSC to promote responsible forest management in small-scale forests as well as large ones. Resolute Forest Products[edit] The world's largest manager of FSC certified forests,[67] Resolute Forest Products, has been accused of illegal logging on Barriere Lake Algonquin territory and of violating indigenous rights. In July 2012, members of the Algonquin community in southern Quebec staged a camp to observe and deter the logging of their unceded territory. In an interview Michel Thusky, an elder of the Barriere Lake Algonquin, had this to say: ""The worst thing about it is they have gotten the Forest Stewardship Council Certification for their products. That is a total shame... They [Resolute Forest Products] cut last Tuesday and we interrupted them. We asked them to stop until we have a meaningful consultation. We extended our respect but they failed. On July 9th they sent a riot squad and many police officers, what they call Sûreté du Québec, security of Quebec. They put conditions on us. They put a blockade on us, in the Algonquin birth place. If we go past a certain line, they say they will arrest us.""[68] The firm has a different view of related events, stating that their ""right to harvest in the area [had] been approved by the QMNRW, following appropriate consultation with the Barrière Lake Algonquin band council.""[69] FSC as market-driven environmental governance[edit] Because it works outside of state regulations, some academics have classified FSC as an example of a non-state market driven (NSMD) form of environmental governance.[70] This means that it uses the market to drive the sustainable management of forests.[71] As Cashore (2002) observes the FSC network does not have the political authority of a traditional nation state and no one can be fined or imprisoned for failing to comply with its regulations. In addition, governments are forbidden from being members of the FSC and their only engagement with FSC is as land owners. The authority of the FSC is determined by the approval of external audiences, such as environmental NGOs.[56] The FSC Label is an example of the use of public purchasing power to create shifts in industry and regulate the negative environmental impacts of deforestation.[72] The FSC Label ""works"" by providing an incentive for responsible forestry in the market place. It offers manufacturers a competitive advantage and thereby increases market access to new markets and maintains access to existing ones. Non-state market-driven methods are often used because of allegations of ‘state failure’ in managing the environment. In the neoliberal view, market based methods are seen as one of the most effective and efficient ways to meet environmental goals. The market is seen as the key mechanism for producing the maximum social good and governance networks are seen as the most efficient way to regulate environmental concerns.[73] The FSC transnational NGO network demonstrates theories of global governance, more specifically in governance network theory. FSC is an example of how network governance can create change in industry and encourage organizations to improve the sustainability of industrial forestry practices. As Bäckstrand (2008) states, the FSC governance network brings together private companies, organizations and civil society in a non-hierarchical fashion, to voluntarily address certain goals.[74] According to governance network theory, actors in the network are dependent on each other and collaborate to reach specific goals, through exchanging information or resources.[75] Through the chamber system, governance of FSC has checks at local, national and international levels which mean that it includes interests regardless of their geographical location. This gives FSC some advantages over state governance systems.[76] In theory, as a governance network, FSC members share knowledge, environmental goals and knowledge of what those goals entail. This means that they coordinate effectively, improving the process and outcomes of the environmental policies they pursue. Moreover, knowledge sharing and collaboration enables the FSC network to deal with complex and interrelated issues.[77] Some critiques however suggest that network governance does not always work this way. Network governance theory suggests that partnerships should be equal, but inequalities of power within networks can result in hierarchical relationships determined by more dominant actors. Within FSC, larger international actors may have a stronger influence than smaller stakeholders, meaning that the FSC governance network may not represent all participants fairly. FSC has instituted the chamber system to try to tackle this imbalance. Furthermore, actors in networks operate as representatives of certain groups but also as individuals with their own agendas and values, and members in the FSC network are usually motivated by pragmatic rather than moral considerations.[78] Moreover, Sorenson and Torfing (2005) argue that for governance networks to achieve their goals they should be controlled by democratically elected politicians.[79] Although formerly there were no elections in the FSC governance system, reforms mean that the Board of Directors is now democratically elected by the membership chambers. Recognition in green building certification systems[edit] FSC certified construction wood and construction products made from FSC certified wood can contribute to green building certification systems. Some green building certification systems are recognizing a FSC certification in general, other award different scores to products with FSC 100, FSC MIX or FSC RECYCLED. LEED[edit] FSC certified wood products contribute to score up to 2 points in the LEED v4.1 credit 'Sourcing of Raw Materials'.[80] In addition, FSC certified wood products can contribute to score up to 1 point in the LEED v4.1 pilot credit 'Social Equity within the Supply Chain'.[81] BREEAM[edit] BREEAM awards credits for FSC certified wood products in the Mat 03 credit. The BREEAM Guidance Note GN18[82] attributes different scores to FSC 100% (7 points) and FSC MIX / FSC RECYCLED (5 points). DGNB[edit] DGNB recognizes FSC certified wood products in the ENV1.3 credit.[83] FSC Mix scores in the Quality Level 1.2 (up to 25 out of 100 points) and FSC 100 / FSC RECYCLED score in the Quality Level 1.3 (up to 70 out of 100 points. FSC RECYCLED also scores points in the Quality Level 2.2. Competing certification schemes[edit] There are a number of certification schemes for forest management apart from FSC certification.[84] The main competing forest certification system is the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC), established by a number of stakeholders, including associations of the forest industry, pulp-and-paper production and forest owners in response to the creation and increasing popularity of FSC.[85] PEFC has been criticized for having little influence from local people or environmental organizations, lack of transparency and non-objective requirements.[84] Other certification schemes include the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI),[86] the Malaysian Timber Certification Council,[87] the Australian Forestry Standard,[88] and Keurhout.[89] See also[edit] Certified wood Eco-labels Aquaculture Stewardship Council Marine Stewardship Council Sustainability standards and certification Independent forest monitoring Wood laundering References[edit] ^ Hale, Thomas (2020).

These principles cover a broad range of issues, from maintaining high conservation values to community relations and workers’ rights, as well as monitoring the environmental and social impacts of the forest management. FSC also provides a number of criteria relating to each principle to provide practical ways of working out whether they are being followed. Our principles have been developed to be applicable worldwide and relevant to all kinds of forest ecosystems, as well as a wide range of cultural, political and legal settings. The two relevant documents below are available to download in the document centre: FSC-STD-01-001 V5-2 FSC Principles and Criteria for Forest Stewardship are designed to serve as a common starting point for developing National Forest Stewardship Standards. FSC-STD-60-004-20 V2-0 International Generic Indicators. National & interim national standards FSC's Principles and Criteria set out the global requirements for responsible forest management. Chamber-balanced standard development groups (SDG) adapt the International Generic Indicators at the regional or national level to reflect the diverse legal, social and geographical conditions of forests in different parts of the world. The resulting adjustment is incorporated into a National Forest Stewardship Standard. The following relevant document is available in the document centre: FSC-STD-60-002 Structure and Content of National Forest Stewardship Standards. In countries lacking a National Forest Stewardship Standard, a technical working group can form and develop an interim national forest standard. More information about this process is available in the following document which can be accessed in the document centre: FSC-PRO-60-007 Structure, Content and Development of Interim National Standards. Group & SLIMF certification FSC certificate holders can also join together to form a group certification scheme and share their efforts for forest management planning, harvesting, monitoring and marketing their products. Group certification makes it easier, particularly for smallholders, to become FSC certified, as it enables group members to share costs and workload for applying and maintaining an FSC certificate. Small or low-intensity managed forests (SLIMF) are eligible for streamlined requirements and auditing procedures that reduce the costs and efforts of the certification. Many countries have developed specific forest management requirements for SLIMF in their national standards, to facilitate the certification process for smallholders. Check your national standard, or talk to your national or regional office to find out if this is the case in your country. Similarly, the auditing process can be relaxed for SLIMF operations. The following relevant document can be downloaded from the document centre: FSC-STD-01-003 V1-0 SLIMF Eligibility Criteria. FSC-STD-30-005 FSC Standard for Group Entities in Forest Management Groups FSC-STD-20-007 Forest Management Evaluations Controlled wood Controlled wood is material from acceptable sources that can be mixed with FSC-certified material in products that carry the FSC Mix label. The controlled wood requirements identify five categories of unacceptable sources for wood, which is not allowed to be mixed with FSC-certified material. These are: Illegally harvested wood Wood harvested in violation of traditional and human rights Wood harvested in forests in which high conservation values (HCVs) are threatened by management activities Wood harvested in forests being converted to plantations or non-forest use Wood from forests in which genetically-modified trees are planted The controlled wood standards Controlled wood meets the requirements of the two main FSC controlled wood standards. · FSC-STD-40-005 V3-1 FSC Requirements for Sourcing FSC Controlled Wood - This standard directs businesses to avoid sourcing material from unacceptable sources. You can find our written summary of the important dates and deadlines introduced by V3-1 of the standard here. FSC-STD-30-010 V2-0 FSC Controlled Wood Standard for Forest Management Enterprises - This standard specifies requirements for forest management enterprises to show that their management practices result in material from acceptable sources.

For two decades, Forest Trends has pioneered the idea that creating economic value in our forests and natural ecosystems is one of the most powerful incentives for sustaining them.Traditional markets and financial systems fail to fully value all of the ways we benefit from a healthy planet. Forests and other ecosystems clean our air, provide natural protection against floods, and enrich the soil. When we fail to value these benefits, we waste and degrade critical natural assets.Forest Trends’ mission is to work with communities, governments, and businesses to more fully embed conservation into economic activity and prevent the destruction that comes from badly planned, unsustainable resource allocation and development. Deforestation persists in part because people living in remote and pristine areas lack other income-generating options, which in turn results in massive emissions of carbon into the atmosphere.Forest Trends develops incentive systems that pay people to manage rather than destroy forests. Making the case to public and private sector investors in these incentive systems is a critical part of FT's work.Markets for carbon credits and water are advancing as a result of FT's work. Ambition for Change Our ambition is to demonstrate that preserving natural assets yields much greater long-term benefits than the economic activities that damage these natural assets for short-term profit. We seek to place sustainability at the heart of the economy, thereby creating new growth opportunities and rewarding good stewards such as indigenous communities. Path to Scale Forest Trends facilitates investments in nature by 1) Piloting next-generation business models, tools, and strategies for a 21st century green economy; 2) Building strong and diverse coalitions between unusual partners; and 3) Delivering transparent and credible data on environmental markets and finance. Skoll Awardee Michael JenkinsPresident & CEO, Forest Trends Association Michael Jenkins is the founding President of Forest Trends. For more than a decade he worked as a tropical forester in Haiti, Paraguay and Brazil, where he witnessed first-hand the effects of extreme degradation of natural ecosystems on poor people and that charitable approaches alone were insufficient to solve these problems. Then from 1989-1999 he led the MacArthur Foundation’s conservation and sustainable resource program through a reorientation strategy, taking a whole systems approach that outlined the forest value chain and identified strategies to build financial and community sustainability into the system. In 1998, he founded Forest Trends, focused on increasing the market value of natural ecosystems like tropical forests to prevent their conversion to agricultural use (oil palm soy, cattle, etc.) or other development, thereby mitigating the effects of climate change and benefiting local communities. Michael received the Skoll Award for Social Entrepreneurship in 2010.

Dividing a charity's average program expenses by its average total functional expenses yields this percentage. We calculate the charity's average expenses over its three most recent fiscal years.Source: IRS Form 990Administrative Expenses17.1%As reported by charities on their IRS Form 990, this measure reflects what percent of its total budget a charity spends on overhead, administrative staff and associated costs, and organizational meetings.

We calculate the charity's average expenses over its three most recent fiscal years.Source: IRS Form 990Liabilities to Assets Ratio44.4%The Liabilities to Assets Ratio is determined by Total Liabilities divided by Total Assets (most recent 990).Part of our goal in rating the financial performance of charities is to help donors assess the financial capacity and sustainability of a charity. As do organizations in other sectors, charities must be mindful of their management of total liabilites in relation to their total assets. This ratio is an indicator of an organization’s solvency and or long term sustainability. Dividing a charity's total liabilities by its total assets yields this percentage.

We include in a charity's working capital unrestricted and temporarily restricted net assets, and exclude permanently restricted net assets. Dividing these net available assets in the most recent year by a charity's average total expenses, yields the working capital ratio. We calculate the charity's average total expenses over its three most recent fiscal years.Source: IRS Form 990Program Expense Growth19.02%We compute the average annual growth of program expenses using the following formula: [(Yn/Y0)(1/n)]-1, where Y0 is a charity's program expenses in the first year of the interval analyzed, Yn is the charity's program expenses in the most recent year, and n is the interval of years passed between Y0 and Yn.Source: IRS Form 990GovernanceCharity Navigator looks to confirm on the Form 990 that the organization has these governance practices in place.Sources Include: IRS Form 990Governance:Independent Voting Board MembersNo Material Diversion of AssetsAudited Financials Prepared by Independent AccountantDoes Not Provide Loan(s) to or Receive Loan(s) From Related PartiesDocuments Board Meeting MinutesDistributes 990 to Board Before FilingCompensates BoardPoliciesCharity Navigator looks to confirm on the Form 990, or for some metrics on the charity's website, that the organization has these policies in place.

Our partnership with Feedback Labs and Guidestar by Candid, and other partners including Fund for Shared Insight, GlobalGiving, and Keystone Accountability, enables us to launch the first version of this beacon with Constituent Feedback information collected on Candid's site.Feedback practices have been shown to support better Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion outcomes, an essential area of assessment that we intend to further expand and develop in the future. Feedback Labs has documented several studies which indicate that beyond achieving organizational goals, nonprofits that are attentive and responsive to concerns and ideas raised by beneficiaries establish stronger relationships with the people they serve, promote greater equity, and empower constituents in ways that can help to ensure better long-term outcomes.

Department of Wood Engineering Forest resources of Japan which had planted after the world war II, had grown well. Now we are in a full-fledged use period. Among the domestic wood use in 2014, about 50 percent was used in construction, and 40 percent of which was domestic wood. The proportion of wooden houses in new housing is around 55%. But in larger buildings (e.g. public buildings), the proportion is very low, and which has become the challenge. In the global environmental issues, in order to maintain a high carbon absorption ability, it is important to maintain the vigorous state of forests. On the other hand, it is important to store the absorbed carbons longer term in building structures or infrastructures and prevent to re-emit to the atmosphere. The Japan has the history of wood utilization which has a close relationship with own culture. But we need a firm scientific meaning not in emotional. We conduct the researches to provide the safe, relief and enrichment for modern life. And we research to take advantage of more of the wood.

232,"Beautiful forests of the world | loveexploring.com Travel News Inspiration Destinations Travel Tips Travel Deals Sign In Travel News Inspiration Destinations Travel Tips Travel Deals Beautiful forests of the world Gallery View| Expand View Bewitching woods of the world Ruta Production/Shutterstock There's nothing like a walk through the trees to soothe the soul. The world is full of wonderful woodlands from light-dappled deciduous groves to thickets of towering evergreens and fern-filled tropical jungles. Read on to discover some forests that have a special kind of magic… Zhangjiajie National Forest Park, China Ana Flasker/Shutterstock As the inspiration for the movie Avatar, the subtropical forests, deep ravines and towering sandstone buttes of Zhangjiajie National Forest Park definitely resemble a lost world. This ethereal place is part of the vast UNESCO World Heritage site of Wulingyuan Scenic and Historic Interest Area in central China’s Hunan Province, and is home to rare species such as the ginko tree as well unusual primates and birds. The park offers some thrilling ways to explore the landscape, including glass walkways and cable cars that offer a bird's-eye view of the lush forest below. Oulanka National Park, Finland Jarmo Piironen/Shutterstock With nearly 75% of it covered in boreal forest, Finland is a top spot for tree-lovers. One of the most stunning Finnish forest-and-lake-studded wildernesses is Oulanka National Park, just near the Arctic circle and on the border with Russia. Autumn is a lovely time here when the Scotch pines, spruces and silver birches are painted with mellow colours and an assortment of fungi spring up on the forest floor. Although when snow falls, the scenery is pure magic too. Reindeer live in this remote place, as do wolves, lynx, bears, wolverines, pine martens and elk. Black Forest, Germany Arthur Palmer/Shutterstock The vast Schwarzwald (Black Forest) drapes across the mountainous Baden-Württemberg region in southwest Germany. With its pretty lakes, shady valleys, mountain villages and, of course, thick evergreen forests filled with gorgeously green fir and pine trees, it is a gorgeous scene. Although with such dense foliage, the area can be a little dark and spooky at times, which explains why the Brothers Grimm set so many of their fairy tales in this bewitching forest. Tongass National Forest, Alaska, USA YegoroV/Shutterstock Big is definitely beautiful when it comes to this wide-ranging and diverse forest in Alaska. At 16.7 million acres, Tongass National Forest is the biggest national park in the US. It's also where you'll find the world’s largest temperate rainforest, as well as countless tiny islands, glaciers and icefields. All manner of woodland creatures live among its trees, which include huge and ancient sitka spruce, western hemlock and cedar trees, such as black and brown bears, mountain goats, black-tailed deer, wolverines, river otters, harbor seals and bald eagles. Cathedral Grove, Canada Delpixel/Shutterstock There’s nothing like nature to make you feel insignificant. Standing under the old giants in Vancouver Island’s Cathedral Grove, part of MacMillan Provincial Park, certainly put things in perspective. In this last vestige of the giant douglas fir trees that once commanded the isle, there are trees more than 800 years-old. The south side of this coastal forest has the largest specimens, with one measuring more than 29.5 feet (9m) in circumference. The northern side has groves of ancient Western red cedar trees. Trails loop around this old-growth forest, where deer, elk, black bear and cougar are known to prowl. Wistman’s Wood, England Andy333/Shutterstock There’s something decidedly mystical about this tangled forest of gnarled dwarf oak trees and moss-covered boulders near the River Dart in Dartmoor National Park. Part of an ancient forest that covered the moorland in 7,000 BC, before the Mesolithic era, the high-altitude oaks are believed to be 500 years-old. It was thought to have been used as a sacred grove by Druids. The strange forest is also home to a healthy population of one of Britain’s few native snakes, the adder. Take a look at more of the world's mysterious places. Jasmund National Park, Germany Sybille Reuter/Shutterstock With its soaring beech trunks and leafy canopy, Jasmund National Park on the German isle of Rügen has the largest contiguous beech forest on the Baltic Sea coast, covering some 2,100 hectares. It was the latest forest to be added to the UNESCO World Heritage Site known as the Ancient and Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and Other Regions of Europe. Extending across 12 countries, the site protects the European beech, which survived the last ice age in small refuges in the south and southeast of Europe, and went on to colonise large parts of the continent. Hallerbos, Belgium Stefano Termanini/Shutterstock The ancient Belgian forest of Hallerbos, or the Blue Forest, is beautiful all year-round but it really springs to life in April when countless bluebells burst through the earth and bloom on its dappled forest floor. As the seasonal display sweeps across the forest like a gorgeous natural purple carpet, the park usually becomes even more popular with walkers. A Bluebell Trail goes right through the heart of the forest, which is just 12.5 miles (20km) south of Brussels, so the delicate flowers don't get trampled. As well as elegant beech trees, the magical woodland also has giant sequoia trees. Congo Basin, various Sergey Uryadnikov/Shutterstock Occupying a staggering 500 million acres, the Congo Basin is the world’s second-largest tropical rainforest. It’s so sizeable that it spans six countries in central-west Africa, including Cameroon and Gabon. The Congo's biodiverse swamps, savannahs and forests are home to precious species such as forest elephants, chimpanzees, bonobos, lowland and mountain gorillas, and chimpanzees. Take a look at the world's most endangered rainforests. Arashiyama Bamboo Grove, Japan odd-add/Shutterstock The Arashiyama Bamboo Grove, near the UNESCO site of Tenryu-ji Temple in the Arashiyama district, is one of Kyoto’s most photogenic sights. A walking path runs through the tranquil grove, lined by soaring stalks of bamboo. Known as bamboo alley, the green living tunnel has an otherworldly quality, especially when the giant fast-growing stems sway and rustle in the wind, causing the light to shift. It's absolutely mesmerising. Dancing Forest, Russia Henryk Sadura/Shutterstock The peculiar shape of the trees in Russia’s Dancing Forest – or the Drunken Forest, as it’s known by locals – has mystified visitors for years. It's not clear why the trunks of these pine trees have taken on such an unusual shape. But their mysterious twists, rings and loops are said to bring luck, with local superstitions dictating that climbing through one of the rings guarantees an extra year of life or a wish. The curious forest is found in Kaliningrad, Russia’s smallest province. These are the most magical places on Earth. Big Basin Redwoods State Park, USA Felix Lipov/Shutterstock One of the United States’ most impressive displays of soaring redwood trees can be found in California's Santa Cruz mountains. It's home to the Big Basin Redwoods State Park which has a sprawling collection of enormous and ancient coastal redwoods. With more than 80 miles (129km) of trails, there’s plenty of opportunity for hikers to get up close and gawp at the towering trees (the Redwood loop trail goes past some of the park’s oldest and tallest giants). Devastatingly, nearly all of Big Basin was affected by late summer wildfires in 2020, but ecologists say the largest redwoods should survive and others could re-sprout. Tarkine, Australia Kazuki Yamakawa/Shutterstock The little-visited Tarkine Forest Reserve in northwest Tasmania has been home to the Tasmanian Aboriginal Tarkiner people for 40,000 years. With its vast forests of moss-covered myrtle beech, leatherwood and pine trees, it's the greatest expanse of cool temperate rainforest in Australia, and the second largest in the world. This age-old forest is home to species that stem from when Australia was part of the ancient supercontinent Gondwanaland, and is a refuge for endangered native creatures including the last disease-free population of Tasmanian devils. Amazon Rainforest, various worldclassphoto/Shutterstock Spanning eight South American countries, the Amazon is undoubtedly the world’s most famous rainforest, containing 10% of the planet's known species, over 4,000 miles (6,400km) of winding rivers and 1.4 billion acres of dense forest. Despite being home to a mind-boggling amount of flora and fauna and over 30 million people, the Amazon is under threat not only from illegal logging and oil exploration but also from climate change, which has caused terrible droughts in recent years. Discover more natural wonders facing a perilous future. Monteverde Cloud Forest, Costa Rica englishinbsas/Shutterstock With hazy mist clinging to its treetops, Costa Rica’s Monteverde Cloud Forest is beautiful and intriguing. It's one of the world's rare cloud forests – habitats that can only be found in tropical or subtropical mountainous landscapes. Monteverde is famed for its biodiversity, and not just the flora here. There are over 400 species of birds and 1,200 species of amphibians and reptiles living throughout the reserve. Walkways run through parts of the forest’s canopy, as do ziplines – a high-adrenaline way to explore the lush foliage. Yakushima Island, Japan Philippe Sonderegger/Shutterstock Unspoiled and ancient, the forests of Yakushima, a subtropical mountainous island off the southern coast of Kyushu, are an ethereal place. Covered in 1,000-year-old Japanese cedar trees and dotted with clear rivers, hot springs and dramatic waterfalls, the island is one of Japan’s most beautiful natural wonders. The UNESCO World Heritage Site is a stunning place to hike, relax and spot wildlife – its twisted fairy-tale forest shelters the Yakushima macaque and the Yaku deer. Hoh Rainforest, USA Anton Foltin/Shutterstock Washington State’s Hoh Rainforest is another temperate rainforest with UNESCO World Heritage status. Home to both coniferous and deciduous species, its dazzling green beauty is down to the amount of rain that falls in this part of the Olympic Peninsula. Emerald-hued mosses dangle down from the damp forest’s towering trees: the sitka spruce, red cedar, big leaf maple and douglas fir which thrive here. Lichen grows everywhere and ferns unfurl on the overgrown forest floor. It’s also a special habitat for the endangered northern spotted owl. Crooked Forest, Poland Avillfoto/Shutterstock They look like they're straight out of a magical tale, but the gnarled buckled trunks of Poland’s Krzywy Las, or Crooked Forest, in northwest Poland are real. No one quite knows how this mysterious quirk of nature came about but one thing is for sure – the sight of the peculiar and identically-buckled form of the 400 or so pine trees is a surreal one. Now check out these stunning photos of Europe's best national parks. Białowieża Forest, Poland Aleksander Bolbot/Shutterstock The dense and sprawling Białowieża Forest, on the border between Poland and Belarus, is one of Europe’s last remaining primeval forests. It has centuries-old oak, elm and lime trees and is a protected UNESCO World Heritage reserve. It's also home to Europe’s largest population of bison (around 900) after the endemic species was reintroduced to the region. Fungi of all kinds can be found on its damp forest floor and 250 bird species, reptiles and other mammals also thrive here. Waipoua Forest, New Zealand Shaun Jeffers/Shutterstock The otherworldly forest of Waipoua at the tip of New Zealand’s North Island is a natural wonderland, with its towering kauri trees and rare wildlife. One of its sacred native trees, Tane Mahuta, also known as ‘the Lord of the Forest’, is the country’s largest kauri tree and is believed to be 2,000 years-old and still growing. Another, Te Matua Ngahere, or 'Father of the Forest’, is thought to be between 2,500 and 3,000 years-old. Sherwood Forest, England Steve Bramall/Shutterstock Steeped in myths and legends (most notably Robin Hood), Nottinghamshire’s Sherwood Forest still enthrals walkers with its swathes of ancient birch and knotted oak trees. The undisputed star of the woods is the enormous Major Oak, which according to folklore was Robin Hood’s shelter. It’s thought to be England's largest oak tree and could be anywhere between 800 and 1,100 years-old. The 450-acre park has over a thousand veteran oak trees in all, many of which are over 500 years-old. Caddo Lake, USA NicholasGeraldinePhotos/Shutterstock With Spanish-moss-draped cypresses reflected in its water, Caddo Lake is a spooky yet enchanting sight. The bayou (swampy lake) is not only visually spectacular, but an important habitat too. As one of the US’ largest flooded cypress forests, it supports several species of plants and animals living both within the lake and the upland forest. That’s not all that may be lurking here: it’s said Caddo Lake, which sits on the Texas-Louisiana border, was used as hideout for outlaws in the 19th century. These are Earth's most colourful natural wonders. Daintree Rainforest, Australia Tim Jessup/Shutterstock At around 135 million years-old, awe-inspiring Daintree is thought be the oldest rainforest in the world. The UNESCO-protected forest is home to the largest range of rare or threatened plant and animal species on Earth too, including giant ferns and the flightless southern cassowary. The prehistoric predator, the saltwater crocodile, also lurks in its rivers and creeks. The forest canopy at the Daintree Discovery Centre's walkway allows hikers to get high up in the trees, while guided night walks are a great time to see the forest come alive after dark. Galloway Forest Park, Scotland Rodney Hutchinson/Shutterstock The skies above this thick tangle of forest in Dumfries and Galloway are among the darkest in the world – so much so that it was awarded Dark Sky status in 2009. As well as a dazzling array of stars, this is when the resident owls and badgers come out to play down below. Red kites, red squirrels, roe deer, pine martens and otters are other inhabitants of the woods, lochs, rolling hills and moors, which make up the largest forest in the UK. Take a look at the world's most beautiful natural wonders. Valdivian forests, Argentina and Chile MAV Drone/Shutterstock Bookended by the Andes and the Pacific Ocean, the Valdivian forests of Chile and Argentina are the only temperate rainforests in South America. They share some of the same plant species found in Tasmania’s Tarkine and are a remnant from when the land was part of the ancient supercontinent of Gondwanaland, and connected to the forests of Australia and New Zealand. As well as native plants, these biodiverse forests are home to some extraordinary endemic creatures including a small tree-dwelling marsupial, the mountain monkey. Cedar forests, Lebanon kateafter/Shutterstock Some of Lebanon’s revered cedrus libani trees (which are referenced in the Bible and grow mainly here and in parts of Turkey) are thought to be up to 3,000 years-old. The trees once flourished across the country’s cool northern highlands but now only scattered groves exist, including its most famous, the Cedars of God, which is part of an UNESCO site. The densest cedar forest is the Tannourine Cedars Forest Nature Reserve. Sadly, the ancient giants’ days may be numbered due to millennia of deforestation and now the impact of global warming. Green Mountain National Forest, USA U.S. Forest Service - Green Mountain & Finger Lakes National Forests/Facebook With more native sugar maple trees than anywhere else in the US, Vermont is a leaf-peeper’s dream come fall. The verdant state’s forests are scenic all year but especially so when autumn brings its fantastic displays of red, orange and gold colours. The Green Mountain National Forest, in central and southwest Vermont, is laced with hiking trails, many with lofty ascents, perfect for ogling at the forest-covered mountains. Spiny forests, Madagascar Jiri Balek/Shutterstock The extraordinarily biodiverse island of Madagascar has a range of amazing native forests, including the surreal spiny forests that extend across its southern and southwestern part. Around 95% of the plant species in this weird and wonderful drought-resistant world are endemic to the eco-region. The thick and jagged tangle of foliage is also home to some curious creatures, including some regionally endemic species of lemur, Grandidier’s mongoose and the Madagascar radiated tortoise. Sadly, the spiny forests are under threat from deforestation and climate change. Laurisilva of Madeira, Portugal Dennis van de Water/Shutterstock Thanks to its temperate climate, Madeira is a hotbed of endemic and exotic plants. The verdant isle also has the largest laurel forest left in the world. The ancient forest covered large parts of southern Europe some 15–40 million years ago, but now only patches remain on Madeira, the Azores, the Canaries and Cape Verde. Madeira’s indigenous Laurissilva forest covers 15,000 hectares in the north of the isle, and the endemic Madeiran long-toed pigeon is among its inhabitants. It is part of the Madeira Natural Park which covers nearly two-thirds of the isle. Discover the world's most beautiful trees. Lake Kaindy, Kazakhstan Ruta Production/Shutterstock This surreal underwater forest can be found in Kazakhstan’s Tian Shan Mountains. After an earthquake in the early 20th century triggered a landslide, a natural dam was formed in the area, flooding the valley with water and submerging the spruce forest. These dead trees, schrenk spruce which are native to the mountains, are yet to decompose and make a haunting sight sticking out of the pretty lake which is surrounded by thickly forested slopes.

Here’s how to see some of the oldest forests on Earth. share this article Getting back to nature can be like going back in time—especially in the world’s most ancient wooded areas, some of which are home to the oldest life forms on Earth. Often in far-flung corners of the globe, travelers can easily plan an entire trip of one or two weeks around visiting these natural wonders. With many of us looking more toward destinations filled with nature as we venture back out into the world of travel, now is as good a time as any to daydream about hiking through these incredible landscapes. So get your hiking boots ready, and consider a visit to one of these ancient forests around the world. Photo by Kazuki Yamakawa/Shutterstock The Tarkine temperate rain forest in Tasmania, Australia 1. The Takayna/Tarkine Forest Australia Tasmania’s Takayna/Tarkine woodlands give a glimpse of what life on Earth looked like 300 million years ago. This temperate rain forest in Australia is home to the second oldest living tree species on the planet: the remarkable 3,000 year-old Huon pines. How to visit To explore this ethereal area blanketed with trees, waterfalls, rivers, caves, hills, and moorlands, book a tour with Tarkine Trails. Through it, you can make its hike-in Tiger Ridge glamping getaway, just over a half mile into Tasmania’s wilderness, your home base as you explore the surrounding trails. From the isolated camp, it leads four-day excursions through the most beautiful parts of the Tarkine, and if you’re lucky, you might even spot a Tasmanian devil. Photo by Julia Kokhanova/Shutterstock Chile’s national Araucaria pine, otherwise known as “monkey-puzzle tree,” in Conguillío National Park 2. The Araucaria Forest Chile The Chilean pine tree that spans the country’s Lake District is thought to have evolved its peculiar paintbrush shape to ward off herbivorous dinosaurs during the Jurassic period. The Araucaria tree, or Pehuén in the aboriginal Mapuche language, can live for approximately 1,000 years and grows in many parts of the Chilean Andes. However, the forest is most spectacular set against the backdrop of piercingly blue lakes and snowcapped volcanoes in Conguillío National Park. Head to Chile’s Araucanía region in November and you’ll catch the coning season, which yields pineapple-shaped conifers that produce seeds the indigenous Penuenche and Mapuche people use in local dishes. How to visit Conguillío National Park is located 70 miles from the city of Temuco and best accessed with your own vehicle. The nearest airport is La Araucanía, 15 miles south of Temuco, which services direct flights from Santiago. For those who want to take their time, campsites and cabins are available within the park and currently taking reservations. Photo by Alick To/Shutterstock The enchanted forests of Yakushima, Japan 3. Yakushima Forest Japan The moss-covered roots of Yakusugi trees, also known as Japanese cedars, have been steeping in the woods of Yakushima island for an estimated 7,000 years. This subtropical forest was considered so beautiful by Japan’s 17th-century royalty that the lush landscape was recreated in a garden on the mainland, and in 1993, the Yakushima Forest was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. Today, stepping into these fairy-tale-like woodlands is fairly straightforward: The Shiratani Unsuikyo Ravine offers low-intensity trails and the most easily accessible spots in the forest, including the landscape that inspired surreal anime classics like Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away. How to visit Article continues below advertisementTo get to Yakushima island, take a ferry or high-speed boat from Kagoshima, where the nearest airport is located. Once on the island, there is a range of accommodation options, including the luxurious Sankara Hotel & Spa (from $750/night, expedia.com), whose hillside location overlooks the ocean and subtropical forests, immersing guests in the property’s own natural beauty. Photo by Felix Lipov/Shutterstock Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest protected area in Inyo County, California 4. Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest California Located at nearly 10,000 feet in the California highlands in the Inyo National Forest, the Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest is home to some of the oldest living trees on Earth. The most ancient among the protected forest’s bristlecone pines—which are characterized by their unusual-looking twisted forms—is Methuselah, a tree estimated to be 4,841 years old. How to visit Inyo National Forest is a 3.5-hour drive from Los Angeles. Grandview Campground ($5 per night, first come first serve) is the closest to the Bristlecone Pine Forest. However, those looking for a little more comfort should consider a hotel or Airbnb in Bishop, which is an hour drive from Bristlecone. Photo by RPBaiao/Shutterstock Capybara at the shores of the Amazon rain forest in Manu National Park, Peru 5. The Amazon Rain Forest Brazil and Peru For 55 million years, the Amazon has been home to an astonishing array of wildlife—at least 10 percent of the world’s known biodiversity, to be exact. The region represents the largest remaining tropical rain forest in the world and spans the greater parts of Brazil and Peru (but also includes portions of Colombia, Ecuador, and Bolivia). How to visit In Peru, the easiest gateways to the rain forest are through Pulcallpa, Puerto Maldonado, and Iquitos on the country’s eastern border. In Brazil, the quickest Amazon entry point is through Manaus, which has an international airport. The depths of Amazonia are still largely inaccessible, but you can arrange rain forest tours in many regions along the jungle’s perimeters or join a five-day cruise down the Amazon river with Delfin Amazon Cruises. Photo by Shutterstock Cassowary Falls at Daintree rain forest in Queensland, Australia 6. Daintree Rain Forest Australia This ancient rain forest north of Brisbane is an estimated 180 million years old (which makes it more than twice the age of the Amazon). The Daintree region stretches approximately 460 square miles and is the largest continuous tropical rain forest in Australia. It’s also recognized as part of a UNESCO World Heritage site, the Wet Tropics of Queensland—one of the most significant regional ecosystems on the planet. In Daintree National Park, the Mount Sorrow ridge trail is about 4.5-miles long and takes between six and seven hours to hike, but the rewards are well worth it. The route leads you through the rain forest to a scenic viewpoint overlooking the Great Barrier Reef. How to visit Fly into Cairns, then rent a car to get you the rest of the way. It’s a 2.5-hour drive from Cairns to the Daintree Rain Forest, but you can break up the drive with a pit stop at Mossman Gorge or a seafood lunch at either Port Douglas or Palm Cove (we love NuNu’s for its fresh Australian fare). Book a stay in a tree house just outside the park at Daintree Ecolodge, where guests can literally sleep in the canopy. Photo by Aleksander Bolbo/Shutterstock Coniferous trees in Bialowieza Forest, Poland 7. Białowieża Forest Poland and Belarus Białowieża Forest is one of Europe’s last remaining stretches of old-growth forests. In the Middle Ages, the lowland forest served as hunting grounds for medieval kings and tsars. In the early 20th century, Poland and Belarus declared the area—which lies on the border of both countries—a national park, and in 1979 the forest became a UNESCO World Heritage site. Article continues below advertisementAt 580 square miles, Białowieża Forest isn’t difficult to explore. While hiking, keep an eye out for herds of European bison. After being liberated from zoos and brought to the forest by the government, roughly 900 of the endangered bison now roam freely and serve as a symbol of the woods. How to visit You can start in the village of Białowieża, Poland, or begin from Belarus in Brest or Kamyanyets. All three villages have low-key guesthouse and hotel options for hikers. Courtesy of Shutterstock Kauri tree growing in Waipoua Forest, Northland, New Zealand 8. Waipoua Forest New Zealand The oldest tree in this forest, known as Tāne Mahuta—or “Lord of the Forest”—is an estimated 2,300 years old and stands at 150 feet tall. This coniferous tree was one of many in Waipoua Forest that was almost wiped out when European settlers arrived in the 19th century and started cutting down kauri trees for wood. Luckily, the ancient forest in New Zealand was designated a sanctuary in 1952 and has since been left largely undamaged. How to visit To wander among these towering trees, rent a car in Auckland and drive three hours along the North Island’s coast. Stay in Dargaville and make the forest (an hour away) a day trip, or find a lodge close by to linger a bit longer. Photo by Monika Hrdinova/Shutterstock Avenue of the Baobabs, Madagascar 9. Avenue of the Baobabs Madagascar Hundreds of years ago, the ancient trees that line the Avenue of the Baobabs were part of a tropical forest dense with Adansonia grandidieri, a strikingly beautiful tree endemic to Madagascar. After years of deforestation, only around 20 of the species—commonly known as baobabs—still stand tall along the famous dirt road. In their peculiar shape and unique “upside-down” stature, these majestic trees are particularly imposing at dawn and dusk. How to visit The Avenue of the Baobabs is just a quick taxi ride from Morondava, a low-slung, easy-paced city on the west coast of Madagascar. The easiest way to get here is with a quick flight from the capital, Antananarivo (Tana, for short). For a more adventurous journey, hop on a two-week tour with Espace Mada and make your way there overland, canoeing down the Tsiribihina River, making a detour to the otherworldly rock formations of Tsingy de Bemaraha, and riding in 4x4s over the rough roads of rural Madagascar. Photo by Lee Prince/Shutterstock Misty Fjords National Monument in Tongass National Forest, Alaska 10. Tongass National Forest Alaska This temperate rain forest in Alaska is the largest national forest in the United States. At 16.7 million acres, Tongass National Forest takes up a vast stretch of southeast Alaska. The Tongass is home to some of the most well-preserved old-growth in North America—many of the trees are estimated to be over 800 years old. Deer Mountain trail, a difficult but popular 6.7-mile hike, traverses lush sections of the U.S. national forest. But don’t go trekking alone: Even the shorter routes are steep and challenging, and the area is filled with diverse wildlife, including wolves and grizzly bears. How to visit To find a local trekking guide, head to the nearby town of Ketchikan. Nicknamed the “Salmon Capital of the World,” fishing is the main draw for visitors. However, you’d be remiss to skip out on opportunities to hike and learn more about the native Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian tribes who call this area home. To absorb everything the area has to offer, book a room at Waterfall Resort (call 800-544-5125 for reservation and prices) or Cape Fox Lodge (from $165/night; expedia.com) and stay a few days.

The winding approach takes tourists through crowded hill station towns and rolling green tea fields before ascending into the misty mountaintops of mainland Malaysia. Don’t miss a climb to the viewpoint at the summit of Gunung Brinchang. And bring your boots -- your footsteps in the moss will fill with water as you take each step.Thrillist TVHistory ofS1 E26The History of 7-ElevenDaniel-life/ShutterstockHumboldt Redwoods State ParkCaliforniaBest accessed from: A drive along the 32-mile Avenue of the Giants provides a humbling intro to these ancient trees. You will feel like an insignificant insect. An ant.  Best hike: While the Founders Grove Nature Trail is popular for its impressive heights, the Rockefeller Loop at the Bull Creek Flats is less crowded and just as towering.If huge old-growth trees are your thing, a visit the redwoods of northern California is probably your best bet. Humboldt Redwoods State Park is one of the best places to be immersed in the state’s redwood forests, and three of the world’s ten tallest trees are located in the park’s Bull Creek Flats area alone. Yes -- you can drive through a giant tree here. Just don’t try to hug one, unless you have freakishly long arms.THPStock/ShutterstockGreat Otway National ParkVictoria, AustraliaBest accessed from: The Great Ocean Road, which begins west of Melbourne in Torquay.Best hike: The Maits Rest boardwalk trail offers a short, easy walk through the lush landscape of Great Otway’s inland temperate rainforest.Inland from Australia’s famed Great Ocean Road, the cool rainforests of the Great Otway National Park are home to massive tree ferns and cackling kookaburras. The rainforest is dotted with impressive waterfalls like the Erskine and Henderson falls, and in the park’s south, swaying eucalyptus trees along Otway Lighthouse Road teem with lazy koalas.Filipe Frazao/ShutterstockAmazon rainforestSouth AmericaBest accessed from: Iquitos, Peru is one of this massive jungle’s best jump-off points.Best hike: Most tours take place on the river, but several lodges near Iquitos offer access to a canopy walkway where the forest can be viewed from the top, down.The Earth’s largest rainforest spans over eight countries and 1.4 billion acres. It’s fertilized (via natural phenomenon) by dust from Africa’s Sahara Desert and it’s home to jaguars, pink dolphins, toucans and -- our Saturday morning spirit animal -- sloths. Not to mention the isolated tribes who still live in this forest and are lucky enough to not know that Facebook is a thing.Chris Howey/ShutterstockArashiyama Bamboo GroveKyoto, JapanBest accessed from: This big bunch of bamboo is easily reached via Kyoto’s public bus and train systems.Best hike: The only trail here leads straight through the bamboo grove, leaving little room for error and providing a calming break from the language barrier you’ve probably been suffering under.Trust us: the growth exhibited in this bamboo grove is IMPRESSIVE. Since sharing pics on social media became the main reason to travel, there’s zero chance you’ll have this grove to yourself, but the green-tinged walk through the towering bamboo stalks here has an undeniable otherworldly appeal nonetheless. Be quiet, and you’ll be able to experience the government-recognized sound of the bamboo stalks bumping with the wind.Oscity/ShutterstockBlack ForestGermanyBest accessed from: Baden-Baden, where a soak at the spa is the perfect follow up to a day in the woods.Best hike: The region is known for its long-distance hikes (the famous Westweg Trail spans almost 200 miles), but from Baden Baden, the impressive Hohebaden Castle ruins can be reached in under an hour.Hiking was allegedly invented in the Black Forest (assuming, you know, that hiking needed to be invented), but the region that inspired the fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm truly offers explorers a happy ending. Many trails here culminate at a “vesperstuben” -- a German take on the snack bar that offers local specialties like Black Forest gateau and Black Forest ham. And beer. It’s Germany, after all.Noah Strycker/ShutterstockTandayapa Cloud ForestEcuadorBest accessed from: Quito -- Ecuador’s capital -- lies about  two hours south of this misty region. Several lodges offer accommodation within the forest.Best hike: Near Mindo, Casa Amarilla (yes, it’s a yellow house) welcomes visitors on the trails that crisscross its property for a small fee.Colorful bird, plant, and insect life bring this damp, mountainous jungle alive. Keep a lookout for hummingbirds (you won’t have to look hard) and toucans, orchids, and air plants that look like they belong in an Urban Outfitters. Birdwatchers here are almost as prolific as the birds themselves, so be open to trying new hobbies.Ethan Daniels/ShutterstockKelp Forest at the Monterey Bay AquariumCaliforniaBest accessed from: Monterey Bay, California, where several dive shops operate daily dives.Best dive site: The Breakwater is one of the state’s most popular dive sites, for its swaying strands of giant kelp and playful seals and otters. Point Lobos will do the trick, too.The turbulent Pacific waters off of California’s coast provide the perfect supply of nutrients for fast-growing giant kelp, which can gain 10-12 inches in just one day and have formed dense underwater forests along the shores of Monterey. If you are not for SCUBA, the renowned Monterey Bay Aquarium is home to a groundbreaking kelp forest exhibit where local inhabitants include sardines, leopard sharks, and eels. If you do the dive yourself, sea lion sightings are almost guaranteed.FSCAFEINE/ShutterstockSian Ka’an Coastal Biosphere ReserveMexicoBest accessed from: Tulum -- tour companies in Cancun’s hip neighbor will arrange day trips to Sian Ka’an, but the more adventurous may be able to reach the Muyil entrance to the park via public transport.Best hike: Aside from a couple of short walks through the jungle here, the focus is on a boat tour through a submerged forest of mangroves along the ocean’s edge.Once you hop in a boat at Muyil, Mayan-dug canals through sprawling tracts mangroves are at your fingertips. Though this reserve is home to plenty of crocs, the canal waters are crystal clear, and most tours climax in a current-driven, boatless free-float. Look for dolphins and sea turtles amongst the mangroves, but don’t expect to set eyes on any of the five species of wildcats that call this reserve home -- they like to play at night.Dennis van de Water/ShutterstockTsingy de Bemaraha National ParkMadagascarBest accessed from: Morondava, via an 8-hour drive on the worst road you can possibly imagine.Best hike: Any hike through the reserve’s Big Tsingy section with a guide that will keep you from getting lost, dying, or being impaled by terrifying spikey rocks.OK, so this is more of a rock forest, per say, but the main draw at Tsingy is the ancient limestone formations that cover the 230-square-mile UNESCO site. A day-long trek through the region’s cave-like crevices and across janky rope bridges reveals a look into the life of 11 types of lemur, camouflaged chameleons, and various species of birds. Just be sure to focus on your footwork.Sign up here for our daily Thrillist email, and get your fix of the best in food/drink/fun.Elspeth Velten is a contributing writer for Thrillist who once spent a day hiking through a Malaysian forest in search of an enormous, elusive flower that is known for its scent... of ripe, rotting meat.

236,"Forest Philanthropy Action Network Protecting and restoring forest carbon in tropical Africa: A guide for donors and funders This report on forests in tropical Africa is the first to be published by the Forests Philanthropy Action Network (FPAN). The culmination of nearly two years of desk and field research, it provides an introduction and some initial guidance on important questions such as: which interventions to protect and restore Africa's tropical forest carbon are likely to be successful? Under what circumstances? And how can donors and funders engage most effectively. Protecting and restoring forest carbon in tropical Africa is vital reading for philanthropic donors, public funding bodies and forest carbon companies interested in supporting efforts to halt the loss of tropical forests in Africa. The report was made possible by the generous support of the Pure Climate Foundation, the David & Lucile Packard Foundation, the Leventis family, the Linden Trust for Conservation, and the Wetland Trust. Read more about FPAN and the report Annex 1: The ProForest Report FPAN commissioned ProForest, forest research organisation based in Oxford, UK, to conduct a review of the primary data on forest carbon in tropical Africa found in peer-review journals. The outcome of this research, Terrestrial carbon: emissions, sequestration and storage in tropical Africa, is also available for download from this website. About FPAN FPAN is a charity founded by Nicholas Josefowitz and Bernard Mercer in 2008. It exists to encourage donors and funders to take an interest in protecting and enhancing forests; to foster informed debate on forest issues; and to produce research-based guidance for trusts, foundations and individual donors who want to support effective action on forests.

We calculate the charity's average expenses and average contributions over its three most recent fiscal years.Source: IRS Form 990Working Capital Ratio1.15 yearsDetermines how long a charity could sustain its level of spending using its net available assets, or working capital, as reported on its most recently filed Form 990. We include in a charity's working capital unrestricted and temporarily restricted net assets, and exclude permanently restricted net assets. Dividing these net available assets in the most recent year by a charity's average total expenses, yields the working capital ratio. We calculate the charity's average total expenses over its three most recent fiscal years.Source: IRS Form 990Program Expense Growth2.12%We compute the average annual growth of program expenses using the following formula: [(Yn/Y0)(1/n)]-1, where Y0 is a charity's program expenses in the first year of the interval analyzed, Yn is the charity's program expenses in the most recent year, and n is the interval of years passed between Y0 and Yn.Source: IRS Form 990GovernanceCharity Navigator looks to confirm on the Form 990 that the organization has these governance practices in place.Sources Include: IRS Form 990Governance:Independent Voting Board MembersNo Material Diversion of AssetsAudited Financials Prepared by Independent AccountantDoes Not Provide Loan(s) to or Receive Loan(s) From Related PartiesDocuments Board Meeting MinutesDistributes 990 to Board Before FilingCompensates BoardPoliciesCharity Navigator looks to confirm on the Form 990, or for some metrics on the charity's website, that the organization has these policies in place.

Our partnership with Feedback Labs and Guidestar by Candid, and other partners including Fund for Shared Insight, GlobalGiving, and Keystone Accountability, enables us to launch the first version of this beacon with Constituent Feedback information collected on Candid's site.Feedback practices have been shown to support better Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion outcomes, an essential area of assessment that we intend to further expand and develop in the future. Feedback Labs has documented several studies which indicate that beyond achieving organizational goals, nonprofits that are attentive and responsive to concerns and ideas raised by beneficiaries establish stronger relationships with the people they serve, promote greater equity, and empower constituents in ways that can help to ensure better long-term outcomes.

Cities which provide a healthy, safe, productive and supportive environment. Cities which are in harmony with the surrounding environment, cultural traditions and spiritual values, taking into account the diversity of their country. We want cities for life with which people can identify themselves and participate actively in their development. Cities in which people are proud of their culture and the environment in which they live. Mission We are a national network set up as a non-profit civil association consisting of three kinds of institutional actors: local governments, universities and civil society organizations (NGOs, grassroots organizations and business associations). With the participation of these actors Foro generates alliances and provides a space in which common goals can be pursued. We seek to encourage, raise awareness, facilitate and promote opportunities for consensus to develop and manage our cities in accordance with the principles of the UN’s Agenda 21, and to support training institutions to do the same thing. The joint activities of the Forum are focused on research, policy advocacy, leadership training and developing programs for sustainable urban development. In addition, Foro partners run specific projects in their local areas in line with our mission and objectives. Main achievements Foro’s main achievements after 18 years of working together: Capacity Building: through seminars, masters degrees, postgraduate courses and e-learning on issues related to city-wide sustainable development such as Urban Environmental Management, Local Agenda 21, Territorial Planning, Sustainable Construction, Cities and Climate Change, Water Governance and Green Infrastructure. The Social Construction of Knowledge and its inherent dissemination: building collective knowledge through case studies, manuals, handbooks and guides (from first-hand experiences and lessons learned from our members) as well as the publication of books, mailing lists, our web page and our participatory research projects. Creation of streams of opinions in favour of Integrated Territorial (Spatial) and City-Wide Participatory and Concerted Planning, budgeting and implementation. Planning in line with sustainability approaches which take into account environmental issues, for example: the responsible use of natural resources. Contribution to the creation of a Multiple Level Institutional Framework (National, Regional and Local) for city environmental management. Using political incidence campaigns, formulation of Sustainable Development Plans (and other related plans such as Climate Change Strategies) at city level, nation-wide law proposals, municipal laws, debates, forums, opening spaces for dialogue and consensus building. Some Proyects (2011 – 2014) Urban chances. The growth of cities and the challenge of sustainability Comparing rapidly growing cities in emerging economies. Chance2Sustain is a research project examining how governments and citizens in Peru, India, South Africa and Brazilian cities with differing patterns of urban economic growth make use of participatory (or integrated) spatial knowledge management to direct urban and water governance facing climate change towards more resilient and sustainable development. A legal framework providing for fiscal decentralisation and funding, for instance, is a strategic support. The research tackle issues which have not yet been analysed much locally, and certainly not comparatively across different socio- political contexts, although it is a strategic question, given the inherent trade-offs and potential political conflicts in combining (and integrating) environmental, social and economic goals (within sustainable development). Therefore, the programme focuses on ten cities with contrasting economic and political conditions, with the main scientific objective of developing a model on participatory spatial knowledge management to direct urban governance to sustainable development. Among its partners are UvA, EADI, CEIAS-CNRS, NIBR, UKZN, Cities for Life Forum, SPA and CEBRAP. www.chance2sustain.eu Sustainable water management and waste water in urban centers in growth coping with climate change. Concepts for Metropolitan Lima- Peru . LiWa focusses on the development and application of fundamental procedures and tools for participatory decision making, based on informed discussions for sustainable planning and management prioritizing one of the crucial lifelines – water and sanitation and the promotion of water related energy efficiency. This is being done in Lima, with particularly adverse boundary conditions due to the expected impacts of climate change. Research carried out in the project builds upon previous studies and investigations of the consortium partners. Furthermore, potential technologies of wastewater disposal and treatment have been analysed. Also, a preliminary version of a macro-modelling tool, simulating water and wastewater fluxes in Lima, facilitating analysis of scenarios and variants, assisting stakeholder discussions and decision making, has been set up as well as the development of water tariffs proposals and the strategy for ecological infrastructure for Lima city as a whole. www.lima-water.de Development Strategy for Climate Change Adaptation for the Sustainable planning of Lima. The aim is to promote and contribute to the development of a concerted process for the preparation of the Adaptation Climate Change Strategy for Metropolitan Lima advising and coaching the MML / PGRLM team and the Technical Group Climate Change to compile, systematize and analyse the information about Lima climatic vulnerability of Lima before the climate variavility facing the plausible scenarios as a basis for the development the Strategy and its Action Plan for future implementation.

EL TIEMPO Dic 12.19Provincia El Foro Soria 21 para el Desarrollo Sostenible participa en la COP 25 de Chile Amalio de Marichalar Marichalar destaca que los trabajos que Soria había realizado a principios de 2000 fueron pioneros en sostenibilidad Amalio de Marichalar, Conde de Ripalda, presidente del Foro Soria 21 para el Desarrollo Sostenible, ha participado en diversas sesiones de la COP 25 (Conferencia de las Partes del Convenio Marco de Naciones Unidas sobre el Cambio Climático) como en la de la IUCN (Unión Internacional para la Conservación de la Naturaleza), la de la International Chamber of Commerce, en las sesiones de debate de Cambio Climático de Naciones Unidas, etc., así como muy particularmente ha estado con la Delegación de Chile; donde ha podido exponer lo que debe ser el plan de acción hacia la sostenibilidad y en concreto en la aminoración de las consecuencias y lucha contra el cambio climático, sumándose desde el Foro al compromiso de la lucha por la no subida de 2 grados con el objetivo necesario de 1,5 grados para lograr 0 grados en el 2050. En ello se basa el porvenir de la humanidad en este momento histórico. El Foro ha pedido que si bien todos somos responsables, son los gobiernos los que han de dar el paso definitivo para implementar todos los acuerdos de París y en concreto el de financiación de todas las medidas, ya que hay una responsabilidad compartida pero diferenciada. Ha explicado también que en los cerca de 30 años de actividad que viene desarrollando por la sostenibilidad, es este el momento más maduro para el plan de acción pues la concienciación es ya plena en empresas, universidades, científicos, ONGs, juventud, medios de comunicación y conjunto de la sociedad civil. Amalio de Marichalar ha destacado así mismo que en el 2001, en Soria, bajo la Presidencia de S.A.R., el Principe de Asturias, el Subsecretario de Naciones Unidas, Maurice Strong, propuso para Soria y para España la creación de una nueva Agencia de Naciones Unidas en Desarrollo Sostenible, por los trabajos que Soria había realizado, pioneros en sostenibilidad, cuestión hoy trascendental en la que se sigue trabajando y queriendo honrar la memoria de Maurice Strong que tanto trabajó para lograrlo, viéndose culminada su labor en los acuerdos de París. Así mismo, Marichalar quiso honrar la permanente ayuda y consejo de Ricardo Díez-Hochleitner, Presidente del Club de Roma, sin el cual nada de lo que Soria representa hoy como iniciativa en Desarrollo Sostenible, reconocida mundialmente, se hubiera logrado, y por su permanente compromiso por la educación como base esencial de un desarrollo sostenible e inteligente. Añadió Marichalar que es precisamente la educación y la cultura, entendida como la mejor herencia moral de la sociedad, el cuarto pilar del desarrollo sostenible en el que trabaja el Foro en estos últimos años gracias a lo que viene desarrollando desde Portugal junto a los Foros de Lisboa y Oporto para el desarrollo sostenible y en donde conjuntamente se acordó exponer el ejemplo universal de Numancia que tanto une a los dos países y que representa el paradigma mundial de la libertad, como un icono de la unión entre cultura y sostenibilidad, y considerándose todo esto ya como innovador y estratégico ya que es la cultura el resumen de lo mejor que conoce la humanidad y los valores que lo enmarcan, pieza esencial para que los decisores pongan en marcha los acuerdos de París cumpliendo lo firmado ya que es una obligación moral, como bien señala el presidente Piñera, más allá de la del tratado internacional, y que representa la fuerza de los más importantes valores y derechos humanos, que se han de proteger.

Manifiesto Cómo participar Contagiando En boca de otros Galería Sala de prensa Historias que merecen ser contadas Amalio de Marichalar, Foro Soria 21 para el Desarrollo Sostenible: principios y valores para salir de la crisis febrero 4, 2010 Amalio de Marichalar / Presidente / Foro Soria 21 para el Desarrollo Sostenible Desde el Foro Soria 21 para el Desarrollo Sostenible, organización de ámbito nacional e internacional sin ánimo de lucro, creemos que una de las principales razones por las que estamos inmersos en esta crisis global es la falta de adopción de criterios éticos, valores y principios en el conjunto de la sociedad y que afectan también al desarrollo de la actividad empresarial. Precisamente por ello creemos firmemente que en un momento de crisis global como en el que nos encontramos debemos tornar el planteamiento hacia un desarrollo económico basado en principios y valores sólidos que lleguen a todos los estamentos de la sociedad: el Desarrollo Sostenible. Ahí está la base de la recuperación. Para ello, en el Foro Soria 21 luchamos cada día para ser inspiradores de un proceso de desarrollo sostenible que sirva a las personas sin servirse de ellas. Así, trabajamos bajo los principios de la Agenda 21 para transformar el modelo de desarrollo, basado en la explotación limitada de los recursos combinado con la aplicación de nuevas tecnologías y la innovación, en un nuevo modelo de desarrollo que satisfaga las necesidades actuales pensando en las generaciones futuras. Aspiramos a que nuestra propuesta se convierta en un modelo mundial del Desarrollo Sostenible, en un gran laboratorio de ideas y proyectos, impulsando el cuidado de la Naturaleza sobre la base de las Agendas 21 locales y el impulso a la Carta de la Tierra como base ética de todas las actuaciones Amalio de Marichalar / Presidente / Foro Soria 21 para el Desarrollo Sostenible VN:F [1.9.6_1107]por favor, espere...Rating: 10.0/10 (2 votes cast)Amalio de Marichalar, Foro Soria 21 para el Desarrollo Sostenible: principios y valores para salir de la crisis, 10.0 out of 10 based on 2 ratings Comparte Comments are closed.

EFE Publicado por: Redacción EFEverde 14 noviembre, 2017 Bonn (Alemania) La asociación Foro Soria 21 para el Desarrollo Sostenible ha participado en las sesiones de la cumbre de cambio climático de Naciones Unidas, la COP 23 de Bonn (Alemania) sobre la hoja de ruta técnica para calcular la equivalencia en dióxido de carbono de los gases de efecto invernadero. El presidente la entidad, Amalio de Marichalar, ha propuesto como “cuestión estratégica e innovadora” que la cultura condicione el compromiso definitivo de los decisores para poner en marcha los acuerdos de París y ha puesto en valor el potencial de la población celtíbera Numancia, “que representa uno de los orígenes más simbólicos de España”, según un comunicado facilitado. Marichalar se ha reunido junto con la delegación española con las comisiones de China, Alemania, Francia, entre otras, para explicar los avances conseguidos en los últimos años con la ayuda de Portugal y los Foros de Lisboa y Oporto en materia de desarrollo sostenible. Asimismo, Foro Soria 21 ha solicitado a Estados Unidos su vuelta plena a los acuerdos, “por ser impulsor de los mismos”, ya que considera que “con el diálogo sincero se puede reconsiderar una posición que sin duda es necesaria abordar en beneficio de todos los países”, sobre todo teniendo en cuenta “los recientes testimonios trágicos producidos por el cambio climático tanto en Estados Unidos, en Europa y en Oriente”. Implementación del Acuerdo de París La asociación también ha formado parte de las sesiones de la puesta en marcha y la implementación práctica del Acuerdo de París en asuntos como la financiación, “donde los países desarrollados han de mostrar su compromiso de cara a los países en vías de desarrollo”, según la nota facilitada. Además, el compromiso de no elevar el calentamiento global “es una de las materia en la que las partes están más focalizadas en Bonn”, lo además significa “enviar una señal comprometida a los mercados, para comprobar que el mundo se mueve en la dirección positiva”.

El presidente del Foro Soria 21 para el Desarrollo Sostenible, Amalio de Marichalar, Conde de Ripalda, ha entregado en la clausura de la COP 25 de Chile,  sendas cartas al secretario general de Naciones Unidas, Antonio Guterres, a la presidenta de la COP 25 de Chile, Carolina Schmidt, ministra de Medioambiente de Chile,  y a la secretaria ejecutiva de Cambio Climático de Naciones Unidas, Patricia Espinosa, haciendo un breve resumen de los trabajos del Foro por el desarrollo sostenible y su plan de acción; y la importancia de incluir en la agenda a la cultura, que reafirma los más firmes valores de la sociedad a lo largo de siglos, tal y como enseña Numancia, como pilar esencial de la sostenibilidad e indicando además en dichas cartas, que ello ha sido propuesto en los estudios del Foro realizados en Portugal, junto a sus socios portugueses ya que es el eje estratégico para la toma de decisión efectiva. A lo largo de la mañana, Marichalar ha afirmado además que Numancia es el símbolo mundial que reafirma el origen de la libertad y de los valores imperecederos que urgentemente necesita la humanidad. Es la educación en valores lo más importante para lograr los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible y ha puesto como ejemplo las tres ediciones del concurso escolar ¿Qué es Numancia para ti? que se realiza en Soria, para comprender lo que Numancia nos enseña desde hace veintidós siglos y reafirmando así mismo, en distintas sesiones la importancia que para esta COP y para la siguiente en Glasgow, tiene llegar a los objetivos de no superar 1,5 grados y por tanto las decisiones urgentes que en materia de financiación hay que adoptar y poner en marcha. Por último ha agradecido profundamente a Chile, en su delegación, pidiendo que transmitieran al presidente Piñera el firme reconocimiento a su labor de liderazgo mundial en la COP de Chile urgiéndonos a poner en marcha un desarrollo sostenible como exigencia moral que todos debemos acometer y agradeciendo profundamente también a todos los chilenos y al frente, la ministra de Medioambiente, Carolina Schmidt, presidente de la COP de Chile por el ejemplo que Chile ha dado al mundo en la COP y la necesidad de seguir contando a pocas horas del cierre de la cumbre, con su permanente liderazgo.

The region stretches from the Atlantic Ocean in the west to the Arabian Sea in the east, and from the Mediterranean Sea in the north to the Indian Ocean in the southeast.[6] The eastern part of the Arab world is known as the Mashriq, and the western part as the Maghreb. Arabic is used as the lingua franca throughout the Arab world. Malta, an island country in Southern Europe whose national language also derives from Arabic (through Sicilian Arabic), is not included in the region. Similarly, Chad, Eritrea, and Israel recognize Arabic as one of their official or working languages but are not included in the region because they are not members of the Arab League (although Chad and Eritrea applied for full membership in 2014). The Arab world has a combined population of around 422 million inhabitants (as of 2012)[11] and a gross domestic product of $2.782 trillion (2018). In post-classical history, the Arab world was synonymous with the historic Arab empires and caliphates. Arab nationalism arose in the second half of the 19th century along with other nationalist movements within the Ottoman Empire. The Arab League was formed in 1945 to represent the interests of Arab people and especially to pursue the political unification of the Arab countries; a project known as Pan-Arabism.[12][13] Contents 1 Definition 1.1 Standard territorial definition 1.1.1 Member states of the Arab League 1.2 Ancillary linguistic definition 2 Arab League states 3 Demographics 3.1 Religion 3.2 Education 3.3 Gender equality and women's rights 3.3.1 Child marriages 3.3.2 Violence 3.4 Largest cities in the Arab world 4 History 4.1 Early history 4.2 Ottoman and colonial rule 4.3 Rise of Arab nationalism 4.4 Modern conflicts 4.4.1 Unification of Saudi Arabia 4.4.2 Arab–Israeli conflict 4.4.3 Iraq–Iran War 4.4.4 Lebanese Civil War 4.4.5 Western Sahara conflict 4.4.6 North Yemen Civil War 4.4.7 Somali Civil War 4.4.8 Arab Spring 4.5 Petroleum 4.6 Recent history 5 States and territories 5.1 Forms of government 5.2 Modern boundaries 5.3 Modern economies 6 Geography 6.1 Historical boundaries 6.1.1 Arab Africa 6.1.2 Arab Western Asia 7 See also 8 Notes 8.1 General 8.2 Sources 9 References 10 Further reading 11 External links Definition The linguistic and political denotation inherent in the term Arab is generally dominant over genealogical considerations. In Arab states, Standard Arabic is used by the government. Local vernacular languages are referred to as Darija (الدَّارِجَة ""everyday/colloquial language""[14]) in the Maghreb or Aammiyya (لعَامِيَّة ""common language"") in the Mashreq. The majority of the vocabulary in these vernaculars is shared with Standard Arabic, but they also significantly borrow from other languages, such as Berber, French, Spanish and Italian in the Maghreb.[15] Standard territorial definition Main article: Arab League Although no globally accepted definition of the Arab world exists,[6] all countries that are members of the Arab League are generally acknowledged as being part of the Arab world.[6][16] The Arab League is a regional organisation that aims (among other things) to consider in a general way the affairs and interests of the Arab countries and sets out the following definition of an Arab: An Arab is a person whose language is Arabic, who lives in an Arabic country, and who is in sympathy with the aspirations of the Arabic people.[17] This standard territorial definition is sometimes seen to be inappropriate[18] or problematic,[19] and may be supplemented with certain additional elements (see ancillary linguistic definition below).[20] Member states of the Arab League Main article: Member states of the Arab League Algeria (Arabic: الجزائر‎ al-Jazā’ir) (Tamazight is the other official language, French is used in education, daily life and business) Bahrain (Arabic: البحرين‎ al-Baḥrayn) Comoros (Arabic: جزر القمر‎ Juzur al-Qamar) (Comorian and French are the other official languages) Djibouti (Arabic: جيبوتي‎ Jībūtī) (French is the other official language) Egypt (Arabic: مصر‎ Miṣr) Iraq (Arabic: العراق‎ al-‘Irāq) (Kurdish is the other official language (minority)) Jordan (Arabic: الأردن‎ al-Urdun) Kuwait (Arabic: الكويت‎ al-Kuwayt) Lebanon (Arabic: لبنان‎ Lubnān) Libya (Arabic: ليبيا‎ Lībyā) Mauritania (Arabic: موريتانيا‎ Mūrītānyā) Morocco (Arabic: المغرب‎ al-Maghrib) (Tamazight is the other official language, French is used in education, daily life and business) Oman (Arabic: عمان‎ ‘Umān) Palestinian territories (Arabic: فلسطين‎ Filasṭīn) Qatar (Arabic: قطر‎ Qaṭar) Saudi Arabia (Arabic: المملكة العربية السعودية‎ al-Mamlakah al-‘Arabīyah as-Sa‘ūdīyah) Somalia (Arabic: الصومال‎ aṣ-Ṣūmāl) (Somali is the other official language) Sudan (Arabic: السودان‎ as-Sūdān) Syria (Arabic: سوريا‎ Sūryā) Tunisia (Arabic: تونس‎ Tūnis) United Arab Emirates (Arabic: الإمارات العربيّة المتّحدة‎ al-Imārāt al-‘Arabīyah al-Muttaḥidah) Yemen (Arabic: اليمن‎ al-Yaman) Ancillary linguistic definition Main article: Arabic language As an alternative to,[21] or in combination with,[6] the standard territorial definition, the Arab world may be defined as consisting of peoples and states united to at least some degree by Arabic language, culture or geographic contiguity,[22] or those states or territories in which the majority of the population speaks Arabic, and thus may also include populations of the Arab diaspora.[6] When an ancillary linguistic definition is used in combination with the standard territorial definition, various parameters may be applied[clarification needed] to determine whether a state or territory should be included in this alternative definition of the Arab world. These parameters may be applied[clarification needed] to the states and territories of the Arab League (which constitute the Arab world under the standard definition) and to other states and territories. Typical parameters that may be applied include: whether Arabic is widely spoken; whether Arabic is an official or national language; or whether an Arabic cognate language is widely spoken. While Arabic dialects are spoken in a number of Arab League states, Literary Arabic is official in all of them. Several states have declared Arabic to be an official or national language, although Arabic is not as widely spoken there. As members of the Arab League, however, they are considered part of the Arab world under the standard territorial definition. Somalia has two official languages, Arabic and Somali, both of which belong to the larger Afro-Asiatic language family. Although Arabic is widely spoken by many people in the north and urban areas in the south, Somali is the most widely used language, and contains many Arabic loan words.[23] Similarly, Djibouti has two official languages, Arabic and French. It also has several formally recognized national languages; besides Somali, many people speak Afar, which is also an Afro-Asiatic language. The majority of the population speaks Somali and Afar, although Arabic is also widely used for trade and other activities.[24] The Comoros has three official languages: Arabic, Comorian and French. Comorian is the most widely spoken language, with Arabic having a religious significance, and French being associated with the educational system. Chad, Eritrea[25] and Israel all recognize Arabic as an official or working language, but none of them is a member-state of the Arab League, although both Chad and Eritrea are observer states of the League (with possible future membership) and have large populations of Arabic speakers. Israel is not part of the Arab world. By some definitions,[20][26] Arab citizens of Israel may concurrently be considered a constituent part of the Arab world. Iran has about 1.5 million Arabic speakers.[27] Iranian Arabs are mainly found in Ahvaz, a southwestern region in the Khuzestan Province; others inhabit the Bushehr and Hormozgan provinces and the city of Qom. Mali and Senegal recognize Hassaniya, the Arabic dialect of the Moorish ethnic minority, as a national language.[28] Greece and Cyprus also recognize Cypriot Maronite Arabic under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. Additionally, Malta, though not part of the Arab world, has as its official language Maltese. The language is grammatically akin to Maghrebi Arabic.

Various indigenous languages are also spoken, which predate the spread of the Arabic language. This contrasts with the situation in the wider Islamic world, where, in contiguous Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan, the Perso-Arabic script is used and Arabic is the primary liturgical language, but the tongue is not official at the state level or spoken as a vernacular. Arabs constitute around one quarter of the 1.5 billion Muslims in the Islamic world.[31] Religion This article needs to be updated. The reason given is: Relating to the Arab world survey conducted by the BBC. (https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-48703377). Please update this section to reflect recent events or newly available information. (June 2019) The majority of people in the Arab world adhere to Islam, and the religion has official status in most countries. Shariah law exists partially in the legal system in some countries (especially in the Arabian peninsula), while others are legislatively secular. The majority of the Arab countries adhere to Sunni Islam. Iraq and Bahrain, however, are Shia majority countries, while Lebanon, Yemen, and Kuwait have large Shia minorities. In Saudi Arabia, Ismailite pockets are also found in the eastern Al-Hasa region and the southern city of Najran. Ibadi Islam is practiced in Oman, where Ibadis constitute around 75% of Muslims. There are also Christian adherents in the Arab world, particularly in Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Jordan, and Palestine. Coptic, Maronite and Assyrian Christian enclaves exist in the Nile Valley, Levant and northern Iraq respectively. There are also Assyrian, Armenian, Syriac-Aramean and Arab Christians throughout Iraq, Syria, Palestine, Lebanon and Jordan. Smaller ethno-religious minorities across the Arab League include the Yezidis, Yarsan and Shabaks (mainly in Iraq), the Druzes (mainly in Syria and also in Lebanon, Jordan) and Mandaeans (in Iraq). Formerly, there were significant minorities of Jews throughout the Arab World. However, the Arab–Israeli conflict prompted their mass exodus between 1948 and 1972. Today small Jewish communities remain, ranging anywhere from just 10 in Bahrain, to more than 1,000 in Tunisia and some 3,000 in Morocco. Historically, slavery in the Muslim world developed out of pre-Islamic practices of slavery in the Arab world.[32][33] Education Main article: Higher Education in the Arab World According to UNESCO, the average rate of adult literacy (ages 15 and older) in this region is 76.9%. In Mauritania and Yemen, the rate is lower than the average, at barely over 50%. Syria, Lebanon, Palestine and Jordan record a high adult literacy rate of over 90%.[citation needed] The average rate of adult literacy shows steady improvement, and the absolute number of adult illiterates fell from 64 million to around 58 million between 1990 and 2000–2004. Overall, the gender disparity in adult literacy is high in this region, and of the illiteracy rate, women account for two-thirds, with only 69 literate women for every 100 literate men. The average GPI (Gender Parity Index) for adult literacy is 0.72, and gender disparity can be observed in Egypt, Morocco, and Yemen. Above all, the GPI of Yemen is only 0.46 in a 53% adult literacy rate.[34] According to a UN survey, in the Arab world, the average person reads four pages a year and one new title is published each year for every 12,000 people.[35] The Arab Thought Foundation reports that just above 8% of people in Arab countries aspire to get an education.[35] Literacy rate is higher among the youth than adults. Youth literacy rate (ages 15–24) in the Arab region increased from 63.9 to 76.3% from 1990 to 2002. The average rate of GCC States *Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (GCC) Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (GCC) was 94%, followed by the Maghreb at 83.2% and the Mashriq at 73.6%. The United Nations published an Arab human development report in 2002, 2003 and 2004. These reports, written by researchers from the Arab world, address some sensitive issues in the development of Arab countries: women empowerment, availability of education and information among others. Gender equality and women's rights Women in the Arab world are still denied equality of opportunity, although their disenfranchisement is a critical factor crippling the Arab nations' quest to return to the first rank of global leaders in commerce, learning and culture, according to a United Nations-sponsored report in 2008.[36] Child marriages According to the United Nations, 14% of Arab girls are married by the age of 18.[37] Violence Rapists are often treated leniently or acquitted in the Arab region if they marry their victims. 37% of Arab women experienced violence in their lifetime but the numbers may be higher according to indicators. In some countries, the share of women experiencing violence and abuse by intimate partner reaches 70%.[37] Largest cities in the Arab world Main article: List of largest cities in the Arab world Table of largest cities in the Arab world by official city propers:[38] Rank Country City Population Founding date Image 1 Egypt Cairo 16,225,000 969 AD 2 Iraq Baghdad 6,960,000 762 AD 3 Saudi Arabia Riyadh 6,030,000 100–200 AD 4 Sudan Khartoum 5,345,000 1821 AD 5 Jordan Amman 4,995,000 7250 BC 6 Egypt Alexandria 4,870,000 331 BC 7 Kuwait Kuwait City 4,660,000 1613 AD 8 Morocco Casablanca 4,370,000 768 AD 9 Saudi Arabia Jeddah 3,875,000 600 BC 10 United Arab Emirates Dubai 3,805,000 1833 AD[39] History Main article: History of the Arabs Early history Further information: Arabization The Great Mosque of Kairouan (also called the Mosque of Uqba) was founded in 670 by the Arab general and conqueror Uqba ibn Nafi.[40] The Great Mosque of Kairouan is located in the historic city of Kairouan in Tunisia. The Arabs historically originate as a Central Semitic group in southern Levant and northern Arabian peninsula.[41] Arab tribes and federations such as Nabataeans, Tanukhids, Salihids, Ghassanids, and numerous other groups were prevalent in southern Levant (Syrian Desert) and northern Arabia. Their expansion beyond Arabia and the Syrian desert is due to the Muslim conquests of the 7th and 8th centuries. Iraq was conquered in 633, Levant (modern Syria, Israel, Palestine, Jordan and Lebanon ) between 636 and 640 CE. Egypt was conquered in 639, and gradually Arabized during the medieval period. A distinctively Egyptian Arabic language emerged by the 16th century. The Maghreb was also conquered in the 7th century, and gradually Arabized under the Fatimids. Islam was brought to Sudan from Egypt during the 8th to 11th centuries. The culture of Sudan today depends on the tribe, some have a pure Nubian, Beja, or Arabic culture and some have a mixture of Arab and Nubian elements.[42] Ottoman and colonial rule The Arab Abbasid Caliphate fell to the Mongol invasions in the 13th century. Egypt, the Levant and Hejaz also came under the Turkish Mamluk Sultanate. By 1570, the Turkish Ottoman Empire controlled most of the Arab world. However, Morocco remained under the rule of the Zenata Wattasid dynasty, which was succeeded by the Saadi dynasty in the 16th to 17th centuries. The Ajuran Sultanate also held sway in the southern part of the Horn region. The sentiment of Arab nationalism arose in the second half of the 19th century along with other nationalisms within the declining Ottoman Empire. When the Ottoman Empire collapsed as a result of World War I, much of the Arab world came to be controlled by the European colonial empires: Mandatory Palestine, Mandatory Iraq, British protectorate of Egypt, French protectorate of Morocco, Italian Libya, French Tunisia, French Algeria, French Mandate of Syria and Lebanon and the so-called Trucial States, a British protectorate formed by the sheikhdoms on the former ""Pirate Coast"". These Arab states only gained their independence during or after World War II: the Republic of Lebanon in 1943, the Syrian Arab Republic and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in 1946, the Kingdom of Libya in 1951, the Kingdom of Egypt in 1952, the Kingdom of Morocco and Tunisia in 1956, the Republic of Iraq in 1958, the Somali Republic in 1960, Algeria in 1962, and the United Arab Emirates in 1971. By contrast, Saudi Arabia had fragmented with the fall of the Ottoman Empire, and was unified under Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia by 1932. The Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen also seceded directly from the Ottoman Empire in 1918. Oman, apart from brief intermittent Persian and Portuguese rule, has been self-governing since the 8th century. Rise of Arab nationalism Further information: Islam and modernity and Arab Cold War The Arab League was formed in 1945 to represent the interests of the Arabs, and especially to pursue the political unification of the Arab world, a project known as Pan-Arabism.[12][13] There were some short-lived attempts at such unification in the mid-20th century, notably the United Arab Republic of 1958 to 1961. The Arab League's main goal is to unify politically the Arab populations so defined. Its permanent headquarters are located in Cairo. However, it was moved temporarily to Tunis during the 1980s, after Egypt was expelled for signing the Camp David Accords (1978). Pan-Arabism has mostly been abandoned as an ideology since the 1980s, and was replaced by Pan-Islamism on one hand, and individual nationalisms on the other. Modern conflicts Main article: List of modern conflicts in the Middle East Unification of Saudi Arabia The unification of Saudi Arabia was a 30-year-long military and political campaign, by which the various tribes, sheikhdoms, and emirates of most of the Arabian Peninsula were conquered by the House of Saud, or Al Saud, between 1902 and 1932, when the modern-day Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was proclaimed. Carried out under the charismatic Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud, this process created what is sometimes referred to as the Third Saudi State, to differentiate it from the first and second states that existed under the Al Saud clan. The Al-Saud had been in exile in Ottoman Iraq since 1893 following the disintegration of the Second Saudi State and the rise of Jebel Shammar under the Al Rashid clan. In 1902, Ibn Saud recaptured Riyadh, the Al Saud dynasty's former capital. He went on to subdue the rest of Nejd, Al-Hasa, Jebel Shammar, Asir, and Hejaz (location of the Muslim holy cities of Mecca and Medina) between 1913 and 1926. The resultant polity was named the Kingdom of Nejd and Hejaz from 1927 until it was further consolidated with Al-Hasa and Qatif into the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932. Arab–Israeli conflict Further information: Arab–Israeli conflict The establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 has given rise to the Arab–Israeli conflict, one of the major unresolved geopolitical conflicts. The Arab states in changing alliances were involved in a number of wars with Israel and its western allies between 1948 and 1973, including the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the 1956 Suez Crisis, the Six-Day War of 1967, and the Yom Kippur War of 1973. An Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty was signed in 1979. Iraq–Iran War Main article: Iran–Iraq War The Iran–Iraq War (also known as the First Gulf War and by various other names) was an armed conflict between the armed forces of Iraq and Iran, lasting from September 1980 to August 1988, making it the second longest conventional war of the 20th century. It was initially referred to in English as the ""Gulf War"" prior to the ""Gulf War"" of 1990. The war began when Iraq invaded Iran, launching a simultaneous invasion by air and land into Iranian territory on 22 September 1980 following a long history of border disputes, and fears of Shia Islam insurgency among Iraq's long-suppressed Shia majority influenced by the Iranian Revolution. Iraq was also aiming to replace Iran as the dominant Persian Gulf state. Although Iraq hoped to take advantage of the revolutionary chaos in Iran (see Iranian Revolution, 1979) and attacked without formal warning, they made only limited progress into Iran and were quickly repelled by the Iranians who regained virtually all lost territory by June 1982. For the next six years, Iran was on the offensive. Lebanese Civil War Main article: Lebanese Civil War The Lebanese Civil War was a multifaceted civil war in Lebanon, lasting from 1975 to 1990 and resulting in an estimated 120,000 fatalities. Another one million people (a quarter of the population) were wounded,[citation needed] and today approximately 76,000 people remain displaced within Lebanon. There was also a mass exodus of almost one million people from Lebanon. Western Sahara conflict Main article: Western Sahara conflict The Western Sahara War was an armed struggle between the Sahrawi Polisario Front and Morocco between 1975 and 1991, being the most significant phase of the Western Sahara conflict. The conflict erupted after the withdrawal of Spain from the Spanish Sahara in accordance with the Madrid Accords, by which it transferred administrative control of the territory to Morocco and Mauritania, but not the sovereignty. In 1975, Moroccan government organized the Green March of some 350,000 Moroccan citizens, escorted by around 20,000 troops, who entered Western Sahara, trying to establish Moroccan presence. While at first met with just minor resistance by the Polisario, Morocco later engaged a long period of guerilla warfare with the Sahrawi nationalists. During the late 1970s, the Polisario Front, desiring to establish an independent state in the territory, successively fought both Mauritania and Morocco. In 1979, Mauritania withdrew from the conflict after signing a peace treaty with the Polisario. The war continued in low intensity throughout the 1980s, though Morocco made several attempts to take the upper hand in 1989–1991. A cease-fire agreement was finally reached between the Polisario Front and Morocco in September 1991. North Yemen Civil War Main article: North Yemen Civil War The North Yemen Civil War was fought in North Yemen between royalists of the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen and factions of the Yemen Arab Republic from 1962 to 1970. The war began with a coup d'état carried out by the republican leader, Abdullah as-Sallal, which dethroned the newly crowned Imam al-Badr and declared Yemen a republic under his presidency. The Imam escaped to the Saudi Arabian border and rallied popular support. Somali Civil War Main article: Somali Civil War The Somali Civil War is an ongoing civil war taking place in Somalia. It began in 1991, when a coalition of clan-based armed opposition groups ousted the nation's long-standing military government. Various factions began competing for influence in the power vacuum that followed, which precipitated an aborted UN peacekeeping attempt in the mid-1990s. A period of decentralization ensued, characterized by a return to customary and religious law in many areas as well as the establishment of autonomous regional governments in the northern part of the country. The early 2000s saw the creation of fledgling interim federal administrations, culminating in the establishment of the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) in 2004. In 2006, the TFG, assisted by Ethiopian troops, assumed control of most of the nation's southern conflict zones from the newly formed Islamic Courts Union (ICU). The ICU subsequently splintered into more radical groups, notably Al-Shabaab, which have since been fighting the Somali government and its AMISOM allies for control of the region. In 2011, a coordinated military operation between the Somali military and multinational forces began, which is believed to represent one of the final stages in the war's Islamist insurgency.[43] Arab Spring Main articles: Arab Spring, Libyan Civil War, and Syrian Civil War The popular protests throughout the Arab world of late 2010 to the present have been directed against authoritarian leadership and associated political corruption, paired with demands for more democratic rights. The two most violent and prolonged conflicts in the aftermath of the Arab Spring are the Libyan Civil War and Syrian Civil War. Petroleum While the Arab world had been of limited interest to the European colonial powers, the British Empire being mostly interested in the Suez Canal as a route to British India, the economic and geopolitical situation changed dramatically after the discovery of large petroleum deposits in the 1930s, coupled with the vastly increased demand for petroleum in the west as a result of the Second Industrial Revolution. The Persian Gulf is particularly well-endowed with this strategic raw material: five Persian Gulf states, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the UAE, Kuwait, and Qatar, are among the top ten petroleum or gas exporters worldwide. In Africa, Algeria (10th world) and Libya are important gas exporters. In addition Bahrain, Egypt, Tunisia, and Sudan all have smaller but significant reserves. Where present, these have had significant effects on regional politics, often enabling rentier states, leading to economic disparities between oil-rich and oil-poor countries, and, particularly in the more sparsely populated states of the Persian Gulf and Libya, triggering extensive labor immigration. It is believed that the Arab world holds approximately 46% of the world's total proven oil reserves and a quarter of the world's natural-gas reserves.[44] Islamism and Pan-Islamism were on the rise during the 1980s. The Hezbollah, a militant Islamic party in Lebanon, was founded in 1982. Islamic terrorism became a problem in the Arab world in the 1970s to 1980s. While the Muslim Brotherhood had been active in Egypt since 1928, their militant actions were limited to assassination attempts on political leaders. Recent history Today, Arab states are characterized by their autocratic rulers and lack of democratic control. The 2016 Democracy Index classifies Lebanon, Iraq and Palestine as ""hybrid regimes"", Tunisia as a ""flawed democracy"" and all other Arab states as ""authoritarian regimes"". Similarly, the 2011 Freedom House report classifies the Comoros and Mauritania as ""electoral democracies"",[45] Lebanon, Kuwait and Morocco as ""partly free"", and all other Arab states as ""not free"". The invasion of Kuwait by Iraq forces, led to the 1990–91 Persian Gulf War. Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia joined a multinational coalition that opposed Iraq. Displays of support for Iraq by Jordan and Palestine resulted in strained relations between many of the Arab states. After the war, a so-called ""Damascus Declaration"" formalized an alliance for future joint Arab defensive actions between Egypt, Syria, and the GCC states.[46] A chain of events leading to the destabilization of the authoritarian regimes established during the 1950s throughout the Arab world became apparent during the early years of the 21st century. The 2003 invasion of Iraq led to the collapse of the Baathist regime and ultimate execution of Saddam Hussein. A growing class of young, educated, secular citizens with access to modern media such as Al Jazeera (since 1996) and communicating via the internet began to form a third force besides the classical dichotomy of Pan-Arabism vs. Pan-Islamism that had dominated the second half of the 20th century. In Syria, the Damascus Spring of 2000 to 2001 heralded the possibility of democratic change, but the Baathist regime managed to suppress the movement. In 2003, the Egyptian Movement for Change, popularly known as Kefaya, was launched to oppose the Mubarak regime and to establish democratic reforms and greater civil liberties in Egypt. States and territories For the states and territories constituting the Arab world, see definition above. Forms of government Different forms of government are represented in the Arab World: Some of the countries are monarchies: Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The other Arab countries are all republics. With the exception of Lebanon, Tunisia, Palestine, and recently Mauritania, democratic elections throughout the Arab World are generally viewed as compromised, due to outright vote rigging, intimidation of opposition parties, and severe restraints on civil liberties and political dissent. After World War II, Pan-Arabism sought to unite all Arabic-speaking countries into one political entity. Only Syria, Iraq, Egypt, Sudan, Tunisia, Libya and North Yemen considered the short-lived unification of the United Arab Republic. Historical divisions, competing local nationalisms, and geographical sprawl were major reasons for the failure of Pan-Arabism. Arab Nationalism was another strong force in the region which peaked during the mid-20th century and was professed by many leaders in Egypt, Algeria, Libya, Syria, and Iraq. Arab Nationalist leaders of this period included Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt, Ahmed Ben Bella of Algeria, Michel Aflaq, Salah al-Din al-Bitar, Zaki al-Arsuzi, Constantin Zureiq and Shukri al-Kuwatli of Syria, Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr of Iraq, Habib Bourguiba of Tunisia, Mehdi Ben Barka of Morocco, and Shakib Arslan of Lebanon. Later and current Arab Nationalist leaders include Muammar al-Gaddafi of Libya, Hafez al-Assad and Bashar al-Assad of Syria. The diverse Arab states generally maintained close ties but distinct national identities developed and strengthened with the social, historical and political realities of the past 60 years. This has made the idea of a pan-Arab nation-state increasingly less feasible and likely. Additionally, an upsurge in political Islam has since led to a greater emphasis on pan-Islamic rather than pan-Arab identity amongst some Arab Muslims. Arab nationalists who once opposed Islamic movements as a threat to their power, now deal with them differently for reasons of political reality.[47] Modern boundaries Many of the modern borders of the Arab World were drawn by European imperial powers during the 19th and early 20th century. However, some of the larger states (in particular Egypt and Syria) have historically maintained geographically definable boundaries, on which some of the modern states are roughly based. The 14th-century Egyptian historian Al-Maqrizi, for instance, defines Egypt's boundaries as extending from the Mediterranean in the north to lower Nubia in the south; and between the Red Sea in the east and the oases of the Western/Libyan desert. The modern borders of Egypt, therefore, are not a creation of European powers, and are at least in part based on historically definable entities which are in turn based on certain cultural and ethnic identifications. At other times, kings, emirs or sheikhs were placed as semi-autonomous rulers over the newly created nation states, usually chosen by the same imperial powers that for some drew the new borders, for services rendered to European powers like the British Empire, e.g. Sherif Hussein ibn Ali. Many African states did not attain independence until the 1960s from France after bloody insurgencies for their freedom. These struggles were settled by the imperial powers approving the form of independence given, so as a consequence almost all of these borders have remained. Some of these borders were agreed upon without consultation of those individuals that had served the colonial interests of Britain or France. One such agreement solely between Britain and France (to the exclusion of Sherif Hussein ibn Ali), signed in total secrecy until Lenin released the full text, was the Sykes-Picot Agreement. Another influential document written without the consensus of the local population was the Balfour Declaration. As former director of the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad, Efraim Halevy, now a director at the Hebrew University said, The borders, which if you look on the maps of the middle-east are very straight lines, were drawn by British and French draftsmen who sat with maps and drew the lines of the frontiers with rulers. If the ruler for some reason or other moved on the map, because of some person's hand shaking, then the frontier moved (with the hand).[48] He went on to give an example, There was a famous story about a British consul, a lady named Gertrude Bell who drew the map between Iraq and Jordan, using transparent paper. She turned to talk to somebody and as she was turning the paper moved and the ruler moved and that added considerable territory to the (new) Jordanians.[48] Historian Jim Crow, of Newcastle University, has said: Without that imperial carve-up, Iraq would not be in the state it is in today...Gertrude Bell was one of two or three Britons who were instrumental in the creation of the Arab states in the Middle East that were favourable to Britain.[49] Modern economies As of 2006, the Arab world accounts for two-fifths of the gross domestic product and three-fifths of the trade of the wider Muslim world.[citation needed] The Arab states are mostly, although not exclusively, developing economies and derive their export revenues from oil and gas, or the sale of other raw materials. Recent years have seen significant economic growth in the Arab World, due largely to an increase in oil and gas prices, which tripled between 2001 and 2006, but also due to efforts by some states to diversify their economic base. Industrial production has risen, for example the amount of steel produced between 2004 and 2005 rose from 8.4 to 19 million tonnes. (Source: Opening speech of Mahmoud Khoudri, Algeria's Industry Minister, at the 37th General Assembly of the Iron & Steel Arab Union, Algiers, May 2006). However even 19 million tons pa still only represents 1.7% of global steel production, and remains inferior to the production of countries like Brazil.[50] The main economic organisations in the Arab World are the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), comprising the states in the Persian Gulf, and the Union of the Arab Maghreb (UMA), made up of North African States. The GCC has achieved some success in financial and monetary terms, including plans to establish a common currency in the Persian Gulf region. Since its foundation in 1989, the UMA's most significant accomplishment has been the establishment of a 7000 km highway crossing North Africa from Mauritania to Libya's border with Egypt. The central stretch of the highway, expected to be completed in 2010, will cross Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. In recent years a new term has been coined to define a greater economic region: the MENA region (standing for ""Middle East and North Africa"") is becoming increasingly popular, especially with support from the current US administration. As of August 2009 it was reported that Saudi Arabia is the strongest Arab economy according to World Bank.[51] Saudi Arabia remains the top Arab economy in terms of total GDP. It is Asia's eleventh largest economy, followed by Egypt and Algeria, which were also the second and third largest economies in Africa (after South Africa), in 2006. In terms of GDP per capita, Qatar is the richest developing country in the world.[52] The total GDP of all Arab countries in 1999 was US$531.2 billion.[53] By grouping all the latest GDP figures, the total Arab world GDP is estimated to be worth at least $2.8 trillion in 2011.[54] This is only smaller than the GDP of US, China, Japan and Germany. Geography Main article: Geography of the Arab world The Arab World stretches across more than 13,000,000 square kilometres (5,000,000 sq mi) of North Africa and the part of North-East Africa and South-West Asia. The eastern part of the Arab world is called the Mashriq. Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Libya and Mauritania are the Maghreb or Maghrib. The Maghreb (Western Arab world) The term ""Arab"" often connotes the Arabian Peninsula, but the larger (and more populous) part of the Arab World is North Africa. Its eight million square kilometers include two of the largest countries of the African continent, Algeria (2.4 million km2) in the center of the region and Sudan (1.9 million km2) in the southeast. Algeria is about three-quarters the size of India, or about one-and-a-half times the size of Alaska, the largest state in the United States. The largest country in the Arab Western Asia is Saudi Arabia (2 million km2). At the other extreme, the smallest autonomous mainland Arab country is Lebanon (10,452 km2), and the smallest island Arab country is Bahrain (665 km2). Notably, every Arab country borders a sea or ocean, with the exception of the Arab region of northern Chad, which is completely landlocked. Iraq is actually nearly landlocked, as it has only a very narrow access to the Persian Gulf. Historical boundaries The political borders of the Arab world have wandered, leaving Arab minorities in non-Arab countries of the Sahel and the Horn of Africa as well as in the Middle Eastern countries of Cyprus, Turkey and Iran, and also leaving non-Arab minorities in Arab countries. However, the basic geography of sea, desert and mountain provides the enduring natural boundaries for this region. Abbasid caliphate (750 – 1258 CE) The Arab world straddles two continents, Africa and Asia. It is mainly oriented along an east–west axis. Arab Africa Arab Africa comprises the entire northern third of the continent. It is surrounded by water on three sides (west, north, and east) and desert or desert scrubland on the fourth (south). In the west, it is bounded by the shores of the Atlantic Ocean. From northeast to southwest, Morocco, Western Sahara (mostly unilaterally annexed by Morocco), and Mauritania make up the roughly 2,000 kilometers of Arab Atlantic coastline. The southwestern sweep of the coast is gentle but substantial, such that Mauritania's capital, Nouakchott (18°N, 16°W), is far enough west to share longitude with Iceland (13–22°W). Nouakchott is the westernmost capital of the Arab World and the third-westernmost in Africa, and sits on the Atlantic fringe of the southwestern Sahara. Next south along the coast from Mauritania is Senegal, whose abrupt border belies the gradient in culture from Arab to indigenous African that historically characterizes this part of West Africa. Arab Africa's boundary to the north is again a continental boundary, the Mediterranean Sea. This boundary begins in the west with the narrow Strait of Gibraltar, the thirteen kilometer wide channel that connects the Mediterranean with the Atlantic to the west, and separates Morocco from Spain to the north. East along the coast from Morocco are Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya, followed by Egypt, which forms the region's (and the continent's) northeastern corner. The coast turns briefly but sharply south at Tunisia, slopes more gently southeastward through the Libyan capital of Tripoli, and bumps north through Libya's second city, Benghazi, before turning straight east again through Egypt's second city, Alexandria, at the mouth of the Nile. Along with the spine of Italy to its north, Tunisia thus marks the junction of western and eastern Mediterranean, and a cultural transition as well: west of Egypt begins the region of the Arab World known as the Maghreb include (Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco and Mauritania). Historically the 4,000-kilometer Mediterranean boundary has fluttered. Population centers north of it in Europe have invited contact and Arab exploration—mostly friendly, though sometimes not. Islands and peninsulas near the Arab coast have changed hands. The islands of Sicily and Malta lie just a hundred kilometers east of the Tunisian city of Carthage, which has been a point of contact with Europe since its founding in the first millennium BCE; both Sicily and Malta at times have been part of the Arab World. Just across the Strait of Gibraltar from Morocco, regions of the Iberian peninsula were part of the Arab World throughout the Middle Ages, extending the northern boundary at times to the foothills of the Pyrenees and leaving a substantial mark on local and wider European and Western culture. The northern boundary of the African Arab world has also fluttered briefly in the other direction, first through the Crusades and later through the imperial involvement of France, Britain, Spain, and Italy. Another visitor from northern shores, Turkey, controlled the east of the region for centuries, though not as a colonizer. Spain still maintains two small enclaves, Ceuta and Melilla (called ""Morocco Espanol""), along the otherwise Moroccan coast. Overall this wave has ebbed, though like the Arab expansion north it has left its mark. The proximity of North Africa to Europe has always encouraged interaction, and this continues with Arab immigration to Europe and European interest in the Arab countries today. However, population centers and the physical fact of the sea keeps this boundary of the Arab World settled on the Mediterranean coastline. To the east, the Red Sea defines the boundary between Africa and Asia, and thus also between Arab Africa and Arab Western Asia. This sea is a long and narrow waterway with a northwest tilt, stretching 2,300 kilometers from Egypt's Sinai peninsula southeast to the Bab-el-Mandeb strait between Djibouti in Africa and Yemen in Arabia but on average just 150 kilometers wide. Though the sea is navigable along its length, historically much contact between Arab Africa and Arab Western Asia has been either overland across the Sinai or by sea across the Mediterranean or the narrow Bab al Mendeb strait. From northwest to southeast, Egypt, Sudan, and Eritrea form the African coastline, with Djibouti marking Bab al Mendeb's African shore. Southeast along the coast from Djibouti is Somalia, but the Somali coast soon makes a 90-degree turn and heads northeast, mirroring a bend in the coast of Yemen across the water to the north and defining the south coast of the Gulf of Aden. The Somali coast then takes a hairpin turn back southwest to complete the horn of Africa. For six months of the year the monsoon winds blow from up equatorial Somalia, past Arabia and over the small Yemeni archipelago of Socotra, to rain on India; they then switch directions and blow back. Hence the east- and especially southeast-coast boundary of Arab Africa has historically been a gateway for maritime trade and cultural exchange with both East Africa and the subcontinent. The trade winds also help explain the presence of the Comoros islands, an Arab-African country, off the coast of Mozambique, near Madagascar in the Indian Ocean, the southernmost part of the Arab World. The southern boundary of Arab North Africa is the strip of scrubland known as the Sahel that crosses the continent south of the Sahara. Arab Western Asia The Western Asian Arab region comprises the Arabian Peninsula, most of the Levant (excluding Cyprus and Israel), most of Mesopotamia (excluding parts of Turkey and Iran) and the Persian Gulf region. The peninsula is roughly a tilted rectangle that leans back against the slope of northeast Africa, the long axis pointing toward Turkey and Europe.

While it maintains its character as a non-governmental organization, AFED admits, in the capacity of observers, national, regional and international bodies working in the fields of environment and sustainable development. It has been endorsed by the League of Arab States (LAS) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). AFED was officially proclaimed in Beirut on 17 June 2006, at the conclusion of a regional conference on Public Opinion and the Environment, organized by Al-Bia Wal-Tanmia (Environment & Development magazine). The initiative, which started in 2001 by Al-Bia Wal-Tanmia publisher Najib Saab as an informal gathering of the magazine’s region-wide readers, was established as a regional organization on the occasion of its tenth anniversary. AFED has subsequently earned the status of international non-governmental organization, with the associated amenities for its secretariat based in Beirut. Al-Bia Wal-Tanmia magazine became an organ of AFED as of January 2013, after Saab turned it over to the pan-Arab organization.

During six years, it has become a major dynamic player in the environmental arena. AFED works towards bringing together all parties concerned with environment and development in the Arab world to discuss regional and national issues related to the environment, in view of local and global changes, emphasizing the pivotal role of civil society and the private sector. It groups regional environmental organizations and experts with leading academic institutions, media and the business community, on common debate grounds to further the cause of environment and sustainable development. The Forum, which cooperates with regional and international institutions, aims at spreading environmental awareness through promoting sensible information and education programmes, as well as supporting civil society organizations active in the environmental sector. AFED aims at encouraging Arab societies to protect the environment and use natural resources in a sensible manner resulting in sustainable development. An independent periodic report on the State of Arab Environment (SAE) is yearly produced by AFED, to be presented to the General Assembly of the Forum. The high-level annual forum is designed to attract participants from the private and public sectors, academia, experts, media and civil society. Goals[edit] Bringing together those concerned about environment and development in the Arab countries, to discuss problems in the light of changing regional and global conditions, and help addressing challenges, through appropriate policies. Motivating Arab societies to protect the environment, rationally utilize natural resources, and realize sustainable development goals, through positive interaction among policy makers, businessmen, academia, civil society, media, and other stakeholders. Propagating environmental awareness, by supporting environmental education and information and providing capacity building for civil society organizations. Course of action[edit] AFED works to achieve its goals through the following course: Issuing a periodical report on the state of the environment and natural resources in the Arab world, with an emphasis on evaluating the progress towards the realization of sustainable development targets, as well as examining Arab contribution to global environmental endeavors. Convening regularly to discuss regional reports on environmental matters and to investigate their impact on the process of sustainable development in the Arab world, with subsidiary meetings to discuss issues of special concern or specific sub-regional problems. Working with the business community in the Arab world to develop a Corporate Environmental Responsibility Programme, adopt sustainable practices and move towards cleaner production technologies. Encouraging scientific research on current and emerging environmental issues in the Arab world. Cooperating with the media and the advertising sectors to promote environmental awareness through various tools. Working with educational institutions, universities, and research centres towards the development of environmental education programmes at all levels, both for promoting constructive environmental behavior and attitudes, and building up capacities in the domains of environmental sciences and management. Supporting networking of NGO’s active in the domain of environment and development and coordinating joint programmes among them. Governance[edit] The Arab Forum for Environment and Development is governed by a Board of Trustees, representing environmental experts alongside business, media, and civil society leaders. The Board of Trustees elects an Executive Committee that includes a Chairman, Vice Chairman, Secretary General, Treasurer and members. It also appoints honorary members and an external auditor. It meets annually to decide on AFED policies, programs, and budget. The Executive Committee oversees the overall management of AFED, including programs and finance, and meets at least twice a year. Responsibility for the daily management of AFED lies with the Secretary General, assisted by a core secretariat. Funding[edit] AFED funds come from: Membership fees Contributions to AFED Endowment Sponsorship by corporate partners and organizations Income from activities and services As a not-for-profit organization, any surplus capital is invested in new initiatives or existing programs. Membership[edit] Prospective members and observers must submit their applications to AFED Executive Committee, which will consider each case according to the set criteria. Membership continues as long as a member meets the criteria and pays the annual dues. AFED membership is open to all those committed to the goals of sustainable development in Arab countries. The main requirement is acceptance and adoption of AFED mission statement, and commitment to help achieve AFED goals. AFED provides a platform to address and reach a wider audience, in public and private sectors, while allowing networking, exchange of expertise, and exposure to similar initiatives around the world. Working together in such a unique partnership allows members to advance their knowledge of emerging trends and business strategies, while serving a good social and environmental cause. In turn, these efforts will contribute to empowering Arab countries and societies to better tackle the challenges of an increasingly complex world, and embrace the transition to a green economy, that will lead to recession-proof growth, economic vitality, and welfare of Arab societies. AFED membership is institutional In five years, 110 institutional members joined AFED, including: 40 corporate members, 24 NGOs including one political Green party, 12 universities and research centers, 24 media organizations, and 10 government agencies as observers. Membership categories[edit] Corporate[edit] Businesses active in the Arab region, which are willing to advocate, promote, and adopt policies of sustainable development. Media[edit] Broadcast and print media which commit to promoting public awareness of environmental issues and furthering of the AFED mission NGOs[edit] Representing grassroots leadership in mobilizing the public to support environmental causes, as well as advising and pressuring the public sector on these issues. Academic and research institutions[edit] Offering educational and research programs related to various aspects of environment and sustainable development. Observers[edit] National, regional, and international governmental and inter-governmental bodies, whose mandates cover environment and sustainable development issues. Annual reports[edit] AFED released seven reports covering environmental issues in the Arab world: AFED Report 2008 “Arab Environment 1: Future Challenges” AFED Report 2009 “Arab Environment 2: Climate Change, Impact of Climate Change on Arab Countries” AFED Report 2010 “Arab Environment 3: Water, Sustainable Management of a Scarce Resource” AFED Report 2011 “Arab Environment 4: Green Economy, Sustainable Transition in a Changing Arab World” AFED Report 2012 “Arab Environment 5: Survival Options, Ecological Footprint of Arab Countries” AFED Report 2013 “Arab Environment 6: Sustainable Energy – Prospects, Challenges, Opportunities” AFED Report 2014 “Arab Environment 7: Food Security” AFED Report 2015 ""Arab Environment 8: Sustainable Consumption"" AFED Report 2016 ""Arab Environment 9: sustainable Development in a Changing Arab Climate"" AFED Report 2017 ""Arab Environment 10: Arab Environment in 10 Years"" AFED Report 2018 ""Arab Environment 11: Financing Sustainable Development in Arab Countries"" AFED’s expert-written, policy oriented annual reports have become the main reference on the state of Arab environment. Findings and recommendations have been endorsed by national and regional bodies. Alongside the original Arabic and English editions, the reports were translated into other languages, including Japanese and Spanish. AFED’s reports can be downloaded from AFED website. Annual conventions[edit] The most recent AFED convention, held in Sharjah, UAE, in October 2013, brought together over 600 delegates from the public and private sectors, scientists, civil society and media, who engaged in an open debate on Sustainable Energy in the Arab region. The 2012 convention, in Beirut, tackled Survival Options and Ecological Footprint. The 2011 convention discussed Green Economy, while the 2010 convention debated AFED’s report Water: Sustainable Management of a Scarce Resource. The 2009 convention discussed the impact of climate change on Arab countries. The first 2008 convention in Bahrain tackled future environmental challenges. All AFED conventions issue recommendations for action, which are discussed with governments and other stakeholders, and in many cases have contributed to changes in national policies. AFED activities[edit] AFED Mag[edit] AFED and ‘’Al-Bia Wal-Tanmia’’ (Environment and Development magazine) launched, in March 2013, the first comprehensive online environmental portal in Arabic, making over 35,000 pages of references freely available to readers and researchers. The domain includes a full archive of the magazine contents during the past 18 years. The website is updated daily with news, information and commentaries. The domain’s name www.afedmag.com (AFED magazine) reflects a new epoch of the magazine, which became an organ of AFED as of January 2013, after its publisher Najib Saab turned it over to the pan-Arab organization. AFED documentaries[edit] AFED produced six documentaries. The latest, “Powering Arab Future”, summarized AFED report on Sustainable Energy, and was shown during ESCWA Renewable Energy Conference in Morocco, 2013. “That They May Have Life” , discussed Ecological Footprint and the right of future generations to natural resources. “Green Change” was launched at AFED’s 2011 annual convention. A documentary on water scarcity in the Arab world, entitled “The Last Drop”, was screened in its third annual conference in November 2010, and broadcast in Cancun Summit and on several Arab televisions networks. Its 2009 “Wet and Dry” documentary on climate change was broadcast more than 450 times on national and regional television networks. The earlier “Testimony of an Old Man” in 2008 was broadcast 600 times, and over 6000 DVDs were distributed to schools, civil society organizations, business executives, and governments. AFED continues to support the capacity building initiatives of its member NGOs, as well as its awareness campaigns, school competitions, and training of journalists. Environmental education[edit] AFED has developed a comprehensive environmental education program, supported by a wide-ranging handbook. It provides all material needed to initiate environment activities at schools and incorporate environment in the curricula. Each of the 2 topics is supported by graphics, posters, documentaries, songs and plays, all available online. AFED program includes developing curricula at the national levels and teacher training workshops. Arab Green Economy Initiative[edit] In May 2009, AFED launched the Arab Green Economy Initiative (AGEI), designed to facilitate the transition of governments and businesses to more environment-friendly practices. The AGEI covers: Public Policy Recommendations, Economics of Eco-system Investing, Corporate Environmental Responsibility (CER), New Business Workshops, Sustainability Reporting, and Web-based Consumer Education. AFED carried out workshops for stakeholders in seven Arab countries to kick-start the AGEI program and select priorities. The 2011 AFED report Green Economy: Sustainable Transition in a Changing Arab World was one component of the initiative. Other components are 2 handbooks which AFED produced and are in use across the region, on: Water Efficiency, which is a practical guide, providing tips on achieving better sensible use of water in buildings. Energy Efficiency, which is designed to help better environmental housekeeping in office buildings. In January 2012, the UAE announced its national initiative «Green Economy for Sustainable Development”. Corporate Environmental Responsibility[edit] AFED launched its Corporate Environmental Responsibility (CER) initiative in Abu Dhabi, on 29 November 2007, at the conclusion of the Arab CER Summit, organized by AFED and Environment Agency Abu Dhabi (EAD). Over 120 CEOs, representing major business sectors from across the Arab world, have committed to advance the principles of environmental responsibility and cleaner production, and set a target to reduce energy and water consumption by 20% in their operations by 2012. The CER program works with business enterprises to institutionalize environmental thinking and action in corporate decision making. It also aims at developing a comprehensible roadmap for navigating a transition to environmental responsibility, by integrating environmental goals more effectively into core business operations and strategy. Cooperation with organizations[edit] AFED has contributed to over 200 regional and international meetings, reports and programs. Its reports, recommendations and initiatives have been discussed and considered at high-level regional and international meetings, including UNEP, the Council of Arab Ministers Responsible for Environment (CAMRE), the World Bank, ESCWA and ILO. AFED gained observer status with UNFCCC, UNEP and LAS. Quotations[edit] Dr. Andrew Steer President, World Resources Institute (WRI) “I have seen many environmental organizations in my time and I think the combination that AFED brings is absolutely best practice. You bring a sharp pencil of analysis, together with the right mix of people: private sector, government, academic, civil society, financiers; because we need all hands on deck if we are going to solve the problem. This part of the world has given to all of us two extraordinary leaders in environment. One is Mustafa Kamal Tolba who was the executive director of UNEP and who has been a precursor in these events; and the other one is, Mohamed El-Ashry, who led GEF, the Global Environmental Facility, and who has been a leader in every thought process dealing with the transition to low carbon. It is not just a coincidence that both are AFED veterans.” Kerstin Fritzsche Center for Near and Middle Eastern Studies (CNMS), The Philipp University of Marburg, Germany “AFED reports have been a valuable source of information and inspiration to my students when learning about the Arab region” José María Figueres Former President of Costa Rica and Chairman of the Carbon War Room “The report which has been put out by AFED constitutes a very good footprint for action. And action it is what we are convened to undertake in the world of today."" Joining AFED[edit] Interested in joining regional efforts to save the environment in the Arab world?

Started by a group of renowned scientists and environmentalists, it seeks to find, promote and scale-up solutions for some of the most pressing environment–development challenges. It also endeavours to make environmental protection a peoples’ movement by informing and engaging the citizenry in important issues and programs. About iForest Our Initiatives Our initiatives and programmes address the fundamental problems of environment and development. They are designed to reflect the cross-sectoral nature of the issues and the integrated approach required for sustainable solutions. Energy & Climate Change The integrated approach is focussed on solutions for ensuring affordable and green energy, and a just transition away from the fossil-fuel economy. Improving energy efficiency and promoting innovative low-energy technologies is also a key focus of our work. Our research and engagement cuts across local, national as well as international levels to propose ideas and push for actions that are practical and collective. Know More Pollution & Waste Management Sustainable consumption and production lie at the heart of pollution and waste management. Our programmes focus on managing waste and pollution through better governance, improved capacity and smart and affordable technology. We also strongly focus on citizens’ awareness and engagement on lifestyle changes, as we believe change should begin at home. Know More Natural Resource Management​ India’s natural resources, if managed sustainably, have tremendous potential to strengthen the country’s economic base, reduce distress migration, protect ecologically sensitive areas, as well as deal with overarching issues of land degradation, water scarcity and climate change. We encourage a people-centric approach to achieve this building on the strength of our laws and technology to reach out to the grassroots. Know More Green Economy Our green economy initiative focuses on engaging businesses, especially the financial sector, to mainstream environmental protection and climate change concerns in their decision-making processes. We undertake independent research on the environment and social performance of companies and provide data and information to understand the financial risks posed by environmental threats, including climate change. We also work on circular economy and promote green growth. Know More Citizen's Corner Citizens have a key role in catalysing change, both at the local and the global level. We seek to empower citizens with data, knowledge and tools to enable them to demand action on environmental issues, as well as to make informed lifestyle choices. At the same time, we look forward to make this an engaging platform for citizens to share their experiences, and work collectively on solutions.

To meet environmental goals and in line with Agenda 2030, policy- and decision- makers need to consider links between environmental policy responses and other goals, such as achieving gender equality and women’s empowerment. In response, the OECD’s 2020 Global Forum on Environment will focus on “Mainstreaming Gender and Empowering Women for Environmental Sustainability”. Identifying the right synergies between gender equality and environmental policies can reinforce both, increasing their respective effectiveness.This Global Forum on Environment will review selected environment-related sectors and policies through a gender and inclusiveness lens, specifically:HealthInfrastructure development, including transport, city and settlement designBiodiversity, agriculture and fisheriesGreen energy and a “just transition”Circular economy, consumption patterns and waste managementEnvironmental justice and the empowerment of women and youth.Participants will have an opportunity to discuss needed transformations at global, national and local levels to achieve both environmental and gender equality goals. March on gender - Mainstreaming Gender and Empowering Women for Environmental Sustainability The Global Forum on Environment brings together policy makers and experts from OECD member and partner countries to share best practices and discuss policy challenges related to the environment agenda. Representatives from business, inter-governmental organisations, research centres, civil society organisations and other relevant institutions are also invited to join the discussions.

Some of the issues we are working on include: market-based solutions to climate change and other environmental challenges, the long-term benefits of migration and a welcoming society, the gains of increased levels of entrepreneurship, the need for modernisation of the welfare sector and the challenges of the rapidly-changing digital society. We hold seminars and roundtable discussions in town halls, parliaments and board rooms, we publish reports, books and policy papers, we put together and chair reference groups around policy issues, we participate in the media debates, and we support policy-makers with relevant facts. We act as a link between curious citizens, opinion-makers, entrepreneurs, policy-makers and researchers, always striving for an open-minded, inclusive and thought-provoking dialogue. The Fores board consists of experienced people from varied professional and political backgrounds. The composition of the board guarantees a strong independence from special interests and partisan politics.

He used his animals, food, medicine, tools, and equipment as collateral, so he could begin producing and earning money. “So, how do I pay for the credit? I use my product to pay them.” The micro-entrepreneur benefits from a collateral registry in Colombia allowing businesses to register moveable assets such as machinery or even their own products as collateral. More than 1.3 million such assets were registered between March 2014 and October 2016 backing loans from lenders, including some of the country’s largest banks. One-fourth backed credit to micro, small, and medium enterprises. Colombia is among the many countries around the world reforming their business regulations to stimulate the private sector and spur economic growth. Between June 2, 2017, and May 1 this year, 128 governments introduced a record 314 reforms benefitting small and medium business and entrepreneurs, enabling job creation, and stimulating private investment. These reforms are tracked – and inspired – by the World Bank Group’s Doing Business Index ranking 190 countries on the ease of doing business within their borders. Image: World Bank “Governments have the enormous task of fostering an environment where entrepreneurs and small and medium enterprises can thrive,” said World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim. “Sound and efficient business regulations are critical for entrepreneurship and a thriving private sector. Without them, we have no chance to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity around the world.” Nurturing entrepreneurs The buy-in for Doing Business was slow to come in many corners of the world after it launched in 2003. The annual ranking has become increasingly influential, as evidenced by the accelerating pace of business regulation reforms in every region. 4 of the 10 top improvers—Afghanistan, Djibouti, Côte d’Ivoire and Togo—are countries suffering from fragility, conflict and violence One-third of all business regulatory reforms were in the economies of Sub-Saharan Africa—a total of 107 reforms and a record for the region 2 countries from Eastern Europe and Central Asia made the top 10: FYR Macedonia in 10th and Georgia, edging up two spots to 6th Brazil recorded the largest score improvement in Latin America and the Caribbean, reforming in four areas.United Arab Emirates entered the top 20 in 11th place. China, one of this year’s top 10 improvers, advanced more than 30 spots to 46th place in the global rankings. India became South Asia’s top-ranked economy, advancing 23 spots to 77th place in the global ranking. “This year’s results clearly demonstrate government commitment in many economies, large and small, to nurture entrepreneurship and private enterprise,” said Rita Ramalho, Senior Manager of the World Bank’s Global Indicators Group, which produces the report. “In addition, there is a wide range of countries reforming this year – it’s more universal. No one questions that these things are important any more, such as the need for a simple process to start a business.” In the last two or three years, “all the large emerging markets – such as China, India, Nigeria, South Africa, Indonesia, Russia – have taken on this agenda,” said Sylvia Solf, head of the World Bank Group’s Reform Advisory Unit, which advises governments on ways to improve the business environment. “The fact that they are doing this is groundbreaking.” Sound and efficient business regulations are critical for entrepreneurship and a thriving private sector. Without them, we have no chance to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity around the world. — Jim Yong Kim, President of the World Bank Group Making it easier to do business By putting the perspective of a small, domestic company at the center of its analysis, Doing Business was revolutionary, said Solf. The index measures reforms in 11 areas: starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts, resolving insolvency, and labor market regulation. The most popular reform is making it easier to start a business. More than a quarter of economies did just that in 2017/18. It now takes an average of 20 days and costs 23% of income per capita to start a business, compared to 47 days and 76% of income per capita in 2006. Thirteen of the top 20 economies have at least one procedure that can be completed online in half a day. Georgia –an early adopter of Doing Business and the second biggest reformer (after Rwanda) – has cut the amount of time to start a business to 2 days. To streamline business registration, the government launched the first Public Service Hall in 2011 – a one-stop-shop of government services. Today, 19 Public Service Halls process clearances for multiple agencies, with the option of online payments by credit card. Obtaining documents is now a simple process for entrepreneurs like Vakhtang Kajrishvili, founder of Tbilisi-based Badagi, a company producing a traditional candy called churchkhelas. “We quickly and easily obtained every necessary document.” Image: © Photo courtesy of Kajrishvili Kajrishvili started with one employee and now has seven shops selling a variety of Georgian products, as well as eight dedicated stalls in a supermarket chain. A recent surge in tourism has made a ‘big difference” to his business and he is eyeing European Union markets. With financing from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the Ministry of Agriculture, he is building a factory for processing fruit. “The biggest challenge now is maintaining high quality within production,” he said. “Soon we will have a Euro standard factory.” Image: World Bank Have you read? The 9 most competitive countries in the world for doing business Which countries have the boldest business leaders? How businesses can support LGBTI rights in countries that oppose them Insights from the biggest reformer, Rwanda Economies that do well in Doing Business generally have a strong e-government to deliver services to citizens and firms. E-government also cuts red tape and reduces corruption, said Ramalho. Strong leadership was key to reforms in Rwanda, Georgia, and Colombia – the first countries to be inspired by Doing Business to reform their regulations. Rwanda and Georgia are the first and second biggest reformers in the history of Doing Business, and Rwanda was again a top reformer this year. “You need to have strong leadership in a sustained and broad way,” said Ramalho. “Doing Business reforms tend to span across government. It’s important to have leadership at the top saying we need to do this.” In Rwanda, there was consensus in the years following the genocide and civil war that the private sector must be the key driver of economic transformation. The government set out to create an environment that would enable businesses and investments to thrive, said Louise Kanyonga, Head of the Rwanda Development Board's Strategy and Competitiveness Department. “Rwanda has adopted a very bold and ambitious approach to reforming its business environment,” she said. “We benchmark ourselves against the best performers in the world and we think big.” She said Doing Business inspired reforms in key areas: Registering property: The reform with the biggest impact. Rwanda completely overhauled the land system to establish property rights and digitized the land registry. Starting a business: Business registrations more than doubled after introducing electronic online business registration. Rwanda has reduced the amount of time needed to start a business from 43 days to a mere 4 days today. Getting credit: Modern secured transactions laws offering strong protections to secured creditors have increased confidence among lenders and expanded access to finance Paying taxes: Simplified tax systems and regulatory reforms increased tax compliance and resulted in higher tax revenues. The small, landlocked African nation has become one of the world’s fastest-growing economies, with a rapidly urbanizing middle class. Kanyonga said private investments have grown by 60% over the last 8 years, and foreign direct investment alone has grown by close to 40%. Yet there is still much to do. Rwanda now needs to position itself as a future-ready economy that can compete on the global stage, she said. “We need to ensure that we are equipping our people with the skills for the future and increasing the adoption of technology and innovation among our firms.” Share License and Republishing World Economic Forum Type may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.

A few decades ago, Winston Churchill said “Never let a good crisis go to waste”. As the world braves one of the most severe crises in our collective memory, all hopes are pinned upon a not-too-distant recovery from the health, social and economic ravages that the pandemic has wrought. On the economic front, one bright spot is that crises can be an opportunity to renew and reinvigorate business ecosystems to rebound on a more innovative footing. Reducing trade barriers and creating an integrated regional market will be key to MENA’s recovery Yet the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region may have difficulties tapping into this post-crisis silver lining unless it makes significant progress on advancing economic and social integration. Unfortunately, MENA is one of the world’s most restrictive regions in goods and services trade. High transport costs and technical barriers also impede progress and, despite advances in the Gulf and elsewhere, logistics lag, especially when it comes to decreasing the cost of cross-border trading. Data show that trade volumes have fallen sharply in the region over the past year—by roughly 20%. The downturn particularly affected sectors with complex value chains due to the weakening of the global logistics industry. Getting trade flowing again will be critical to paving the way for a jobs-rich and sustainable recovery in the region. Use the OECD-WTO Trade in Value Added (TiVA) to compare commercial relations among economies and the process of value creation Despite improvements in recent years, the MENA region also underperforms in access to credit, which is lower than anywhere else in the world. Trading across borders is expensive and time-consuming: it is, on average, three times more expensive and four times longer than in high-income economies. Besides Trade and Non-Trade Barriers, additional obstacles remain such as technical and health standards, the lack of uniform standards and harmonisation and pervasive red tape, all of which hinder both international and regional trade, investment flows and the pipe dream of the creation of an Arab Common Market. This is further aggravated by a variety of overlapping bilateral and multilateral trade agreements, which have not been able to create the necessary conditions for trade to ultimately develop. Opening up markets within the MENA region, and creating an integrated free-trade area, should thus be at the top of policy makers’ priorities to build back better post-COVID. Social and economic policy reform also needed to strengthen trade integration To get there, policy makers will need to look beyond trade reform to rethink underpinning social and economic policies. Administrative reform will be essential in this regard, as institutions play a major role in fostering economic change. For example, reforms to facilitate more e-government could help make government more agile and responsive to the needs of citizens and businesses alike, as well as accelerate entrepreneurship. Reforms to ease access to finance for firms are also critical. The business ecosystem in the MENA region should endorse multiple and competing sources of finance for micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), including asset-based finance, alternative forms of debt, crowdfunding, hybrid tools and equity instruments, such as business angels. A skilled, digitally savvy workforce will also be key to a jobs-rich recovery. Stronger private sector engagement with the vocational education and training (VET) sector at the regional level would enable both parties to ensure that workers have the skills that companies need. According to a recent report by the World Economic Forum, 13.5% of emerging jobs will arise from technology-related business. This will lead to the emergence of 97 million new roles but could cause the displacement of at least 85 million jobs. In the MENA region—where youth unemployment rates are among the highest globally (Palestine 40.1%; Jordan 39.2%; Tunisia 34.4%; Algeria 26.9%; Egypt 24.7%; Lebanon 23.3% etc.), and even higher for young women—it is essential that market entrants have the right competencies. Currently, the region suffers from a labour market mismatch where rising levels of academic achievement among youth are leading to lower employability outcomes. This illustrates that the VET sector in MENA was unable to absorb the COVID-19 crisis and to tackle the issue of reskilling and upskilling the workforce by handling job transition issues. Read more on the Forum Network: ""Towards a Woman-Powered Recovery in MENA: Now is the time to break remaining barriers for women’s empowerment"" by Juan Yermo, Chief of Staff to the Secretary-General, OECD MENA partnering with the OECD to pave the way to a sustainable and inclusive recovery In the MENA region, as elsewhere, the pandemic has been an accelerator of pre-existing trends (digitalisation, gig data, alternative inclusive finance for impact) but it has also created new strategic needs and opportunities such as reshoring and nearshoring. To seize these opportunities, MENA economies will need to become more resilient. In recent years, MENA governments have enacted laws and incentives going in this direction. Some examples include the StartUp Act in April 2018 in Tunisia; the new law on incentives and innovation in 2018 in Egypt; and the InnovInvest Fund created in Morocco to finance startups, as well as set up business angel networks, accelerators, incubators, co-working spaces and fablabs. Moreover, before and during the crisis, MENA entrepreneurs have demonstrated they can be innovative and bold to meet changing demands. They have shown their readiness to be at the head of accelerating regional and sub-regional trade. Including all voices into the reform process will be at the crux of building this resilience in the region to ensure that reforms can take hold and flourish. Involving employers, business support organisations, trade unions, civil society organisations, governments and private sector representatives in reform design and implementation will be at the core of this future strategy. The OECD’s MENA Competitiveness Programme, and its MENA-OECD Business Advisory Board, provides a valued platform for public-private dialogue for the benefit of this regional ecosystem. Private actors, business associations and chambers of commerce play an important role to support crisis response and recovery. Twenty-five years after the Barcelona process, and looking beyond the COVID crisis, the time is now to reset the clock in MENA and unleash the talent of its citizens and businesses to drive the robust and inclusive recovery the region needs.

Such a virtual network constitutes a research field that differs from the study of formal networks. Formal networks are real in the sense of officially acknowledged and immediately open to empirical validation. Virtual networks on the other hand display shared ideas. Social network analysis tools can be applied to find out if or to what extent virtual networks are real networks that display linkages (membership in networks, personnel, resources etc.). Unconnected think tanks in turn can be considered special cases in need of explanation independent from network structures (unless we have to assume invisible, hidden or covered ties). Austerity politics, Behavioural economics in public governance Last revision 9.06.2017 The following coordinate was not recognized: 59.320220;18.064585.The following coordinate was not recognized: 59.320220;18.064585. »FORES (Forum for Reforms, Entrepreneurship and Sustainability) is an independent research foundation dedicated to furthering entrepreneurship and sustainable development through market solutions. The goal is to adapt the microeconomic incentive structures for the twin challenges of accelerated globalization and global warming. FORES was founded in 2007 when the Swedish Centre Party, the Bertil Ohlin Institute and Studieförbundet Vuxenskolan took the initiative by contacting Martin Ådahl, founder and previous editor-in-chief of the Swedish news magazine Fokus and former senior economist at the Swedish Central Bank. FORES' main activities is to initiate research projects that will result in concrete reform proposals in relevant policy areas such as: Market solutions to environmental issues Harnessing the positive potential of immigration The role of civil society in entrepreneurship The flexibility of labour markets The protection of the integrity of the individual Modernising public services In so doing FORES is relying heavily on a vast network of academics. The business model is that of modern network organisation with a small core of research managers and communication officers supporting and coordinating a vast network of researchers and experts. Papers and books from the Institute are subjected to peer review processes. FORES is calling upon researchers at universities and research institutions in Sweden (and some abroad), not least the regional universities, notably those prominent in empirical social sciences. The institute is also making full use of new media, with the homepage being it's most important communication tool, supplementing written reports and books with audiovisual material and interactive forums. To ensure the independence of the institute it has been constituted as a foundation with a board of directors composed of academics, experienced former politicians, business people and opinion leaders.«[1] Contents 1 Organizational Structure and Funding 1.1 Address 1.2 People 1.2.1 Executive board 1.2.2 Staff 1.2.3 Advisory board 1.2.4 Supervisory board 2 Topics 3 Semantic Fields 4 References Organizational Structure and Funding Fores was founded by the Centerpartiet, the Bertil Ohlin Institute and the Studieförbundet Vuxenskolan Address Bellmansgatan 10, 11820 Stockholm People Executive board People leading the Think Tank in the day to day business (CEOs, directorates etc.).

This list is going to be steadily extended. However we try to preserve a persistent list of topics. Semantic Fields What we call here a semantic field is the idea to categorize think tanks in a two level system. The first levels are so called 'Virtual Networks' and the second are the semantic fields. Accordingly every semantic field entered here has to be attached to a virtual network. If you would like to follow a special phenomenon among think tanks please contact us and we are going to add a new virtual network. Semantic fields are topics that promote a virtual network. Lets take climate change as an example: 'climate change skeptics' is the virtual network and 'adaption instead of mitigation' would be one possible semantic field.

Over the years, the Forum has been a place to discuss the most pressing issues facing both the Russian Federation as well as global economies. This year’s event will be no different, with participants including leading government figures; senior executives from major corporations and financial institutions; renowned experts; and pioneering entrepreneurs. The need for open, constructive dialogue is particularly evident today. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted all countries across the globe, and has severely restricted international ties. It is vital to work together as we forge a path to recovery. Other socioeconomic issues such as poverty relief, improving education opportunities, expanding employment and prospects for labour markets, as well as addressing violations of fair competition principles also require careful attention. We must now endeavour to build equal, constructive partnerships between members of the global community and expand business ties on a number of levels to effectively tackle today’s critical global challenges and achieve sustainable development. We have long worked towards these ends through the Eurasian Economic Union, which has promoted principles of free trade, and facilitated mutually beneficial investments and common technological development. The Russian Federation is also interested in closer economic, scientific, and technical cooperation with partners in other regions. We are ready to share our experience in areas such as healthcare and digitalisation, and to work with partners to build better telecommunications, energy, and transport infrastructure. We also recognize the importance of creating effective frameworks to cooperate in addressing key issues facing the environment and climate. I firmly believe that the agreements reached at the Forum will contribute to the development of international relations and facilitate the implementation of new economic projects for the benefit of all our countries and peoples. I wish you a productive, rewarding and successful event. Vladimir Putin",Forum for Reforms and Entrepreneurship

Charitable Tax-Exempt Status IRS Tax Exempt Rulings Charitable tax exempt Ruling INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY DISTRICT DIRECTOR 51 HOPKINS PLAZA BALTIMORE, ND 21201 THE INFINITY FOUNDATION A NEW JERSEY NON-PROFIT CORPORATION Accounting Period Ending: June 30 Addendum Applies: Yes Dear Applicant: Based on information supplied, and assuming your operations will be as stated in your application for recognition of exemption, we have determined you are exempt from Federal income tax under section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code as an organization described in section 501(c)(3). We have further determined that, as indicated in your application, you are a private foundation within the meaning of section 509(a) of the Code. In this letter we are not determining whether you are an operating foundation as defined in section 4942(j)(3). If your sources of support, or your purposes, character, or method of operation change, please let us know so we can consider the effect of the change on your exempt status and foundation status. In the case of an amendment to your organizational document or bylaws, please send us a copy of the amended document or bylaws. Also, you should inform us of all changes in your name or address. As of January 1, 1984, you are liable for taxes under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (social security taxes) on remuneration of $100 or more you pay to each of your employees during a calendar year. You are not liable for the tax imposed under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA). However, since you are a private foundation, you are subject to excise taxes under Chapter 42 of the Code. You also may be subject to other Federal excise taxes. If you have any questions about excise, employment, or other Federal taxes, please let us know. Donors may deduct contributions to you as provided in section 170 of the Code. Bequests, legacies, devises, transfers, or gifts to you or for your use are deductible for Federal estate and gift tax purposes if they meet the applicable provisions of sections 2055, 2106, and 2522 of the Code. Contribution deductions are allowable to donors only to the extent that their contributions are gifts, with no consideration received. Ticket purchases and similar payments in conjunction with fundraising events may not necessarily qualify as deductible contributions, depending on the circumstances. See Revenue Ruling 67-246, published in Cumulative Bulletin 1967-2, on page 104, which sets forth guidelines regarding the deductibility, as charitable contributions, of payments made by taxpayers for admission to or other participation in fundraising activities for charity. You are required to file Fora 990-PF, Return of Private Foundation or Section 4947(a)(1) Trust Treated as a Private Foundation. Form 990-PF must be filed by the 15th day of the fifth month after the end of your annual accounting period. A penalty of $10 a day is charged when a return is filed late, unless there is reasonable cause for the delay. However, the maximum penalty charged cannot exceed $5,000 or 5 percent of your gross receipts for the year, whichever is less. This penalty may also be charged if a return is not complete, so please be sure your return is complete before you file it. You are not required to file Federal income tax returns unless you are subject to the tax on unrelated business income under section 511 of the Code. If you are subject to this tax, you must file an income tax return on Form 990-T, Exempt Organization Business Income Tax Return. In this letter we are not determining whether any of your present or proposed activities are unrelated trade or business as defined in section 513 of the Code. You need an employer identification number even if you have no employees. If an employer identification number was not entered on your application, a number will be assigned to you and you will be advised of it. Please use that number on all returns you file and in all correspondence with the Internal Revenue Service. This determination is based on evidence that your funds are dedicated to the purposes listed in section 501(c)(3) of the Code. To assure your continued exemption, you should maintain records to show that funds are expended only for those purposes. If you distribute funds to other organizations, your records should show whether they are exempt under section 501(c)(3). In cases where the recipient organization is not exempt under section 501(c)(3), there should be evidence that the funds will remain dedicated to the required purposes and that they will be used for those purposes by the recipient. If distributions are made to individuals, case histories regarding the recipients should be kept showing names, addresses, purposes of awards, manner of selection, relationship (if any) to members, officers, trustees or donors of funds to you, so that any and all distributions made to individuals can be substantiated upon request by the Internal Revenue Service. (Revenue Ruling 56-304, C.B. 1956-2, page 306.) If we have indicated in the heading of this letter that an addendum applies, the addendum enclosed is an integral part of this letter. Because this letter could help resolve any questions about your exempt status and foundation status, you should keep it in your permanent records. As a private foundation, you must comply with the expenditure responsibility requirements under sections 4945(d)(4) and 4945(h) of the Code, and section 53.4945-5 of the Income Tax Regulations. You are required to make available for public inspection a copy of your exemption application, and supporting documents, and this exemption letter. You are also required to make a copy of your return available for public inspection in accordance with section 6104(d) of the Internal Revenue Code. Failure to make these documents available for public inspection may subject you to a penalty of $10 per day for each day there is a failure to comply (up to a maximum of $5,000 in the case of an annual return). See Internal Revenue Service Notice 88-120, C.B. 454 for additional information.

One of your programs will be the awarding of grants to individuals for travel, study, fellowships or scholarships or for the production of a product which supports the Topic. A grantee’s activities in pursuit of the Topic might involve study, research, writing, teaching, lecturing, attending an educational institution as a visiting scholar, developing or speaking at a symposium, publishing a treatise in either print or electronic media, or engaging in any other activity which would serve to improve the skills or talents or broaden the understanding of the grantee in the Topic area, and which would make a contribution to the body of knowledge in the Topic area. In the grant application the prospective grantee will describe his or her project in support of the Topic. You will select grantees under procedures described below, monitor their projects, and evaluate their work to assure that grant funds are properly utilized. You describe your grant-making procedures as follows: Grant recipients will not be chosen from any particular educational or scientific institution, or from any particular geographic location. The key criterion will be a demonstrated commitment to the Topic area A grant recipient must either be an individual whose activities will make a contribution to the Topic, or whose funded project(s) will enhance the knowledge, or improve the skills and talents of the grantee in the Topic area. A grantee must be either (i) a scholar, teacher, visionary, or spiritual leader whose work would be enhanced by a grant from you, or (ii) a student attending an educational institution described in Code section 151(c)(4), in which case the grant would be utilized for the grantee’s tuition and related expenses at such educational institution as long as the course of study pursued by the student would further the purposes of the grant. Your Board of Directors will contact both traditional and nontraditional educational, scientific, cultural,and religious institutions to make known the availability of the grants. You will also publicize the grant program in various publications and make the grant applications generally available to the public. Your Board of Directors will select grant recipients from among the individuals who submit completed applications. You will pay the grant funds directly to the grant recipient, except where the grant will be used to cover tuition at an educational institution, in which instance you will make payment to the school. Each grant recipient must agree in writing to use the grant funds to defray the expenses associated with the approved project or to apply the funds to enrollment in an educational institution. You intend to award grants on an objective and nondiscriminatory basis. You will not use grant funds to compensate recipients for performing personal services for you. You will not award any grants to your creator, founder, officers, or directors, or to members of the founder’s family, or to any disqualified person with respect to you, or for a purpose that is inconsistent with the purposes set forth in Code section 170(c) (2)(B). With respect to the monitoring of grants, you provide the following information: you require a written progress report from each grantee at least once a year. This report must include a summary of the use of the funds awarded, and how such use fulfilled grant purposes. If the grantee is enrolled at an educational institution, the report must be verified by the institution. You also require a final report. A condition of each grant made to support the enrollment of a grantee at an educational institution is that the grant will be used only for qualified tuition and related expenses within the meaning of Code section 117(b)(2) and for room and board. In those instances where the reports submitted, or other information (including the failure to submit reports) indicate that all or any part of a grant is not being used for intended purposes, you will investigate and will withhold further payments to the extent possible until you receive delinquent reports. If you learn that all or any part of a grant is being diverted from the intended purposes, you will take all reasonable and appropriate steps to recover the grant funds and/or to ensure restoration of the diverted funds to the purposes of the grant. This would include legal action if deemed appropriate under the circumstances. You shall retain complete records with respect to all grants awarded. These records shall include all information obtained by you to evaluate the qualifications of potential grantees, the identification of grantees (including any relationship of any grantee to you or to any of your directors or officers), the completed application of each grantee, the amount of each grant, the date(s) of each grant payment, evaluation reports from grantees, and any additional information that you may secure in the course of the grant administration process. Section 4945(a)(1) of the Code imposes an initial tax on a private foundation for each taxable expenditure it makes. If such expenditure is not corrected within the taxable period, then additional taxes are imposed under section 4945(b)(1). Section 4945(d)(3) of the Code provides that a “taxable expenditure” includes any amount paid or incurred by a private foundation as a grant to an individual for travel, study, or other similar purposes by such individual, unless such grant satisfies the requirements of subsection (g). Section 4945(g) of the Code provides, in part, that subsection (d)(3) shall not apply to an individual grant awarded on an objective and nondiscriminatory basis pursuant to a procedure approved in advance by the Service, if it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Service that (1) the grant constitutes a scholarship or fellowship grant which would be subject to the provisions of section l17(a) (as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1986) and is to be used for study at an educational organization described in section 170(b) (1) (A)(ii), or (2) the purpose of the grant is to achieve a specific objective, produce a report or other similar product, or improve or enhance a literary, artistic, musical, scientific, teaching, or other similar capacity, skill or talent of the grantee. Section 53.4945-4(b) (1) of the Foundation and similar Excise Taxes Regulations provides that in order for a private foundation to establish that its grants to individuals are made on an objective and nondiscriminatory basis, it must demonstrate that its grant program is consistent with: the existence of the foundation’s exempt status under section 501(c)(3); the allowance of deductions to individuals under section 170 for contributions to the granting foundation; and the requirements of subparagraphs (2), (3), and (4) of this paragraph. Section 53.4945-(4)(b)(2) of the regulations provides that the group from which grantees are to be selected must be sufficiently broad so that the awarding of grants to members of such group would fulfill a purpose described in section 170(c)(2)((B). However, the foundation may impose reasonable restrictions on the group of potential grantees. For example, selection of a qualified research scientist to work on a particular project does not violate the requirements of section 4945(d)(3) merely because the foundation selects him from a group of three scientists who are experts in that field. Section 53.4945-4(b) (3) of the regulations states that the criteria used in selecting grant recipients from the potential grantees should be related to the purpose of the grant. Section 53.4945-4(b)(4) of the regulations provides that the person or group of persons who select recipients of grants should not be in a position to derive a private benefit, directly or indirectly, if certain potential grantees are selected over others. Section 53.4945-4(c)(3) of the regulations provides that with respect to a grant made under section 4945(g)(3), the private foundation shall require reports on the use of the funds and the progress made by the grantee toward achieving the purposes for which the grant was made. Such reports must be made at least once a year. Upon completion of the undertaking for which the grant was made, a final report must be made. Section 53.4945-4(c)(4) of the regulations sets forth procedures for the investigation of jeopardized grants. Briefly, where the private foundation has evidence that funds are being diverted from intended purpose, then the foundation is required to either recover the funds or to ensure their restoration to proper grant purposes. The foundation must also cut off all further payments until it has received the grantee’s assurance that future diversions will not occur. The information furnished by you in your ruling request indicates that your procedures for awarding grants satisfy the fundamental requirements of objectively and nondiscrimination and otherwise conform to the requirements of sections 4945(g) (1) and (3) and corresponding regulations. Accordingly, we rule that grants made in accordance with procedures described herein will not be taxable expenditures under Code 4945(d) (3). We have not considered whether grants made under your procedures are excludable from the gross income of recipients under section 117 of the Code. This ruling is conditioned on the understanding that there will be no material change in the facts upon which it is based. It is further conditioned on the premise that no grants or loans will be awarded to your organization’s creators, officers, directors, trustees, or members of the selection committee, or for a purpose that is inconsistent with the purposes described in section 170(c) (2) (B). The approval of your grant-making procedures is a one time approval of your system of standards and procedures for selecting recipients of grants that meet the requirements of section 4945(g). Thus, approval will apply to succeeding grant programs only as long as the standards and procedures under which they are conducted do not differ materially from those described in your request. We are sending a copy of this ruling to your key District Director for exempt organizations matters. Because this letter could resolve any questions about your exempt status, you should keep it with your permanent records. If you have any question, please contact the person whose name and telephone number are shown in the heading of this letter. This ruling is directed only to the organization that requested it. Section 6110(j) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code provides that it may not be used or cited as precedent. Thank you for your cooperation. Sincerely, Gerald V.

Given accurate and complete information, and the opportunity to make a choice, people will choose products or actions that improve or do not degrade the environment. However, not everyone in our society has a choice about the quality of his or her environment. Those who most need the Environmental Law Foundation’s resources are those who lack choice and lack access to the political and economic power that ensures choice. ELF’s purpose is to improve environmental quality for those most at risk by providing access to information, strategies, and enforcement of environmental, toxics, and community right-to-know laws. ELF complements the approach of other environmental law groups by enforcing existing environmental regulations, providing a bridge of direct service to people in need, and serving as the critical link between at-risk communities and the legal, scientific, financial, and other resources they need to effectively address environmental problems. ELF’s goals include: The development and implementation of innovative strategies to address environmental problems. Targeting investigations and assistance to those with the least choice about and who are the most vulnerable to environmental risks. Ensuring that companies provide complete and accurate consumer information about the environmental impacts of products and practices. Reducing the risks from toxic exposure.

This list includes cases in active litigation; see also our list of prior victories. ELF v. State Water Resources Control Board Groundwater pollution data secrecy On March 28, 2018, ELF filed suit against the California State Water Resources Control Board, asking the court to invalidate a general permit for agriculture in the Central Valley that permits growers to keep key water quality data secret. Nitrate emitted from irrigated agriculture contaminates drinking water wells throughout the state. ELF’s case would enforce the state’s own policy that requires making this data available to the public. Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate, filed March 28, 2018 ELF v. State Water Resources Control Board et al. Protecting groundwater through the public trust doctrine ELF, along with Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen’s Associations and Institute for Fisheries Resources, filed a lawsuit against the State Water Resources Control Board and Siskiyou County for violations of the California public trust doctrine. The State and County failed to manage groundwater extractions in the Scott River subbasin in a manner consistent with their duties under the public trust doctrine. As a result, numerous wells extract groundwater during irrigation season, causing a decreased flow in the Scott River and injuring the river’s populations of salmon and steelhead. This lawsuit was brought to protect the Scott River through better groundwater management by these responsible public entities. In August 2018, the California Court of Appeal ruled that even after the enactment of the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act in 2014, these governmental entities are under an obligation to consider the possible negative effects of groundwater pumping on nearby navigable rivers. Siskiyou County sought review at the California Supreme Court, but review was denied on November 28, 2018. The Court of Appeal’s decision is now definitive law in California. Second Amended Petition for Writ of Mandate, filed October 4, 2013 Press Release, June 24, 2010 Frequently Asked Questions Daily Journal article, August 2, 2011 Order on Cross Motions for Judgment on the Pleadings, July 15, 2014 Press Release, July 16, 2014 Order on Motions for Summary Judgment, August 4, 2016 Court of Appeal Opinion, August 29, 2018 Press Release, September 5, 2018 Zamora et al. v. Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board Central Coast groundwater pollution data secrecy On May 8, 2015, the Environmental Law Foundation, in cooperation with California Rural Legal Assistance and the First Amendment Project, filed a lawsuit seeking an end to the Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board’s policy of keeping groundwater pollution data secret. On October 28, 2016, in a victory for local residents and the environment, a San Luis Obispo judge ruled that the board had improperly allowed an agricultural coalition to keep important water pollution records and data from the public. Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate, filed May 8, 2015 Press Release, May 11, 2015 Order Granting Petition for Writ of Mandate, October 28, 2016 Agricultural Water Efficiency On July 11, 2014, ELF announced its intention to sue 22 California water districts if they do not come into compliance with a law requiring them to take basic steps towards water efficiency. Press release Letters to the water districts California water plan compliance map ELF v. Beech-Nut Nutrition Corp. et al. Lead in baby food and children’s food On September 28, 2011, the Environmental Law Foundation filed a lawsuit alleging the toxic chemical lead was found in a variety of children’s and baby foods. The food categories are: grape juice, packaged pears and peaches, fruit cocktail, and baby foods containing carrots peaches, pears and sweet potatoes. The lawsuit seeks warning labels on the offending foods under Proposition 65. Complaint, filed September 28, 2011 List of all the products tested, including those that do not require a warning for lead and those that do Frequently Asked Questions News Release Baby Food Guide Children’s Food Guide Tentative Decision, July 15, 2013 Contreras et al. v. First Student Inc. False Claims Act Two former Laidlaw mechanics are joined by ELF in litigation against Laidlaw Transit, Inc. (now First Student Inc.) for violating its contract with the San Francisco Unified School District. The lawsuit alleges that Laidlaw operates unsafe, polluting school buses. The lawsuit is filed under the False Claims Act and seeks payment to the District for substandard services. Press Release First Amended Complaint, filed February 6, 2008 Letter from SFUSD to Laidlaw Letter from Laidlaw to SFUSD ELF et al. v. Laidlaw Transit Inc. et al. Children’s exposure to diesel engine exhaust ELF is joined by Our Children’s Earth Foundation and Communities for a Better Environment in litigation against Laidlaw Transit, Inc. and Durham School Services, two of the largest school bus contractors in North America, for failing to warn parents that children who ride diesel buses are exposed to diesel engine exhaust, a mixture of chemicals known to cause cancer. Recent studies have shown that a significant amount of the pollution on a school bus is “self-pollution” from the bus’s own exhaust and a child riding inside a diesel school bus may be exposed to as much as four times the level of toxic diesel engine exhaust as someone riding in a car along the same route. The lawsuit is filed under California’s Proposition 65 (the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986) and seeks a court order to provide warnings about the diesel engine exhaust by the time the next school year starts. Complaint, filed May 2, 2006 First Amended Complaint, filed January 3, 2007 Diesel Health Background Info Sheet Settlement with Laidlaw, August 6, 2008 Settlement with Durham, August 7, 2008 Hillman et al. v. Cal. Dept. of Fish and Game et al. Suction dredge mining In 2009, ELF, on behalf of a coalition of Native Americans, environmentalists and fishermen from across the State, was granted a preliminary injunction that required the Department of Fish and Game to stop issuing any permits for suction dredge mining. A month later, Governor Schwarzenegger signed a new bill that required even current permit holders to immediately cease all suction dredge mining. Both acts effectively ban all suction dredge mining on all waters throughout the state of California until the Department of Fish and Game conducts an environmental review of its permitting program, adopts new regulations that protect fish and their habitat from the harmful impacts of suction dredging, and all challenges to those new regulations are resolved. The miners have brought legal challenges to both the injunction and the legislation. We effectively defeated the challenge to the legislation and the law is still in effect. The challenge to the court order is currently being fought in the appellate court, but we believe that the superior court’s ruling was soundly based and will withstand the challenge. Meanwhile, ELF with a large coalition of tribes, environmentalists and fishermen from all over California and Oregon are working in the regulatory process to ensure that Fish and Game’s draft environmental report and draft regulations, released to the public in March of 2011, will safeguard fish and other species and their habitat from the destructive impacts of suction dredge mining. Preliminary Injunction, July 10, 2009 Center for Biological Diversity et al. v. FPL Group et al. Public trust—amicus curiae brief ELF submitted an amicus curiae brief in this landmark case, spearheaded by the Center for Biological Diversity. CBD sued power companies for the operation of aging wind turbines on Altamont Pass, which kill thousands of raptors and other birds each year, on the theory that their operation violates the public trust doctrine. In a unanimous opinion, the First Appellate District of the California Court of Appeal held that the public trust doctrine does extend to the protection of birds and other wildlife. Brief of Amicus Curiae, January 28, 2008 Court Opinion, September 18, 2008 Order Modifying Opinion, October 9, 2008 ELF v. Southern California Gas Co. et al. BTEX contamination of protected aquifers In California, water is our most precious natural resource. Unfortunately, California’s precious resource is being contaminated with chemicals that cause cancer and birth defects, chemiclas that include Benzene, Toluene and Ethylbenzene (“BTEX”). Southern California Gas Company operates a natural gas storage reservoir in the densely populated Playa del Rey region of Los Angeles. Wells from this underground gas storage reservoir are leaking and releasing BTEX into the Ballona, Silverado and Gage Aquifers, which are protected sources of drinking water under California’s water quality protection plan. This action seeks, among other remedies, civil penalties and injunctive relief to redress the discharge of BTEX from Defendants’ wells in violation of California’s Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (“Proposition 65”). Complaint, filed January 11, 2007 Exhibit 1 Exhibit 2 Exhibit 3 Exhibit 4 Exhibit 5 Frequently Asked Questions Press Release Karuk Tribe of California v. U.S. Forest Service Endangered salmon ELF is representing the Karuk Tribe of California in its lawsuit alleging the Six Rivers and Klamath National Forests are permitting illegal mining activities in and along the Salmon, Klamath, and Scott Rivers and their tributaries. The lawsuit addresses the proliferation of essentially unregulated suction dredge and other mining in these National Forests. The Forest Service’s failure to properly regulate mining in these watersheds threatens Tribal Trust Resources, threatens the Tribe’s efforts to restore these fisheries to subsistence harvest levels, and violates the federal government’s trust responsibilities owed to the Tribe. The Forest Service’s actions violate numerous federal environmental laws. The agency is violating their own Forest Plans and the National Forest Management Act by permitting mining in these waterways without requiring a Plan of Operations for each proposed mining operation. The agency is mandated to ensure there won’t be degradation to the natural resources which includes the salmon and their habitat. Further, the Forest Service is not preparing the appropriate NEPA document for each of these operations, let alone for combined or grouped operations, thereby preventing the agency from analyzing and balancing the potential environmental damage from suction dredge mining. Along with these failures, the Forest Service is allowing these operations to proceed without the required consultation with NOAA Fisheries/National Marine Fisheries Service and/or Fish and Wildlife Service, as required by Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act to ensure the agency’s action will not jeopardize the listed Coho salmon and other listed species and/or their habitat. Finally, the Forest Service has not ensured that all discharges from mining operations it has or will authorize or allow will comply with all applicable water quality standards and requirements, in violation of the Clean Water Act and the Organic Act. Second Amended Complaint, filed January 31, 2005 Klamath-Siskiyou Wild et al. v. U.S. Forest Service Timber sale Working with the Pacific Environmental Advocacy Center in Oregon, ELF is representing several conservation groups in a challenge to the Meteor timber sale near the Salmon River on the Klamath National Forest. The claims involved in this case address the failure to comply with the Northwest Forest Plan's protection of old growth forests snags, and riparian areas; NEPA's requirement to consider a reasonable range of alternatives; NFMA's requirement to maintain viable populations of species, and to comply with state water quality laws; and the CWA's requirement to comply with state water quality standards. First Amended Complaint, filed March 23, 2005 ELF et al. v. Laidlaw Transit Inc. et al. Children’s exposure to diesel engine exhaust ELF is joined by Our Children’s Earth Foundation and Communities for a Better Environment in litigation against Laidlaw Transit, Inc. and Durham School Services, two of the largest school bus contractors in North America, for failing to warn parents that children who ride diesel buses are exposed to diesel engine exhaust, a mixture of chemicals known to cause cancer. Recent studies have shown that a significant amount of the pollution on a school bus is “self-pollution” from the bus’s own exhaust and a child riding inside a diesel school bus may be exposed to as much as 4 times the level of toxic diesel engine exhaust as someone riding in a car along the same route. The lawsuit is filed under California’s Proposition 65 (the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986) and seeks a court order to provide warnings about the diesel engine exhaust by the time the next school year starts. Complaint, filed May 2, 2006 ELF v. Birds Eye Foods, Inc. et al. Acrylamide in potato chips With Rose, Klein & Marias, LLP and The Law Office of Gideon Krakov, ELF is suing potato chip manufacturers and California retailers for failing to warn consumers about high levels of a cancer-causing chemical, acrylamide, in potato chips. This lawsuit seeks to enforce California's powerful right-to-know law, Prop 65, which requires that manufacturers warn consumers when their products expose them to cancer-causing chemicals. In this situation, significant amounts of a potent carcinogen, acrylamide, is formed during the processing of potato chips. California voters gave themselves the right to know about carcinogens in food in 1986, however, powerful junk food companies have been lobbying to keep this information under wraps and warnings off potato chip bags. Complaint, filed August 8, 2006 ELF et.al v. Cost Plus, Inc. et al. Lead in balsamic vinegar This is a series of Proposition 65 cases concerning lead in balsamic wine vinegar. These cases are among the first to bring California's powerful right-to-know law into the grocery store. Complaint against Cost Plus, Inc. et al., filed June 5, 2003 Complaint against Borges UCA, Inc. et al., filed February 20, 2004 Complaint against Albeco, Inc. et al., filed October 13, 2004 Copyright © 2021 Environmental Law Foundation.

Our current President is HRH The Prince of Wales. The charity was founded in 1992 and recently celebrated its 25th Anniversary. We help the voice of ordinary people and communities to be heard on matters affecting the environment in which they live. View our current cases here. It’s about participation and access to justice. It’s about your views and feelings – not ours or any ‘green elite’ – on the quality of the air you breathe, on the open spaces, wildlife, land use and waterways near your home. It’s about promoting the collective, good decision-making which is at the very heart of civilised, democratic and stable societies. We do this by providing free information and guidance in-house on environmental issues for individuals and communities,  also through our university based law clinics, and via our network of specialist environmental lawyers and technical experts. We exist primarily to help socially and economically disadvantaged communities which want to address their concerns, but lack the resources or information to do so. All, however, are welcome to enquire. To find out how to use our services, please click here. Our Leadership Team ELF’s day to day management is undertaken by Emma Montlake and Tom Brenan. Emma Montlake Emma Montlake is ELF’s Case Director and has direct responsibility for the management of the case work. Amongst many other duties. Having trained as a lawyer Emma worked in commercial property for ten years but gave up her role in commercial practice so she could intern with ELF. After 3 months most fortuitously a job came up at ELF which Emma took. That was in 2006. Emma is passionate about nature and wildlife and assisting ELF communities to protect the nature that they love and value. Her inspiration is the local people she works with through ELF, who take on the challenge of seeking to protect their environment from threats faced, in the face of complex legal technicalities and processes and lack of resources. Emma is also a trustee at Sussex Wildlife Trust and sees synergies between the work she does at ELF and SWT. She is also a founder member of Green United. Helping school children in Lewes take environmental action. Tom Brenan Tom is ELF’s Education & Policy Director and is responsible for ELF’s University network and Young ELF programme. A qualified solicitor, Tom first connected with ELF as in intern in 2005 and has worked in a variety of roles for the organisation over the years. He has also worked with the National Trust, the Gaia Foundation, WinACC, and the Biodynamic Land Trust. A keen permaculturalist, grower, and Rights of Nature advocate, Tom seeks to tread a more Earth-centred path. He maintains one hand in the soil and the other in the law.

Donate now Do something great to support our people and planet There are lots of different ways that you can support us. We’re a charity and we couldn’t continue our work without your help. Over the past 25 years the Environmental Law Foundation (ELF) has established a cross-disciplinary network of professional members who each year provide a significant amount of pro bono advice and assistance to socially and economically disadvantaged communities across the UK who contact ELF seeking environmental justice. We empower local people to address all manner of adverse environmental issues and challenges. We help them to protect wildlife habitats and public green spaces. We improve the levels of public participation in environmental decision-making. ELF sees itself as a network of environmentally interested people and communities who all contribute to ELF’s mission of increasing access to environmental justice for all. Through ELF’s network of pro-bono law university clinics, environmental law academics and professional adviser network of scientists and environmental lawyers and barristers, we bring together a rich diversity of environmental support to the communities that approach us for assistance. With an ever growing public and professional membership including those communities that we are able to support through the provision of free legal environmental and planning advice and guidance, we recognise that it is through the environmental networks that ELF builds, that we can increasingly support each other. If you are an environmental law or science professional or a local environmental community group, please join ELF and become part of this community of interested people. Become a sponsor Community members Professional Pro Bono members Univeristy Law Clinics ELF University Network An overview Since the 2008 collapse of widespread grant funding for charities, including ours, ELF has adapted radically to enable us to do more good work, with much less cash. Today, instead of a team of managers and student interns based in central London offices, initial calls are fielded by a service kindly provided by Irwin Mitchell. Simpler and essentially academic cases, are handled by a network of ELF university-based law clinics. This leaves our in-house A&R lawyer free to focus on direct advice and liaising between client communities and our network of pro bono specialist environmental lawyers. These changes have proved beneficial for our member lawyers, for the supervised student lawyers who love working on real ELF cases and especially for the communities we serve. They have also reduced our costs to the point at which, whilst we cannot yet survive on membership fees and donations alone, we could survive, run the charity better and grow towards full sustainability, on fees & donations plus £30,000 per year.

Our work consistently improves environmental quality for those most at risk by providing access to information, strategies and enforcement of environmental, toxics, and community right-to-know laws. Recent Events Karuk Tribe and ELF Petition for Scott River Flows On July 1, 2021, ELF filed a petition on behalf of itself and the Karuk Tribe requesting that the California State Water Resources Control Board fulfill its duty under the public trust doctrine and exercise its authority under the Governor’s drought proclamation to set an emergency minimum flow standard for the Scott River. Low flows as a result of overextraction of water are driving salmon populations to extinction. Swift action by the State Board can protect this culturally and ecologically precious resource for the future. Petition for Emergency Rulemaking, July 1, 2021 Press release, July 1, 2021 Sustainable Groundwater Management in Siskiyou County On May 10, 2021, ELF submitted comments on Siskiyou County’s proposed Groundwater Sustainability Plan for the Scott Valley. ELF’s comments seek to ensure that the final plan, when adopted, addresses concerns over the plan’s analysis of undesirable results in stream flows, failure to set measurable objectives and minimum flow thresholds, and lack of consideration of impacts to surface water quality. The comments also urge Siskiyou County to take action to protect public trust resources in the Scott Valley. Comment Letter on Scott Valley Groundwater Sustainability Plan, May 10, 2021 Consumers’ Right to Know About Glyphosate On February 19, 2021, ELF and the Natural Resources Defense Council, United Steelworkers, Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments, As You Sow, Californians for Pesticide Reform, Center for Food Safety, Clean Water Action, Pesticide Action Network North America, and San Francisco Bay Physicians for Social Responsibility submitted a friend-of-the-court brief to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in a case brought by Monsanto and a consortium of agribusiness groups against Proposition 65, California’s safe drinking water and toxic chemical right-to-know law. The brief urges the court to reject a rule that would allow Monsanto to use the First Amendment to avoid giving warnings about glyphosate, a probable carcinogen, by highlighting the robust scientific process agencies use to list dangerous chemicals. Amicus Brief in Becerra v. National Association of Wheat Growers, February 19, 2021 Sustainable Groundwater Management in the San Joaquin Valley ELF has joined with the Law Offices of Thomas N. Lippe to represent the California Sportfishing Protection Alliance in its lawsuit challenging the coordinated groundwater sustainability plan for the Delta-Mendota Subbasin in California’s San Joaquin Valley. Decades of groundwater mismanagement in the basin have led to overdraft, degraded water quality, and impacts to the San Joaquin River. CSPA alleges that components of the coordinated plan, adopted by multiple groundwater sustainability agencies in the region, fail to achieve sustainable groundwater management for the basin as required by the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act. CSPA’s lawsuit, filed in March 2020, seeks to declare the plan and its adoption by the agencies invalid. Groundwater in California ELF joined the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen’s Associations and the Institute for Fisheries Resources in filing a lawsuit against the State Water Resources Control Board and Siskiyou County, alleging violations of the public trust doctrine, which protects the state’s navigable waters from harm. In August 2018, the California Court of Appeal ruled that even after the enactment of the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act in 2014, these governmental entities are under an obligation to consider the possible negative effects of groundwater pumping on nearby navigable rivers. Siskiyou County sought review at the California Supreme Court, but review was denied on November 28, 2018. The Court of Appeal’s decision is now definitive law in California. Court of Appeal opinion, August 29, 2018 Press release, September 5, 2018 Transparency in Groundwater Pollution Data On March 28, 2018, ELF filed suit against the California State Water Resources Control Board, asking the court to invalidate a general permit for agriculture in the Central Valley that permits growers to keep key water quality data secret. Nitrate emitted from irrigated agriculture contaminates drinking water wells throughout the state. Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Copyright © 2021 Environmental Law Foundation.

It has members in 77 countries worldwide. Contents 1 Member organisations 2 History 3 FEE's Global Forest Fund 4 Young Reporters for the Environment 5 Programs 6 References 7 External links Member organisations[edit] FEE is an international umbrella organisation with one national member organisation per country representing FEE on the national level and in charge of implementing FEE programmes nationally. FEE has member organisations in 77 countries worldwide. When a national organisation is accepted as member of FEE it becomes “associate member of FEE”. Within 3–5 years of FEE membership, the organisation must become “full member of FEE” (which means that it has fully implemented at least two FEE programmes). Besides the national associate/full FEE member organisations, international institutions/organisations or other national organisations can also become affiliate member of FEE, and FEE does, furthermore, have some individual persons as honorary member of FEE. History[edit] The Foundation for Environmental Education was established in 1981 as the Foundation for Environmental Education in Europe (FEEE). However, at its 20th anniversary general assembly, held in Copenhagen in 2001, the organisation decided, because of growing interest from outside Europe, to become more global and dropped ""Europe"" from its name to become the Foundation for Environmental Education (FEE). The Blue Flag Programme was launched in 1985 in France. In 1987, the idea of the award scheme was presented to FEE. This year was also the European Year for the Environment initiated by the European Union, so Blue Flag was launched on the European level (10 countries) in a partnership between FEE and the European Commission. In 1987, there were only five national FEE member organisations (Italy, Spain, France, Germany and Denmark). After the launch of Blue Flag in other six European countries, FEE started to require organisations as members of FEE in order to run Blue Flag. In the late 1980s and in the beginning of the 1990s, big constitutional changes were made for FEE. In 1994, the Eco-Schools and the Young Reporters for the Environment Programmes were implemented as second and third programmes of FEE. The Learning about Forests (LEAF) programme started in 2000 and the Green Key Programme in 2003. They were already nationally existing programmes before that but were implemented these to years as FEE programmes with the use of external steering committees. In the mid-1990s a co-operation with United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), was established and a manual for coastal zone management with the example of the Blue Flag was produced. With a further support from UNEP, workshops were held in Caribbean, Africa and Asia. An interest grew rapidly in the Caribbean area and a very solid interest was shown from South Africa. In 2003, FEE signed a “Memorandum of Understanding” (MoU) with UNEP which ""formalises long-standing relationship between UNEP and FEE and provides a framework for long term co-operation on areas of common interest relating to education, training and public awareness for sustainable development globally"". This MoU provides a solid basis for furthering the work already undertaken in collaboration between FEE and UNEP, in particular with regard to the introduction of FEE programmes and associated activities, particularly in developing countries and those with economies in transition. Another MoU was signed in 2007 with the UN World Tourism Organization, where especially the tourism related programmes of FEE was recognised. FEE's Global Forest Fund[edit] As an organisation promoting sustainable development, FEE established the Global Forest Fund to offset CO2 emissions from travel. This non-profit fund invests 90% of its income directly into tree planting and other CO2 compensation efforts that are combined with environmental education activities. Young Reporters for the Environment[edit] Young Reporters for the Environment is a programme of the foundation. An international network of youth in more than 25 countries, it promotes solutions to environmental issues through investigative journalism. At the national[where?] level, participants choose local environmental issues to investigate, with the goal of communicating relevant information and solutions to the general public. The students carry out real journalistic enquiries and report their findings in the form of an article, photograph/photographic essay or video. An international competition is also held annually.[1] Programs[edit] The Foundation for Environmental Education is a non-governmental, non-profit organisation promoting sustainable development through environmental education, and is active in five programmes: Blue Flag,[2] Eco-Schools,[3] Learning about Forests (LEAF),[4] Green Key International[5] Eco-Schools.

The Great Plant HuntThe Great Plant Hunt is a five-year project supported by the Toyota Fund for Europe that ran from 2015-2020. The project educated Eco-Schools students about the importance of biodiversity, with a particular emphasis on plant species, and aimed to shape young people into advocates for conservation. The project was implemented in 16 countries and engaged students in hands-on activities to promote biodiversity in their schools and communities. Educational materials for the project were provided by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew with funding from the Wellcome Trust.To learn more about the project, visit the Eco-Schools website.   Earth Action HubThe Foundation for Environmental Education (FEE) is proud to be hosting Earth Action Hub, an international, youth-led project that aims to create a collaborative online community that will host virtual events and showcase resources that will give people the knowledge, skills, and support, needed to make sustainable choices and changes in their daily lives Donate to support Earth Action Hub Click here for details on how donations to Earth Action Hub will be used.

FEE continues to strive to create positive impact worldwide. Aligning with the Agenda 2030, FEE has identified three overarching goals that address three burning environmental problems that face us today – climate change, biodiversity loss, and environmental pollution. These are also the themes of the 2021 Global Action Days campaign. About the CampaignThe Global Action Days 2021 Campaign, in partnership with Now.Here., will engage youth through the Treasure Earth app in small positive actions (Handprints) that each one of us can take to become more compassionate towards Earth. The campaign will mobilise the power of our network and demonstrate how small individual action can have a great impact on our own and our Earth’s wellbeing. The campaign is designed as a 21-days journey of ‘Compassionate Actions’. These actions will inspire participants to live and act differently by crystallising intentions into concrete actions and new patterns of positive behaviour.Week 1 – Protect Global BiodiversityWeek 2 – Reduce Environmental PollutionWeek 3 – Empower Climate ActionLearn more about this year’s campaign on the Eco-Schools website.A message from our President, Lesley Jones“We’re delighted to be celebrating Global Actions Days and raising awareness of the positive action that is taking place around the world to create a more sustainable society.  We’re proud to work with members in 77 countries – reaching out across the globe to thousands of businesses and organisations, as well as millions of students. The commitment and innovation of those involved in FEE programmes can’t be underestimated and deserves to be showcased on the global stage.Hundreds of stories have already been shared – from students in Turkey using insects to protect forests, to a Latvian holiday park making the switch locally sourced energy.  I’d encourage everyone to make the most of this opportunity and take part in Global Action Days; promote positive action, share learning with international partners and help inspire the rest of the world.Finally, on behalf of FEE, I’d like to thank our members, partners and programme participants. Thank you for everything that you do to bring about positive change. By working together, we can ensure a sustainable world for us, our children and future generations.” Contact:Pramod Kumar Sharma Senior Education Director pramod@fee.global Global Forest FundGlobal Forest Fund is our unique scheme to help individuals like you reduce their carbon footprint while at the same time providing valuable resources and education to communities worldwide.
