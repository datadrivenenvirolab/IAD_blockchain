Unfortunately, many of us have forgotten about the importance of rivers and this has led to serious degradation in our rivers today. In Malaysia, 5% of our river basins are severely polluted and 42% are polluted, leaving only 53% of all rivers classified as ""clean"". The lack of education and awareness of the general public about our water resourves, how they are being managed, and how they should be managed is a key factor that has led to the current state of Malaysia's overall water quality. Another important factor is the lack of skill for genuinely interested people to take action in river management. GEC is committed to provide a better understanding about the importance of our rivers and appreciate the value of them. Therefore, we established a River Care Programme (RCP) focusing on promoting community participation in river and water resource protection and sustainable use through the Civic Science approach. We work closely with all stakeholders in solid waste management and water and river management, and believe that everyone has a role to play in the environment. RCP mission is to promote the protection, restoration and sustainable use of rivers by enhancing multi-stakeholder participation and knowledge to stimulate local action and vision is to have clean, healthy, living and vibrant rivers for people and the environment. Objectives of the River Care Programme are: Protect, conserve and promote living rivers and their biodiversity Promote restoration and rehabilitation of river and other water bodies. Raise awareness and educate all stakeholders about river care Promote civic consciousness and local action through river monitoring and mapping Support capacity building and networking of individuals, communities and organisations in river management The focus of this programme is to promote and support the integrated management of river basins with particular emphasis on ensuring that biodiversity and wetland conservation and community considerations are incorporated into river basin management. Project Sites Sungai Kinta Sungai Pencala Sungai Klang River Care Programme Projects GEC's River Care Programme has undertaken a range of projects and initiatives related to Integrated river basin management and has involved with various partners in the following site-based riverine assessment and management projects which emphasize community participation Mainstreaming of Biodiversity Conservation into River Management Project status: Ongoing The project aims to mainstream the biodiversity conservation into riverine landscapes through improved river planning and management practices in Malaysia.

GEI's mission was to design and implement market-based models for solving environmental problems in order to achieve development that is economically, ecologically, and socially sustainable. GEI was dissolved in October 2011. GEI's sister organization, the independent Beijing Chaoyang District Sustainable Global Environmental Institute in China (GEI-China) remains active. Contents 1 GEI-China's mission and strategy 2 Programs 3 Partners 4 GEI-Americas 5 Publications 6 References 7 External links GEI-China's mission and strategy[edit] GEI-China is an independent Chinese environmental non-profit, non-governmental organization and think tank that was established in Beijing, China in 2004. GEI-China shares GEI's mission to design and implement market-based models for solving environmental problems in order to achieve development that is economically, ecologically, and socially sustainable. GEI-China was founded on these principles and specifically aims to: Achieve self-sustaining and ecologically sound rural development by linking local communities directly with outside partners in areas such as biodiversity conservation, renewable energy, and organic agriculture. Mitigate global warming and increase energy conservation by commercializing environmental technology, fostering sustainable enterprises, and developing innovative business and financing models. Develop the capacity of leaders and civil society to design, implement, and enforce sound social and ecological development policies in both rural and urban contexts, as well as all industrial sectors in China and around the world. Integrate environmental and economic problem-solving in China by facilitating local and international collaborations between government agencies, research institutions, private enterprises, and NGOs.[1] GEI-China[1] has worked extensively in the fields of rural energy, biodiversity conservation, energy efficiency in industry and environmental governance in China.[2] In particular, it has made significant headway in spurring on unofficial, bilateral talks on climate change between the United States and China[3][4][5] (please see page 3 of the latter reference). Moreover, it has paved the way for enforcing good environmental behavior by Chinese banks as well as enterprises operating overseas, and has worked to enhance land management policies in other developing countries.[6][1] GEI-China is one of a small number of NGOs based in China, and works closely with a number of important government and academic institutions in China (including the Ministry of Environmental Protection, State Forestry Administration, Tibet Development Fund and Tsinghua University). Programs[edit] GEI-China's work falls into four main program areas: Sustainable Rural Development, Biodiversity Conservation, Energy and Climate Change and Environmental Governance. GEI-China's Sustainable Rural Development program works to incorporate successful commercial models to the development of rural communities. In particular, its projects focus clean renewable energy at the household and village level (e.g. biogas, solar cookers) as well as organic farming and rural finance. Project sites include Lijiang, Yunnan Province, the Tibet Autonomous Region and Chebaling Nature Reserve in Guangdong Province (with UNESCO) in China, as well as five provinces in Sri Lanka. The Biodiversity Conservation program at GEI-China works to spur economic development of communities living near the buffer zones of nature reserves and promoting financial models that resolve conflicts between biodiversity conservation and local economic development. GEI has worked closely with county and provincial level governments to promote the Conservation Incentive Agreements[1][7] model in the Fengtongzhai Nature Reserve in Baoxing County, Sichuan Province. In addition, the program team has worked with the Chinese government and Chinese timber enterprises in the publication and promotion of the ""Guidelines on Sustainable Overseas Silviculture by Chinese Enterprises"" (see below). GEI-China's Energy and Climate Change program works towards the development of clean energy and energy efficient enterprises through market-oriented solutions. Its work in this area has included the promotion of energy service companies (ESCos) and capacity building for Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects in China, particularly in the cement industry for energy efficiency retro-fitting. GEI-China has also provided training subsidium for Chinese enterprises under their Eco-Entrepreneurship Training Project.[8] The use of energy efficiency in China's metallurgy industry and models for the bulk procurement of energy efficient products and technology has also been actively encouraged in selected Chinese cities. In addition, GEI has worked closely with Chinese and US government institutions to promote unofficial dialogue and cooperation on climate change (see article below). Finally, GEI-China's Environmental Governance program works to provide capacity building on sustainable development for China's high-level decision makers, and to this effect it has worked closely with China's Central Communist Party School. The team also works to improve the environmental behavior of Chinese enterprises operating overseas through application of environmental tools such as Environmental Impact Assessment and payment for ecosystem services. In addition, it works closely with host countries to strengthen environmental policy. GEI is currently working with the Lao National Land Management Authority to strengthen its land management law and enforcement.[1] During the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference, Madame Jiaman Jin, Executive Director of GEI-China, said that GEI will continue to follow the climate action framework set up by the Center for Climate Strategies, placing greater emphasis on the provincial and city prefecture level in China. In addition, GEI-China will actively facilitate South-South collaboration on rural energy, particularly on technologies like biogas, solar energy and energy efficient stoves.[9] Through the years, GEI-China has worked to develop local capacity, both by supporting and incubating new NGOs and training current and future government leaders through an environmental curriculum at the Central Party School of the Chinese Communist Party.[10] Partners[edit] GEI-China has worked with a number of enterprises, government agencies and NGOs in implementing its projects. These include: National Development and Reform Commission (China) Ministry of Environmental Protection (China) State Forestry Administration (China)< Blue Moon Fund Carnegie Endowment for International Peace Rockefeller Brothers Fund Worldwatch Institute, with the regular coordination of articles for the China Watch [11] environmental news digest [1] The GEI-China Partnership Program assists international NGOs in developing environmental protection efforts in China and provides a platform for Chinese organizations and leaders to interact with and learn from environmental efforts of those outside of China. Some of these programs include: GEI-China - Innovation Center for Energy and Transportation Partnership The Innovation Center for Energy and Transportation (iCET), originally known as Auto Project on Energy and Climate Change, was launched in 2005 and aims to promote clean and energy efficient transportation technology and stringent fuel efficiency and vehicle emission regulations in China. iCET has now become an independent NGO that continues to receive financial and technical consulting from GEI. GEI-China - Green River Partnership: Three Rivers Migration Study Project In 2005, GEI-China and the Green River Environmental Protection Organization of Sichuan Province organized to implement the Three Rivers Migration Study. This partnership aims to facilitate public understanding of the regions changes, monitor government action and to develop information and recommendations to help the government improve its migration policy.[1] GEI-Americas[edit] GEI-Americas (GEI-A) constituted the Americas-based program operations of GEI. GEI-A helped local entrepreneurs in emerging countries such as Brazil, China, and Peru develop sustainable enterprises that built on American entrepreneurial values and rewarded the conservation of rural ecosystems rich in biological diversity while leveraging economic transformations that open pathways for improvements in livelihoods for rural communities local to these regions.

New from GDAE GDAE Researchers Present at Ecological Economics/Degrowth Conference July 13, 2021 GDAE Researchers presented at the Online Joint Conference of the International Society for Ecological Economics, the European Society for Ecological Economics, and the international degrowth research networks, hosted by University of Manchester, UK, 5th-8th July 2021. GDAE presentations included: Anne-Marie Codur and Sam Polzin, Farmers as Ecosystem Regenerators: A Case Study of the Northeast Healthy Soil Network. Jonathan Harris, Getting to Net Zero: Ecological Economics Can Help. Brian Roach, Jonathan Harris, and Anne-Marie Codur, Teaching Ecological Economics: Energy, Climate, Growth, and Degrowth and Changing Economics of Renewable Energy. The presentations emphasized lessons from the preparation of the fifth edition of Environmental and Natural Resource Economics: A Contemporary Approach: the increasing evidence of the severity and urgency of climate change, increased ambition for carbon reduction goals, and the essential role of renewable energy, energy efficiency, and carbon storage in soils and forests in achieving these goals. Forum on Green and Blue New Deals April 23, 2021 GDAE Senior Researcher Jonathan Harris participated in a symposium sponsored by the University of Massachusetts at Boston on Green and Blue New Deals: Science and Economics for 2021.  Noel Healy (Salem State University) and Rebecca Lewison (San Diego State University) joined Dr. Harris with presentations on policy responses to the climate emergency.  Dr. Healy’s talk was entitled “Green New Deal: Go Big or Go Home”, stressing the importance of a large-scale program with a focus on climate and economic justice. Dr. Harris’s presentation on “Getting to Net Zero Carbon Emissions: Can We Do It?” surveyed the potential of renewable energy, energy efficiency, and carbon storage in forests, grasslands, wetlands, and agricultural soils. Dr. Lewison emphasized the many ways in which healthy ocean ecosystems are key to climate stabilization. View the webinar. See Dr. Harris’s Powerpoint presentation. New Research on Ecological Farming, Restorative Forestry, and Gender Economics February 1, 2021 GDAE Researchers have new published work on important frontier areas in economics and ecology.  Senior Research Fellow Timothy A. Wise has a new article on the promise of ecological agriculture in Africa, as well as the social and ecological damage from intensive agribusiness.  See original article and other work by Wise on the promise of ecological agriculture in Africa, as well as the social and ecological damage from intensive agribusiness.  (See other recent work by Wise.) GDAE Co-Director William Moomaw is featured in a New Yorker article by Bill McKibben who cites Moomaw’s research on “proforestation”— growing existing forests intact to their ecological potential—as an alternative to unsustainable policies of burning biomass. See the original article by Moomaw et al. and a summary in EnviroBites. Senior Research Fellow Julie A. Nelson discusses issues of economics, gender, and community knowledge in two recent articles on “Economics, Considered” and “Economics and Community Knowledge-Making”. Dr. Nelson is one of the founders of feminist economics and presents feminist perspectives on the economics of care, ecological economics, behavioral economics, and the theory of the firm. Advance Chapters from New Edition of Environmental and Natural Resource Economics February 1, 2021 The fifth edition of Environmental and Natural Resource Economics: A Contemporary Approach is coming soon.  This text balances coverage of standard environmental economics topics with broader ecological economics analysis and a global perspective on current issues such as global climate change, the transition to renewable energy, “green” national income accounting, population growth, agricultural sustainability, and natural resource systems. The new edition deals with the fast-changing economics of energy and climate, as well as updating all data and presenting recent research on environmental issues. Advance Chapters on “Resources, Environment, and Economic Development” and “National Income and Environmental Accounting” can be substituted for corresponding chapters in the current text; other advance chapters on energy and climate change will be available soon. Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office Forum on Forest Carbon Storage September 15, 2020 GDAE Co-Director Dr. William Moomaw joined two distinguished colleagues, Richard A. Birdsey of the Woodwell Climate Research Center and John Sterman of the MIT Sloan School of Management at a forum sponsored by the Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office to discuss The Critical Role of Forests in Protecting Climate and Public Health. In addition to examining the crucial role of forests in carbon storage, the panelists discuss the potential of energy efficiency and renewables, concluding that an aggressive policy combining efficiency and renewables with forest protection and expansion can be effective in reducing the impacts of climate change. View the webinar. Climate Change, Social Equity, and the Green New Deal August 14, 2020 GDAE Senior Researcher Jonathan Harris is quoted extensively in a new article on social equity and the Green New Deal.  He argues that the political presentation of the Green New Deal has improved, stressing its practical advantages especially for low-income earners.  A Green New Deal has the potential to create millions of jobs, while employing policy measures that are low cost and can have immediate impact.  The COVID crisis increases the urgency of a broad Federal response both to unemployment and to the health crisis.  The article builds on an earlier presentation about Transitioning to a Low-Carbon Economy.  See also Harris’s policy brief on Ecological Economics of the Green New Deal and other research by GDAE on Green Economics. Two New Policy Briefs on Soils and Climate July 13, 2020 Policies to promote healthy soils are central both for climate policy and agricultural sustainability. Following two conferences on the topic, GDAE researchers present two policy briefs, one by Sam Polzin on Soil Carbon, Water Management, and Natural Infrastructure and one by Benjamin Johnson on Land Value and Soil Quality.  They advocate: Regionally coordinated state-level agricultural policy incentives to enhance both soil health and water management in the Northeastern United States by harnessing the potential for agriculture to build natural infrastructure. Reforming current systems of land valuation and taxation to reflect soil quality and long-term productive potential, creating landowner incentives for proper stewardship. See Healthy Soils conference reports and other related climate policy briefs. Moomaw Appeals to the EU Parliament for Climate-Focused Forest Management May 22, 2020 GDAE Co-director William Moomaw has drafted a letter to the European Parliament emphasizing forest management as an effective tool to reduce atmospheric carbon.  Forests remove more carbon from the atmosphere than any other planetary system, but this storage potential is threatened by human activities. Long-term carbon storage in forests is critically important in order to achieve both EU and global climate targets. The letter has been signed by 370 scientists from 34 countries who have a range of expertise spanning multiple dimensions of climate, forests, energy, carbon cycle accounting and biodiversity. Signers include some of the senior scientists who warned about the consequences of climate change during the 1970s and 80s, leading scientists of today, and younger scientists who are studying to be able to offer their talents to nature’s climate solutions. GDAE Co-Director Sponsors Letter Urging Congress to Protect Forests May 13, 2020 GDAE Co-Director Dr. William Moomaw has sponsored a letter urging Congress to protect forests in the United States and shift away from wood consumption in an effort to reduce carbon emissions.  The letter has been signed by more than 200 climate and forest scientists. The letter is further discussed here. Transitioning to a Low-Carbon Economy May 12, 2020 GDAE research is extensively cited in a new article on the Green New Deal and the transition to a low-carbon economy. The article argues that a Green New Deal can produce both environmental and economic benefits and quotes extensively from GDAE researcher Jonathan Harris. See also Harris’s related Climate Policy Brief. Responding to Climate Change in Japan March 31, 2020 GDAE Visiting Scholar David Sussman writes that climate change is threatening important cultural aspects of Japanese life, yet most people in the country have not taken actions to limit their carbon emissions. In this op-ed in the Nikkei Asian Review, Dr. Sussman calls for individual and systemic changes that will reduce wasteful consumption and fossil fuel dependence. The Northeast Healthy Soil Network Hosts Symposium February 21, 2020 This day-long symposium brought together policymakers, farmers, academics, and students with the goal of advancing healthy soils policies and practices throughout the northeast. For more about the event and event materials, visit the 2020 Conferences Page. Moomaw speaks at Unite Behind the Science event hosted by Greta Thunberg and Luisa Neubauer during COP25 December 10, 2019 GDAE Co-director Dr. William Moomaw, co-author of the recent World Scientists’ Warning of a Climate Emergency, joins fellow scientist Youba Sokona, youth activists Greta Thunberg and Luisa Neubauer, and scientists Ko Barrett, Sivan Kartha, and Rachel Cleetus, on the stage at the United Nations COP25 climate conference in Madrid. Read more about the event. World Scientists’ Warning of a Climate Emergency November 5, 2019 William Moomaw co-authored a paper published in the journal BioScience. In the paper, Moomaw and his co-authors declared a climate emergency that without deep and lasting shifts in human activities will result in “untold human suffering”. The authors present a suite of graphical vital signs of climate change over the last 40 years for human activities that can affect GHG emissions and change the climate, as well as actual climatic impacts. The paper is endorsed by 11,258 scientists from 153 countries. The paper has been covered by The Washington Post, The Guardian, The Boston Globe, and USA Today. Rome Summit Takes Bold Step Toward Agroecology October 24, 2019 Common Dreams published an article by Timothy A. Wise on agroecology and its role as one of the cutting-edge innovations we need to help small-scale farmers adapt to climate change. Why Keeping Mature Forests Intact Is Key to the Climate Fight October 15, 2019 GDAE Co-Director Dr. William Moomaw was interviewed by Yale Environment 360 about the importance of existing forests and why the push to cut them for fuel to generate electricity is misguided. GDAE Researchers Present at Ecological Economics Conference August 2019 Three GDAE researchers presented papers at the Ecological Society of America/United States Society for Ecological Economics conference on August 11-16, 2019 in Louisville, Kentucky, on the theme “Bridging Communities & Ecosystems: Inclusion as an Ecological Imperative”.

To do this we challenge power, catalyse action and empower people to achieve positive change. Food production is the single greatest impact humans have on the environment. From mountains of food waste, to habitat destruction to clear land to grow animal feed for factory farms, to soil depletion leaving future harvests at risk: the food system needs to change. Founded in 2013, we combine hard-hitting investigative research, mass public participation feasts,  and on the ground pilots for a better food system. As a result, we’ve put food issues, in particular waste, at the very top of the business and policy agendas. Read more about our impact. A more sustainable food system? Our food system is dysfunctional: using too many limited natural resources, and producing too much waste and pollution. But we believe we can secure nutritious and delicious food for everyone, without trashing our planet. Read about our model for a sustainable food system. We work across multiple aspects of our food system, including industrial meat, food waste, farmed fish, British sugar and ‘green’ energy generated through Anaerobic Digestion of edible food. We also work on campaigns around food citizenship, food commons and new food economies, piloting alternatives to the globalised, financialised food system. Find out more about our programmes of work. You can also read our 2018-19 report here. How we work To move towards a food system that nourishes both people and our planet will require significant changes to our food culture, the food economy and its governance. We are seeking to bring about these changes through a unique combination of campaigning and advocacy, citizen engagement and pilot programmes. We expose systemic problems that have led to unsustainable use of resources within the food system. We act as a critical friend to industry and policy makers or, when more appropriate, we launch creative campaigns to achieve the changes that we seek (for example our campaigns Total Bull and our supermarket food waste scorecard). We build coalitions with other civil society groups, mobilising activists around our agenda. Free public feasts are a key way in which we support the growth of diverse movements of citizens on food issues. We also use volunteering as a further opportunity for the public to ‘be the change’ and have a comprehensive youth engagement and food system education programme. We are proud of our ability to reach people from all walks of life, including those for whom engagement with our work is their first foray into environmental and food system activism, for example through our Gleaning Network. When solutions cannot be achieved with changes to current organisations, models and practices, we roll up our sleeves and pilot alternatives – be it through gleaning or anchoring new community food economies. Through these pilots, we demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of a new food economy, and enable replication of our success around the globe through training, toolkits and engaging with citizens, civil society allies and change makers far and wide.

Go Gleaning Intro Take Action About Join us in the fields - it’s time to get your hands dirty! Feedback’s Gleaning Network gives volunteers all over the country an opportunity to engage with the food system hands-on by rescuing fresh, surplus fruit and veg from farms where it would otherwise be wasted, and get it to good causes. In doing so we are bringing an age-old practice to avoid waste, gleaning, into the 21st century. What's the problem? Feedback’s research has found that farmers waste around 16% of their crop before it even leaves the field or barn – often due to factors beyond their control, such as produce not being the right shape or size for supermarket tastes, or inaccurate forecasting by retailers of how much produce they will buy, leaving farmers with excess crop on their hands. Read more about our research on supply chain food waste. Untitled-3 What's the solution? Since 2012, Feedback’s Gleaning Network has worked with 60 farmers, 3,000 volunteers and numerous charities to rescue over 500 tonnes of fruits and vegetables that would otherwise be wasted. In 2019, we decided the time was right to expand this network further, by training and supporting community groups across the country to run gleaning activities in their region. Our vision is for a sustainable future where food waste no longer exists; in the meantime, wherever and whenever a farmer has surplus produce, a well-trained local gleaning group can help ensure this food reaches good causes. Our new Gleaning Network website contains a map to help farmers and volunteers find their nearest gleaning group, and a toolkit for use by existing and new gleaning groups. We’re constantly exploring new ideas for how we can further expand, develop and strengthen The Gleaning Network, and how we can continue the fight against food waste. We’re always open to offers of support.

Guess the Date Contest Classroom Activities Footprint Calculator Ecological Footprint Book Subscribe Donate Past Earth Overshoot Days To determine the date of Earth Overshoot Day for each year, Global Footprint Network calculates the number of days of that year that Earth’s biocapacity suffices to provide for humanity’s Ecological Footprint. The remainder of the year corresponds to global overshoot. Earth Overshoot Day is computed by dividing the planet’s biocapacity (the amount of ecological resources Earth is able to generate that year), by humanity’s Ecological Footprint (humanity’s demand for that year), and multiplying by 365, the number of days in a year: (Planet’s Biocapacity / Humanity’s Ecological Footprint) x 365 = Earth Overshoot Day Global Ecological Footprint and biocapacity metrics are calculated each year in the National Footprint and Biocapacity Accounts. Using UN statistics, these accounts incorporate the latest data and the most updated accounting methodology (the National Footprint and Biocapacity Accounts 2021 Edition feature 2017 data.) To estimate this year’s Earth Overshoot Day, Ecological Footprint and biocapacity are “nowcasted” to the current year using the latest data from additional sources, such as the Global Carbon Project. To maintain consistency with the latest reported data and science, the Ecological Footprint metrics for all past years since 1961 (the earliest year data is available) are recalculated every year, so each year’s metrics share a common data set and the exact same accounting method. The annual dates of Earth Overshoot Day are recalculated accordingly. Consequently, it is inaccurate to simply look at media accounts from previous years to determine past Earth Overshoot Days. Indeed, a true apples-to-apples comparison of Earth Overshoot Days can only be made using the same edition of the National Footprint and Biocapacity Accounts. For instance, it would make no sense to compare the date of Earth Overshoot Day 2007 as it was calculated that year—and reported by the media at the time—with the date of Earth Overshoot Day 2020, because improved historical data and new findings such as lower net carbon sequestration by forests have slightly shifted the results. Even a few percentage points change can shift the date of Earth Overshoot Day by a good number of days. This is why, ultimately, the precise Earth Overshoot Day date for each year is less significant than the sheer magnitude of the ecological overshoot, as well as the overall trend of the date progression year over year—which, as you now understand, is rigorously identical to that of the Ecological Footprint (given the fact that biocapacity remains basically unchanged.) Over the last decades, the date has been creeping up the calendar every year, although at a slowing rate. The dates of past Earth Overshoot Days, as calculated with the National Footprint and Biocapacity Accounts 2021 Edition, are: Français December 30, 1970 December 20, 1971 December 10, 1972 November 26, 1973 November 27, 1974 November 30, 1975 November 17, 1976 November 11, 1977 November 7, 1978 October 29, 1979 November 4, 1980 November 11, 1981 November 15, 1982 November 14, 1983 November 7, 1984 November 4, 1985 October 30, 1986 October 23, 1987 October 14, 1988 October 11, 1989 October 10, 1990 October 9, 1991 October 11, 1992 October 11, 1993 October 9, 1994 October 3, 1995 September 30, 1996 September 28, 1997 September 28, 1998 September 28, 1999 September 22, 2000 September 21, 2001 September 18, 2002 September 8, 2003 August 30, 2004 August 24, 2005 August 18, 2006 August 13, 2007 August 13, 2008 August 16, 2009 August 6, 2010 August 3, 2011 August 2, 2012 August 1, 2013 August 2, 2014 August 3, 2015 August 3, 2016 July 30, 2017 July 25, 2018 July 26, 2019 August 22, 2020* July 29, 2021 *The calculation of Earth Overshoot Day 2020 reflects the initial drop in resource use in the first half of the year due to pandemic-induced lockdowns. All other years assume a constant rate of resource use throughout the year. Donate today to help #MoveTheDate of Earth Overshoot Day.

It was established as a charitable not-for-profit organization in each of those three countries. Global Footprint Network develops and promotes tools for advancing sustainability, including the ecological footprint and biocapacity, which measure the amount of resources we use and how much we have. These tools aim at bringing ecological limits to the center of decision-making. Contents 1 Work 1.1 National Footprint and Biocapacity Accounts 1.2 Ecological Footprint Explorer 2 Earth Overshoot Day 3 Founding 4 Leadership 5 Awards/Honours 6 See also 7 References and further reading 8 External links Work[edit] Global Footprint Network's goal is to create a future where all humans can live well, within the means of one planet Earth. The organization is headquartered in Oakland, California. The Network brings together over 70 partner organizations,[2] including WWF International, ICLEI, Bank Sarasin, The Pictet Group, the New Economics Foundation, Pronatura México, and the Environment Agency Abu Dhabi. National Footprint and Biocapacity Accounts[edit] Every year, Global Footprint Network produced a new edition[3] of its National Footprint and Biocapacity Accounts, which calculate Ecological Footprint and biocapacity of more than 200 countries and territories from 1961 to the present. Based on up to 15,000 data points per country per year, these data have been used to influence policy in more than a dozen countries, including Ecuador, France, Germany, Japan, Korea, the Philippines, Russia, Switzerland, and the United Arab Emirates. Since 2019, the National Footprint and Biocapacity Accounts are produced in collaboration between Global Footprint Network, York University,[4] and Footprint Data Foundation.[5] The 2021 Edition of the National Footprint Accounts cover 1961-2017 (latest UN data available), and incorporate data from the Food and Agriculture Organization, the UN Comtrade database, the International Energy Agency, and over 20 other sources.[6][7] Ecological Footprint Explorer[edit] In April 2017, Global Footprint Network launched the Ecological Footprint Explorer,[8] an open data platform for the National Footprint Accounts.[9][10] The website provides ecological footprint results for over 200 countries and territories, and encourages researchers, analysts, and decision-makers to visualize and download data. Earth Overshoot Day[edit] Previously known as Ecological Debt Day, Earth Overshoot Day is the day when humanity has exhausted nature's budget for the year. For the rest of the year, society operates in ecological overshoot by drawing down local resource stocks and accumulating carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The first Earth Overshoot Day was December 19, 1987.[11] In 2014, Earth Overshoot Day was August 19.[12] The Earth Overshoot Day in 2015 was on August 13[13] and on August 8 in 2016.[14] In 2017, Earth Overshoot Day landed on August 2, and in 2020 on August 22. Founding[edit] In 2003, Mathis Wackernagel, PhD, and Susan Burns founded Global Footprint Network, an international think-tank headquartered in Oakland, California, with offices in Geneva and Brussels. Wackernagel received an honorary doctorate in December 2007 from the University of Bern in Switzerland.

This includes: Bioenergy generation and BECCS/geoengineering to meet renewable energy targets; Climate mitigation approaches centred around afforestation and reforestation with tree plantations, forest carbon offsets and other market-based schemes; Public subsidies and climate finance that are increasingly being directed towards commercial tree plantations and bioenergy generation with strong private sector involvement. These three key areas of work tie together the vital struggles that our member groups are engaged in locally with national and international-level advocacy that we engage in with our allies as a coalition, particularly concerning the UNFCCC, international climate finance mechanisms, global campaigns against the expansion of industrial bioenergy and genetically engineered trees. We also campaign for gender justice as a key pillar of climate justice, and promote gender-responsive and community-led alternative solutions to the climate and biodiversity crises.

The three primary targets of the coalition are the United Nations Forum on Forests, the Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Convention on Biological Diversity.[10] Forest Working Group[edit] The Forest Working Group was an informal network of 15-20 NGOs established in 1995, predating the Global Forest Coalition. It included NGOs from all regions that participated in international forest policy meetings and organized joint advocacy campaigns on issues such as indigenous peoples’ rights, socially-just forest policy, and underlying causes of forest loss.

Ils se trouvaient dans l'État australien de Tasmanie (le United Tasmania Group ) et en Nouvelle-Zélande (le Values ​​Party ). D'autres ont suivi rapidement : en 1973, PEOPLE (plus tard le Parti écologique) a été créé au Royaume-Uni, et dans d'autres pays européens, des partis verts et radicaux ont vu le jour dans les années suivantes. Petra Kelly , une militante écoféministe allemande, est souvent citée comme l'une des premières penseuses et leaders du mouvement de la politique verte . Son travail dans la fondation du Parti vert allemand en Allemagne de l'Ouest en 1980 a contribué à donner de l'importance aux partis politiques verts sur les scènes nationale et internationale. La première réunion planétaire des Verts s'est tenue à Rio de Janeiro les 30 et 31 mai 1992, parallèlement au Sommet de la Terre de Rio qui se tenait simultanément au Brésil. C'est ici que la toute première déclaration des Verts mondiaux a été publiée, en commençant par cette préface : Petra Kelly, une écoféministe allemande et penseuse de la politique verte qui a fondé le Parti vert allemand en 1980 ""L'expérience nous enseigne que les gouvernements ne sont amenés à prendre les problèmes environnementaux au sérieux que lorsque les gens votent pour des partis politiques environnementaux."" Le premier Congrès mondial des Verts s'est tenu à Canberra, en Australie, en 2001. La Charte officielle des Verts mondiaux a été publiée ici et les délégués au Congrès ont mis en place le cadre et les structures organisationnelles qui allaient faire des Verts mondiaux un réseau et un mouvement internationaux permanents, y compris le Coordination mondiale des Verts. En 2010, le premier secrétaire Global Greens a été nommé. Charte mondiale des verts La Charte mondiale des Verts est le document d'orientation qui établit les principes et les « valeurs fondamentales » auxquels les partis membres et les organisations associées doivent tenter d'adhérer. Il énonce des principes mondiaux qui transcendent les frontières pour unir les Verts du monde entier : Démocratie participative La non-violence Justice sociale Durabilité Respect de la diversité Sagesse écologique Les priorités décrites dans la Charte comprennent la réforme du modèle économique dominant, la lutte contre le changement climatique, la fin de la crise alimentaire, la promotion d'une démocratie dynamique, le travail pour la paix, la protection de la biodiversité. La Charte Global Greens a été révisée et mise à jour à deux reprises lors des Congrès Global Greens depuis sa publication initiale en 2001 : une fois à Dakar, au Sénégal en 2012, et à nouveau à Liverpool, au Royaume-Uni, en 2017. La version mise à jour de 2017 est proposée en anglais, et les versions sont accessibles en 11 langues différentes.

It consists of various national Green political parties, partner networks, and other organizations associated with green politics. Formed in 2001 at the First Global Greens Congress, the network has grown to include 80 full member parties and 18 observers and associate parties as of February 2019.[2] It is governed by a 12-member steering committee called the Global Greens Coordination, and each member party falls under the umbrella of one of four affiliated regional green federations. The day-to-day operations of the Global Greens are managed by the Secretariat, led by Global Greens Convenors Bob Hale and Gloria Polanco since 2020.

These were in the Australian state of Tasmania (the United Tasmania Group) and in New Zealand (the Values Party). Others followed quickly: in 1973, PEOPLE (later the Ecology Party) was set up in the UK, and in other European countries Green and radical parties sprang up in the following years.[3] Petra Kelly, a German ecofeminist activist, is often cited as one of the first thinkers and leaders of the green politics movement. Her work in founding the German Green Party in West Germany in 1980 was instrumental in bringing prominence to green political parties on both the national and international stages. The first Planetary Meeting of the Greens was held in Rio de Janeiro on May 30–31, 1992 in conjunction with the Rio Earth Summit being concurrently held in Brazil.[4] It was here that the first ever Global Greens statement was issued, beginning with this preface: Petra Kelly, a German ecofeminist and green politics thinker who founded the German Green Party in 1980 ""Experience teaches us that governments are only moved to take environmental problems seriously when people vote for environmental political parties.""[5] The first Global Greens Congress was held in Canberra, Australia, in 2001. The official Global Greens Charter was issued here and the Congress delegates set up the framework and organizational structures that would build the Global Greens into an ongoing international network and movement, including the Global Greens Coordination. In 2010, the first Global Greens Secretary was appointed.[3] Global Greens Charter[edit] The Global Greens Charter is the guiding document that establishes the principles and ""core values"" to which member parties and associated organizations should attempt to adhere.[6] It sets out global principles that cross boundaries to bind Greens from around the world together: Participatory Democracy Nonviolence Social Justice Sustainability Respect for Diversity Ecological Wisdom Priorities outlined in the Charter include reforming the dominant economic model, tackling climate change, ending the hunger crisis, promoting vibrant democracy, working for peace, protecting biodiversity. The Global Greens Charter has been reviewed and updated twice during Global Greens Congresses since its original publishing in 2001: once in Dakar, Senegal in 2012, and again in Liverpool, U.K., in 2017. The updated 2017 version is offered in English, and past versions can be accessed in 11 various languages.[7] Regional Federations of the Global Greens[edit] The Global Greens are organized into four regional federations across the world: Asia Pacific Greens Federation European Green Party Federation of Green Parties of Africa Federation of the Green Parties of the Americas Global Greens Coordination[edit] The Global Greens has a 12-member steering committee called the Global Greens Coordination.[8] The makeup of this committee stems from three elected members from each of the four regional federations, supported by three alternates who can stand in when needed. Global Greens Congress[edit] The Global Greens have held four Congresses since 2001 in various locations around the world: 2001 - Canberra, Australia 2008 - São Paulo, Brazil 2012 - Dakar, Senegal 2017 - Liverpool, U.K.[9] The Global Greens strives to achieve regional diversity and representation, encouraging Congress locations to represent the wide geographical spread of the organization's member parties and organizations. The next Global Greens Congress will be held in 2023. It will be hosted by the Green Party Korea in Seoul.[10] Networks[edit] Federation of Young European Greens demonstration in Copenhagen, during the Climate Summit 2009. The Global Greens have five networks designed to enable global collaboration, communication and community among member parties and organizations: Friends of Global Greens This network is composed of Green parties, parliamentarians and activists who make recurring donations of any amount to the Global Greens.[11] Global Greens LGBT+ Network This network aims to: ""Support LGBT+ groups within Green Parties around the world to work together and support each other; Support Green Parties looking to set-up LGBT+ groups, and; Promote LGBT+ equality as outlined in the Global Greens Charter.""[12] Global Greens Parliamentarians Network This network is composed of Green Members of Parliament from Global Greens member parties and works to fulfill the following objectives: ""To be active, in a coordinated manner, in our parliaments on issues of identified global concern, in order to influence the governments of our countries, and the public whom we represent, to the goals specifically identified by the Global Greens; To develop a mutually-reinforcing and mutually-supportive network of MPs, as individuals, to help us each to become most effective in our parliamentary action, and realise our potential as movers of positive global change, and; To achieve positive change for Green goals at the global and regional levels through the strengthening of international institutions, including more parliamentarian representation and decision-making influence in those bodies.""[13] Global Greens Women's Network This network supports the participation of Green women worldwide in democratic political processes, by focusing on: ""Capacity building and empowerment: training and developing skills, such as public speaking and leadership; Governance and participation: confronting inequalities at the organizational level and exchanging best practices to tackle them and promote participation; Campaigning about major topics relevant to women: such as gender justice and climate change, and; Carrying out formal functions as part of global Greens governance: e.g. nominating women to the Asia-Pacific Greens Federation (APGF) Council.""[14] Global Young Greens This network is a ""youth-led organization supporting and uniting the efforts of young people from a green-alternative spectrum around the world. It works towards (1) ecological sustainability, (2) social justice, (3) grassroots democracy and (4) peace.""[15] Global Greens Ambassadors[edit] The Global Greens Coordination appointed Christine Milne AO as the first Global Greens Ambassador in 2015. Milne was appointed as Global Greens Ambassador in recognition of her considerable expertise in climate change and as an elected member of state and federal parliaments, including as Leader of the Australian Greens.

GJEP envisions a world in which all societies are justly and equitably governed with full participation by an engaged and informed populace living in harmony with the natural world and one another. We accomplish our mission by (1) prioritizing campaigns that are key leverage points for advancing systemic change, and (2) linking struggles and strengthening diverse movements with strategic action, information, and analysis. Philosophy of Activism Maintain an uncompromising stance and keep the bar high. Make systemic connections through a holistic analysis. Build strong bonds of trust with Indigenous Peoples and their organizations. Be accountable to grassroots organizations and communities. Use direct action as a strategic tool. Be efficient and effective. Win. Principles We believe in the fundamental equality of all peoples and the intrinsic value of the natural world. Our program work is guided by these principles: Confronting oppression, challenging power elites, and amplifying the voice of the least powerful among us. Championing diversity and equal rights to break down barriers and open doors to common goals and ideas. Working in cooperation, not competition, to build grassroots power. Our Programs No Genetically Engineered Trees: We use the cross-cutting issue of GE trees to support and build power on related issues ranging from the rights and autonomy of Indigenous Peoples, forest restoration, to challenging false solutions to climate change such as bioenergy from GE trees. Strategic Media: We strategically use mainstream and alternative media to expose the root causes of social and ecological injustice.  We amplify the voices of front line communities fighting the impacts of climate change, the fossil fuels industry and land grabs linked to false solutions to climate change such as industrial biofuels. We partner with Margaret Prescod’s Sojourner Truth show on KPFK Pacifica Radio (Los Angeles) since November 2009, producing weekly “Earth Segments,” as well as weekly interviews on important environmental news.  We also host a New Voices on Climate Change speakers Bureau, and support allies through social media and email campaigns. Langelle Photography uses the power of photojournalism to expose social and ecological injustice. The point of Langelle Photography is to place photographs into the context of social struggle—the struggle for societal transformation toward justice, equity and ecological balance. History Anne Petermann and Orin Langelle, activists with decades of experience in the environmental and social justice movements, on local, national and international fronts, founded GJEP in 2003. They saw the need for a project grounded in understanding that environmental degradation, war, the destruction of civil rights and liberties, and economic and social injustice were not isolated, and needed to be addressed at their common root causes. Key Accomplishments Stop GE Trees Campaign: Created and led a major international campaign against GE trees, which has so far successfully prevented their large-scale commercial release Organized historic week of action at the international Tree Biotechnology 2013 conference in Asheville, NC in May 2013–including several arrests and the largest ever protest against GE trees Won a decision from the UN Convention on Biological Diversity warning countries of the social and ecological dangers of GE trees Assembled a legal team to challenge USDA approval of GE eucalyptus trees,which is discouraging investment and prevented GE tree company ArborGen from going public on the NASDAQ in April 2011, leading to the replacement of its executive staff in January 2012 Consulted on the creation of an award-winning documentary “A Silent Forest:The Growing Threat, Genetically Engineered Trees,” narrated by internationally renowned geneticist Dr. David Suzuki. Brought major media attention to the dangers of GE trees, including a front-page story in the Washington Post, and articles/features in the New York Times, Bloomberg News, Christian Science Monitor, Charlotte Observer, Memphis Appeal, NPR’s Living on Earth program, and Jim Hightower Radio, among numerous others Cited frequently by industry leaders as a major obstacle to GE tree research and development Strategic Media and Communications: Worked directly with media to amplify the voices of impacted communities, social movements, grassroots groups and networks.  Since 2004 we traveled to the UN and other international forums, including the Climate Convention, the Biodiversity Convention, the UN Forum on Indigenous Issues and the World Social Forum where we succeeded in featuring these voices in hundreds of newswires and media outlets around the world, reaching millions of people with their messages. Produced the DVD “A Darker Shade of Green,” in 2012 to showcase Indigenous Peoples’ resistance to REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation). The DVD is available in English, Spanish and Portuguese. Used the power of photojournalism to expose injustice and help prevent the forced relocation of Amador Hernandez, an Indigenous community in the Lacandon Jungle of Chiapas, Mexico in 2011. Climate Justice and Indigenous Peoples’ Rights: Co-founded Durban Group for Climate Justice in 2004; Climate Justice Now! in 2007. Co-founded Climate Justice Action in 2008, which organized the historicPeoples’ Assembly and Reclaim Power march out at the 2009 UN Climate Conference in Copenhagen. Used writing, analysis and direct action to expose the extent of corporate influences on UN climate and biodiversity negotiations. Highlighted the exclusion of Indigenous Peoples, social movements and other stakeholders from UN decision-making.

Since 2005 GLOBE has been running a climate change dialogue for legislators from all major political parties and from the sixteen major economies (Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, S.Korea, S.Africa, USA , UK and European Parliament) to examine the science, economics and to identify the possible policy responses. That dialogue has enjoyed engagement with perspectives from all sides of the political spectrum and with both so-called sceptics and advocates alike. The aim of the dialogue has been to provide a political space, away from the formal UN negotiations, where national positions can be explored and common ground identified. GLOBE has worked closely with major economy governments, the World Bank and the United Nations to that effect. GLOBE's process is open and transparent and the media has been invited to cover all of GLOBEs Legislators Forums. For example, at the most recent GLOBE Legislators Forum in Copenhagen in October 2009, which involved over 120 legislators from 16 countries, the discussions were covered by Reuters, IPS, BBC, PA, Danish TV and radio - TV2 and DR1, BBC Newsnight and by journalists attending from Brazil, China, India, Mexico and South Africa. All GLOBEs policy positions are openly available on our website. GLOBE refutes absolutely the allegations made by some ill-informed elements of the media about the aims of the organisation. Adam C.T.

GLOBE's objective is to support political leadership on issues of climate and energy security, land use change and ecosystems. Internationally, GLOBE is focused on leadership from G20 leaders and the leaders of the emerging economies as well as formal negotiations within the United Nations. GLOBE believes that legislators have a critical role to play in holding their own governments to account for the commitments that are made during international negotiations. History[edit] Since 2005 and following the invitation of the former UK Prime Minister, Tony Blair, GLOBE has brought together one hundred legislators from all major political parties within the parliaments of the G8, European Parliament, Brazil, China, India, Mexico & South Africa. GLOBE has convened this group twice a year in a series of focussed policy dialogues held in the US Senate, German Bundestag (2007), Brazilian Senate, Japanese Diet, Mexican Congress (2008) UK House of Commons, Italian Chamber of Deputies, and most recently in the Danish Parliament, the Folketing (2009). The dialogues have included participation by President [Luis Inacio Lula] of Brazil, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, then Prime Minister Tony Blair of the UK, then Prime Ministers Fukuda, and Abe of Japan and the Danish Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen. In addition, both 2008 U.S. Presidential candidates addressed the GLOBE Forum in Tokyo on 28 June 2008. During COP15 in Copenhagen in December 2009, UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown presented Mexican President Calderon with the GLOBE Award for International Leadership on the MONKEY. Between the two annual meetings smaller groups of legislators were convened in working groups and in two International Commissions on Climate & Energy Security chaired by US Congressman Ed Markey, and on Land Use Change & Ecosystems chaired by former World Bank Vice President, Mr Ian Johnson.

Composed of a network of more than 5000 supporters from all levels of society, brought together from politics, economics and civil society, the Initiative is based on five core goals for fair globalization. Through its network-like character, it is organized through even hierarchies and without a centre. Everyone is invited to actively participate and take action with their circles and the accompanying opportunities to implement a World in Balance. The goal of the Global Marshall Plan Initiative is to establish a framework compatible with sustainability for the global economy – a global Eco-Social Market Economy. Contents 1 Origins 2 Self-understanding 3 Goals 4 The logic of the plan 5 Key requirements for a world in balance 5.1 Further development and implementation of the UN Millennium Development Goals 5.2 Achieving the 0.7% target and raising an additional necessary funds 5.3 Fair taxation on the global value-added processes 5.3.1 Financial transactions tax 5.3.2 Other considerations 5.4 Fair, global partnerships and effective appropriation of funds 5.4.1 From development aid to development cooperation 5.4.2 Application of funds 5.5 Framework compatible with sustainability for the global economy: a global Eco-Social Market Economy 6 Next stages 6.1 Supporters 7 On a local level 8 Literature 9 External links 10 References Origins[edit] Al Gore - Author of ""Earth in the Balance: Ecology and the Human Spirit"" The idea of a Global Marshall Plan was first published in 1990 by U.S. politician, entrepreneur and environmentalist Al Gore in his book “Earth in the Balance: Ecology and the Human Spirit”. The choice of name deliberately recalls the historical Marshall Plan after the Second World War (officially: European Recovery Program), a symbol for hope, solidarity and peace. The idea of a Global Marshall Plan was not new but had already been endorsed in the 1990s by personalities from a variety of sectors: Kofi Annan, Al Gore, Hans Küng, Susan George, Mikhail Gorbachov, His Royal Highness Prince El Hassan bin Talal of Jordan, George Soros, Lutz Wicke, Georg Winter and many others (Global Contract). As early as the beginning of the 1990s an ecological Marshall Plan was established by prominent personalities such as journalist Franz Alt and German Green politician Joscka Fisher. Along with many other supporters, they called for the establishment of an eco-social market economy, 100 billion DM put towards the environment every year and a kerosene tax. As the world increasingly finds itself in a difficult, unsustainable situation as a result of rapid globalization, both in terms of environmental issues, poverty and unequal distribution, as well as the disproportionate cultural balance, on 16 May 2003 representatives from 16 civil society organizations revived the original idea for a global Marshall Plan as a movement for world peace, sustainability and justice, and at the Frankfurt airport, the Global Marshall Plan initiative was launched. Since the initiative should be organized as a network, i.e. locally and without hierarchies, the coordination of tasks and activities was assigned to different people and institutions: the coordination of content was taken up by Prof. Dr. Franz-Josef Radermacher as Head of FAW/n, politicians, and Josef Riegler, with particular importance on an EU level and the Eco-Social Forum Europe. The coordination, initiation and promotion of supporters’ activities internationally were assigned the Global Contract Foundation and Frithjof Finkbeiner. Due to the enormous positive response and the wide range of activities, this commission was soon transferred to the Global Marshall Plan Foundation. The long-term goal of the initiative is to establish a global eco-social market economy and alter the current failing global framework to lead to long-lasting peace and sustainability. From the beginning, the founders set themselves the goal of developing the initiative as openly as possible and also of winning over the support of the economy. All actors and parts of the global society should find that in the Global Marshall Plan one-sided organization can constructively be prevented. The initiative aims to provide the greatest possible support to the world to ensure that the plan is continually developed in its substance, quality, implementation and coverage. In a series of lectures in 2003–4, the initiative was refined further. Eventually the first report on the Global Marshall Plan Initiative (“Global Marshall Plan – A Planetary Contract for a global Eco-Social Market Economy) was compiled. It was published in September 2004. In the meantime, more and more members of the European Parliament and national parliaments began to back the initiative. Soon organizations from the civil society and the economy followed, as well as the first university. The initiative has been received very well internationally and has grown into a network made up of over 5000 individual supporters, organizations as well as numerous federal states and communities. Believing that change will come from the centre of society, supporters raise awareness of the issues surrounding globalization and motivate those around them for the implementation of fair globalization. Lectures are an essential part of spreading the word. By raising awareness and informing, alliances are formed and pressure is created from “bottom-up”. Those motivated are trained through multiplier training in Global Marshall Plan Academies. Self-understanding[edit] The material prosperity of mankind has never before experienced such an increase. Nevertheless poverty, deprivation and the resulting illnesses are still alarmingly widespread. The increasing overexploitation of nature, the waste of limited resources and the expected catastrophic climate consequences linked to pollution will in the next 30 years present mankind with its biggest challenge yet. The unsustainable consumption of developing countries, poverty and population growth are among the key problems. Many hundreds of millions of people do not benefit from the positive effects of ongoing globalization. this has further increased the income gap between rich industrial nations and the poorest developing countries. The spread of AIDS and looming population growth also accelerate this gap. Any effort to overcome this unsustainable development will be four times more difficult in the future, or even impossible, if a fundamental turnaround is not set in place soon. The Global Marshall Plan Initiative wants to strengthen these turnarounds. With the self-understanding of a network-style movement for a World in Balance, positively aligned powers from politics, economics, science and civil society are brought together in a wide-ranging alliance based on the key requirements of fair globalization. This relies on the simultaneous pursuit of “bottom-up” and “top-down” approach, thus raising awareness and increasing lobbying. Through lectures, information events and publications, more people and groups are continually informed about the absolute necessity and the possibility of a global Eco-Social framework, so that political change comes from the centre of society. At the same time, support for the Global Marshall Plan and a global Eco-Social Market Economy is acquired from national, European and international decision makers through a direct approach. Goals[edit] The goal of the Global Marshall Plan Initiative is to make a substantial contribution to a global eco-social market economy. This eco-social Marshall Plan would include realistic perspectives: to overcome the degrading poverty of half of mankind, which long has been identified as chief cause of the existing world problems to successfully establish global ecological and social standards for a sustainable development to overcome the deep cultural frustration and humiliation experienced by the majority of the world's civilization and at the same time to eliminate the explosive environment that generates international terrorism and endangers global security for a new economic miracle which specifically boosts the human potential of more than three billion people (which until now has been laying absolutely idle). This would ultimately bring use to the whole human race to create fair globalisation and to accomplish human rights and human dignity for everyone. According to the initiative, a Global Marshall Plan could also allow attractive new perspectives for many other problems caused by an unbalanced globalization. Possible impacts for example could be: The wealth and therefore the wages would increase in developing countries, so that the wage pressure in the economies of traditional industrialised countries will drop. The increased demand on the world's market would also then contribute to a heightened job security in industrialised countries. An implementation of ecological goals would be far more realistic than is currently the case, since because poverty is, as the argument goes, one of the reasons for environmental damages in the poorest countries. Who would fight for daily survival, will be hardly convinced of environmental protection. In most parts of the world the implementation of ecological goals can only be realistic when they are directly linked to active promotion of social and ecological development. The model of an open, peaceful, democratic, constitutional and educated civil society, which many see as best guarantee for a good and dynamic future perspective, would be brought forward by the eco-social Marshall Plan. The goal of the Global Marshall Plan Initiative is to globally link appropriate order processes with competitive mechanisms to create value added systems by combining potential, resources and infrastructure with well planned, institutional solutions. A global eco-social market economy would therefore create the right balance between competitive economy, social solidarity and ecological sustainability. The logic of the plan[edit] Central to the logic of a plan is the following basic principle, as introduced by the Global Marshall Plan Initiative: Investments, coordinated market openings and co-financing provide the harmonization that results in social and ecological standards. A form of targeted global overcoming of poverty should therefore emerge that will release especially strong new economic stimuli for the regions concerned, as well as for the whole global economy. By combining new growth with clear ecological standards at the same time a strong environmental approach to economic activities should be encouraged. According to initiative, the new economic, ecological and social perspectives would have a strong impulse for the inner peace of the global community, which in turn is important for a lasting and sustained growth of economy. It is also assumed that the positive effects of a Global Marshall Plan would also consequently increase the pull on governments, who so far have been averse to the eco-social movement. It would reinforce the pressure on these governments to give space for these developments, to reduce corruption and boost Good Governance. Good Governance signifies a well working guidance and control system of a political social unit as a state or a community. The principles often include terms such as transparency, efficiency, participation, responsibility, constitutional state, democracy and justice often belong to the principles. Especially important is that the Global Marshall Plan overcomes old clashes of interests and that it achieves an unusually wide support. One of the surprising intermediate results of the present process is that it is supported by commercial and industrial enterprises and their federations as well as severe critics of the previous form of globalisation and representatives from the “North” and “South”. Several well known representatives of all main political movements, all civil sectors and global acting networks of civil society argued vehemently for the initiative. The existing approaches and ideas of the initiative could open is a real prospect to bridge the wide social gap. Key requirements for a world in balance[edit] Elements of the Global Marshall Plan, including the five interrelated building blocks of the plan, have already been mentioned in previous UN summits, European policy and demands from various NGOs and institutions. The five building blocks, which are continually adapted to the current challenges, form the starting point and at the same time the foundation of the initiative. Further development and implementation of the UN Millennium Development Goals[edit] In September 2000 the United Nations (UN) came together at the General Assembly to discuss the most important challenges in the coming decade. In the final Millennium Declaration, globalization was highlighted as one of the most important current issues. In this declaration, the 192 UN member states committed themselves to the concrete Millennium Development Goals, which should help to ensure everyone benefits from globalization. The UN Millennium Development Goals represent the beliefs of the initiative – the first intermediate step towards fair world order and to sustainable development. It is unlikely that the goals will be achieved by 2015. Many problems have even worsened, highlighting a glaring failure of the international community. If anything, this should be all the more incentive to updates the goals and meet them promptly. Achieving the 0.7% target and raising an additional necessary funds[edit] A series of appropriate and necessary declarations and agreements (such as the above-mentioned Millennium Development Goals) have been only previously implemented to an extremely discouraging extent. If the apparent gap between declaration of intent and ability to act is not soon overcome, we are threatened with an escalation of global problems. Especially worrying is the looming crisis of confidence in decision-making processes on all levels and inability to enact policies in general. The phase of understanding must therefore immediately be followed by a phase of decisive implementation. This involves not only the delivery mechanism (see 5.4) but also all questions of financing. The financial means needed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals lies, after an analysis from the UNO, at around US$50 billion per year plus some $20 billion for the provision of public goods and humanitarian missions. Considering the current situation significantly more resources are needed for development aid and the implementation of the MDGs. By enforcing the 0.7% GNP target, which the United Nations has been aiming at for decades, the means to finance development aid would be available. In comparison: The percentage volume of the US Marshall Plan after the Second World War was 1.3% of gross domestic product (GDP) of the USA – over a time period of 4 years. Global military spending in 2004 amounted to around $1000 billion excluding the cost for the Iraq War. The Iraq War has already cost an additional several hundred billion US dollars. These numbers illustrate that the proposed Global Marshall Plan on the stated level is by all means financeable. Fair taxation on the global value-added processes[edit] As well as market openings and new delivery mechanisms, global development also requires the above-mentioned financial means for international cooperation. Despite the principal way of using national budgets to provide the necessary funds, it would be easier, from a fundamental and procedural point of view, to find another way to allocate these funds. On the one hand, national budgets are not directly charged, but on the other hand, the generated funds could be better separated from the national interests of donating countries, and it is easier to move forward together when everyone moves at the same pace. Since in the past self-contained national interests have repeatedly affected the efficiency of measures for development cooperation and consequently the public reputation of such programs has significantly decreased. An improvement in finding new means of financing could prove critical both politically as well as for the public acceptance of a Global Marshall Plan. Therefore, the initiative urges that for regulatory reasons, due to improved governance action, for increased transparency, and in particular for better controls on the world finance sectors, tax on global value-added processes and the use of Global Commons must be systematically established. Examples of these include a global financial transactions tax, the trade with CO2 emissions allowances in context of climate justice and a kerosene tax. The following are some examples: Financial transactions tax[edit] Another proposal to finance a Global Marshall Plan, which also has support from numerous experts, is a tax on global financial transactions. The financial transaction tax (FTT) is currently on the verge of a breakthrough in the EU. Critics of this idea are concerned that as a result of the tax, the “collective intelligence” in control of highly sensitive financial flows would be charged. On the contrary, in the recent excesses and “bubbles” of international capital, financial markets and the New Economy, this intelligence has proved to be not all that far reaching. However it is in any case only a cautious use of these instruments and this suggested only on a global level. A cautious start could be, for example, a global financial transaction tax of initially 0.01% If this proves to be positive, the value could be increased to 0.02%. With this, $30–40 billion could be raised each year. However it must be acknowledged that such a global tax would require the establishment of new international structures that would possess the necessary authority as well as the effective sanctions. Other considerations[edit] In addition to the two presented financing options, the establishment of a Global Climate Certificate System (GCCS), a Future Bond, an International Finance Facility and a Kerosene Tax are also being discussed. Other important considerations include the debt of development countries, closing offshore tax havens, which deprive national tax systems of some $50 billion every year, dismantling protectionist structures as well as discussions on an international cartel authority. Fair, global partnerships and effective appropriation of funds[edit] A fair partnership in development assistance on all levels and an adequate cash flow are the requirements for a sustainable future perspective for the entire world. Promoting Good Governance, subsidiaries, rationality, education, combating corruption, as well as an appropriation of funds, coordinated and directed at a grass-roots level, are considered crucial for self-regulated development (e.g. micro-financing). To be able to develop the desired effect and gain broad and sustained support of global civil society but also to find the economy and politics, earlier mistakes in development cooperation must be avoided in the implementation of the Global Marshall Plan. The overcoming of global market fundamentalism and the realization of a global eco-social market economy should be made possible by establishing a better framework for the global economy in a fair global agreement. The most appropriate way appears to primarily be the relationship between ethic, economic, ecological, social, cultural and democratic standards with such a programme. The standards and codes of practice are related to (co)financing programmes. The allocation of funds must not be influenced through short-term economic interests of rich countries or through short-term power interests of elites in poor countries. This can best be achieved through a consistent focus on the mentioned standards, an associated accountability, an active and transparent involvement of industry and the organisation of civil society. The first phase of the Global Marshall Plan seeks for the application of the following standards which have already been agreed on by UN member states: Basic economic, social and cultural human rights, which are largely congruent with the core standards of the International Labour Organization (ILO), such as organisational rights, gender equality, prohibition of child labour etc. Standards of international environmental and conservation agreements such as the Convention on Bio-diversity, CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, or the Washington Convention) and the Kyoto Protocol. Ignoring some of these standards represents, in many areas, the most important competitive economic advantages for less developed countries. The example of EU enlargement shows however that agreements on the application of common high standards and protection levels can be achieved, if accompanied by a co-financing of the development of weaker partners by developed countries is ensured. This coupling is profitable for all involved. Previously the most effective ways of enforcing standards on a global level were held by the World Trade Organization (WTO). However the organisation has received criticism like hardly any other. This is mainly because, in accordance with their mandate, they primarily promote the reduction of trade barriers and in doing so, discounts ecological, social and cultural aspects. In the long-term, however, the WTO could still be reformed into a sustainable institution with trade regulations associated with the above-mentioned standards towards a fair, balanced and sustainability-oriented economic system. This should provide all elements of the prospective framework for non-compliance with the same legal action and sanction options. The equality of trade, environmental and social standards through a link with the WTO is one of the central concerns of the initiative. Alternative considerations concerning the enforceability of ecological and social standards focus on strengthening a reformed UN and more efficient means of enforcing social standards within the ILO or human rights. Every level, from the individual and local, to the national and global, has its own, essential function in a globalised world. One accomplishment of the tasks according to the principle of subsidiarity (principle that states matters ought to be handled by the smallest, lowest or least centralized competent authority) is essential for an efficient implementation of a Global Marshall Plan and requires a lot of changes, since the political decision-making structures of today are still far from fulfilling the needs of the growing world society. Knowledge transfers, empowerment, investments directed at education and health must be central to the effort. Important aspects to achieve a reasonable regulatory framework and a self-regulated development include: Fair cooperation based on partnerships on all levels Strengthening of decision-making and organisation opportunities for partner countries Promoting Good Governance and fighting corruption Appropriation of funds, coordinated and directed at a grass-roots level, e.g. micro-credit and adequate funding The ideology that the luck is on the side of the fittest, thus essentially stating that poverty is caused by itself, dismisses the many dimensions of poverty and neglects its causes which lie not finally in the unequal property and power structures that have maintained poverty and dependence for centuries. A worldwide expansion of “Western” development and suppressing our unsustainable, undesirable development does not lead to worldwide wealth in any way, but to cultural impoverishment as well as the destruction of our natural resources. From development aid to development cooperation[edit] The arrogance of the Western civilisation, which is perceived by people as humiliating, degrading and threatening, provokes anti-Western sentiment and provides the breeding ground for hate and violence. There are also unfairly distributed opportunities and a lack of balance of interests. Combating the misery in the world is not just a handout, but humanitarian duty and peace policy is also in our best interests. These days widespread human security can not be achieved when we’re against one another, only when we’re with one another. In addition it is necessary to build mutual trust, to accept those in disadvantaged countries as equal partners and to allow contributions from international negotiation and decision-making processes. Application of funds[edit] Given the above considerations, the Global Marshall Plan Initiative sees the following principles and suggestions for the application of funds as particularly noteworthy: The specific development programmes should be coordinated by the appropriated specialized organisations and programmes of the United Nations. The role of the United Nations must be strengthened. The example of the already established financing organisation “The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria” should be observed to see whether establishing such financing organisation in the UN's own interaction with the economy and civil society is helpful to the key objectives of the Global Marshall Plan. Provided that funds are acquired from world trade tax, it would be worth considering investing this initially into development goals in every economic sector so that income accumulated in these sectors would increase agreement from the economy. An essential tool in the application of funds should be the public tender of proposed programmes from NGOs to maintain the best cost-income ratio in healthier competition. Projects should have clear priority, which are based on entrepreneurial potential of local people – for example small credit banks and development schools where locals are trained by aid workers. In technology transfers, the choice of promoted projects should be orientated above all towards those that teach largest possible number of locals the skills, so they are able to cope on their own as quickly and efficiently as possible. The search for particularly successful, socially efficient and ecological projects and those success criteria should be defined and promoted as new international research priority. In this way the efficiency of many current forms of development assistance could be substantially increased. Framework compatible with sustainability for the global economy: a global Eco-Social Market Economy[edit] With the gradual implementation of a global Eco-Social Market Economy, a framework compatible with sustainability for the global economy will be established and the global market fundamentalism will be overcome. Functioning Global Governance structures need to reform existing institutions and policies (e.g. United Nations, World Trade Organization and World Finance Sector), as well as their coherent linkup to create a functioning whole. Next stages[edit] Currently the initiative for a Global Marshall Plan is supported by more than 5000 individuals, 200 organisations, all Austrian federal states as well as some German states and prominent public figures. In many European and non-European countries the first national and regional structures have been established. From the 19–20 April 2008 representatives from numerous local and regional groups from Germany met in Erfurt to discuss establishing a national initiative with the purpose of a new governance structure of the Global Marshall Plan Initiative. As a result, an Erfurt Declaration was accepted, which expresses the will to establish an umbrella organisation to house the local, regional and national groups. As to not contract initiative's own understanding of its network-like character and open design, the establishment of a national organisation has recently been abandoned. People can belong to numerous organisations, get involved in local groups informally or organize a club. There should not be a national organisation or governing body. As an international initiative, the goals are strategic: implementing a Global Marshall Plan and developing a broad public awareness of globally responsible action. Only an increased awareness and an improved understanding can be a reliable basis to lead the initiative to become better known and to create fairer globalization. The Global Marshall Plan Initiative addresses this with their ideas and suggestions aimed at different audiences: To all people in the world to contribute to the initiative with their knowledge, experiences and ideas To religious organisations as well as the media and artists to spread the ideas of the Global Marshall plan and create awareness To interested groups as well as in NGO organised civil societies. The goal is to join forces and fight for a fair, sustainable globalization together. To science. All disciplines are invited to help to develop the Global Marshall Plan with detailed and interdisciplinary established projects. To the economy to make the Global Marshall Plan one its own concerns to create a socially fair and ecologically responsible economic development To governments and parliaments of nation states to officially support the Global Marshall Plan and to develop it through discussion with other actors. This new quality of global action and problem-solving ability lies in the long-term interests of all countries. To the European Union as an important bearer of hope for the project and for many people in the entire world. The EU member states are faced with the historical opportunity to make the transition from former colonial powers to partners of efficient and comprehensively understood development policies. The EU can and should courageously develop an alternative to current forms of globalisation and consistently advocate them in international negotiations. To the UN and its programmes and specialized organisations that play a central role in the implementation of these projects. Initiatives to reform the UN in the direction of greater efficiency, competency and funding are supported by the initiative. To the G8 to place combating poverty not as short-term measures such as aid and debt relief in the foreground, but to fight structural poverty through a reform of global regulations and institution at their roots. Shortly after establishing the Global Marshall Plan Initiative, Karolin and Frithjof Finkbeiner founded the Global Marshall Plan Foundation. From them on, the foundation took over from the duties originally assigned to the Global Contract Foundation of an international coordination office of the initiative. Since the foundation has acted as secretariat for the initiative, taking care of the proper application of logos, networking actors and promoting many innovative projects with the help of numerous supporters. Alongside the support of the children's initiative Plant-for-the-Planet, which is active in more than 193 countries, it is possible to organize more international conferences, as for example the Commons Forum, and train around 40 participants through the multiplier training of the Global Marshall Plan Academy that take places yearly. Some of the more than 200 organizations that support the Global Marshall Plan Initiative, set up a coordination circle for the initiative in December 2010 in Munich and took over the political and content related duties that had until then been shared out between others. The coordination circle develops strategic and content positions of the Global Marshall Plan Initiative, decides which projects to support, works on further development of content and is responsible for the yearly initiative meeting. Since November 2011 members have busied themselves with the development of a list of demands for the financial crisis. The current paper can be downloaded from the initiative's website. The current projects of the initiative are the University Days: Eco-Social Market Economy and Sustainability, a collaborative project between the initiative and 5 other organizations, as well as other multiplier training through the internationalisation and offer of other formats within the Global Marshall Plan Academy. Both projects are supported by the Global Marshall Plan Foundation. The foundation of one of three project offices finances the University Days, for the Global Marshall Plan the organizational administration. The support and maintenance of local activities through the coordination office, the coordination and communication of speakers and lecturers are additional important component of the commitment of the initiative. Supporters[edit] Supporters of the initiative include Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Hubert Weinzierl (BUND), Rita Süssmuth, Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker, Franz Josef Radermacher, Jakob von Uexküll, Ulrich Martin Drescher, Renée Ernst, Sandra Maischberger (all from Germany), Josef Riegler, Franz Fischler (Austria), Prince El Hassan bin Talal (Jordan), Vandana Shiva (India), Jane Goodall (UK) and approximately 5000 supporters from Germany and Austria. The supporting organisations include the Club of Rome, the Eco-Social Europe, the German Federal Association of Economic Development and Foreign Economic Affairs, AIESEC Germany and Austria, Cap Anamur/German Emergency Doctors, VENRO (umbrella organisation of development non-governmental organisations), UN Millennium Campaign Germany as well as all the federal states of Austria. In January 2007 the state parliament of Thuringia became the first national parliament in Germany to commit the goals of the Global Marshall Plan. The parliament paper (Parliament paper 4/2658) also requested the Thuringia state government to support the development of a concrete package of measures for the implementation of the Global Marshall Plan and to raise awareness with prominent example projects and information events in Thuringia as well reporting on progress every three years in state parliament. Since November 2007 the city of Munich has also supported the Global Marshall Plan. An up-to-date list of supports can be found on the Global Marshall Plan website. On a local level[edit] Since Spring 2004, a year after the initiative was founded, the local and university groups were founded by supporters in numerous places. The members of these groups stand together for a World in Balance to support the goal of a fairer world. Again and again new like-minded people are brought together by getting involved in their area. The members of predominantly German-speaking areas (Germany, Austria and Switzerland) as well as international operating local groups and individual contact points operate projects for raising awareness. Through bottom-up activities, supporters clear up to those around them topics such as the climate crisis, global poverty and other inequalities to contribute actively towards the necessary changes. With the active announcement of the Global Marshall Plan the supporters understand as lobbying for the common goal – a World in Balance – and act from the centre of society, pressurizing politics and the economy. The Global Marshall Plan University Group was brought to life in 2004 as the first local group. They already organised series of lectures with personalities such as nobel prize winner Muhammad Yunus and was an incentive and model for other local groups. Currently there are more than 33 contact points worldwide, 23 of which are in German speaking countries acting locally. Literature[edit] Al Gore: Wege zum Gleichgewicht.

Composed of a network of more than 5000 supporters from all levels of society, brought together from politics, economics and civil society, the Initiative is based on five core goals for fair globalization. Through its network-like character, it is organized through even hierarchies and without a centre. Everyone is invited to actively participate and take action with their circles and the accompanying opportunities to implement a World in Balance. The goal of the Global Marshall Plan Initiative is to establish a framework compatible with sustainability for the global economy – a global Eco-Social Market Economy. Contents 1 Origins 2 Self-understanding 3 Goals 4 The logic of the plan 5 Key requirements for a world in balance 5.1 Further development and implementation of the UN Millennium Development Goals 5.2 Achieving the 0.7% target and raising an additional necessary funds 5.3 Fair taxation on the global value-added processes 5.3.1 Financial transactions tax 5.3.2 Other considerations 5.4 Fair, global partnerships and effective appropriation of funds 5.4.1 From development aid to development cooperation 5.4.2 Application of funds 5.5 Framework compatible with sustainability for the global economy: a global Eco-Social Market Economy 6 Next stages 6.1 Supporters 7 On a local level 8 Literature 9 External links 10 References Origins[edit] Al Gore - Author of ""Earth in the Balance: Ecology and the Human Spirit"" The idea of a Global Marshall Plan was first published in 1990 by U.S. politician, entrepreneur and environmentalist Al Gore in his book “Earth in the Balance: Ecology and the Human Spirit”. The choice of name deliberately recalls the historical Marshall Plan after the Second World War (officially: European Recovery Program), a symbol for hope, solidarity and peace. The idea of a Global Marshall Plan was not new but had already been endorsed in the 1990s by personalities from a variety of sectors: Kofi Annan, Al Gore, Hans Küng, Susan George, Mikhail Gorbachov, His Royal Highness Prince El Hassan bin Talal of Jordan, George Soros, Lutz Wicke, Georg Winter and many others (Global Contract). As early as the beginning of the 1990s an ecological Marshall Plan was established by prominent personalities such as journalist Franz Alt and German Green politician Joscka Fisher. Along with many other supporters, they called for the establishment of an eco-social market economy, 100 billion DM put towards the environment every year and a kerosene tax. As the world increasingly finds itself in a difficult, unsustainable situation as a result of rapid globalization, both in terms of environmental issues, poverty and unequal distribution, as well as the disproportionate cultural balance, on 16 May 2003 representatives from 16 civil society organizations revived the original idea for a global Marshall Plan as a movement for world peace, sustainability and justice, and at the Frankfurt airport, the Global Marshall Plan initiative was launched. Since the initiative should be organized as a network, i.e. locally and without hierarchies, the coordination of tasks and activities was assigned to different people and institutions: the coordination of content was taken up by Prof. Dr. Franz-Josef Radermacher as Head of FAW/n, politicians, and Josef Riegler, with particular importance on an EU level and the Eco-Social Forum Europe. The coordination, initiation and promotion of supporters’ activities internationally were assigned the Global Contract Foundation and Frithjof Finkbeiner. Due to the enormous positive response and the wide range of activities, this commission was soon transferred to the Global Marshall Plan Foundation. The long-term goal of the initiative is to establish a global eco-social market economy and alter the current failing global framework to lead to long-lasting peace and sustainability. From the beginning, the founders set themselves the goal of developing the initiative as openly as possible and also of winning over the support of the economy. All actors and parts of the global society should find that in the Global Marshall Plan one-sided organization can constructively be prevented. The initiative aims to provide the greatest possible support to the world to ensure that the plan is continually developed in its substance, quality, implementation and coverage. In a series of lectures in 2003–4, the initiative was refined further. Eventually the first report on the Global Marshall Plan Initiative (“Global Marshall Plan – A Planetary Contract for a global Eco-Social Market Economy) was compiled. It was published in September 2004. In the meantime, more and more members of the European Parliament and national parliaments began to back the initiative. Soon organizations from the civil society and the economy followed, as well as the first university. The initiative has been received very well internationally and has grown into a network made up of over 5000 individual supporters, organizations as well as numerous federal states and communities. Believing that change will come from the centre of society, supporters raise awareness of the issues surrounding globalization and motivate those around them for the implementation of fair globalization. Lectures are an essential part of spreading the word. By raising awareness and informing, alliances are formed and pressure is created from “bottom-up”. Those motivated are trained through multiplier training in Global Marshall Plan Academies. Self-understanding[edit] The material prosperity of mankind has never before experienced such an increase. Nevertheless poverty, deprivation and the resulting illnesses are still alarmingly widespread. The increasing overexploitation of nature, the waste of limited resources and the expected catastrophic climate consequences linked to pollution will in the next 30 years present mankind with its biggest challenge yet. The unsustainable consumption of developing countries, poverty and population growth are among the key problems. Many hundreds of millions of people do not benefit from the positive effects of ongoing globalization. this has further increased the income gap between rich industrial nations and the poorest developing countries. The spread of AIDS and looming population growth also accelerate this gap. Any effort to overcome this unsustainable development will be four times more difficult in the future, or even impossible, if a fundamental turnaround is not set in place soon. The Global Marshall Plan Initiative wants to strengthen these turnarounds. With the self-understanding of a network-style movement for a World in Balance, positively aligned powers from politics, economics, science and civil society are brought together in a wide-ranging alliance based on the key requirements of fair globalization. This relies on the simultaneous pursuit of “bottom-up” and “top-down” approach, thus raising awareness and increasing lobbying. Through lectures, information events and publications, more people and groups are continually informed about the absolute necessity and the possibility of a global Eco-Social framework, so that political change comes from the centre of society. At the same time, support for the Global Marshall Plan and a global Eco-Social Market Economy is acquired from national, European and international decision makers through a direct approach. Goals[edit] The goal of the Global Marshall Plan Initiative is to make a substantial contribution to a global eco-social market economy. This eco-social Marshall Plan would include realistic perspectives: to overcome the degrading poverty of half of mankind, which long has been identified as chief cause of the existing world problems to successfully establish global ecological and social standards for a sustainable development to overcome the deep cultural frustration and humiliation experienced by the majority of the world's civilization and at the same time to eliminate the explosive environment that generates international terrorism and endangers global security for a new economic miracle which specifically boosts the human potential of more than three billion people (which until now has been laying absolutely idle). This would ultimately bring use to the whole human race to create fair globalisation and to accomplish human rights and human dignity for everyone. According to the initiative, a Global Marshall Plan could also allow attractive new perspectives for many other problems caused by an unbalanced globalization. Possible impacts for example could be: The wealth and therefore the wages would increase in developing countries, so that the wage pressure in the economies of traditional industrialised countries will drop. The increased demand on the world's market would also then contribute to a heightened job security in industrialised countries. An implementation of ecological goals would be far more realistic than is currently the case, since because poverty is, as the argument goes, one of the reasons for environmental damages in the poorest countries. Who would fight for daily survival, will be hardly convinced of environmental protection. In most parts of the world the implementation of ecological goals can only be realistic when they are directly linked to active promotion of social and ecological development. The model of an open, peaceful, democratic, constitutional and educated civil society, which many see as best guarantee for a good and dynamic future perspective, would be brought forward by the eco-social Marshall Plan. The goal of the Global Marshall Plan Initiative is to globally link appropriate order processes with competitive mechanisms to create value added systems by combining potential, resources and infrastructure with well planned, institutional solutions. A global eco-social market economy would therefore create the right balance between competitive economy, social solidarity and ecological sustainability. The logic of the plan[edit] Central to the logic of a plan is the following basic principle, as introduced by the Global Marshall Plan Initiative: Investments, coordinated market openings and co-financing provide the harmonization that results in social and ecological standards. A form of targeted global overcoming of poverty should therefore emerge that will release especially strong new economic stimuli for the regions concerned, as well as for the whole global economy. By combining new growth with clear ecological standards at the same time a strong environmental approach to economic activities should be encouraged. According to initiative, the new economic, ecological and social perspectives would have a strong impulse for the inner peace of the global community, which in turn is important for a lasting and sustained growth of economy. It is also assumed that the positive effects of a Global Marshall Plan would also consequently increase the pull on governments, who so far have been averse to the eco-social movement. It would reinforce the pressure on these governments to give space for these developments, to reduce corruption and boost Good Governance. Good Governance signifies a well working guidance and control system of a political social unit as a state or a community. The principles often include terms such as transparency, efficiency, participation, responsibility, constitutional state, democracy and justice often belong to the principles. Especially important is that the Global Marshall Plan overcomes old clashes of interests and that it achieves an unusually wide support. One of the surprising intermediate results of the present process is that it is supported by commercial and industrial enterprises and their federations as well as severe critics of the previous form of globalisation and representatives from the “North” and “South”. Several well known representatives of all main political movements, all civil sectors and global acting networks of civil society argued vehemently for the initiative. The existing approaches and ideas of the initiative could open is a real prospect to bridge the wide social gap. Key requirements for a world in balance[edit] Elements of the Global Marshall Plan, including the five interrelated building blocks of the plan, have already been mentioned in previous UN summits, European policy and demands from various NGOs and institutions. The five building blocks, which are continually adapted to the current challenges, form the starting point and at the same time the foundation of the initiative. Further development and implementation of the UN Millennium Development Goals[edit] In September 2000 the United Nations (UN) came together at the General Assembly to discuss the most important challenges in the coming decade. In the final Millennium Declaration, globalization was highlighted as one of the most important current issues. In this declaration, the 192 UN member states committed themselves to the concrete Millennium Development Goals, which should help to ensure everyone benefits from globalization. The UN Millennium Development Goals represent the beliefs of the initiative – the first intermediate step towards fair world order and to sustainable development. It is unlikely that the goals will be achieved by 2015. Many problems have even worsened, highlighting a glaring failure of the international community. If anything, this should be all the more incentive to updates the goals and meet them promptly. Achieving the 0.7% target and raising an additional necessary funds[edit] A series of appropriate and necessary declarations and agreements (such as the above-mentioned Millennium Development Goals) have been only previously implemented to an extremely discouraging extent. If the apparent gap between declaration of intent and ability to act is not soon overcome, we are threatened with an escalation of global problems. Especially worrying is the looming crisis of confidence in decision-making processes on all levels and inability to enact policies in general. The phase of understanding must therefore immediately be followed by a phase of decisive implementation. This involves not only the delivery mechanism (see 5.4) but also all questions of financing. The financial means needed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals lies, after an analysis from the UNO, at around US$50 billion per year plus some $20 billion for the provision of public goods and humanitarian missions. Considering the current situation significantly more resources are needed for development aid and the implementation of the MDGs. By enforcing the 0.7% GNP target, which the United Nations has been aiming at for decades, the means to finance development aid would be available. In comparison: The percentage volume of the US Marshall Plan after the Second World War was 1.3% of gross domestic product (GDP) of the USA – over a time period of 4 years. Global military spending in 2004 amounted to around $1000 billion excluding the cost for the Iraq War. The Iraq War has already cost an additional several hundred billion US dollars. These numbers illustrate that the proposed Global Marshall Plan on the stated level is by all means financeable. Fair taxation on the global value-added processes[edit] As well as market openings and new delivery mechanisms, global development also requires the above-mentioned financial means for international cooperation. Despite the principal way of using national budgets to provide the necessary funds, it would be easier, from a fundamental and procedural point of view, to find another way to allocate these funds. On the one hand, national budgets are not directly charged, but on the other hand, the generated funds could be better separated from the national interests of donating countries, and it is easier to move forward together when everyone moves at the same pace. Since in the past self-contained national interests have repeatedly affected the efficiency of measures for development cooperation and consequently the public reputation of such programs has significantly decreased. An improvement in finding new means of financing could prove critical both politically as well as for the public acceptance of a Global Marshall Plan. Therefore, the initiative urges that for regulatory reasons, due to improved governance action, for increased transparency, and in particular for better controls on the world finance sectors, tax on global value-added processes and the use of Global Commons must be systematically established. Examples of these include a global financial transactions tax, the trade with CO2 emissions allowances in context of climate justice and a kerosene tax. The following are some examples: Financial transactions tax[edit] Another proposal to finance a Global Marshall Plan, which also has support from numerous experts, is a tax on global financial transactions. The financial transaction tax (FTT) is currently on the verge of a breakthrough in the EU. Critics of this idea are concerned that as a result of the tax, the “collective intelligence” in control of highly sensitive financial flows would be charged. On the contrary, in the recent excesses and “bubbles” of international capital, financial markets and the New Economy, this intelligence has proved to be not all that far reaching. However it is in any case only a cautious use of these instruments and this suggested only on a global level. A cautious start could be, for example, a global financial transaction tax of initially 0.01% If this proves to be positive, the value could be increased to 0.02%. With this, $30–40 billion could be raised each year. However it must be acknowledged that such a global tax would require the establishment of new international structures that would possess the necessary authority as well as the effective sanctions. Other considerations[edit] In addition to the two presented financing options, the establishment of a Global Climate Certificate System (GCCS), a Future Bond, an International Finance Facility and a Kerosene Tax are also being discussed. Other important considerations include the debt of development countries, closing offshore tax havens, which deprive national tax systems of some $50 billion every year, dismantling protectionist structures as well as discussions on an international cartel authority. Fair, global partnerships and effective appropriation of funds[edit] A fair partnership in development assistance on all levels and an adequate cash flow are the requirements for a sustainable future perspective for the entire world. Promoting Good Governance, subsidiaries, rationality, education, combating corruption, as well as an appropriation of funds, coordinated and directed at a grass-roots level, are considered crucial for self-regulated development (e.g. micro-financing). To be able to develop the desired effect and gain broad and sustained support of global civil society but also to find the economy and politics, earlier mistakes in development cooperation must be avoided in the implementation of the Global Marshall Plan. The overcoming of global market fundamentalism and the realization of a global eco-social market economy should be made possible by establishing a better framework for the global economy in a fair global agreement. The most appropriate way appears to primarily be the relationship between ethic, economic, ecological, social, cultural and democratic standards with such a programme. The standards and codes of practice are related to (co)financing programmes. The allocation of funds must not be influenced through short-term economic interests of rich countries or through short-term power interests of elites in poor countries. This can best be achieved through a consistent focus on the mentioned standards, an associated accountability, an active and transparent involvement of industry and the organisation of civil society. The first phase of the Global Marshall Plan seeks for the application of the following standards which have already been agreed on by UN member states: Basic economic, social and cultural human rights, which are largely congruent with the core standards of the International Labour Organization (ILO), such as organisational rights, gender equality, prohibition of child labour etc. Standards of international environmental and conservation agreements such as the Convention on Bio-diversity, CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, or the Washington Convention) and the Kyoto Protocol. Ignoring some of these standards represents, in many areas, the most important competitive economic advantages for less developed countries. The example of EU enlargement shows however that agreements on the application of common high standards and protection levels can be achieved, if accompanied by a co-financing of the development of weaker partners by developed countries is ensured. This coupling is profitable for all involved. Previously the most effective ways of enforcing standards on a global level were held by the World Trade Organization (WTO). However the organisation has received criticism like hardly any other. This is mainly because, in accordance with their mandate, they primarily promote the reduction of trade barriers and in doing so, discounts ecological, social and cultural aspects. In the long-term, however, the WTO could still be reformed into a sustainable institution with trade regulations associated with the above-mentioned standards towards a fair, balanced and sustainability-oriented economic system. This should provide all elements of the prospective framework for non-compliance with the same legal action and sanction options. The equality of trade, environmental and social standards through a link with the WTO is one of the central concerns of the initiative. Alternative considerations concerning the enforceability of ecological and social standards focus on strengthening a reformed UN and more efficient means of enforcing social standards within the ILO or human rights. Every level, from the individual and local, to the national and global, has its own, essential function in a globalised world. One accomplishment of the tasks according to the principle of subsidiarity (principle that states matters ought to be handled by the smallest, lowest or least centralized competent authority) is essential for an efficient implementation of a Global Marshall Plan and requires a lot of changes, since the political decision-making structures of today are still far from fulfilling the needs of the growing world society. Knowledge transfers, empowerment, investments directed at education and health must be central to the effort. Important aspects to achieve a reasonable regulatory framework and a self-regulated development include: Fair cooperation based on partnerships on all levels Strengthening of decision-making and organisation opportunities for partner countries Promoting Good Governance and fighting corruption Appropriation of funds, coordinated and directed at a grass-roots level, e.g. micro-credit and adequate funding The ideology that the luck is on the side of the fittest, thus essentially stating that poverty is caused by itself, dismisses the many dimensions of poverty and neglects its causes which lie not finally in the unequal property and power structures that have maintained poverty and dependence for centuries. A worldwide expansion of “Western” development and suppressing our unsustainable, undesirable development does not lead to worldwide wealth in any way, but to cultural impoverishment as well as the destruction of our natural resources. From development aid to development cooperation[edit] The arrogance of the Western civilisation, which is perceived by people as humiliating, degrading and threatening, provokes anti-Western sentiment and provides the breeding ground for hate and violence. There are also unfairly distributed opportunities and a lack of balance of interests. Combating the misery in the world is not just a handout, but humanitarian duty and peace policy is also in our best interests. These days widespread human security can not be achieved when we’re against one another, only when we’re with one another. In addition it is necessary to build mutual trust, to accept those in disadvantaged countries as equal partners and to allow contributions from international negotiation and decision-making processes. Application of funds[edit] Given the above considerations, the Global Marshall Plan Initiative sees the following principles and suggestions for the application of funds as particularly noteworthy: The specific development programmes should be coordinated by the appropriated specialized organisations and programmes of the United Nations. The role of the United Nations must be strengthened. The example of the already established financing organisation “The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria” should be observed to see whether establishing such financing organisation in the UN's own interaction with the economy and civil society is helpful to the key objectives of the Global Marshall Plan. Provided that funds are acquired from world trade tax, it would be worth considering investing this initially into development goals in every economic sector so that income accumulated in these sectors would increase agreement from the economy. An essential tool in the application of funds should be the public tender of proposed programmes from NGOs to maintain the best cost-income ratio in healthier competition. Projects should have clear priority, which are based on entrepreneurial potential of local people – for example small credit banks and development schools where locals are trained by aid workers. In technology transfers, the choice of promoted projects should be orientated above all towards those that teach largest possible number of locals the skills, so they are able to cope on their own as quickly and efficiently as possible. The search for particularly successful, socially efficient and ecological projects and those success criteria should be defined and promoted as new international research priority. In this way the efficiency of many current forms of development assistance could be substantially increased. Framework compatible with sustainability for the global economy: a global Eco-Social Market Economy[edit] With the gradual implementation of a global Eco-Social Market Economy, a framework compatible with sustainability for the global economy will be established and the global market fundamentalism will be overcome. Functioning Global Governance structures need to reform existing institutions and policies (e.g. United Nations, World Trade Organization and World Finance Sector), as well as their coherent linkup to create a functioning whole. Next stages[edit] Currently the initiative for a Global Marshall Plan is supported by more than 5000 individuals, 200 organisations, all Austrian federal states as well as some German states and prominent public figures. In many European and non-European countries the first national and regional structures have been established. From the 19–20 April 2008 representatives from numerous local and regional groups from Germany met in Erfurt to discuss establishing a national initiative with the purpose of a new governance structure of the Global Marshall Plan Initiative. As a result, an Erfurt Declaration was accepted, which expresses the will to establish an umbrella organisation to house the local, regional and national groups. As to not contract initiative's own understanding of its network-like character and open design, the establishment of a national organisation has recently been abandoned. People can belong to numerous organisations, get involved in local groups informally or organize a club. There should not be a national organisation or governing body. As an international initiative, the goals are strategic: implementing a Global Marshall Plan and developing a broad public awareness of globally responsible action. Only an increased awareness and an improved understanding can be a reliable basis to lead the initiative to become better known and to create fairer globalization. The Global Marshall Plan Initiative addresses this with their ideas and suggestions aimed at different audiences: To all people in the world to contribute to the initiative with their knowledge, experiences and ideas To religious organisations as well as the media and artists to spread the ideas of the Global Marshall plan and create awareness To interested groups as well as in NGO organised civil societies. The goal is to join forces and fight for a fair, sustainable globalization together. To science. All disciplines are invited to help to develop the Global Marshall Plan with detailed and interdisciplinary established projects. To the economy to make the Global Marshall Plan one its own concerns to create a socially fair and ecologically responsible economic development To governments and parliaments of nation states to officially support the Global Marshall Plan and to develop it through discussion with other actors. This new quality of global action and problem-solving ability lies in the long-term interests of all countries. To the European Union as an important bearer of hope for the project and for many people in the entire world. The EU member states are faced with the historical opportunity to make the transition from former colonial powers to partners of efficient and comprehensively understood development policies. The EU can and should courageously develop an alternative to current forms of globalisation and consistently advocate them in international negotiations. To the UN and its programmes and specialized organisations that play a central role in the implementation of these projects. Initiatives to reform the UN in the direction of greater efficiency, competency and funding are supported by the initiative. To the G8 to place combating poverty not as short-term measures such as aid and debt relief in the foreground, but to fight structural poverty through a reform of global regulations and institution at their roots. Shortly after establishing the Global Marshall Plan Initiative, Karolin and Frithjof Finkbeiner founded the Global Marshall Plan Foundation. From them on, the foundation took over from the duties originally assigned to the Global Contract Foundation of an international coordination office of the initiative. Since the foundation has acted as secretariat for the initiative, taking care of the proper application of logos, networking actors and promoting many innovative projects with the help of numerous supporters. Alongside the support of the children's initiative Plant-for-the-Planet, which is active in more than 193 countries, it is possible to organize more international conferences, as for example the Commons Forum, and train around 40 participants through the multiplier training of the Global Marshall Plan Academy that take places yearly. Some of the more than 200 organizations that support the Global Marshall Plan Initiative, set up a coordination circle for the initiative in December 2010 in Munich and took over the political and content related duties that had until then been shared out between others. The coordination circle develops strategic and content positions of the Global Marshall Plan Initiative, decides which projects to support, works on further development of content and is responsible for the yearly initiative meeting. Since November 2011 members have busied themselves with the development of a list of demands for the financial crisis. The current paper can be downloaded from the initiative's website. The current projects of the initiative are the University Days: Eco-Social Market Economy and Sustainability, a collaborative project between the initiative and 5 other organizations, as well as other multiplier training through the internationalisation and offer of other formats within the Global Marshall Plan Academy. Both projects are supported by the Global Marshall Plan Foundation. The foundation of one of three project offices finances the University Days, for the Global Marshall Plan the organizational administration. The support and maintenance of local activities through the coordination office, the coordination and communication of speakers and lecturers are additional important component of the commitment of the initiative. Supporters[edit] Supporters of the initiative include Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Hubert Weinzierl (BUND), Rita Süssmuth, Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker, Franz Josef Radermacher, Jakob von Uexküll, Ulrich Martin Drescher, Renée Ernst, Sandra Maischberger (all from Germany), Josef Riegler, Franz Fischler (Austria), Prince El Hassan bin Talal (Jordan), Vandana Shiva (India), Jane Goodall (UK) and approximately 5000 supporters from Germany and Austria. The supporting organisations include the Club of Rome, the Eco-Social Europe, the German Federal Association of Economic Development and Foreign Economic Affairs, AIESEC Germany and Austria, Cap Anamur/German Emergency Doctors, VENRO (umbrella organisation of development non-governmental organisations), UN Millennium Campaign Germany as well as all the federal states of Austria. In January 2007 the state parliament of Thuringia became the first national parliament in Germany to commit the goals of the Global Marshall Plan. The parliament paper (Parliament paper 4/2658) also requested the Thuringia state government to support the development of a concrete package of measures for the implementation of the Global Marshall Plan and to raise awareness with prominent example projects and information events in Thuringia as well reporting on progress every three years in state parliament. Since November 2007 the city of Munich has also supported the Global Marshall Plan. An up-to-date list of supports can be found on the Global Marshall Plan website. On a local level[edit] Since Spring 2004, a year after the initiative was founded, the local and university groups were founded by supporters in numerous places. The members of these groups stand together for a World in Balance to support the goal of a fairer world. Again and again new like-minded people are brought together by getting involved in their area. The members of predominantly German-speaking areas (Germany, Austria and Switzerland) as well as international operating local groups and individual contact points operate projects for raising awareness. Through bottom-up activities, supporters clear up to those around them topics such as the climate crisis, global poverty and other inequalities to contribute actively towards the necessary changes. With the active announcement of the Global Marshall Plan the supporters understand as lobbying for the common goal – a World in Balance – and act from the centre of society, pressurizing politics and the economy. The Global Marshall Plan University Group was brought to life in 2004 as the first local group. They already organised series of lectures with personalities such as nobel prize winner Muhammad Yunus and was an incentive and model for other local groups. Currently there are more than 33 contact points worldwide, 23 of which are in German speaking countries acting locally. Literature[edit] Al Gore: Wege zum Gleichgewicht.

Fortunately, with major international meetings set for the second half of 2015, world leaders have an important opportunity to overcome them. Such a turnaround has happened before. At the turn of the century, international negotiations on economic development had also come to a grinding halt. The Seattle ministerial of the World Trade Organization ended without decision, and after two decades of the Washington Consensus, developing countries were frustrated at the US-led international financial institutions. Negotiations for the inaugural United Nations Financing for Development (FfD) conference in Monterrey, Mexico, seemed to be headed nowhere. Then, on September 11, 2001, the United States was hit with major terrorist attacks – a tragic development that somehow catalyzed progress. World leaders agreed to begin the Doha Development Round to ensure that trade negotiations would serve developing countries’ development aspirations. And the 2002 Monterrey FfD conference produced major breakthroughs on foreign and domestic investment, foreign debt, international cooperation, trade, and systemic governance issues. Of course, tragedy is not needed to kick-start progress. This year’s major global meetings – the Conference on Financing for Development in July, the meeting at the United Nations to adopt Sustainable Development Goals in September, and the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris in December – should be sufficient. And the efforts that have gone into preparing for these meetings suggest that there is a will to move forward. But the right program is key. The world needs a well-designed and far-reaching strategy to stimulate industrialization, modeled after the European Recovery Program – the American initiative that enabled Europe to rebuild after World War II. The Marshall Plan, as it is better known, entailed a massive infusion of US aid to support national development efforts in Europe, and is still viewed by many Europeans as America’s finest hour. The Marshall Plan’s impact was felt far beyond Europe’s borders, developing over the following decade into what is probably the most successful economic-development assistance project in human history. Similar policies were introduced in Northeast Asia following the establishment of the People’s Republic of China and the Korean War. Of course, there was a political motivation behind the Marshall Plan’s expansion. By creating a cordon sanitaire of wealthy countries from Western Europe to Northeast Asia, the US hoped to contain the spread of communism at the start of the Cold War. Developing countries that did not serve the same political ends were left out. At its core, however, the Marshall Plan was an economic strategy – and a sound one at that. Crucially, it represented a complete reversal of its predecessor, the Morgenthau Plan, which focused on de-industrialization – with poor results. The plan’s aim – articulated by Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau, Jr., in his 1945 book Germany is Our Problem – was to convert Germany into a “principally agricultural and pastoral” country, in order to prevent its involvement in any new wars. By late 1946, however, economic hardship and unemployment in Germany spurred former US President Herbert Hoover to visit the country on a fact-finding mission. Hoover’s third report of March 18, 1947, called the notion that Germany could be reduced to a pastoral state an “illusion,” which could not be achieved without exterminating or moving 25,000,000 people out of the country. The only alternative was re-industrialization. Less than three months later, Secretary of State George Marshall made his landmark speech at Harvard University announcing the policy reversal. Germany and the rest of Europe were to be re-industrialized, he stated, including through heavy-handed state interventions, such as high duties, quotas, and import prohibitions. Free trade would be possible only after reconstruction, when European countries could compete in international markets. Marshall made three other important points in his short speech. First, in noting the role that the breakdown of trade between urban and rural areas played in Germany’s economic slowdown, he recalled a centuries-old European economic insight: all wealthy countries have cities with a manufacturing sector. “The remedy,” Marshall explained, “lies in…restoring the confidence of the European people,” so that “the manufacturer and the farmer” would be “able and willing to exchange their products for currencies, the continuing value of which is not open to question.” Second, Marshall argued that participatory institutions emerge from economic progress, not the other way around – the opposite of today’s conventional wisdom. As he put it, the policy’s “purpose should be the revival of a working economy in the world, so as to permit the emergence of political and social conditions in which free institutions can exist.” Third, Marshall emphasized that aid should be comprehensive and strategic, in order to foster real progress and development. “Such assistance,” he declared, “must not be on a piecemeal basis as various crises develop. Any assistance that this government may render in the future should provide a cure, rather than a mere palliative.” Marshall’s vision offers important lessons for world leaders seeking to accelerate development today, beginning with the need to reverse the effects of the Washington Consensus on developing and transition economies – effects that resemble those of the Morgenthau Plan. Some countries – including large economies like China and India, which have long protected domestic industry – have been in a better position to benefit from economic globalization. Others have experienced a decline in economic growth and real per capita income, as their industry and agricultural capacity have fallen, especially over the last two decades of the last century. It is time to increase poor economies’ productive capacity and purchasing power, as occurred in Europe in the decade after Marshall’s speech. Marshall’s insight that such shared economic development is the only way to create a lasting peace remains as true as ever. This article is published in collaboration with Project Syndicate.

She argues that reimagining urban planning decisions would reduce vulnerability to disease and improve health. The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened awareness of the significant flaws in our urban infrastructure, and highlighted our lack of attention to how human health, natural systems, and the built environment interact to determine planetary health. It is now clear that our economic system increases food insecurity, our streets prioritize motorized traffic over physical exercise, and our houses increase the risk of disease transmission. We can, and must, do better, by launching a bold new investment program for planetary health. Have you read? These are the most bicycle-friendly cities on the planet Architects are redesigning cities to help with social distancing Colombia's Medellin boosts its 'eco-city' aims during coronavirus recovery The near-universal focus on health prompted by the pandemic presents an opportunity to mobilize all sectors of society toward embracing proactive approaches to inclusive wellbeing. Building resilient and sustainable systems for health, particularly in the context of cities and urban development, will be key in this regard. At best, the failure fully to address the adverse implications of today’s built environments represents a missed opportunity to enable healthy communities. At worst, it actively contributes to disease risk and transmission. In the United Kingdom, for example, the higher COVID-19 mortality in poor people has illustrated the short-sightedness of housing policies that fail to place health and ecological considerations at their center. One positive feature of the current crisis has been the rapid adoption of innovative measures (including versions of universal income) to mitigate the pandemic’s immediate economic impact. This shows that we can address systemic failures quickly when the will exists. Likewise, we must radically reimagine our built environments so that they both strengthen the immediate pandemic response and serve as vehicles for improving long-term health. And while cities will be the primary testing ground for reforms to promote health and wellbeing, it will also be necessary to overhaul existing health governance systems. Although several global philanthropic initiatives have sought to improve urban health and resilience, undoubtedly with positive results, today’s flawed systems need more fundamental disruption. Simply put, the world needs a new Marshall Plan for planetary health – akin to a New Deal for a post-pandemic recovery. Such a scheme would serve as a global guide, aligning incentives and shifting default behaviors toward the shared goal of sustainable healthy urban development. It will require the agreement and participation of national and local governments, private developers, investors, and multilateral organizations, which will take time. Moreover, the initiative would take multiple institutional forms and pathways, some of which may not exist yet. Governments and private-sector actors will need to address three issues in particular. For starters, policymakers should not regard resilience only as an end result. Many of the shocks and stressors that drive acute and protracted health emergencies stem from intentional choices by local and global actors. Beyond adaptation to cope with these shocks and stressors, building resilience must therefore involve confronting the decisions that weaken systems by fostering ecological disruption and disease. In addition, policymakers must tackle the “problem blindness” that results from the temporal and spatial distance between exposure to health risks and subsequent outcomes, especially for diseases with a long arc. For example, there is a disconnect between current urban development and future hospitalizations due to asthma and heart disease, which may be exacerbated by air pollution, exposure to damp environments, and lack of access to safe areas for physical activity. One consequence of problem blindness is attenuated accountability for long-term health. Finally, policymakers will need to address the “wrong pocket problem,” whereby the sector benefiting from an intervention may not be the one that bears the cost of implementing it. This poses a challenge to promoting health through urban development, particularly in the context of siloed public-sector budgets, and will necessitate a redesign of health financing. Alternatives to the current GDP-based approach to economic development already exist. Bhutan has developed a Gross National Happiness index to guide its policymakers, while the Wellbeing Economy Alliance advocates for a wellbeing-based economic system and is being embraced by the governments of New Zealand, Iceland, Scotland, and Wales. But addressing the three issues noted above will require finance and investment in systems for health. The 4 Pillars of Bhutan's Gross National Happiness index. Image: GNH Centre Bhutan Here, multilateral development finance institutions (MDFIs), such as the African and Asian Development Banks, could help. As non-commercial organizations that provide capital for economic development projects across a wide range of member states, such institutions are uniquely positioned to drive a Marshall Plan-type scheme. First, MDFIs have the convening power to bring together heads of member states and private-sector leaders to co-develop and ratify such a plan, while taking regional nuances into account. Second, MDFIs could condition urban infrastructure development loans under the scheme on explicit consideration of a project’s health impacts and health-promotion strategies. Under the plan, lending and borrowing institutions would decide how to mobilize and allocate financial capital on the basis of where the costliest health problems are, and who is best placed to prevent disease. They would also explore creative strategies to encourage intersectoral policies and finance collaborative projects that advance human and planetary health. Such an approach could further catalyze public policy, for example by making the primary performance indicator of urban infrastructure development strategies, policies, and initiatives their contribution to health. The devastating impact of COVID-19 has highlighted the urgent need for ambitious, all-encompassing reforms rather than incremental, piecemeal measures. A global Marshall Plan for planetary health would constitute a radical new approach, and would be an important step toward health-proofing the future of fast-growing cities. In addition to finance and investment from public and private sectors, it will require a social movement (led by the young) to drive the unremitting demand for a healthy post-COVID recovery, supported by research across the sciences, arts, and humanities. Preventing toxic decisions in urban planning and infrastructure development is essential to reduce vulnerability to disease, lessen the need for health care, and bring about better cities and better health for all.

Weighing up the pros and cons.On June 4, 2007, the Austrian Marshall Plan Foundation hosted the conference ‘Marshall Plan, Europe 1947 – Africa 2007’ at Amerika Haus in Vienna. 60 years after George C. Marshall’s historical speech in which he first outlined the European Recovery Program, international experts discussed how to transfer the positive achievementsto other, nowadays troubled parts of the world.‘Balance the world with a Global Marshall Plan’Within the last 60 years the Marshall Plan was often used as a reference model to help develop Third World economies – amongst others by the Global Marshall Plan Initiative. Founded in 2003 by the Club of Rome, the Club of Budapest, the Ecosocial Forum Europe and the Global Contract Foundation, the Global Marshall Plan Initiative considers itself an integrative platform for a world in equilibrium and allies a multitude of positive forces, emanating from politics, business, science and the civil society, all of them aiming at a fair globalization.Franz Fischler, former EU Commissioner and now Chairman of the Ecosocial Forum Europe, Vienna, explained the main goals: rapid implementation of the globally agreed upon UN Millennium Development Goals by 2015, gradual realization of a worldwide Eco-Social Market Economy, overcoming of the market fundamentalism through the establishment of a better regulatory framework for the world economy, and fair collaborative partnership on all levels and an adequate flow of resources. His conclusion: if we act now, we can avoid further problems in the future.‘Understanding economic growth’For Thorvaldur Gylfason, University of Iceland, the question of to grow or not to grow is finally a matter of choice. It is also a matter of justice, for the poor, who usually pay the highest price for economic growth, should also profit from it. Gylfason’s research shows that many of the most important determinants of economic growth are clearly within the purview of economic policy. Liberalization, stabilization, privatization, and education are good for growth. The government has an important role to play – and, indeed, responsibility – in all of these areas.Bryant P. Trick from the U.S. Department of State outlined the Millennium Challenge Account, a bilateral development fund created in January 2004, as a ‘model for development aid based on partnership, in which domestic reforms need to occur’. Klaus Steiner from the Austrian Federal Ministry of European and International Affairs focused on budget support as a modality to deliver aid and to transform the Paris Declaration principles of Ownership, Harmonization, Alignment, Managing for Results and Mutual Accountability into practice.‘Aid is intoxicating’A different view of the question of how to support the development of democratic and economic structures in Africa was presented by Josephat Juma, Inter Region Economic Network, Kenya, a Nairobi-based think tank: ‘Germany’s campaign to coerce wealthy nations to fulfill the aid-increase pledge they made to Africa is addressing the continent’s issues on a wrong note. Africans ought to be responsible and fix their own problems. Giving Africa money makes the continent remain where it is. It makes Africa adopt a culture of letting somebody else fix the problem. Aid is intoxicating! Stopping aid will make Africa start thinking, look inward and begin harnessing its immense physical wealth, intellectual wealth and comparativeadvantage.’After these controversial statements the panel of experts chaired by Johannes Kaup, radio network Ö1, discussed the problem of how the Marshall Plan idea can contribute to a prosperous Africa. And the conclusion matched the quotation from George C. Marshall’s speech that Franz Fischler had started his lecture with: ‘I need not tell you that the world situation is very serious. That must be apparent to all intelligent people.‘Images: NewsletterSign up for our newsletter to receive news and updates regarding new opportunities at the Foundation.

Composed of a network of more than 5000 supporters from all levels of society, brought together from politics, economics and civil society, the Initiative is based on five core goals for fair globalization. Through its network-like character, it is organized through even hierarchies and without a centre. Everyone is invited to actively participate and take action with their circles and the accompanying opportunities to implement a World in Balance. The goal of the Global Marshall Plan Initiative is to establish a framework compatible with sustainability for the global economy – a global Eco-Social Market Economy.

The choice of name deliberately recalls the historical Marshall Plan after the Second World War (officially: European Recovery Program), a symbol for hope, solidarity and peace. The idea of a Global Marshall Plan was not new but had already been endorsed in the 1990s by personalities from a variety of sectors: Kofi Annan, Al Gore, Hans Küng, Susan George, Mikhail Gorbachov, His Royal Highness Prince El Hassan bin Talal of Jordan, George Soros, Lutz Wicke, Georg Winter and many others (Global Contract). As early as the beginning of the 1990s an ecological Marshall Plan was established by prominent personalities such as journalist Franz Alt and German Green politician Joscka Fisher. Along with many other supporters, they called for the establishment of an eco-social market economy, 100 billion DM put towards the environment every year and a kerosene tax. As the world increasingly finds itself in a difficult, unsustainable situation as a result of rapid globalization, both in terms of environmental issues, poverty and unequal distribution, as well as the disproportionate cultural balance, on 16 May 2003 representatives from 16 civil society organizations revived the original idea for a global Marshall Plan as a movement for world peace, sustainability and justice, and at the Frankfurt airport, the Global Marshall Plan initiative was launched. Since the initiative should be organized as a network, i.e. locally and without hierarchies, the coordination of tasks and activities was assigned to different people and institutions: the coordination of content was taken up by Prof. Dr. Franz-Josef Radermacher as Head of FAW/n, politicians, and Josef Riegler, with particular importance on an EU level and the Eco-Social Forum Europe. The coordination, initiation and promotion of supporters’ activities internationally were assigned the Global Contract Foundation and Frithjof Finkbeiner. Due to the enormous positive response and the wide range of activities, this commission was soon transferred to the Global Marshall Plan Foundation. The long-term goal of the initiative is to establish a global eco-social market economy and alter the current failing global framework to lead to long-lasting peace and sustainability. From the beginning, the founders set themselves the goal of developing the initiative as openly as possible and also of winning over the support of the economy. All actors and parts of the global society should find that in the Global Marshall Plan one-sided organization can constructively be prevented. The initiative aims to provide the greatest possible support to the world to ensure that the plan is continually developed in its substance, quality, implementation and coverage. In a series of lectures in 2003–4, the initiative was refined further. Eventually the first report on the Global Marshall Plan Initiative (“Global Marshall Plan – A Planetary Contract for a global Eco-Social Market Economy) was compiled. It was published in September 2004. In the meantime, more and more members of the European Parliament and national parliaments began to back the initiative. Soon organizations from the civil society and the economy followed, as well as the first university. The initiative has been received very well internationally and has grown into a network made up of over 5000 individual supporters, organizations as well as numerous federal states and communities. Believing that change will come from the centre of society, supporters raise awareness of the issues surrounding globalization and motivate those around them for the implementation of fair globalization. Lectures are an essential part of spreading the word. By raising awareness and informing, alliances are formed and pressure is created from “bottom-up”. Those motivated are trained through multiplier training in Global Marshall Plan Academies. Self-understanding[edit] The material prosperity of mankind has never before experienced such an increase. Nevertheless poverty, deprivation and the resulting illnesses are still alarmingly widespread. The increasing overexploitation of nature, the waste of limited resources and the expected catastrophic climate consequences linked to pollution will in the next 30 years present mankind with its biggest challenge yet. The unsustainable consumption of developing countries, poverty and population growth are among the key problems. Many hundreds of millions of people do not benefit from the positive effects of ongoing globalization. this has further increased the income gap between rich industrial nations and the poorest developing countries. The spread of AIDS and looming population growth also accelerate this gap. Any effort to overcome this unsustainable development will be four times more difficult in the future, or even impossible, if a fundamental turnaround is not set in place soon. The Global Marshall Plan Initiative wants to strengthen these turnarounds. With the self-understanding of a network-style movement for a World in Balance, positively aligned powers from politics, economics, science and civil society are brought together in a wide-ranging alliance based on the key requirements of fair globalization. This relies on the simultaneous pursuit of “bottom-up” and “top-down” approach, thus raising awareness and increasing lobbying. Through lectures, information events and publications, more people and groups are continually informed about the absolute necessity and the possibility of a global Eco-Social framework, so that political change comes from the centre of society. At the same time, support for the Global Marshall Plan and a global Eco-Social Market Economy is acquired from national, European and international decision makers through a direct approach. Goals[edit] The goal of the Global Marshall Plan Initiative is to make a substantial contribution to a global eco-social market economy. This eco-social Marshall Plan would include realistic perspectives: to overcome the degrading poverty of half of mankind, which long has been identified as chief cause of the existing world problems to successfully establish global ecological and social standards for a sustainable development to overcome the deep cultural frustration and humiliation experienced by the majority of the world's civilization and at the same time to eliminate the explosive environment that generates international terrorism and endangers global security for a new economic miracle which specifically boosts the human potential of more than three billion people (which until now has been laying absolutely idle). This would ultimately bring use to the whole human race to create fair globalisation and to accomplish human rights and human dignity for everyone. According to the initiative, a Global Marshall Plan could also allow attractive new perspectives for many other problems caused by an unbalanced globalization. Possible impacts for example could be: The wealth and therefore the wages would increase in developing countries, so that the wage pressure in the economies of traditional industrialised countries will drop. The increased demand on the world's market would also then contribute to a heightened job security in industrialised countries. An implementation of ecological goals would be far more realistic than is currently the case, since because poverty is, as the argument goes, one of the reasons for environmental damages in the poorest countries. Who would fight for daily survival, will be hardly convinced of environmental protection. In most parts of the world the implementation of ecological goals can only be realistic when they are directly linked to active promotion of social and ecological development. The model of an open, peaceful, democratic, constitutional and educated civil society, which many see as best guarantee for a good and dynamic future perspective, would be brought forward by the eco-social Marshall Plan. The goal of the Global Marshall Plan Initiative is to globally link appropriate order processes with competitive mechanisms to create value added systems by combining potential, resources and infrastructure with well planned, institutional solutions. A global eco-social market economy would therefore create the right balance between competitive economy, social solidarity and ecological sustainability. The logic of the plan[edit] Central to the logic of a plan is the following basic principle, as introduced by the Global Marshall Plan Initiative: Investments, coordinated market openings and co-financing provide the harmonization that results in social and ecological standards. A form of targeted global overcoming of poverty should therefore emerge that will release especially strong new economic stimuli for the regions concerned, as well as for the whole global economy. By combining new growth with clear ecological standards at the same time a strong environmental approach to economic activities should be encouraged. According to initiative, the new economic, ecological and social perspectives would have a strong impulse for the inner peace of the global community, which in turn is important for a lasting and sustained growth of economy. It is also assumed that the positive effects of a Global Marshall Plan would also consequently increase the pull on governments, who so far have been averse to the eco-social movement. It would reinforce the pressure on these governments to give space for these developments, to reduce corruption and boost Good Governance. Good Governance signifies a well working guidance and control system of a political social unit as a state or a community. The principles often include terms such as transparency, efficiency, participation, responsibility, constitutional state, democracy and justice often belong to the principles. Especially important is that the Global Marshall Plan overcomes old clashes of interests and that it achieves an unusually wide support. One of the surprising intermediate results of the present process is that it is supported by commercial and industrial enterprises and their federations as well as severe critics of the previous form of globalisation and representatives from the “North” and “South”. Several well known representatives of all main political movements, all civil sectors and global acting networks of civil society argued vehemently for the initiative. The existing approaches and ideas of the initiative could open is a real prospect to bridge the wide social gap. Key requirements for a world in balance[edit] Elements of the Global Marshall Plan, including the five interrelated building blocks of the plan, have already been mentioned in previous UN summits, European policy and demands from various NGOs and institutions. The five building blocks, which are continually adapted to the current challenges, form the starting point and at the same time the foundation of the initiative. Further development and implementation of the UN Millennium Development Goals[edit] In September 2000 the United Nations (UN) came together at the General Assembly to discuss the most important challenges in the coming decade. In the final Millennium Declaration, globalization was highlighted as one of the most important current issues. In this declaration, the 192 UN member states committed themselves to the concrete Millennium Development Goals, which should help to ensure everyone benefits from globalization. The UN Millennium Development Goals represent the beliefs of the initiative – the first intermediate step towards fair world order and to sustainable development. It is unlikely that the goals will be achieved by 2015. Many problems have even worsened, highlighting a glaring failure of the international community. If anything, this should be all the more incentive to updates the goals and meet them promptly. Achieving the 0.7% target and raising an additional necessary funds[edit] A series of appropriate and necessary declarations and agreements (such as the above-mentioned Millennium Development Goals) have been only previously implemented to an extremely discouraging extent. If the apparent gap between declaration of intent and ability to act is not soon overcome, we are threatened with an escalation of global problems. Especially worrying is the looming crisis of confidence in decision-making processes on all levels and inability to enact policies in general. The phase of understanding must therefore immediately be followed by a phase of decisive implementation. This involves not only the delivery mechanism (see 5.4) but also all questions of financing. The financial means needed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals lies, after an analysis from the UNO, at around US$50 billion per year plus some $20 billion for the provision of public goods and humanitarian missions. Considering the current situation significantly more resources are needed for development aid and the implementation of the MDGs. By enforcing the 0.7% GNP target, which the United Nations has been aiming at for decades, the means to finance development aid would be available. In comparison: The percentage volume of the US Marshall Plan after the Second World War was 1.3% of gross domestic product (GDP) of the USA – over a time period of 4 years. Global military spending in 2004 amounted to around $1000 billion excluding the cost for the Iraq War. The Iraq War has already cost an additional several hundred billion US dollars. These numbers illustrate that the proposed Global Marshall Plan on the stated level is by all means financeable. Fair taxation on the global value-added processes[edit] As well as market openings and new delivery mechanisms, global development also requires the above-mentioned financial means for international cooperation. Despite the principal way of using national budgets to provide the necessary funds, it would be easier, from a fundamental and procedural point of view, to find another way to allocate these funds. On the one hand, national budgets are not directly charged, but on the other hand, the generated funds could be better separated from the national interests of donating countries, and it is easier to move forward together when everyone moves at the same pace. Since in the past self-contained national interests have repeatedly affected the efficiency of measures for development cooperation and consequently the public reputation of such programs has significantly decreased. An improvement in finding new means of financing could prove critical both politically as well as for the public acceptance of a Global Marshall Plan. Therefore, the initiative urges that for regulatory reasons, due to improved governance action, for increased transparency, and in particular for better controls on the world finance sectors, tax on global value-added processes and the use of Global Commons must be systematically established. Examples of these include a global financial transactions tax, the trade with CO2 emissions allowances in context of climate justice and a kerosene tax. The following are some examples: Financial transactions tax[edit] Another proposal to finance a Global Marshall Plan, which also has support from numerous experts, is a tax on global financial transactions. The financial transaction tax (FTT) is currently on the verge of a breakthrough in the EU. Critics of this idea are concerned that as a result of the tax, the “collective intelligence” in control of highly sensitive financial flows would be charged. On the contrary, in the recent excesses and “bubbles” of international capital, financial markets and the New Economy, this intelligence has proved to be not all that far reaching. However it is in any case only a cautious use of these instruments and this suggested only on a global level. A cautious start could be, for example, a global financial transaction tax of initially 0.01% If this proves to be positive, the value could be increased to 0.02%. With this, $30–40 billion could be raised each year. However it must be acknowledged that such a global tax would require the establishment of new international structures that would possess the necessary authority as well as the effective sanctions. Other considerations[edit] In addition to the two presented financing options, the establishment of a Global Climate Certificate System (GCCS), a Future Bond, an International Finance Facility and a Kerosene Tax are also being discussed. Other important considerations include the debt of development countries, closing offshore tax havens, which deprive national tax systems of some $50 billion every year, dismantling protectionist structures as well as discussions on an international cartel authority. Fair, global partnerships and effective appropriation of funds[edit] A fair partnership in development assistance on all levels and an adequate cash flow are the requirements for a sustainable future perspective for the entire world. Promoting Good Governance, subsidiaries, rationality, education, combating corruption, as well as an appropriation of funds, coordinated and directed at a grass-roots level, are considered crucial for self-regulated development (e.g. micro-financing). To be able to develop the desired effect and gain broad and sustained support of global civil society but also to find the economy and politics, earlier mistakes in development cooperation must be avoided in the implementation of the Global Marshall Plan. The overcoming of global market fundamentalism and the realization of a global eco-social market economy should be made possible by establishing a better framework for the global economy in a fair global agreement. The most appropriate way appears to primarily be the relationship between ethic, economic, ecological, social, cultural and democratic standards with such a programme. The standards and codes of practice are related to (co)financing programmes. The allocation of funds must not be influenced through short-term economic interests of rich countries or through short-term power interests of elites in poor countries. This can best be achieved through a consistent focus on the mentioned standards, an associated accountability, an active and transparent involvement of industry and the organisation of civil society. The first phase of the Global Marshall Plan seeks for the application of the following standards which have already been agreed on by UN member states: Basic economic, social and cultural human rights, which are largely congruent with the core standards of the International Labour Organization (ILO), such as organisational rights, gender equality, prohibition of child labour etc. Standards of international environmental and conservation agreements such as the Convention on Bio-diversity, CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, or the Washington Convention) and the Kyoto Protocol. Ignoring some of these standards represents, in many areas, the most important competitive economic advantages for less developed countries. The example of EU enlargement shows however that agreements on the application of common high standards and protection levels can be achieved, if accompanied by a co-financing of the development of weaker partners by developed countries is ensured. This coupling is profitable for all involved. Previously the most effective ways of enforcing standards on a global level were held by the World Trade Organization (WTO). However the organisation has received criticism like hardly any other. This is mainly because, in accordance with their mandate, they primarily promote the reduction of trade barriers and in doing so, discounts ecological, social and cultural aspects. In the long-term, however, the WTO could still be reformed into a sustainable institution with trade regulations associated with the above-mentioned standards towards a fair, balanced and sustainability-oriented economic system. This should provide all elements of the prospective framework for non-compliance with the same legal action and sanction options. The equality of trade, environmental and social standards through a link with the WTO is one of the central concerns of the initiative. Alternative considerations concerning the enforceability of ecological and social standards focus on strengthening a reformed UN and more efficient means of enforcing social standards within the ILO or human rights. Every level, from the individual and local, to the national and global, has its own, essential function in a globalised world. One accomplishment of the tasks according to the principle of subsidiarity (principle that states matters ought to be handled by the smallest, lowest or least centralized competent authority) is essential for an efficient implementation of a Global Marshall Plan and requires a lot of changes, since the political decision-making structures of today are still far from fulfilling the needs of the growing world society. Knowledge transfers, empowerment, investments directed at education and health must be central to the effort. Important aspects to achieve a reasonable regulatory framework and a self-regulated development include: Fair cooperation based on partnerships on all levels Strengthening of decision-making and organisation opportunities for partner countries Promoting Good Governance and fighting corruption Appropriation of funds, coordinated and directed at a grass-roots level, e.g. micro-credit and adequate funding The ideology that the luck is on the side of the fittest, thus essentially stating that poverty is caused by itself, dismisses the many dimensions of poverty and neglects its causes which lie not finally in the unequal property and power structures that have maintained poverty and dependence for centuries. A worldwide expansion of “Western” development and suppressing our unsustainable, undesirable development does not lead to worldwide wealth in any way, but to cultural impoverishment as well as the destruction of our natural resources. From development aid to development cooperation[edit] The arrogance of the Western civilisation, which is perceived by people as humiliating, degrading and threatening, provokes anti-Western sentiment and provides the breeding ground for hate and violence. There are also unfairly distributed opportunities and a lack of balance of interests. Combating the misery in the world is not just a handout, but humanitarian duty and peace policy is also in our best interests. These days widespread human security can not be achieved when we’re against one another, only when we’re with one another. In addition it is necessary to build mutual trust, to accept those in disadvantaged countries as equal partners and to allow contributions from international negotiation and decision-making processes. Application of funds[edit] Given the above considerations, the Global Marshall Plan Initiative sees the following principles and suggestions for the application of funds as particularly noteworthy: The specific development programmes should be coordinated by the appropriated specialized organisations and programmes of the United Nations. The role of the United Nations must be strengthened. The example of the already established financing organisation “The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria” should be observed to see whether establishing such financing organisation in the UN's own interaction with the economy and civil society is helpful to the key objectives of the Global Marshall Plan. Provided that funds are acquired from world trade tax, it would be worth considering investing this initially into development goals in every economic sector so that income accumulated in these sectors would increase agreement from the economy. An essential tool in the application of funds should be the public tender of proposed programmes from NGOs to maintain the best cost-income ratio in healthier competition. Projects should have clear priority, which are based on entrepreneurial potential of local people – for example small credit banks and development schools where locals are trained by aid workers. In technology transfers, the choice of promoted projects should be orientated above all towards those that teach largest possible number of locals the skills, so they are able to cope on their own as quickly and efficiently as possible. The search for particularly successful, socially efficient and ecological projects and those success criteria should be defined and promoted as new international research priority. In this way the efficiency of many current forms of development assistance could be substantially increased. Framework compatible with sustainability for the global economy: a global Eco-Social Market Economy[edit] With the gradual implementation of a global Eco-Social Market Economy, a framework compatible with sustainability for the global economy will be established and the global market fundamentalism will be overcome. Functioning Global Governance structures need to reform existing institutions and policies (e.g. United Nations, World Trade Organization and World Finance Sector), as well as their coherent linkup to create a functioning whole. Next stages[edit] Currently the initiative for a Global Marshall Plan is supported by more than 5000 individuals, 200 organisations, all Austrian federal states as well as some German states and prominent public figures. In many European and non-European countries the first national and regional structures have been established. From the 19–20 April 2008 representatives from numerous local and regional groups from Germany met in Erfurt to discuss establishing a national initiative with the purpose of a new governance structure of the Global Marshall Plan Initiative. As a result, an Erfurt Declaration was accepted, which expresses the will to establish an umbrella organisation to house the local, regional and national groups. As to not contract initiative's own understanding of its network-like character and open design, the establishment of a national organisation has recently been abandoned. People can belong to numerous organisations, get involved in local groups informally or organize a club. There should not be a national organisation or governing body. As an international initiative, the goals are strategic: implementing a Global Marshall Plan and developing a broad public awareness of globally responsible action. Only an increased awareness and an improved understanding can be a reliable basis to lead the initiative to become better known and to create fairer globalization. The Global Marshall Plan Initiative addresses this with their ideas and suggestions aimed at different audiences: To all people in the world to contribute to the initiative with their knowledge, experiences and ideas To religious organisations as well as the media and artists to spread the ideas of the Global Marshall plan and create awareness To interested groups as well as in NGO organised civil societies. The goal is to join forces and fight for a fair, sustainable globalization together. To science. All disciplines are invited to help to develop the Global Marshall Plan with detailed and interdisciplinary established projects. To the economy to make the Global Marshall Plan one its own concerns to create a socially fair and ecologically responsible economic development To governments and parliaments of nation states to officially support the Global Marshall Plan and to develop it through discussion with other actors. This new quality of global action and problem-solving ability lies in the long-term interests of all countries. To the European Union as an important bearer of hope for the project and for many people in the entire world. The EU member states are faced with the historical opportunity to make the transition from former colonial powers to partners of efficient and comprehensively understood development policies. The EU can and should courageously develop an alternative to current forms of globalisation and consistently advocate them in international negotiations. To the UN and its programmes and specialized organisations that play a central role in the implementation of these projects. Initiatives to reform the UN in the direction of greater efficiency, competency and funding are supported by the initiative. To the G8 to place combating poverty not as short-term measures such as aid and debt relief in the foreground, but to fight structural poverty through a reform of global regulations and institution at their roots. Shortly after establishing the Global Marshall Plan Initiative, Karolin and Frithjof Finkbeiner founded the Global Marshall Plan Foundation. From them on, the foundation took over from the duties originally assigned to the Global Contract Foundation of an international coordination office of the initiative. Since the foundation has acted as secretariat for the initiative, taking care of the proper application of logos, networking actors and promoting many innovative projects with the help of numerous supporters. Alongside the support of the children's initiative Plant-for-the-Planet, which is active in more than 193 countries, it is possible to organize more international conferences, as for example the Commons Forum, and train around 40 participants through the multiplier training of the Global Marshall Plan Academy that take places yearly. Some of the more than 200 organizations that support the Global Marshall Plan Initiative, set up a coordination circle for the initiative in December 2010 in Munich and took over the political and content related duties that had until then been shared out between others. The coordination circle develops strategic and content positions of the Global Marshall Plan Initiative, decides which projects to support, works on further development of content and is responsible for the yearly initiative meeting. Since November 2011 members have busied themselves with the development of a list of demands for the financial crisis. The current paper can be downloaded from the initiative's website. The current projects of the initiative are the University Days: Eco-Social Market Economy and Sustainability, a collaborative project between the initiative and 5 other organizations, as well as other multiplier training through the internationalisation and offer of other formats within the Global Marshall Plan Academy. Both projects are supported by the Global Marshall Plan Foundation. The foundation of one of three project offices finances the University Days, for the Global Marshall Plan the organizational administration. The support and maintenance of local activities through the coordination office, the coordination and communication of speakers and lecturers are additional important component of the commitment of the initiative. Supporters[edit] Supporters of the initiative include Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Hubert Weinzierl (BUND), Rita Süssmuth, Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker, Franz Josef Radermacher, Jakob von Uexküll, Ulrich Martin Drescher, Renée Ernst, Sandra Maischberger (all from Germany), Josef Riegler, Franz Fischler (Austria), Prince El Hassan bin Talal (Jordan), Vandana Shiva (India), Jane Goodall (UK) and approximately 5000 supporters from Germany and Austria. The supporting organisations include the Club of Rome, the Eco-Social Europe, the German Federal Association of Economic Development and Foreign Economic Affairs, AIESEC Germany and Austria, Cap Anamur/German Emergency Doctors, VENRO (umbrella organisation of development non-governmental organisations), UN Millennium Campaign Germany as well as all the federal states of Austria. In January 2007 the state parliament of Thuringia became the first national parliament in Germany to commit the goals of the Global Marshall Plan. The parliament paper (Parliament paper 4/2658) also requested the Thuringia state government to support the development of a concrete package of measures for the implementation of the Global Marshall Plan and to raise awareness with prominent example projects and information events in Thuringia as well reporting on progress every three years in state parliament. Since November 2007 the city of Munich has also supported the Global Marshall Plan. An up-to-date list of supports can be found on the Global Marshall Plan website. On a local level[edit] Since Spring 2004, a year after the initiative was founded, the local and university groups were founded by supporters in numerous places. The members of these groups stand together for a World in Balance to support the goal of a fairer world. Again and again new like-minded people are brought together by getting involved in their area. The members of predominantly German-speaking areas (Germany, Austria and Switzerland) as well as international operating local groups and individual contact points operate projects for raising awareness. Through bottom-up activities, supporters clear up to those around them topics such as the climate crisis, global poverty and other inequalities to contribute actively towards the necessary changes. With the active announcement of the Global Marshall Plan the supporters understand as lobbying for the common goal – a World in Balance – and act from the centre of society, pressurizing politics and the economy. The Global Marshall Plan University Group was brought to life in 2004 as the first local group. They already organised series of lectures with personalities such as nobel prize winner Muhammad Yunus and was an incentive and model for other local groups. Currently there are more than 33 contact points worldwide, 23 of which are in German speaking countries acting locally. Literature[edit] Al Gore: Wege zum Gleichgewicht.

At this Summit held in the year 2000, Dena Merriam and women religious leaders recognized the absence of the feminine perspective at such international forums, and the need to lift up the voices of women in leadership to effectively address the growing conflict emerging around the world. Their response was a convening of 500 women leaders at the very first World Summit of Women Religious and Spiritual Leaders at the Palais des Nations (United Nations) in Geneva in 2002. The success of this Summit and subsequent calls for ongoing peace dialogues prompted Dena to form GPIW in 2002. As a young organization, GPIW began its work through the exploration of the root causes driving conflict in places such as Israel and Palestine, Iraq, Sudan, Afghanistan, Cambodia, and between India and Pakistan and Kashmir. The first five years of organizing women-led dialogues focused on developing approaches to diffuse conflict and engender peace, brought with it lessons and insights that helped nurture GPIW into the next phase of its evolution. The primary lesson revealed by this work is that the understanding, solutions, and momentum to heal external conflict and violence begins with personal transformation and resolution of internal conflict.  Bridging the Inner and OuterJust as rivers change with their landscapes, GPIW’s outer work shifted under the powerful force of this lesson. Global convenings became intimate dialogue exchanges supported by a cocoon of spiritual cultivation practices such as meditation, prayer, and indigenous ceremony,.  These practices allowed for the inner shifts needed to hold an outer discourse imbued with wisdom and an expansive vision - a vision that was compassionate and creative. As part of the work of restoring the balance needed for peace, GPIW has always invited the participation of men into these gatherings.Since 2009 GPIW’s gatherings focused on this integrated model to creatively explore the new paradigms that can succeed the current systems that underly the challenges before us, and in particular the ecological crisis. This means looking closely at our economic structures, the way we grow our food, care for our forests and waters, educate our young, and interact with nature and one another. GPIW brings together individuals from diverse communities and people of deep spiritual wisdom and practice to explore and reimagine new systems that support the whole of life.Nourishing an Interconnected FutureAs GPIW continues to walk along the spiral of space and time, we evolve and adapt as called upon by forces large and small, seen and unseen. Our programs have woven together compassionate leaders working to amplify the intelligence of the heart and the deeper spirit nestled within.   Our work now lies in restoring right relationship with the living Earth. We continue to hear the evolutionary call for an activation of feminine principles in the approach to this healing. And we understand that much responsibility now lies with the younger generation. Over the past three years, GPIW has been focused on nourishing and empowering young leaders who are committed to reestablishing an interconnected, intelligent, expressive, and sacred ecology of living systems, and this may include helping them find the spiritual practices that will strengthen them internally. We draw upon our twenty year history to call upon the wisdom of elders to guide and mentor these new leaders as needed. And we flow forward together into new emergence by lifting up the most sacred of our feminine ways of working - intuitive, non-hierarchical, multi-dimensional, collaborative, nurturing, and humble. We invite you into our experiment, process, and living web as we move into a reverent and intimate relationship with a planetary system to which we already belong.",Global Peace Initiative of Women

She recounts how she has come to see women's spiritual voices as critical to global peace, and why their voices and the agendas and energy they reflect result in differences in approach and outcome. Her initiative has taken shape over the past decade, born of the glaring gap in women's roles at the pivotal Millennium Summit of Religious leaders at the United Nations in August, 2000 (she was co-organizer). She highlights GPIW's evolution from a focus on women's roles in peace making in conflict situations (Israel, Palestine, Iraq) to a wider focus that extends to environment and is inclusive of men and a broad range of traditions. You are truly a guru on engaging spiritual women’s voices in global efforts. How did you come to be so involved? My focus on women’s voices in interfaith events and efforts sharpened after the 2000 Millennium Summit of Religious Leaders. Women were not prominent there, and a number complained, asking for a follow-up event that would address the gap. We convened a meeting of women religious and spiritual leaders in Geneva in 2002, and as a result the Global Peace Initiative of Women (GPIW) was formed. It is an international group, and focuses on peace, but peace broadly defined. Our mission is to look at how to mobilize the spiritual resources for peace that are too often hidden from view. But the effort was never designed to be just about women. Yes, women are the leaders, but it is not just formal religious leaders. We bring in young people and men also. More and more, our events and networks are not just women. But what we want to see, and do see, is women emerging in leadership positions. And we have seen this in many places, including Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India. But how did you get involved in the Millennium Summit in the first place? Had you been involved in interfaith work before that ambitious initiative? I was a seeker from my earliest years, and when I was at Barnard in the early 1970s began to explore spiritual paths, but purely on a personal level. I found my spiritual teacher, Paramahansa Yogananda, when I was 20. Later, in the 1980s after I was divorced, I went back for my masters degree, and studied sacred literature. But I was not happy with the way it was taught, and I decided not to continue on to a PhD and instead went into journalism! But my interest was always there and I continued my study of sacred books. The Millennium Summit for Religious Leaders came about almost by accident, as did my role. It started with conversations between Maurice Strong, who was then working closely with the UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, and Ted Turner, who was considering his huge gift to the United Nations (to make up for what the United States was refusing to pay). Maurice was on Ted Turner’s board and introduced him to Kofi Annan. In the course of the conversation, which was exploring the upcoming heads of state Millennium Summit for the year 2000 at the United Nations, Ted Turner, almost casually, remarked that if you really wanted peace in the world, you should invite religious leaders and ask them to sign a commitment to peace. Kofi replied that this was a good idea. Maurice repeated the comment to his wife Hanne, and Hanne’s immediate reaction was “let’s do it.” So Maurice went back to Kofi and Ted Turner. Ted Turner was rather shocked that his comment was taken so seriously, but agreed to support it. Hanne had recently met Bawa Jain, who had just joined the New York Interfaith Center (he had come to New York to work with his Jain teacher). Hanne suggested to Gillian Sorenson (then Assistant Secretary General for External Relations in Kori Annan’s office) that Bawa help organize the summit. They looked to my father, David Finn, a long time friend of Kofi Annan’s, for advice and help. And my father then volunteered me to work with Bawa on the effort. Up until that point, my interest in religion and spirituality had been entirely academic and personal, but I plunged in, and travelled everywhere for two years as we prepared for the Summit. The issue of having women participate in the Summit came up during the planning phase; for example, Gillian Sorensen said to make sure women were represented. But for Bawa and other religious leaders, that recommendation was not central. Given how new I was to interfaith work, I was in no position to press the issue. I had never been a public speaker nor had I been much in public affairs. I was a writer and thinker, and was in an intense learning mode. But in the course of our travels I developed an important network and could casually bring up questions, like, where are the women religious leaders? The answer was always “we don’t have any,"" and also, “don’t go there."" I stored that in my mind. Clearly the focus was elsewhere: the main question at hand was the Dalai Lama, which took over everything, because the Chinese made sure that he could not be part of the Summit. In the end, the challenge of including women in the Summit was lost. And at the event, there were only a handful of women speakers in plenary sessions, and most of them were not religious leaders. I remember well one horrifying incident at the opening plenary. The Thai delegation of 13 included 12 monks and a nun (Mae Chee Sansanee Sthirasuta, who is now a friend). They were seated in the center section in the General Assembly Hall. A major Hindu leader arrived. The monks in this order were not permitted to see women, and so he could not enter the General Assembly Hall if there was a woman in his path. Mae Chee was sitting just there and so he could not enter. Our staff was frantic trying to get this resolved, and finally I was asked to move her. And I did, but this spoiled the opening for me. I found myself trying to explain and to apologize to her afterwards. There were other things that made the few women spiritual leaders who were at the Summit unhappy. To accommodate for the lack of women religious leaders, we invited prominent women like Jane Goodall, but the women religious leaders felt seriously underrepresented. So a breakfast was organized where these concerns were aired. Indu Jain, head of the Times of India, recommended that we organize a special meeting that would focus on women. So we went ahead, with Kofi Annan’s blessing, which meant that it could be held at the Palais des Nations in Geneva. The meeting took some time in planning, because September 11 intervened. And it took some doing to mobilize the resources we needed to make it happen. The initial reaction we got from many leaders was that wanting to have a meeting of women religious leaders was just American feminism: there are no women religious leaders, we were told. Women are important in faith communities, but not as leaders. There were also problems around Bawa Jain, as many were annoyed at many aspects of the 2000 Summit and did not want to work with him. And resources were initially a problem as we went to raise money. About three million was raised for the 2000 Summit but when we asked for support for a women’s meeting, there was simply nothing. Not a penny from foundations. So we went to women business leaders, and there we were far more successful. We found a united focus. And the meeting went ahead. The October 2002 meeting in Geneva was a great success. None of the grand issues from the 2000 Summit were discussed. The question was, how can women be of service in conflict areas? That’s when Sister Joan Chittister, Reverend Joan Campbell, Venerable Dhammananda, and a constellation of women religious leaders came on board and agreed to form the nucleus of a continuing organization. The Global Peace Initiative of Women Religious and Spiritual Leaders emerged as that new organization. Eventually, as we learned that foundations did not want to support religious leaders, we shortened the name to Global Peace Initiative of Women. And what we found there, and still find, is that there is indeed a real need to bring women’s presence and voices into the leadership of the interfaith world. Women were there before, but they were not leading. And the interfaith mix made it especially complex given the attitudes of some who were in high positions to working with and respecting women. What happened over the succeeding years? What did the GPIW do? That’s how we started! We went on from there to organize a series of peace dialogues. We agreed in Geneva that we must start to mediate some dialogue around the Israel Palestine conflict. Then Iraq happened. We started to bring women together to discuss and look for solutions, in small sessions. And we met with considerable success. I split with Bawa at that time, insofar as we were both following up on the 2000 Millennium Summit. The tacit understanding was that I would take the women’s piece and he would do the rest. But gradually it became clear that many were not happy with this division of labor. Men religious leaders began to gravitate to me, a bit confused about their role in what we at GPIW were doing, asking how they could be part of a women’s initiative. My position took shape, that the effort was not just for women, but that it was led by women. Some men and organizations began to join us, including for example Dharma Drum Mountain. Throughout, the vision was held by a core group, including the two Joans (Chittister and Campbell) and others who were in Geneva, including our dear friend Kamla Chowdhury. The group overall moved a bit more into the mainstream and towards a spiritual more than a formal religious concept. We took on other causes than conflict per se, including the environment and youth. How did you come to be so involved with youth? That came from the United Nations, who approached us, saying they wanted to do something with young people. We had some very interesting meetings but it was not satisfying, because the United Nations had so many issues with religion. But how can you talk about the Millennium Development Goals without talking about spiritual values? How can you not bring in sectarian divides? Yet they were so frightened of being divisive and uneasy about bringing in spiritual voices in the Summits we organized to talk about the MDGs, that I gave up. After two years of trying to bring in those voices and issues, even to talk about values and spiritual dimensions, I came to see that those questions were far too much at the center to agree to let them have a minor role (as the UN wanted). And we were not interested in interfaith per se. We found that working with institutions was a problem because they were too slow to change. How are events different, in your experience, when women are in a majority or in leadership positions? The energy is different, and so is the agenda. What do you see as the next issues? What is the essence of what will bring peace, and how are women spiritual leaders involved? There is no question: women are critical to peace. Women together can go further than any institution. And there may well be a real benefit that so few spiritual women are tied to positions of institutional leadership. True, some very significant people like Joan Chittister and Sister Joan Campbell and, to a degree also Dhammanada in the Buddhist world, can speak to anyone anytime because they have influence and are respected within the religious cultures. There are perhaps a dozen others like them. But we can go much further if we step away from institutional positions. Because what we need to talk about are changes in consciousness. An example of what I mean is the letter that Sister Joan Chittister and 50 other Catholic women leaders and prioresses sent recently about the U.S. Health Care bill. They did that on their own, not asking the bishops and against their position. That’s the direction I see things going. The work of GPIW began to shift about two years ago. From the start I saw the work we had started with women as just a platform for moving in directions that the women leaders thought were important. And to highlight that what they articulated as priorities and framing of issues was important, of value, different, and essential. Can you give examples of the agendas and how they are different? Those are difficult issues to articulate. Some say that there is no difference. Some women in leadership positions today are models of this position: Margaret Thatcher, to hold up one. So we have indeed given a lot of thought to the question. The question of what women bring and how it is different was a central theme of the meeting GPIW organized in Jaipur, India in March 2008. It asked, what are the distinctive values and qualities that we bring. Men, of course, can have and bring the same qualities, the feminine qualities, and we can see some ways in which there is a broader shift in society in that direction. As we began to organize the next, follow up meeting in Aspen, (in November, 2008), we realized that while were seeking out women spiritual leaders, we were also looking for leaders with more contemplative qualities. So again GPIW shifted course, moving along another path. The focus was not so much on women, religion, and peace, but on a more broadly defined agenda. The Fetzer Institute has been influential in supporting that direction (they are organizing a think tank along those lines in June). At Aspen, we had a small and very inspiring discussion about how contemplative traditions should penetrate and influence American society. Interestingly, we have realized that most of the participants are Christian but there are people from other traditions (Sufi, Hindu, and Buddhist especially). And Copenhagen and environment? We see those issues as central and intimately part of the peace agenda. We organized a remarkable group that participated in the December 2009 Copenhagen Summit. So how does this relate to the theme of peace, which was the starting point? We have even thought of changing our name, but decided not to for the time being. The significance of the shift towards the contemplative approaches and disciplines is that we see that peace must be seen in the largest sense. Our work truly began in conflict areas. But now we see that we must engage on climate change and other issues because the issues are all connected. By peace, we really mean that we are looking at consciousness change and at underlying values. Thus we are looking at peace in its broadest definition: the development of sustainable, inclusive, balanced societies that are truly prototypes of more peaceful, harmonious ways of living. We are finding materials that reflect where we are. And in this, even more than before, we find important reasons why women have to lead. Women have not created the structures we now have that are not functioning, so we can more easily lead the changes towards the new structures we need. Women, we find, can more easily envisage and articulate the kinds of change that we need across all parts of society. Can you give any examples of what you mean? We are trying to articulate this hard-to-define sense of what is different. One is a study of what happened to some villages in India when they came under the leadership of women. That led to some real differences; I will send you the study. I have found that when I sat with women, no matter where they come from and how harsh the conditions and conflicts are that they are living, the women, from Israel, Palestine, and Iraq, for example, come as divided as the men, but are far more able to come together on common issues. And the issue where women always come together is the damage that conflict causes to children. No matter how divided they are, they find themselves on the same side of the fence. When a group of women leaders get together, within the first hour or two children always come up. Men can sit together for days of talk and the issue will not come up. Women are simply more finely tuned to how family structures are suffering, and how the different layers of society are damaged. They are also, I have found, more prepared to plunge in to try to solve the problem, more prepared to sacrifice for the solution. They have less need to hold onto positions. That applies even to the hardest core women, who are deeply set in conflict modes, and have suffered terribly. Even they can focus on the issue of children and look for common ground. I have seen this again and again. What do you see our initiative, looking at the intersections of religion, women, and peace, contributing? What are the main challenges we should address? We need to consider whether we are looking at the issues of women and peace or explicitly starting from women and religion. For example, Rev. Joan Campbell has a session at Chautauqua this summer on peace in the Middle East but most of the women who come are secular, as is usually the case. How do we bring in religion? How can we explore how religion informs women’s thinking and actions? I see a great need to empower women in those conflict areas who have strong religious commitments. In most areas with conflict, notably Israel Palestine, Iraq, Afghanistan, and much of Africa (it may be less true for Pakistan where there are women Sufi leaders), there are women involved but very few women of stature. In Israel, for example, they do have women rabbis, but they are marginalized. There are, though, women of real stature who need to be supported and brought into more visible positions. It is truly remarkable how invisible the women are. Take, for example, the Alexandria Process. I do not think that there was a single woman leader there. This is not a minor change, not a minor issue. It is major. And it should be our objective to ensure that does not happen again. And we should explore how the religious dimensions of life inspire peace efforts. That is the area that intersects most directly with my work. We can also explore some specific initiatives. One is the successive meetings of the Rabbis and Imams. Before each meeting they have come to me, looking for women. But I ask, in what role? If they are to be invited as observers, I won’t do it and that has been the pattern in the past. They are coming to us again, and again my question is whether they want seriously to involve women. The next meeting is in India in November, and Sri Sri Ravi Shankar will host it. Doudou Dienne is involved. The major shift will come only when they realize that women need to be at center stage, and core members of the planning group that is shaping strategies for events and institutions. We should also be looking at the obstacles in the way, and at how we can be more effective. How do you see the role of networks? What works and what does not? Networks are the key. And in this field they play particularly essential roles, because everything is based on personal relationships. Building trust is what is important also in religious worlds. But it is important in building networks to be clear as to what your agenda is. It is important to have networks that go across faiths. I have found that it is possible to work deeply with different faiths, in part because I show such interest in different faiths. That interest and curiosity are a critical ingredient to the effort to be able to cross over and share experience. Networks are vital because they are about seeing people as the most important thing. That means that they simply must involve face to face meetings. And that means being willing to travel. Email is important but it works only for some people and there are groups, many Buddhists for example, where it simply does not work. I often have to travel just to see and talk to someone. And there is also the fact of showing the interest and commitment. Again, that means that I must often travel and meet with someone again and again. The personal investment and personal trust are central to relationships in many places, especially Asia. Sister Joan spoke last week at a meeting in Mexico (Gender Justice Dialogue in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, April 18-22, 2010), that I was unaware of. Do you know what it was about? No, frankly. There is so much going on that we simply can’t keep up. That highlights the importance of our own networks. I find that I invest in my network and work hard to keep in touch, to participate in events. But it makes it hard if not impossible to keep track of what others are doing. You are traveling soon. As an illustration of your activities, where are you going? I go to South Korea, then Bangkok and Japan. In Bangkok I will be speaking at a gathering on the occasion of the Buddha’s birthday, and in Japan I meet with a Shinto leader and Shinto organization, Shin u En. The Japanese religious landscape is remarkable, in terms of the resources that are devoted to it and its dynamism. Discover similar content through these related topics and regions.

74,"Global Peace Initiative of Women - Wikipedia Global Peace Initiative of Women From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Global Peace Initiative of Women (GPIW) is an international network of women and men spiritual and community leaders. GPIW developed from the first World Summit of Women Religious and Spiritual Leaders at the Palais des Nations (United Nations) in Geneva in 2002. GPIW places a special emphasis on building interfaith understanding and developing leadership in young community leaders worldwide. It is located in New York City. A major focus of GPIW’s work in the last decade has been to nurture and assist young ecology leaders working on issues related to climate change and the ecological crisis. GPIW explores the root causes of the great imbalance humanity is experiencing by working on the ""inner levels"" and asking how we can reclaim our deepest living connection to Mother Earth and to one another. This work is under the stewardship of a small group of women who work with many others around the world to help manifest the special qualities of the sacred feminine, which enables the inner transformation needed for us to meet the challenges facing Earth’s community of life. In 2011 GPIW held its first Inner Dimensions of Climate Change retreat in northern India. These 4–5 day intergenerational gatherings are held in various regions of the world in partnership with young ecological leaders and spiritual mentors from various backgrounds who are ready to investigate climate change from an ethical and spiritual perspective. Together, participants reflect on the inner shifts and changes that are needed to restructure the way humans are in relationship with the natural world. Since 2011, GPIW has invited and hosted approximately 500 young leaders to attend these retreats. Meetings have been held in Kashmir, Varanasi and Rishikesh, India, and in Morocco, Kenya, Cambodia, Japan, Costa Rica, Germany, Thailand, Cyprus, and the US. Dena Merriam is the founder and convener. The co-chair is Joan Chittister O.S.B., a Benedictine Sister and author.

GPIW is an international network of women and men who come together to tap our collective spiritual wisdom to stimulate reconciliation and healing in areas of conflict and post-conflict, and to deepen understanding of oneness, compassion and the principles of ahimsa (non-harm) as central tenets of life. We believe that a shift in consciousness is needed, a change in heart and mind, if we are as a global community to meet the challenges of climate change, environmental degradation, poverty and hunger, violence and conflict. Central to our work is the belief that the feminine qualities of wholeness, inclusion, and integration have a vital role to play in facilitating this shift and bringing greater balance to our world. Thus we make great effort to draw upon the resources of women spiritual leaders as we seek to empower these vital qualities. http://www.gpiw.org/ https://www.facebook.com/GlobalPeaceInitiativeofWomen/ Peace Sector Peace Sector Coordinators Peace Partners Peace Compassion Reader Promoting Peace Reports and Documents Joint Proclamation of the Charter for Compassion, Compassionate San Antonio, Compassion Houston and Sister Cities International Day of Remembrance, Reflection and Re-Envisioning Our World: A Call to Compassion, Peace and Community Annotated Peace Bibliography: The Role of Women in Peacemaking General Annotated Peace Bibliography Playback Stories Waging Peace About UsCharter for Compassion provides an umbrella for people to engage in collaborative partnerships worldwide.

Photo by Pol Torrente for Engkwentro, used with permission. A virtual exhibit spearheaded by the University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman through its Office for Initiatives for the Culture and the Arts (OICA) honors the legacy of the Diliman Commune. This historic event of 50 years ago saw students, faculty, staff and residents barricading the premier state university’s flagship campus in the national capital for nine days to defend against violent police incursions. The virtual exhibit is entitled “Engkwentro: Sa(la)ysay ng Diliman Commune” (“Encounters: The Narrative and Sense of the Diliman Commune”) and is part of the UP Diliman Arts and Culture Festival held annually between February to April. While UP’s commemorative activities were planned ahead of time, they gained added relevance amid the Rodrigo Duterte government’s targeting of UP as an alleged hotbed of “communist” rebel recruitment. The Department of National Defense (DND) Secretary Delfin Lorenzana on January 18 unilaterally terminated the UP-DND accord which prohibited military forces from entering campus without prior coordination with university administration. A protest art installation by Fine Arts professor Toym Imao recreating the barricades of 1971 has served as the backdrop to protest rallies calling for the upholding of academic freedom. The installation is made of barricades of chairs, desks, and bamboo painted in bright red and towers in front of the administration building, Quezon Hall, a few meters away from the site of the main barricades set up along the university avenue 50 years ago. On February 1, 1971, youth activists installed barricades on main roads along major universities in the national capital and surrounding regions to express solidarity with transport workers who were then on strike against rising oil prices. But at UP Diliman, the killing by a university professor of a student manning the barricades and the violent attempt by police to disperse the barricades spontaneously sparked a full takeover of the campus by protesting students. Students, with the support of faculty, staff and residents declared the campus a “liberated zone” which they dubbed the “Diliman Commune” in reference to the Paris Commune, the 1871 workers’ uprising in Paris whose 100th anniversary was then being commemorated. They set up a “provisional directorate” coordinating the defense and governance on campus, reinforced the barricades, battled police incursions, and held their ground for nine days. The “communards” took over the campus radio DZUP to broadcast radical messages and coordinate actions in the barricades. They also occupied the university press where they produced the newsletter “Bandilang Pula” (“Red Flag”) to disseminate their views and even produced improvised defensive weapons like Molotov cocktails, pillbox (homemade explosives) and kwitis firecrackers to shoo away military helicopters. On February 8, the student-led provisional directorate decided to end the Commune after attaining some of their demands and in order to avert further violence from police forces. The barricades were torn down the next day, but the image of students barricading the country’s top university became a potent symbol of resistance against Ferdinand Marcos who would go on to declare himself dictator a year later in 1972.

Virtual exhibit The exhibition was set up virtually under the direction of Dr. Cecilia De La Paz, head curator and OICA's director so visitors can relive the days of the Diliman Commune from their homes. Written entirely in the Filipino national language, the exhibit details the day-to-day events during the Commune, based on archival research and interviews with key participants and witnesses. It interpreted these encounters through the lens of Filipino national hero Jose Rizal’s 1879 poem “A La Juventud Filipino” (“To the Filipino Youth”), which exhorted young people to offer their talents and intelligence to their country. The archival material includes a digitized copy of the UP administration’s “Final Report of Committee of Inquiry on the Events and Occurrences at the Diliman Campus from February 1 to 9, 1971,” written eyewitness accounts, activist pamphlets and newsletters, newspaper clippings, photos, and even a recording of a broadcast by DZUP. ‘The sixth day.’ Screenshot of a section of the ‘Engkwentro: Sa(la)ysay ng Diliman Commune’ virtual exhibit. Interactive map Alongside the historical narrative is an interactive map of the location of the events, based on a map drawn by Ar. Ringer Manalang of the UP Diliman Office of the Campus Architect and digitally rendered for the exhibit. Viewers can hover over or tap the icons and names of places on the map to show the events of each day: Ang pagmamapa ng mga kaganapan ng Diliman Commune ay ang pagkilala sa kahalagahan ng mga lugar na sangkot sa yugtong ito ng kasaysayan ng UP Diliman – mga lansangan, silid-aralan, opisina, dormitoryo, at mga pook sa loob ng kampus na naging espasyo ng engkwentrong pisikal at ideyolohikal. Bilang lunsuran ng kilos-protesta, hindi naglaon ay naging espasyo ito ng pagbubuwis ng buhay, ng paninindigan sa ideyolohiyang pinanghahawakan, ng tensyong pangkomunidad, at ng paggamit ng sining at agham upang “protektahan” ang kampus ng Diliman bilang kanlungan ng malayang kaisipan. The mapping of the events of the Commune is a recognition of the importance of the places involved in history of UP Diliman in this period – roads, classrooms, offices, dormitories, and places inside the campus that served as spaces for physical and ideological encounters. As the site of protest actions, these subsequently became spaces for the sacrifice of lives, of commitment to their ideological principles, of community tensions, and the use of art and science to “protect” the Diliman campus as a cradle of free thinking. Screenshot of the interactive map of the events of the Diliman Commune in the ‘Engkwentro: Sa(la)ysay ng Diliman Commune’ virtual exhibit. Legacy of the Commune Apart from looking back on the events in 1971, the virtual exhibit explores the Commune and the decades of activist and intellectual foment in the 1960s and 1970s that prompted activism in academic work, inspired artistic and literary works, and underlined the need for asserting the university’s role as a safe space for free expression and intellectual discourse without fear of state repression. One concrete expression of this legacy is the offering of Philippine Studies 21, the General Education subject in UP on the linguistic, cultural, and literary aspects of domination and people’s resistance during the Marcos dictatorship years. As the Philippines continues to teeter towards full-blown authoritarian rule under Duterte, the narrative and historical lessons of the Diliman Commune should serve to inspire the continuing struggle for genuine freedom and democracy in the present. Disclosure: The author is the head researcher for Engkwentro, UP Diliman’s commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Diliman Commune.

Photo by Commonwealth Secretariat via Flickr, CC BY-NC 2.0. This article is part of UPROAR, a Small Media initiative that is urging governments to address digital rights challenges at the Universal Periodic Review (UPR). Last year, Kenya’s long-awaited Data Protection Act was finally assented and put into force. READ MORE: Kenya now has a data protection law. What does this mean for netizens? The Act, whose comprehensive legislation borrows heavily from the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), seeks to create an institutional framework and legal guidelines for processing personal data in Kenya and belonging to Kenyans. It details the procedures that data controllers should follow to collect and process personal data — a move that now sets Kenya on par with 25 other African countries. As the wheels of implementing the Act start to turn, the data protection commissioner — whose appointment is still pending — will have to speedily work to put the structures and systems in place to register data processors and data controllers and facilitate effective data regulation processing operations. This could well become a rush against time as Kenya goes into another presidential election in August 2022.  If the Act is not in place before then, the use of big data could be used once again in the country’s upcoming election. For two consecutive presidential election cycles, the now-defunct Cambridge Analytica helped hijack Kenya’s democracy through its digital interference in shaping public opinion. Mobile social media and the tyranny of numbers Out of a population of 53 million Kenyans, 98 percent own smartphones. According to statistics by  Data reportal, the number of mobile connections in Kenya in January 2020 stood at about 52 million. For a majority, the phone is the only device through which they use to access the internet — especially social media. Social media usage in Kenya has steadily risen over the years.  By January 2020, the figure stood at 8.8 million users — an increase of 13 percent from April 2019 with Facebook and WhatsApp. In 2020, the numbers surged.  Between April and September alone,  mobile data subscriptions rose by 5 percent, according to Kenya’s Communications Authority. Kenya has earned a reputation as one of Africa’s leaders in connectivity and has become the ideal country for running political campaigns on social media. Roughly half of Kenya’s 19.6 million registered voters in the 2017 were millennials (ages 18-35) and first-time voters — the 2022 elections are not likely to be any different. Fake news & Kenya’s political online showdowns Kenya needs to get its act together on data protection laws fast, not just on paper, but on full implementation. Already, with only 20 months to go, East Africa’s leading news publication, The East African, has reported increasing misinformation as Kenya’s political battles go online. Speaking to East Africa, Alphonce Shiundu, the Kenya country editor of the fact-checking organization Africa Check, said that current online political wars mirror the toxic messaging attributed to the disgraced British consulting firm Cambridge Analytica during the 2017 election. During that year's campaign, Kenya's incumbent Jubilee party hired the company to use big data, behavioral micro-targeting and misinformation to pursue victory for incumbent president Uhuru Kenyatta. This is the deep end that the incoming  data commissioner (DC) will be thrown into and expected not only to swim — but to build a data fortress that will prevent political parties from using data to manipulate their electorate or worse still — incite ethnic tension and violence. At the basic level, the new office of the DC will become the place where Kenyans go to file complaints on the misuse of personal data not just by commercial businesses but increasingly by political figures. Kenya ranks in the top three for countries where users receive the most spam texts across the world, data from Truecaller, the Stockholm-based caller identification app, shows. Kenya’s largest telecommunications company, Safaricom, has, on several occasions, come under fire on Twitter from its customers including a 2019 lawsuit by one of their customers for failing to protect their personal details collected through its popular mobile money service, Mpesa after it was revealed that data from 11.5 million Safaricom customers had leaked and ended up on the black market A 2018 research study by Myriad Connect, mobile USSD technology specialists, found that over 70 percent of Kenyans have been the victims of digital financial transaction fraud, or know someone who has, with the majority being via phone calls at 73 percent,  followed by SMS at 57 percent. Kenyan lawyer Ahmednasir Abdullahi tweeted his intention to start a class action lawsuit against Safaricom in September last year for these violations: Seeing the overwhelming response by Kenyan subscribers of Safaricom, I will INSHAALLAH formally write to them next week and then formally start a CLASS ACTION..Safaricom has been MINING DATA and then GIVES access to third parties to our telephones…KENYANS this is how law is made — Ahmednasir Abdullahi SC (@ahmednasirlaw) September 18, 2020 Funding, self-regulation and enforcement According to Mugambi Laibuta, a Kenyan advocate of the High Court of Kenya, the DC appointment will become the start of a long and complicated journey in enforcing data protection and guaranteeing the right to privacy for Kenyans, one that is already riddled with issues such as funding, resourcing and enforcement mechanisms. Laibuta’s opinion, shared via his podcast episode, “How Important is the Data Protection Commissioner?” is that a lack of advanced funding for these government entities will pose a challenge. This will further impede the DC office’s efforts to acquire resources — especially personnel such as data analysts and legal experts — to help carry out its functions. Laibuta also foresees challenges around enforcement mechanisms such as the data controllers’ registration and self-regulation. All data controllers and data processors are required by the Act to be registered with the commissioner. The DC is then required to prescribe thresholds for mandatory registration and consider the nature of the entity — whether the same rules will apply to private corporate SME (small and micro-enterprises), government and other public institutions and nongovernmental organizations. Until such thresholds are prescribed, mandatory registration, Laibuta opines, does not come into play. Laibuta wonders how the commissioner, in consultation with Ministry of ICT Cabinet Secretary Joseph Mucheru, will set these thresholds, placing a heavy burden on both roles to come up with fair solutions. Telecommunications companies, banks and learning institutions are likely to comply, but Laibuta wonders about SMEs’ mechanisms for self-regulation. This continues to be a challenge even for global data protection authorities who continue to face heat over sanctions issued for GDPR violations. It will also be interesting to see how the DC will handle issues as to how public bodies process and store data. Already, there have been growing concerns and allegations on data leaks from government bodies. A Global Voices article last year captured reactions from Kenyans online on the ascension of the Data Protection Act, including some concerns by critics who found the timing suspect due to an ongoing government exercise to consolidate all citizens’ databases under a National Integrated Identity Management System (NIIMS). Although Section 51 of the Data Protection Act creates exemptions for public bodies on matters that are tough on national security, Laibuta hopes that the DC will provide clear guiding principles for public bodies in the public interest as privacy still reigns supreme. Kenya’s data protection law was long overdue. The 2022 election campaigning has already begun. If not prepared, the ghosts of Kenya’s political past may once again come back to haunt its citizens.

Photo by Radio Free Asia. Copyright © 1998-2020, RFA. Used with the permission of Radio Free Asia, 2025 M St. NW, Suite 300, Washington DC 20036. https://www.rfa.org. Myanmar conducted its election on November 8 which was described by official observers as peaceful despite several challenges that threatened to undermine the voting process. The Myanmar-based People’s Alliance for Credible Elections (PACE), the Thailand-based Asian Network for Free Elections (ANFREL), and the United States-based Carter Center have already released preliminary reports with their observations. All of them acknowledged the “success” of the elections while noting reforms that still need to be enacted to make the process more credible and inclusive in the future. Myanmar was under a military regime for several decades until a civilian-led government ushered in the country’s democratic transition in 2010. During the 2015 election, the opposition National League for Democracy (NLD) clinched a historic landslide victory by defeating Union Solidarity and Development Party, a military-backed party. Based on unofficial results, the NLD continued to dominate this year’s election. This could be interpreted as another vote of confidence for the leadership of NLD which is headed by Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. It could also mean that the majority of voters continue to reject the return of the former ruling party established by retired military officials. But the re-election of NLD does not mean the military has already lost power and influence in the government. The military-drafted 2008 Constitution has guaranteed that the Tatmadaw (armed forces) will get 25 percent of the seats in Parliament as well as retain key positions in the government like defense and border control. Global Voices has published articles which echoed some of the key issues highlighted by election observers such as the censorship of campaign speeches, the cancellation of voting in several ethnic communities, the disenfranchisement of the Rohingya ethnic minority, the rise of religious nationalism during the campaign period, and the restriction of free speech targeting critics and activists. What follows are additional issues included in the reports published by PACE, ANFREL, and The Carter Center. PACE deployed 1,888 short-term-observers on election day. Aside from recognizing that voting was peaceful, it also noted that health protocols were enforced in polling stations. All polling stations were well prepared for COVID-19 precaution measures. The majority of polling stations were able to enforce the voters to wear masks, but at more than one-fourth of polling stations, the safe distance was not met during the queue. Health protocols were observed in polling stations, according to the monitoring of PACE. Source: Facebook The pandemic restricted campaign activities favoring certain candidates. PACE elaborated how the ‘stay-at-home’ orders affected the campaign strategies of candidates: This created an uneven playing field between those who have better access to financial resources, media and social media and those with limited resources, as well as between incumbent and the rest of the parties. For its part, ANFREL has 13 long-term observers deployed for 24 days, eight short-term observers deployed for 8 days, and three additional election day observers. ANFREL was able to visit 225 polling stations on election day. Its observers reported some inconsistencies in the implementation of polling procedures but it also concluded that “the integrity of the vote was not affected.” ANFREL welcomed some adjustments in the voting procedure as an improvement in comparison to the 2015 election: …a few welcome revisions were made to election by-laws, for instance enabling internally displaced people, migrant workers and students to vote more easily in their area of temporary residence, and prohibiting polling stations located inside military compounds. It also identified a possible reform that can allow members of religious orders to vote: Another unfortunate feature of the legal framework for elections is the entrenched disenfranchisement of large sectors of the population. First, Article 392(a) of the Constitution disenfranchises all members of religious orders, whose numbers are considerable: the Buddhist clergy alone accounts for well over half a million people. Christian and Hindu priests or nuns are also unable to vote. Meanwhile, The Carter Center had 43 observers who visited 234 polling stations in 10 states and regions. Their overall impression reflected the reports of PACE and ANFREL: “…voters were enthusiastic and able to freely express their will at the polls and choose their elected representatives.” There were election-related violent incidents but these were considered isolated cases: The campaign environment was generally calm and peaceful. However, there were isolated instances of clashes between party supporters, leading to one death, as well as acts of vandalism and destruction of campaign materials in several locations. However, the Carter Center recorded online violence during the campaign which targeted women candidates and an LGBTQ+ candidate: Harassing and hateful content directed at candidates was also observed throughout the campaign period. In some instances, women candidates were attacked in posts containing sexist and other derogatory language. Myanmar’s first openly gay candidate also faced online harassment. Despite most reports affirming the success of Myanmar elections, the USDP said the results are tainted. It is now demanding that a new election should be held under the supervision of the military.

Both organizations care deeply about the world and the stories that other people miss. We’re both interested in grass-roots reporting. We at PRI find GV content a strong tip sheet for the world, and GV editors and newsletters keep us up to date on the very best stories. We, likewise, offer Global Voices a few of our most original stories for GV distribution each week. We both find bigger audiences with each other. And the relationship is easy, natural, no drama. What more could you ask for? Dave Beard and Angilee Shah When I am reprinting the Netizen Report or another Global Voices piece, I know that it has been well reported, is trustworthy, and most importantly, contains the voices of people from the countries (or country) discussed. When international news with a technology dimension breaks—for instance, the news about the warming U.S.-Cuba relationship—I turn to my friends at Global Voices first, because I know they will offer a different, and vital perspective. Torie Bosch It is a pleasure to work with Global Voices! They are efficient, thorough and produce a high-quality work product for an affordable rate. We have been very happy with their work and often recommend them to others who are looking for translation services. Sarah Kerr Ensia magazine works with many of today's leading online media outlets, but our partnership with Global Voices has by far been one of the most successful. Thanks to Global Voices, Ensia's stories are reaching tens of thousands of concerned individuals all around the world! Todd Reubold Global Voices has helped us reach and communicate with people living in areas affected by conflict, war and natural disaster. Thanks to their efforts, we've been able to engage with communities in refugee camps, urban slums and conflict zones. Cultural sensitivity is key when dealing with different religions, cultures and nationalities. Thanks to their translation efforts and understanding of different cultures, our mobile app and platform is now available in seven languages, and they have helped us become even better at communicating with people who are offline and off the grid. Their passion for social good, couple with their expertise in languages and cultures, is a perfect fit for REFUNITE. Ida Jeng Global Voices se ha tornado un aliado esencial para Infoamazonia porque nos permite difundir articulos a una red mucho mas amplia de lectores. Hemos compartido mapas y contenido en la versión en portugués que luego se han traducido a 8 idiomas. Para nosotros es muy importante tener un socio con alcance global y preocupado por la amazonia. Global Voices has become an essential ally for Infoamazonia because we can disseminate articles to a much wider network of readers. We have shared maps and content on GV Portuguese, which have then been translated into eight languages. For us it is very important to have a partner with global reach who is worried about the Amazon. Gustavo Faleiros Llevamos años aprendiendo juntos, colaborando en libros y en internet y esperamos seguir para intentar mejorar la información en el mundo que habla español. GV es un gran compañero de viaje. Visibilizando la participación ciudadana y la información global para poner en marcha los nuevos medios de información, en favor de un mundo más plural. Rompiendo las barreras del idioma, de las agendas de los grandes medios, en favor de la democratización de los contenidos para soñar juntos un mundo más participativo de voces globales. We've spent years learning together, collaborating on books and online, and we hope to continue to try to improve the information available in the Spanish-speaking world. Global Voices is a great travel companion […] breaking down language barriers and mainstream media agendas in order to democratize content so that together we can dream of a more participatory world of global voices.

Xinjiang, which is the Chinese denomination (新疆 which means New Frontier, while Uyghurs often refer to it as the Uyghur Region, or Uyghur lands), is home to Muslim-majority groups that include 11 million Uyghurs and smaller numbers of Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Tatars, Hui and others. Widely portrayed as ‘motherland separatists’ or simply ‘terrorists’ in mainstream Chinese discourse – including in government statements and media – the peoples of the region have been deprived of their most basic human rights, including freedom of religion, of movement and of communicating in their native language. State-led persecution has taken different forms: imprisonment – often with heavy sentences of over 10 years  – and incarceration in internment camps, which, according to expert sources, may contain over a million mostly Muslim minorities. Given the secrecy of the internment camps, which China insists on presenting as ‘vocational training centers’, and the lack of information coming from the country's jails, it is impossible to say how many people have died in incarceration, often without knowing what they were accused of. Press reports suggest the figure could be hundreds or possibly thousands. For the relatives of detainees, located both inside and outside China, the pain of knowing nothing about the wellbeing of their loved ones is relentless and does not lessen as the months and years go past. More detailed information is available via the Xinjiang Victims Database. Global Voices has been reporting regularly on this issue since and continues to update its coverage with stories, essays, testimonies and interviews: China's persecution of Muslim minorities: One Uyghur student living in Turkey shares her story ‘Uyghur pop music humanizes and amplifies their hopes': interview with musicologist Elise Anderson Solo protest in the Netherlands for the Uyghur cause: One man takes on the Chinese state The long journey to Uyghur visibility: An interview with French author Sylvie Lasserre ‘Where is my family?': A question left unanswered for too many Uyghurs living abroad The Uyghur Meshrep: A traditional community gathering censored in China Uyghur emojis help spread message of cultural resistance over social media History repeats itself: Chinese state terror and the dismantling of Uyghur neo-Jadidism Uyghur human rights advocate Dilnur Reyhan laments lack of Muslim solidarity A feeling of hopelessness: Interview with an Uyghur refugee in Turkey Kazakh family of musicians and writers caught in the Xinjiang vortex Letter to China: My Uyghur friend Zainur has been detained in one of your camps for two years From camps to prisons: Xinjiang's next great human rights catastrophe Uyghur man bids to save ‘most extraordinary mom in the world’ from Chinese camp #FreeSerikjan and the long shadow of Xinjiang's camps in neighbouring Kazakhstan How an Uyghur activist felt the long arm of the Chinese Communist Party in Canada ‘Man returns to his native Xinjiang and disappears’ – a story too common for the headlines ‘I won't stop': Kazakh man seeks justice for family caught in China's Xinjiang crackdown Updated 29 January 2021 20:52 GMT Share this: twitter facebook redditEmail Print version Also in 2020 Special Coverage#IdentityMatrix: African languages and digital rights Are reforms in Uzbekistan bringing real change to the people?

89,"Global Voices - Wikipedia Global Voices From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search A major contributor to this article appears to have a close connection with its subject. It may require cleanup to comply with Wikipedia's content policies, particularly neutral point of view. Please discuss further on the talk page. (May 2019) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Global VoicesFounded2004, Berkman Center for Internet & SocietyFocusJournalismArea served GlobalWebsiteglobalvoices.org Global Voices is an international community of writers, bloggers and digital activists that aim to translate and report on what is being said in citizen media worldwide. It is a non-profit project started at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School that grew out of an international bloggers' meeting held in December 2004. The organization was founded by Ethan Zuckerman and Rebecca MacKinnon. In 2008, it became an independent non-profit incorporated in Amsterdam, Netherlands. Contents 1 Objectives 2 Projects 2.1 Global Voices Advocacy 2.2 Rising Voices 2.3 Global Voices Lingua 2.4 RuNet Echo 3 Past projects 3.1 Technology for Transparency Network 3.2 Voices without Votes 3.3 The Witness Hub 4 References 5 External links Objectives[edit] When Global Voices was formed, Its objectives were: first, to enable and empower a community of ""bridge bloggers"" who ""can make a bridge between two languages, or two cultures.""[1] Second to develop tools and resources to make achieving the first objective more effective. It has maintained a working relationship with mainstream media. Reuters, for example, gave Global Voices unrestricted grants from 2006 to 2008.[2] For its contribution to innovation in journalism, Global Voices was granted the 2006 Knight-Batten Grand Prize.[3] Global Voices was also recognized in 2009 with the University of Denver's Anvil of Freedom award for contributions to journalism and democracy.[4] The organization now states its goals as to: ""Call attention to the most interesting conversations and perspectives emerging from citizens’ media around the world by linking to text, photos, podcasts, video and other forms of grassroots citizens’ media."" ""Facilitate the emergence of new citizens’ voices through training, online tutorials, and publicizing the ways in which open-source and free tools can be used safely by people around the world"". ""Advocate for freedom of expression ... and protect the rights of citizen journalists"".[5] Global Voices has a team of regional editors that aggregates and selects conversations from a variety of blogospheres, with a particular focus on non-Western and underrepresented voices. Contributors are volunteers.[6] Projects[edit] Several projects have grown to become successful websites of their own with distinct communities. Global Voices Advocacy[edit] Global Voices Advox[7] (formerly Advocacy) is an international network of bloggers and activists who fight for online free speech and track threats against ""netizens"". Advox were among the first to recognize arrests and killings of bloggers (starting in 2007) and were instrumental in helping to shift the focus of international media rights organizations to include online writers. Rising Voices[edit] Rising Voices seeks to empower under-represented communities to make their voices heard online by providing micro-grants to new projects; developing a series of participatory media tutorials; and cultivating a network of passionate citizen media activists. The first round of micro-grants were awarded in 2007 following a grant from Knight News Challenge Award. Global Voices Lingua[edit] Volunteers who wished to translate Global Voiced content from English into other languages formed Project Lingua in 2007.[8] Since then, translation has become central to Global Voices. There are tens of translation sites existing in Lingua.[9] RuNet Echo[edit] RuNet Echo’s[10] main purpose is to expand and deepen understanding of the Russian Internet (RuNet) and related online communities. Past projects[edit] Technology for Transparency Network[edit] The Technology for Transparency Network[11] was a participatory research and mapping project to gain a better understanding of the current state of online technology projects that increase transparency, government accountability, and civic engagement in Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, South Asia, China, and Central & Eastern Europe. The project is co-funded by Open Society Institute's Information Program and Omidyar Network's Media, Markets & Transparency initiative, and aims to inform both programs' future investments toward transparency, accountability, and civic engagement technology projects. Voices without Votes[edit] During the United States presidential election of 2008 Global Voices was commissioned by Reuters to create a website, Voices without Votes,[12] to track global online conversation about US politics and foreign policy. Amira al Hussaini was editor of the website, and Global Voices authors and editors all contributed in the 8 months leading up to Barack Obama's inauguration in January 2009. The Witness Hub[edit] From 2006-2007, Global Voices and human rights video organization WITNESS collaborated on a pilot project[13] to monitor human rights citizen videos from around the world.[14] The effort was led by Sameer Padania, and won Best New Media Project at the One World Media Awards in 2007.[15] WITNESS developed The Hub as central part of their own website in 2008, launching a community forum where people can upload human rights videos themselves. The Hub was itself archived in 2010,[16] and in collaboration with YouTube and social media curation site Storyful, Witness launched a YouTube Human Rights Channel in May 2012.[17] References[edit] ^ Boyd, Clark (6 April 2005).

Screenshot taken from a YouTube video by TTT Live Online, titled “Flash Floods Affect Maraval And St. Ann's”. Trinidad and Tobago is in the midst of its wet season and on August 3, experienced several bouts of intense rainfall which the country's meteorological office had warned might include “the threat of street flooding […] gusty winds [and] isolated flash flooding”. Although the met office explained that “near-normal rainfall is likely for August to October, but August is likely to be wetter than usual,” no one quite expected the degree of flooding that took place at various locations across the country. Even as the rains were coming down, people were sharing images and videos across social media platforms. The video below, shared widely via WhatsApp, was taken by a driver who was travelling along Saddle Road, in the country's northwest, which runs parallel to the Maraval River: https://globalvoices.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/WhatsApp-Video-2021-08-03-at-4.09.18-PM.mp4 The following photos were also taken along Saddle Road, just further south, at a point where the river course passes underneath the roadway: Two different angles of the flash flooding in Maraval, Trinidad, on August 3, 2021. Photos shared widely via WhatsApp. This video, also forwarded numerous times on WhatsApp, was taken from the vantage point of a residence off Saddle Road, close to the area's Water and Sewerage Authority (WASA) sub-station: https://globalvoices.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/WhatsApp-Video-2021-08-03-at-4.14.50-PM.mp4 On Facebook, the Trinidad and Tobago Weather Center posted various videos it received from social media users in different parts of the country, including these two, also from Maraval—but flooding was also taking place in nearby St. Anns, as the water levels of the St. Ann's River rose rapidly. Comments on the Eckel Avenue flooding prompted social media users to address the question of how construction projects are approved. It is a pressing issue that the Trinidad and Tobago Society of Planners (TTSP) and the Trinidad and Tobago Institute of Architects (TTIA) have been drawing public attention to via a series of articles in the media. Facebook user Kairi Singh commented: If you drive that road you'd notice how the contractor paved over the drains in the road. So the road is a river every time it rains. Trinidad and Tobago Weather Center posted another video, this time on Duncan Street in downtown Port of Spain, within close range of the ironically named East Dry River, which burst its banks: This video, shared via WhatsApp, shows flooding in the same general area, along what appears to be either Picadilly or Observatory Street in east Port of Spain: https://globalvoices.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Eeast-POS.mp4 Comments on various posts called out the practice of littering, which was exacerbating the problem. By late afternoon, as the floodwaters began to subside, clean-up efforts began, with disaster management teams being mobilised to help clear away the mud and debris left behind. As at the time of publication, no casualties were reported, though there was damage to property and vehicles: Citizens were warned to expect traffic delays, especially because the capital's main traffic hub, City Gate, was badly affected: While some commenters were quick to blame the government, Facebook user Christenne Allegra addressed her compatriots: […] ask yourselves if any of u have ever thrown garbage onto the streets of port of Spain, if yes, then you carry just as much blame for your stupidity. Use a bin or take your garbage home! Sasha Shamika Craig answered: This goes hand in Hand. The Borough/City council has to make sure all drainage [is] cleared […] months before the Rain season. Also y'all that don't like to call on them when you're disposing your beds, fridges etc. You just take it [and] dump it at the side of the road or in the rivers. I've seen ppl do this then cry [and] complain when their homes get washed away. Adriia Nurse added: This is what happens when no maintenance work is done! Drains aren't cleared! Rivers aren't dredged! River banks destroyed! Illegal development not stopped! Cleanup efforts continued well into the night.

In 2020, record growth was driven by a surge of installations in China and the US – the world’s two largest wind power markets – who together installed nearly 75 per cent of the new installations in 2020 and account for over half of the world’s total wind power capacity.Today, there is now 743 GW of wind power capacity worldwide, helping to avoid over 1.1 billion tonnes of CO2 globally – equivalent to the annual carbon emissions of South America.Yet, as the clean energy technology with the most decarbonisation potential per MW, the report shows that the current rate of wind power deployment will not be enough to achieve carbon neutrality by the middle of this century, and urgent action must be taken by policymakers now to scale up wind power at the necessary pace. Download the Report A new record year for the wind industry.93 GW of new wind power capacity was installed in 2020, driven by China and the USAchieving this record in the face of disruptiosn to both the global supply chain, project construction and global economy due to the impacts of COVID-19 has demonstrated the incredible resilience of the wind industry. Discover More Data Global wind power capacity is now up to 743 GWThe Asia Pacific region has been increasingly driving growth of the global wind power industry, which now helps the world to avoid over 1.1 billion tonnes of C02 annually – equivalent to the annual carbon emissions of South America. Discover More Data Global wind power growth must triple over the next decade to avoid the worst impact of climate change.The world needs to be installing an average of 180 GW of new wind energy every year to limit global warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, and will need to install up to 280 GW annually from 2030 onwards to maintain a pathway compliant with meeting net zero by 2050. Discover More Data Policymakers must take a ""climate emergency"" approachGWEC is calling on policymakers to take a true ‘climate emergency’ approach to allow a faster ramp up including: Eliminating red tape and reforming administrative structures in order to speed up and streamline licensing and permitting for projects Carry out a massive increase in investments in grid, ports and other infrastructure needed to allow the ramp up in installationsRe-vamp energy markets to ensure that they account for the true social costs of polluting fossil fuels and facilitate a rapid transition to a system based on renewable energy Discover More Data Notice: JavaScript is required for this content.

China remains in the number one spot for the second year in a row for new installations, installing a record 2.4 GW, followed by the UK at 1.8 GW and Germany at 1.1 GW. Offshore wind will continue to grow despite the impacts of COVID-19 and will be key for Green RecoveryOffshore wind is being seen as a major contributor to post-COVID economic recovery by governments around the world. Offshore wind has been less impacted by the pandemic compared to other energy sectors, GWEC Market Intelligence expects that thanks to continued growth 900,000 jobs will be created in the industry over the next decade, demonstrating its viability to be a key driver for a global green recovery Offshore wind will surge to over 234 GW by 2030, led by Asia-PacificGWEC Market Intelligence forecasts that through 2030, more than 205 GW of new offshore wind capacity will be added globally, including at least 6.2 GW of floating offshore wind. This represents a 15 GW increase from the forecasts in GWEC Market Intelligence’s pre-COVID forecast, demonstrating the resilience of the sector to play a major role in powering both the energy transition and a green recovery. Technology innovation will be key to driving growth Floating offshore wind will reach full commercialisation by 2030 with at least 6 GW installed globally. Turbine technology is also set to improve in both efficiency and resilience, resulting in LCOE reductions and increased adoption. Other innovations such as Power-to-X will also play a key role in opening new market opportunities for offshore wind and decarbonising our energy systems.Discover the data See more...Download the Report!

95,"Global Wind Energy Council - Wikipedia Global Wind Energy Council From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Logo The Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) was established in 2005 to provide a credible and representative forum for the entire wind energy sector at an international level. GWEC’s mission is to ensure that wind power is established as one of the world’s leading energy sources, providing substantial environmental and economic benefits.[1] A new report launched by the Global Wind Energy Council predicts that, despite temporary supply chain difficulties, international wind markets are set to continue their strong growth. In 2006, total installed wind power capacity increased by 25% globally, generating some €18 billion (US$23 billion) worth of new generating equipment and bringing global wind power capacity up to more than 74GW. While the European Union is still the leading market in wind energy with over 48GW of installed capacity, other continents such as North America and Asia are developing quickly.

GYDI is uniquely positioned between multiple global networks from which it harnesses collaborative energy and talent to the task of empowering young leaders for climate action.As an accredited NGO with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), GYDI contributes to both the intergovernmental decision-making process and the implementation of those decisions by supporting governments, the UN, and other stakeholders from civil society.Specifically, we align with three key networks around the UNFCCC:YOUNGO (the official Youth Constituency of the UNFCCC), which gathers climate-engaged youth and youth organizations from around the world, bringing the voice of young people into the UNFCCC process and also fostering their collective actions on climate change.ECOS (the Education, Communication, and Outreach Stakeholders community of the UNFCCC), which unites individuals and organizations seeking to leverage education and public engagement for enhanced actions on climate change. The most recent UNFCCC press conference by ECOS is available here (from June, 2019).RINGO (the Research and Independent NGOs constituency), which links the many research and academic entities who contribute to climate action by various means. Many students from RINGO also identity with YOUNGO.These relationships, established during the 10+ years of climate engagement by GYDI's founder and President, Timothy Damon, provide the organization with a unique and varied set of skills, perspectives, access points, and other resources vital to achieving its programmatic objectives and overarching mission.

Home About Us Contact Us Meet Our Mentees Gallery Meet Our Founders Meet Our Mentors Quotes About Us The Global Youth Development Initiative (GYDI) will match students and other young people from different cultures with mentors from other cultures. In many secondary and post-secondary schools, mentorship programs are offered to support students in program completion, confidence building and transitioning to further education or the workforce. Modern technology has made it possible to create useful mentoring relationships amongst people of different cultures. Multiculturalism describes the existence, acceptance, and/or promotion of multiple cultural traditions. Multicultural ideologies and policies vary widely, ranging from the advocacy of equal respect to the various cultures in a society, to a policy of promoting the maintenance of cultural diversity. Multiculturalism promotes maintaining the distinctiveness of multiple cultures. The Global Youth Development Initiative (GYDI will match students and other young people from different cultures with mentors from other cultures. In our day-to-day lives, we are often oblivious to the sheer volume of influencers and social cues that shape the way that we behave in professional environments. Our personal and professional growth far extends the confines of our work environments; instead, our interactions with our peers, our admiration of our role models, and our access and exposure to the successes of those around us are significant contributors to how we grow. In less stable environments, opportunities for professional growth in these capacities can be limited. Particularly in economies where the demand for professional work is limited, it can be difficult to learn so candidly the skills and social cues that are requisites for success in the modern job market. The Global Youth Development Initiative aims to step in where such a gap exists. Basing the pilot programme in Afghanistan, the GYDI seeks to connect students from across Afghanistan at the American University of Afghanistan (AUAF) in Kabul with mentors across the globe and across various disciplines. Connections unlikely to have been made without such an initiative, the GYDI will act as the platform for these students to find the professional and cultural frames of reference they need to be competitive in the global economy. Where the supply of mentors from professional disciplines may be limited in Afghanistan, particularly in its current volatile climate, our programme aims to facilitate the conversations and relationships necessary for these students to build strong networks and achieve their professional goals. This mentoring programme will highlight the 1-year commitment of mentors and mentees, providing monthly themes, goals, and evaluation criteria. The GYDI is tailored to the cultural sensitivities and social climate of the community we are servicing, and will ensure exceptional organization and structure to best suit mentor and mentee needs. The GYDI seeks to ensure that both parties to the relationship will graduate the program with a sense of accomplishment and confidence. The Global Youth Development Initiative is a programme designed to assist aspiring young professionals in conflict and post-conflict zones with the development of their leadership, employability, and networking skills. Basing the 2017 pilot program in Afghanistan, the GYDI seeks to connect students from universities across Afghanistan with mentors across the globe and across various disciplines. This program will act as the platform for these students to find the professional and cultural frames of reference they need to be competitive in the global economy. Where the supply of mentors from professional disciplines may be limited in Afghanistan, particularly in its current volatile climate, our program aims to facilitate the conversations and relationships necessary for these students to build strong networks and achieve their professional goals. In 2018, we moved forward with a second group of Mentees that widened our scope to include students from countries in conflict. We have also expanded by including teen school students, and not just university students. Although still serving, primarily, the Afghan community, we welcome our new mentees from all over the world. We pair students with mentors from different parts of the world. We are very grateful to all who dedicate their time, skills, and effort to contribute to our success.

102,"Our Mission GYDI exists to educate, engage, and empower young people as leaders in tackling the collective challenges facing humanity, such as global climate change and other areas included in the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by world leaders in 2015. GYDI is a registered non-profit under IRS 501(c)(3).We focus on youth because they are the ones who, along with future generations, will suffer the greatest consequences from the various decisions – in governance, policy, economy, investment, and more - which are being made today, often without meaningful input from young people. At the same time, young people also have the greatest motivation for change and ability to develop needed solutions from outside the existing mindset which has lead humanity into these challenges in the first place.These objectives align with the work of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which committed the international community since 1992 to unite in actions to prevent disastrous impacts on the climate system from human causes; and the UNFCCC's landmark 2015 Paris Agreement, which set specific targets for each nation to contribute in terms of reducing their own greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Within the UNFCCC, GYDI focuses on the Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE) agenda, whose 6 elements (see graphic below) closely align with our mission to engage youth and the general public in climate solutions.By developing young leaders and building bridges between youth from around the world, GYDI contributes to achieving the goal of a safe, prosperous, and equitable future for everyone.

Each state or province selects two delegates in addition to one governor to work directly with both the Secretariat staff and regional coordinators. Aside from administering jurisdictional strategies for each member state and province, the Secretariat organizes three additional committees focusing on topical areas of work: the Executive Committee, the Global Committee on Indigenous Peoples & Local Communities, and the Global Steering Committee on Agricultural Production & Tropical Deforestation. Geographical coverage Global, Latin America and The Caribbean, South East Asia, West Africa Name of lead organisation University of Colorado Boulder Type of lead organisation Academic/Research institution Location/Nationality of lead organisation United States of America Description Description The Governors’ Climate & Forests (GCF) Task Force is a subnational collaboration of 38 states and provinces across 10 countries working to protect tropical forests, reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, and promote realistic pathways to forest-maintaining rural development. Objectives The GCF Task Force seeks to empower a coalition of subnational jurisdictions and their civil society and private sector partners to implement innovative jurisdiction-wide programs for sustainable low emissions development built upon improved forest governance, novel technical and financial mechanisms, enhanced opportunities for local communities and indigenous peoples, and ongoing leadership in national, regional, and international climate policy forums. Activities ​Facilitate political engagement and leadership by GCF Task Force Governors and their high-level appointees in subnational, national, and international processes for reducing deforestation and promoting low emissions development. Enable civil servants and their civil society partners to be effective advocates for reducing deforestation and promoting sustainable development within their jurisdictions and beyond by enhancing the capacity of state and provincial governments to address drivers of deforestation. Assist GCF Task Force states and provinces in securing both public and private funding for jurisdictional strategies and low emissions development programs. Administer activities through two Global Steering Committees: the Global Committee on Indigenous Peoples & Local Communities, and the Global Steering Committee on Agricultural Production & Tropical Deforestation. Facilitate multi-stakeholder platforms for collaboration on sustainable development between Governors, civil society, the private sector, indigenous peoples and local communities. Map deep-decarbonization pathways in select states and provinces. One or two success stories achieved Development and revision of California's Tropical Forest Standard, endorsed September 2019—demonstrating California's global leadership on climate action, sending a strong signal to preserve tropical forests while ensuring rigorous social and environmental safeguards for indigenous peoples and local communities, and setting a strong precedent for governments through the tropics to follow in order to attract investment, climate finance, and multi-stakeholder partnerships. The California Tropical Forest Standard adheres to the GCF Task Force's Guiding Principles for Collaboration and Partnership between Subnational Governments, Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities—a set of guiding principles unifying indigenous peoples and forest communities with local governments who are collaboratively working to address deforestation, climate change, and communities’ rights. The Principles have been endorsed by 18 Indigenous Peoples Organizations, 17 Civil Society Organizations, and 34 GCF Task Force member states. Monitoring and Impacts Sustainable Development Impact: Function of initiative Technical dialogue, Capacity building, Political dialogue, Implementation Activity of initiative Knowledge dissemination and exchange, Training and education, Awareness raising and outreach, Knowledge production and innovation, Goal setting (ex-ante) Indicators Goals - Empower a coalition of subnational jurisdictions and their partners to implement jurisdiction-wide programs for sustainable development through multi-stakeholder platforms for collaboration - Facilitate multi-stakeholder partnerships to improve forest governance in conjunction with sustainable commodities production, inclusivity, and engagement, and financing mechanisms - Build capacity and knowledge dissemination through knowledge-sharing workshops across entire regions and beyond - Facilitate high-level political engagement in national, regional, and international climate policy forums - Reduce deforestation in member states and provinces Comments on indicators and goals Indicators measured include number of high-level forest and climate commitments, members with REDD+ related strategies, advancements on subnational partnerships, progress towards reducing deforestation, number of jurisdictions directly accessing key climate and forests funding sources, climate funding disbursed to member states and provinces, cross-jurisdictional exchanges, and members' participation in relevant compliance market regulatory processes. How will goals be achieved We work towards our goals by organizing and implementing cross-jurisdictional knowledge exchanges, capacity-building workshops, preparation and facilitation of high-level political engagement in climate policy forums, project and financing proposal development, project implementation in member states and provinces, and facilitating multi-stakeholder platforms for collaboration towards reducing deforestation and advancing sustainable development. Have you changed or strenghtened your goals To advance the inclusion of indigenous peoples and local communities in all land-use governance decisions, we have formed and strengthen the Global Committee for Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities. Our Executive Committee strengthens collaboration between member states and regions. Our goals have evolved amongst different regions to focus on the primary concerns of each region or state—for example, sustainable inclusion of smallholder oil palm producers in Indonesia has become a focus this year, wherein strengthening solidarity between Amazonian Governors working towards sustainable development (through the Amazon Governors Consortium) is a focus in Brazil and Peru. Progress towards the goals Our targets were primarily met or exceeded in 2019. High-level political engagement amongst Amazonian governors is stronger than ever, we have achieved several landmark commitments and declarations (for example, the endorsement of California's Tropical Forest Standard), and collaboration has increased throughout the entire GCF Task Force network. How are you tracking progress of your initiative We regularly measure outcome indicators and target goals. Progress in each member state and province is displayed directly on our Knowledge Database. Additionally, we send comprehensive annual reports to our donors, which include surveys of each of our member states measuring progress and capacity toward achieving outcomes. Each member state and province also has the opportunity to share progress updates at regional exchanges and at our Annual Meeting.

The Task Force is designed to support jurisdictional approaches to low emissions rural development and reduced emissions from deforestation and land use (REDD+), specifically through performance-based payment schemes and national or state-based greenhouse gas (GHG) compliance regimes.[1] The Task Force was initiated by former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger on November 18, 2008 at the Governors’ Climate Change Summit in Los Angeles, California. At this summit the U.S. states of California, Illinois, and Wisconsin,[a] the Brazilian states of Amapá, Amazonas, Mato Grosso, and Pará, and the Indonesian provinces of Aceh and Papua signed memoranda of understanding (MOUs) supporting cooperation on a number of issues related to climate policy, financing, technological cooperation, and research. These MOUs also called for the creation of a Joint Action Plan to provide a framework for implementing the MOUs in the forest section. The GCF Task Force held its first international meeting in 2009 in Belem, Brazil, where it approved its Joint Action Plan.

We work to support and advance subnational leadership and policy innovation at all levels of government, from Governors to the civil servants doing the hard technical and policy-level work promoting forest conservation and low-emissions development. Our network connects the people with the processes that promote good environmental governance; green financing; securing territorial rights and the well-being of Indigenous Peoples and local communities; and advancing sustainable, low-emissions economic strategies that safeguard forests and the people whoe depend upon them. We promote partnerships with public and private sector stakeholders at multiple levels—from business and supply chain leaders to Indigenous Peoples and local communities. We work to establish and maintain pathways and strategies for effective subnational, national, and international action that reduces deforestation and enhances sustainable economic development and livelihood opportunities. HOW WE BEGAN Our Mission Our mission is to empower state and provincial leaders to implement innovative jurisdictional programs that protect tropical forests and promote low-emissions development. We connect these leaders with partners and stakeholders who support this work—from private sector actors to Indigenous Peoples and local community leaders. We work to unlock financial opportunities to support our states and provinces in their hard work to protect forests and address climate change. We track the impact and performance of key state and provincial actions to understand how we can advance and scale actions for forests and climate. what we do Empowering Governors and civil servants to lead on the forest and climate agenda in national, regional, and international forums. Connecting members and partners to support implementation, learning, and exchange. Unlocking funding and finance opportunities to implement jurisdictional strategies and investment plans. Tracking impact and performance toward climate commitment. Our Theory of Change Our Theory of Change starts from the premise that the key challenges facing efforts to protect forests and reduce greenhouse gas emissions at scale are political and legal fragmentation across multiple levels of governance, limited incentives and support for political leaders and civil servants to focus on sustainable forest and land use, and lack of institutional capacity. theory of change GCF Task Force Secretariat Sustainability, Energy & Environment Complex University of Colorado 4001 Discovery Dr. Suite 340 Boulder, CO 80303 Tel: +1 303 492 3615secretariat@gcftaskforce.org Contact Us STAY CONNECTED Thanks for signing up!

GCF Task Force membership includes 38 states and provinces from Brazil, Indonesia, Columbia, Ivory Coast, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, Spain, and the United States seeking to advance jurisdictional programs for reducing emissions from deforestation and land use and link these activities with emerging greenhouse gas (GHG) compliance regimes and other pay-for-performance opportunities. GCF Task Force Member States & Provinces contain over one-third of the world’s tropical forests—including all of the legal Brazilian Amazon, 85 percent of the Peruvian Amazon, and more than 60 percent of Indonesia’s tropical forests. GCF Task Force Members are leading the way in building robust jurisdictional programs to protect forests, reduce emissions contributing to climate change, and simultaneously enhance rural livelihoods. California, a GCF Task Force Founding Member State, is the only jurisdiction in the world considering provisions to recognize emissions reductions from jurisdictional REDD+ programs as part of its mandatory state-wide cap-and-trade program. Large clusters of member states and provinces in critical tropical forested countries—including Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, and Peru—enhance the efficacy of the GCF Task Force Network in protecting vital forests. Each of these four countries include their own GCF Task Force Country Coordinator; Coordinators support ongoing efforts across their respective countries by sharing experiences, identifying best practices, developing common positions, and collaborating on jurisdictional strategies. The GCF Task Force focuses on all aspects of the efforts to reduce emissions from deforestation and establish lasting frameworks for low-emissions development by sharing experiences and lessons across leading states and provinces, synchronizing efforts across these jurisdictions to develop policies and programs that provide realistic pathways to forest-maintaining rural development, supporting processes for multi-stakeholder participation and engagement, and securing financing for jurisdictional programs from a range of sources—including pay-for-performance public finance, carbon markets, and ongoing efforts to de-carbonize food and commodity supply chains. While the work of the GCF Task Force is conducted directly within member states and provinces, and in international climate policy forums, the Secretariat is based at the University of Colorado and housed under the School of Law. Secretariat staff work directly with Coordinators, delegates, governors, and partners on-the-ground in member states and provinces. The GCF Task Force receives support from the Norwegian Development Agency, Norway’s International Climate and Forest Initiative (NICFI), the United Nations Development Program, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, the Moore Foundation, the Laboratory for Energy and Environmental Policy (LEEP), and The Climate Group. Key partners include the Earth Innovation Institute, Mecanismos de Desarrollo Alternos, Pronatura sur, and many others. Learn more at www.gcftaskforce.org.

Desertification is now rapidly spreading not only in Northeast Asia but also in Central, West, and South Asia. Therefore, there is a strong need to create an international network that can practically and effectively cope with the desertification issue. In 2005, African Union, United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification(UNCCD), United Nations Development Programme(UNDP), and World Bank agreed to establish the Terrafrica Project to act against serious land degradation in Africa. Green Asia suggested the importance of the Terrasia Project along with its roadmap in 2007, and is currently working to increase participations from various domestic and international organizations. Green Asia Network is currently focusing on development of afforestation & sustainable development model in Mongolia, as the core site of Terrasia project. In Mongolia, 90% of the land is currently being affected by desertification. A research by Mongolian Government in 2007 shows that 852 rivers and streams(out of 5,128), 2,277 creeks(out of 9,306) and 1,181 lakes(out of 3,747) have disappeared in recent decades. Three quarters of botanical specimen were also exterminated. Compared to its neighboring country, China, which has also been affected by desertification yet has aggressively conducted the policy to combat desertification at government level, Mongolian government is suffering from the lack of finance and strategic policy.

For several years now, the Federation of Korean Industries and the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry have been making the assertion that “it would be hasty on Korea’s part to make the first move to reduce greenhouse gas emissions when neither China nor the United States is taking any steps.” The influence of the Federation of Korean Industries is quite powerful, as it makes this claim with especial force. As the U.S. and China are the world’s two biggest industrial nations and discharge the most carbon dioxide, let me begin with a discussion regarding these two countries. On November 3rdlast year, it was reported that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) fined automakers Hyundai and Kia $300 million for exaggerated Miles Per Gallon (MPG) ratings. Of this $300 million, $200 million were carbon dioxide emission charges. In addition, according to the EPA, investing in equipment needed for MPG ratings improvement will cost another $50 million. The origin of this issue is actually quite absurd. It started from backlash from American consumers that Hyundai was exaggerating its MPG ratings that were on the window stickers of the cars in thedealers’ showrooms. They were not even cars that were in operation but were rather simply displayed in a showroom that generated $350 million in fines. What do you think of this? You may think that the U.S. is being overly harsh. But this is only the start. You may have heard of this many times before, but this is a real incident: We are at the beginning of an era of change. This is the end of an era in which carbon dioxide has governed our environment. China and the U.S.’ Strategy Regarding Carbon Dioxide: Trade Policy According to a November 12th CNN newscast last year from Beijing, around the time that the November 12th Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Conference was drawing to a close, the President of the People’s Republic of China and the President of the United States of America presented their agreement at the TRADE Summit on a collaboration effort to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 1/3 in their respective countries for 20 years starting immediately. This news story became known to the world as CNN’s most important story on November 12th. According to this agreement, the U.S. will reduce carbon dioxide emissions until the year 2025 by 26-28% (back to 2005 levels), and China will increase clean energy use by 20% by the year 2030. What is interesting is that this agreement came out of a trade, not an environmental, summit. For the past two years, I have been searching for documentation on U.S.-China conferences about carbon dioxide reduction. During that time, there were interesting discussions taking place. From 2013, President Obama has been focusing his second term agenda on carbon dioxide reduction. So, the U.S. administration, without the need for Congressional approval, decided to reduce emissions by 30% by the year 2030. Moreover, the president has declared that the U.S. will reduce emissions by 80% by the year 2050. China went one step further in saying that the National Development and Reform Commission of the People’s Republic of China (NDRC) will reduce carbon dioxide levels by 50% by the year 2050 (back to 2005 levels). In 2014, the NDRC decided that carbon dioxide discharge and air pollution were the nation’s most important issues. It has already invested $277.7 billion to reduce air pollution in Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei by 25%. Furthermore, a month after the June 2013 summit between Obama and Xi Jinping on July 10th, the main topic of discussion at the U.S.-China conference was carbon dioxide reduction. Yet there remained the question of how these countries would prove their carbon dioxide reduction. In the end, carbon dioxide emissions may turn into a kind of trade war between the U.S. and China, and trade retaliation may emerge as a global pattern. South Korea Suffers from U.S.-China Disputes The U.S. and China’s carbon dioxide reduction policies are consistent and are able to link carbon dioxide reduction with commerce. Multiple-party negotiations involving the U.S. and China through the UN are too time-consuming, and mutual agreement is hard to reach. In addition, because agreement through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on carbon dioxide reduction and trade retaliation is impossible, its legally binding power is weak. What the U.S. and China want is a two-party policy on carbon dioxide reduction that allows each of them to engage in trade retaliation. So, after they declare how much carbon dioxide they reduce in their respective countries, the U.S. and China will request beef and carbon dioxide traceability for all incoming goods. If they are unable to meet required levels of reduction, they will have to pay tariffs. And of course this applies to Korea as well. The U.S. and China will continue to lead in technology related to climate change and set climate standards for their own countries and their trade partners, further securing their leadership and channeling this towards their economic development. What I have said thus far is what the Ministry of Foreign Affairs anticipates as well. The Federation of Korean Industries and the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry said that it would be hasty for Korea to try to reduce carbon dioxide emissions when even the U.S. and China were not making such a step. “What the Federation of Korean Industries has said may be comforting but it is not helpful. Korea must try its best to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and must not delay efforts.” Perhaps Korea is not even aware that the U.S. is demanding $300 million in fines from Hyundai and Kia for their carbon dioxide emissions. Whenever seminars that oppose carbon dioxide reduction are held, the end of an era of carbon approaches. As a country that relies on exports for food, Korea must be more careful. The World ThroughKi ChulOh’sEyes: Climate Change and Poverty – Measures to Combat the Ongoing Crisis In the first half of 2015, papers on measures to combat climate change and poverty were published. This time, they addressedcurrent concerns about the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the international food investment dilemma. I. At the Crux of the Poverty Issue: From Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to SDGs The MDGs that the United Nations (UN) has been promoting from 2000 to 2015 will change to the SDGs. The negotiations on these new goals, which beganin 2012, have now come to a conclusion. The Secretary General of the UN published a Synthesis Report in September 2014 and started negotiations in January 2015. Thishas culminated in the selection of the SDGs at the UN General Assembly Commemorative Summit in September of the same year. The purpose of the conversion is to overcome the impending global crisis by consolidating environmental, economic, and societal issues into an overarching problem that the SDGs can combat. Climate change and poverty are issues that the international community, which includes Korea, must attempt to solve for sustainable development. And the solution to this is the SDGs. During the 2014 UN Climate Summit, the UN Secretary General said, “We cannot negotiate with nature. Mother nature does not wait.” The human race cannot exist without a solution to these environmental problems, and we have reached an age in which poverty is difficult to resolve. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said: “Because we don’t have a Planet B, we don’t have a Plan B. In the end, we will have to get used to this changing planet.” II. The World Bank’s Concerns Anyone can question the relationship between the earth’s environmental crisis and poverty. For anyone who has lived through Korea’s rapid industrialization during the 1970s and 80s—a period of time during which the country achieved economic developmentat the expense of the environment—it is a very reasonable question to pose. Hasn’t China also been exploiting its environment for the sake of rapid economic growth these days? Thus, it is easy to consider the environment as something to sacrifice for economic improvement and the amelioration of poverty. Yet it is now time to discard policies that treat the environment as a means to achieve economic prosperity. Why? Consider the following: Must the environment be sacrificed for poor and developing countries to reach prosperity? If it were five years ago, the World Bank, which has been the leader in eliminating global poverty, would have answered in the affirmative. However, after 2012, the World Bank has started to treat the issue of climate change as tantamount to theEbola virus disease. On the October 10, 2014, at the World Bank annual meeting in Washington D.C., World Bank President Young Kim gave the following speech: “Ebola and climate change have one thing in common—we must find solutions to both of these problems. Even until recently, there has been no plan to resolve Ebola and climate change, and even if there were, they were not appropriate. Our indifference will kill the human race. On the one hand, this is because this deadly virus spreads very fast, and on another hand, this is because of the accumulation of air and ocean pollution.” The Word Bank, which has been the leading international organization in global prosperity and advancement, reveals that this global environmental problem is tightly related to the issue of poverty. The organization, which had invested money into the economic development of Korea in the 1970s and 80s, asserts that without solving the problem of climate change, it will be impossible to find a solution to poverty. Now, none of the World Bank’s policies support the idea that the environment must be sacrificed for the achievement of prosperity. The World Bank announced in its “The Turn Downthe Heat” Report (November 2014)that it will be impossible to end poverty without tackling climate change. According to this World Bank report, if mankind does not try to solve the issue of global warming, global temperatures will rise by 4°Cby the end of the 21st century and by 2°Cin the next 20-30 years. This report says that if global temperatures rise 4°C, the earth will experience unprecedented heat waves that will cause a 70% reduction in food production and starvation that will eventually lead to the death of the human race. In the preface of the report, World Bank President Young Kim warned that the imminent 2°Crise in temperature will serve as a barrier to reaching global prosperity and eliminating poverty. A 2°Crise will lead to a 30% reduction in agriculture and the disappearance of 90% of the glaciers of the Andes mountain range. According to this scenario, even if global carbon dioxide production were to stop at current levels, temperatures will still rise by 1.5°C. As a result, 1.2 billion out of the 7 billion people in the world will fall into extreme poverty from which they will not be able to extricate themselves. The world is currently at war with climate change. This issue was apparent even at the September 2013 UN Climate Summit. The final decision is to come up with a price of carbon that is inducing such climate change. All this time, carbon dioxide was thought to be inevitable for economic growth, and producing carbon dioxide was free. Nevertheless,the 2014 World Bank proposal at the UN Climate Summit resulted in an agreement among 73 countries and 1,000 large-scale organizations to invest in efforts to reduce climate change. As part of an anti-climate change measure, the heads of governments agreed on a price for carbon. On this day, a very important announcement was made: “Whether rich or poor, there is no country that is immune to disasters resulting from climate change.” The matter that the World Bank is dealing with at the momentconcerns the UN, 73 nations, and 1,000 organizations only, but will become an even largerissuethereafter. The World Bank states the following: “Economic growth will run into many obstacles, as it shows no consideration for the environment and climate change. In addition, the poverty issue that stems from the food crisis, the water crisis, drought, and flooding disasters, which are all due to climate change, will become even more difficult to solve.” III. Obstacles to Resolving Poverty and Environmental Issues 1. The Dilemma of International Food Investment Abnormal temperatures due to climate change are related to the global food crisis. According to Suk-ho Han, a member of the Korean Rural Economics Institute, international food prices have fluctuated in 7-8- or 10-year intervals in the past, but after 2008, the intervals have been falling to 3.2- or 1-year increments. The most serious cause for this is climate change. In this situation, the land exploitation issue of developing countries arose due to the land lease problem of these nations and capitalists’ efforts to obtain international food bases. On November 21st and 23rd, 2008, Reuter News Agency and Time Magazine criticized capitalists for exploiting the lands of the poorest countries. Daewoo Logistics reported that it was in the midst of negotiations to lease 13,000 km2 of arable land for 99 years in the Republic of Madagascar. That land is 1.2 times the area of the Southern GyeongsangProvinceand half the area of the whole country of Belgium. Two-thirds of this land was to be used for corn production and one-third for biofuel. At the time, Daewoo Logistics said that it would use uncultivated land for Korean food security, but the international community’s reaction was one of indifference. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, this piece of land is half the size of Madagascar’s arable land. This plan was said to be a way for Korea, a country that lacks arable land but is the third biggest importer of corn, to bring to its nation crops grown in a poor country, such as Madagascar. In addition, at the time, as a result of increasing climate change and desertification, citizens of several nations have not been able to pay the cost of food. Seventy percent of Madagascar’s population of 20 million belong to income groups below the poverty line, so the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) is giving out free lunches to children in the country. Daewoo Logistics has been criticized for taking away what little food that Madagascar has and bringing it to Korea. An English organization called Sun Biofuels, which has produced food and biofuel in Africa; the Swiss organization, Nestle, and other agricultural businesses in Europe, the Middle East, and China have been criticized for exploiting Africa’s land and food resources. African organizations are protesting development opportunities. For example, millions of African farmers cannot farm effectively and cannot put out their produce in the market due to a lack of money for fertilizers, basic farming tools, fuel, and transportation equipment. Therefore, the government of this developing country has petitioned for international organizations to help develop Africa and give some financial aid to the farmers. With the change in the Madagascar presidency in 2009, the contract with Daewoo Logistics is falling apart and stirring up a new controversy. Is this a Land Grab or a Development Opportunity? Let us examine the background of this political and ethical controversy. According to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) report, due to climate change, 120,000 km2—1.2 times that of Korea—of arable and grazing land undergoes desertification and becomes useless every year. In addition, agriculture and nomadism-related losses from desertification exceed $42 billion every year, and 2.1 billion people from 110 countries are directly affected. According to UN statistics, the global population will reach 9 billion by the year 2050 and to support this many people, the present area of arable and grazing land will have to grow by at least 100%. The problem is not issues that will happen in the coming years, but that these processes are going on currently. In 2008 when Daewoo Logistics invested in corn, wheat, and beans, prices rose by almost 100%. According to the Korea Rural Economic Institute, the prices of wheat, corn, beans, and rice rose by 86%, 125%, 123%, and 232% respectively from June 2006 to April 2008. Large-scale organizations are reacting to the predicted impending food crisis for the following reasons: agricultural profits due to rapidly rising food prices and the sudden increase in demand for biofuel as a substitute for fossil fuel. Even if oil prices drop like they have recently, the World Bank is not supporting the development of fossil fuels and is instead investing in clean energy development. Considering the responses of the international community regarding climate change, this action will be profitable in the long-term. Thus, it is natural from a capitalistic point of view that large capital funds try to obtain large quantities of international land to grow crops for biofuel. Yet the problem arises elsewhere. Land exploitation that the press has emphasized so much may be just one part of a complicated situation. Amid the controversy about organizations’ land exploitation, the FAO has done more in-depth research, the results of which were published in the May 25, 2009 report titled “Land Grab or Development Opportunity?” Through this report, important information has been disclosed. To summarize: While international organizations were borrowing land from poor countries, the organizations and the relevant governments created a very simple contract regarding the responsibility of those organizations in investment, infrastructure development, and employment. Organizations want profitable and marketable land, but the problem is that although those lands are occupied by citizens, there are large swathes of land that are not registered with the government. As a result, collaboration between international investors and the regions will lead to dispute. The many countries that want to invest in land are not equipped to collaborate with and respect the rights of the citizens in the area by protecting their livelihood and welfare. The report reveals that a transaction between a recipient country and an investing organization contributes to the decline of the recipient government, exclusion of the citizens, and deterioration of the environment. The reality is that in the end, current large-scale organizations’ food investment is exacerbating, rather than improving, the issues of poverty and the environment.

Afforestation “Asian Forest of Hope” combats climate change, desertification and yellow dust: 450,000 trees planted in 450ha – Empowering locals by training them inafforestation and agriculture practices -Creating jobs and developing a self-reliant community model Green Asia Network carries out afforestation projects in Mongolia, specifically targeting areas damaged by climate change and desertification. As indigenous trees, including fruit trees, are adapted to dry climates, we’ve created a sustainable community development model through the cultivation of fruit trees and cash crops with help from various Mongolian and Korean partners. Along with these forestry projects, we have also built eco-villages, conducted sustainable land management training and launched an environmental campaign. *Project models 1) Baganuur (Since 2002) – City model Achievements: Forestation(100,000 trees), creation of an urban park, environmental education and cultural exchange programs 2) Bayannuur (Since 2007) – Steppe model Achievements: Forestation(150,000 trees), lake and water resource restoration, self-reliance model development, operation of a tree nursery, establishment of a cooperative association, construction of a Ger library 3) Dondgovi (Since 2009) – Barren land model Achievements: Forestation(60,000 trees), part of the “Mongolian National Greenbelt Project”, development of citizen-government cooperation model 4) Erden (Since 2010) – Steppe(Publicity) Model Achievements: Forestation(50,000 trees), migration of eco-refugees, establishment of “sky village” 2. Building an Eco-Village with Eco refugees – Build a sustainable development model with the three pillars of environmental, economic and social development – Pursue self-reliance through local residents’ participation and capacity building – Reorganize the local task group into a cooperative association – Innovate technically and economically on the cultivation of fruit trees and cash crops – Build a long-term infrastructure for the community fund for local self-reliance Climate change and desertification in Mongolia have been exacerbated not only by the reduction of grassland but also by severe winters called dzud. In 2002, nearly ten millionherd animals died leaving twelve thousand herders in poverty. In 2009~2010, thedzudkilled approximately eight million herd animals(one fifth of the entire herd population in Mongolia) and produced twenty thousand eco refugees. Sixty percent of the herders who lost their homes and livelihood were forced to live below the national poverty line with no electricity or water in urban ghettos. From the lessons learned, Green Asia Network has implemented a plan since 2000 to improve the living conditions of areas affected by climate change.This plan is to be embedded in any anti-desertification plans and has been called ‘Making a sustainable Eco-village.’ It entails, in terms of addressing economic self-reliance, the creation of 150 jobs in afforestation, fruit tree planting, and cash crop production. In order to achieve greater social development, Green Asia Network continues to operate an agro-forestry training school, develop a producers’ cooperative and ensure that local sales shopsare operated by members of the cooperative 3. Be Green Eco-tour: volunteering Eco-tour participants recognize the seriousness and damage brought on by climate change and desertification. They dig wells and plant and manage trees as part of anexperienceto feel a new sense of nature and culture. During the program, attendants think about the causes of the environmental crisis and try to find alternatives. They also study the global challenges and achievements of visiting international organizations. Green Asia Network’s Eco-tour has two principles; ‘Labor is a pleasant education’ and ‘Sharing’. Through the Eco-tour program participants learn to respect their global village neighbors and to become global citizens. 4. Policy Research & Environmental Education – Propose vision for sustainable development and consultation for combating climate change – Analyze internal and external climate change policy trends and agenda – ESD(Education for Sustainable Development) implementation – Develop manual and framework for climate change adaptation and mitigation -Develop educational program, such as ‘Children’s Participatory Environmental Play’ 5. Activities for climate change response with local residents of Myanmar Using its accumulated experience in climate mitigation and adaptation, Green Asia Network promotes projectsthat encourage ‘Community participation in forestry and builds eco-villages’. Half of Myanmar’s population (30 million) is affected by environmental crisis, such as climate change and desertification. In May 2008, Cyclone Nargis killed over 138,000 people, and conditions only worsened from the drought and desertification in the Central Dry Zone (Sagaing, Mandalay, and Magway which occupies 12.8% of Myanmar and equals 87,200㎢ out of 670,000㎢), which continues to expand rapidly. We focus on climate change response and the development of local people’s self-reliance to address both the environmental crisis and poverty. In March 2013, we dispatched our staff to conduct research, including a field survey and a feasibility test for future projects in the area. After this initial preparation, we establishedGreen Asia Network Myanmar in Yangon. We also formed relationships with the Myanmar government, regional governments, experts from various sectors, activists, and residents for future collaboration and cooperation. Through these activities and our projects, such as community forestry and eco-villages in Myanmar, we are closer to realizing our vision of creating an Asia safe from climate change.

Over the past 16 years, Green Asia has beenresponding to climate change through climate mitigation and adaption initiatives and poverty reduction activities in those areas hit hardest by environmental devastation. Since 2000, Green Asia Network has been engaged in developing sustainable villages to address local land degradation in Mongolia and Northeast Asia. These projects include combating desertification through afforestation projects and ecosystem conservation, promoting economic development and social integration, building ecological villages and sustainable communities, providing environmental education, conducting policy research and advocacy, and sharing knowledge and practices. In 2013, Green Asia Network opened an office in Myanmar to respond to the intensifying threat of natural disasters and desertificationin the region. This is a natural progression in Green Asia Network’s grand vision of bringing together the civil societies of South Korea and Asia to create “TerrAsia”, an international platform for public and private entities, international organizations and other various stakeholders to share, cooperate and collaborate on addressing climate change. Vision: An Asia safe from climate change. Mission: To bring people together to lead sustainable lives in harmony with nature Core value: Harmony –We live and work in balance with the environment.

Linda Lancaster on May 19, 2017 Brought to you by PepsiCo Recycle Rally Download free resources to encourage recycling in your school, plus participate for chances to win cash and prizes! Learn more about Recycle Rally here. It’s always a good time to go green. I’ve been a teacher, in both elementary and middle school, for more than 20 years and teaching my students about the environment has always been something I’ve done. Over the years, my students have created a bird sanctuary, helped to save the monarch butterfly population, implemented a lunch composting program, increased school recycling efforts, and more. Here are my suggested steps to start a green club at your school. Just add students! STEP 1: Identify a cause and start small. It can be tempting to start a green club without a lot of direction or projects in mind. But I recommend identifying a project (like building a butterfly garden) or cause (like increasing recycling) first. This will not only help give your students a focus, but it will show parents and administrators that this isn’t just some passing club that meets occasionally. You have goals, plans, and projects. STEP 2: Embrace the survey process. Part of creating a good club is eliciting feedback from those around you. Members of your green club might already know about sustainability, recycling, and the environment. Use their knowledge. Anytime my students start a new project, I encourage them to put together a survey (you can use free online tools like Survey Monkey) for fellow students and teachers to fill out. You can use this data to help guide your efforts. STEP 3: Recruit school and community members. You never know where you’ll find support when you’re planning to start a green club. When my students created a bird sanctuary a few years ago, we received all sorts of donations of bird feeders, seed, and other items just by asking local businesses. Don’t be afraid to identify your needs very clearly and then ask around about who might be able to help. Even if you’re having a fundraiser for a project, spread the word and ask for support. STEP 4: Stay motivated and don’t go off task. It’s so easy to get sidetracked by other projects you want to do, but try not to let it happen to your green club. Have students keep notes along the way so you can always go back and identify additional projects for future initiatives. But don’t let these sidetrack the current project. Also, keep your meetings and updates regular, even if there is not much to report on—it will help everyone stay on track. STEP 5: Spread the word and share your progress. This one is so important. Don’t forget to document your progress and share it with others. Social media, a school newsletter, or a website can be great for this. And don’t overlook your local community newspaper! You might even consider putting a video together—a slideshow with photos counts. Another idea is to make educational posters or put up facts about the project you’re doing to raise awareness around school. All of this will help show others what you’re doing and make your students feel really proud of their efforts. STEP 6: Celebrate. Once you’ve completed your main project, don’t forget to celebrate. Throw a party, have a dedication, or recognize members of your group in some way. I like to let my students do a final presentation to other students about what they did and learned. I love seeing how proud they are for taking ownership of a project and succeeding! STEP 7: Pick a new project, and let the magic of green continue. Take time to celebrate your accomplishments, then keep going!  Connecting with an established year-round program, such as PepsiCo Recycle Rally, can be a good way to keep the ideas and motivation coming throughout the year. Or perhaps you can get an admin or community member involved in helping to identify the next initiative. The best green clubs keep doing work and spreading the word. Then more people will want to get involved and help grow the efforts. For additional ideas about how to start a green club, check out this thorough Green Team Startup Guide.

125,"GreenClub Home About Projects Team Login Sign Up Our Projects GreenClub partners with various sustainable organizations in order to offset 1 ton of carbon emissions per month, per member. These partner programs offer ways to offset carbon that are also ethical and cost-effective. What is a carbon offset? Carbon Offsets: Carbon offsets allow you to indirectly counteract your personal carbon footprint. They are created when verified projects capture, avoid, or destroy greenhouse gas emissions. By purchasing carbon offsets, you mitigate your own carbon footprint by funding the reduction of carbon emissions elsewhere. Your carbon footprint: Everyone has a carbon footprint! Our everyday activities such as charging a laptop, driving a car, and eating food all produce greenhouse gas emissions. The total sum of resultant greenhouse gas emissions from your actions is your carbon footprint. Current Projects 3 Degrees September 2020 - Present The current project GreenClub supports is 3Degrees, an umbrella organization for a wide range of carbon offset efforts within the renewable energy industry. These offsets are generated by a variety of practices including wind energy, HFC emissions reduction, landfill gas capture, reforestation, and more. 3Degrees demonstrates just how far-ranging the carbon offsetting industry can be. To learn more, click here to visit the 3Degrees website. Past Projects & Initatives GreenTrees April 2019 - August 2020 Since our launch in 2019, GreenClub’s partnership with GreenTrees has been an effective, nature-based approach to offset carbon emissions. GreenTrees is the largest reforestation effort in the US, and data from the number of trees they plant translates to carbon credits- a tangible way to measure the amount of carbon offset by the trees. The benefits of reforestation go much farther than carbon offsets: reforestation aids in the recovery and preservation of entire ecosystems. All reforestation efforts from GreenTrees are within the Mississippi Alluvial Valley, or “America’s Amazon.” To learn more, click here to visit the GreenTrees website. Green Worker Cooperatives June 2020 There can be no sustainability without social justice. In the light of national turmoil over police brutality and systemic racism, the GreenClub team was compelled to do its part. For the month of June 2020, GreenClub allocated monthly subscriptions towards Green Workers Cooperative (GWC), an organization in South Bronx, NY focused on combating environmental racism. With its mission of building, growing, and sustaining worker-owned green businesses to create a strong, local, and democratic economy rooted in racial and gender equality, GWC unites minorities and immigrants of all backgrounds and identities to advance sustainability. Although GWC does not provide verified carbon offsets, they and similar initiatives play a key role in creating a greener future. To learn more, click here to visit the Green Worker Cooperatives website. National Forest Foundation Earth Day 2020: April 22 This past Earth Day, GreenClub partnered with the National Forest Foundation to plant trees, a simple way to reduce the amount of carbon in the atmosphere while preventing soil erosion, restoring damage from wildfires, providing habitats for wildlife, and creating beautiful scenery. The reforestation projects that The National Forest Foundation funds are all US-based and are located in protected areas. All donations during this campaign were matched 1:1 by the NFF.

That’s too far, With the high berms on the sides of the fairways one cannot get a good distance reading if you have to leave the fairway that far out. Also, and this is personal too me, I,ve had several knee operations, and getting off the fairway that far out creates more walking than I can easily handle. 50 yards I can understand, but 100 is too much, Conditions Excellent Value Excellent Layout Excellent Friendliness Excellent Pace Average Amenities Good Helpful (0) Not Helpful (0) Comment Share Report iteeup Played On 05/31/2021 Reviews 2 Skill Intermediate Plays Once a week I Recommend This Course 5.0 Verified Purchaser First Time Playing I will play it again First time playing. They have some serious bunkers and moguls to contend with, should you stray too far off the faraway. Overall, the course was in good shape. It’s a long course. If you are a big tee shot and second shot type of player, the course may not present a challenge, but has just enough distance for 230-250 yard crowd. It was fun and I would like to play it again.

I noticed the ponds at The Green were very low and looked like they were only 1/4 full. There were certainly some dry, hard-packed areas on the fringe of some greens (not too many), and around the paths leading into the fairways. But the fairways were in good shape, as were the bunkers. Additionally, the bunkers were manicured and edged nicely. The greens showed no signs of aeration (earlier reviews) and they were extremely fast with some tough reads. The only area which really showed the need for TLC were the tee boxes...they were almost bare of grass. I love the layout of this course, the mounding bordering so many of the fairways, and the ""forest"" feel (no houses on the course). The staff are always welcoming and helpful as well.

Membership Photos Our Climate Change Delegations Email us at greeneconomicsinstitutetrust.org Our Recent Delegation to COP22 and our Climate Debrief Conference in London November 21st 2016 We are delighted to report about our largest ever team at the COP 22 United Nations Climate Conferencein Marakesh, Morocco. We are greatful to our participants much luck in negotiating a binding deal which preserves our climate at 1.5 degrees, suggests Carbon rationing at 2 tonnes of carbon for every person on the planet, and is legally binding on all nations. This will help stop the march of dangerous climate change. Our team this time was composed of: Miriam Kennet: Climate scientist and economist, Editor of the world first Green Academic Journal, The International Journal of Green Economics. Author of many books and papers. Member of the Environmental Change Institute, University of Oxford, Chair of its COP21 Paris climate science panel, Green Business Award from Luxembourg Ministry of Trade, 100 most powerful global women One world action. Editor of several publications on migration and on climate change. Part of The Foreign Office's Green Caribbean leaders 2030 initiative. Michelle S Gale de Oliveira: (USA and Brazil): Director, human rights law specialist -economist- international relations Michael Shipley:: Biologist and Policy Maker, Ecology, policy methodology and implementation. Methodology Susan Shipley:: Health implications, drought/flood policies, impacts on indigenous people& activities Jack Easton: :Auditor, accountant, tax specialist, advisor on economics and investment for change Natalie Bennett:: (UK and Australasia) Agricultural Scientist, Media Specialist and recent Leader of the Greens GPEW Councillor David Williams: :Oxford County Council, Green Cities specialist and China UK business expert Allison Williams:: Artist in Residence. Trade Unions Rose Bridger :specialist in aviation and land grab and author of The Plane Truth Hend Ahmed : (Egypt) Professional Economics Researcher and Author of our book on climate change and renewables in Egypt and the MENA region. They worked to implement our Climate Change policies : Disaster: We are now at 404 ppm CO2! The world has not experienced such high levels for 700,000 years. Ration our personal C02 use to two tonnes of carbon each. Limit climate change to 1.5 degrees of warming NOW. Potential Global warming warning today of 7 degrees & sea levels are rising enough to start wiping out many countries, coastlines, small island states, & our entire civilisation in this century. Most major cities are situated by water, sea or rivers. More and more flooding, inland cities are already struggling to provide enough water for citizens and droughts, flash floods and extreme events are already coming. Health effects, (heart attacks) pollution, half of all species and animals on earth are being wiped out at the moment. Fish in the seas we take for granted all face extinction, coral reefs, and the list goes on. Refugee and migration crisis has only just started. Mass displacement of human populations are already very evident. It will become much, much worse as many of the world's regions turn too hot to grow food or to survive the blistering temperatures. Scientists are extremely worried that no current methodology is making the grade politically to stop runaway climate change. We need action now! Acknowledge climate refugees and the role of climate change in today's political landslides, tsunamis and crises. Reduce demand for energy, decarbonisation and an immediate switch to renewables and removing the perverse incentives to continue to use fossil fuels. Governments to chose now to move to 1.5 degrees implementation NOW- Not in the future. Each person to have a carbon ration of 2 tonnes of carbon- No embedded carbon in products being moved around the world.. Make it legally binding. We need a more equitable sustainable fairer economy, working within the bounds of nature for all people everywhere, nature, other species, the planet & its systems. Support our standing delegations to the United Nations COP Climate Conferences We work tirelessly to stop runaway climate change and have a regular COP delegation. Our teams comprise some of the world's best climate scientists, Nobel Prize winners & climate experts. The UNFCC Climate Change COP Conferences are a really important democratic coming together of voices from all over the globe. This matters: Inclusion is the only way we can combat climate change. The vulnerable suffer more climate change effects. More women and children were killed in New Orleans for example. We therefore support COP. Much of the damage done to the climate is due to economics excuses and so together climate scientists, policy makers and economists must tackle and remove vested interests & perverse incentives and shift the world's economy to a more sustainable trajectory. Global, united, urgent & determined COP. We would like to invite you to join us this year, and participate in the global transformation - The reformation of economics for a fairer world. The Post Oil Economy for Social Justice. Staving off disaster. We will be looking at the mess of the global economy, the need for social and environmental justice and we will also be understanding how runaway climate change has caused a mass global migration of plants, insects, mammals and people and how the media is simply not covering it and people are afraid to voice the fact that they are all being affected by climate change-as is the economy. This disaster is unfolding in front of all of us and no one is speaking about it. Lobbing a few bombs simply wont stop it. More fracking and nuclear power stations simply wont stop it. We need to work together with our diminishing habitable land and stop runnaway climate change getting any worse.

All About us and what we do The Green Economics Institute is the worlds leading Think Tank and Development Incubator for Green Economics and the Green Economy. By this we mean Social and Environmental Justice and the economics of caring,sharing and supporting each other. We have already transformed economics and effected a Renaissance. For us Economics is based on the Greek word "" oikia"" or household management, NOT greed, profit, bonuses and powerful people pushing to the front. We think economics and the economy would be far more efficient and long lasting if it was more equal and more beneficial for all people everywhere, especially women, nature, the planet and its systems. Our COP21 UNFCC Climate Change Delegation We are delighted to report that we had a delegation to COP21 in Paris. There were 10 people in our team plus four official delegates, including the inventor of the Carbon Market, Professor Graciela Chichilnisky and Professor Peter Yang of the USA and China a specialist in Energy Policy and advisor to the governments. Both are accomplished authors of many books. Most recently Professor Yang has produced- Rolling Back the Tide of Climate Change- energy policies in the USA and China - out this week, and Renewables are Getting Cheaper- out next week. The rest of the team will consist of Michelle Gale D'Oliveira (Brazil and USA) author of many books and papers, and a specialist in Gender and in Human Rights Law. Accompanying us will be a further 10 people from all backgrounds Offical Side Event Hosted by Our CEO Miriam Kennet We hosted an official side event in the COP venue with Oxford University and several Ministers from all over the world and additionally, one unofficial side event and we also ran an exhibition stall in the COP21 Venue jointly with the Amazon Fund and the Brazilian Government. If youd like to join us or help us to attend COP22 in Marakesh please email greeneconomicsinstitute@yahoo.com and we will be pleased to hear from you. Introduction to Green Economics and What we do and Why we do it We see a lack of progress or realism in the world economy with bankrupt ideas and hopelessly outdated models solving problems for rich people which are from yesteryear. We work at the cutting edge of todays 21st century challenges in Alternative Economics, under a Heterodox Umbrella but also in Science, we regard ourselves as Scientists as we keep a totally Real World Perspective in our Economics. We use stats and maths to understand the Real World and its ecology. Not to fabricate meaningless and boring formula dreamt up by people who have never worked in the real world and who have no scientific background or understanding about sustainability and the physical aspects of the world. All our team are interdisciplinarily and pluralist in their training and many are Professors or doers and some are Nobel Prize Winners. They all have a vision above and beyond the every day but based firmly on practical foundations, we make change for ordinary people -of which most people including ourselves are. We dont think we should be creating an economy for the elite and those who already have alot or far too much to consume. We think we should be creating an economy for everyone to share and have a healthy and pleasant life with enough to eat, freedom to express themselves and their thoughts, so long as they dont hurt others, and with safe and clean air, water and soil. With a free life long education and a health care system free at the point of use and a decent public transport system and jobs which are meaningful and satisfying and linked to community improvement not just profit for greedy shareholders. We seek to do things differently and we have a huge suppporter base in our quest. We believe that neo classical and neo liberal economics, has had its day, and is now causing mahem world wide. We know that production needs to be locallised again, that meaningless globalisation -wizing useless things around the world is the cause of untold slavery, misery, exploitation and pollution and climate change and is hollowing out whole economies of countries and now entire regions of the globe.Far from creating jobs, it is actually decimating them wholesale. Its time to stop and to start to encourage local economic progress and production. Its above all time to get the Supply Chains Real, stop the bullying, stop the bribery, stop the corruption which now seems to be endemic everywhere as systems struggle to scroll down into the detail of global payments, food supply and activity which is so vast that no one not even bankers have the faintest clue what they are working with or selling. Its time to stop and to re-educate ourselves.Buyers and Procurement Specialists need to rethink the mess they have created and stop taking the easy way out. The whole world does not need to source everything in Chinese slave factories. Its not fair on the Chinese and its hollowing out other economies. All the larger companies need to start paying the fair rate of tax, and paying decent wages for decent jobs- Hall of Shame this month is Apple. We urgently want to hear how they will be repairing the cruelty and hurt they have caused their workers, and the shame they have brought on their users. Young and old alike need to take stock, find out what disasters have been done in their name, check everytime they buy something- if its daft like a small item from half way round the world- go to the shop keeper and complain and ask them to stock local produce for local needs, local jobs for local people whereever sensible. Revive local economies, look after homeless people in our own community, and for parents and teachers to give a sense of leadership and vision. People need to learn the art of leadership and everyone can be a leader in something that they are proud of no matter how small. We need to encourage respect for everyone in our community and start sharing the planet and its bounty fast before its too late- make a New Years Resolution for change- no matter how small - cut your own carbon footprint by 10 more per cent, go and help in a homeless centre, start a little local busines, help someone else every day. Make yourself feel good in this way- This we call Green Economics! Caring, sharing and supporting each other, reforming economics, reclaiming it for all of us, not just the rich and powerful few. We work tirelessly to implement change at all levels. We have won many awards for our work and our ideas are used around the globe. We work with ordinary people, but our work is studied, read and admired by governments, kings and princes as well.

Our previous Annual Green Economics Institute Conference on U Tube Introducing the Green Economics Institute: Chatting on U Tube Green Economics launched in India at Shillong Institute of Management Launch of Green Economics in India August 7th and 8th 2014, Green Economics Conference and matching Green Economics Institute's Book-Green Economics in India:The Economics Miracle Green Economics is one of the fastest growing global movements for change which has been taken up by many governments and NGOs and is having a huge influence on the worldwide social and economic landscape. It seeks to reform the very concept of economics itself by creating an entirely new discipline which is designed to help all people everywhere, prevent poverty as a given assumption, consider other species, nature and the planet and its systems. Green Economics is for all people everywhere, nature, other species, the planet and its systems as beneficiaries- not just as throw away imputs to a mainstream economy. Its for everyone and everything on the planet. The climate has started to change and is more unstable. Human civilisation has built up over the last 10,000 years since the last ice age. If we mess with the climate that nutured us and our way of life- we enter unknown waters and we have no roadmap to guide us. In an age of rising sea levels we are in danger of drifting way out of our confort zone. We think we should be trying to halt further runnaway climate change, rather than increasing its velocity. About the Green Economics Institute Bridging the gap between the technology, output and culture from the old economy to the philosophy and production modes of economies of the 21st and 22nd centuries: dont miss out on our ground breaking activities and innovations! Miriam Kennet and Ben Armstrong-Haworth our Management team members at the House of Commons. The Green Economics Institute has been spreading ideas of reform and a Renaissance in Economics and is leading thinking in this new global transformation. We are now an international network of 15000 people, and we aim to change the world through this revolutionary way of thinking: Green Economics. We are achieving this by running lectures, organising conferences, briefing governments, teaching and educating and of course writing and publishing our own books and journals. The 21st century has marked an incredibly new and powerful age of Global Transformation-the Age of Green Economics. The Green Economics Institute works to change government policy and to implement their vision of a world where economics is changed and reclaimed for all people everywhere, especially women, minorities, and less able people, and people whose voice is not normally heard. It has been about fairness since the beginning. It works to include gender equality as a major part of this as 70% of the worlds poor are women and also it works in all sorts of countries to help people to realise their own voice. Members of our global network works as equals with mutual respect. Aims of the Green Economics Institute 1. We aim to create a new discipline in economics called ""Green Economics"" 2. We aim to create a climate where the reform of mainstream economics seems natural and the right thing everyone wants to do 3. We aim to put social and environmental justice at the heart of economics and financial practice, policy and theory 4. We aim to create a Renaissance in Economics -unpicking economics theory and text book assumptions to enable change to happen in the real world and the real economy 5 We aim to build a global network of Change Makers who can make this happen 6 Our network is diverse, and colourful and representative of ordinary people. We believe this is the future. Our network is gender balanced and we want economics and finance to start being like this everywhere 7. We want to stop runnaway dangerous climate change and instability and to advise people to start calculating their own carbon and reducing it 8 We want to stop the current 6 th ever mass extinction of species and halt biodiversity loss, we need other species and we dont want to be alone on this planet. We know the economy wont work without other species. We want to educate people about this 9 Our network is inclusive and includes people with special needs and we value everyone- not just the greatest happiness of the greatest number- we believe everyone and everything on the planet matters.We dont scramble over the voiceless to get to power- we include everyone who wants to make a positive contribution. We want to prevent poverty- not just to offer solutions to cure it.Therefore we work on the causes of poverty and the powerful interests that create "" haves"" and "" have nots "" and we try to unravell this. 10 Many of our network come from humble backgrounds and have had challenges and personal struggles in their lives of all kinds- we believe this makes them richer thinkers and we value that insight that each person brings. We aim to transform the lives of our network members and also of others with whom we come into contact. In Reforming Economics and Finance and also to create a climate where economics and the economy create a much nicer and more inclusive world, where caring, sharing and supporting each other is the norm and accepted as the way to be.We work to create social and environmental justice together. We are not satisfied with mitigating the effects We exist to create a framework for a complete change in the way we do things and the rationale and philosophy and structure of the economy. We are credited with creating the academic discipline of Green Economics and now we are busy implementing these ideas around the world and influencing the debate, policy makers, governments and the worlds shapers and movers. Our Trust exists to provide education in this field. We work through our international Institute, we are a registered Book Publisher and we have founded a unique academic Journal now in its 11th year. We are also an Educational Institute and College and a leading international network of Innovators in all aspects of Green issues.We are a great place to study and we publish a new kind of open source book with lots of voices from all around the world. We are involved in all aspects of change from Research right through to implementing practical and applied change. We also have speakers, lecturers and tutors available and we provide training courses and education in settings all around the world. We run regular and frequent conferences all around the world and often hold them at Oxford University.

Our Aims Our aim is to reclaim economics, for all people everywhere, especially women and minorities, nature, other species, the planet and its systems, all underpinned by developing the complex mesh social and environmental justice together. It is to invent and to promote green economics as a new discipline and discourse. It is to promote the ideas of social and environmental justice as being two halves of the same idea- you cant have one without the other. It is intensely practical. Phase one was about spreading the idea around the planet which has largely been achieved, phase two is about implementation, including such ideas as democracy, innovation, green procurement, green IT, changes to transport, changes to distribution, changes to the entire way we do things. Changes to green solutions so they are completely inclusive of everyone and everything on the planet. Its about recognising that we are all connected and that we need each other and we need other species and we need the planets systems which we are all part of. In this recession and downturn its about understanding how to work together for a bright, healthy progressive and positive future for our species which lasts and which is fun and exciting and which works to help everyone especially those who don't have a voice on the planet. Its about managing our own impacts, our own economics needs and our own responsibilities. Everyone and everything on the planet has needs, responsibilities and impacts. We need to ensure they can all happen together to benefit each other, not just using the economy and others as throw away imputs to a faceless uncaring economy but as a positive global force for changing the way we do things - for the better for every person, every species, every system on the planet.! The major stumbling block to this in the 20th century was the rise of the changed idea of economics- as a faceless exclusive alienating tool The idea of the 21st century is a complete about turn - so that the economy and economics enhances all our lives and our existence on the planet as a force for good, even a high tech and accessible future for everyone and with everyone involved. We do this using progressive and beneficial economics. We named this -green economics. The economics of equality, equity and sharing ! We have spread this idea right round the globe and we are now consolidating it and implelementing it. Join us today and enjoy being part of the fastest growing movement around the planet! For a really exciting and visionary future! What is Green Economics? An age of global transformation- An age of Green Economics Green Economics positions economics within a very long-term, earth-wide, holistic context of reality as a part of nature in the longer term and as a blueprint for 21st century economics practice in the shorter term. It moves economics from an emphasis and outcome of military, sex and cars, with Fordist and Taylorist high mass consumption of the 20th century into the economy of the 21th century which has a completely new aim and objective, for provisioning for the needs of all people everywhere, other species, nature, the planet and its systems as beneficiaries rather than throwaway inputs to the ceteris paribus economy of homo economicus and ruling man and his preferences. Economics is no longer about men in business suits- arguing over supply and demand curves and models. Economics is reclaimed as something that everyone and everything on the planet practices as all have impacts and all have needs, all have responsibilities and all have spheres of impact. Economics goes back to its roots- as a discipline of household and estate management - oikia- rather than being predicated on greed, profit and price- with its joint roots in ecology. By combining economics with knowledge from the natural sciences, Economics can now incorporate a much wider, more practical, holistic, and pluralist multidisciplinary range of knowledge than other schools of economics under a heterodox umbrella. Green Economics can offer unique insights into four of the key areas ('eco', intellectual, political and moral) of today's significant and mounting problems and highlights how its novel insights provide new solutions. The development of this new branch of Economics critiques the main contradictions, deficiencies, assumptions, conventions, and inherent normative concepts found in dominant neo-classical economic thinking, which have accumulated over the past two centuries and reassessing the world undergoing social and environmental change. It develops these themes further in order to achieve simultaneous social and environmental justice, as inseparable parts of a whole. Green Economics looks for solutions that simultaneously address poverty,( one fifth of humanity), current dangerous runaway climate change and instability and ending the current mass extinction of species ( currently there is the 6th ever on earth mass extinction event going on ) within an equitable and future proofed framework. Green Economics is extremely forward thinking, long term, hi tech, futuristic, technically competent, ( many of our board have degrees in economics and Phds or other degrees in earth science or physics). Many are also literate in social science, many specialising in new ways of examining -truth and reality in both the social and physical world, using new innovative more up to date methodology. Our project is nothing less than to re-conceptualise the philosophy of economics and its and our place in the world. As such a particular aspect is to re consider the role of economic growth, the role of GDP, and the role, structure and outcomes in the real economy of production, Foreign Direct Investment, speculation, land use, construction, property, procurement, logistics and supply chains and accounting as well as IT, and computer uses and intellectual property issues. Practises we use include everything on open source, and using slow travel in our work as well as web cams, web seminars and open source publishing. We have one of the largest green websites with free up to the minute global news and information. We also believe in local production for local needs, efficiency for appropriate supply, eg milk and vegetables being produced locally, energy being produced locally where possible and SMART grids being implemented. We are also exploring higher tech solutions. However, climate change will lead to huge areas of the world being uninhabitable or unsuitable for growing food and we are committed to a sharing methodology for all of humanity - rather than a l""and, forest and food grab"" of assets by the rich and powerful. This means global solutions for global problems such as poverty and it means working much harder to prioritise the Millenium Development Goals especially the education and empowerment of women and girls. It has been suggested (McGlade) by the European Environment Agency that educating and empowering women - would alone reduce the population projection down from 9 billion to 7 billion humans. This alone would allieviate huge amounts of hardship. We advocate empowerment of women and girls and the single most important piece of work to be done in the next few years - which will have direct benefits for all of us on the planet. Men currently own 99% of the worlds assets and this patriarchy and accumulation needs to be urgently rebalanced into a more sharing and caring economics practis.Most of the worlds poor are women and many women are poor. Poverty is a highly gendered situation. Many of the main victims of aids HIV today are women and many of the main victims of disasters from the Tsunami and other natural disasters are women being poorer and often more directly dependent on the natural world. Women are still dying in huge numbers in pregnancy and child birth all over the world. There were more slaves, mainly women, in the 20th century than ever before- far from eradication of slavery - it is thriving and has a very gendered aspect and needs urgent re- abolition - this time for good! Green Economics has also been termed -The economics of sharing -so it addresses now forms of distribution and also the economics of doing- as it is now a major player in many governments around the world, in the race to become green and to use Green Economics and the green economy as the one ray of hope in ending the current economics downturn and setting trends for 21st century economics and provisioning over the century for the needs of all people everywhere, other species, nature the planet and its systems and in fact provisioning for the comfortable survivability of the human and other species. Governments all over the world are falling over themselves to understand this programme and message- do ensure you don't loose out! It aims to innovate in methodology of economics, theory and practice making economics acessible for everyone. We are actively changing the culture of homo economicus and making economics broader and more socially and environmentally just.Our Sustainable Development Economics courses include robust, lively and enjoyable training in development and in women's economics, environmental change and social justice. We do this using participatory methodology. We want to transform economics to enable it to provision for the needs of all people everywhere, nature, other species, the planet and its systems.We want economics to benefit these groups rather than being throw away inputs in the service of faceless policies. ""We're now on the threshold of a global transformation- the age of green economics"" Ban Ki-Moon General Secretary of the United Nations. The Green Economics Institute advises governments around the world and provides advise about dealing with the current crises in economics, climate and biodiversity as well as poverty and inequality. We help people future proof their economics with an eye on weathering the current economics downturn and laying the foundations of future sustainable prosperity for themselves and their family, their company or their country. 10 Key Values of Green Economics 1.	To provision for the needs all people everywhere, other species, nature, the planet and its systems, all as beneficiaries of economics transactions, not as one-off inputs. 2.	To reinforce an underpinning of social and environmental justice, tolerance and no prejudice and creating quality of life for everyone, including current and all future generations, and regardless of age. 3.	To ensure the recognition and respect of other species' rights. To end the current mass extinction of species and ensure the survival of Earth's biodiversity. 4.	To create an economic system which advances non-violence and the inclusion of all people everywhere, regardless of special needs or special ability. To ensure that all nations have equal access to power and resources on a finite planet, and that local people to have control over their own destiny and resources. To eradicate poverty, increase life expectancy, human welfare and real well-being in the least developed countries. 5.	To guarantee gender equity in all activities, educating, respecting, empowering women and minorities, and ensuring that all people valued and respected equally. 6.	To end high mass consumption and the current overshoot of Earth's resources, returning human civilisation to the comfortable bounds of nature in its original climatic conditions. To choose lifestyle change over techno-fixes and eco-technology, lowering individual carbon usage, living lightly on the earth. 7.	Changing how economics is done: from being an abstract mathematical exercise to embracing the real world we all live in, recognizing that we are all concerned as stakeholders. 8.	Climate change prevention, adaptation, mitigation. Protecting the most vulnerable from risk. Ensuring the future of small island states. Quickly reducing carbon per capita globally to 2 tonnes in the next 5 years and zero soon after. Limiting and reversing climate change. Moving to renewable energy sources. 9.	Future-proofing economics to increase its suitability for the 21st century, solving the current economic downturn and widespread uncertainty. Creating and nurturing an economy based on sharing, rather than greed and profit. 10.	Completely reshaping and reforming economics to do all the above.

We have lectured at the Oxford University European Affairs society on gender and its importance, and have also taught the staff at GCHQ about the importance of this issue for global security. We were published in the New Scientist, in an article about the importance of gender arguing that this is the single most important issue for the future. We are also working with women around the world in many different countries to change the global economics representation. We were part of a delegation to No 11 Downing Street in the UK to speak to the chancellor and we spoke in the Treasury about Green Economics. Enrolling trainees and Erasmus Plus Trainees and Work Experience and Publishing Trainees and all sorts of writers NOW Democracy We think the House of Commons should be full of Common People- NOT the aristocracy We are delighted that a commoner has become Royalty.This is a very good thing. We urge people to vote for representation and MPs in the House of Commons, who are ordinary people like themselves and therefore who can represent their interests -NOT just a load of old Etonians and land owners and aristocrats who cant possibly understand every day worries and who think its acceptable to have food banks and homeless people sleeping in the streets all over England. We feel very strongly that any economy that allows for people to be desperate enough for food banks is a failing economy NOT a successful one - and as a result our main office activity this year has been in the Homeless Charity Launchpad in Reading. We urge readers to vote for change in the Government of England -in this election and to vote for social and environmental justice - NOT greed and selfishness We are a peaceful organisation As a non violent organisation, we utterly condem any form of violence and we sincerely wish for a speedy, non violent, peaceful outcome where no one is harmed at all.

This year it seems the tiny seedling we had created and nutured of ""Green Economics"" has come of age and is nearly 15 years old and so has entered its adolescence. Hence there are fascinating tensions between the claims for it of corporations who are wanting to use it to carry on with business as usual, and campaigners who want to use it to change the world and to solve contemporary problems- namely- runnaway climate change, population and equality and empowerment of women, minorities and people with dissabilities and special needs and inclusion, and also the problems of the 6th ever mass extinction of species, and the terrible economics downturn. The East and Asia have also adopted a ""green economics narrative"" largely taking the environmental out of our "" social and environmental narrative"" whilst the west has adopted the social- (countries like Norway) but still kept the oil addiction and not yet really embraced the environmental bit.Most countries are still running business as usual banking and economics but all are putting a toe in the water of green economics.

(Read more about our work.) By this we mean Social and Environmental Justice and the economics of caring, sharing and supporting each other. We have already transformed economics and effected a Renaissance. For us, ""economics"" is based on the Greek word "" oikia"" or household management, NOT greed, profit, bonuses and powerful people pushing to the front. We think economics and the economy would be far more efficient and long lasting if it were more equal and more beneficial for all people everywhere, especially women, nature, the planet and its systems. We are transforming economics to provision for all people everywhere, other species, nature, the planet, and its systems. How do we create change? Through our publishing house's 100+ books, our academic journal, research, campaigning, consulting, international speaking, events, education, and our international membership network, we are challenging perspectives, shaping dialogue, and influencing policy around the world. Learn more about the Aims of the Green Economics Institute and join our global green economics community.

Introduction to Green Economics - What we do and Why we do it We see a lack of progress or realism in the world economy with bankrupt ideas and hopelessly utdated models solving problems for rich people which are from yesteryear. We work at the cutting edge of todays 21st century challenges in Alternative Economics, under a Heterodox Umbrella but also in Science, we regard ourselves as Scientists as we keep a totally Real World Perspective in our Economics. We use stats and maths to understand the Real World and its ecology. Not to fabricate meaningless and boring formula dreamt up by people who have never worked in the real world and who have no scientific background or understanding about sustainability and the physical aspects of the world. All our team are interdisciplinarily and pluralist in their training and many are Professors or doers and some are Nobel Prize Winners. They all have a vision above and beyond the every day but based firmly on practical foundations, we make change for ordinary people -of which most people including ourselves are. We dont think we should be creating an economy for the elite and those who already have alot or far too much to consume. We think we should be creating an economy for everyone to share and have a healthy and pleasant life with enough to eat, freedom to express themselves and their thoughts, so long as they dont hurt others, and with safe and clean air, water and soil. With a free life long education and a health care system free at the point of use and a decent public transport system and jobs which are meaningful and satisfying and linked to community improvement not just profit for greedy shareholders. We seek to do things differently and we have a huge supporter base in our quest. ​ We believe that neo classical and neo liberal economics, has had its day, and is now causing mayhem world wide. We know that production needs to be locallised again, that meaningless globalisation -wizing useless things around the world is the cause of untold slavery, misery, exploitation and pollution and climate change and is hollowing out whole economies of countries and now entire regions of the globe. Far from creating jobs, it is actually decimating them wholesale. Its time to stop and to start to encourage local economic progress and production. Its above all time to get the Supply Chains Real, stop the bullying, stop the bribery, stop the corruption which now seems to be endemic everywhere as systems struggle to scroll down into the detail of global payments, food supply and activity which is so vast that no one not even bankers have the faintest clue what they are working with or selling. Its time to stop and to re-educate ourselves.Buyers and Procurement Specialists need to rethink the mess they have created and stop taking the easy way out. The whole world does not need to source everything in Chinese slave factories. Its not fair on the Chinese and its hollowing out other economies. All the larger companies need to start paying the fair rate of tax, and paying decent wages for decent jobs. We urgently want to hear how they will be repairing the cruelty and hurt they have caused their workers, and the shame they have brought on their users. Young and old alike need to take stock, find out what disasters have been done in their name, check everytime they buy something- if its daft like a small item from half way round the world- go to the shop keeper and complain and ask them to stock local produce for local needs, local jobs for local people whereever sensible.  Revive local economies, look after homeless people in our own community, and for parents and teachers to give a sense of leadership and vision. People need to learn the art of leadership and everyone can be a leader in something that they are proud of no matter how small. We need to encourage respect for everyone in our community and start sharing the planet and its bounty fast before its too late- make a New Years Resolution for change- no matter how small - cut your own carbon footprint by 10 more per cent, go and help in a homeless centre, start a little local busines, help someone else every day. Make yourself feel good in this way- This we call Green Economics! Caring, sharing and supporting each other, reforming economics, reclaiming it for all of us, not just the rich and powerful few. We work tirelessly to implement change at all levels. We have won many awards for our work and our ideas are used around the globe. We work with ordinary people, but our work is studied, read and admired by governments, kings and princes as well. Our leadership role has been acknowledged and invitations received from all sorts of quarters, including The United Nations, the National Government School, the Cabinet Office, the EU, and most recently the Luxembourg Government. We have run several events in the House of Commons. Our work has been published all over the world including in the Havard Economics Magazine and the Trecanni in Italy and many other places. We have our own Academic Journals. We have world class speakers on many topics related to social and environmental justice We publish books and Research Reports, and hold academic and policy conferences usually in Oxford and elsewhere around the world. Each year we have a programme for new Innovators and people come and study with us to learn about our unique methodology, future visioning and ideas. We run regular conferences and fund raising events to ensure our change making is as effective as any on the planet. If you would like to know more or to participate in our work or our events please contact us. This year we have a very lively programme of events - all designed to create waves of change in the world and in the economy. If you would like to help with our campaign for a Change in Economics both in practice, policy and in Universities - get in touch with us now and tell us about your own vision for a better future and we will show you how you can help create a real alternative in the world. You can contact us by emailing greeneconomicsinstitute@yahoo.com or calling + 44 (0) 7990 590463 Students We are currently recruiting students, study placements, fellowships and interns.

It is linked to, but independent of, other European Green actors such as the European Green Party and Greens–European Free Alliance. Contents 1 Mission 2 Structure 3 Directors 4 Notes 5 External links Mission[edit] The Green European Foundation (GEF) was founded in 2008. Modelled on many successful national Green political foundations, the mission of GEF is to encourage European citizens to participate in European political discussions and to ultimately forge a stronger, more participative European democracy. The Green European Foundation organises debates, conducts research and publishes various documents concerning green politics. Though its main office is based in Brussels, GEF aims to reach out to people across Europe and in 2018 it organised 69 events in 17 different European countries.[2] These events included conferences, seminars, workshops and summer schools that aimed to promote study and debate, and provide opportunities for capacity-building and networking. To this end, GEF also runs training sessions for young people under its annual European Green Activists Training scheme, as well as providing free courses on its online educational platform Green Learning.[3] The Green European Foundation produces an editorially independent publication, the Green European Journal.[4] Launched in 2012, the Green European Journal publishes in print and online articles and interviews on current affairs in Europe and general topics of significance to the European green movement.[5] Structure[edit] Three stakeholders are at the heart of the Green European Foundation: national Green political foundations around Europe; the European Green Party; the Green/EFA Group in the European Parliament; These stakeholders are represented in GEF's General Assembly, which meets on a biannual basis and which has the responsibility of electing the foundation's board. As of January 2019, the following national foundations are represented in the General Assembly as full members:[6] Alexander Langer Foundation (Italy) Bureau de Helling (the Netherlands) Cogito (Sweden) EcoPolis (Hungary) Etopia (Wallonia, Belgium) Fondation de l'Ecologie Politique (France) Fundacion EQUO (Spain) Green Economics Institute (UK) Green Foundation Ireland (Ireland) Gréng Steftung (Luxembourg) Grüne Bildungswerkstatt (Austria) Heinrich Böll Stiftung (Germany)[7] Nous Horitzons (Catalonia, Spain) Oikos social-economical think tank and magazine) [nl], Belgium) ViSiLi (Finland) The following are associate members: Federation of Young European Greens (FYEG - Europe-wide) Greek Green Institute (Greece) Green Thought Association (Turkey) Insamlingsstiftelsen Green Forum (Sweden) Institute for Political Ecology (Croatia) Fundacja Strefa Zieleni (Poland) Directors[edit] GEF's current directors (as of October 2019) are:[8] Klára Berg Teo Comet Dirk Holemans (Co-President) Vedran Horvat Benoit Monange Susanne Rieger (Co-President) Ewa Sufin-Jacquemart Sevil Turan Notes[edit] ^ ""Registered Foundations"".

There are certainly great differences between the Korean environmental movement that began a decade before the Chinese environmental NGO community emerged—one striking difference is that the Korean green organizations have been much more protest and anti-industry oriented than any of their Chinese counterparts. Chinese and Korean environmental movements do, however, have some commonalities—today environmental activists in both countries appear to be searching for a clear mission for the future and the means to strengthen their influence in the political sphere. For more in-depth information on the Chinese NGO movement, see the Wilson Center's Green NGO and Environmental Journalist Forum.By Yon-ho Kim (Atlantic Council)The environmental movement in Korea is characterized by grassroots activists seeking to influence policy and challenge powerful polluting industries. In response to the environmental degradation caused by South Korea's high-speed industrialization, small anti-pollution groups arose in the early 1980s. In the 1990s as more ""green"" groups emerged, Korean environmental activists created larger umbrella organizations to empower themselves.This meeting held at the Wilson Center and cosponsored by the Atlantic Council's Program on Korea in Transition brought Korean environmental activists together to discuss the strength of the environmental movement in South Korea and the challenges they face in carrying out their work. The discussion also addressed the broader role of green organizations and other civic groups in Korea and their potential influence in the upcoming elections. Fighting Development Forces and Raising Public AwarenessSeo Wang-jin started his remarks with an introduction of his organization, Citizen Movement for Environmental Justice (CMEJ). In 1999, Mr. Seo founded the CMEJ, which has since become one of Korea's fastest growing NGOs focusing on environmental justice and the fair distribution of national resources. The group's activities have concentrated on promoting children's environmental rights and stemming the environmental degradation from large-scale construction projects initiated by the government. In describing the trends of the South Korean environmental movement, Mr. Seo pointed out his and other groups fight against the construction of dams, housing complexes, canals, and reclamation projects. Since the 1960s these projects have been a stronghold of development-oriented bureaucracies—the Ministry of Construction and Transportation and Ministry of Agriculture—and government contracted private engineering and construction companies. Although there is not a desperate need for many of these large-scale construction projects, the government and business development-oriented ""forces"" keep pursuing the projects to serve vested interests. Mr. Seo noted, however, that growing concern for the environment in Korea has lead to severe frictions between these forces and environmental civic groups. The campaign to save Dong River on Korea's east coast from dam construction in 1999 is an excellent example of this hostility. The government emphasized the necessity and importance of the project due to water shortages made worse by a short rainy season in that area of the country. The green civic groups opposed the project because the ecology in the Dong River area was exceptionally well preserved. Moreover, such a large-scale dam could threaten the safety of surrounding communities. Seo explained that the efforts of several civic groups to educate and mobilize citizens through the news media led President Kim Dae Jung to announced the cancellation of the project on World Environment Day in June 2000. The Dong River case proved to be a major turning point for the Korean environmental civic group movement, for it was one of the first times they succeeded in such a large public awareness and mobilization campaign. The case also illustrated the changing political environment in which sustainable development issues rose to the level where the Korean president became directly involved. While the Dong River case was a battle environmental civic groups won, the Saemankeum wetland case was one they clearly lost. Despite protests, the Ministry of Agriculture proceeded with a large-scale reclamation project in Korea's southwest region, claiming the project would create 28,300 hectares of farmland. Farmland is a major concern, for 30,000 hectares of agricultural land disappear every year in Korea due to changes in land use. Despite the need for agricultural land, environmental civic groups pointed out that the Saemankeum area is one of the world's five most ecologically important mudflats and a crucial feeding ground for migratory birds. In 2001, the government decided to go ahead with the controversial project with strong support from the local government and residents who were seeking economic development benefits from the project. With growing public awareness and strong vested interests of the development-oriented forces, conflicts over large-scale government-initiated construction projects should become even more pronounced and receive a greater amount of attention from the Korean public. In an effort to redirect government policies, Korean environmental civic groups are planning to influence the next administration's organization of the cabinet following its inauguration in February 2003.Political Activism of Korean Green GroupsIn 1994, Kim Je-nam joined Green Korea United (GKU), the second largest environmental NGO in Korea, which acts as an umbrella organization for many smaller green groups. In her work Ms. Kim coordinates every NGO's stance on currently debated environmental issues, mediates agreements among environmental NGOs, government agencies, and businesses, as well as informs the Korean President on the outcomes of these dialogues. Ms. Kim described GKU an example of environmental NGOs working at the intersection of environmental and political issues. Among this NGO's major activities is the environmental monitoring of U.S. military bases in Korea—GKU has collected data on noise, water, and soil pollution problems, which the Korean government has not previously tracked. Last year GKU exposed an incident in which Yongsan Base, located in the heart of Seoul, illegally discharged toxic chemicals into a river. As a result of GKU's publicizing of the pollution, the commander of U.S. Forces Korea apologized publicly for the illegal discharge—the first apology of its kind in fifty years of U.S. military presence in Korea.GKU and other green groups have been involved in drafting laws and trying to influence legislation in the National Assembly. Such work is particularly challenging for most environmentalists believe the Kim Dae Jung government's ""vision"" is insufficient to protect natural resources. One positive action did occur in 2000 when the Kim government formed a ""sustainable development committee,"" which brought together industry, government, and environmental group leaders for consultations. The Korean environmental ministry now holds these consultations four times per year with twenty leading green NGOs, but the committee is perceived to be a weak force within the government.In addition to policy efforts and environmental campaigns directed at the national government, Korean environmental civic groups are involved in various grassroots political activities. For example, the Civil Action for the 2000 General Election (CAGE)—consisting of 423 civil organizations (including a number of green groups)—successfully launched a ""blacklist"" campaign in 2000. The blacklist campaign was established to single out politicians they felt were ""not qualified to run"" due to positions on environmental and social issues. Of 86 blacklisted candidates, more than 60 percent failed to win their election. In the upcoming 2002 local elections, environmental civic groups are planning to politicize green forces even further by establishing a Green Party and supporting green candidates—ostensibly creating a ""white list"" rather than a black list campaign.While working locally is central to Korean environmental activists, Ms. Kim noted that their contacts with international organizations grew considerably in the late 1990s, due in part to the openness that accompanied the Kim Dae Jung government when NGOs were legalized and their political participation sanctioned. Ms. Kim also discussed how environmental degradation in North Korea is an increasingly important issue for the South Korean green movement, which supports current government efforts to plant trees in North Korea and protect the environment surrounding the DMZ. She believes the South Korean groups could best help the North by advocating the provision of small-scale, renewable technologies for industry. One challenge for such work, however, is the current lack of NGO counterparts in North Korea.Korean green civic groups undertake activities beyond the environmental sphere. In fact, Ms. Kim noted that Korean environmental groups are sometimes criticized for being ""department store"" advocacy groups, because they attempt to address a large number of issues both within and outside the environmental sphere. While Ms. Kim agreed that Korean environmental NGOs need more focused missions, she was a strong supporter of how active some green groups are in the anti-war and peace movement. Some green groups joined other civic groups in the anti-war movement at the onset of the war in Afghanistan. Kim expressed the Korean civic groups' hope of seeing the Korean peninsula become part of an ""axis of peace"" as opposed to an ""axis of evil."" Civic Groups and Korean DemocratizationIn a brief review of the role of environmental groups in the Korean democracy movement, Stephen Costello noted the connection between a lack of democratic institutions and environmental degradation that can be found in Russia, China, Eastern Europe, and other one-party states in transition. In Korea, the authoritarian structure and rapid industrialization of recent decades have created similar environmental problems as are occurring in other one-party states. As the Korean government now becomes more accountable and more responsive to interest groups—on all sides of environmental questions—the civic leadership must try to organize and set priorities. The ""department store"" advocacy noted by Kim may serve to weaken the movement. Effective policy advocacy will also rely to a great extent on dialogue with the government and industry groups. How such a dialogue is conducted will often make the difference between having influence and just blowing off steam.Added to this is the question of ""green"" involvement in party politics. As Ms. Kim Jae-nam noted, some Korean green groups do not want to become direct participants in the political system and instead wish to rely on public participation and support for their power and legitimacy. Costello noted, however, that the formation of a Green Party and the participation of individual activist leaders as candidates in other parties will be an essential element in keeping these issues on the public agenda in Korea.

Cheongoksan, Pyeongchang-gun, Gangwon-do, South Korea, July 2020. The Green New Deal focuses on renewable energy, green infrastructure and industrial sector. Photo Photo: Stock for you/Shutterstock.com Author Sarwat Chowdhury Policy Specialist, UNDP Seoul Policy Centre In 2021, the COVID-19 crisis still looms large. Many countries are experiencing a third surge of the pandemic. The surges and new strains of COVID, with their continued impact on the overall political economy and society mean the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals are at stake. The need for a well-coordinated and holistic global response and recovery is urgent. The Green New Deal idea goes back to the New Deal of former US President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Journalist Thomas Friedman is often credited for first calling for a Green New Deal in 2007. By that time, it was becoming clear that the challenge of climate change will require a comprehensive approach, and there was no politically expedient silver bullet. A Green New Deal combines Roosevelt's government-led, society-wide economic approach of Great Depression era with modern technologies that will shift economies to low carbon. While the combined health, economic and social impact of COVID crises exacerbate the existing climate and nature emergency, it also offers an opportunity for a smart recovery with a wide-reaching, fundamental restructuring of critical sectors. It makes economic sense to plan green recovery packages and for the transition to be socially inclusive, low-emission and climate-resilient. This year could be crucial for an inclusive global, green recovery that focuses on renewable energy, green jobs, and ensures social protection for the most vulnerable. The Korean New Deal The South Korean government has responded. It’s New Deal, plans to invest about US$144 billion in creating 1,901,000 jobs by 2025. The plan focuses on a Digital New Deal and Green New Deal, and includes overarching policy support to strengthen employment and social safety nets. Korea has identified ten key projects ranging from green mobility to smart healthcare. It includes the central and local governments' involvement to bring innovation and jobs to the regional economy, with half of the money invested outside Seoul. The Green New Deal focuses on renewable energy, green infrastructure and industrial sector. Its green car subsidy programme offers up to US$17 million in subsidies to people buying electric cars in 2021 and up to US$33.5 million for hydrogen fuel-cell electric vehicles. In December 2020, South Korea submitted to the UNFCCC its NDC and 2050 Carbon Neutral Strategy. The latter includes Korea's long-term strategy for achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. COVID-19 challenges While Korea has generally been able to respond effectively to COVID-19 with rigorous contact-tracing and other preparations, there have been successive surges in the pandemic. Almost 79,000 South Koreans were infected, and more than 1,400 have died. The government plans to offer free vaccinations to its citizens from now on. Korea’s economy managed to stay open through most of the pandemic. Still, many people, including small businesses, and the self-employed suffered from the economic downturn. With the New Deal moving forward, the government aims to support a post-recovery economic resurgence called ""inclusive recovery and takeoff"". This will include continuing with stimulus packages to small businesses and individuals. In March, the government will launch the five-year K-New Deal Fund, seeking to invest US$3.5 trillion in 2021, with 35 percent financed by the public sector and 65 percent being raised privately. Way forward Korea remains the world's fourth-largest importer of coal and the third-largest investor in overseas coal projects. As its 2050 Carbon Neutral Strategy highlights phasing out all coal plants or converting them to liquefied natural gas by 2050, Korea requires a drastic acceleration of clean technology. The next few months will be exciting. The New Deal's three-pronged model will be led by the private sector and backed by the government and it has generated high interest. Korea has exceptional IT infrastructure and digital competitiveness. It is increasingly recognized as a world leader in research and development, with a sophisticated consumer base pushing technology innovation and partnerships, such as the, UNDP and Samsung Global Goals initative. International companies are exploring the New Deal's key projects to identify market entry and expansion opportunities. Developing countries want to learn from the policy lessons on Korea’s recovery. At the Seoul Global Policy Centre, UNDP has facilitated policy deliberations on green recovery under the Build Back Better webinar series. In May and Dec 2020, we organized two webinars with experts from Korea, Rwanda, Bangladesh and the EU. The discussions covered lessons on green recovery and emphasized the need to maintain momentum. Our latest technical webinar, organized with Korea Ministry of Foreign Affairs, included participants from 43 countries. This year, we will continue to highlight and share the various aspects of Korea’s Green Recovery and New Deal with partners around the world.

152,"A New Chapter in U.S.-South Korea Relations: Seoul Embraces a Broader Role in Asia - Center for American Progress src=""https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=2804137903007331&ev=PageView&noscript=1"" /> DONATE ESP ISSUES EXPERTS EVENTS PRESS ABOUT DONATE FACEBOOK TWITTER INSTAGRAM TUMBLR YOUTUBE ESP Trending: American Rescue Plan Coronavirus Biden Administration Voting Rights Ending White Supremacist Violence Foreign Policy and Security A New Chapter in U.S.-South Korea Relations: Seoul Embraces a Broader Role in Asia By Tobias Harris and Haneul Lee June 25, 2021, 9:00 am At a recent appearance at the Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Research Center at Stanford University, Kurt Campbell, coordinator for Indo-Pacific affairs at the National Security Council, offered a stark assessment of the U.S. relationship with China in the early days of the Biden administration. “We all acknowledge that the period that was broadly described as ‘engagement’ has come to an end,” he said. “The dominant paradigm is going to be competition.” Related 5 Priorities for the U.S.-Japan Alliance in 2021 Bridging the Divide in the U.S.-South Korea Alliance Campbell’s statement—coming only days after President Joe Biden hosted South Korean President Moon Jae-in at the White House—highlights the extent to which the U.S.-South Korea (ROK) relationship will be pulled in new directions due to the challenges posed by China’s burgeoning military and economic might, a development that was heavily implied when Biden and Moon met on May 21. The summit signaled that South Korea may be willing to work with the United States and other partners to compete with China in providing regional public goods. While domestic constraints make it unlikely that South Korea will pursue an overtly competitive policy toward China, Seoul began a new chapter in U.S.-ROK relations at the summit by embracing a broader role in regional affairs. Seoul’s new tone on China While the U.S.-ROK joint statement released after the summit did not explicitly mention China—in contrast to the U.S.-Japan joint statement released following Biden’s meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Suga Yoshihide in April, which explicitly criticized Beijing—the statement nevertheless was more sharply critical of the Chinese government’s behavior than previous such documents. In the statement, the United States and South Korea stated their opposition to “all activities that undermine, destabilize, or threaten the rules-based international order” and voiced their commitment to maintain peace and stability and defend international rules and norms in the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait. This was the first time a ROK-U.S. joint statement has included reference to Taiwan. The message was not lost on Beijing. “There was no mention of China, but it’s not that (Beijing) is unaware it is targeting China,” said Xing Haiming, China’s ambassador to South Korea after the summit. China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson predictably protested, noting that “the joint statement mentioned issues related to Taiwan. The Taiwan question is China’s internal affair” and calling on both the U.S. and South Korea to “refrain from playing with fire.” Ahead of the G-7 Summit, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi cautioned South Korea not to be trapped in a “biased” way of thinking and stated that Seoul and Beijing must maintain a “political consensus” during a conversation with his South Korean counterpart. Notwithstanding this new tone, it is unlikely that South Korea will embrace an overtly competitive approach to China in the near term. Following the Moon-Biden summit, South Korean Foreign Minister Chung Eui-yong sought to reassure Beijing that Seoul was not “interfering in China’s internal affairs.” South Korea remains heavily dependent on trade, investment, and tourism flows with China, leaving it vulnerable to another economic pressure campaign. There is also a salient intellectual current that calls for South Korea to assert its autonomy and defend its sovereignty from the United States. Countering China with a positive agenda Nevertheless, it is possible that the summit could foretell a greater willingness by South Korean officials to side with the United States and other democracies against China. Beijing’s multi-year economic pressure campaign against South Korea in opposition to the deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system forced both Korean elites and the Korean public to abandon their hopes for an ever-closer relationship with China. Opinion surveys suggest that the South Korean public has soured on China: Beijing’s favorability rating within South Korea stood at a historic low of 24 percent in 2020. In addition, a survey conducted by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs in March showed that the majority of South Koreans surveyed view China as an economic and military threat, although a lower priority threat than falling birth rates, climate change, and North Korea. These concerns have clearly given the Moon administration new space to pursue a policy of countering China’s influence in the region. In his summit with Biden, Moon effectively signed up as a partner for the new U.S. president’s emerging foreign policy doctrine. On the campaign trail, in his public remarks as president, and in joint statements with Moon, Suga, and other leaders, Biden has emphasized that the organizing principle of his foreign policy is an effort to muster the world’s democracies to overcome global challenges, in the process pushing back against attempts by China, Russia, and other authoritarian countries to expand their influence in other countries. As a vibrant, prosperous democracy with a strong industrial base, South Korea has a critical role to play in realizing this vision in Asia. Although the basic tenor of South Korea’s China policy may be modulating, Washington should not expect drastic change in the near term. If Washington continues to push Seoul to take a sharper approach on China, the U.S.-ROK alliance may become more strained. Instead, Washington must strengthen its alliances and urge its democratic partners, including Seoul, to become regional and global leaders. With the partial exception of the supply chain resilience initiative, pursuing these objectives is not explicitly about China. Rather, they amount to a bet that democracies can do more than China to support sustainable inclusive growth that respects sovereignty and human rights. By providing a positive economic and values-based agenda, Washington can advance its own vision for the region without forcing allies to pick sides. The Moon-Biden summit was a positive step in this direction. The joint statement announced the beginning of a “new chapter” in the bilateral relationship, in which the allies would look beyond the Korean Peninsula—and their security relationship—to find new opportunities for collaboration. The United States and South Korea agreed to find new ways to harmonize their signature regional initiatives—the Free and Open Indo-Pacific vision and the New Southern Policy, respectively—in pursuit of “regional coordination on law enforcement, cybersecurity, public health, and promoting a green recovery.” South Korea overcame some of its concerns about the Quad—an informal strategic dialogue that includes Australia, India, Japan, and the United States—and opened the door to cooperation in some form. More significantly, the two allies outlined an extensive package of joint projects on combating climate change and advancing decarbonization; accelerating the production and global distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and strengthening global public health institutions; and the development of “critical and emerging technologies.” The latter includes a pledge not only to collaborate in the development of next-generation network technologies, clean energy and battery storage, and artificial intelligence but also to strengthen supply chain resilience for the production of semiconductors, strategic minerals, and pharmaceuticals. With South Korea’s presidential election approaching in less than a year, it will be left to Moon’s successor to follow through on the vision outlined at his summit with Biden. However, regardless of whoever wins the next presidential election, South Korea will continue to balance its relationships with Washington and Beijing. The United States should pursue partnership mindful of Seoul’s limits. Although South Korean conservatives are traditionally open to regional security cooperation and becoming a well-established middle power, virtually no prominent conservative foreign policy experts in South Korea are calling for Seoul to openly side with the United States in an anti-China coalition. After all, it was former president Park Geun-hye’s conservative administration that focused on building stronger relations with China, a thaw that Moon continued to pursue even after the THAAD dispute. Conclusion The Moon-Biden summit is a significant landmark for the U.S.-ROK alliance and South Korean domestic politics. South Korean progressives, who have historically wanted the alliance to focus on North Korea, are becoming more open to the idea of expanding the U.S.-ROK alliance beyond the peninsula. This is a positive development in South Korea’s increasingly partisan political atmosphere, and a benefit to the United States, which has always viewed the alliance as capable of both addressing North Korea and playing a role in regional affairs. There is truly no limit on what the two allies can accomplish together in the region if there is a bipartisan consensus in South Korea that Seoul can and should play a greater role in confronting the region’s most urgent challenges in coordination with the United States and other democracies.

(image: Green Korea United) SEOUL, Nov. 26 (Korea Bizwire) — A rescue mission to free Asian black bears currently being raised for their gallbladders will kick off early next month. Green Korea United, an environmental activist group, announced its purchase of three Asian black bears, a species on the brink of extinction, held captive at a farm in Gangwon Province. The NGO plans to send two bears to a zoo in Cheongju and the other to a zoo in Jeonju. Bae Je-seon, an official at Green Korea United, said that the organization had crowd-sourced 40 million won(US$35,500) online to purchase the three bears. “After staying at various zoos, the bears will be relocated to protection facilities to be built by the National Institute of Ecology in 2020 or 2021,” said Bae. The three bears, all reportedly born in 2014, will be able to leave their cages for the first time since they were born. Before the bears are moved to zoo facilities, they will undergo a health checkup on Wednesday. The bears are known to be descended from Asian black bears that were brought to the nation following a government policy to import the animals before exporting them at higher prices. The measure was aimed at boosting farmers’ profits but ended abruptly following public outcry regarding the protection of the endangered species. The remaining bears were bred for their gallbladders. The descendants of the bears that were imported between 1981 and 1985 totaled 1,400 by the mid-2000s. In 2014, the government banned the breeding of black bears as public sentiment against the practice continued to grow. At present, only around 540 such caged bears remain. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Environment has been importing wild bears from Russia and China to release around Mt. Jiri in hopes of restoring the bears to their natural habitat, an ironic move considering the hundreds of home-bred Asian black bears across the country that are presently confined to cages. Green Korean United says it will continue to raise funds to save Asian black bears held in captivity. M. H.

They are listed as vulnerable by the IUCN. In the context of Korea, black bears are on the brink of extirpation. Reply ↓ Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Grow with confidence! ..bring out deep heat and intense flavor in peppersRezin helps to bring out deep heat and intense flavor in peppers you may have grown many times. You will notice an increase in the diversity of your fruit’s flavor profile. Superhot varieties will demonstrate more of their cinnamon or very sweet notes with a more lingering burn.Peppers have been shown to demonstrate anti-cancer properties. My thinking is that the diverse flavor of a pepper reflects a diverse chemical profile, full of phytochemicals that our bodies need. That is why they taste so fantastic, so much more with Rezin.Also, Dual Fuel works great for Strawberries!Mason Stelter I’m just finishing my first all Green Planet Run.It did a far better job than I had originally thought it would!I’ve never had plants that look so healthy all the way through, until now.

The team is based in Hangzhou, Zhejiang and their home stadium is the Hangzhou Huanglong Stadium that has a seating capacity of 52,672. The club's main investors are the Zhejiang-based Greentown China Holdings Limited company and Zhejiang Energy Group. The club was founded on January 14, 1998 named as Zhejiang Greentown F.C. and they made their debut in the third tier of China's football league pyramid in the 1999 league season. On November 23, 2000 the club bought the first team of Jilin Aodong as well as their position in the second division for 25 million Yuan. They have subsequently won promotion to the top tier after finishing runners-up in the 2006 league season and the highest position they have ever finished is fourth in the 2010 CFA Super League season. It still remains the top football club in Zhejiang.

Greentown Real Estate Company, Hangzhou Qiantang Real Estate Company, Zhejiang University and Zhejiang Provincial Football Association all participated in the creation as well as the registration of the club.[1] The company would go on to form a youth team before finally creating a senior team on January 22, 1999 to take part in the third tier with Bao Yingfu as their first head coach. They wouldn't wait long to show their ambition when they would make the play-offs in 2000 before losing to Tianjin Lifei.[2] Still determined to win promotion the club decided to buy the first team of Jilin Aodong as well as their position in Chinese Football Association Jia League on November 23, 2000 for 25,000,000 Yuan, in time for the beginning of the 2001 league season. Under the new general manager Shen Qiang the club brought in new sponsors and Gu Mingchang as the new head coach, however during this period the club couldn't win promotion to the top tier and the chairman Song Weiping expressed his disappointment of the team. Song Weiping would soon discover that the reason for his club's disappointing results when it was discovered that several of his players and coaches were taking bribes, with a 6–0 defeat against Changchun Yatai in the 2001 league season being highlighted, which saw the offending participants banned for a year while the club had three months to reform and re-apply for a CFA playing license.[3] This would see the club would go through several management changes as well as a significant ownership shift, which saw Song Weiping's company Greentown China Holdings Limited take a 96% share of the team for 20,000,000 Yuan in 2005 while Zhejiang University held on to 4%.[1] Under Wang Zheng as their head coach the team would start to generally push for promotion, eventually achieving it at the end of the 2006 league season when they came second in the division.[4] The club often found themselves fighting off relegation and would bring in several managers to alleviate the problem, however this wasn't enough during the 2009 league season and the club found themselves in the relegation zone at the end of the season. Surprisingly the club were allowed to stay within the 2010 CFA Super League after it was discovered that Chengdu Blades and Guangzhou FC were guilty of match-fixing.[5] After gaining a reprieve from relegation the club went on a spending spree by signing several established Chinese internationals such as Du Wei, Li Yan and Wang Song.[6] The signings seemed to work and the club's results significantly improved throughout the 2010 league campaign, which saw the club achieve their best ever finish of fourth and a chance to play within the AFC Champions League for the first time.[7] This club is known for its outstanding football academy and youth training facilities. However, they were relegated to the China League after getting second-to-last place in the 2016 CFA super League because of their bad performances for the season with only 8 wins in 30 games.[8] Aimed to take the crown in the football competition of 2017 National Games of China, Hangzhou Greentown adopted a risky youngster-first policy which was more radical than ever. But good wishes were all vain. In 2017, the team struggled near the relegation zone in their first season of China League while the youngsters who formed the Team Zhejiang watched the championship slip away in the final. Young trainer Xu Lei filled in manager Hong Myung-bo's shoes and the team finally ranked 9th in the league. Meanwhile, former player and veteran Jiao Fengbo also returned as the new general manager. On 14 January 2018, the club changed their name back to Zhejiang Greentown F.C. for the 20th anniversary of the club.[9] The same season they reached third place in the China League, one place away from returning to the CFA Super League. In September 2020, the team changed their name to Zhejiang Energy Greentown F.C., as Zhejiang Energy Group stepped in as one of the major share holders, while Song Weiping officially quit the club.[10] On 26 February 2021, According to the requirements of non-corporate change of club name by the Chinese Football Association, after several rounds of discussion and reported to the relevant provincial departments and the Chinese Football Association for review and approval, the club's name changed to Zhejiang Professional Football Club.[11] Name history[edit] Period Club Name First Team Name 1998-2001 Zhejiang Greentowen FC 浙江绿城 Zhejiang Greentown 浙江绿城 2001-04 Zhejiang Sanhua Greentown (Sponsor Name) 浙江三花绿城 2004-09 Zhejiang Babei Greentown (Sponsor Name) 浙江巴贝绿城 2009-10 Hangzhou Greentown FC 杭州绿城 Hangzhou Greentown 杭州绿城 2010-12 Hangzhou Nabel Greentown (Sponsor Name) 杭州诺贝尔绿城 2012-13 Hangzhou 9Top Greentown (Sponsor Name) 杭州九好绿城 2013-14 Hangzhou Daikin Greentown (Sponsor Name) 杭州大金绿城 2014-18 Hangzhou Greentown 杭州绿城 2018-20 Zhejiang Greentown FC 浙江绿城 Zhejiang Greentown 浙江绿城 2020-21 Zhejiang Energy Greentown FC 浙江能源绿城 Zhejiang Energy Greentown 浙江能源绿城 2021- Zhejiang Professional FC 浙江职业 Zhejiang 浙江 Current squad[edit] First team[edit] As of 30 July 2021[12] Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

In 2017, after being relegated to China League, Hangzhou Greentown briefly had a 2-seasons Zhejiang derby with Zhejiang Yiteng but only won 1 out of 4 matches. More often than not, Zhejiang FC has a stronger rivalry with other teams of the same level in the Wu Chinese region, such as Shanghai Zhongyuan and Shanghai Shenhua.

The center, built between 1997 and 2003, includes an association football stadium with a running track, an indoor arena, outdoor track and field practice facility, a sports hotel, a press center, and other facilities for sports such as rhythmic gymnastics, tennis, diving and chess.

The facility seats 51,000 people and was completed in 2000. It is used by the local football team and was one of the venues of the FIFA Women's World Cup 2007 held in September 2007, for group phase games and the Brazil-USA semifinal. It was referred to by FIFA as Hangzhou Dragon Stadium. The structure is circular in shape and has a partial roof covering the seating sections that is supported by two dual suspension towers on opposing ends of the stadium. Contents 1 Yellow Dragon Gymnasium 2 Notable Events 3 References 4 External links Yellow Dragon Gymnasium[edit] Yellow Dragon Gymnasium or Huanglong Gymnasium is an indoor arena seating 8,000 people, which was officially put into service on 21 September 2003. It was constructed at a cost of 160 million RMB (roughly 19 million USD).[1] The arena can accommodate figure skating and ice hockey, as well as a variety of indoor sports. It is also used for music concerts. It is adjacent to the stadium in the northeast direction. This was originally designed by Soviet experts in the 1950s and endorsed by Later Premier Zhou Enlai. When Zhou Enlai visited Hangzhou in the early 1970s, he repeated this plan to local officials.

On 8 September 2018, Joker Xue, a Chinese singer-songwriter, headlined the stadium as part of his Skyscraper World Tour. References[edit] ^ ""Stadium put into use"".

We are young professionals who have spent extensive time in the fields of climate change and sustainable development and have dedicated our work to create, facilitate, and manage youth oriented projects. GII focuses on several thematic areas, including: climate change and disaster risk reduction, climate (smart/resilient) agriculture, biodiversity conservation, youth leadership and development, and renewable energy. GII also provides consultancy on environmental and social impact assessments. Through our work, we hope to create awareness about climate mitigation and adaptation, food security, and sustainable development. In the past, we have distributed solar lamps to rural communities in Ghana, held conferences such as the National Youth Conference on Climate Change & Sustainable Development, and we have partnered with the Ako Foundation to promote youth in agriculture. Additionally, we have also created a junior wing of GII called the Greener Impact Clubs (GIC). These clubs provide students with environmental education and how to put that education to practical use. We offer support through weekly meetings, projects and activities, environmental trips, etc. Volunteering has always been the hallmark of GII, therefore we engage volunteers from diverse backgrounds and cultures with relevant experiences in the execution of our projects and programs. GII also has a Board of Directors made up of professionals in the field of environmental protection, forest conservation, food production and financial management. The Board of Directors provides technical support and establishes a framework for monitoring and evaluating the performance and financial accountability of GII’s activities. We are determined to tackle issues that are especially hard hitting in Africa and are passionate about creating awareness and opportunities for other young Africans to join us in this movement.

How will my donation make a difference? By donating to GreenFacts you are contributing to making a wide range of scientific knowledge on health and the environment accessible to a greater number of people. Access to such knowledge is vital since it will contribute to a clearer debate between different interested parties (decision-makers, journalists, health and environment stakeholders, teachers and concerned individuals) and, therefore, lead to more informed decisions, benefiting society as a whole. Why does GreenFacts need my help? GreenFacts is a non-profit organisation. Our website is free of advertisements, and our publications can be accessed entirely free of charge. However, providing this service has a cost. Hence we rely on public donations and other funding sources to maintain the quality of our service and extend the number of accessible summaries. How will my money be used? Your donations will help us face the costs of finding suitable reference documents and writing, editing, peer-reviewing and publishing their summaries. These costs are related to the normal functioning of GreenFacts, such as the indispensable IT equipment, as well as the staff costs of the editorial team and external experts who ensure that the GreenFacts' summaries are faithful to the source report and unbiased. Get involved! How can I contribute? For a small contribution each month, you ensure that we can continue to bring you quality, factual content.

Place: Washington, District of Columbia Phone Number: 1-888-778-1972 Website: ghginstitute.org/housekeeping/ References: http://ghginstitute.org/housekeeping/contact-us/ The Greenhouse Gas Management Institute (GHGMI) was founded in response to the growing demand for qualified greenhouse gas (GHG) professionals. Just as engineering and financial accounting rely on certified professionals, GHG emissions management requires a highly competent and ethical professional class to undertake measurement, reporting, auditing, and mitigation activities. The Institute has developed a technically rigorous GHG training curriculum authored by leading experts and delivered globally via an online e-learning portal and onsite workshops. The Institute’s mission is to build and support a global community of experts with the highest standards of professional practice in measuring, accounting, auditing, and managing GHG emissions. This effort is critical to ensuring that market mechanisms and policy responses to climate change are effective and credible, as well as a valuable source of new green jobs. As a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization, the Institute is training individuals and developing programs to certify professionals to meet the highest standards of expertise and ethical conduct. The Institute is for individuals and organizations, from beginners to expert practitioners, working on all aspects of climate change, including both voluntary and regulated emission markets, organizational emission inventory reporting, corporate climate risk disclosure, GHG projects for emission reductions and removal enhancements, as well as GHG assessments of supply chains, products, and technologies in various industry sectors. Educational program The Institute's courses are primarily delivered via e-learning to maximize their accessibility and scalability, whilst minimizing costs and emissions. More than 1,200 course seats have been filled by learners in over 50 countries. Currently eight courses are offered, ranging from fundamental GHG accounting frameworks to more technical courses on verification and forest carbon methodologies. Additional courses are in development to address new sectors and mitigation technologies. Financial aid and full scholarships are available to worthy applicants, especially those at non-profit organizations and from developing countries. The Institute offers courses online via e-learning, traditional workshops, and blends online learning with face-to-face workshops. The use of online learning tools has been empirically shown to achieve superior outcomes than solely traditional in-class formats. The use of a blended approach achieves the maximum learning outcomes by ensuring learners show up to a workshop already having achieved a relatively high and more uniform level understanding of the relevant topics, at a low incremental cost, thereby allowing workshop time to be used for more advanced skill building. GHGMI has a unique e-learning curriculum of the following courses that are internationally recognized by leading organizations around the world: •	101 Introduction to Climate Change (forthcoming) •	102 Introduction to Carbon Markets (in partnership with Point Carbon) •	201 Basics of Organizational GHG Accounting (in partnership with World Resources Institute) •	202 Basics of Project-Level GHG Accounting •	211 GHG Information Management Systems •	251 Corporate Climate Change Risk Disclosure (in partnership with the Carbon Disclosure Project) •	301 GHG Accounting for Forest Inventories •	302 GHG Accounting for Forest Projects •	311 GHG Accounting for Landfill Methane Projects (forthcoming) •	312 GHG Accounting for Coalmine Methane Projects •	321 GHG Accounting for Energy Efficiency Projects (forthcoming) •	331 GHG Accounting for Renewable Energy Project (forthcoming) •	351 CDM/JI: Navigating Kyoto Project Mechanisms (in partnership with the World Bank) •	401 GHG Verification for Inventories and Projects Professional Program The Institute is building the infrastructure necessary to support a new class of GHG professionals: •	Released the field's first code of ethics in 2009; •	Operates the world's first and only internationally accredited personnel certification program for GHG management professionals. •	Develops GHG accreditation and certification systems for leading GHG programs to assure the work of verifiers (auditors) and compliance reviewers (e.g., RGGI and Kyoto Protocol). GHGMI, in partnership with Environmental Careers Organization of Canada (ECO Canada), offers a groundbreaking global personnel certification program for “carbon management” professionals. The Environmental Professional Certification on Greenhouse Gases – EP(GHG) is the world’s first and only professional greenhouse gas-related certification accredited to ISO 17024 and stands as a uniquely robust, globally recognized credential. GHG Quantification. Professionals in this area quantify, assess and report GHG emissions and emissions reductions that result from the activities of organizations, entities, facilities or GHG emissions reduction projects. Their work can be categorized into two major domains: Inventory Quantification, Project Quantification. GHG Verification. Professionals in this area act as the independent party that evaluates how a GHG inventory or project has been established and/or reported against program criteria and/or a specific protocol that states expectations of greenhouse gas accounting principles. Their work can be categorized into three major domains: Quantification Expert, Auditing Expert, Team Lead. In addition to the EP(GHG), GHGMI offers the Environmental Professional in Training title – EPt(GHG). The EPt(GHG) distinction is available to emerging professionals who have satisfied EP(GHG) post-secondary education requirements but have not yet completed the extensive work experience and/or GHG training necessary to achieve the EP(GHG) certification. Both the EP(GHG) and EPt(GHG) titles are available worldwide. Further work is underway to develop a “GHG Manager” designation with a stronger focus on mitigation and implementation issues. Accreditation. The EP(GHG) designation is accredited by the Canadian national standards council to ISO 17024 – the standard for personnel certification bodies. Basing the accreditation for the global EP(GHG) program in Canada is the logical choice because Canada serves as the secretariat for all ISO 14000 standards. We also developed the accreditation system for offset project verifiers for the Regional GHG Initiative (RGGI) and the training and expert testing program for the UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol's national inventory review process. Membership Program The Institute is advancing the original work of the GHG Experts Network by further building a global community of experts and professionals with Web 2.0 online tools. The program currently has over 3,000 members in over 100 countries. Research Program The Greenhouse Gas Management Institute's Research Program conducts forward-looking independent research. Pairing the unique expert experience of its staff and faculty with the dynamism of its extensive practitioner network, the Institute's Research Program provides insight on foundational areas of climate policy and the practice of environmental management. In keeping with the Institute’s goal of supporting the development of the social infrastructure necessary to effectively implement future climate change policies at all levels (e.g., from the consumer to international treaty compliance), the Institute's Research Program operates to extend the reach of scholarly research to GHG management. Scientific inquiry is necessary to guide long-term planning and investment, with respect to the design of the GHG-related performance metrics and quality assurance systems (the foundation of GHG mitigation policies and measures). The Institute's Research Program was established to foster and catalyze inquiry through discussion papers and facilitating intelligent discourse through peer-reviewed publishing and workshops. The unifying theme of the Research Program is implementation. Whereas much of today’s research on climate change has focused on climate science (e.g., atmospheric science and impacts) or policy mechanism design issues (e.g., the economics of cap and trade), this series considers the questions that arise when attention turns to the challenge of policy implementation. The series provides an invaluable spark for what has to date been a largely silent conversation, one whose framing demands a greater imperative when viewed against a background of global society beginning to attempt to implement policy on a scale exceeding any before attempted. The Institute’s researchers and faculty are GHG measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) specialists and experts in GHG management issues who share a dynamic conviction for the importance of capacity building. The Institute is unique in the field of GHG measurement and management, arguably ahead of its time in terms of the problems it is addressing. However, it was founded to address this paucity of thought leadership and its Research Program is characterized by its commitment in investigating, confronting, and pushing these issues from the dark corners of academia and technocracy to the mainstream. Our projects include: •	The Institute's flagship research venue is Greenhouse Gas Measurement and Management, a peer-reviewed scholarly journal published by Earthscan/Tyler & Francis with an international and independent editorial board. •	The annual Greenhouse Gas and Climate Change Workforce Needs Assessment Survey. •	The consensus-based research reports from the Offset Quality Initiative, of which the Institute is a founding member. •	Discussion papers and briefing reports.

185,"Cleaner highway in store for Tibet - China - Chinadaily.com.cn US EUROPE AFRICA ASIA HOME CHINA WORLD BUSINESS LIFESTYLE CULTURE TRAVEL SPORTS OPINION REGIONAL FORUM NEWSPAPER China Daily PDF China Daily E-paper China Daily Global PDF China Daily Global E-paper China / Society Hot Issues Government Society Innovation Education Cover Story People Photos Cleaner highway in store for Tibet By By Palden Nyima and Daqiong in Lhasa, Tibet (China Daily) Updated: 2016-04-22 02:17 Comments Print Mail Large Medium Small A 420-kilometer section of highway that passes through the ecological lifeline of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau will get eight recycling centers this year in an effort to cut down on the trash and other waste that tourists leave behind on their journeys. The service stations along the Qinghai-Tibet Highway will offer waste recycling, toilets, hot water, Wi-Fi access and power outlets. An investment of 3.6 million yuan ($556,000) has been made for infrastructure construction and basic operations. ""Waste along the highway has become a hidden danger for pollution of some water resources, and it damages the pasture landscape,"" said Yang Xin, head of the Sichuan Greenriver Environmental Protection Promotion Association, the NGO that is setting up the stations. ""Moreover, animals such as sheep and yaks could die if they eat the plastic bags."" Starting in Xining in Northwest China's Qinghai province, the Qinghai-Tibet Highway is about 2,000 km long and for decades has been an important transportation channel for Tibet. A 2013 trash survey by Greenriver and the Hoh Xil National Nature Reserve found about 160,000 items along the highway between Kunlun and Thanglha mountains, and most of the refuse was non-biodegradable plastic packages tossed out by drivers and tourists. The stations will be built along a 420-kilometer section of the highway from the city of Ge'ermu to Mount Thanglha. ""We chose this section because the highway here cuts through the ecological lifeline of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and it is where the Hoh Xil National Nature Reserve and the Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve are located,"" Yang said. The toilets will be especially appreciated, Yang said, since tourists have often complained about a lack of them. The stations will be operated by volunteers who will provide visitors with ""various cute souvenirs as rewards"" for recycling and proper waste disposal, Yang said. ""It's such a smart way to raise awareness of ecological conservation,"" Yang said. Volunteers at the stations will gather, classify, compact and package trash for transportation to Ge'ermu for recycling and disposal. The Ge'ermu government and Qinghai Development and Reform Commission have offered significant support to the project, including the startup costs, Yang said. An official with Ge'ermu's Environmental Administrative and Health Office, surnamed Hou, said, ""This project is an important one, because it will not only collect the waste of the roadside residents, but also provide long-distance drivers a place for temporary rest, and a place to leave their trash."" The annual operating budget of the stations is 910,000 yuan, of which 400,000 yuan will come from the government and 510,000 yuan from Greenriver. Yang said he is confident the stations are a sustainable project. ""I have rich experience in finding volunteers, and in the next five years, we will make sure every station has at least three to five volunteers,"" he said. 0 Related Stories Nude photos in Tibet get mixed reaction Tibet to complete registering 200,000 cultural relics Xi'an Highway Port Scenery of Lhasa-Nyingchi High Grade Highway in Tibet Photo Night views of Harbin through the lens Tibetans take train home after pilgrimage or travelling World's largest shaftless Ferris wheel built in China Ancient cities to be connected by Xi'an-Chengdu high-speed railway Snow turns Harbin into winter wonderland Reed Catkin Festival held in Wuhan Society Politics Hot Topics Science/Tech Business Cover Story FTZ simplifies process to launch businesses Japan can offer experience, expat says Application for work streamlined Awareness of law aids resolution Air Force units explore new airspace Low wages and lack of respect responsible for kindergarten abuse, experts say Liu heralds UK partnership in education and research Agency ensuring natural gas supply UN envoy's trip to DPRK praised by Beijing China moves to secure natural gas supply amid rising winter demand Xi asks China, Canada to work for substantial ties Cooperation necessary for success, leaders say Living in space: How astronauts train, eat and work Teachers excused for lunchtime drinks Waiting for Shenzhou XI Cancer agent found in 44 cities' drinking water At Ikea eatery, it's no pay, no stay China lose 2-0 to Uzbekistan in World Cup qualifier, coach Gao resigns C919 gains another 55 orders, lifting total orders to 785 Services offset dip in manufacturing Fintech to energize real economy, cut risks China's Long March rockets complete 60 commercial launches Engineers achieve breakthrough China-made components add security Online shopping rings up customer complaints Import expo to focus on advanced tech SME mobile market platform receives first clients China top importer of US soybeans Air China opens direct route from Beijing to Barcelona Insurance-based trust launched Dandelion helping to sow the seeds of stability for members Cover story Visa change may boost tourism to US The wrong side of the road Building ban begins to bite Villagers call on Japan to atone for massacre Most Viewed Today's Top News Premier underlines peaceful settlement of boundary issues with India Hospitals add beds for maternity boom Chinese Academy of Sciences tops global science institutions China plans to launch core module of space station Xi urges stronger PLA Charities rebuild image through relief efforts Self-testing to boost HIV battle Study finds plummeting levels of physical activity among Chinese adults School not at fault, its principal insists Xi says advice from netizens welcome Pupils from a primacy school in Jinan walk to nearby restaurants for lunch in a rope circle.

Posted in Article, Focus. Author: Wang Weinan and Guo Yunzhe Made in China: Then and Now January—April 2021 I met Guo Yunzhe in the mid-2000s when we belonged to the same university students’ environmental protection association, Green Hope (绿色希望). I led the association before him; he took over later. Yunzhe currently works for a nongovernmental organisation (NGO) in Yunnan Province focusing on community development and environmental protection. He is also a board member of the China Youth Climate Action Network (CYCAN; 青年应对气候变化行动网络), a well-known environmental protection NGO that he was involved in founding in 2007. Yunzhe agreed to talk to me about his experience in the environmental NGO (ENGO) field over the past 10 years, during which time he has worked in different types of NGOs, starting out at our student association, going on to co-found CYCAN, a new internet-based ENGO for young people, and later moving to Green River (绿色江河), another well-known ENGO. His experience in this field is rich and, in a way, reflective of the richness and variety of the field itself. My questions for Yunzhe focused on broad trends in the ENGO sector but, during this conversation, Yunzhe sometimes disagreed with my train of thought. Instead, he answered in his own way, prompting me to think about whether sometimes, by focusing on macrolevel trends, we ignore important details. Perhaps this is particularly a problem in environmental protection because while at a macrolevel these issues will always demand global governance and cooperation, on an operational level, we need a deep understanding of specific local contexts. We might think back over the development of the ENGO field and see changes in the domestic institutional and political contexts and shifts in country-to-country relationships. Yet regardless of how things change, the need for humankind to cooperate and face environmental issues together remains. Yunzhe’s reflections suggest that some of the answers to how we do this may be found tucked away in the detail, and not in sweeping summaries of broad trends. Wang Weinan Wang Weinan: How about you start by talking about your experience of working in ENGOs. You can start from the beginning or begin with your recent work, whatever you prefer. Guo Yunzhe: Okay. I will start from the beginning. I chose to go to Minzu University to study Environmental Science as a major, and it was there that I got involved in the environmental protection students’ association where we met. I found the kinds of activities that this students’ association was doing really interesting because at that time, in Beijing, it gave us a lot of opportunities to engage with all kinds of people and groups beyond the university bubble. That year there was a Green Students’ Forum [绿色大学生论坛] and the forum organised capacity-building, arranging for core members of each university’s environmental protection association to go along. I was able to meet associations from other universities as well as some ENGOs from outside the university. I found out a lot that way. During my second year, I became the leader of our students’ association, organised different activities, and was able to engage a lot with different researchers working on the environment. At that time, climate change had just begun to gain a lot of attention, and it was a topic of debate in environmental protection circles. In 2007, we participated in an annual meeting of the Chinese University Students Environmental Organisation Cooperation Forum [中国大学生环境组织合作论坛] held in Wuhan and funded by the International Fund for China’s Environment, an American foundation. It gave us the chance to go beyond Beijing and to meet environmental organisations from all over China. The meeting in Wuhan focused on ‘global warming and university students’ environmental responsibility’. At that meeting, some of us from different universities came up with an idea. We thought: wouldn’t it be great to establish an organisation that was not limited to one specific university and that could do things a students’ association could not? That was how we started CYCAN. That was during summer vacation when I was a second-year student and, from then, right through my third year, I gradually became involved in building CYCAN and working to coordinate around the country [CYCAN is made up of groups from around China]. To begin with, our team was mostly made up of student volunteers. By the time I was in my fourth year, I had begun working for CYCAN full-time. I continued right up until I graduated and, by that time, the organisation had become more developed. At most, we had three or four full-time members of staff as well as student volunteers. For funding, we got support from some Chinese and foreign foundations. The organisation developed well and is still going today. I left at the end of 2010, and it later changed leaders a few times, but it is good to know that it is still operating today. After leaving in 2010, for a long time I was not involved in CYCAN but a couple of years ago they invited me to come back and so I re-joined them as a supervisor on the board of directors. So, I became involved in the ENGO field by working on young people’s involvement in action on climate change. But eventually I felt that I had reached a kind of bottleneck. It was partly that I felt that the topic of climate change was too abstract [虚], and partly because I felt that if I was to choose this field to work in full-time then I was lacking capacity, especially in terms of taking on management roles. Now that I think back, maybe it also had something to do with the pressure of life in Beijing. After leaving CYCAN, I came across another opportunity. Since I had been working in environmental protection circles for quite some time, I had long heard people talking about an NGO called Green River [绿色江河] and its leader, Yang Xin, who, inspired by Friends of Nature, started the NGO in 1994–95 with a group of like-minded people and a desire to set up environmental protection stations. At that time, Green River wanted to build a protection station in Qinghai Province and was looking for a project manager. I took the job and went there in the spring of 2011 and stayed for just less than two years. Green River, compared with other ENGOs, is not big. It never had more than 10 full-time employees. Compared with CYCAN, working for Green River was a very different experience. Green River was quite strongly influenced by its leader’s ideas, and it did not focus directly on climate change. Thinking back to my time at CYCAN, we were more of an advocacy-type organisation: although we did do some projects within the university, on the whole, we focused mostly on raising awareness among university students of climate change and advocating to those in positions with capacity to act. But Green River was basically rooted at the source of the Yangtze River and focused on concrete protection issues. It is registered in Sichuan Province and operates from Chengdu, but much of its work is at the source of the Yangtze in Qinghai Province. It began by building the Suonan Dajie Nature Protection Station [索南达杰自然保护站] in Kekexili, Qinghai Province. I was later involved in setting up a protection station at the Tuotuo River [Ulan Moron] and doing some rubbish collection and ecological protection projects there. I stayed at the Tuotuo River protection station for just less than two years, and my work typically involved recruiting and managing volunteers, enabling them to participate in protection work. Some of our volunteers were already environmental experts and able to contribute a lot, but for many, my job was to help them become involved and to gain experience through the process. That was a great thing; they gained a real sense that in Chinese environmental protection there was citizen-led [民间的力量] work going on, especially in some areas where ecosystems are weak or fragile and where economic development is behind other parts of the country. Then in 2013, when the Lushan earthquake [芦山地震] happened in Sichuan Province, a lot of NGOs got involved in the rescue, recovery, and reconstruction work. Among those organisations involved was The One Foundation [壹基金]. To me, it seemed that the post-earthquake reconstruction really needed nongovernmental actors involved and so I went to work for The One Foundation. I know that was quite a big shift, working on disaster recovery work, but I did that for three years. I later came to Yunnan Province, to the NGO where I work now, an NGO that tries to integrate environmental protection into community development. The organisation I am at now is called Mengnanshe [梦南社]. It originated with a foundation based in Hong Kong [the Kadoorie Charitable Foundation, 嘉道理基金会]; they have an organisation called Partnerships for Community Development [PDC; 社区伙伴]. Mengnanshe is registered in Kunming, Yunnan. The policy on foreign (including non–Chinese mainland) NGOs is such that it was better to support some of PDC’s staff to set up their own local NGO and to let that locally registered organisation develop independently. That is how Mengnanshe started out. It has been formally registered for about 18 years, and about 10 years ago it began working on community development in Blang communities in Yunnan. Students’ Associations, Young ENGOs, and an Enabling Atmosphere? WW: That is well over 10 years of working in different NGOs. I wonder whether in some ways your experiences in the mid to late 2000s might be familiar to others in our generation who were involved in NGOs and environmental protection? For example, you talked about how CYCAN came about. Can you tell me a bit more about that? GY: My involvement in NGOs began when I was a student, and I gradually went from the university into an ENGO in the city, and from there to ENGOs in different parts of the country. I was a little naive and fearless. I just thought that climate change as an issue was so connected to myself, to other young people, to society, and to the world, and so I felt a sense of mission, a sense of responsibility, and it was this that got me involved in this work. CYCAN started out as an internet-based NGO with seven organisations involved (I was not the main founder, I just worked with the others). We were quite different from a students’ association based within one single university. At first, I was involved in CEF [the Chinese University Students’ Environmental Organisation Cooperation Forum, 中国大学生环境组织合作论坛], which was one of the seven. The others included an association founded by Peking University graduate students called the Clean Development Forum [清洁发展机制研究会], and so on. Our seven organisations worked together online. There were some main members, like Fei Xiaojing from the Green Students’ Forum and Li Gen, who were both founders. At that time, I was still an undergraduate. Some were graduate students or were already working, so those with a bit more experience took leadership roles. I think I was CYCAN’s first full-time employee. Together there were three of us working full-time for a while. WW: That makes me think about the connection between civil society in the environmental protection field and university students’ associations. You and I both started out in the same students’ association, and I wonder whether you have a similar sense that back then there was a lot of engagement among students from all over the country? I feel like that really encouraged and inspired a lot of us or sparked something in us. What do you think? GY: The connection is pretty strong. I have chatted about this with other friends in environmental protection and I think a lot of us in ENGOs, and also in NGOs working in other fields, started out in university associations. But it was not every year that environmental students’ associations fed a lot of people into the field. I feel like it works in phases; I could not say when there were the most people that began working in NGOs in this way, but in my experience, there were a lot who began as undergraduates in 2005 or 2006 who started out in environmental students’ associations and went on to work in ENGOs or other NGOs. Thinking back now, that might have been influenced by a number of things. For example, there was funding from foreign foundations and also government support. Around that time (beginning in 2008), Pan Yue was Vice-Minister of Environmental Protection [Pan was an environmental journalist before working in government]. The Ministry of Environmental Protection was very supportive of associations like the China Environmental Culture Promotion Association [中国环境文化促进会] and the All-China Environment Federation [中华环保联合会]. Often that kind of organisation went about its activities with a kind of semi-official identity, and every year for their annual conference they would invite students’ environmental protection associations. At that time, they offered a lot of support to students’ associations, and they would convene meetings and organise exchanges. There was a lot of engagement, and gradually more and more discussion, planning, and opportunities for different associations to work together. At that time, the environment for organising domestic NGOs was a bit more relaxed, and the atmosphere for debate and exchange was alive and vibrant. That had a big impact on a lot of young people who back then decided what courses to follow in our own lives, what fields to work in and such. It is about 11 or 12 years since I graduated, but I heard that later in some universities, associations came to be managed more strictly, the government has been tightening up, and foreign funding has slowly dried up. WW: I agree, there was a lot of communication at that time, the atmosphere for that was great, there were a lot of chances to engage with different people on the environment, there was a lot of enthusiasm for it; it influenced young people who were involved. You mentioned several different factors: foreign funding, government support, and semi-official associations and their support—those are all important to think about. I wonder whether there is something else that was important, too—that is, the support of senior generations, earlier activists involved in citizen-led environmental protection initiatives? I am thinking, for example, of initiatives like Green Camp [大学生绿色营], which was started by environmentalist Tang Xiyang in 1996. GY: Right, Green Camp had a big influence. When I was in my first and second years of undergraduate studies in 2005 and 2006, Green Camp was developing fast. It had activities going on all over the country and all kinds of camps. I did not get to join one of the camps myself, but I was involved in exchanges with Green Camps going on in different regions. I remember there was the Jixi Forum [济溪论坛, a Bulletin Board System forum], where people interested in environmental protection would post and debate. There were those forums like Green Camp where earlier activists like Tang Xiyang and those involved in founding Friends of Nature [自然之友] would engage with and support young people. Some people, even if they did not make careers in this field, were still interested in it, and they continued to show concern, support, and engage. This was all a great help to the field. WW: I remember some regional networks or federations of NGOs were quite active and maybe that was another thing that supported the development of ENGOs. Was that the case in your experience? GY: At that time, a number of regional networks were forming, and a large part of the funding for some came from the Global Greengrants Fund (GGF), an American foundation, though it was not a huge foundation. Back then, they had a member working for them called Wen Bo. He was involved in setting up the Greenpeace office in China. When he was involved, he managed to fund a lot of young people active in environmental associations to work full-time on their development. They had one way of funding that enabled people in different areas to directly spend funds on buying or renting office space. That meant that groups had a space to operate from and, for young people from across an area or region, those spaces could act as a kind of public space for them to come together and communicate. I remember that at the time there were spaces set up that way in Beijing, Shanghai, Hefei, Lanzhou, Xinjiang, Ha’erbin, and Guangzhou. Although I do not have the data to hand, I know that those spaces were quite influential. That kind of funding was quite directly involved in supporting the development of some environmental organisations, like Green Stone [绿石环境保护中心] in Jiangsu Province, which focuses on industrial pollution; Green Camel Bell [绿驼铃] in Gansu Province, which works on environmental protection in western China; and Green Anhui [绿满江淮], which works on public education and policy advocacy. The GGF played a kind of angel investor role for those groups. WW: That period had a big impact on the development of civil society. It influenced organisations and individuals, including you and I. Those were pretty exciting times. Citizen-Led Protection at Green River WW: Can you tell me more about the next stage of your own experience? You moved from CYCAN to work for Green River. How did they differ? Were Green River’s operating model and way of working different? GY: It was quite different. Also, when I started at the protection station, it was different to my expectation. To begin with, I was not directly involved in a lot of protection work but instead was mainly developing processes for participation. I did a lot of managing volunteers and coordinating their participation, which was a bit like my work at CYCAN. But at CYCAN I was working with university students. At the protection station, there were all kinds of volunteers—members of society interested in environmental protection. Another difference was that out there at the protection station, it was at the source of the Yangtze River, and that area really made people feel attached. There is something about that kind of area, like the Qinghai Plateau. While the living conditions are not so good, since they were involved in something meaningful there, most of our volunteers left there with a real sense of attachment to the place. That continues to have a lasting impact on them, and on their attitude towards environmental protection, their awareness, and behaviour. There were other similarities. For example, different types of NGOs were all mainly foundations dependent on funding to survive and develop. But at Green River, when Yang Xin wanted to set up his first protection station, his first sum of money came from the royalties from his book The Soul of the Yangtze: Diaries of Drifting on the Yangtze River [长江魂一个探险家的长江漂流日记]. Of course, after that he also applied for funding from Chinese and foreign foundations, and within China there was support from organisations like Friends of Nature. Green River differed from other ENGOs that relied more on funding from foundations. It always derived part of its funding from its founder’s activities as a photographer, an explorer on the Yangtze, and other things; through this, he was able to draw on broad and diverse social resources, so Green River’s funds did not come just from the environmental protection field. Related to this, Green River’s projects were not so limited by funders. That is not to say it was not limited at all, but that it was relatively autonomous. In this respect, when it came to autonomy, Yang Xin was quite forward thinking. For example, when he thought something was worth doing, even when it was still unlikely that a foundation would fund it, he would persevere working in this direction, make an impact to show for it, and then retrospectively apply for an award that enabled the organisation to gain some funds and influence. That helped the organisation’s development. That was something different about Green River compared with a lot of other ENGOs. Meeting a Bottleneck WW: Something else interesting comes out of this: your experience seems to reflect the broader changes in the agenda and discourse in the environmental protection field. Would you agree? GY: I have heard people discussing some kind of ‘change in discourse’ but I am not convinced that it is true of my experience. Whether we are talking about individuals or organisations, our development is influenced by an array of different factors. Who knows which factors are most prominent? But when it comes to the development of a whole social group, on the one hand, we are influenced by the context of the times we live in, and on the other, the orientating influence of funding stands out. It might be that for a period funding is oriented towards one particular issue. WW: Let me go back to something you mentioned when talking about your move from CYCAN to Green River. You said that after working for a few years at CYCAN you felt you had reached a kind of ‘bottleneck’. Can you explain that? GY: That does relate to the agenda in environmental protection. In around 2009 or 2010, there was more debate over climate change; of course, that was around the time of the UN Copenhagen summit on climate change. The thing that had the biggest impact was that I had originally understood climate change as an environmental issue, but the deeper I got into related debates, the more I came to realise that this was not just an environmental issue at all. The summit involved a lot of politics, relating to how different countries were developing, and to economics, and in terms of the environment itself there was still a lot of debate. When we were working on issues related to climate change, as young people, we were participating in and coming to understand something about public affairs. It helped us to become global citizens with an international perspective and, in that way, participating was a positive thing. But I started to think that maybe this topic was quite different to my original understanding and hopes when I first became involved in the students’ association. At that time, I felt a lot of confusion. So, when I talked about coming to a bottleneck, I meant that when I got deeper into these debates, I felt like I was fine talking about the general, surface-level issues, but when it came to those deeper, more complex issues, I felt unable to explain this clearly for other people. Also, in terms of developing as an organisation or as an individual, the agenda now has already changed, and China is much more actively talking about its commitment to ‘peak carbon emissions’ and pursuing ‘carbon neutrality’. At that time, there were already some among us talking about these topics, about how to solve carbon emissions; there were a lot of technical debates going on. For CYCAN, this also presented some opportunities, but we were limited by the nature of our organisation. We were more involved in university student advocacy activities. At the time, when we had the option of getting involved in some more concrete work, to get involved in some of the cutting-edge technologies and so on, we had to decide whether or not to develop in this direction. That kind of thing seemed outside the scope of what we were able to manage. From a management perspective, we started out as a team of student volunteers, developing towards becoming an NGO. There were also opportunities to get involved in the business sector and we had to think about whether that was something we should get involved in, whether it was where our strengths lay. That all came with some difficult decisions. In the end, I made my own decision and moved on to Green River. Future Direction: Cultural and Environmental Protection WW: What are your thoughts on the environment in which this sector exists and develops? Has it changed in ways that have had an impact on you? GY: The change in the context in which ENGOs work has changed in quite obvious ways. First, restrictions on foreign funding have had a big impact. Then there are other factors: individual activities in environmental protection and more radical methods have become less welcome. This has a big influence on the way ENGOs operate. And in terms of methods and techniques, the internet and other new tools have a big influence. WW: What are the fields you think have real potential for ENGOs? What have you been working on recently? GY: In the past few years, a clear trend in China’s environmental protection field is for NGOs to work in education about nature; a lot of new organisations are making this their focus. It is a direction that interests me, too. The NGO that I am working in now focuses on facilitating sustainable development from the perspective of the cultures of different ethnic minorities. Its past projects were also developed from a culturally informed perspective while focusing on livelihoods and local economic development. Its focus is on the notion of ‘sustainable development’. I recently developed a project that encourages communities to establish ‘community conserved areas’ [社区保护地]. The concept comes from the International Union for Conservation of Nature. But actually, in this ethnic minority area, there is already a tradition of the idea of a ‘conserved area’. They have given these areas special names, like ‘竜山’ [long shan; ‘long’ is an old character for ‘dragon’ and ‘shan’ can mean ‘mountain’ or ‘hill’], and believe them to be sacred. Local people in this area have a kind of concern for environmental protection rooted in this faith and culture. To them, this place or this area is inviolable. They will not hunt living creatures or pick plants here, and humans are not even permitted to enter some places. Due to economic development over the years, these cultures have been affected, and this tradition of protection has also felt some impact. Today, in some ethnic minority areas, protecting culture and nature are one and the same thing. That is to say that if that culture is protected, the protection of nature is a corollary of that. The project I am working on at the moment relates to this. I just mentioned that the local people have many names for these areas that they want to protect, like ‘竜山’, and traditionally they have lots of different conservation areas. A scholar named Pei Shengji at the Chinese Academy of Sciences has done a lot to study environmental protection in the traditions of different ethnic groups in China and understands the Dai and Blang ‘Long Shan’ areas to be a ‘sacred place of nature’ [自然圣境]. He has found that in the 1960s in Yunnan Province there were a great many places like this—over 1,000. Then in the 1980s and 1990s, because of the rubber industry, only a few hundred remained. This is an enormous reduction. Rubber, and now sugar cane and tea, are plants that consume a lot of water, and growing them too much in one place has a big impact on the environment. The trees here originally were cut down to grow rubber, sugar cane or tea, and then there was the use of chemical fertilisers, and this has done damage to these sacred places of nature, also impacting the ways that local people live. So, our current projects relate to the loss of local cultures and the impact on the environment and on conserving these sacred places of nature. Wang Weinan Wang Weinan worked as a research assistant at Tsinghua University’s NGO Centre and as a project manager at several small NGOs including the Philanthropy and NGO Support Centre (明德公益研究中心) in Beijing. He is currently a PhD candidate at Beijing Normal University where he is writing a dissertation on Chinese nonprofit sector evaluation, based on years of experience working for third-party NGO evaluation teams. Guo Yunzhe Guo Yunzhe has been working in the non-profit sector on environmental protection for over ten years. In the mid-2000s, while still an undergraduate, he was involved in founding China Youth Climate Action Network (CYCAN, 青年应对气候变化行动网络). Currently, he works in Yunnan Province on the protection of ethnic minority cultures and biodiversity.

Green River built an environmental conservation station on the Yangtze River. This organization also brings scholars, media sources and volunteers together to study the ecology in the Yangtze River region, discuss solutions and implement plans. Green river publishes on media platforms to promote environmental protection and raise public awareness. It also organizes seminars for communities and international philanthropists to take action. From 2001 to 2020, Green River initiated various research projects on endangered species and sustainable solutions to agricultural and fishing industries. Green River aims to reduce the amount of undecomposable trash accumulated in the Yangtze River to prevent the pollution of water sources. Since 2012, Green River has project allowing nomadic people to collect the trash in exchange for food at the environmental conservation station. In addition, Green River organizes volunteers to sort recyclable trash at the conservation station into packages and send them to designated areas. These projects form a system for trash management to reduce pollution overall. In 2013, university students are mobilized to walk more than 400 kilometers to remove plastic disposed near the highway, and collect statistics to raise awareness. From 2016-2020, Green River established 18 trash recycling sites along the Qinghai-Tibet Highway. This is a replicable model of trash collection and transportation, based on the collaboration between the government, civil society organizations and volunteers.

Formally founded in 1971,[2] Griffith opened its doors in 1975, introducing Australia's first degrees in environmental science and Asian studies. The university is named after Sir Samuel Walker Griffith, who was twice Premier of Queensland and the first Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia. Sir Samuel Griffith played a major role in the Federation of Australia and was the principal author of the Australian constitution. Opening initially with the one campus at Nathan and 451 students, the University now has five physical campuses spanning three cities, the largest of which are the Gold Coast campus at Southport and the Nathan campus in Brisbane. The Mount Gravatt and South Bank campuses are also located in Brisbane, while the Logan campus is at Meadowbrook.[3][4] In 2018, the University launched its Digital campus, now its sixth campus, which offers a range of online degrees.[5] Griffith has around 50,000 students[6] and offers a full suite of undergraduate, postgraduate and research degrees in the areas of business and government, criminology and law, education, engineering and information technology, environment, planning and architecture, health, humanities and languages, music, science and aviation, and visual and creative arts. It is a verdant university and a member of the IRU. In the 2019 Student Experience Survey, Griffith University recorded the seventh highest student satisfaction rating out of all Australian universities, and the highest student satisfaction rating out of all public Queensland universities, with an overall satisfaction rating of 82.1.[7][8] Since 2012, Griffith University has received more Australian Awards for University Teaching than any other Australian university.[9] Griffith has many distinguished alumni and academic staff, including 2017 Australian of the Year Emeritus Professor Alan Mackay-Sim.

After several months of discussion, the Queensland Government announced on 24 December 1970 that Bray would head a committee charged with establishing Griffith University. The Mount Gravatt site was renamed Nathan and set to become Griffith's first campus.[11] On 30 September 1971, the Queensland Government officially created and recognised Griffith University with the passing of the Assent to Griffith University Act 1971.[11] On 5 March 1975, Griffith University began teaching 451 students in four schools: Australian Environmental Studies, Humanities, Modern Asian Studies and Science.[3] The university was distinguished by its ""problem-based"" rather than disciplinary approach to course design and research. Expansion[edit] In the 1990s, the Dawkins Revolution saw a number of tertiary education reforms in Australia, resulting in a series of amalgamations of colleges and universities. In 1990, the Mount Gravatt Teacher's College (established in 1969) and Gold Coast College of Advanced Education (established in 1987) became official campuses of Griffith University. The Queensland Conservatorium of Music continued the higher education mergers and became an official part of Griffith University in 1991. Originally established in 1957, the new entity became known as Queensland Conservatorium Griffith University. In 1992, the amalgamations were completed for Griffith, with the Queensland College of Art (QCA), established in 1881 and recognised as the oldest continuous operating art training institution in Australia, officially becoming part of the university.[11] Griffith's fifth campus, Logan, opened in 1998. Located in the suburb of Meadowbrook, on an area of green fields south of Brisbane, the Logan campus was established to specifically address the interests and needs of the Logan City area.[4] Griffith University was an official Partner of the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games. Over 500 university students and staff were closely involved in the planning and delivery of event.[12] Campuses[edit] Griffith University's campuses are distinctive for their nature-based settings within urban environments. Griffith University busway station on the South East Busway Griffith University (Nathan Campus) from Stadium Path Gold Coast campus[edit] The Gold Coast campus is located in the Gold Coast suburb of Southport. Set in native bushland, on the land of the Aboriginal Yugambeh and Kombumerri peoples,[13] this campus plays host to over 18,200 students from all over Australia and the world. It is Griffith University's largest campus. The campus has seen significant growth and development over the last few years, with the opening of the $150 million Griffith Health Centre and the neighbouring Gold Coast University Hospital in 2013, and the launch of the $38 million Griffith Business School building in 2014. The campus is serviced by two Gold Coast light rail (G:link) stations, and is a major interchange for bus routes. Logan campus[edit] Logan is Griffith University's community-focused campus. Hosting almost 2500 students, the campus offers degrees in human services and social work, nursing and midwifery, business and commerce, education and information technology. The campus has strong connections with the local community, hosting numerous sporting and cultural events throughout the year. Nathan campus[edit] Nathan, Griffith's foundation campus, is situated in tranquil, native bushland on the edge of Toohey Forest and less than 10 kilometres from the Brisbane CBD. Nathan hosts over 13,000 students and offers degrees in business and government, engineering and information technology, environment, humanities and languages, law, and science and aviation. The buildings at the Nathan campus were designed to fit into the environment by Roger Kirk Johnson the founding architectural designer of the campus, following the slope of the land and using architectural means of cooling.[10] The library building was designed by Robin Gibson and won the first national award for library design. The clusters of buildings, sports facilities, bushland reserves and recreational areas are connected by integrated networks of walking paths. On the northern edge of the campus lies the Dunn Memorial, a fitting tribute.[14] In 2013, the six-star, green-rated Sir Samuel Griffith Centre was opened on the Nathan campus. The building operates off the grid and is powered by a combination of photovoltaics and hydrogen. The campus has two residential colleges for students and a range of sporting facilities. Mount Gravatt campus[edit] Queensland Conservatorium of Music The Mount Gravatt campus, adjacent to the Nathan campus, hosts 4400 students. It is the university's social sciences and humanities hub and the base for research into crucial social issues, including education and suicide prevention. Like Nathan, the campus is situated on the edge of Toohey Forest. The campus features a recently upgraded aquatic and fitness centre, with a heated pool and indoor and outdoor recreation areas, co-located with a 16-court tennis centre, a training oval, and basketball and netball courts. On-campus student accommodation is also available. South Bank campus[edit] Located in Brisbane's cultural precinct, the South Bank campus is Griffith University's creative hub. It encompasses Griffith's Queensland College of Art and Queensland Conservatorium, and the Griffith Film School and Griffith Graduate Centre. As of 2020[update], enrolment for all four units is about 3400 students.[15] Digital campus[edit] Griffith's Digital campus, officially launched in 2018, offers over 100 degrees that can be studied online. With over 20,000 students,[16] the Digital campus is Griffith's third largest and fastest growing campus.[5] Griffith also offers online degrees in partnership with Open Universities Australia, and free online courses through FutureLearn. Organisation[edit] Griffith University is structured in four academic groups, with teaching offered through a range of schools, colleges and departments.[17] Arts, Education and Law[edit] School of Criminology and Criminal Justice School of Education and Professional Studies School of Humanities, Languages and Social Science Griffith Law School Queensland College of Art Griffith Film School Queensland Conservatorium Griffith Business School[edit] Department of Accounting, Finance and Economics Department of Employment Relations and Human Resources Department of Business Strategy and Innovation Department of Marketing Department of Tourism, Sport and Hotel Management School of Government and International Relations Griffith Health[edit] School of Applied Psychology School of Health Sciences and Social Work School of Medicine and Dentistry School of Nursing and Midwifery School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences Griffith Sciences[edit] School of Engineering and Built Environment School of Environment and Science School of Information and Communication Technology Academic profile[edit] Rankings[edit] University rankingsGriffith UniversityQS World[18]303THE World[19]201-250ARWU World[20]301-400US News World[21]242CWTS Leiden World[22]300Australian rankingsQS National[18]18THE National[23]9=ARWU National[24]16-22US News National[25]13CWTS Leiden National[22]15ERA National[27]21[26] In Australia, Griffith University ranks 18th out of 37 universities.[28] Griffith is in the top 400 universities worldwide in five major world rankings; Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU), QS World University Rankings (QS), Leiden Ranking, Times Higher Education World University Rankings (THE-WUR),[29] University Ranking by Academic Performance (URAP).[30] Griffith also ranks highly as a young university, ranking 33rd in the 2021 QS University Rankings Top 50 Under 50[31] and 30th in the 2020 Times Higher Education Top 100 under 50.[32] Griffith has several top ranking subjects according to the ShanghaiRanking Global Ranking of Academic Subjects 2020:[33] Top 10 Hospitality and Tourism Management (third globally, first in Australia) Marine/Ocean Engineering (eighth globally, second in Australia) Nursing and Midwifery (second globally, first in Australia)[citation needed] Top 50-100 Computer Science and Engineering Education Geography Law (first in Australia) Water Resources Top 101-150 Chemical Engineering (equal fifth in Australia) Civil Engineering Dentistry and Oral Sciences (third in Australia) Ecology Environmental Science and Engineering Materials Science and Engineering Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Oceanography Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences Political Science (third to fifth in Australia) Public Administration According to Excellence in Research for Australia (2018), Griffith was rated ‘well above world-standard’ in 24 fields of research, including chemical sciences, dentistry, political science and technology.[33] MBA[edit] The Griffith MBA is ranked among Australia's leading MBA programs in CEO Magazine and its 2015 MBA Rankings.[34] The rankings are compiled by the International Graduate Forum and are designed to present a 360-degree view of the world's leading business schools. The Griffith MBA is placed sixth in the top tier of Australian programs, and is the only Queensland program to feature in the top 10. It also features in the magazine's top 20 Global MBA Rankings. The MBA is also the highest-ranking Australian MBA in the Aspen Institute's Centre for Business Education's most recent Beyond Grey Pinstripes Global Top 100, ranked at number 26.[35] Griffith University was awarded this ranking for its focus on responsible leadership, sustainable business practices and the Asia-Pacific. It was also acknowledged as one of Australia's best, ranking fourth in Australia in the 2015 Financial Review BOSS Magazine MBA Survey.[36] Teaching awards[edit] Griffith features prominently in Australia's national teaching awards and citations. Since 2009, Griffith has won 8 awards for Teaching Excellence, 6 awards for Programs that Enhance Learning, 42 Citations for Outstanding Contributions to Student Learning and seven National Teaching Fellowships. Three Griffith staff have been named the Prime Minister's Australian Teacher of the Year.[6] Research[edit] Griffith researchers work in 38 centres and institutes, investigating areas such as water science, climate change adaptation, criminology and crime prevention, sustainable tourism and health and chronic disease. The University's major research institutes include: Advanced Design and Prototyping Technologies Institute (ADaPT) Australian Rivers Institute Cities Research Institute Environmental Futures Research Institute Griffith Asia Institute Griffith Criminology Institute Griffith Institute for Educational Research Griffith Institute for Tourism Institute for Glycomics Institute for Integrated and Intelligent Systems Menzies Health Institute Queensland (formerly the Griffith Health Institute) Griffith Institute for Drug Discovery (GRIDD) Additionally, Griffith hosts several externally supported centres and facilities, including: Australian Institute for Suicide Research and Prevention National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility Smart Water Research Centre NHMRC Centre of Research Excellence in Nursing Research commercialisation[edit] Griffith offers research commercialisation and services for business, industry and government through Griffith Enterprise. Other centres[edit] As well as research centres and institutes, Griffith has a number of cultural and community focused organisations. These include the EcoCentre, which provides a space for environmental education activities, exhibitions, seminars and workshops; and the Centre for Interfaith & Cultural Dialogue (formerly the Multi-Faith Centre). Recognized research[edit] In 2021, a research team led by the University discovered a new type of tree frog in New Guinea which is commonly known as the ""chocolate frog"".[37] Student life[edit] Student organisations[edit] Griffith University has a wide array of cultural, intellectual, sporting and social groups. Its Student Guild[38] takes care of these clubs on the Gold Coast campus, as well as student issues, accommodation, employment, publication, events, sport and recreation. On the Nathan campus, Campus Life[39] supports many clubs including the long running GRUBS[40] (Griffith University Bushwalking Club), the Karate and Kickboxing club and the Griffith University Aikido Club. Uniquely, Griffith University students are represented by two statutory embedded student organisations.[citation needed] The Griffith University Student Representative Council (GUSRC) represents undergraduate students and the Griffith University Postgraduate Students Association (GUPSA) represents post-graduate students in all campuses apart from the Gold Coast. GUPSA is a constituent member of the Council of Australian Postgraduate Associations. Unique to the Gold Coast is the Student Guild (GUSG), which represents all students from this campus and has an administrative structure that is apparently[clarification needed] independent to the university. Griffith Honours College[edit] The Griffith Honours College offers high achieving students potential opportunities to enrich their university experience through mentoring, international experiences, leadership roles and community engagement activities. Griffith Sports College[edit] Students who are elite athletes are eligible to join the Griffith Sports College, which provides support by helping them balance sporting and university commitments. GUMURRII Student Support Unit[edit] The GUMURRII Student Support Unit (SSU)[41] is the heart of Griffith's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community and is located on each of Griffith's five campuses. GUMURRII is a dedicated Student Support Unit for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander staff assist students from recruitment, to orientation providing undergraduate and postgraduate support through to graduation to afar. Griffith College[edit] Located on Griffith University's Mount Gravatt and Gold Coast campuses, Griffith College, formerly the Queensland Institute of Business and Technology, offers undergraduate diplomas in a range of areas, which provide a pathway into many of Griffith's degree programs. Griffith English Language Institute[edit] Students from non-English-speaking backgrounds can study English at the Griffith English Language Institute (GELI). A wide range of English language courses are available to help students improve their English for work, travel, study or everyday purposes. Residential colleges[edit] Main article: Residential colleges of Griffith University Kinaba, KGBC colleges, Griffith University Nathan Campus Griffith University has four residential colleges, with two located on its Nathan campus and one each on its Mt Gravatt and Gold Coast campuses. The three colleges located in Brisbane compete in the sporting Inter-College Cup, also known as the ICC. The premier event of the ICC is the Phar Cup, where both female and male teams compete in rugby league matches against each other. The colleges are as follows: Bellenden Ker College, a.k.a. BK, is a co-educational college located on the Nathan Campus in the Toohey forest reserve. KGBC, also known as ""The Flats"", consist of four co-educational undergraduate and postgraduate apartments on the Nathan Campus. Mt Gravatt College, a.k.a. MG, is a co-educational college located on the Mt Gravatt Campus which itself sits on the hill for which the surrounding suburbs are named. Griffith University Village is a collection of co-ed apartments on the Gold Coast Campus. Safe Campuses initiative[edit] Between 2011 and 2016 there were 46 officially reported cases of sexual abuse and harassment on campus released by the university, resulting in no expulsions and one six-month suspension, the highest reported stats in Queensland at the time.[42] This was fewer than the 2017 Australian Human Rights Commission report on sexual assault and harassment, which found reported figures higher than this.[43] Following the release of the report, Griffith University established the Safe Campuses Taskforce.[44] The Taskforce and its working parties are working to ensure Griffith's campuses provide safe, inclusive and respectful environments for all students and staff. Alumni[edit] For a more comprehensive list, see List of Griffith University people. Griffith has over 200,000 alumni.[45] Notable graduates have been journalists, musicians, actors, artists, filmmakers, photographers, athletes, activists and politicians in the Parliament of Australia and the Parliament of Queensland.

The traditional owners of this region of south-east Queensland are the Yugambeh language people. The demonym for the Gold Coast is Gold Coaster. With an estimated population of 679,127,[1] at June 2019 (including 79,001 in the adjacent Tweed Valley of New South Wales), the Gold Coast is the sixth-largest city in Australia, making it the largest non-capital city, and Queensland's second-largest city.[3] The Gold Coast is a major tourist destination with a sunny, subtropical climate and has become widely known for its world-class surfing beaches, high-rise dominated skyline, theme parks, nightlife, and rainforest hinterland. The city is part of the nation's entertainment industry with television productions and a major film industry.

Europeans arrived in 1823 when explorer John Oxley landed at Mermaid Beach. The hinterland's red cedar supply attracted people to the area in the mid-19th century. A number of small townships developed along the coast and in the hinterland. The western suburb of Nerang was surveyed and established as a base for the industry and by 1870 a town reserve had been set aside.[7] By 1873, the town reserve of Burleigh Heads had also been surveyed and successful land sales had taken place.[8] In 1875, the small settlement opposite the boat passage at the head of the Nerang River, known as Nerang Heads or Nerang Creek Heads, was surveyed and renamed Southport, with the first land sales scheduled to take place in Beenleigh.[9] Southport quickly grew a reputation as a secluded holiday destination for wealthy Brisbane residents. After the establishment of the Surfers Paradise Hotel in the late 1920s, the Gold Coast region grew significantly.[10][11] The Gold Coast was originally known as the South Coast (because it was south of Brisbane). However, over-inflated prices for real estate and other goods and services led to the nickname of ""Gold Coast"" from 1950.[12][13][14][15][16] South Coast locals initially considered the name ""Gold Coast"" derogatory.[17][18] However, soon the ""Gold Coast"" simply became a convenient way to refer to the holiday strip from Southport to Coolangatta.[19][20][21][22][23] The Town of South Coast was formed through the amalgamation of Town of Coolangatta and Town of Southport along with the coastal areas (such as Burleigh Heads) from the Shire of Nerang on 17 June 1949 with the effect of having the present-day Gold Coast coastal strip as a single local government area. As the tourism industry grew into the 1950s, local businesses began to adopt the term Gold Coast in their names, and on 23 October 1958 the Town of South Coast was renamed Town of Gold Coast.[24] The area was proclaimed a city, despite the lack of a cathedral, less than one year later on 16 May 1959.[25] The area boomed in the 1980s as a leading tourist destination. In 1994, the City of Gold Coast local government area was expanded to include the Shire of Albert,[26] becoming the second most populous local government area in Australia after the City of Brisbane.[citation needed] In 2007, the Gold Coast overtook the population of Newcastle, New South Wales, to become the sixth largest city in Australia and the largest non-capital city.[27] The Gold Coast hosted the 2018 Commonwealth Games.[28] Geography[edit] View from the lookout at Purling Brook Falls in the Gold Coast hinterland Aerial view of Gold Coast suburbs: Mermaid Waters (left) and Broadbeach Waters (right). The image depicts the man-made canals of the city, built to accommodate housing development. The Gold Coast is approximately half covered by forests of various types. This includes small patches of near-pristine ancient rainforest, mangrove-covered islands, and patches of coastal heathlands and farmland with areas of uncleared eucalyptus forest. Of the plantation pine forests that were planted in the 1950s and 1960s, when commercial forest planting for tax minimisation was encouraged by the Commonwealth government, tiny remnants remain.[29] Gold Coast City lies in the southeast corner of Queensland, to the south of Brisbane, the state capital. The Albert River separates the Gold Coast from Logan City, a local government area south of the City of Brisbane. Gold Coast City stretches from the Albert River, Logan River, and Southern Moreton Bay to the border with New South Wales (NSW) approximately 56 km (35 mi) south, and extends from the coast west to the foothills of the Great Dividing Range in World Heritage listed Lamington National Park. The southernmost town of Gold Coast City, Coolangatta, includes Point Danger and its lighthouse. Coolangatta is a twin city with Tweed Heads located directly across the NSW border. At 28°10′00″S 153°33′00″E﻿ / ﻿28.1667°S 153.55°E﻿ / -28.1667; 153.55, this is the most easterly point on the Queensland mainland (Point Lookout on the offshore island of North Stradbroke is slightly further east). From Coolangatta, approximately forty kilometres of holiday resorts and surfing beaches stretch north to the suburb of Main Beach, and then further on Stradbroke Island. The suburbs of Southport and Surfers Paradise form the Gold Coast's commercial centre. The major river in the area is the Nerang River. Much of the land between the coastal strip and the hinterland were once wetlands drained by this river, but the swamps have been converted into man-made waterways (over 260 kilometres (160 mi) in length[30] or over 9 times the length of the canals of Venice, Italy) and artificial islands covered in upmarket homes. The heavily developed coastal strip sits on a narrow barrier sandbar between these waterways and the sea. To the west, the city borders a part of the Great Dividing Range commonly referred to as the Gold Coast hinterland. A 206 km2 (80 sq mi) section of the mountain range is protected by Lamington National Park and has been listed as a World Heritage area in recognition of its ""outstanding geological features displayed around shield volcanic craters and the high number of rare and threatened rainforest species"".[31] The area attracts bushwalkers and day-trippers. Important rainforest pollinating and seed-dispersing Black flying foxes (Pteropus alecto) are found in the area and may be heard foraging at night. Urban structure[edit] Main article: List of Gold Coast suburbs The City of Gold Coast includes suburbs, localities, towns and rural districts. The declaration of Southport as a Priority Development Area (PDA) and new investment into the CBD is driving transformative change and creating new business and investment opportunities. Skyline of Gold Coast, 2015 Waterways[edit] Aerial panorama of Wet 'n' Wild and itsWaterfront canal living is a feature of the Gold Coast. Most canal frontage homes have pontoons. The Gold Coast Seaway, between The Spit and South Stradbroke Island, allows vessels direct access to the Pacific Ocean from The Broad and many of the city's canal estates. Breakwaters on either side of the Seaway prevent longshore drift and the bar from silting up. A sand pumping operation on the Spit pipes sand under the Seaway to continue this natural process. Residential canals were first built in the Gold Coast in the 1950s and construction continues. Most canals are extensions to the Nerang River, but there are more to the south along Tallebudgera Creek and Currumbin Creek and to the north along the Gold Coast Broadwater, South Stradbroke Island, Coomera River and southern Moreton Bay. Early canals included Florida Gardens and Isle of Capri which were under construction at the time of a 1954 flood.[32] Recently constructed canals include Harbour Quays and Riverlinks completed in 2007. There are over 890 kilometres (550 mi) of constructed residential waterfront land within the city that is home to over 80,000 residents. Beaches[edit] The entrance to Surfers Paradise beach Burleigh Heads beach with Surfers Paradise skyline visible on the horizon The city consists of 70 kilometres (43 mi) of coastline, with some of the most popular surf breaks in Australia and the world including, South Stradbroke Island, The Spit, Main Beach, Surfers Paradise, Broadbeach, Mermaid Beach, Nobby's Beach, Miami, North Burleigh Beach, Burleigh Beach, Burleigh Heads, Tallebudgera Beach, Palm Beach, South Palm Beach, Currumbin Beach, Tugun, Bilinga, North Kirra Beach Kirra, Coolangatta, Greenmount, Rainbow Bay, Snapper Rocks and Froggies Beach. Duranbah Beach is one of the world's best known surfing beaches and is often thought of as being part of Gold Coast City, but is actually just across the New South Wales state border in the Tweed Shire. There are also beaches along many of the Gold Coast's 860 km (530 mi) of navigable tidal waterways. Popular inland beaches include Southport, Budds Beach, Marine Stadium, Currumbin Alley, Tallebudgera Estuary, Jacobs Well, Jabiru Island, Paradise Point, Harley Park Labrador, Santa Barbara, Boykambil and Evandale Lake. Beach safety and management The Gold Coast has Australia's largest[33] professional surf lifesaving service to protect people on the beaches and to promote surf safety throughout the community. The Queensland Department of Primary Industries carries out the Queensland Shark Control Program (SCP) to protect swimmers from sharks.[34] Sharks are caught by using nets and baited drumlines off the major swimming beaches. Even with the SCP, sharks do range within sight of the patrolled beaches. Lifeguards will clear swimmers from the water if it is considered that there is a safety risk. Gold Coast beaches have experienced periods of severe beach erosion. In 1967, a series of 11 cyclones removed most of the sand from Gold Coast beaches. The Government of Queensland engaged engineers from Delft University in the Netherlands to advise what to do about the beach erosion. The Delft Report[35] was published in 1971 and outlined a series of works for Gold Coast Beaches including Gold Coast Seaway,[36] works at Narrow Neck that resulted in the Northern Gold Coast Beach Protection Strategy[37] and works at the Tweed River that became the Tweed River Entrance Sand Bypassing Project.[38] By 2005 most of the recommendations of the 1971 Delft Report had been implemented. City of Gold Coast commenced implementation of the Palm Beach Protection Strategy[39] but ran into considerable opposition from the community participating in a NO REEF protest campaign.[40] The City of Gold Coast Council then committed to completing a review of beach management practices to update the Delft Report. The Gold Coast Shoreline Management Plan[41] will be delivered by organisations including the Environmental Protection Agency, City of Gold Coast and the Griffith Centre for Coastal Management. Gold Coast City is also investing into the quality and capacity of the Gold Coast Oceanway that provides sustainable transport along Gold Coast beaches.[citation needed] Climate[edit] The Gold Coast experiences a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification Cfa), with mild to warm winters and hot, humid summers. The city experiences substantial summer precipitation mostly concentrated in thunderstorms and heavy showers with rain events occasionally lasting up to a few weeks at a time giving residents ""the summer blues"", while winter is pleasantly mild to warm with little rain. In fact, it is for this pleasant winter weather that both the city and the Sunshine Coast—the coastal region north of Brisbane—are internationally renowned. Extreme temperatures recorded at Gold Coast Seaway have ranged from 2.5 °C (36 °F) on 19 July 2007 to 40.5 °C (105 °F) on 22 February 2005, although the city rarely experiences temperatures above 35 °C (95 °F) in summer or below 5 °C (41 °F) in winter.[42] The average temperature of the sea at Surfers Paradise ranges from 21.5 °C (70.7 °F) in July and August to 27.1 °C (80.8 °F) in February.[43] Climate data for Gold Coast, Seaway (1992–2020) Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °C (°F) 38.5(101.3) 40.5(104.9) 36.3(97.3) 33.3(91.9) 29.4(84.9) 27.1(80.8) 28.9(84.0) 32.4(90.3) 33.0(91.4) 36.8(98.2) 35.5(95.9) 39.4(102.9) 40.5(104.9) Mean maximum °C (°F) 33.2(91.8) 32.7(90.9) 32.5(90.5) 29.7(85.5) 26.9(80.4) 24.9(76.8) 25.1(77.2) 26.5(79.7) 29.1(84.4) 31.3(88.3) 31.8(89.2) 33.3(91.9) 33.3(91.9) Average high °C (°F) 28.9(84.0) 28.7(83.7) 28.0(82.4) 26.1(79.0) 23.6(74.5) 21.4(70.5) 21.3(70.3) 22.1(71.8) 24.0(75.2) 25.4(77.7) 26.9(80.4) 28.0(82.4) 25.4(77.7) Daily mean °C (°F) 25.4(77.7) 25.2(77.4) 24.5(76.1) 22.2(72.0) 19.5(67.1) 17.3(63.1) 16.7(62.1) 17.3(63.1) 19.4(66.9) 21.1(70.0) 23.0(73.4) 24.2(75.6) 21.3(70.4) Average low °C (°F) 21.9(71.4) 21.8(71.2) 20.9(69.6) 18.3(64.9) 15.4(59.7) 13.3(55.9) 12.0(53.6) 12.5(54.5) 14.8(58.6) 16.9(62.4) 19.0(66.2) 20.5(68.9) 17.3(63.1) Mean minimum °C (°F) 18.8(65.8) 19.3(66.7) 17.6(63.7) 14.4(57.9) 10.5(50.9) 7.9(46.2) 7.1(44.8) 7.7(45.9) 10.5(50.9) 12.5(54.5) 15.1(59.2) 17.0(62.6) 7.1(44.8) Record low °C (°F) 16.7(62.1) 17.2(63.0) 13.4(56.1) 8.9(48.0) 6.6(43.9) 3.8(38.8) 2.5(36.5) 4.2(39.6) 7.9(46.2) 9.4(48.9) 8.2(46.8) 14.7(58.5) 2.5(36.5) Average precipitation mm (inches) 136.7(5.38) 183.4(7.22) 134.0(5.28) 118.7(4.67) 97.6(3.84) 113.9(4.48) 49.5(1.95) 54.8(2.16) 41.2(1.62) 87.4(3.44) 106.7(4.20) 129.0(5.08) 1,252.9(49.32) Average precipitation days (≥ 1 mm) 8.8 10.3 11.0 8.6 8.1 7.2 5.0 4.3 5.1 6.3 8.0 9.3 92 Average afternoon relative humidity (%) 70 70 68 65 62 58 55 56 62 66 68 69 64 Average ultraviolet index 13 12 10 7 4 3 4 5 7 9 11 13 8 Source: Bureau of Meteorology[44][45][46] Demographics[edit] According to the 2016 census, the population of the Gold Coast was 569,997. The median age was 39 years old, 1 year older than the nationwide median. The male-to-female ratio was 48.6-to-51.4.[47] The most commonly nominated ancestries were English (29.3%), Australian (22.5%), Irish (8.2%), Scottish (7.5%), and German (3.6%). 64% of people were born in Australia, while the other most common countries of birth were New Zealand (7.9%), England (5.2%), China and South Africa (1.2% each), and Japan (0.7%). Indigenous Australians accounted for 1.7% of the population.[47] The most commonly spoken languages other than English were Mandarin (1.6%), Japanese (1.0%), Korean and Spanish (0.6% each), and Cantonese (0.5%). The most common religious affiliations reported were none (31.8%), Catholic (20.7%), Anglican (16.2%), and Uniting Church (3.9%).[47] Government[edit] Main articles: City of Gold Coast and Government of Queensland Administratively, the Gold Coast is a local government area called the City of Gold Coast. The City of Gold Coast Council has 14 elected councillors, each representing a division of the City. Businessman Tom Tate is the current Mayor of the Gold Coast, first elected in 2012. Former mayors include Ron Clake, Gary Baildon, Lex Bell, Ray Stevens, Ern Harley and Sir Bruce Small, who was responsible for the development of many of the canal estates that are now home to thousands of Gold Coast residents. At the state level, the Gold Coast area is represented by eleven members in the Legislative Assembly of Queensland. The seats they hold are: Bonney, Broadwater, Burleigh, Coomera, Currumbin, Gaven, Mermaid Beach, Mudgeeraba, Southport, Surfers Paradise and Theodore. Federally, the Gold Coast area is split between five divisions in the House of Representatives: Fadden (northern), Moncrieff (central) and McPherson (southern) are located entirely within the Gold Coast, while Forde (north-west) and Wright (south-west) encompass parts of the Gold Coast and other areas of Southeast Queensland. Politically, the Gold Coast has often tilted conservative.[48] It was a Country Party bastion for most of the first three decades after World War II, but increasing urbanisation has made it a Liberal stronghold. Labor has historically only done well around Labrador and Coolangatta. Only one Labor MP has ever represented a significant portion of the Gold Coast at the federal level since 1949; the three Gold Coast divisions have only returned Liberals since 1984. At the state level, Labor was fairly competitive in the Gold Coast for most of the early part of the 21st century. However, as part of its massive landslide in the 2012 state election, the Liberal National Party won every seat there. The LNP repeated its sweep of the Gold Coast seats at the 2015 election, and retained all but one Gold Coast seat at the 2017 state election. Southport Courthouse is the city's major courthouse and has jurisdiction to hear petty criminal offences and civil matters up to A$250,000. Indictable offences, criminal sentencing and civil matters above A$250,000 are heard in the higher Supreme Court of Queensland which is located in Brisbane. There is also a subsidiary Magistrates Court, located at the southern suburb of Coolangatta. In 2013 a brawl between members of Outlaw motorcycle gangs also called ""bikies"" who fought each other outside a Broadbeach restaurant caused mass fear to restaurant patrons and police.[49] This led to the toughest anti-bikie laws introduced in Australia known as Vicious Lawless Association Disestablishment Act 2013. Economy[edit] Gold Coast skyline, 2011 In fifty years, Gold Coast City has grown from a small beachside holiday destination to Australia's sixth largest city (and the country's most populous non-capital city). Situated within South East Queensland's growth corridor, the Gold Coast is one of Australia's fastest growing large cities, with a 5-year annual average population growth rate to 2015 of 1.8%, compared to 1.5% nationally.[50] Gross Regional Product has risen from A$9.7 billion in 2001, to A$15.6 billion in 2008, a rise of 61 percent.[51] Tourism remains fundamental to Gold Coast City's economy, with almost 10 million visitors a year to the area.[52] In the past the economy was driven by the population derived industries of construction, tourism and retail. Some diversification has taken place, with the city now having an industrial base formed of marine, education, information communication and technology, food, tourism, creative, environment and sports industries. These nine industries have been identified as the key industries by the City of Gold Coast Council to deliver the city's economic prosperity. Gold Coast City's unemployment rate (5.6 per cent) is below the national level (5.9 per cent).[53] The declaration of Southport as the Gold Coast central business district (CBD) and a Priority Development Area (PDA), as well as new investment into the CBD, is driving transformative change and creating new business and investment opportunities. The Gold Coast Economic Development Strategy 2013 - 2023[54] outlines the framework for the city's long-term growth and prosperity. The strategy outlines actions in the following areas, Innovation, Culture, Infrastructure, Competitive business, Workforce, International. Tourism[edit] Q1, the tallest building in Australia and the world's tallest residential building upon completion in 2005 (currently the tenth tallest) The Surfers Paradise Meter Maids were founded in 1965 and have since become an icon of the Gold Coast. Around 10 million tourists visit the Gold Coast area every year: of 849,114 international visitors, 3,468,000 domestic overnight visitors and 5,366,000 daytrip visitors. Tourism is the region's biggest industry,[55] directly contributing more than $4.4 billion into the city economy every year and directly accounting for one in four jobs in the city[56] There are approximately 65,000 beds, 60 kilometres (37 mi) of beach, 600 kilometres (370 mi) of canal, 100,000 hectares of nature reserve, 500 restaurants, 40 golf courses and five major theme parks in the city. Gold Coast Airport provides connection across Australia and internationally with airlines including Flyscoot, Jetstar, Qantas, Air New Zealand, Virgin Australia and Airasia X. Brisbane Airport is less than one hour from the centre of Gold Coast, and direct trains operate. Tourism is Gold Coast City's main industry, generating a total of $2.5 billion in revenue per annum.[citation needed] The Gold Coast is the most popular tourist destination in Queensland.[57] It is Australia's 5th most visited destination by international tourists.[58] The city has over 13,000 available guest rooms contributing over $335 million to the local economy each year. Accommodation options available range from hostels to five star resorts and hotels. The most common style of accommodation is three and four star self-contained apartments.[citation needed] Tourist attractions include surf beaches, and theme parks including Dreamworld, Sea World, Wet'n'Wild Water World, Warner Bros. Movie World, WhiteWater World, Topgolf, Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary, David Fleay Wildlife Park, Australian Outback Spectacular, and Paradise Country. Since the opening of what was then the world's highest residential tower in 2005 (it is now the fifth highest), the Q1 building has been a destination for tourists and locals alike. It is the second highest public vantage point in the southern hemisphere after the Eureka Tower in Melbourne. The observation deck at level 77 is the highest of its kind in Queensland and offers views in all directions, from Brisbane to Byron Bay. It towers over the Surfers Paradise skyline, with the observation deck 230 metres (755 feet) high, and the spire extending nearly another hundred metres up. In total, the Q1 is 322.5 metres (1058 feet) high, making it the tallest building in Australia. Another famous tourist attraction are the Surfers Paradise Meter Maids, instituted in 1965 to put a positive spin on new parking regulations. To avoid tickets being issued for expired parking, the Meter Maids dispense coins into the meter and leave a calling card under the windscreen wiper of the vehicle. The Maids are still a part of the Surfers Paradise culture but the scheme is now run by private enterprise. Chinatown, Gold Coast, is an integral part of the revitalisation of Southport as an international CBD.[59][clarification needed] Film production[edit] See also: List of films shot on the Gold Coast The Gold Coast is the major film production hub in Queensland and has accounted for 75%[60] of all film production in Queensland since the 1990s, with an expenditure of around $150 million per year. The Gold Coast is the third largest film production centre in Australia behind Sydney and Melbourne. It is the filming site for major motion pictures including Muriel's Wedding (1994), Ghost Ship (2002), Scooby Doo (2002), House of Wax (2005), Superman Returns (2006), Unbroken (2014), The Inbetweeners 2 (2014), San Andreas (2015) Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales (2017), Kong: Skull Island (2017), Thor: Ragnarok (2017), Pacific Rim: Uprising (2018), Aquaman (2018), Dora the Explorer (2019)[61] and Godzilla vs. Kong (2020).[62] Village Roadshow Studios are adjacent to the Warner Bros Movie World Theme Park at Oxenford. The Studios consists of eight sound stages, production offices, editing rooms, wardrobe, construction workshops, water tanks and commissary. These sound stages vary in size and have an overall floor area of 10,844 sq metres, making Warner Roadshow Studio one of the largest studio lots in the Southern Hemisphere. The Queensland Government actively supports the film and television production industry in Queensland and provides both non-financial and financial assistance through the Pacific Film and Television Commission.[63] Culture[edit] The Gold Coast's culture has been impacted by rapid development and traditional marketing programs orbiting around 'sun, sand, surf and sex.'[64] Despite rapid socio-economic changes and a tourist-centred image, there is evidence of local resident-driven culture (such as surf gangs) in geographical pockets and a broader 'Gold Coaster' identity drawn from globalised resort and real estate marketing material.[65] The Gold Coast hosts cultural activities that attract tourists and residents alike. Music[edit] Music groups in this region include the Northern Rivers Symphony Orchestra and Operator Please. Musicians Cody Simpson and Ricki-Lee Coulter are from the Gold Coast. Music events include Big Day Out, Good Vibrations Festival, Summafieldayze, the Blues on Broadbeach Festival and V Festival (2007–2009).[citation needed] Arts[edit] Home of the Arts (HOTA) is the Gold Coast's premier cultural facility for visual and performing arts with a performance theatre, two cinemas and an underground venue. The theatre has hosted performance by the Imperial Russian Ballet, The Australian Ballet and the Queensland Ballet. Musicals, plays and a variety of performances are regularly scheduled. The city is also home to the Gold Coast City Art Gallery. Film festivals and the Comedy Club host international artists.[clarification needed] A redeveloped Gold Coast cultural precinct opened before the city hosted the 2018 Commonwealth Games.[66] Bleach* The Gold Coast Festival takes place annually across the City in August. The program is one of Australia's leading and most exciting site-specific contemporary arts programs. Quintessentially Gold Coast, Bleach* celebrate's the city's most dynamic and adventurous artists, welcomes renowned Australian and international collaborators and engages a broad audience through a range of events. Bleach* has attracted more than 470,000 people since its inaugural year in 2012. The program features work across all genres including dance, theatre, contemporary music, opera, installations, circus and major public events. Sport[edit] Main article: Sports on the Gold Coast, Queensland Carrara Stadium, home of the Gold Coast Suns in the Australian Football League The Gold Coast is represented in two national competitions by the following teams: Team name Competition Sport Years Gold Coast Titans National Rugby League Rugby league football 2007–present Gold Coast Suns Australian Football League Australian rules football 2011–present Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre Burleigh Bears rugby league football club play in the Queensland Cup and have won four premierships (in 1999, 2004, 2016 and 2019). Recreational activities on the Gold Coast include surfing, fishing, cycling, boating and golf. The Gold Coast area has numerous golf links, including Hope Island, Sanctuary Cove and The Glades. Sporting facilities include the Carrara Stadium, Carrara Indoor Sport Centre, Nerang Velodrome and the Sports Super Centre. Some of these facilities are being superseded by newer and larger capacity facilities. Two examples of these are the Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre to play host to a Gold Coast Basketball team and Skilled Park to host NRL games. Former World Wrestling Entertainment performer Nathan Jones comes from the Gold Coast, as do Olympic gold medal winning swimmer Grant Hackett, 2011 US Open tennis champion Samantha Stosur and Sally Pearson (who received the keys to the city). Commonwealth Games[edit] Main article: 2018 Commonwealth Games Opening ceremony of the 2018 Commonwealth Games at the Carrara Stadium The 2018 Commonwealth Games was held on the Gold Coast between 4 and 15 April 2018 which was an international multi-sport event for members of the Commonwealth. It was the fifth time Australia had hosted the Commonwealth Games and the first time a major multi-sport event achieved gender equality by having an equal number of events for male and female athletes.[67] More than 4,400 athletes including 300 para-athletes from 71 Commonwealth Games Associations took part in the event.[68] The venues such as Carrara Stadium,[69] Carrara Sports and Leisure Centre,[70] Carrara Indoor Sports Stadium, Gold Coast City Convention and Exhibition Centre.[71] Broadbeach Bowls Club[72] Nerang Mountain Bike Trails,[73] Coomera Indoor Sports Centre,[74] Oxenford Studios,[75] The Gold Coast Hockey Centre,[76] Southport Broadwater Parklands,[77] Optus aquatic centre,[78] Robina Stadium,[79] The Currumbin Beachfront,[80] and Coolangatta Beachfront[81] were used for the Games. Other events[edit] Gold Coast Indy 300 The Gold Coast 600 (formerly known as Lexmark Indy 300) is a car racing event held annually, usually in October. The course runs through the streets of Surfers Paradise and Main Beach. The GC 600 comprises many other events such as the Indy Undie Ball and the Miss Indy Competition. Formerly an Indy car event, V8 Supercars are now the headline attraction, using a similar track route, as the circuit was cut in half by a hairpin. The Magic Millions horse racing auction at the Gold Coast Turf Club was the brainchild of entrepreneurs Gerry Harvey (of retailer Harvey Norman) and John Singleton. There are plans to relocate and build a state-of-the-art new racetrack at Palm Meadows which will incorporate the Magic Million sale with facilities for up to 4000 horses.[citation needed] Each June, Coolangatta hosts the Wintersun Festival renamed as Cooly Rocks On for 2011, a two-week 1950s and 1960s nostalgia festival with free entertainment and attractions, including hot rods, restored cars and revival bands playing music of the era. Every July, more than 25,000 congregate on the Gold Coast from around the world to participate in the Gold Coast Marathon. It is also the largest annual community sporting event held on the Gold Coast. In 2015, it will be held on 4–5 July and the 37th Gold Coast Airport Marathon is set to motivate and challenge more than 25,000 people of all ages and abilities. The Gold Coast Airport Marathon will feature an event for all ages and abilities, including the full Gold Coast Airport Marathon, ASICS Half Marathon, Southern Cross University 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) Run, Suncorp Bank 5.7 kilometres (3.5 mi) Challenge, and Junior Dash over 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) and 2 kilometres (1.2 mi). In August Currumbin hosts the annual half distance Challenge Gold Coast triathlon, with the 1.9 km swim taking place in the Currumbin River, the 90 km bike going through the Currumbin and Tallebudgera Valleys in the Hinterland, and the 21.1 km run going along the beach to Elephant Rock and Tugun.[82] Late November to early December sees thousands of school leavers across the country descend on the Gold Coast for Schoolies, a two-week period of celebration and parties throughout Surfers Paradise, hosted by the City of Gold Coast. The event is often criticised nationally and locally for its portrayal of drinking and acts of violence, however every effort by the Queensland Police Service and State Government to ensure all school leavers have a good time are put into place, including locals volunteering by walking the streets and keeping an eye out for those in need of assistance. Early each year the Gold Coast hosts one leg of the ASP World Tour of surfing, where some of the worlds best surfers compete in the Quiksilver Pro at Coolangatta. The Arts Centre Gold Coast located in Evandale, features a fine art gallery featuring local and international works from painting to sculpture and new media. In addition, there is a theatre for live productions including musicals as well two arts cinemas showing foreign and independent films from Australia and abroad. Chinatown, Gold Coast, located in Southport, hosts the annual citywide Lunar New Year festival as well as regular monthly events. Media[edit] Print The daily local newspaper is the Gold Coast Bulletin which is published by News Corporation. National surfing magazine Australia's Surfing Life is published in the Gold Coast suburb of Burleigh Heads by Morrison Media. Major daily newspapers such as The Courier-Mail and its sibling The Sunday Mail from Brisbane, The Daily Telegraph, The Sunday Telegraph (Sydney), The Sydney Morning Herald and The Sun-Herald from Sydney and The Age, The Sunday Age, The Herald Sun and the Sunday Herald-Sun from Melbourne as well as national publications The Australian and The Australian Financial Review are all available for purchase on the Gold Coast. Other major interstate newspapers and newspapers from neighbouring regions owned by News Corporation or Australian Community Media are also available for purchase via retail outlets on the Gold Coast. Television The Gold Coast straddles the boundary between the television licence areas of both Brisbane (metropolitan) and Northern NSW (regional): the Brisbane primary channels are Seven's BTQ, Nine's QTQ and 10's TVQ, while the regional affiliates are Prime7's NEN, NBN Television and WIN Television. Both sets of commercial stations are available throughout the Gold Coast, as well as the ABC and SBS television services. Other channels include 10 Boss, 10 Peach, Sky News on WIN (regional), ABC TV Plus, ABC Me, ABC News, SBS Viceland, 7two, 7mate, 7flix, 9Gem, 9Go! & 9Life. Subscription television service Foxtel is also available. Of the main metropolitan and regional commercial networks: Seven News and Nine News both produce half-hour local bulletins at 5.30pm on weeknights, broadcasting from studios in Surfers Paradise. These bulletins air as opt-outs on the respective metropolitan stations (BTQ7 and QTQ9) ahead of the main 6pm news from Brisbane. NBN Television airs NBN News, an hour-long regional program combining regional, national and international news - including local opt-outs for the Gold Coast and Northern Rivers - every night at 6pm. It broadcasts from studios in Newcastle with reporters based in Lismore and Surfers Paradise. WIN Television airs short local news updates for the Gold Coast/Lismore district throughout the day. Radio There are numerous commercial, ABC and community stations broadcasting along the Gold Coast. The Gold Coast's FM commercial and community stations include 92.5 Gold FM and 90.9 Sea FM, Hot Tomato, Rebel 99.4, Breeze 100.6, 94.1FM, Juice107.3, Radio Metro and 4CRB. 91.7 ABC Gold Coast is the local ABC station on the Gold Coast, which is complemented by the ABC's national radio services including Triple J, ABC Radio National, ABC NewsRadio and ABC Classic FM. A number of narrowcast services are also available on the Gold Coast including Raw FM and Vision Radio. The Gold Coast can also easily receive Brisbane and Northern NSW FM and AM stations. Education[edit] Bond University in Varsity Lakes Colleges and universities[edit] The Gold Coast is home to two major university campuses: Bond University at Robina and Griffith University at Southport. Southern Cross University also operates a smaller campus in Bilinga near the Gold Coast Airport. The Gold Coast Institute of Technical and Further Education (TAFE) has five campuses at Southport, Ridgeway (Ashmore), Benowa, Coomera and Coolangatta. Schools and libraries[edit] There are over 100 primary and secondary schools, both public and private and of a variety of denominations, including the selective state high school Queensland Academy for Health Sciences and single-sex private schools The Southport School and St Hilda's School. The longest established public school on the Gold Coast is Southport State High School, having originally opened in 1916. There are a number of libraries located on the Gold Coast. For a full list see Gold Coast libraries. Infrastructure[edit] Utilities[edit] Electricity Electricity for the Gold Coast is sourced from Powerlink Queensland at bulk supply substations which is provided via the National Electricity Market from an interconnected multi-State power system. The Government-owned electricity corporation Energex distributes and retails electricity, natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and value-added products and services to residential, industrial and commercial customers in South-East Queensland. Water supply The Hinze Dam 15 km (9.3 mi) southwest of Nerang is the population's main water supply. The Little Nerang Dam which feeds into Hinze Dam can supplement part of the city area's water needs, and both are managed by the city council directorate Gold Coast Water. Reforms of the way in which the water industry is structured have been announced by the State Government, with transfer of ownership and management of water services from local government to the state occurring in 2008–09. City of Gold Coast also sources water from Wivenhoe Dam, west of Brisbane for northern suburbs when the Hinze Dam, at one-tenth of Wivenhoe's capacity, becomes low. Water shortage and water restrictions have been current local issues, and a few new Gold Coast residential areas have recently included dual reticulation in their planning and development to supply water from a new water recycling plant being built concurrently. This will make available highly treated recycled water for use around the home in addition to potable water. The Gold Coast has received world recognition for this scheme in its Pimpama-Coomera suburbs.[83] Gold Coast Water has also been recognised for its world leading HACCP water quality management system by the World Health Organization which published Gold Coast Water's system as a good model for managing water quality and safety from catchment to tap.[84] The Gold Coast desalination plant, which opened in February 2009,[85] has the capacity to supply up to 133 megalitres of desalinated water per day.[86] Transport[edit] Main article: Transport on the Gold Coast, QueenslandThe car is the dominant mode of transport in the Gold Coast, with over 70% of people using it as their sole mode of travelling to work.[87] The Gold Coast has an extensive network of arterial roads that link coastal suburbs with inland suburbs. In recent the years the local and state governments have invested money in transport infrastructure on the Gold Coast to combat the increasing congestion on many of the city's roads. The Gold Coast has an extensive public transport network that includes buses, heavy rail & the new light rail for commuting to work, visiting attractions, and travelling to other destinations. The Gold Coast Highway and G:link crossing the Nerang River Road[edit] A number of major roads connect the Gold Coast with Brisbane, New South Wales, and the surrounding areas. The Pacific Motorway (M1) is the main motorway in the area. Beginning at the Logan Motorway (M6) in Brisbane, it travels through the inland Gold Coast region and links with the Pacific Highway at the New South Wales/Queensland border near Tweed Heads. Before the Tugun Bypass was completed in 2008, the motorway ended at Tugun. The Gold Coast Highway services the coastal suburbs of the Gold Coast, including Surfers Paradise, Southport, and Burleigh Heads. Starting at the Pacific Motorway at Tweed Heads, it runs parallel to the coast until it reaches Labrador, where it turns inland to meet the Pacific Motorway again at Helensvale. Other arterial roads include the Smith Street Motorway which connects Southport, Gold Coast’s CBD with the M1 in Parkwood. Other major roads include Reedy Creek Road, Nerang–Broadbeach Road, Robina Parkway and Southport–Burleigh Road. Light rail[edit] G:link tram on Surfers Paradise Boulevard The Gold Coast's light rail service is called G:link, a 20 km (12 mi) line between Helensvale and Broadbeach that also connects the key activity centres of Southport and Surfers Paradise. The G:link was opened in 2014 between Broadbeach and Southport, with an extension to Helensvale completed in 2017 in preparation for the 2018 Commonwealth Games.[88] Heavy rail[edit] Queensland Rail operates rail services from Brisbane to the Gold Coast along the Gold Coast railway line. The line follows the same route as Brisbane's Beenleigh railway line, continuing on after reaching Beenleigh. It then follows a route similar to that of the Pacific Motorway, passing stations at Ormeau, Coomera, Helensvale, Nerang and Robina before terminating at Varsity Lakes. An extension of the Gold Coast line to the Gold Coast Airport is proposed.[89] Bus[edit] The Gold Coast's main provider of public bus services is Surfside Buslines.[90] It is a part of the TransLink network that coordinates the public transport in South East Queensland. Services are frequent during the day, with intervals being as little as 5 minutes between Southport and Burleigh Heads. Airport[edit] Gold Coast Airport is located at Coolangatta, approximately 22 kilometres (14 mi) south of Surfers Paradise. Services are provided to interstate capitals and major cities as well as to major New Zealand cities, Malaysia, Japan and Singapore.[citation needed] It is the sixth busiest airport in Australia.[citation needed] Projects[edit] The Gold Coast has been debating a controversial cruise ship terminal[91] A third extension of the G:link to Burleigh Heads is planned with fesability studies and community consultation currently underway.[92] The existing heavy rail Gold Coast line will be extended to Coolangatta[93] International relations[edit] This section needs additional citations for verification.

Australia's population of nearly 26 million,[7] in an area of 7,617,930 square kilometres (2,941,300 sq mi),[14] is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard.[15] Canberra is the nation's capital, while the largest city is Sydney, and other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, and Adelaide. Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years,[16] prior to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century, who named it New Holland. In 1770, Australia's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788, a date which became Australia's national day. The population grew steadily in subsequent decades, and by the time of an 1850s gold rush, most of the continent had been explored by European settlers and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established. On 1 January 1901, the six colonies federated, forming the Commonwealth of Australia. Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy, comprising six states and ten territories. Australia is the oldest,[17] flattest,[18] and driest inhabited continent,[19][20] with the least fertile soils.[21][22] It is a megadiverse country, and its size gives it a wide variety of landscapes and climates, with deserts in the centre, tropical rainforests in the north-east, and mountain ranges in the south-east. Australia generates its income from various sources, including mining-related exports, telecommunications, banking, manufacturing, and international education.[23][24][25] Australia is a highly developed country, with the world's twelfth-largest economy. It has a high-income economy, with the world's tenth-highest per capita income.[26] Australia is a regional power, and has the world's thirteenth-highest military expenditure.[27] Immigrants account for 30% of the country's population,[28] the highest proportion among major Western nations.[29] Having the eighth-highest Human Development Index, and the ninth-highest ranked democracy globally as of 2020, Australia ranks highly in quality of life, health, education, economic freedom, civil liberties, and political rights,[30] with all its major cities faring exceptionally in global comparative livability surveys.[31] It is a member of the United Nations, the G20, the Commonwealth of Nations, the ANZUS, the OECD, the WTO, the APEC, the Pacific Islands Forum, the Pacific Community and the ASEAN + 6 mechanism.

Terra Australis still saw occasional usage, such as in scientific texts.[N 6] The name Australia was popularised by the explorer Matthew Flinders, who said it was ""more agreeable to the ear, and an assimilation to the names of the other great portions of the Earth"".[39] Several famous early cartographers also made use of the word Australia on maps. Gerardus Mercator used the phrase climata australia on his double cordiform map of the world of 1538, as did Gemma Frisius, who was Mercator's teacher and collaborator, on his own cordiform wall map in 1540. Australia appears in a book on astronomy by Cyriaco Jacob zum Barth published in Frankfurt am Main in 1545.[40] The first time that Australia appears to have been officially used was in April 1817, when Governor Lachlan Macquarie acknowledged the receipt of Flinders' charts of Australia from Lord Bathurst.[41] In December 1817, Macquarie recommended to the Colonial Office that it be formally adopted.[42] In 1824, the Admiralty agreed that the continent should be known officially by that name.[43] The first official published use of the new name came with the publication in 1830 of The Australia Directory by the Hydrographic Office.[44] Colloquial names for Australia include ""Oz"" and ""the Land Down Under"" (usually shortened to just ""Down Under""). Other epithets include ""the Great Southern Land"", ""the Lucky Country"", ""the Sunburnt Country"", and ""the Wide Brown Land"". The latter two both derive from Dorothea Mackellar's 1908 poem ""My Country"".[45] History Main article: History of Australia Prehistory Further information: Indigenous Australians Aboriginal rock art in the Kimberley region of Western Australia Human habitation of the Australian continent is known to have begun at least 65,000 years ago,[46][47] with the migration of people by land bridges and short sea-crossings from what is now Southeast Asia.[48] The Madjedbebe rock shelter in Arnhem Land is recognised as the oldest site showing the presence of humans in Australia.[49] The oldest human remains found are the Lake Mungo remains, which have been dated to around 41,000 years ago.[50][51] These people were the ancestors of modern Indigenous Australians.[52] Aboriginal Australian culture is one of the oldest continual cultures on Earth.[53] At the time of first European contact, most Indigenous Australians were hunter-gatherers with complex economies and societies.[54][55] Recent archaeological finds suggest that a population of 750,000 could have been sustained.[56][57] Indigenous Australians have an oral culture with spiritual values based on reverence for the land and a belief in the Dreamtime.[58] The Torres Strait Islanders, ethnically Melanesian, obtained their livelihood from seasonal horticulture and the resources of their reefs and seas.[59] The northern coasts and waters of Australia were visited sporadically for trade by Makassan fishermen from what is now Indonesia.[60] European arrival See also: European exploration of Australia Captain Cook landing at Botany Bay, 1770 The first recorded European sighting of the Australian mainland, and the first recorded European landfall on the Australian continent, are attributed to the Dutch.[61] The first ship and crew to chart the Australian coast and meet with Aboriginal people was the Duyfken captained by Dutch navigator, Willem Janszoon.[62] He sighted the coast of Cape York Peninsula in early 1606, and made landfall on 26 February 1606 at the Pennefather River near the modern town of Weipa on Cape York.[63] Later that year, Spanish explorer Luís Vaz de Torres sailed through, and navigated, Torres Strait islands.[64] The Dutch charted the whole of the western and northern coastlines and named the island continent ""New Holland"" during the 17th century, and although no attempt at settlement was made,[63] a number of shipwrecks left men either stranded or, as in the case of the Batavia in 1629, marooned for mutiny and murder, thus becoming the first Europeans to permanently inhabit the continent.[65] William Dampier, an English explorer and privateer, landed on the north-west coast of New Holland in 1688 (while serving as a crewman under pirate Captain John Read[66]) and again in 1699 on a return trip.[67] In 1770, James Cook sailed along and mapped the east coast, which he named New South Wales and claimed for Great Britain.[68] With the loss of its American colonies in 1783, the British Government sent a fleet of ships, the ""First Fleet"", under the command of Captain Arthur Phillip, to establish a new penal colony in New South Wales. A camp was set up and the Union flag raised at Sydney Cove, Port Jackson, on 26 January 1788,[69][70] a date which later became Australia's national day, Australia Day. Most early convicts were transported for petty crimes and assigned as labourers or servants upon arrival. While the majority settled into colonial society once emancipated, convict rebellions and uprisings were also staged, but invariably suppressed under martial law. The 1808 Rum Rebellion, the only successful armed takeover of government in Australia, instigated a two-year period of military rule.[71] The indigenous population declined for 150 years following settlement, mainly due to infectious disease.[72] Thousands more died as a result of frontier conflict with settlers.[73] A government policy of ""assimilation"" beginning with the Aboriginal Protection Act 1869 resulted in the removal of many Aboriginal children from their families and communities—referred to as the Stolen Generations — a practice which also contributed to the decline in the indigenous population.[74] As a result of the 1967 referendum, the Federal government's power to enact special laws with respect to a particular race was extended to enable the making of laws with respect to Aboriginals.[75] Traditional ownership of land (""native title"") was not recognised in law until 1992, when the High Court of Australia held in Mabo v Queensland (No 2) that the legal doctrine that Australia had been terra nullius (""land belonging to no one"") did not apply to Australia at the time of British settlement.[76] Colonial expansion Tasmania's Port Arthur penal settlement is one of eleven UNESCO World Heritage-listed Australian Convict Sites. The expansion of British control over other areas of the continent began in the early 19th century, initially confined to coastal regions. A settlement was established in Van Diemen's Land (present-day Tasmania) in 1803, and it became a separate colony in 1825.[77] In 1813, Gregory Blaxland, William Lawson and William Wentworth crossed the Blue Mountains west of Sydney, opening the interior to European settlement.[78] The British claim was extended to the whole Australian continent in 1827 when Major Edmund Lockyer established a settlement on King George Sound (modern-day Albany).[79] The Swan River Colony (present-day Perth) was established in 1829, evolving into the largest Australian colony by area, Western Australia.[80] In accordance with population growth, separate colonies were carved from parts of New South Wales: South Australia in 1836, New Zealand in 1841, Victoria in 1851, and Queensland in 1859.[81] The Northern Territory was excised from South Australia in 1911.[82] South Australia was founded as a ""free province"" — it was never a penal colony.[83] Western Australia was also founded ""free"" but later accepted transported convicts, the last of which arrived in 1868, decades after transportation had ceased to the other colonies.[84] In the mid-19th century, explorers such as Burke and Wills went further inland to determine its agricultural potential and answer scientific questions.[85] A series of gold rushes beginning in the early 1850s led to an influx of new migrants from China, North America and continental Europe,[86] and also spurred outbreaks of bushranging and civil unrest; the latter peaked in 1854 when Ballarat miners launched the Eureka Rebellion against gold license fees.[87] Between 1855 and 1890, the six colonies individually gained responsible government, managing most of their own affairs while remaining part of the British Empire.[88] The Colonial Office in London retained control of some matters, notably foreign affairs[89] and defence.[90] Nationhood The Last Post is played at an Anzac Day ceremony in Port Melbourne, Victoria. Similar ceremonies are held in many suburbs and towns. On 1 January 1901, federation of the colonies was achieved after a decade of planning, consultation and voting.[91] After the 1907 Imperial Conference, Australia and the other self-governing British colonies were given the status of ""dominion"" within the British Empire.[92][93] The Federal Capital Territory (later renamed the Australian Capital Territory) was formed in 1911 as the location for the future federal capital of Canberra. Melbourne was the temporary seat of government from 1901 to 1927 while Canberra was being constructed.[94] The Northern Territory was transferred from the control of the South Australian government to the federal parliament in 1911.[95] Australia became the colonial ruler of the Territory of Papua (which had initially been annexed by Queensland in 1883[96]) in 1902 and of the Territory of New Guinea (formerly German New Guinea) in 1920. The two were unified as the Territory of Papua and New Guinea in 1949 and gained independence from Australia in 1975.[97][98][99] In 1914, Australia joined Britain in fighting World War I, with support from both the outgoing Commonwealth Liberal Party and the incoming Australian Labor Party.[100][101] Australians took part in many of the major battles fought on the Western Front.[102] Of about 416,000 who served, about 60,000 were killed and another 152,000 were wounded.[103] Many Australians regard the defeat of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZACs) at Gallipoli as the birth of the nation — its first major military action.[104][105] The Kokoda Track campaign is regarded by many as an analogous nation-defining event during World War II.[106] Britain's Statute of Westminster 1931 formally ended most of the constitutional links between Australia and the United Kingdom. Australia adopted it in 1942,[107] but it was backdated to 1939 to confirm the validity of legislation passed by the Australian Parliament during World War II.[108][109] The shock of Britain's defeat in Asia in 1942, followed soon after by the bombing of Darwin and other Japanese attacks, led to a widespread belief in Australia that an invasion was imminent, and a shift towards the United States as a new ally and protector.[110] Since 1951, Australia has been a formal military ally of the United States, under the ANZUS treaty.[111] After World War II, Australia encouraged immigration from mainland Europe. Since the 1970s and following the abolition of the White Australia policy, immigration from Asia and elsewhere was also promoted.[112] As a result, Australia's demography, culture, and self-image were transformed.[113] The Australia Act 1986 severed the remaining constitutional ties between Australia and the United Kingdom.[114] In a 1999 referendum, 55% of voters and a majority in every state rejected a proposal to become a republic with a president appointed by a two-thirds vote in both Houses of the Australian Parliament. There has been an increasing focus in foreign policy on ties with other Pacific Rim nations while maintaining close ties with Australia's traditional allies and trading partners.[115] Geography and environment Main articles: Geography of Australia and Environment of Australia See also: Environmental issues in Australia General characteristics Topographic map of Australia. Dark green represents the lowest elevation and dark brown the highest Surrounded by the Indian and Pacific oceans,[N 7] Australia is separated from Asia by the Arafura and Timor seas, with the Coral Sea lying off the Queensland coast, and the Tasman Sea lying between Australia and New Zealand. The world's smallest continent[117] and sixth largest country by total area,[118] Australia—owing to its size and isolation—is often dubbed the ""island continent""[119] and is sometimes considered the world's largest island.[120] Australia has 34,218 km (21,262 mi) of coastline (excluding all offshore islands),[121] and claims an extensive Exclusive Economic Zone of 8,148,250 square kilometres (3,146,060 sq mi). This exclusive economic zone does not include the Australian Antarctic Territory.[122] Mainland Australia lies between latitudes 9° and 44° South, and longitudes 112° and 154° East.[123] Australia's size gives it a wide variety of landscapes, with tropical rainforests in the north-east, mountain ranges in the south-east, south-west and east, and desert in the centre.[124] The desert or semi-arid land commonly known as the outback makes up by far the largest portion of land.[125] Australia is the driest inhabited continent; its annual rainfall averaged over continental area is less than 500 mm.[126] The population density is 3.2 inhabitants per square kilometre, although a large proportion of the population lives along the temperate south-eastern coastline.[127] Heron Island, a coral cay in the southern Great Barrier Reef The Great Barrier Reef, the world's largest coral reef,[128] lies a short distance off the north-east coast and extends for over 2,000 km (1,200 mi). Mount Augustus, claimed to be the world's largest monolith,[129] is located in Western Australia. At 2,228 m (7,310 ft), Mount Kosciuszko is the highest mountain on the Australian mainland. Even taller are Mawson Peak (at 2,745 m (9,006 ft)), on the remote Australian external territory of Heard Island, and, in the Australian Antarctic Territory, Mount McClintock and Mount Menzies, at 3,492 m (11,457 ft) and 3,355 m (11,007 ft) respectively.[130] Eastern Australia is marked by the Great Dividing Range, which runs parallel to the coast of Queensland, New South Wales and much of Victoria. The name is not strictly accurate, because parts of the range consist of low hills, and the highlands are typically no more than 1,600 m (5,200 ft) in height.[131] The coastal uplands and a belt of Brigalow grasslands lie between the coast and the mountains, while inland of the dividing range are large areas of grassland and shrubland.[131][132] These include the western plains of New South Wales, and the Mitchell Grass Downs and Mulga Lands of inland Queensland.[133][134][135][136] The northernmost point of the mainland is the tropical Cape York Peninsula.[123] Uluru in the semi-arid region of Central Australia The landscapes of the Top End and the Gulf Country—with their tropical climate—include forest, woodland, wetland, grassland, rainforest and desert.[137][138][139] At the north-west corner of the continent are the sandstone cliffs and gorges of The Kimberley, and below that the Pilbara. The Victoria Plains tropical savanna lies south of the Kimberly and Arnhem Land savannas, forming a transition between the coastal savannas and the interior deserts.[140][141][142] At the heart of the country are the uplands of central Australia. Prominent features of the centre and south include Uluru (also known as Ayers Rock), the famous sandstone monolith, and the inland Simpson, Tirari and Sturt Stony, Gibson, Great Sandy, Tanami, and Great Victoria deserts, with the famous Nullarbor Plain on the southern coast.[143][144][145][146] The Western Australian mulga shrublands lie between the interior deserts and Mediterranean-climate Southwest Australia.[145][147] Geology Main article: Geology of Australia Basic geological regions of Australia, by age. Lying on the Indo-Australian Plate, the mainland of Australia is the lowest and most primordial landmass on Earth with a relatively stable geological history.[148][149] The landmass includes virtually all known rock types and from all geological time periods spanning over 3.8 billion years of the Earth's history. The Pilbara Craton is one of only two pristine Archaean 3.6–2.7 Ga (billion years ago) crusts identified on the Earth.[150] Having been part of all major supercontinents, the Australian continent began to form after the breakup of Gondwana in the Permian, with the separation of the continental landmass from the African continent and Indian subcontinent. It separated from Antarctica over a prolonged period beginning in the Permian and continuing through to the Cretaceous.[151] When the last glacial period ended in about 10,000 BC, rising sea levels formed Bass Strait, separating Tasmania from the mainland. Then between about 8,000 and 6,500 BC, the lowlands in the north were flooded by the sea, separating New Guinea, the Aru Islands, and the mainland of Australia.[152] The Australian continent is moving toward Eurasia at the rate of 6 to 7 centimetres a year.[153] The Australian mainland's continental crust, excluding the thinned margins, has an average thickness of 38 km, with a range in thickness from 24 km to 59 km.[154] Australia's geology can be divided into several main sections, showcasing that the continent grew from west to east: the Archaean cratonic shields found mostly in the west, Proterozoic fold belts in the centre and Phanerozoic sedimentary basins, metamorphic and igneous rocks in the east.[155] The Australian mainland and Tasmania are situated in the middle of the tectonic plate and have no active volcanoes,[156] but due to passing over the East Australia hotspot, recent volcanism has occurred during the Holocene, in the Newer Volcanics Province of western Victoria and southeastern South Australia. Volcanism also occurs in the island of New Guinea (considered geologically as part of the Australian continent), and in the Australian external territory of Heard Island and McDonald Islands.[157] Seismic activity in the Australian mainland and Tasmania is also low, with the greatest number of fatalities having occurred in the 1989 Newcastle earthquake.[158] Climate Main article: Climate of Australia Köppen climate types of Australia.[159] The climate of Australia is significantly influenced by ocean currents, including the Indian Ocean Dipole and the El Niño–Southern Oscillation, which is correlated with periodic drought, and the seasonal tropical low-pressure system that produces cyclones in northern Australia.[160][161] These factors cause rainfall to vary markedly from year to year. Much of the northern part of the country has a tropical, predominantly summer-rainfall (monsoon).[126] The south-west corner of the country has a Mediterranean climate.[162] The south-east ranges from oceanic (Tasmania and coastal Victoria) to humid subtropical (upper half of New South Wales), with the highlands featuring alpine and subpolar oceanic climates. The interior is arid to semi-arid.[126] Driven by climate change, average temperatures have risen more than 1°C since 1960. Associated changes in rainfall patterns and climate extremes exacerbate existing issues such as drought and bushfires. 2019 was Australia's warmest recorded year,[163] and the 2019–2020 bushfire season was the country's worst on record.[164] Australia's greenhouse gas emissions per capita are among the highest in the world.[165] Water restrictions are frequently in place in many regions and cities of Australia in response to chronic shortages due to urban population increases and localised drought.[166][167] Throughout much of the continent, major flooding regularly follows extended periods of drought, flushing out inland river systems, overflowing dams and inundating large inland flood plains, as occurred throughout Eastern Australia in the early 2010s after the 2000s Australian drought.[168] Biodiversity See also: Fauna of Australia, Flora of Australia, and Fungi of Australia The koala and the eucalyptus form an iconic Australian pair. Although most of Australia is semi-arid or desert, the continent includes a diverse range of habitats from alpine heaths to tropical rainforests. Fungi typify that diversity—an estimated 250,000 species—of which only 5% have been described—occur in Australia.[169] Because of the continent's great age, extremely variable weather patterns, and long-term geographic isolation, much of Australia's biota is unique. About 85% of flowering plants, 84% of mammals, more than 45% of birds, and 89% of in-shore, temperate-zone fish are endemic.[170] Australia has at least 755 species of reptile, more than any other country in the world.[171] Besides Antarctica, Australia is the only continent that developed without feline species. Feral cats may have been introduced in the 17th century by Dutch shipwrecks, and later in the 18th century by European settlers. They are now considered a major factor in the decline and extinction of many vulnerable and endangered native species.[172] Australia is also one of 17 megadiverse countries.[173] Australian forests are mostly made up of evergreen species, particularly eucalyptus trees in the less arid regions; wattles replace them as the dominant species in drier regions and deserts.[174] Among well-known Australian animals are the monotremes (the platypus and echidna); a host of marsupials, including the kangaroo, koala, and wombat, and birds such as the emu and the kookaburra.[174] Australia is home to many dangerous animals including some of the most venomous snakes in the world.[175] The dingo was introduced by Austronesian people who traded with Indigenous Australians around 3000 BCE.[176] Many animal and plant species became extinct soon after first human settlement,[177] including the Australian megafauna; others have disappeared since European settlement, among them the thylacine.[178][179] Many of Australia's ecoregions, and the species within those regions, are threatened by human activities and introduced animal, chromistan, fungal and plant species.[180] All these factors have led to Australia's having the highest mammal extinction rate of any country in the world.[181] The federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 is the legal framework for the protection of threatened species.[182] Numerous protected areas have been created under the National Strategy for the Conservation of Australia's Biological Diversity to protect and preserve unique ecosystems;[183][184] 65 wetlands are listed under the Ramsar Convention,[185] and 16 natural World Heritage Sites have been established.[186] Australia was ranked 21st out of 178 countries in the world on the 2018 Environmental Performance Index.[187] There are more than 1,800 animals and plants on Australia's threatened species list, including more than 500 animals.[188] Government and politics Main articles: Government of Australia and Politics of Australia Elizabeth II, Queen of AustraliaDavid Hurley, Governor-General of AustraliaScott Morrison, Prime Minister of Australia Australia is a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy.[189] The country has maintained a stable liberal democratic political system under its constitution, which is one of the world's oldest, since Federation in 1901. It is also one of the world's oldest federations, in which power is divided between the federal and state and territorial governments. The Australian system of government combines elements derived from the political systems of the United Kingdom (a fused executive, constitutional monarchy and strong party discipline) and the United States (federalism, a written constitution and strong bicameralism with an elected upper house), along with distinctive indigenous features.[190][191] The federal government is separated into three branches:[192] Legislature: the bicameral Parliament, comprising the monarch (represented by the governor-general), the Senate, and the House of Representatives; Executive: the Federal Executive Council, which in practice gives legal effect to the decisions of the cabinet, comprising the prime minister and other ministers of state appointed by the governor-general on the advice of Parliament;[193] Judiciary: the High Court of Australia and other federal courts, whose judges are appointed by the governor-general on advice of Parliament Elizabeth II reigns as Queen of Australia and is represented in Australia by the governor-general at the federal level and by the governors at the state level, who by convention act on the advice of her ministers.[194][195] Thus, in practice the governor-general acts as a legal figurehead for the actions of the prime minister and the Federal Executive Council. The governor-general does have extraordinary reserve powers which may be exercised outside the prime minister's request in rare and limited circumstances, the most notable exercise of which was the dismissal of the Whitlam Government in the constitutional crisis of 1975.[196] Parliament House, Canberra In the Senate (the upper house), there are 76 senators: twelve each from the states and two each from the mainland territories (the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory).[197] The House of Representatives (the lower house) has 151 members elected from single-member electoral divisions, commonly known as ""electorates"" or ""seats"", allocated to states on the basis of population,[198] with each original state guaranteed a minimum of five seats.[199] Elections for both chambers are normally held every three years simultaneously; senators have overlapping six-year terms except for those from the territories, whose terms are not fixed but are tied to the electoral cycle for the lower house; thus only 40 of the 76 places in the Senate are put to each election unless the cycle is interrupted by a double dissolution.[197] Australia's electoral system uses preferential voting for all lower house elections with the exception of Tasmania and the ACT which, along with the Senate and most state upper houses, combine it with proportional representation in a system known as the single transferable vote. Voting is compulsory for all enrolled citizens 18 years and over in every jurisdiction,[200] as is enrolment.[201] The party with majority support in the House of Representatives forms the government and its leader becomes Prime Minister. In cases where no party has majority support, the Governor-General has the constitutional power to appoint the Prime Minister and, if necessary, dismiss one that has lost the confidence of Parliament.[202] Due to the relatively unique position of Australia operating as a Westminster Parliamentary democracy with an elected upper house, the system has sometimes been referred to as having a ""Washminster mutation"",[203] or as a Semi-parliamentary system.[204] There are two major political groups that usually form government, federally and in the states: the Australian Labor Party and the Coalition which is a formal grouping of the Liberal Party and its minor partner, the National Party.[205][206] Within Australian political culture, the Coalition is considered centre-right and the Labor Party is considered centre-left.[207] Independent members and several minor parties have achieved representation in Australian parliaments, mostly in upper houses. The Australian Greens are often considered the ""third force"" in politics, being the third largest party by both vote and membership.[208] The most recent federal election was held on 18 May 2019 and resulted in the Coalition, led by Prime Minister Scott Morrison, retaining government.[209] States and territories Main article: States and territories of Australia A map of Australia's states and territories Australia has six states — New South Wales (NSW), Queensland (QLD), South Australia (SA), Tasmania (TAS), Victoria (VIC) and Western Australia (WA) — and two major mainland territories—the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and the Northern Territory (NT). In most respects, these two territories function as states, except that the Commonwealth Parliament has the power to modify or repeal any legislation passed by the territory parliaments.[210] Under the constitution, the states essentially have plenary legislative power to legislate on any subject, whereas the Commonwealth (federal) Parliament may legislate only within the subject areas enumerated under section 51. For example, state parliaments have the power to legislate with respect to education, criminal law and state police, health, transport, and local government, but the Commonwealth Parliament does not have any specific power to legislate in these areas.[211] However, Commonwealth laws prevail over state laws to the extent of the inconsistency.[212] Each state and major mainland territory has its own parliament — unicameral in the Northern Territory, the ACT and Queensland, and bicameral in the other states. The states are sovereign entities, although subject to certain powers of the Commonwealth as defined by the Constitution. The lower houses are known as the Legislative Assembly (the House of Assembly in South Australia and Tasmania); the upper houses are known as the Legislative Council. The head of the government in each state is the Premier and in each territory the Chief Minister. The Queen is represented in each state by a governor; and in the Northern Territory, the administrator.[213] In the Commonwealth, the Queen's representative is the governor-general.[214] The Commonwealth Parliament also directly administers the external territories of Ashmore and Cartier Islands, Christmas Island, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, the Coral Sea Islands, Heard Island and McDonald Islands, and the claimed region of Australian Antarctic Territory, as well as the internal Jervis Bay Territory, a naval base and sea port for the national capital in land that was formerly part of New South Wales.[193] The external territory of Norfolk Island previously exercised considerable autonomy under the Norfolk Island Act 1979 through its own legislative assembly and an Administrator to represent the Queen.[215] In 2015, the Commonwealth Parliament abolished self-government, integrating Norfolk Island into the Australian tax and welfare systems and replacing its legislative assembly with a council.[216] Macquarie Island is part of Tasmania,[217] and Lord Howe Island of New South Wales.[218] Foreign relations Main article: Foreign relations of Australia Australia's Minister for Foreign Affairs, Marise Payne. Over recent decades, Australia's foreign relations have been driven by a close association with the United States through the ANZUS pact, and by a desire to develop relationships with Asia and the Pacific, particularly through Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Pacific Islands Forum and the Pacific Community, of which Australia is a founding member. In 2005, Australia secured an inaugural seat at the East Asia Summit following its accession to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia, and in 2011 attended the Sixth East Asia Summit in Indonesia. Australia is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, in which the Commonwealth Heads of Government meetings provide the main forum for co-operation.[219] Australia has pursued the cause of international trade liberalisation.[220] It led the formation of the Cairns Group and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation.[221][222] Australia is a member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the World Trade Organization (WTO),[223][224] and has pursued several major bilateral free trade agreements, most recently the Australia–United States Free Trade Agreement[225] and Closer Economic Relations with New Zealand,[226] with another free trade agreement being negotiated with China — the Australia–China Free Trade Agreement — and Japan,[227] South Korea in 2011,[228][229] Australia–Chile Free Trade Agreement, and as of November 2015[update] has put the Trans-Pacific Partnership before parliament for ratification.[230] Australia maintains a deeply integrated relationship with neighbouring New Zealand, with free mobility of citizens between the two countries under the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement and free trade under the Australia–New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement.[231] New Zealand, Canada and the United Kingdom are the most favourably viewed countries in the world by Australian people.[232][233] Along with New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Malaysia and Singapore, Australia is party to the Five Power Defence Arrangements, a regional defence agreement. A founding member country of the United Nations, Australia is strongly committed to multilateralism[234] and maintains an international aid program under which some 60 countries receive assistance. The 2005–2006 budget provides AU$2.5 billion for development assistance.[235] Australia ranks fifteenth overall in the Center for Global Development's 2012 Commitment to Development Index.[236] Military Main article: Australian Defence Force Australian soldiers deployed to Iraq in 2017. Australia's armed forces—the Australian Defence Force (ADF) — comprise the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), the Australian Army and the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), in total numbering 81,214 personnel (including 57,982 regulars and 23,232 reservists) as of November 2015[update]. The titular role of Commander-in-Chief is vested in the Governor-General, who appoints a Chief of the Defence Force from one of the armed services on the advice of the government.[237] In a diarchy, the CDF serves as co-chairman of the Defence Committee, conjointly with the Secretary of Defence, in the command and control of the Australian Defence Organisation.[238] In the 2016–2017 budget, defence spending comprised 2% of GDP, representing the world's 12th largest defence budget.[239] Australia has been involved in United Nations and regional peacekeeping, disaster relief and armed conflict, including the 2003 invasion of Iraq; Australia currently has deployed about 2,241 personnel in varying capacities to 12 international operations in areas including Iraq and Afghanistan.[240] Economy Main article: Economy of Australia See also: Economic history of Australia, Median household income in Australia and New Zealand, and Transport in Australia A proportional representation of Australia exports, 2019 A wealthy country, Australia has a market economy, a high GDP per capita, and a relatively low rate of poverty. In terms of average wealth, Australia ranked second in the world after Switzerland from 2013 until 2018.[241] In 2018, Australia overtook Switzerland and became the country with the highest average wealth.[241] Australia's relative poverty rate is 13.6%.[242] It was identified by the Credit Suisse Research Institute as the nation with the highest median wealth in the world and the second-highest average wealth per adult in 2013.[243] The Australian dollar is the currency for the nation, including Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, and Norfolk Island, as well as the independent Pacific Island states of Kiribati, Nauru, and Tuvalu. With the 2006 merger of the Australian Stock Exchange and the Sydney Futures Exchange, the Australian Securities Exchange became the ninth largest in the world.[244] Australian energy resources and major export ports map Ranked fifth in the Index of Economic Freedom (2017),[245] Australia is the world's 13th largest economy and has the tenth highest per capita GDP (nominal) at US$55,692.[246] The country was ranked third in the United Nations 2017 Human Development Index.[247] Melbourne reached top spot for the fourth year in a row on The Economist's 2014 list of the world's most liveable cities,[248] followed by Adelaide, Sydney, and Perth in the fifth, seventh, and ninth places respectively. Total government debt in Australia is about A$190 billion[249]—20% of GDP in 2010.[250] Australia has among the highest house prices and some of the highest household debt levels in the world.[251] An emphasis on exporting commodities rather than manufactured goods has underpinned a significant increase in Australia's terms of trade since the start of the 21st century, due to rising commodity prices. Australia has a balance of payments that is more than 7% of GDP negative, and has had persistently large current account deficits for more than 50 years.[252] Australia has grown at an average annual rate of 3.6% for over 15 years, in comparison to the OECD annual average of 2.5%.[252] Australia was the only advanced economy not to experience a recession due to the global financial downturn in 2008–2009.[253] However, the economies of six of Australia's major trading partners were in recession, which in turn affected Australia, significantly hampering its economic growth.[254][255] From 2012 to early 2013, Australia's national economy grew, but some non-mining states and Australia's non-mining economy experienced a recession.[256][257][258] The Boddington Gold Mine in Western Australia is the nation's largest open cut mine.[259] The Hawke Government floated the Australian dollar in 1983 and partially deregulated the financial system.[260] The Howard Government followed with a partial deregulation of the labour market and the further privatisation of state-owned businesses, most notably in the telecommunications industry.[261] The indirect tax system was substantially changed in July 2000 with the introduction of a 10% Goods and Services Tax (GST).[262] In Australia's tax system, personal and company income tax are the main sources of government revenue.[263] As of September 2018[update], there were 12,640,800 people employed (either full- or part-time), with an unemployment rate of 5.2%.[264] Data released in mid-November 2013 showed that the number of welfare recipients had grown by 55%. In 2007 228,621 Newstart unemployment allowance recipients were registered, a total that increased to 646,414 in March 2013.[265] According to the Graduate Careers Survey, full-time employment for newly qualified professionals from various occupations has declined since 2011 but it increases for graduates three years after graduation.[266][267] As of 2020[update] interest rates in Australia were set at a record low of 0.1%, targeting an inflation rate of 2 to 3%.[268] The service sector of the economy, including tourism, education, and financial services, accounts for about 70% of GDP.[269] Rich in natural resources, Australia is a major exporter of agricultural products, particularly wheat and wool, minerals such as iron-ore and gold, and energy in the forms of liquified natural gas and coal. Although agriculture and natural resources account for only 3% and 5% of GDP respectively, they contribute substantially to export performance. Australia's largest export markets are Japan, China, the United States, South Korea, and New Zealand.[270] Australia is the world's fourth largest exporter of wine, and the wine industry contributes A$5.5 billion per year to the nation's economy.[271] Access to biocapacity in Australia is much higher than world average. In 2016, Australia had 12.3 global hectares[272] of biocapacity per person within its territory, much more than the world average of 1.6 global hectares per person.[273] In 2016 Australia used 6.6 global hectares of biocapacity per person – their ecological footprint of consumption. This means they use half as much biocapacity as Australia contains. As a result, Australia is running a biocapacity reserve.[272] In 2020 the Australian Council of Social Service released a report stating that relative poverty was growing in Australia, with an estimated 3.2 million people, or 13.6% of the population, living below an internationally accepted relative poverty threshold of 50% of a country's median income. It also estimated that there were 774,000 (17.7%) children under the age of 15 in relative poverty.[274][275] Demographics Main article: Demography of Australia For a more comprehensive list, see List of cities in Australia by population. Australia has one of the world's most highly urbanised populations with the majority living in metropolitan cities on the coast, such as Gold Coast, Queensland. Australia has an average population density of 3.4 persons per square kilometre of total land area, which makes it one of the most sparsely populated countries in the world. The population is heavily concentrated on the east coast, and in particular in the south-eastern region between South East Queensland to the north-east and Adelaide to the south-west.[276] Australia is highly urbanised, with 67% of the population living in the Greater Capital City Statistical Areas (metropolitan areas of the state and mainland territorial capital cities) in 2018.[277] Metropolitan areas with more than one million inhabitants are Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide.[278] In common with many other developed countries, Australia is experiencing a demographic shift towards an older population, with more retirees and fewer people of working age. In 2018 the average age of the Australian population was 38.8 years.[279] In 2015, 2.15% of the Australian population lived overseas, one of the lowest proportions worldwide.[280] vte Largest populated areas in Australia2019 data from Australian Bureau of Statistics[281] Rank Name State Pop.

In the decades immediately following the Second World War, Australia received a large wave of immigration from across Europe, with many more immigrants arriving from Southern and Eastern Europe than in previous decades. Since the end of the White Australia policy in 1973, Australia has pursued an official policy of multiculturalism,[283] and there has been a large and continuing wave of immigration from across the world, with Asia being the largest source of immigrants in the 21st century.[284] Today, Australia has the world's eighth-largest immigrant population, with immigrants accounting for 30% of the population, the highest proportion among major Western nations.[28][285] 160,323 permanent immigrants were admitted to Australia in 2018–2019 (excluding refugees),[284] whilst there was a net population gain of 239,600 people from all permanent and temporary immigration in that year.[286] The majority of immigrants are skilled,[284] but the immigration program includes categories for family members and refugees.[286] In 2020, the largest foreign-born populations were those born in England (3.8%), India (2.8%), Mainland China (2.5%), New Zealand (2.2%), the Philippines (1.2%) and Vietnam (1.1%).[287] In the 2016 Australian census, the most commonly nominated ancestries were:[N 9][288][289] English (36.1%) Australian (33.5%)[N 10] Irish (11.0%) Scottish (9.3%) Chinese (5.6%) Italian (4.6%) German (4.5%) Indian (2.8%) Indigenous (2.8%)[N 11] Greek (1.8%) Dutch (1.6%) Filipino (1.4%) Vietnamese (1.4%) Lebanese (1%) At the 2016 census, 649,171 people (2.8% of the total population) identified as being Indigenous — Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders.[N 12][291] Indigenous Australians experience higher than average rates of imprisonment and unemployment, lower levels of education, and life expectancies for males and females that are, respectively, 11 and 17 years lower than those of non-indigenous Australians.[270][292][293] Some remote Indigenous communities have been described as having ""failed state""-like conditions.[294] Language Main article: Languages of Australia Although Australia has no official language, English is the de facto national language.[2] Australian English is a major variety of the language with a distinctive accent and lexicon,[295] and differs slightly from other varieties of English in grammar and spelling.[296] General Australian serves as the standard dialect.[297] According to the 2016 census, English is the only language spoken in the home for 72.7% of the population. The next most common languages spoken at home are Mandarin (2.5%), Arabic (1.4%), Cantonese (1.2%), Vietnamese (1.2%) and Italian (1.2%).[288] Over 250 Indigenous Australian languages are thought to have existed at the time of first European contact,[298] of which fewer than twenty are still in daily use by all age groups.[299][300] About 110 others are spoken exclusively by older people.[300] At the time of the 2006 census, 52,000 Indigenous Australians, representing 12% of the Indigenous population, reported that they spoke an Indigenous language at home.[301] Australia has a sign language known as Auslan, which is the main language of about 10,112 deaf people who reported that they spoke Auslan language at home in the 2016 census.[302] Religion Main article: Religion in Australia Religion in Australia (2016)[303] Religion Percent Christianity (total) 52.1% —Catholic 22.6% —Other Christian 16.3% —Anglican 13.3% Islam 2.6% Buddhism 2.4% Hinduism 1.9% Sikhism 0.5% Judaism 0.4% Other 0.4% No religion 30.1% Undefined or not stated 9.7% Australia has no state religion; Section 116 of the Australian Constitution prohibits the federal government from making any law to establish any religion, impose any religious observance, or prohibit the free exercise of any religion.[304] In the 2016 census, 52.1% of Australians were counted as Christian, including 22.6% as Catholic and 13.3% as Anglican; 30.1% of the population reported having ""no religion""; 8.2% identify with non-Christian religions, the largest of these being Islam (2.6%), followed by Buddhism (2.4%), Hinduism (1.9%), Sikhism (0.5%) and Judaism (0.4%). The remaining 9.7% of the population did not provide an adequate answer. Those who reported having no religion increased conspicuously from 19% in 2006 to 22% in 2011 to 30.1% in 2016.[303] Before European settlement, the animist beliefs of Australia's indigenous people had been practised for many thousands of years. Mainland Aboriginal Australians' spirituality is known as the Dreaming and it places a heavy emphasis on belonging to the land. The collection of stories that it contains shaped Aboriginal law and customs. Aboriginal art, story and dance continue to draw on these spiritual traditions. The spirituality and customs of Torres Strait Islanders, who inhabit the islands between Australia and New Guinea, reflected their Melanesian origins and dependence on the sea. The 1996 Australian census counted more than 7000 respondents as followers of a traditional Aboriginal religion.[305] Since the arrival of the First Fleet of British ships in 1788, Christianity has become the major religion practised in Australia. Christian churches have played an integral role in the development of education, health and welfare services in Australia. For much of Australian history, the Church of England (now known as the Anglican Church of Australia) was the largest religious denomination, with a large Roman Catholic minority. However, multicultural immigration has contributed to a steep decline in its relative position since the Second World War. Similarly, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, Sikhism and Judaism have all grown in Australia over the past half-century.[306] Australia has one of the lowest levels of religious adherence in the world.[307] In 2018, 13% of women and 10% of men reported attending church at least weekly.[308] Health See also: Health care in Australia Australia's life expectancy is the fourth highest in the world for males and the third highest for females.[309] Life expectancy in Australia in 2014–2016 was 80.4 years for males and 84.6 years for females.[310] Australia has the highest rates of skin cancer in the world,[311] while cigarette smoking is the largest preventable cause of death and disease, responsible for 7.8% of the total mortality and disease. Ranked second in preventable causes is hypertension at 7.6%, with obesity third at 7.5%.[312][313] Australia ranks 35th in the world[314] and near the top of developed nations for its proportion of obese adults[315] and nearly two thirds (63%) of its adult population is either overweight or obese.[316] Total expenditure on health (including private sector spending) is around 9.8% of GDP.[317] Australia introduced universal health care in 1975.[318] Known as Medicare, it is now nominally funded by an income tax surcharge known as the Medicare levy, currently at 2%.[319] The states manage hospitals and attached outpatient services, while the Commonwealth funds the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (subsidising the costs of medicines) and general practice.[318] Education Main article: Education in Australia Five Australian universities rank in the top 50 of the QS World University Rankings, including the Australian National University (19th).[320] School attendance, or registration for home schooling,[321] is compulsory throughout Australia. Education is the responsibility of the individual states and territories[322] so the rules vary between states, but in general children are required to attend school from the age of about 5 until about 16.[323][324] In some states (e.g., Western Australia, the Northern Territory and New South Wales), children aged 16–17 are required to either attend school or participate in vocational training, such as an apprenticeship.[325][326][327][328] Australia has an adult literacy rate that was estimated to be 99% in 2003.[329] However, a 2011–2012 report for the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that Tasmania has a literacy and numeracy rate of only 50%.[330] Australia has 37 government-funded universities and three private universities, as well as a number of other specialist institutions that provide approved courses at the higher education level.[331] The OECD places Australia among the most expensive nations to attend university.[332] There is a state-based system of vocational training, known as TAFE, and many trades conduct apprenticeships for training new tradespeople.[333] About 58% of Australians aged from 25 to 64 have vocational or tertiary qualifications,[270] and the tertiary graduation rate of 49% is the highest among OECD countries. 30.9% of Australia's population has attained a higher education qualification, which is among the highest percentages in the world.[334][335][336] Australia has the highest ratio of international students per head of population in the world by a large margin, with 812,000 international students enrolled in the nation's universities and vocational institutions in 2019.[337][338] Accordingly, in 2019, international students represented on average 26.7% of the student bodies of Australian universities. International education therefore represents one of the country's largest exports and has a pronounced influence on the country's demographics, with a significant proportion of international students remaining in Australia after graduation on various skill and employment visas.[339] Infrastructure Energy Main articles: Energy policy of Australia and Renewable energy in Australia In 2003, Australia's energy sources were coal (58.4%), hydropower (19.1%), natural gas (13.5%), liquid/gas fossil fuel-switching plants (5.4%), oil (2.9%), and other renewable resources like wind power, solar energy, and bioenergy (0.7%).[340] During the 21st century, Australia has been trending to generate more energy using renewable resources and less energy using fossil fuels. In 2020, Australia used coal for 62% of all energy (3.6% increase compared to 2013), wind power for 9.9% (9.5% increase), natural gas for 9.9% (3.6% decrease), solar power for 9.9% (9.8% increase), hydropower for 6.4% (12.7% decrease), bioenergy for 1.4% (1.2% increase), and other sources like oil and waste coal mine gas for 0.5%.[341][342] In August 2009, Australia's government set a goal to achieve 20% of all energy in the country from renewable sources by 2020.[343] They achieved this goal, as renewable resources accounted for 27.7% of Australia's energy in 2020.[341] Culture Main article: Culture of Australia The Royal Exhibition Building in Melbourne was the first building in Australia to be listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2004.[344] Since 1788, the primary influence behind Australian culture has been Anglo-Celtic Western culture, with some Indigenous influences.[345][346] The divergence and evolution that has occurred in the ensuing centuries has resulted in a distinctive Australian culture.[347][348] The culture of the United States has served as a significant influence, particularly through television and cinema. Other cultural influences come from neighbouring Asian countries, and through large-scale immigration from non-English-speaking nations.[349] Arts Main articles: Australian art, Australian literature, Theatre of Australia, and Dance in Australia Australia has over 100,000 Aboriginal rock art sites,[350] and traditional designs, patterns and stories infuse contemporary Indigenous Australian art, ""the last great art movement of the 20th century"" according to critic Robert Hughes;[351] its exponents include Emily Kame Kngwarreye.[352] Early colonial artists showed a fascination with the unfamiliar land.[353] The impressionistic works of Arthur Streeton, Tom Roberts and other members of the 19th-century Heidelberg School—the first ""distinctively Australian"" movement in Western art—gave expression to nationalist sentiments in the lead-up to Federation.[353] While the school remained influential into the 1900s, modernists such as Margaret Preston, and, later, Sidney Nolan and Arthur Boyd, explored new artistic trends.[353] The landscape remained a central subject matter for Fred Williams, Brett Whiteley and other post-war artists whose works, eclectic in style yet uniquely Australian, moved between the figurative and the abstract.[353][354] The national and state galleries maintain collections of local and international art.[355] Australia has one of the world's highest attendances of art galleries and museums per head of population.[356] Sidney Nolan's Snake mural (1970), held at the Museum of Old and New Art in Hobart, Tasmania, is inspired by the Aboriginal creation myth of the Rainbow Serpent, as well as desert flowers in bloom after a drought.[357] Australian literature grew slowly in the decades following European settlement though Indigenous oral traditions, many of which have since been recorded in writing, are much older.[358] In the 1870s, Adam Lindsay Gordon posthumously became the first Australian poet to attain a wide readership. Following in his footsteps, Henry Lawson and Banjo Paterson captured the experience of the bush using a distinctive Australian vocabulary.[359] Their works are still popular; Paterson's bush poem ""Waltzing Matilda"" (1895) is regarded as Australia's unofficial national anthem.[360] Miles Franklin is the namesake of Australia's most prestigious literary prize, awarded annually to the best novel about Australian life.[361] Its first recipient, Patrick White, went on to win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1973.[362] Australian Booker Prize winners include Peter Carey, Thomas Keneally and Richard Flanagan.[363] Authors David Malouf, Germaine Greer, Helen Garner, playwright David Williamson and poet Les Murray are also renowned.[364][365] Many of Australia's performing arts companies receive funding through the federal government's Australia Council.[366] There is a symphony orchestra in each state,[367] and a national opera company, Opera Australia,[368] well known for its famous soprano Joan Sutherland.[369] At the beginning of the 20th century, Nellie Melba was one of the world's leading opera singers.[370] Ballet and dance are represented by The Australian Ballet and various state companies. Each state has a publicly funded theatre company.[371] Media Main articles: Cinema of Australia, Television in Australia, Media of Australia, and Music of Australia Actor playing the bushranger Ned Kelly in The Story of the Kelly Gang (1906), the world's first feature-length narrative film The Story of the Kelly Gang (1906), the world's first feature-length narrative film, spurred a boom in Australian cinema during the silent film era.[372] After World War I, Hollywood monopolised the industry,[373] and by the 1960s Australian film production had effectively ceased.[374] With the benefit of government support, the Australian New Wave of the 1970s brought provocative and successful films, many exploring themes of national identity, such as Wake in Fright and Gallipoli,[375] while Crocodile Dundee and the Ozploitation movement's Mad Max series became international blockbusters.[376] In a film market flooded with foreign content, Australian films delivered a 7.7% share of the local box office in 2015.[377] The AACTAs are Australia's premier film and television awards, and notable Academy Award winners from Australia include Geoffrey Rush, Nicole Kidman, Cate Blanchett and Heath Ledger.[378] Australia has two public broadcasters (the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and the multicultural Special Broadcasting Service), three commercial television networks, several pay-TV services,[379] and numerous public, non-profit television and radio stations. Each major city has at least one daily newspaper,[379] and there are two national daily newspapers, The Australian and The Australian Financial Review.[379] In 2020, Reporters Without Borders placed Australia 25th on a list of 180 countries ranked by press freedom, behind New Zealand (8th) but ahead of the United Kingdom (33rd) and United States (44th).[380] This relatively low ranking is primarily because of the limited diversity of commercial media ownership in Australia;[381] most print media are under the control of News Corporation and Nine Entertainment Co.[382] Cuisine Main article: Australian cuisine The meringue-based pavlova is generally eaten at Christmas time. Most Indigenous Australian groups subsisted on a simple hunter-gatherer diet of native fauna and flora, otherwise called bush tucker.[383] The first settlers introduced British food to the continent, much of which is now considered typical Australian food, such as the Sunday roast.[384][385] Multicultural immigration transformed Australian cuisine; post-World War II European migrants, particularly from the Mediterranean, helped to build a thriving Australian coffee culture, and the influence of Asian cultures has led to Australian variants of their staple foods, such as the Chinese-inspired dim sim and Chiko Roll.[386] Vegemite, pavlova, lamingtons and meat pies are regarded as iconic Australian foods.[387] Australian wine is produced mainly in the southern, cooler parts of the country.[388] Australia is also known for its cafe and coffee culture in urban centres, which has influenced coffee culture abroad, including New York City.[389] Australia was responsible for the flat white coffee–purported to have originated in a Sydney cafe in the mid-1980s.[390] Sport and recreation Main article: Sport in Australia The Melbourne Cricket Ground is strongly associated with the history and development of cricket and Australian rules football, Australia's two most popular spectator sports.[391] Cricket and football are the predominate sports in Australia during the summer and winter months, respectively. Australia is unique in that it has professional leagues for four football codes. Originating in Melbourne in the 1850s, Australian rules football is the most popular code in all states except New South Wales and Queensland, where rugby league holds sway, followed by rugby union; the imaginary border separating areas where Australian rules football dominates from those were the two rugby codes prevail is known as the Barassi Line.[392] Soccer, while ranked fourth in popularity and resources, has the highest overall participation rates.[393] Cricket is popular across all borders and has been regarded by many Australians as the national sport. The Australian national cricket team competed against England in the first Test match (1877) and the first One Day International (1971), and against New Zealand in the first Twenty20 International (2004), winning all three games. It has also participated in every edition of the Cricket World Cup, winning the tournament a record five times.[394] Australia is also notable for water-based sports, such as swimming and surfing.[395] The surf lifesaving movement originated in Australia, and the volunteer lifesaver is one of the country's icons.[396] Nationally, other popular sports include horse racing, basketball, and motor racing. The annual Melbourne Cup horse race and the Sydney to Hobart yacht race attract intense interest.[397] In 2016, the Australian Sports Commission revealed that swimming, cycling and soccer are the three most popular participation sports.[398][399] Australia is one of five nations to have participated in every Summer Olympics of the modern era,[400] and has hosted the Games twice: 1956 in Melbourne and 2000 in Sydney.[401] It is also set to host the 2032 Games in Brisbane.[402] Australia has also participated in every Commonwealth Games,[403] hosting the event in 1938, 1962, 1982, 2006 and 2018.[404] Australia made its inaugural appearance at the Pacific Games in 2015. As well as being a regular FIFA World Cup participant, Australia has won the OFC Nations Cup four times and the AFC Asian Cup once—the only country to have won championships in two different FIFA confederations.[405] In June 2020, Australia won its bid to co-host the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup with New Zealand.[406][407] The country regularly competes among the world elite basketball teams as it is among the global top three teams in terms of qualifications to the Basketball Tournament at the Summer Olympics. Other major international events held in Australia include the Australian Open tennis grand slam tournament, international cricket matches, and the Australian Formula One Grand Prix. The highest-rating television programs include sports telecasts such as the Summer Olympics, FIFA World Cup, The Ashes, Rugby League State of Origin, and the grand finals of the National Rugby League and Australian Football League.[408] Skiing in Australia began in the 1860s and snow sports take place in the Australian Alps and parts of Tasmania.[409] See also Australia portal Oceania portal Outline of Australia Index of Australia-related articles Notes ^ Australia's royal anthem is ""God Save the Queen"", played in the presence of a member of the Royal family when they are in Australia.

Open Source Yes Language Availability English Country of Origin India Date of Development 2017 Version 1.0 Description The Green Rating for Integrated Habitat Assessment (GRIHA) is India’s national framework for the assessment of environmental impacts of built environments with an individual version applying to new buildings and one for existing buildings (both starting at 2,500 sqm built-up area). For both versions, the net impact of buildings on quantitative and qualitative parameters is totaled and compared against a rating table, resulting in a sustainability certification. Thereby, the tool aims to support the reduction of detrimental impacts of buildings. Tool Outcome Depending on the total point score, buildings receive a sustainability rating of one to five stars. Sustainability Criteria The sustainability of new buildings is assessed across a broad set of criteria clustered in eleven categories: – Sustainable site planning (3 criteria) – Construction management (3 criteria) – Energy efficiency (3 criteria) – Occupant comfort (3 criteria) – Water management (4 criteria) – Solid waste management (2 criteria) – Sustainable building materials (3 criteria) – Life cycle costing (1 criterion) – Socio-economic strategies (4 criteria) – Performance metering & monitoring (3 criteria) – Innovation (1 criterion) For existing buildings, the sustainability is assessed across six categories: – Site parameters (2 criteria) – Maintenance & housekeeping (2 criteria) – Energy (2 criteria) – Water (2 criteria) – Human health & comfort (2 criteria) – Social aspects (2 criteria) Link to Product https://www.grihaindia.org/ Manual for Existing Buildings | https://www.grihaindia.org/sites/default/files/pdf/Manuals/GRIHA_EB-Manual.pdf Case Studies India | https://www.grihaindia.org/projects Contact Information https://www.grihaindia.org/contact-us Registration Information Privacy Policy About Contact Implemented by: In collaboration with:",Griha Council

GRIHA V2019 Today, buildings have evolved into a diverse array of typologies designed to meet the highly specific requirements of the people who live and work in them. Over time, with our growing technological skills, these buildings have also been increasingly designed and operated to place exorbitant demands on natural resources, such as land, water, and energy, to mention a few. Therefore, incorporation of sustainable practices in building design and operation is no longer a choice but a necessity for a sustainable future. The GRIHA v.2015 has undergone an extensive revision to account for the ongoing advancements in the highly dynamic construction sector. This version (i.e. GRIHA v2019) integrates concepts like life cycle cost analysis, life cycle analysis, and water performance index to name a few. This version has taken into consideration the incorporation of user experience, market feedback, and enhanced ease of implementation and adoption. Eligibility All new construction projects with built up area more than 2500 m2 (excluding parking, basement area, and typical buildings) are eligible for certification under GRIHA v.2019. Rating Process Online registration: The project team can initiate the registration process by filling the EOI Form available on the GRIHA website. The process of registration is completed after the successful payment of registration fees by the project team. Once the project is registered, the project team is provided with a username and password for submitting the documentation on the GRIHA online panel. Orientation workshop: The registration is followed by an orientation workshop conducted by GRIHA Council officials, which intends to provide detailed information of the rating along with an elaborate explanation to all the criteria, and post addressing project-specific queries of the teams. Due diligence I: The site visit shall be conducted by GRIHA Council officials to validate sustainable measures adopted during the construction phase. It will be scheduled post the project has reached its plinth level. Due diligence II: The second site visit shall be conducted by the GRIHA Council officials to validate internal finishes, electrical, plumbing, and mechanical components installed during the construction phase. It is scheduled post completion of the building structure work. Submission of documents: As the project is nearing completion, the project proponent will upload the documents for all criteria on the online panel using the username and password provided at the time of registration. Preliminary evaluation: Preliminary evaluation is carried out by a team of professionals from GRIHA Council and external evaluators, who are experts in their respective fields recognized by GRIHA Council. Final due diligence: The final site visit shall be conducted by the GRIHA Council officials to verify the submitted documentation with on-site implementation. The visit is done once the project is complete and all equipment and systems are installed and commissioned. Final evaluation: The GRIHA Council officials along with external evaluators shall then evaluate the final round of submitted documentation and the final site visit report in response to the preliminary evaluation. The final rating is awarded based on the final evaluation and is valid up to 5 years. Additional due diligence Green awareness drive: The GRIHA Council conducts an additional due diligence visit post the final rating, for green awareness and education amongst project occupants. This visit aims to impart basic knowledge and understanding on green buildings and their way of working. Rating renewal: There are two ways in which the rating can be renewed and the project gets to enjoy the perks of being called a rated building.

Rating Process i. Registration A project must be registered with GRIHA Council through the GRIHA website by filling in the registration form online. Registration should preferably be done at beginning of a project, as several issues need to be addressed at the pre-design stage. The registration process includes access to the essential information related to rating. ii. Post-registration workshop An orientation workshop is conducted by the GRIHA Council, for the entire project team comprising of the owner, architect, MEP Consultants, landscape consultants, project manager, etc. The workshop serves the dual purpose of awareness of GRIHA System for all involved and identification and evaluation of the optional criteria to enhance the rating of the project. iii. Online Submission of documents The project proponent is required to provide documentary evidence to demonstrate compliance with the criteria. The required list of documents is mentioned in the criteria in the GRIHA Manual. All compliance documents shall be submitted through the online portal on the GRIHA website. Submitted documents will be checked and vetted by GRIHA Council. iv. Due Diligence Three site visits will be conducted as part of the rating process to verify the compliances on site. The first site visit will be done when the project is at plinth level, the second one will be done when the structural work is complete and interior finishing is in progress. The third and final site visit will be done after the preliminary document assessment by GRIHA. v. Evaluation process Complete and consolidated rating documents submitted by the project proponent shall be sent for a third-party review. Third party reviewers are identified and trained by the GRIHA Council under the supervision of the Technical Advisory Committee of GRIHA. On-site checks will be carried out by the GRIHA Council 3 times during the project execution phase for auditing the green features as part of the Due-Diligence visits. The submission summary report generated by the online portal will be sent to the evaluators. The evaluators will award provisional points and comment on specific criteria, if need be. The evaluation report will be sent to the project proponent to review the same and, if desired, take steps to increase the score. The report will have elaborate remarks of the evaluation committee along with comments. The report will list the criteria for which the documentation is incomplete, detailing the information, which is required. The project proponent will be given one-month time to resubmit the documents with necessary modifications /additions. The resubmitted documents will comprise only of the additional documents / information desired in the evaluation report. The resubmitted documents will again be put through the vetting process described above. The evaluation committee will then award the final score. The final score will be presented to the National Advisory committee comprising of eminent personalities and renowned professionals in the field, for approval and award of the provisional rating. Final award of rating will be subject to an independent energy audit of the project after a year of commissioning the building. Once rated, the rating will be valid for a period of five years from the date of commissioning of the building. GRIHA reserves the right to undertake a random on-site audit of any criteria for which points have been awarded. Note: It may please be noted that rating is subject to fulfilment of minimum requirements as necessary under GRIHA. Projects that do not fulfil mandatory criteria and minimum required optional criteria are not eligible for rating.

Cette journée a pour le thème ""Les énergies renouvelables, environnement durable et employabilité d’avenir"". Un rapport de l’Organisation internationale du travail (OIT) estime que l’économie verte pourrait créer de 15 à 60 millions d’emplois supplémentaires à l’échelle mondiale au cours des vingt prochaines années. En Algérie, l’étude de l’agence allemande GIZ a relevé que près de 600.000 personnes, en majorité des jeunes, travaillaient actuellement en Algérie dans des activités liées à l’économie verte en plus de 1,4 million d’emplois qui pourraient être créés en Algérie à l’horizon 2025 dans des activités liées à l’économie verte. Mais quelles sont réellement les opportunités de carrière ? Le secteur embauche-t-il ? Où sont les meilleures perspectives d’emploi en Algérie ? Cette journée d’étude a pour objectif de répondre à ces questions en impliquant plusieurs acteurs activant sur la scène nationale : collectivités locales, entreprises économiques, intervenants dans le secteur de l’agriculture, centres de recherche, universités et centres de formation. En marge de cette journée, il sera procédé à la signature d’une convention cadre de coopération scientifique et technologique entre le CDER et la Filiale Sonelgaz en charge des réseaux isolés du sud et des Energies Renouvelables, Shariket Kahraba oua Takat Moutadjadida (SKTM).

Notre monde est en perpétuelle mutation. Deux grands enjeux font parties des facteurs qui induisent cette mutation : ce sont l’énergie et l’environnement. La couverture énergétique mondiale est assurée par des sources dites traditionnelles (combustibles fossiles et nucléaires). Les combustibles fossiles produisent des gaz à effet de serre, responsables du réchauffement climatique et le stockage des déchets nucléaires pose problème. Aujourd’hui, tout le monde s’accorde à reconnaître que tout développement économique et social est impossible sans énergie. Ainsi, les besoins énergétiques ne cesseront de croître et le monde devra faire face à des pénuries de combustibles fossiles aussi bien qu’à des problèmes  d’ordre écologique. Les systèmes énergétiques du futur seront donc ceux qui n’auront pas un impact néfaste sur l’environnement et on rêve de plus en plus d’une source d’énergie inépuisable  et non polluante : une source d’énergie « verte ». C’est pourquoi, conscientes du rôle que peuvent jouer les énergies renouvelables, les autorités académiques ont créé le Centre d’Études et de Recherches sur les Énergies Renouvelables (CERER). Depuis sa création le CERER œuvre pour la diffusion d’une information réaliste, complète et pratique sur la couverture énergétique des zones rurales : électrification solaire, foyers améliorés…La réalisation de ce site Web contribuera à  ne  pas en douter, à une meilleure visibilité de notre centre, non seulement dans l’espace universitaire, mais aussi au sein de la communauté scientifique internationale et celle des acteurs du développement. Nous sommes convaincus que le développement des énergies renouvelables demeure la voie la plus attrayante pour résoudre nos problèmes énergétiques. Toutefois, cette pénétration des énergies renouvelables devra s’accompagner d’une lutte efficace contre le gaspillage d’énergie. C’est pour traduire en action concrète sur le terrain, cette volonté clairement affichée par les plus hautes autorités de l’Etat sénégalais que nous plaçons notre mission.

Stratégique, ce secteur est aussi l’un des plus grands émetteurs de CO2 et participe donc au dérèglement climatique. Pour concilier ce besoin en constante hausse et les enjeux environnementaux, il faut décarboner l’énergie, remplacer les énergies fossiles par des énergies bas-carbone, les faire fonctionner intelligemment ensemble, stocker à plus ou moins long terme les surplus et réduire la consommation totale en améliorant l’efficacité des technologies.

Le principe d’équivalence était né et il allait permettre, quelques années plus tard, de montrer que la gravitation n’est pas une véritable force, mais la manifestation physique de la courbure de l’espace-temps.

PMID: 29177956 DOI: 10.1007/978-981-10-5657-4_1 Abstract As the world's second-largest economy, China is going on suffering from environmental pollution, especially for ambient air pollution, which has become a major threat to public health; public awareness of the detrimental effects of air pollution on health is increasing-particularly in relation to haze days. Considering the nonlinear relationship of ambient air pollution exposure and health impacts, and the differences in specific sources of air pollution with those in North America and Europe, conducting health impact assessments of ambient air pollution in China has thus become an urgent task for public health practitioners. Systematic review of the health effects of exposure to ambient air pollution from quantitative studies conducted in Chinese could provide vital information for epidemiology-based health impact assessments and the implementation of a national environmental protection policy.

No longer enjoying a monopoly after the war, it lost trade to other ports such as Hong Kong and Shanghai, but continued to serve as a major transshipment port. Due to a high urban population and large volumes of port traffic, Guangzhou is classified as a Large-Port Megacity, the largest type of port-city in the world.[12] Guangzhou is at the heart of the most-populous built-up metropolitan area in mainland China, which extends into the neighboring cities of Foshan, Dongguan, Zhongshan, Shenzhen and part of Jiangmen, Huizhou, Zhuhai and Macao, forming the largest urban agglomeration on Earth with more than some 45 million inhabitants[13] and part of the Pearl River Delta Economic Zone. Administratively, the city holds subprovincial status[14] and is one of China's nine National Central Cities.[15] In the late 1990s and early 2000s, nationals of sub-Saharan Africa who had initially settled in the Middle East and Southeast Asia moved in unprecedented numbers to Guangzhou in response to the 1997/98 Asian financial crisis.[16] The domestic migrant population from other provinces of China in Guangzhou was 40% of the city's total population in 2008. Together with Shanghai, Beijing and Shenzhen, Guangzhou has one of the most expensive real estate markets in China.[17] At the end of 2018, the population of the city's expansive administrative area was estimated at 14,904,400 by city authorities, up 3.8% from the previous year.[18] In the so-called modern commerce, Guangzhou is best known for its annual Canton Fair, the oldest and largest trade fair in China. For three consecutive years (2013–2015), Forbes ranked Guangzhou as the best commercial city in mainland China.[19] Guangzhou is highly ranked as an Alpha- (global first-tier) city together with San Francisco and Stockholm. Guangzhou ranks 10th in the world and 5th in China (after Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Shenzhen) in terms of the number of billionaires according to the Hurun Global Rich List 2020.[20] The city is home to many of China's most prestigious universities,[21] including Sun Yat-sen University, South China University of Technology, South China Normal University and Jinan University. According to the Nature Index, Guangzhou has a high level of scientific research output, ranking 15th globally and fifth in China (after Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing and Wuhan).[22] Contents 1 Toponymy 2 History 2.1 Prehistory 2.2 Nanyue 2.3 Imperial China 2.4 Modern China 2.4.1 Revolutions 2.4.2 Republic of China 2.4.3 People's Republic of China 3 Gallery 4 Geography 4.1 Natural resources 4.2 Climate 4.3 Administrative divisions 5 Economy 5.1 Local products 5.2 Industry 6 Demographics 6.1 Ethnicity and language 6.2 Metropolitan area 7 Transportation 7.1 Urban mass transit 7.2 Motor transport 7.3 Airports 7.4 Railways 7.5 Water transport 8 Culture 8.1 Religions 8.1.1 Taoism 8.1.2 Buddhism 8.1.3 Christianity 8.1.4 Islam 9 Sport 10 Destinations 10.1 Eight Views 10.2 Parks and gardens 10.3 Tourist attractions 10.4 Pedestrian streets 10.5 Malls and shopping centers 10.6 Major buildings 11 Media 12 Education 13 International relations 13.1 Twin towns and sister cities 13.2 Consulates General/consulates 14 Honours 15 See also 16 Notes 17 References 17.1 Citations 17.2 Sources 18 Further reading 19 External links Toponymy[edit] A Qing-era portrait of the Grotto of the Five Immortals, the Taoist temple around the five stones which gave Guangzhou its nickname ""The City of Rams"". Guǎngzhōu is the official romanization of the Chinese name 廣州; 广州. The name of the city is taken from the ancient ""Guang Province"" after it had become the prefecture's seat of government, which is how some other Chinese cities, including Hangzhou, Suzhou, and Fuzhou got their names. The character 廣 or 广—which also appears in the names of the provinces Guangdong and Guangxi, together called the Liangguang—means ""broad"" or ""expansive"" and refers to the intention to dispense imperial grace broadly in the region with the founding of the county of Guangxin in the Han Dynasty. Before acquiring its current name, the town was known as Panyu (Punyü; 番禺), a name still borne by one of Guangzhou's districts not far from the main city. The origin of the name is still uncertain, with 11 various explanations being offered,[23] including that it may have referred to two local mountains.[24][25] The city has also sometimes been known as Guangzhou Fu or Guangfu after its status as the capital of a prefecture. From this latter name, Guangzhou was known to medieval Persians such as Al-Masudi and Ibn Khordadbeh[26] as Khanfu (خانفو).[27] Under the Southern Han, the city was renamed Xingwang Fu (興王府).[28][29] The Chinese abbreviation for Guangzhou is ""穗"" (although the abbreviation on car license plates, as with the rest of the province, is 粤), after its nickname ""City of Rice"" (穗城). The city has long borne the nickname City of Rams (羊城) or City of the Five Rams (五羊城) from the five stones at the old Temple of the Five Immortals said to have been the sheep or goats ridden by the Taoist culture heroes credited with introducing rice cultivation to the area around the time of the city's foundation.[30] The former name ""City of the Immortals"" (仙城/五仙城) came from the same story. The more recent City of Flowers (花城) is usually taken as a simple reference to the area's fine greenery. The English name ""Canton"" derived from Portuguese Cantão[31] or Cidade de Cantão,[32] a blend of dialectical pronunciations of ""Guangdong""[33][34] (e.g., Hakka Kóng-tûng). Although it originally and chiefly applied to the walled city, it was occasionally conflated with Guangdong by some authors.[note 1][note 2] It was adopted as the Postal Map Romanization of Guangzhou, and remained the official name until its name change to ""Guangzhou."" As an adjective, it is still used in describing the people, language, cuisine and culture of Guangzhou and the surrounding Liangguang region. The 19th-century name ""Kwang-chow foo""[36] derived from Nanjing dialect of Mandarin and the town's status as a prefectural capital. History[edit] Main article: Timeline of Guangzhou Prehistory[edit] A settlement now known as Nanwucheng was present in the area by 1000 BC.[37][38] Some traditional Chinese histories placed Nanwucheng's founding during the reign of Ji Yan,[39][40] king of Zhou from 314 to 256 BC. It was said to have consisted of little more than a stockade of bamboo and mud.[39][40] The jade burial suit of Zhao Mo in Guangzhou's Nanyue King Museum Nanyue[edit] Guangzhou, then known as Panyu, was founded on the eastern bank of the Pearl River[36] in 215 BC. It was the seat of Qin Empire's Nanhai Commandery, and served as a base for the first invasion of the Baiyue lands in southern China. Legendary accounts claimed that the soldiers at Panyu were so vigilant that they did not remove their armor for three years.[41] Upon the fall of the Qin, General Zhao Tuo established the kingdom of Nanyue and made Panyu its capital in 204 BC. It remained independent throughout the Chu-Han Contention, although Zhao negotiated recognition of his independence in exchange for his nominal submission to the Han in 196 BC.[42] Archeological evidence shows that Panyu was an expansive commercial center: in addition to items from central China, archeologists have found remains originating from Southeast Asia, India, and even Africa.[43] Zhao Tuo was succeeded by Zhao Mo and then Zhao Yingqi. Upon Zhao Yingqi's death in 115 BC, his younger son Zhao Xing was named as his successor in violation of Chinese primogeniture. By 113 BC, his Chinese mother, the Empress Dowager Jiu (樛) had prevailed upon him to submit Nanyue as a formal part of the Han Empire. The native prime minister Lü Jia (呂嘉) launched a coup, killing Han ambassadors along with the king, his mother, and their supporters.[44] A successful ambush then annihilated a Han force which had been sent to arrest him. Emperor Wu took offense and launched a massive river- and seaborne war: six armies under Lu Bode and Yang Pu[45] took Panyu and annexed Nanyue by the end of 111 BC.[44] Imperial China[edit] Guangzhou (as 廣) on the 1136 Map of the Tracks of Yu Lai Afong's photograph of a commercial street in Guangzhou c. 1880 Guangzhou (""Canton"") and the surrounding islands of Henan (""Hanan""), Pazhou (""Whampoa""), Changzhou (""Dane's Island""), and Xiaoguwei (""French Island"") during the First Opium War's Second Battle of Canton. The large East Indiamen of the Canton trade used the anchorage sheltered by these four islands, but the village and island of Huangpu for which it was named make up no part of present-day Guangzhou's Huangpu District. Incorporated into the Han Dynasty, Panyu became a provincial capital. In AD 226, it became the seat of Guang Prefecture, which gave it its modern name. The Old Book of Tang described Guangzhou as an important port in southern China.[46] Direct routes connected the Middle East and China, as shown in the records of a Chinese prisoner returning home from Iraq twelve years after his capture at Talas.[47] Relations were often strained: Arab and Persian pirates[48] sacked the city on October 30, 758[note 3][49][50][51][52] and came to an end under the revenge of Chinese rebel Huang Chao in 878, along with the city's Jews, Christians,[53][54][55] and Parsis.[56][57] The port was closed for fifty years after its destruction.[48] Amid the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms that followed the collapse of the Tang dynasty, the Later Liang governor Liu Yan used his base at Panyu to establish a ""Great Yue"" or ""Southern Han"" empire, which lasted from 917 to 971. The region enjoyed considerable cultural and economic success in this period. From the 10th to 12th century, there are records that the large foreign communities were not exclusively male, but included ""Persian women"".[58][59][note 4] According to Odoric of Pordenone, Guangzhou was as large as three Venices in terms of area, and rivaled all of Italy in the amount of crafts produced. He also noted the large amount of ginger available as well as large geese and snakes.[61] Guangzhou was visited by the Moroccan traveler Ibn Battuta during his 14th-century journey around the world;[62] he detailed the process by which the Chinese constructed their large ships in the port's shipyards.[63] Shortly after the Hongwu Emperor's declaration of the Ming dynasty, he reversed his earlier support of foreign trade and imposed the first of a series of sea bans (海禁).[64] These banned private foreign trade upon penalty of death for the merchant and exile for his family and neighbors.[65] The Yuan-era maritime intendancies of Guangzhou, Quanzhou, and Ningbo were closed in 1384[66] and legal trade became limited to the tribute delegations sent to or by official representatives of foreign governments.[67] Following the Portuguese conquest of the Melaka Sultanate, Rafael Perestrello traveled to Guangzhou as a passenger on a native junk in 1516.[68] His report induced Fernão Pires de Andrade to sail to the city with eight ships the next year,[68] but De Andrade's exploration[69] was understood as spying[70] and his brother Simão and others began attempting to monopolize trade,[71] enslaving Chinese women[72] and children,[note 5] engaging in piracy,[74] and fortifying the island of Tamão.[75][76] Rumors even circulated that Portuguese were eating the children.[77][73][note 6] The Guangzhou administration was charged with driving them off:[74] they bested the Portuguese at the Battle of Tunmen[79] and in Xicao Bay; held a diplomatic mission hostage in a failed attempt to pressure the restoration of the sultan of Malacca,[80] who had been accounted a Ming vassal;[81] and, after placing them in cangues and keeping them for most of a year, ultimately executed 23 by lingchi.[82][note 7] With the help of local pirates,[77] the ""Folangji"" then carried out smuggling at Macao, Lampacau, and St John's Island (now Shangchuan),[72] until Leonel de Sousa legalized their trade with bribes to Admiral Wang Bo (汪柏) and the 1554 Luso-Chinese Accord. The Portuguese undertook not to raise fortifications and to pay customs dues;[85] three years later, after providing the Chinese with assistance suppressing their former pirate allies,[86] the Portuguese were permitted to warehouse their goods at Macau instead of Guangzhou itself.[87] In October 1646, the Longwu Emperor's brother, Zhu Yuyue fled by sea to Guangzhou, the last stronghold of the Ming empire. On December 11, he declared himself the Shaowu Emperor, borrowing his imperial regalia from local theater troupes.[88] He led a successful offense against his cousin Zhu Youlang but was deposed and executed on 20 January 1647 when the Ming turncoat Li Chengdong (李成東) sacked the city on behalf of the Qing.[89][note 8] The Qing became somewhat more receptive to foreign trade after gaining control of Taiwan in 1683.[90] The Portuguese from Macau and Spaniards from Manila returned, as did private Muslim, Armenian, and English traders.[91] From 1699 to 1714, the French and British East India Companies sent a ship or two each year;[91] the Austrian Ostend General India Co. arrived in 1717,[92] the Dutch East India Co. in 1729,[93] the Danish Asiatic Co. in 1731,[note 9] and the Swedish East India Co. the next year.[91] These were joined by the occasional Prussian or Trieste Company vessel. The first independent American ship arrived in 1784, and the first colonial Australian one in 1788.[citation needed] By that time, Guangzhou was one of the world's great ports, organized under the Canton System.[95] The main exports were tea and porcelain.[91] As a meeting place of merchants from all over the world, Guangzhou became a major contributor to the rise of the modern global economy.[96] In the 19th century, most of the city's buildings were still only one or two stories. However, there were notable exceptions such as the Flower Pagoda of the Temple of the Six Banyan Trees, and the guard tower known as the Five-Story Pagoda. The subsequently urbanized northern hills were bare and covered with traditional graves. The brick city walls were about 6 miles (10 km) in circumference, 25 feet (8 m) high, and 20 feet (6 m) wide. Its eight main gates and two water gates all held guards during the day and were closed at night. The wall rose to incorporate a hill on its northern side and was surrounded on the other three by a moat which, along with the canals, functioned as the city's sewer, emptied daily by the river's tides. A partition wall with four gates divided the northern ""old town"" from the southern ""new town"" closer to the river; the suburb of Xiguan (Saikwan; ""West Gate"") stretched beyond and the boats of fishers, traders, and Tanka (""boat people"") almost entirely concealed the riverbank for about 4 miles (6 km). It was common for homes to have a storefront facing the street and to treat their courtyards as a kind of warehouse.[36] The city was part of a network of signal towers so effective that messages could be relayed to Beijing—about 1,200 miles (1,931 km) away—in less than 24 hours.[97] The Canton System was maintained until the outbreak of the First Opium War in 1839. Following a series of battles in the Pearl River Delta, the British captured Canton on March 18, 1841.[98] The Second Battle of Canton was fought two months later.[99] Following the Qing's 1842 treaty with Great Britain, Guangzhou lost its privileged trade status as more and more treaty ports were opened to more and more countries, usually including extraterritorial enclaves. Amid the decline of Qing prestige and the chaos of the Red Turban Rebellion (1854–1856), the Punti and Hakka waged a series of clan wars from 1855 to 1867 in which one million people died. The foreign trade facilities were destroyed by local Chinese in the Arrow War (1856–1858). The international community relocated to the outskirts and most international trade moved through Shanghai.[100][101] The concession for the Canton–Hankow railway was awarded to the American China Development Co. in 1898. It completed its branch line west to Foshan and Sanshui before being engulfed in a diplomatic crisis after a Belgian consortium bought a controlling interest and the Qing subsequently canceled its concession. J.P. Morgan was awarded millions in damages[102] and the line to Wuchang was not completed until 1936[103] and the completion of a unified Beijing–Guangzhou Railway waited until the completion of Wuhan's Yangtze River Bridge in 1957. Modern China[edit] Revolutions[edit] Mausoleum of the 72 Martyrs During the late Qing Dynasty, Guangzhou was the site of revolutionary attempts such as the Uprisings of 1895 and 1911 that were the predecessors of the successful Xinhai Revolution, which overthrew the Qing Dynasty. The 72 revolutionaries whose bodies were found after the latter uprising are honored as the city's 72 Martyrs at the Huanghuagang (""Yellow Flower Mound"") Mausoleum. Republic of China[edit] After the assassination of Sung Chiao-jen and Yuan Shihkai's attempts to remove the Nationalist Party of China from power, the leader of Guangdong Hu Hanmin joined the 1913 Second Revolution against him[104] but was forced to flee to Japan with Sun Yat-sen after its failure. The city came under national spotlight again in 1917, when Prime Minister Duan Qirui's abrogation of the constitution triggered the Constitutional Protection Movement. Sun Yat-sen came to head the Guangzhou Military Government supported by the members of the dissolved parliament and the Southwestern warlords. The Guangzhou government fell apart as the warlords withdrew their support. Sun fled to Shanghai in November 1918 until the Guangdong warlord Chen Jiongming restored him in October 1920 during the Yuegui Wars.[105] On 16 June 1922, Sun was ousted in a coup and fled on the warship Yongfeng after Chen sided with the Zhili Clique's Beijing government. In the following months Sun mounted a counterattack into Guangdong by rallying supporters from Yunnan and Guangxi, and in January established a government in the city for the third time. Flag of Kuomintang From 1923 to 1926 Sun and the Kuomintang used the city as a base to prosecute a renewed revolution in China by conquering the warlords in the north. Although Sun was previously dependent on opportunistic warlords who hosted him in the city, with the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek, the KMT developed its own military power to serve its ambition. The Canton years saw the evolution of the KMT into a revolutionary movement with a strong military focus and ideological commitment, setting the tone of the KMT rule of China beyond 1927. In 1924, the KMT made the momentous decision to ally with the Communist Party and the USSR. With Soviet help, KMT reorganized itself along the Leninist line and adopted a pro-labor and pro-peasant stance. The Kuomintang-CCP cooperation was confirmed in the First Congress of the KMT and the communists were instructed to join the KMT. The allied government set up the Peasant Movement Training Institute in the city, of which Mao Zedong was a director for one term. Sun and his military commander Chiang used Soviet funds and weapons to build an armed force staffed by communist commissars, training its cadres in the Whampoa Military Academy.[105] In August, the fledgling army suppressed the Canton Merchants' Corps Uprising. The next year the anti-imperialist May Thirtieth Movement swept the country, and the KMT government called for strikes in Canton and Hong Kong. The tensions of the massive strikes and protests led to the Shakee Massacre. After the death of Sun Yat-sen in 1925 the mood was changing in the party toward the communists. In August the left-wing KMT leader Liao Zhongkai was assassinated and the right-wing leader Hu Hanmin, the suspected mastermind, was exiled to the Soviet Union, leaving the pro-communist Wang Jingwei in charge. Opposing communist encroachment, the right-wing Western Hills Group vowed to expel the communists from the KMT. The ""Canton Coup"" on 20 March 1926 saw Chiang solidify his control over the Nationalists and their army against Wang Jingwei, the party's left wing, its Communist allies, and its Soviet advisors.[106][107] By May, he had ended civilian control of the military[107] and begun his Northern Expedition against the warlords of the north. Its success led to the split of the KMT between Wuhan and Nanking and the purge of the communists in the April 12 Incident. Immediately afterwards Canton joined the purge under the auspice of Li Jishen, resulting in the arrest of communists and the suspension of left wing KMT apparatuses and labor groups. Later in 1927 when Zhang Fakui, a general supportive of the Wuhan faction seized Canton and installed Wang Jingwei's faction in the city, the communists saw an opening and launched the Guangzhou Uprising. Prominent communist military leaders Ye Ting and Ye Jianying led the failed defense of the city. Soon, control of the city reverted to Li Jishen. Li was deposed during a war between Chiang and the Kwangsi Clique. By 1929, Chen Jitang had established himself as the powerholder of Guangdong. In 1931 he threw his weight behind the anti-Chiang schism by hosting a separate Nationalist government in Guangzhou.[108] Opposing Chiang's alleged dictatorship, the separatists included KMT leaders like Wang Ching-wei, Sun Fo and others from diverse factions. The peace negotiations amid the armed standoff led to the 4th National Congress of Kuomintang being held separately by three factions in Nanjing, Shanghai and Canton. Resigning all his posts, Chiang pulled off a political compromise that reunited all factions. While the intraparty division was resolved, Chen kept his power until he was defeated by Chiang in 1936. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the ""Canton Operation"" subjected the city to Japanese occupation by the end of December 1938. People's Republic of China[edit] Amid the closing months of the Chinese Civil War, Guangzhou briefly served as the capital of the Republic of China after the taking of Nanjing by the PLA in April 1949. The People's Liberation Army entered the city on 14 October 1949. Amid a massive exodus to Hong Kong and Macau, the Nationalists blew up the Haizhu Bridge across the Pearl River in retreat. The Cultural Revolution had a large effect on the city with much of its temples, churches and other monuments destroyed during this chaotic period. The People's Republic of China initiated building projects including new housing on the banks of the Pearl River to adjust the city's boat people to life on land. Since the 1980s, the city's close proximity to Hong Kong and Shenzhen and its ties to overseas Chinese have made it one of the first beneficiaries of China's opening up under Deng Xiaoping. Beneficial tax reforms in the 1990s have also helped the city's industrialization and economic development. The municipality was expanded in the year 2000, with Huadu and Panyu joining the city as urban districts and Conghua and Zengcheng as more rural counties. The former districts of Dongshan and Fangcun were abolished in 2005, merged into Yuexiu and Liwan respectively. The city acquired Nansha and Luogang. The former was carved out of Panyu, the latter from parts of Baiyun, Tianhe, Zengcheng, and an exclave within Huangpu. The National People's Congress approved a development plan for the Pearl River Delta in January 2009; on March 19 the same year, the Guangzhou and Foshan municipal governments agreed to establish a framework to merge the two cities.[109] In 2014, Luogang merged into Huangpu and both Conghua and Zengcheng counties were upgraded to districts.

The Pearl is the 4th-largest river of China.[112] Intertidal ecosystems exist on the tidal flat lining the river estuary, however, many of the tidal flats have been reclaimed for agriculture.[113] Baiyun Mountain is now locally referred to as the city's ""lung"" (市肺).[11][114][why?] The elevation of the prefecture generally increases from southwest to northeast, with mountains forming the backbone of the city and the ocean comprising the front. Tiantang Peak (simplified Chinese: 天堂顶; traditional Chinese: 天堂頂, ""Heavenly Peak"") is the highest point of elevation at 1,210 meters (3,970 ft) above sea level. Places adjacent to Guangzhou Qingyuan Qingyuan Shaoguan Foshan Guangzhou Huizhou Foshan, Zhongshan Zhongshan, South China Sea Dongguan Natural resources[edit] There are 47 different types of minerals and also 820 ore fields in Guangzhou, including 18 large and medium-sized oil deposits. The major minerals are granite, cement limestone, ceramic clay, potassium, albite, salt mine, mirabilite, nepheline, syenite, fluorite, marble, mineral water, and geothermal mineral water. Since Guangzhou is located in the water-rich area of southern China, it has a wide water area with many rivers and water systems, accounting for 10% of the total land area. The rivers and streams improve the landscape and keep the ecological environment of the city stable.[115] Climate[edit] Despite being located just south of the Tropic of Cancer, Guangzhou has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cfa/Cwa) influenced by the East Asian monsoon. Summers are wet with high temperatures, high humidity, and a high heat index. Winters are mild and comparatively dry. Guangzhou has a lengthy monsoon season, spanning from April through September. Monthly averages range from 13.9 °C (57.0 °F) in January to 28.9 °C (84.0 °F) in July, while the annual mean is 22.6 °C (72.7 °F).[11] Autumn, from October to December, is very moderate, cool and windy, and is the best travel time.[116] The relative humidity is approximately 68 percent, whereas annual rainfall in the metropolitan area is over 1,700 mm (67 in).[11] With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 17 percent in March and April to 52 percent in November, the city receives 1,628 hours of bright sunshine annually, considerably less than nearby Shenzhen and Hong Kong. Extreme temperatures have ranged from 0 °C (32 °F) to 39.1 °C (102.4 °F).[117] The last recorded snowfall in the city was on 24 January 2016, 87 years after the second last recorded snowfall.[118] Climate data for Guangzhou (normals 1971–2000, extremes 1961–2000) Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °C (°F) 27.2(81.0) 28.6(83.5) 32.1(89.8) 32.4(90.3) 36.2(97.2) 36.6(97.9) 39.1(102.4) 38.0(100.4) 37.6(99.7) 34.8(94.6) 32.5(90.5) 29.6(85.3) 39.1(102.4) Average high °C (°F) 18.3(64.9) 18.5(65.3) 21.6(70.9) 25.7(78.3) 29.3(84.7) 31.5(88.7) 32.8(91.0) 32.7(90.9) 31.5(88.7) 28.8(83.8) 24.5(76.1) 20.6(69.1) 26.3(79.4) Daily mean °C (°F) 13.9(57.0) 15.2(59.4) 18.1(64.6) 22.4(72.3) 25.8(78.4) 27.8(82.0) 28.9(84.0) 28.8(83.8) 27.5(81.5) 24.7(76.5) 20.1(68.2) 15.5(59.9) 22.4(72.3) Average low °C (°F) 10.3(50.5) 11.7(53.1) 15.2(59.4) 19.5(67.1) 22.7(72.9) 24.8(76.6) 25.5(77.9) 25.4(77.7) 24.0(75.2) 20.8(69.4) 15.9(60.6) 11.5(52.7) 18.9(66.1) Record low °C (°F) 0.1(32.2) 1.3(34.3) 3.2(37.8) 7.7(45.9) 14.6(58.3) 18.8(65.8) 21.6(70.9) 20.9(69.6) 15.5(59.9) 9.5(49.1) 4.9(40.8) 0.0(32.0) 0.0(32.0) Average rainfall mm (inches) 40.9(1.61) 69.4(2.73) 84.7(3.33) 201.2(7.92) 283.7(11.17) 276.2(10.87) 232.5(9.15) 227.0(8.94) 166.2(6.54) 87.3(3.44) 35.4(1.39) 31.6(1.24) 1,736.1(68.33) Average rainy days (≥ 0.1 mm) 7.5 11.2 15.0 16.3 18.3 18.2 15.9 16.8 12.5 7.1 5.5 4.9 149.2 Average relative humidity (%) 72 78 82 84 84 84 82 82 78 72 66 66 78 Mean monthly sunshine hours 118.5 71.6 62.4 65.1 104.0 140.2 202.0 173.5 170.2 181.8 172.7 166.0 1,628 Percent possible sunshine 35 22 17 17 26 35 49 43 46 51 52 50 37 Source: China Meteorological Administration,[119] all-time extreme temperature[117] Administrative divisions[edit] Main article: List of administrative divisions of Guangzhou Guangzhou is a subprovincial city.

In 2017, the GDP reached ¥2,150 billion (US$318 billion), per capita was ¥150,678 (US$22,317).[124] Guangzhou is considered one of the most prosperous cities in China. Guangzhou ranks 10th in the world and 5th in China (after Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Shenzhen) in terms of the number of billionaires according to the Hurun Global Rich List 2020.[20] Guangzhou is projected to be among the world top 10 largest cities in terms of nominal GDP in 2035 (together with Shanghai, Beijing and Shenzhen in China) according to a study by Oxford Economics,[125] and its nominal GDP per capita will reach above US$42,000 in 2030.[126] Guangzhou also ranks 21st globally (between Washington, D.C. and Amsterdam) and 8th in the whole Asia and the Pacific (behind Shanghai, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Singapore, Beijing, Shenzhen and Dubai) in the 2020 Global Financial Centers Index (GFCI).[127] Owing to rapid industrialization, it was once also considered a rather polluted city. After green urban planning was implemented, it is now one of the most livable cities in China. The Canton Fair, formally the ""China Import and Export Fair"", is held every year in April and October by the Ministry of Trade. Inaugurated in the spring of 1957, the fair is a major event for the city. It is the trade fair with the longest history, highest level, and largest scale in China.[128] From the 104th session onwards, the fair moved to the new Guangzhou International Convention and Exhibition Center (广州国际会展中心) in Pazhou, from the older complex in Liuhua. The GICEC is served by two stations on Line 8 and three stations on Tram Line THZ1. Since the 104th session, the Canton Fair has been arranged in three phases instead of two phases.

(June 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Cantonese is one of China's most famous and popular regional cuisines, with a saying stating simply to ""Eat in Guangzhou"" (食在廣州)[note 10] Cantonese sculpture includes work in jade, wood, and (now controversially) ivory. Canton porcelain developed over the past three centuries as one of the major forms of exportware. It is now known within China for its highly colorful style. Cantonese embroidery is one of China's four main styles of the embroidery, and is represented in Guangzhou, although the industry is mainly centered in Chaozhou. Zhujiang Beer, a pale lager, is one of China's most successful brands. It is made in Guangzhou from water piped directly to the brewery from a natural spring. Industry[edit] Guangzhou Peugeot Automobile Company produced the Peugeot 504 and Peugeot 505 automobiles from 1989 to 1997. Guangzhou Economic and Technological Development Zone Guangzhou Nansha Export Processing Zone The Export Processing Zone was founded in 2005. Its total planned area is 1.36 km2 (0.53 sq mi).[129] It is located in Nansha District and it belongs to the provincial capital, Guangzhou. The major industries encouraged in the zone include automobile assembly, biotechnology and heavy industry. It is situated 54 kilometers (34 miles) (a 70 minutes drive) south of Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport and close to Nansha Port. It also has the advantage of Guangzhou Metro line 4 which is being extended to Nansha Ferry Terminal. Guangzhou Free Trade Zone The zone was founded in 1992. It is located in the east of Huangpu District and near to Guangzhou Economic and Technological Development Zone. It is also very close to Guangzhou Baiyun Airport.[130] The major industries encouraged in the zone include international trade, logistics, processing and computer software. Recently the Area has been rebranded and is now being marketed under the name Huangpu District. Next to the industries above, new sectors are being introduced to the business environment, including new energy, AI, new mobility, new materials, information and communication technology and new transport. It is also Home to the Guangzhou IP Court.[131] Guangzhou Science City Demographics[edit] Historical populationYearPop.±%1950[132]2,567,645—    1960[132]3,683,104+43.4%1970[132]4,185,363+13.6%1980[132]5,018,638+19.9%1990[132]5,942,534+18.4%2000[132]9,943,000+67.3%2002[133]10,106,229+1.6%2005[134]9,496,800−6.0%2006[134]9,966,600+4.9%2007[134]10,530,100+5.7%2008[134]11,153,400+5.9%2009[134]11,869,700+6.4%2010[132]12,701,948+7.0%2011[135]12,751,400+0.4%2012[135]12,832,900+0.6%2013[135]12,926,800+0.7%2014[135]13,080,500+1.2%201814,904,400+13.9%Population size may be affected by changes to administrative divisions. The 2010 census found Guangzhou's population to be 12.78 million. As of 2014[update], it was estimated at 13,080,500,[2][135] with 11,264,800 urban residents.[3] Its population density is thus around 1,800 people per km2. The built-up area of the Guangzhou proper connects directly to several other cities. The built-up area of the Pearl River Delta Economic Zone covers around 17,573 square kilometers (6,785 sq mi) and has been estimated to house 22 million people, including Guangzhou's nine urban districts, Shenzhen (5.36m), Dongguan (3.22m), Zhongshan (3.12m), most of Foshan (2.2m), Jiangmen (1.82m), Zhuhai (890k), and Huizhou's Huiyang District (760k).[citation needed] The total population of this agglomeration is over 28 million after including the population of the adjacent Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.[citation needed] The area's fast-growing economy and high demand for labor has produced a huge ""floating population"" of migrant workers; thus, up to 10 million migrants reside in the area least six months each year.[citation needed] In 2008, about five million of Guangzhou's permanent residents were hukouless migrants.[136] Ethnicity and language[edit] Most of Guangzhou's population is Han Chinese. Almost all Cantonese people speak Cantonese as their first language,[138] while most migrants speak forms of Mandarin.[136] In 2010, each language was the native tongue of roughly half of the city's population,[139] although minor but substantial numbers speak other varieties as well.[citation needed] In 2018, He Huifeng of the South China Morning Post stated that younger residents have increasingly favored using Mandarin instead of Cantonese in their daily lives, causing their Cantonese-speaking grandparents and parents to use Mandarin to communicate with them. He Huifeng stated that factors included local authorities discouraging the use of Cantonese in schools and the rise in prestige of Mandarin-speaking Shenzhen.[140] Jinan University released a survey result of the Guangzhou youths born in the year 2000 or after that were part of this educational study showed that 69% could still speak and understand Cantonese, 20% can understand Cantonese, but unable to speak it, and 11% completely had no knowledge of Cantonese. Jinan University's study of these Guangzhou youths also indicated when it came to the daily recreational use of Cantonese, roughly 40%-50% of them participated in these recreational functions with the usage of Cantonese with 51.4% of them in mobile games, 47% in Social Platforms, 44.1% in TV shows, and 39.8% in Books and Newspapers. Despite some decline in the use of Cantonese, it is faring better in survival, popularity, and prestige than other Chinese dialects due to the historical pride in the language and culture, as well as the wide popularity and availability of mainstream Cantonese entertainment, which encourages locals to retain the Cantonese language.[141][142] Guangzhou has an even more unbalanced gender ratio than the rest of the country. While most areas of China have 112–120 boys per 100 girls, the Guangdong province that houses Guangzhou has more than 130 boys for every 100 girls.[143] Recent years have seen a huge influx of migrants, with up to 30 million additional migrants living in the Guangzhou area for at least six months out of every year with the majority being female migrants and many becoming local Guangzhou people. This huge influx of people from other areas, called the floating population, is due to the city's fast-growing economy and high labor demands. Guangzhou Mayor Wan Qingliang told an urban planning seminar that Guangzhou is facing a very serious population problem stating that, while the city had 10.33 million registered residents at the time with targets and scales of land use based on this number, the city actually had a population with migrants of nearly 15 million. According to the Guangzhou Academy of Social Sciences researcher Peng Peng, the city is almost at its maximum capacity of just 15 million, which means the city is facing a great strain, mostly due to a high population of unregistered people.[143] According to the 2000 National Census, marriage is one of the top two reasons for permanent migration and particular important for women as 29.3% of the permanent female migrants migrate for marriage [Liang et al.,2004]. Many of the female economic migrants marry men from Guangzhou in hopes of a better life.[144] but like elsewhere in the People's Republic of China, the household registration system (hukou) limits migrants' access to residences, educational institutions and other public benefits. It has been noted that many women end up in prostitution.[145] In May 2014, legally employed migrants in Guangzhou were permitted to receive a hukou card allowing them to marry and obtain permission for their pregnancies in the city, rather than having to return to their official hometowns as previously.[146] Historically, the Cantonese people have made up a sizable part of the 19th- and 20th-century Chinese diaspora; in fact, many overseas Chinese have ties to Guangzhou. This is particularly true in the United States,[147] Canada,[148] and Australia. Demographically, the only significant immigration into China has been by overseas Chinese, but Guangzhou sees many foreign tourists, workers, and residents from the usual locations such as the United States. Notably, it is also home to thousands of African immigrants, including people from Nigeria, Somalia, Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo.[149] Metropolitan area[edit] The encompassing metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) to have, as of 2010[update], a population of 25 million.[150][151] Transportation[edit] The east square of Guangzhou railway station in 1991. Urban mass transit[edit] Main article: Guangzhou Metro When the first line of the Guangzhou Metro opened in 1997, Guangzhou was the fourth city in Mainland China to have an underground railway system, behind Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai. Currently the metro network is made up of thirteen lines, covering a total length of 476.26 km (295.93 mi).[152] A long-term plan is to make the city's metro system expand to over 500 km (310 mi) by 2020 with 15 lines in operation. In addition to the metro system there is also the Haizhu Tram line which opened on 31 December 2014.[153] The Guangzhou Bus Rapid Transit (GBRT) system which was introduced in 2010 along Zhongshan Road. It has several connections to the metro and is the world's 2nd-largest bus rapid transit system with 1,000,000 passenger trips daily.[154] It handles 26,900 pphpd during the peak hour a capacity second only to the TransMilenio BRT system in Bogota.[155] The system averages one bus every 10 seconds or 350 per hour in a single direction and contains the world's longest BRT stations—around 260 m (850 ft) including bridges. Motor transport[edit] See also: List of bus routes in Guangzhou In the 19th century, the city already had over 600 long, straight streets; these were mostly paved but still very narrow.[36] In June 1919, work began on demolishing the city wall to make way for wider streets and the development of tramways. The demolition took three years in total.[156] In 2009, it was reported that all 9,424 buses and 17,695 taxis in Guangzhou would be operating on LPG-fuel by 2010 to promote clean energy for transport and improve the environment ahead of the 2010 Asian Games which were held in the city.[157] At present[when?], Guangzhou is the city that uses the most LPG-fueled vehicles in the world, and at the end of 2006, 6,500 buses and 16,000 taxis were using LPG, taking up 85 percent of all buses and taxis.[citation needed] Effective January 1, 2007, the municipal government banned motorcycles in Guangdong's urban areas. Motorcycles found violating the ban are confiscated.[158] The Guangzhou traffic bureau claimed to have reported reduced traffic problems and accidents in the downtown area since the ban.[159] Airports[edit] Guangzhou's main airport is the Baiyun International Airport in Baiyun District; it opened on August 5, 2004.[160] This airport is the second busiest airport in terms of traffic movements in China. It replaced the old Baiyun International Airport, which was very close to the city center but failed to meet the city's rapidly growing air traffic demand. The old Baiyun International Airport was in operation for 72 years. Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport now has three runways, with two more planned.[161] The Terminal 2 has opened on April 26, 2018.[162] Another airport located in Zengcheng District is under planning.[163] Guangzhou is served by Hong Kong International Airport; ticketed passengers can take ferries from the Lianhuashan Ferry Terminal and Nansha Ferry Port in Nansha District to the HKIA Skypier.[164] There are also coach bus services connecting Guangzhou with HKIA.[165] Railways[edit] Further information: Guangzhou railway station, Guangzhou East railway station, Guangzhou South railway station, and Guangzhou North railway station Guangzhou is the terminus of the Beijing–Guangzhou, Guangzhou–Shenzhen, Guangzhou–Maoming and Guangzhou–Meizhou–Shantou conventional speed railways. In late 2009, the Wuhan–Guangzhou high-speed railway started service, with multiple unit trains covering 980 km (608.94 mi) at a top speed of 320 km/h (199 mph). In December 2014, the Guiyang–Guangzhou high-speed railway and Nanning-Guangzhou railway began service with trains running at top speeds of 250 km/h (155 mph) and 200 km/h (124 mph), respectively.[166] The Guangdong Through Train departs from the Guangzhou East railway station and arrives at the Hung Hom station in Kowloon, Hong Kong. The route is approximately 182 km (113 mi) in length and the ride takes less than two hours. Frequent coach services are also provided with coaches departing every day from different locations (mostly major hotels) around the city. A number of regional railways radiating from Guangzhou started operating such as the Guangzhou–Zhuhai intercity railway and the Guangzhou-Foshan-Zhaoqing intercity railway. Water transport[edit] There are daily high-speed catamaran services between Nansha Ferry Terminal and Lianhua Shan Ferry Terminal in Guangzhou and the Hong Kong China Ferry Terminal, as well as between Nansha Ferry Terminal and Macau Ferry Pier in Hong Kong. Gongyuanqian Station of the Guangzhou Metro Tianhe Sports Center Station (GBRT) Baiyun International Airport in Huadu District A CRH3 Train at Guangzhou South Railway Station A Tram at Wanshengwei Station Culture[edit] Guangzhou Opera House Within China, the culture of the Cantonese people is a subset of the larger ""Southern"" or ""Lingnan"" cultural areas. Notable aspects of Guangzhou's cultural heritage include: Cantonese language, the local and prestige variant of Yue Chinese Cantonese cuisine, one of China's eight major culinary traditions[167][note 11] Cantonese opera, usually divided into martial and literary performances Xiguan (Saikwan), the area west of the former walled city The Guangzhou Opera House & Symphony Orchestra also perform classical Western music and Chinese compositions in their style. Cantonese music is a traditional style of Chinese instrumental music, while Cantopop is the local form of pop music and rock-and-roll which developed from neighboring Hong Kong. Religions[edit] Qing-era Guangzhou had around 124 religious pavilions, halls, and temples.[36] Today, in addition to the Buddhist Association, Guangzhou also has a Taoist Association, a Jewish community,[169][170] as well as a history with Christianity, reintroduced to China by colonial powers.[clarification needed] Taoism[edit] Taoism and Chinese folk religion are still represented at a few of the city's temples. Among the most important is the Temple of the Five Immortals, honoring the five immortals credited with introducing rice cultivation at the foundation of the city. The five rams they rode were supposed to have turned into stones upon their departure and gave the city several of its nicknames.[171] Another place of worship is the City God Temple. Guangzhou, like most of southern China, is also notably observant concerning ancestral veneration during occasions like the Tomb Sweeping and Ghost Festivals. Buddhism[edit] Buddhism is the most prominent religion in Guangzhou.[172] The Zhizhi Temple was founded in AD 233 from the estate of a Wu official; it is said to comprise the residence of Zhao Jiande, the last of the Nanyue kings, and has been known as the Guangxiao Temple (""Temple of Bright Filial Piety"") since the Ming. The missionary Bodhidharma is traditionally said to have visited Panyu during the Liu Song or Liang dynasties (5th or 6th century). Around AD 520, Emperor Wu of the Liang ordered the construction of the Baozhuangyan Temple and the Xilai Monastery to store the relics of Cambodian Buddhist saints which had been brought to the city and to house the monks beginning to assemble there. The Baozhuangyan is now known as the Temple of the Six Banyan Trees, after a famous poem composed by Su Shi after a visit during the Northern Song.[citation needed] The Xilai Monastery was renamed the Hualin Temple (""Flowery Forest Temple"") after its reconstruction during the Qing. The temples were damaged by both the Republican campaign to ""Promote Education with Temple Property"" (廟產興學) and the Maoist Cultural Revolution but have been renovated since the opening up that began in the 1980s. The Ocean Banner Temple on Henan Island, once famous in the west as the only tourist spot in Guangzhou accessible to foreigners, has been reopened as the Hoi Tong Monastery. Christianity[edit] Nestorian Christians first arrived in China via the overland Silk Road, but suffered during Emperor Wuzong's 845 persecution and were essentially extinct by the year 1000.[173][specify] The Qing-era ban on foreigners limited missionaries until it was abolished following the First Opium War, although the Protestant Robert Morrison was able to perform some work through his service with the British factory. The Catholic Archdiocese of Guangzhou is housed at Guangzhou's Sacred Heart Cathedral, known locally as the ""Stone House"". A Gothic Revival edifice which was built by hand from 1861 to 1888 under French direction, its original Latin and French stained-glass windows were destroyed during the wars and amid the Cultural Revolution; they have since been replaced by English ones. The Canton Christian College (1888) and Hackett Medical College for Women (1902) were both founded by missionaries and now form part of Guangzhou's Lingnan. Since the opening up of China in the 1980s, there has been renewed interest in Christianity, but Guangzhou maintains pressure on underground churches which avoid registration with government officials.[174] The Catholic archbishop Dominic Tang was imprisoned without trial for 22 years; however, his present successor is recognized by both the Vatican and China's Patriotic Church. Islam[edit] Guangzhou has had ties with the Islamic world since the Tang Dynasty.[175] Relations were often strained: Arab and Persian pirates sacked the city on October 30, 758; the port was subsequently closed for fifty years.[48][49][50][51][52] Their presence came to an end under the revenge of Chinese rebel Huang Chao in 878, along with that of the Jews, Christians,[53][54][55] and Parsis.[56][57] Nowadays, the city is home to halal restaurants.[176] Guangzhou's Temple of the Five Immortals The Hall of the 500 Arhats at the Flowery Forest Temple (Hualin) in the 1870s The Temple of Bright Filial Piety Guangzhou's City God Temple The sacred pigs of the Ocean Banner Temple (Hoi Tong) in the 1830s The Flower Pagoda at the Temple of the Six Banyan Trees (Liurong) The Thousand Buddha Tower at the present-day Hoi Tong Monastery Sacred Heart Cathedral Tianhe Church, built in 2017 Sport[edit] Guangdong Olympic Stadium Tianhe Stadium is the home of Guangzhou F.C. Yuexiushan Stadium is the home of Guangzhou City F.C.

Together they broadcast in more than a dozen channels. The primary language of both stations is Cantonese. Traditionally only one channel of Radio Guangdong is dedicated to Mandarin Chinese. However, in recent years there has been an increase in Mandarin programs on most Cantonese channels. Radio stations from cities around Guangzhou mainly broadcast in Cantonese and can be received in different parts of the city, depending on the radio stations' locations and transmission power. The Beijing-based China National Radio also broadcasts Mandarin programs in the city. Radio Guangdong has a 30-minute weekly English programs, Guangdong Today, which is broadcast globally through the World Radio Network. Daily English news programs are also broadcast by Radio Guangdong. Guangzhou has some of the most notable Chinese-language newspapers and magazines in mainland China, most of which are published by three major newspaper groups in the city, the Guangzhou Daily Press Group, Nanfang Press Corporation, and the Yangcheng Evening News Group. The two leading newspapers of the city are Guangzhou Daily and Southern Metropolis Daily. The former, with a circulation of 1.8 million, has been China's most successful newspaper for 14 years in terms of advertising revenue, while Southern Metropolis Daily is considered one of the most liberal newspapers in mainland China. In addition to Guangzhou's Chinese-language publications, there are a few English magazines and newspapers. The most successful is That's Guangzhou, which started more than a decade ago and has since blossomed into That's PRD, producing expatriate magazines in Beijing and Shanghai as well. It also produces In the Red.

Hamilton (1727) used Canton to refer to both the city and the province, but used Canton for the city more frequently in the same work, especially when he wrote Canton without reference to “Quantung”. See A. Hamilton (1727; pp. 224–238)[35] ^ Given in contemporary sources as the ""Guisi Day"" (癸巳) of the 9th lunar month of the first year of the Qianyuan Era under Emperor Suzong of the Tang. ^ The term ""Persian"" may, however, have been loosely applied and referred indifferently to any similar-looking foreign women.[60] ^ ""Buying and selling of children was scarcely unknown in Ming China, but the large new demands of the Portuguese may have stimulated kidnapings from good families...""[73] ^ ""Some early Chinese historians go even so far as to give vivid details of the price paid for the children and how they were roasted.""[78] ^ ""On the day of St Nicholas [6 Dec.] in the year 1522 they put boards on them with the sentence that they should die and be exposed in pillories as robbers. The sentences said: 'Petty sea robbers sent by the great robber falsely; they come to spy out our country; let them die in pillories as robbers.' A report was sent to the king according to the information of the mandarins, and the king confirmed the sentence. On 23 Sept. 1523 these twenty-three persons were each one cut in pieces, to wit, heads, legs, arms, and their private members placed in their mouths, the trunk of the body being divided into two pieces round the belly. In the streets of Canton, outside the walls, in the suburbs, through the principal streets they were put to death, at distances of one crossbow shot from one another, that all might see them, both those of Canton and those of the environs, in order to give them to understand that they thought nothing of the Portuguese, so that the people might not talk of the Portuguese. Thus... they were all killed, and their heads and private members were carried on the backs of the Portuguese in front of the mandarins of Canton with the playing of musical instruments and rejoicing, were exhibited suspended in the streets, and were then thrown into the dunghills. And from henceforth it was resolved not to allow any more Portuguese into the country nor other strangers.""[84] ^ The Shaowu Emperor's remains are buried in Yuexiu Park. ^ In fact, the Danish Asiatic Company was formally chartered in April 1732 while this first ship, the Cron-Printz Christian, was on its return trip.[94] Counting the Cron-Printz Christian, up to 1833, the DAC dispatched 130 ships to Guangzhou, losing five. The average voyage from Copenhagen took 216 days and the voyage back, 192.[91] ^ The statement is an excerpt from the longer proverb ""Be born in Suzhou, play in Hangzhou, eat in Guangzhou, and die in Liuzhou"" (生在蘇州，玩在杭州，食在廣州，死在柳州). ^ The other seven are the cuisines of Anhui, Fujian, Hunan, Jiangsu, Shandong, Sichuan and Zhejiang.[168] References[edit] Citations[edit] ^ 土地面积、人口密度（2008年）.

The strength of the Coalition is based on its worldwide membership and on the fact that it brings together a range of civil society groups. Dedicated to advocacy, empowerment of the poor and the discriminated, solidarity networking, popular mobilization, debate, training and analysis, HIC works to unite civil society in a shared commitment to ensure sustainable habitat and a livable planet for all. Its work focuses on defending and implementing the human rights linked to housing and habitat; i.e., land, housing, clean water, sanitation, a healthy environment, access to public goods and services; e.g., health, education, transport and recreation; access to livelihood and social protection, pluralism and the preservation of social, natural, historic and cultural patrimony.Since the ’80 HIC has been developing special capacities seeking gender equality, in a balanced articulation between reflection and action on different issues: the rights’ approach, the right to the city, the social production of habitat, women and habitat and the sustainable habitat.HIC specific work on the right to the city seeks to deepen the analysis and the actions on the proposal of building more just cities worldwide. HIC has been committed since decades in the creation of a theoretical and practical framework for the right to the city. The Coalition articulates and accompanies social movements and organizations in their struggle to achieve the realization of all human rights to ensure the collective well-being of inhabitants; the democratic management and the social function of the city. HIC is also aware of the global challenges facing worldwide on climate change and food sovereignty and the obvious impacts on the cities: the Coalition works on broaden exchanges between urban and rural movements.In order to strengthen HIC support to social struggles for housing and land rights, there is a need to analyze the nature of civil society in urban and rural areas, understanding their strengths, weaknesses and opportunities.HIC seeks to envision alternative ways, evolving bottom-up perspectives on governance and decision-making, empowering livelihoods, assets and shared knowledge, access to technology. HIC supports and nurtures grassroots movements in their self management initiatives to improve their life struggling for collective rights.The Coalition articulates and supports people’s processes through specific instruments and actions for both governments, civil society organizations and others international networks, like the Urgent Action Appeals and the HICademy, as well as outputs to realize the human right to adequate housing and equitable land. 3 case studies | 4 Analyses/working papers/articles 3 case studies De la protesta a la propuesta y de la propuesta al proyecto Villa Esfuerzo, Santo Domingo, República Dominicana Steffen Lajoie, 2010 HIC Do protesto à proposta e da proposta ao projeto, Villa Esfuerzo, Santo Domingo, República Dominicana Steffen Lajoie, 2010 HIC From Protest, to Proposal, to Project in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic Steffen Lajoie, 2010 HIC 4 Analyses/working papers/articles Derecho a la vivienda y la ciudad en la nueva Constitución de Ecuador Pablo GUTIÉRREZ, September 2009 HIC O contrato social pela moradia - CSV, Equador Silvana Ruiz Pozo, 2009 HIC The Social Contract for Housing, Ecuador Silvana Ruiz Pozo, 2009 HIC El contrato social por la vivienda – CSV en Ecuador Silvana Ruiz Pozo, 2009 HIC Website: www.hic-net.org/ Themes: An alternative vision of the economy Redefining wealth Toward ecological transition Social justice, peace and human rights Finance and money at the service of society Alternative forms of entrepreneurship, production and consumption Public policies and the solidarity economy Redefining the economy on a territorial basis SSE education, information and training Other filters: By author By organisation Geographical access By keyword By conferences By reading lists/syllabi Our partners Contact How to contribute socioeco.org is part of Ripess Europe and Ripess International socioeco.org is part of theCoredem",Habitat International Coalition

The Coalition comprises social movements, community-based organizations, support groups and academics. The strength of the Coalition is based on its worldwide membership (it has members in 117 nations in five continents) and on the fact that it brings together a range of civil society groups. Dedicated to advocacy and support for the poor, solidarity networking, popular mobilization, debate and analysis, HIC works to unite civil society in a shared commitment to ensuring sustainable habitat and a livable planet for all. Its work focuses on defending and implementing the human rights linked to housing and habitat; i.e., land, housing, clean water, sanitation, a healthy environment, access to public goods and services (e.g., health, education, transport and recreation; access to livelihood and social protection, pluralism and the preservation of social, natural, historic and cultural patrimony. Since the ’80 HIC has been developing special capacities seeking gender equality, in a balanced articulation between reflection and action on different issues: the rights’ approach, the right to the city, the social production of habitat, women and habitat and the sustainable habitat. HIC specific work on the right to the city seeks to deepen the analysis and the actions on the proposal of building more just cities worldwide. HIC has been committed since decades in the creation of a theoretical and practical framework for the right to the city. The Coalition articulates and accompanies social movements and organizations in their struggle to achieve the realization of all human rights to ensure the collective well-being of inhabitants; the democratic management and the social function of the city. HIC is also aware of the global challenges facing worldwide on climate change and food sovereignty and the obvious impacts on the cities: the Coalition works on broaden exchanges between urban and rural movements. HIC’S work on social production of habitat seeks to derive practical lessons from the compilation, exchange and analysis of “people’s processes” in initiating, designing, building and maintaining local environments. These experiences, which build upon local social resources and demonstrate local social reliance and ingenuity, generate and promote methods and strategies that then can be shared and replicated across regions. Each region has given rise to diverse and specific examples of struggles and efforts that emphasize distinct circumstances and priorities to construct people-centred livelihoods. In order to strengthen people's process for access and provision of land and shelter, lessons learned to date show a need to: understand what sustains the people’s process on land, housing and habitat/settlements development, in urban and rural areas, understand what are the forces, both external and internal, that strengthen or weaken peoples’ processes, including political and economic forces that have a bearing on people's processes, and in particular the dynamics of the informal and formal land markets; envision alternative ways to develop cities and other human settlements, evolving a bottom-up perspective on human settlement development without destroying livelihoods, assets and material achievements of the poor, while, quite to the contrary, supporting and nurturing livelihoods, assets and settlements of the poor, and their integration into the city; articulate and support the people’s processes through policies and actions for both government and nongovernmental organizations; develop more flexible design-based, knowledge-based and service-based housing policies and outputs with the objective of realizing the human right to adequate housing and equitable land use. Contents 1 History 2 Members 3 See also 4 External links History[edit] The beginnings of the Habitat International Coalition refer to the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements in Vancouver in 1976. In this conference a committee was created and was further elaborated in the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm in 1972 and other global UN conferences. In 1976 the committee concluded and supported the necessity for there to be a constant NGO pressure on governments and international agencies to follow up their recommendations. Also in 1976, the UN Centre for Human Settlements (UN Habitat) was created and therefore the committee sought to create an organization that represented the NGO interests in this sphere named Habitat International Council. Initially HIC was made up of primarily of organizations from the North. In 1985 it was able to widen its membership to include global representation through a project that sought to document innovative ways to work with low-income groups and community organizations to improve housing conditions and the different ways that they pressured governments to resolve housing needs. As part of the preparations for the UN International Year of Shelter for the Homeless in 1987, HIC members organized a conference in Limuru, Kenya that brought together representatives from over 40 NGOs from Africa, Asia and Latin America as well as many international NGOs. The discussions that took place therein gave way to a new HIC structure, culminating in a clear vision to fight for everyone's right to a secure place to live in peace and dignity.

Get more HMS news here “It is incumbent on medical and health care institutions to take a critical look at our role in perpetuating, and now purging, structural racism in service to our mission of caring for the health and well-being of every patient,” said Harvard Medical School Dean George Q. Daley, emphasizing the significance of the collaboration. “It is critical that we work together across institutions and commit to intentionality in our individual and collective self-examinations, as well as in our actions toward sustained change,” said Joan Reede, HMS dean for diversity and community partnership.

The principles adopted include a commitment to acknowledging and learning about the history of racism in medicine and the role of privilege, as well as recognizing explicit and implicit biases. The principles also contain a promise to lead and commit, with leaders actively working to identify and dismantle racism. A third principle outlines a plan to transform and cultivate, with a pledge to confront and disrupt existing practices and policies that exclude and devalue trainees, physicians, faculty, staff, and patients of color, among other issues. “With this set of principles, we are committing to create and sustain a culture across medicine in Massachusetts that is equitable as we seek to dismantle racism in all of its forms, starting with our medical students’ education, for years to come,” Bharel said. ""It is mission critical for the medical society, the DPH, and our state’s medical schools to lead in supporting the next generation of physicians and their patients,"" said MMS President Carole Allen. “This document outlines important steps to address systemic racism as it manifests in health care.” “In order to break down the structures of structural racism, we must learn, we must teach, we must lead. I am so proud of the Massachusetts health care community for coming together in this time of crisis,” said David Rosman, the medical society’s immediate past president.

220,"Urban area - Wikipedia Urban area From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Human settlement with high population density and infrastructure of built environment ""Built up area"" redirects here. For the Highway Code, see Built-up area (Highway Code). ""Urban agglomeration"" redirects here. For city clusters, see Megalopolis. Greater Tokyo Area, Japan, the world's most populated urban area, with about 38 million inhabitants Greater Melbourne at night, seen from the International Space Station An urban area, or built-up area, is a human settlement with a high population density and infrastructure of built environment. Urban areas are created through urbanization and are categorized by urban morphology as cities, towns, conurbations or suburbs. In urbanism, the term contrasts to rural areas such as villages and hamlets; in urban sociology or urban anthropology it contrasts with natural environment. The creation of early predecessors of urban areas during the urban revolution led to the creation of human civilization with modern urban planning, which along with other human activities such as exploitation of natural resources led to a human impact on the environment. ""Agglomeration effects"" are in the list of the main consequences of increased rates of firm creation since. This is due to conditions created by a greater level of industrial activity in a given region. However, a favorable environment for human capital development would also be generated simultaneously.[1] The world's urban population in 1950 of just 746 million has increased to 3.9 billion in the decades since.[2] In 2009, the number of people living in urban areas (3.42 billion) surpassed the number living in rural areas (3.41 billion), and since then the world has become more urban than rural.[3] This was the first time that the majority of the world's population lived in a city.[4] In 2014 there were 7.2 billion people living on the planet,[5] of which the global urban population comprised 3.9 billion. The Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs at that time predicted the urban population would grow to 6.4 billion by 2050, with 37% of that growth to come from three countries: China, India and Nigeria.[2] The UN publishes data on cities,urban areas and rural areas, but relies almost entirely on national definitions of these areas. The UN principles and recommendations state that due to different characteristics of urban and rural areas across the globe, a global definition is not possible.[6] Urban areas are created and further developed by the process of urbanization. Urban areas are measured for various purposes, including analyzing population density and urban sprawl. Unlike an urban area, a metropolitan area includes not only the urban area, but also satellite cities plus intervening rural land that is socio-economically connected to the urban core city, typically by employment ties through commuting, with the urban core city being the primary labor market. The concept of an ""urban area"" as used in economic statistics should not be confused with the concept of the ""urban area"" used in road safety statistics. The last concept is also known as ""built-up area in road safety"". According to the definition by the Office for National Statistics, ""Built-up areas are defined as land which is 'irreversibly urban in character', meaning that they are characteristic of a town or city. They include areas of built-up land with a minimum of 20 hectares (200,000 m2; 49 acres). Any areas [separated by] less than 200 metres [of non-urban space] are linked to become a single built-up area.[7] Urban land area (km2), 2010[8] Urban areas with at least one million inhabitants in 2006 Contents 1 Definitions 1.1 East Asia 1.1.1 China 1.1.2 Japan 1.2 South Asia 1.2.1 India 1.2.2 Pakistan 1.2.3 Bangladesh 1.3 Southeast Asia 1.3.1 Philippines 1.3.2 Vietnam 1.4 Europe 1.4.1 Finland 1.4.2 France 1.4.3 Germany 1.4.4 Netherlands 1.4.5 Sweden 1.4.6 United Kingdom 1.4.7 Norway 1.4.8 Poland 1.4.9 Russia 1.5 Oceania 1.5.1 Australia 1.5.2 New Zealand 1.6 North America 1.6.1 Canada 1.6.2 United States 1.7 South America 1.7.1 Argentina 1.7.2 Brazil 2 See also 3 References 4 External links Definitions[edit] European countries[which?] define urbanized areas on the basis of urban-type land use, not allowing any gaps of typically more than 200 metres (220 yd), and use satellite imagery instead of census blocks to determine the boundaries of the urban area. In less-developed countries[which?], in addition to land use and density requirements, a requirement that a large majority of the population, typically 75%, is not engaged in agriculture and/or fishing is sometimes used.[citation needed] East Asia[edit] China[edit] Main article: List of cities in China by population and built-up area Since 2000, China's cities have expanded at an average rate of 10% annually. It is estimated that China's urban population will increase by 292 million people by 2050,[2] when its cities will house a combined population of over one billion.[9] The country's urbanization rate increased from 17.4% to 46.6% between 1978 and 2009.[10] Between 150 and 200 million migrant workers work part-time in the major cities, returning home to the countryside periodically with their earnings.[11][12] Today, China has more cities with one million or more long-term residents than any other country, including the three global cities of Beijing, Hong Kong, and Shanghai; by 2025, the country will be home to 221 cities with over a million inhabitants.[9] The figures in the table below are from the 2008 census, and are only estimates of the urban populations within administrative city limits; a different ranking exists when considering the total municipal populations (which includes suburban and rural populations). The large ""floating populations"" of migrant workers make conducting censuses in urban areas difficult;[13] the figures below include only long-term residents. Panoramic view of Pudong's Skyline from the Bund in Shanghai. Japan[edit] In Japan urbanized areas are defined as contiguous areas of densely inhabited districts (DIDs) using census enumeration districts as units with a density requirement of 4,000 inhabitants per square kilometre (10,000/sq mi). South Asia[edit] India[edit] Main articles: Urbanisation in India and List of cities in India by population For the Census of India 2011, the definition of urban area is a place having a minimum population of 5,000 of density 400 persons per square kilometre (1,000/sq mi) or higher, and 75% plus of the male working population employed in non-agricultural activities. Places administered by a municipal corporation, cantonment board or notified town area committee are automatically considered urban areas.[14] The Census of India 2011 also defined the term ""urban agglomeration"" as an integrated urban area consisting of a core town together with its ""outgrowths"" (contiguous suburbs).[15] India gate panorama. vteLargest urban agglomerations in India by population(2011 census)[16][17] MumbaiDelhiKolkataChennaiBangaloreHyderabad Rank City Name State/Territory Population Rank City Name State/Territory Population AhmedabadPuneSuratJaipurKanpurLucknow 1 Mumbai Maharashtra 18,394,912 28 Ludhiana Punjab 1,618,879 2 Delhi Delhi 16,349,831 29 Nashik Maharashtra 1,562,769 3 Kolkata West Bengal 14,112,536 30 Vijayawada Andhra Pradesh 1,491,202 4 Chennai Tamil Nadu 8,696,010 31 Madurai Tamil Nadu 1,465,625 5 Bengaluru Karnataka 8,520,435 32 Varanasi Uttar Pradesh 1,435,113 6 Hyderabad Telangana 7,749,334 33 Meerut Uttar Pradesh 1,424,908 7 Ahmedabad Gujarat 6,361,084 34 Faridabad Haryana 1,414,050 8 Pune Maharashtra 5,057,709 35 Rajkot Gujarat 1,390,933 9 Surat Gujarat 4,591,246 36 Jamshedpur Jharkhand 1,339,438 10 Jaipur Rajasthan 3,073,350 37 Srinagar Jammu and Kashmir 1,273,312 11 Kanpur Uttar Pradesh 2,920,496 38 Jabalpur Madhya Pradesh 1,268,848 12 Lucknow Uttar Pradesh 2,902,920 39 Asansol West Bengal 1,243,414 13 Nagpur Maharashtra 2,497,870 40 Vasai-Virar Maharashtra 1,222,390 14 Ghaziabad Uttar Pradesh 2,375,820 41 Allahabad Uttar Pradesh 1,216,719 15 Indore Madhya Pradesh 2,170,295 42 Dhanbad Jharkhand 1,196,214 16 Coimbatore Tamil Nadu 2,151,466 43 Aurangabad Maharashtra 1,193,167 17 Kochi Kerala 2,119,724 44 Amritsar Punjab 1,183,705 18 Patna Bihar 2,049,156 45 Jodhpur Rajasthan 1,138,300 19 Kozhikode Kerala 2,030,519 46 Ranchi Jharkhand 1,126,741 20 Bhopal Madhya Pradesh 1,886,100 47 Raipur Chhattisgarh 1,123,558 21 Thrissur Kerala 1,861,269 48 Kollam Kerala 1,110,668 22 Vadodara Gujarat 1,822,221 49 Gwalior Madhya Pradesh 1,102,884 23 Agra Uttar Pradesh 1,760,285 50 Bhilai Chhattisgarh 1,064,222 24 Vishakhapatnam Andhra Pradesh 1,730,320 51 Chandigarh Chandigarh 1,026,459 25 Malappuram Kerala 1,699,060 52 Tiruchirappalli Tamil Nadu 1,022,518 26 Thiruvananthapuram Kerala 1,687,406 53 Kota Rajasthan 1,001,694 27 Kannur Kerala 1,642,892 54 Mysore Karnataka 990,900 Pakistan[edit] Main articles: Urbanisation in Pakistan and List of most populous cities in Pakistan In Pakistan, an area is a major city and municipality if it has more than 100,000 inhabitants according to census results. Cities include adjacent cantonments. Urbanisation in Pakistan has increased since the time of independence and has several different causes. The majority of southern Pakistan's population lives along the Indus River. Karachi is its most populous city.[18] In the northern half of the country, most of the population lives in an arc formed by the cities of Lahore, Faisalabad, Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Gujrat, Jhelum, Sargodha, Sheikhupura, Nowshera, Mardan and Peshawar. During 1990–2008, city dwellers made up 36% of Pakistan's population, making it the most urbanised nation in South Asia. Furthermore, 50% of Pakistanis live in towns of 5,000 people or more.[19] Karachi is the most populated city in Pakistan closely followed by Lahore according to the 2017 Census. Bangladesh[edit] In Bangladesh, there are total 532 urban areas, which are divided into three categories. Those are City Corporation, Municipal Corporation (Pourasova) and Upazila town. Among those urban areas, Dhaka is the largest city by population and area, with a population of 19.10 million.[20] In Bangladesh, there are total 11 City Corporations and 329 Municipal Corporations and 203 Small towns, which serves as the center for Upazilas. According to 2011 population census, Bangladesh has an urban population of 28%, with a growth rate of 2.8%.[21] At this growth rate, it is estimated that the urban population of Bangladesh will reach 79 million or 42% of total population by 2035.

This is not to be confused with the city / town designation used by municipalities.[23][24] France[edit] Main article: Urban area (France) In France, an urban area (Fr: aire urbaine) is a zone encompassing an area of built-up growth (called an ""urban unit"" (unité urbaine)[25] – close in definition to the North American urban area) and its commuter belt (couronne). Americans would find the INSEE definition of the urban area[26] to be similar to their metropolitan area, and the INSEE sometimes uses the term aire métropolitaine[27] to refer to the country's largest aires urbaines. The largest cities in France, in terms of urban area population (2017), are Paris (12,628,266), Lyon (2,323,221), Marseille (1,760,653), Toulouse (1,360,829), Bordeaux (1,247,977), Lille (1,191,117), Nice (1,006,201), Nantes (972,828), Strasbourg (790,087) and Rennes (733,320).[28] Panorama of Paris as seen from the Eiffel Tower as full 360-degree view (river flowing from north-east to south-west, right to left) Germany[edit] Germany has a number of large cities. The largest conurbation is the Rhine-Ruhr region (11 million in 2008[update]), including Düsseldorf (the capital of North Rhine-Westphalia), Cologne, Bonn, Dortmund, Essen, Duisburg, and Bochum.[29] vte Largest urban agglomerations in GermanyFederal Statistical Office of Germany (31 December 2017) Rank Name State Pop.

The Randstad is the country's largest conurbation located in the west of the country and contains the four largest cities: Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, and Utrecht. The Randstad has a population of 7 million inhabitants and is the 6th largest metropolitan area in Europe. Sweden[edit] Main article: List of urban areas in Sweden by population Urban areas in Sweden (tätorter) are statistically defined localities, totally independent of the administrative subdivision of the country. There are 1,956 such localities in Sweden, with a population ranging from 200 to 1,372,000 inhabitants.[30] United Kingdom[edit] Main article: List of urban areas in the United Kingdom In 2013 the United Kingdom's Office for National Statistics (ONS) published 2011 Built-up Areas - Methodology and Guidance which sets out its definition of a built-up area as an area of built-up land of at least 20 hectares (0.077 sq mi), separated from other settlements by at least 200 metres (660 ft). For 2011 census data there are 5,493 built-up areas, of which 501 are divided into sub-divisions for which data is also available. Each built-up area is named algorithmically, using Ordnance Survey place-name data.[31] The ONS has produced census results from urban areas since 1951, since 1981 based upon the extent of irreversible urban development indicated on Ordnance Survey maps. The definition is an extent of at least 20 ha and at least 1,500 census residents. Separate areas are linked if less than 200 m (220 yd) apart. Included are transportation features.[32] The UK has five Urban Areas with a population over a million and a further sixty nine with a population over one hundred thousand. vte Largest urban areas of the United Kingdom(England and Wales: 2011 census built-up area;[33] Scotland: 2016 estimates settlement;[34] Northern Ireland: 2001 census urban area)[35] Rank Urban area Pop.

Unlike in Denmark and Sweden, the distance between each building has to be of less than 50 m, although exceptions are made due to parks, industrial areas, rivers, and similar. Groups of houses less than 400 m from the main body of an urban area are included in the urban area.[36] Poland[edit] In Poland, official ""urban"" population figures simply refer to those localities which have the status of towns (miasta). The ""rural"" population is that of all areas outside the boundaries of these towns. This distinction may give a misleading impression in some cases, since some localities with only village status may have acquired larger and denser populations than many many smaller towns.[37] On the other hand, the Upper Silesian Industrial Region covers 3,200 km and has approximately 3 million people. Russia[edit] Moscow, the capital and largest city of Russia, has a population estimated at 12.4 million residents within the city limits,[38] while over 17 million residents in the urban area,[39] and over 20 million residents in the Moscow Metropolitan Area.[40] It is among the world's largest cities, being the most populous city entirely within Europe, the most populous urban area in Europe,[39] the most populous metropolitan area in Europe,[40] and also the largest city by land area on the European continent.[41] Saint Petersburg, the cultural capital, is the second-largest city, with a population of roughly 5.4 million inhabitants.[42] Other major urban areas are Yekaterinburg, Novosibirsk, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod, and Chelyabinsk. Moscow, the capital and largest city of Russia Saint Petersburg, the cultural capital and the second-largest city Yekaterinburg, the fourth-largest city in the country. Oceania[edit] Australia[edit] In Australia, urban areas are referred to as ""urban centres"" and are defined as population clusters of 1,000 or more people, with a density of at least 200/km2 (518/sq mi)[43] Australia is one of the most urbanised countries in the world, with more than 50% of the population residing in Australia's three biggest urban centres. Sydney is Australia's largest city, home to 5.3 million inhabitants.[44] New Zealand[edit] Main article: Urban areas of New Zealand Statistics New Zealand defines urban areas in New Zealand, which are independent of any administrative subdivisions and have no legal basis.[45] There are three classes of urban area: main urban areas are the 17 urban areas which have a population of 30,000 or more; secondary urban areas are the 14 urban areas which have a population of 10,000 or more but less than 30,000, and minor urban areas are the 103 urban areas which have a population of 1,000 or more but less than 10,000. Urban areas are reclassified after each New Zealand census, so population changes between censuses does not change an urban area's classification. North America[edit] Canada[edit] Main article: List of the 100 largest population centres in Canada According to Statistics Canada, an urban area in Canada is an area with a population of at least 1,000 people where the density is no fewer than 400 persons per square kilometre (1,000/sq mi).[46] If two or more urban areas are within 2 km (1.2 mi) of each other by road, they are merged into a single urban area, provided they do not cross census metropolitan area or census agglomeration boundaries.[47] In the Canada 2011 Census, Statistics Canada redesignated urban areas with the new term ""population centre"";[48] the new term was chosen in order to better reflect the fact that urban vs. rural is not a strict division, but rather a continuum within which several distinct settlement patterns may exist. For example, a community may fit a strictly statistical definition of an urban area, but may not be commonly thought of as ""urban"" because it has a smaller population, or functions socially and economically as a suburb of another urban area rather than as a self-contained urban entity, or is geographically remote from other urban communities. Accordingly, the new definition set out three distinct types of population centres: small (population 1,000 to 29,999), medium (population 30,000 to 99,999) and large (population 100,000 or greater).[48] Despite the change in terminology, however, the demographic definition of a population centre remains unchanged from that of an urban area: a population of at least 1,000 people where the density is no fewer than 400 persons per km2. United States[edit] Main article: List of United States urban areas In the United States, there are two categories of urban area. The term urbanized area denotes an urban area of 50,000 or more people. Urban areas under 50,000 people are called urban clusters. Urbanized areas were first delineated in the United States in the 1950 census, while urban clusters were added in the 2000 census. There are 1,371 urban areas and urban clusters with more than 10,000 people. The U.S. Census Bureau defines an urban area as ""core census block groups or blocks that have a population density of at least 1,000 people per square mile (386 per square kilometer) and surrounding census blocks that have an overall density of at least 500 people per square mile (193 per square kilometer)"".[49] The largest urban area in the United States is the New York metropolitan area. The population of New York City, the core of the metropolitan area, exceeds 8.5 million people, its metropolitan statistical area has a population that is over 20 million, and its combined statistical area population is over 23 million. The next seven largest urban areas in the U.S. are Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Houston, and Atlanta.[50] About 82 percent of the population of the United States lives within the boundaries of an urbanized area as of December, 2010.[51] Combined, these areas occupy about 2 percent of the land area of the United States. Many Americans live in agglomerations of cities, suburbs, and towns that are adjacent to a metropolitan area's largest city.[citation needed] The skyscrapers of New York City, the most populous city in the United States and the most populous U.S. metropolitan area, are almost all situated in Manhattan, the world's largest central business district, seen here in this panorama in February 2018, as viewed from Weehawken, New Jersey.

For example, the city of Greenville, South Carolina has a city population just over 68,000 and an urbanized area population of around 400,000, while Greensboro, North Carolina has a city population just over 285,000 and an urbanized area population of around 300,000 — meaning that Greenville is actually ""larger"" for some intents and purposes, but not for others, such as taxation, local elections, etc. In the U.S. Department of Agriculture's natural resources inventory, urban areas are officially known as developed areas or urban and built-up areas. Such areas include cities, ethnic villages, other built-up areas of more than 10 ac (4 ha), industrial sites, railroad yards, cemeteries, airports, golf courses, shooting ranges, institutional and public administration sites, and similar areas. The 1997 national resources inventory placed over 98,000,000 ac (40,000,000 ha) in this category, an increase of 25,000,000 ac (10,000,000 ha) since 1982.[52] South America[edit] Argentina[edit] Argentina is highly urbanized.[53] The ten largest metropolitan areas account for half of the population, and fewer than one in ten live in rural areas. About 3 million people live in Buenos Aires City and the Greater Buenos Aires metropolitan area totals around 15 million, making it one of the largest urban areas in the world, with a population of 18 million all up.[54] Córdoba has around 1.5 million people living in the urban area, while Rosario, Mendoza and Tucumán have around 1.2 million inhabitants each[54] and La Plata, Mar del Plata, Salta and Santa Fe[54][55] have at least 500,000 people each. Brazil[edit] Main article: List of largest cities in Brazil According to IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) urban areas already concentrate 84.35% of the population, while the Southeast region remains the most populated one, with over 80 million inhabitants.[56] The largest metropolitan areas in Brazil are São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Belo Horizonte — all in the Southeastern Region — with 21, 12, and 5 million inhabitants respectively.[57] In general, state capitals are the largest cities in their states, except for Vitória, the capital of Espírito Santo, and Florianópolis, the capital of Santa Catarina. There are also non-capital metropolitan areas in the states of São Paulo (Campinas, Santos and the Paraíba Valley), Minas Gerais (Steel Valley), Rio Grande do Sul (Sinos Valley) and Santa Catarina (Itajaí Valley).[58] São Paulo, the largest city in Brazil, the largest city proper in the Southern Hemisphere, in the Americas, and the world's ninth-largest urban area by population.[59] vte Largest urban agglomerations in Brazil2017 Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics estimates[60][61][62] Rank Name State Pop.

As of July 2019[update], it was the fifth most populous city in the state, behind Boston, Worcester, Springfield, and Lowell.[6] According to the 2010 Census, the city's population was 105,162.[7] It is one of two de jure county seats of Middlesex County, although the county's government was abolished in 1997. Situated directly north of Boston, across the Charles River, it was named in honor of the University of Cambridge in England, once also an important center of the Puritan theology embraced by the town's founders.[8]:18 Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Lesley University, and Hult International Business School are in Cambridge,[9] as was Radcliffe College before it merged with Harvard. Kendall Square in Cambridge has been called ""the most innovative square mile on the planet"" owing to the high concentration of successful startups that have emerged in the vicinity of the square since 2010.[10][11] Contents 1 History 2 Geography 2.1 Adjacent municipalities 2.2 Neighborhoods 2.2.1 Squares 2.2.1.1 Gallery 2.2.2 Other neighborhoods 2.2.3 Climate 3 Demographics 3.1 Income 4 Economy 4.1 Top employers 5 Arts and culture 5.1 Museums 5.2 Public art 5.3 Architecture 5.4 Music 5.5 Parks and recreation 6 Government 6.1 Federal and state representation 6.2 Politics 6.3 City government 6.4 County government 7 Education 7.1 Higher education 7.2 Primary and secondary public education 7.3 Primary and secondary private education 8 Media 8.1 Newspapers 8.2 Radio 8.3 Television and broadband 9 Infrastructure 9.1 Utilities 9.2 Water department 9.3 Transportation 9.3.1 Road 9.3.2 Mass transit 9.3.3 Cycling 9.3.4 Walking 9.3.5 Intercity 9.4 Police department 9.5 Fire department 9.6 Emergency medical services (EMS) 9.7 Public library services 10 Sister cities and twin towns 11 Notes 12 References 12.1 Citations 12.2 Sources 13 External links History[edit] See also: Timeline of Cambridge, Massachusetts Map showing the original boundaries of Cambridge and other Massachusetts cities and towns In December 1630, the site of what would become Cambridge was chosen because it was safely upriver from Boston Harbor, making it easily defensible from attacks by enemy ships. Thomas Dudley, his daughter Anne Bradstreet, and her husband, Simon Bradstreet, were the town's founders. The first houses were built in the spring of 1631. The settlement was initially referred to as ""the newe towne"".[12][13] Official Massachusetts records show the name rendered as Newe Towne by 1632, and as Newtowne by 1638.[13][14] Located at the first convenient Charles River crossing west of Boston, Newtowne was one of several towns (including Boston, Dorchester, Watertown, and Weymouth) founded by the 700 original Puritan colonists of the Massachusetts Bay Colony under Governor John Winthrop. Its first preacher was Thomas Hooker, who led many of its original inhabitants west in 1636 to found Hartford and the Connecticut Colony; before leaving, they sold their plots to more recent immigrants from England.[12] The original village site is now within Harvard Square. The marketplace where farmers sold crops from surrounding towns at the edge of a salt marsh (since filled) remains within a small park at the corner of John F. Kennedy and Winthrop Streets. In 1636, the Newe College (later renamed Harvard College after benefactor John Harvard) was founded by the Massachusetts Bay Colony to train ministers. According to Cotton Mather, Newtowne was chosen for the site of the college by the Great and General Court (the Massachusetts legislature) primarily for its proximity to the popular and highly respected Puritan preacher Thomas Shepard. In May 1638,[15] the settlement's name was changed to Cambridge in honor of the university in Cambridge, England.[12][16] The town comprised a much larger area than the present city,[12] with various outlying parts becoming independent towns over the years: Cambridge Village (later Newtown and now Newton) in 1688,[17] Cambridge Farms (now Lexington) in 1712[12] or 1713,[18] and Little or South Cambridge (now Brighton)[a] and Menotomy or West Cambridge (now Arlington) in 1807.[12][19][b] In the late 19th century, various schemes for annexing Cambridge to Boston were pursued and rejected.[20] Newtowne's ministers, Hooker and Shepard, the college's first president, the college's major benefactor, and the first schoolmaster Nathaniel Eaton were all Cambridge alumni, as was the colony's governor John Winthrop. In 1629, Winthrop had led the signing of the founding document of the city of Boston, which was known as the Cambridge Agreement, after the university.[21] In 1650, Governor Thomas Dudley signed the charter creating the corporation that still governs Harvard College.[22] George Washington in Cambridge, 1775 Cambridge grew slowly as an agricultural village eight miles (13 km) by road from Boston, the colony's capital. By the American Revolution, most residents lived near the Common and Harvard College, with most of the town comprising farms and estates. Most inhabitants were descendants of the original Puritan colonists, but there was also a small elite of Anglican ""worthies"" who were not involved in village life, made their livings from estates, investments, and trade, and lived in mansions along ""the Road to Watertown"" (today's Brattle Street, still known as Tory Row). Coming north from Virginia, George Washington took command of the volunteer American soldiers camped on Cambridge Common on July 3, 1775,[12] now reckoned the birthplace of the U.S. Army.[c] Most of the Tory estates were confiscated after the Revolution. On January 24, 1776, Henry Knox arrived with artillery captured from Fort Ticonderoga, which enabled Washington to drive the British army out of Boston. Map of Cambridge from 1873 Between 1790 and 1840, Cambridge grew rapidly, with the construction of the West Boston Bridge in 1792 connecting Cambridge directly to Boston, so that it was no longer necessary to travel eight miles (13 km) through the Boston Neck, Roxbury, and Brookline to cross the Charles River. A second bridge, the Canal Bridge, opened in 1809 alongside the new Middlesex Canal. The new bridges and roads made what were formerly estates and marshland into prime industrial and residential districts. In the mid-19th century, Cambridge was the center of a literary revolution. It was home to some of the famous Fireside Poets—so called because their poems would often be read aloud by families in front of their evening fires. The Fireside Poets—Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, James Russell Lowell, and Oliver Wendell Holmes—were highly popular and influential in their day. Soon after, turnpikes were built: the Cambridge and Concord Turnpike (today's Broadway and Concord Ave.), the Middlesex Turnpike (Hampshire St. and Massachusetts Ave. northwest of Porter Square), and what are today's Cambridge, Main, and Harvard Streets connected various areas of Cambridge to the bridges. In addition, the town was connected to the Boston & Maine Railroad,[23] leading to the development of Porter Square as well as the creation of neighboring Somerville from the formerly rural parts of Charlestown. 1852 Map of Boston area showing Cambridge and regional rail lines and highlighting the course of the Middlesex Canal. Cambridge is toward the bottom of the map and outlined in yellow, and should not be confused with the pink-outlined and partially cropped ""West Cambridge"", now Arlington. Cambridge was incorporated as a city in 1846[12] despite persistent tensions between East Cambridge, Cambridgeport, and Old Cambridge stemming from differences in culture, sources of income, and the national origins of the residents.[24] The city's commercial center began to shift from Harvard Square to Central Square, which became the city's downtown around that time. Between 1850 and 1900, Cambridge took on much of its present character—streetcar suburban development along the turnpikes, with working-class and industrial neighborhoods focused on East Cambridge, comfortable middle-class housing on the old Cambridgeport and Mid-Cambridge estates, and upper-class enclaves near Harvard University and on the minor hills. The coming of the railroad to North Cambridge and Northwest Cambridge led to three major changes: the development of massive brickyards and brickworks between Massachusetts Ave., Concord Ave. and Alewife Brook; the ice-cutting industry launched by Frederic Tudor on Fresh Pond; and the carving up of the last estates into residential subdivisions to house the thousands of immigrants who arrived to work in the new industries. For many decades, the city's largest employer was the New England Glass Company, founded in 1818. By the middle of the 19th century, it was the world's largest and most modern glassworks. In 1888, Edward Drummond Libbey moved all production to Toledo, Ohio, where it continues today under the name Owens-Illinois. The company's flint glassware with heavy lead content is prized by antique glass collectors. There is none on public display in Cambridge, but the Toledo Museum of Art has a large collection. The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and the Sandwich Glass Museum on Cape Cod also have a few pieces. In 1895, Edwin Ginn, founder of Ginn and Company built the Athenaeum Press Building for his publishing textbook empire. By 1920, Cambridge was one of New England's main industrial cities, with nearly 120,000 residents. Among the largest businesses in Cambridge during the period of industrialization was Carter's Ink Company, whose neon sign long adorned the Charles River and which was for many years the world's largest ink manufacturer. Next door was the Athenaeum Press. Confectionery and snack manufacturers in the Cambridgeport-Area 4-Kendall corridor included the Kennedy Biscuit Factory (later part of Nabisco and originator of the Fig Newton),[25] Necco, Squirrel Brands,[26] George Close Company (1861–1930s),[27] Page & Shaw, Daggett Chocolate (1892–1960s, recipes bought by Necco),[28] Fox Cross Company (1920–1980, originator of the Charleston Chew, and now part of Tootsie Roll Industries),[29] Kendall Confectionery Company, and James O. Welch (1927–1963, originator of Junior Mints, Sugar Daddies, Sugar Mamas, and Sugar Babies, now part of Tootsie Roll Industries).[30] Only the Cambridge Brands subsidiary of Tootsie Roll Industries remains in town, still manufacturing Junior Mints in the old Welch factory on Main Street.[30] The Blake and Knowles Steam Pump Company (1886), the Kendall Boiler and Tank Company (1880, now in Chelmsford, Massachusetts), and the New England Glass Company (1818–1878) were among the industrial manufacturers in what are now Kendall Square and East Cambridge. In 1935, the Cambridge Housing Authority and the Public Works Administration demolished an integrated low-income tenement neighborhood with African Americans and European immigrants, built in its place the whites-only ""Newtowne Court"" public housing development and the adjoining segregated ""Washington Elms"" project for Black people in 1940, and the city required segregation in its other public housing projects as well.[31][32][33] As industry in New England began to decline during the Great Depression and after World War II, Cambridge lost much of its industrial base. It also began to become an intellectual, rather than an industrial, center. Harvard University had always been important as both a landowner and an institution, but it began to play a more dominant role in the city's life and culture. When Radcliffe College was established in 1879 the town became a mecca for some of the nation's most academically talented female students. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology's move from Boston in 1916 reinforced Cambridge's status as an intellectual center of the United States. After the 1950s, the city's population began to decline slowly as families tended to be replaced by single people and young couples. In Cambridge Highlands, the technology company Bolt, Beranek, & Newman produced the first network router in 1969 and hosted the invention of computer-to-computer email in 1971. The 1980s brought a wave of high-technology startups. Those selling advanced minicomputers were overtaken by the microcomputer.[citation needed] Cambridge-based VisiCorp made the first spreadsheet software for personal computers, Visicalc, and helped propel the Apple II to major consumer success. It was overtaken and purchased by Cambridge-based Lotus Development, maker of Lotus 1-2-3. (This was in turn replaced in the market by Microsoft Excel). The city continues to be home to many startups. Kendall Square was a major software hub through the dot-com boom and today hosts offices of such technology companies as Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. The Square also now houses the headquarters of Akamai.[34] In 1976, Harvard's plans to start experiments with recombinant DNA led to a three-month moratorium and a citizen review panel. In the end, Cambridge decided to allow such experiments but passed safety regulations in 1977. This led to regulatory certainty and acceptance when Biogen opened a lab in 1982, in contrast to the hostility that caused the Genetic Institute (a Harvard spinoff) to abandon Somerville and Boston for Cambridge.[35] The biotech and pharmaceutical industries have since thrived in Cambridge, which now includes headquarters for Biogen and Genzyme; laboratories for Novartis, Teva, Takeda, Alnylam, Ironwood, Catabasis, Moderna Therapeutics, Editas Medicine; support companies such as Cytel; and many smaller companies. By the end of the 20th century, Cambridge had one of the most costly housing markets in the Northeastern United States.[36] While considerable class, race, and age diversity persisted, it became harder for those who grew up in the city to afford to stay. The end of rent control in 1994 prompted many Cambridge renters to move to more affordable housing in Somerville and other cities or towns. Until recently, Cambridge's mix of amenities and proximity to Boston kept housing prices relatively stable despite the bursting of the United States housing bubble.[37] Cambridge has been a sanctuary city since 1985 and reaffirmed its status as such in 2006.[38] Geography[edit] A view from Boston of Harvard's Weld Boathouse and Cambridge in winter. The Charles River is in the foreground. According to the United States Census Bureau, Cambridge has a total area of 7.1 square miles (18 km2), of which 6.4 square miles (17 km2) is land and 0.7 square miles (1.8 km2) (9.82%) is water. Adjacent municipalities[edit] Cambridge is located in eastern Massachusetts, bordered by: the city of Boston to the south (across the Charles River) and east the city of Somerville to the north the town of Arlington to the northwest the town of Belmont and the city of Watertown to the west The border between Cambridge and the neighboring city of Somerville passes through densely populated neighborhoods which are connected by the MBTA Red Line. Some of the main squares, Inman, Porter, and to a lesser extent, Harvard and Lechmere, are very close to the city line, as are Somerville's Union and Davis Squares. Through the City of Cambridge's exclusive municipal water system, the city further controls two exclave areas, one being Payson Park Reservoir and Gatehouse, a 2009 listed American Water Landmark located roughly one mile west of Fresh Pond and surrounded by the town of Belmont. The second area is the larger Hobbs Brook and Stony Brook watersheds, which share borders with neighboring towns and cities including Lexington, Lincoln, Waltham and Weston.

(March 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Squares[edit] Cambridge has been called the ""City of Squares"",[39] as most of its commercial districts are major street intersections known as squares. Each square acts as a neighborhood center. These include: Kendall Square, formed by the junction of Broadway, Main Street, and Third Street, has been called ""the most innovative square mile on the planet"", owing to its high concentration of entrepreneurial start-ups and quality of innovation which have emerged in the vicinity of the square since 2010.[10][11] Technology Square is an office and laboratory building cluster in this neighborhood. Just over the Longfellow Bridge from Boston, at the eastern end of the MIT campus, it is served by the Kendall/MIT station on the MBTA Red Line subway. Most of Cambridge's large office towers are located in the Square. A biotech industry has developed in this area. The Cambridge Innovation Center, a large co-working space, is in Kendall Square at 1 Broadway. The Cambridge Center office complex is in Kendall Square, and not at the actual center of Cambridge. The ""One Kendall Square"" complex is nearby, but not actually in Kendall Square. Central Square, formed by the junction of Massachusetts Avenue, Prospect Street, and Western Avenue. Containing a variety of ethnic restaurants, it was economically depressed as recently as the late 1990s; it underwent gentrification in recent years (in conjunction with the development of the nearby University Park at MIT), and continues to grow more costly. It is served by the Central Station stop on the MBTA Red Line subway. Lafayette Square, formed by the junction of Massachusetts Avenue, Columbia Street, Sidney Street, and Main Street, is considered part of the Central Square area. Cambridgeport is south of Central Square along Magazine Street and Brookline Street. Harvard Square, formed by the junction of Massachusetts Avenue, Brattle Street, and JFK Street. This is the primary site of Harvard University and a major Cambridge shopping area. It is served by a Red Line station. Harvard Square was originally the Red Line's northwestern terminus and a major transfer point to streetcars that also operated in a short tunnel—which is still a major bus terminal, although the area under the Square was reconfigured dramatically in the 1980s when the Red Line was extended. The Harvard Square area includes Brattle Square and Eliot Square. A short distance away from the square lies the Cambridge Common, while the neighborhood north of Harvard and east of Massachusetts Avenue is known as Agassiz, after the famed scientist Louis Agassiz. Porter Square, about a mile north on Massachusetts Avenue from Harvard Square, at the junction of Massachusetts and Somerville Avenues. It includes part of the city of Somerville and is served by the Porter Square Station, a complex housing a Red Line stop and a Fitchburg Line commuter rail stop. Lesley University's University Hall and Porter campus are in Porter Square. Inman Square, at the junction of Cambridge and Hampshire streets in mid-Cambridge. It is home to restaurants, bars, music venues, and boutiques. Victorian streetlights, benches, and bus stops were recently added to the streets, and a new city park was installed. Lechmere Square, at the junction of Cambridge and First streets, adjacent to the CambridgeSide Galleria shopping mall. It is the MBTA Green Line's northern terminus, at Lechmere Station. Gallery[edit] Cambridge skyline in November 2016 Areas of Cambridge Central Square Harvard Square Inman Square Other neighborhoods[edit] Cambridge's residential neighborhoods border but are not defined by the squares.

Harvard and MIT together employ about 20,000.[66][67] As a cradle of technological innovation, Cambridge was home to technology firms Analog Devices, Akamai, Bolt, Beranek, and Newman (BBN Technologies) (now part of Raytheon), General Radio (later GenRad), Lotus Development Corporation (now part of IBM), Polaroid, Symbolics, and Thinking Machines. In 1996, Polaroid, Arthur D. Little, and Lotus were Cambridge's top employers, with over 1,000 employees, but they faded out a few years later. Health care and biotechnology firms such as Genzyme, Biogen Idec, bluebird bio, Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Sanofi, Pfizer and Novartis[68] have significant presences in the city. Though headquartered in Switzerland, Novartis continues to expand its operations in Cambridge. Other major biotech and pharmaceutical firms expanding their presence in Cambridge include GlaxoSmithKline, AstraZeneca, Shire, and Pfizer.[69] Most of Cambridge's biotech firms are in Kendall Square and East Cambridge, which decades ago were the city's center of manufacturing. Some others are in University Park at MIT, a new development in another former manufacturing area.[70][71] None of the high-technology firms that once dominated the economy was among the 25 largest employers in 2005, but by 2008 Akamai and ITA Software were.[66] Google,[72] IBM Research, Microsoft Research, and Philips Research[73] maintain offices in Cambridge. In late January 2012—less than a year after acquiring Billerica-based analytic database management company, Vertica—Hewlett-Packard announced it would also be opening its first offices in Cambridge.[74] Also around that time, e-commerce giants Staples[75] and Amazon.com[76] said they would be opening research and innovation centers in Kendall Square. And LabCentral provides a shared laboratory facility for approximately 25 emerging biotech companies.[77][78][unreliable source?] The proximity of Cambridge's universities has also made the city a center for nonprofit groups and think tanks, including the National Bureau of Economic Research, the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, Cultural Survival, and One Laptop per Child.[citation needed] In September 2011, the City of Cambridge launched the ""Entrepreneur Walk of Fame"" initiative. The Walk recognizes people who have made contributions to innovation in global business.[79] Top employers[edit] This section is in list format, but may read better as prose.

Temporary public artworks are displayed as part of the annual Cambridge River Festival on the banks of the Charles River, during winter celebrations in Harvard and Central Squares, and at university campus sites. Experimental forms of public artistic and cultural expression include the Central Square World's Fair, the annual Somerville-based Honk! Festival,[83] and If This House Could Talk,[84] a neighborhood art and history event. Street musicians and other performers entertain tourists and locals in Harvard Square during the warmer months. The performances are coordinated through a public process that has been developed collaboratively by the performers,[85] city administrators, private organizations and business groups.[86] The Cambridge public library contains four Works Progress Administration murals completed in 1935 by Elizabeth Tracy Montminy: Religion, Fine Arts, History of Books and Paper, and The Development of the Printing Press.[87] Longfellow House–Washington's Headquarters National Historic Site Stata Center, MIT Simmons Hall, MIT Architecture[edit] This section is in list format, but may read better as prose.

The city also has abundant contemporary architecture, largely built by Harvard and MIT. Notable historic buildings in the city include: The Asa Gray House (1810) Austin Hall, Harvard University (1882–84) Cambridge City Hall (1888–89) Cambridge Public Library (1888) Christ Church, Cambridge (1761) Cooper-Frost-Austin House (1689–1817) Elmwood House (1767), residence of the president of Harvard University First Church of Christ, Scientist (1924–30) The First Parish in Cambridge (1833) Harvard-Epworth United Methodist Church (1891–93) Harvard Lampoon Building (1909) The Hooper-Lee-Nichols House (1685–1850) Longfellow House–Washington's Headquarters National Historic Site (1759), former home of poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and headquarters of George Washington The Memorial Church of Harvard University (1932) Memorial Hall, Harvard University (1870–77) Middlesex County Courthouse (1814–48) Urban Rowhouse (1875) O'Reilly Spite House (1908), built to spite a neighbor who would not sell his adjacent land[88] See also: List of Registered Historic Places in Cambridge, Massachusetts Contemporary architecture: Baker House dormitory, MIT, by Finnish architect Alvar Aalto, one of only two Aalto buildings in the US Harvard Graduate Center/Harkness Commons, by The Architects Collaborative (TAC, with Walter Gropius) Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts, Harvard, the only Le Corbusier building in North America Harvard's Science Center, Holyoke Center and Peabody Terrace, by Catalan architect and Harvard Graduate School of Design Dean Josep Lluís Sert Kresge Auditorium, MIT, by Eero Saarinen MIT Chapel, by Eero Saarinen Design Research Building, by Benjamin Thompson and Associates American Academy of Arts and Sciences, by Kallmann McKinnell and Wood, also architects of Boston City Hall Arthur M.

Beyond its colleges and universities, Cambridge has many music venues, including The Middle East, Club Passim, The Plough and Stars, The Lizard Lounge and the Nameless Coffeehouse. Parks and recreation[edit] Alewife Brook Reservation Consisting largely of densely built residential space, Cambridge lacks significant tracts of public parkland. Easily accessible open space on the university campuses, including Harvard Yard, the Radcliffe Yard, and MIT's Great Lawn, as well as the considerable open space of Mount Auburn Cemetery and Fresh Pond Reservation, partly compensates for this. At Cambridge's western edge, the cemetery is known as a garden cemetery because of its landscaping (the oldest planned landscape in the country) and arboretum. Although known as a Cambridge landmark, much of the cemetery lies within Watertown.[89] It is also an Important Bird Area (IBA) in the Greater Boston area. Fresh Pond Reservation is the largest open green space in Cambridge with 162 acres (656,000 m2) of land around a 155-acre (627,000 m2) kettle hole lake. This land includes a 2.25-mile walking trail around the reservoir and a public 9-hole golf course.[90] Public parkland includes the esplanade along the Charles River, which mirrors its Boston counterpart; Cambridge Common, a busy and historic public park adjacent to Harvard's campus; Danehy Park, formerly a landfill; and the Alewife Brook Reservation. Government[edit] Federal and state representation[edit] Voter registration and party enrollment as of February 12, 2020[update][91] Party Number of voters Percentage Democratic 39,916 56.48% Republican 2,126 3.01% Unaffiliated 27,922 39.51% Minor Parties 213 0.31% Total 70,674 100% Cambridge is split between Massachusetts's 5th and 7th U.S. congressional districts. The 5th district seat is held by Democrat Katherine Clark, who replaced now-Senator Ed Markey in a 2013 special election; the 7th is represented by Democrat Ayanna Pressley, elected in 2018. The state's senior United States Senator is Democrat Elizabeth Warren, elected in 2012, who lives in Cambridge. The governor of Massachusetts is Republican Charlie Baker, elected in 2014. Cambridge is represented in six districts in the Massachusetts House of Representatives: the 24th Middlesex (which includes parts of Belmont and Arlington), the 25th and 26th Middlesex (the latter of which includes a portion of Somerville), the 29th Middlesex (which includes a small part of Watertown), and the Eighth and Ninth Suffolk (both including parts of the City of Boston).[92] The city is represented in the Massachusetts Senate as a part of the 2nd Middlesex, Middlesex and Suffolk, and 1st Suffolk and Middlesex districts.[93] Politics[edit] From 1860 to 1880, Republicans Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, Rutherford B. Hayes, and James Garfield each won Cambridge, Grant doing so by margins of over 20 points in both of his campaigns. Following that, from 1884–1892, Grover Cleveland won Cambridge in all three of his presidential campaigns, by less than ten points each time. Then from 1896 to 1924, Cambridge became something of a ""swing"" city with a slight Republican lean. GOP nominees carried the city in five of the eight presidential elections during that time frame, with five of the elections resulting in either a plurality or a margin of victory of fewer than ten points. The city of Cambridge is extremely Democratic in modern times, however. In the last 23 presidential elections dating back to the nomination of Al Smith in 1928, the Democratic nominee has carried Cambridge in every election. Every Democratic nominee since Massachusetts native John F. Kennedy in 1960 has received at least 70% of the vote, except for Jimmy Carter in 1976 and 1980. Since 1928, the only Republican nominee to come within ten points of carrying Cambridge is Dwight Eisenhower in his 1956 re-election bid.

There is also a six-member school committee that functions alongside the superintendent of public schools. The councilors and school committee members are elected every two years using proportional representation.[125] The mayor is elected by the city councilors from among themselves and serves as the chair of city council meetings. The mayor also sits on the school committee. The mayor is not the city's chief executive. Rather, the city manager, who is appointed by the city council, serves in that capacity. Under the city's Plan E form of government, the city council does not have the power to appoint or remove city officials who are under the direction of the city manager. The city council and its members are also forbidden from giving orders to any subordinate of the city manager.[126] Louis DePasquale is the City Manager, having succeeded Lisa C. Peterson, the Acting City Manager and Cambridge's first woman City Manager, on November 14, 2016.[127] Peterson became Acting City Manager on September 30, 2016, after Richard C. Rossi announced that he would opt out of his contract renewal.[128] Rossi succeeded Robert W. Healy, who retired in June 2013 after 32 years in the position. In recent history, the media has highlighted the salary of the city manager as one of the highest for a Massachusetts civic employee.[129] District Councillor In office since At-large Dennis J.

Though the county government was abolished in 1997, the county still exists as a geographical and political region. The employees of Middlesex County courts, jails, registries, and other county agencies now work directly for the state. The county's registrars of Deeds and Probate remain in Cambridge, but the Superior Court and District Attorney have had their operations transferred to Woburn. Third District Court has shifted operations to Medford, and the county Sheriff's office awaits near-term relocation.[131] Education[edit] This section is in list format, but may read better as prose.

(December 2019) Aerial view of part of MIT's main campus Dunster House, Harvard Higher education[edit] Cambridge is perhaps best known as an academic and intellectual center. Its colleges and universities include: Cambridge School of Culinary Arts Harvard University Hult International Business School Lesley University Longy School of Music of Bard College Massachusetts Institute of Technology Radcliffe College (now merged with Harvard College) At least 258 of the world's total 962 Nobel Prize winners have at some point in their careers been affiliated with universities in Cambridge. The American Academy of Arts and Sciences is also based in Cambridge.

Primary and secondary private education[edit] The 1888 part of the Cambridge Public Library Cambridge also has several private schools, including: Boston Archdiocesan Choir School Buckingham Browne & Nichols School Cambridge Montessori school Cambridge Friends School Fayerweather Street School[136] International School of Boston (formerly École Bilingue) Matignon High School Shady Hill School St. Peter School Media[edit] Newspapers[edit] Cambridge is served by the Cambridge Chronicle, the oldest surviving weekly paper in the United States. Another popular online newspaper is Cambridge Day. Radio[edit] Cambridge is home to the following commercially licensed and student-run radio stations: Callsign Frequency City/town Licensee Format WHRB 95.3 FM Cambridge (Harvard) Harvard Radio Broadcasting Co., Inc. Musical variety WJIB 740 AM/101.3 FM Cambridge Bob Bittner Broadcasting Adult standards/Pop WMBR 88.1 FM Cambridge (MIT) Technology Broadcasting Corporation College radio Television and broadband[edit] Cambridge Community Television (CCTV) has served the city since its inception in 1988. CCTV operates Cambridge's public access television facility and three television channels, 8, 9, and 96, on the Cambridge cable system (Comcast). The city has invited tenders from other cable providers, but Comcast remains its only fixed television and broadband utility,[137] though services from American satellite TV providers are available. In October 2014, Cambridge City Manager Richard Rossi appointed a citizen Broadband Task Force to ""examine options to increase competition, reduce pricing, and improve speed, reliability and customer service for both residents and businesses.""[138] Infrastructure[edit] Utilities[edit] Cable television service is provided by Comcast Communications. Parts of Cambridge are served by a district heating systems loop for industrial organizations that also cover Boston. Electric service and natural gas are both provided by Eversource Energy. Landline service is provided by Verizon Communication. All phones in Cambridge are connected to Verizon's series of central office locations in the metropolitan area. The city maintains its own Public, educational, and government access (PEG) known as Cambridge Community Television (CCTV). Water department[edit] Cambridge obtains water from Hobbs Brook (in Lincoln and Waltham) and Stony Brook (Waltham and Weston), as well as an emergency connection to the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority.[139] The city owns over 1,200 acres (486 ha) of land in other towns that includes these reservoirs and portions of their watershed.[140] Water from these reservoirs flows by gravity through an aqueduct to Fresh Pond in Cambridge. It is then treated in an adjacent plant and pumped uphill to an elevation of 176 feet (54 m) above sea level at the Payson Park Reservoir (Belmont). The water is then redistributed downhill via gravity to individual users in the city.[141] A new water treatment plant opened in 2001.[142] In October 2016, the City of Cambridge announced that, owing to drought conditions, they would begin buying water from the MWRA.[143] On January 3, 2017, Cambridge announced that ""As a result of continued rainfall each month since October 2016, we have been able to significantly reduce the need to use MWRA water. We have not purchased any MWRA water since December 12, 2016 and if 'average' rainfall continues this could continue for several months.""[144] Sewer service is available in Cambridge. The city is inter-connected with the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA)'s sewage network with sewage treatment plant in the Boston Harbor. Transportation[edit] See also: Boston transportation Road[edit] Massachusetts Avenue in Harvard Square Several major roads lead to Cambridge, including Route 2, Route 16, and the McGrath Highway (Route 28). The Massachusetts Turnpike does not pass through Cambridge but provides access by an exit in nearby Allston. Both U.S. Route 1 and Interstate 93 also provide additional access on the eastern end of Cambridge at Leverett Circle in Boston. Route 2A runs the length of the city, chiefly along Massachusetts Avenue. The Charles River forms the southern border of Cambridge and is crossed by 11 bridges connecting Cambridge to Boston, including the Longfellow Bridge and the Harvard Bridge, eight of which are open to motorized road traffic. Cambridge has an irregular street network because many of the roads date from the colonial era. Contrary to popular belief, the road system did not evolve from longstanding cow-paths. Roads connected various village settlements with each other and nearby towns and were shaped by geographic features, most notably streams, hills, and swampy areas. Today, the major ""squares"" are typically connected by long, mostly straight roads, such as Massachusetts Avenue between Harvard Square and Central Square, or Hampshire Street between Kendall Square and Inman Square. Mass transit[edit] Central Station on the MBTA Red Line Cambridge is served by the MBTA, including the Porter Square Station on the regional Commuter Rail; the Lechmere Station on the Green Line; and the Red Line at Alewife, Porter Square, Harvard Square, Central Square, and Kendall Square/MIT Stations. Alewife Station, the terminus of the Red Line, has a large multi-story parking garage (at a rate of $7 per day as of 2015[update]).[145] The Harvard bus tunnel, under Harvard Square, connects to the Red Line underground. This tunnel was originally opened for streetcars in 1912 and served trackless trolleys (trolleybuses) and buses as the routes were converted; four lines of the MBTA trolleybus system continue to use it. The tunnel was partially reconfigured when the Red Line was extended to Alewife in the early 1980s. Besides the state-owned transit agency, the city is also served by the Charles River Transportation Management Agency (CRTMA) shuttles which are supported by some of the largest companies operating in the city, in addition to the municipal government itself.[146] Cycling[edit] Cambridge has several bike paths, including one along the Charles River,[147] and the Linear Park connecting the Minuteman Bikeway at Alewife with the Somerville Community Path. A connection to Watertown is under construction. Bike parking is common and there are bike lanes on many streets, although concerns have been expressed regarding the suitability of many of the lanes. On several central MIT streets, bike lanes transfer onto the sidewalk. Cambridge bans cycling on certain sections of sidewalk where pedestrian traffic is heavy.[148] While Bicycling Magazine in 2006 rated Boston as one of the worst cities in the nation for bicycling,[149] it has given Cambridge honorable mention as one of the best[150] and was called by the magazine ""Boston's Great Hope"". Boston has since then followed the example of Cambridge and made considerable efforts to improve bicycling safety and convenience.[151] Cambridge has an official bicycle committee.[152] The LivableStreets Alliance, headquartered in Cambridge, is an advocacy group for bicyclists, pedestrians, and walkable neighborhoods.[153] Walking[edit] The Weeks Bridge provides a pedestrian-only connection between Boston's Allston-Brighton neighborhood and Cambridge over the Charles River. Walking is a popular activity in Cambridge. In 2000, among US cities with more than 100,000 residents, Cambridge had the highest percentage of commuters who walked to work.[154] Cambridge's major historic squares have changed into modern walking neighborhoods, including traffic calming features based on the needs of pedestrians rather than of motorists.[155] Intercity[edit] The Boston intercity bus and train stations at South Station, Boston, and Logan International Airport in East Boston, are accessible by subway. The Fitchburg Line rail service from Porter Square connects to some western suburbs. Since October 2010, there has also been intercity bus service between Alewife Station (Cambridge) and New York City.[156] Police department[edit] Main article: Cambridge Police Department (Massachusetts) In addition to the Cambridge Police Department, the city is patrolled by the Fifth (Brighton) Barracks of Troop H of the Massachusetts State Police.[157] Owing, however, to proximity, the city also practices functional cooperation with the Fourth (Boston) Barracks of Troop H, as well.[158] The campuses of Harvard and MIT are patrolled by the Harvard University Police Department and MIT Police Department, respectively. Fire department[edit] Engine 2, Paramedic Squad 2, Ladder 3 firehouse The city of Cambridge is protected by the Cambridge Fire Department. Established in 1832, the CFD operates eight engine companies, four ladder companies, one rescue company, and two paramedic squad companies from eight fire stations located throughout the city. The Acting Chief is Gerard Mahoney.[159] Emergency medical services (EMS)[edit] The city of Cambridge receives emergency medical services from PRO EMS, a privately contracted ambulance service.[160] Public library services[edit] Main article: Cambridge Public Library Further educational services are provided at the Cambridge Public Library. The large modern main building was built in 2009, and connects to the restored 1888 Richardson Romanesque building. It was founded as the private Cambridge Athenaeum in 1849 and was acquired by the city in 1858, and became the Dana Library. The 1888 building was a donation of Frederick H. Rindge. Sister cities and twin towns[edit] See also: List of twin towns and sister cities in the United States Cambridge's sister cities with active relationships are:[161] Coimbra, Portugal (1982) Gaeta, Italy (1982) Tsukuba, Japan (1983) San José Las Flores, El Salvador (1987) Yerevan, Armenia (1987) Galway, Ireland (1997) Les Cayes, Haiti (2014) Cambridge has ten additional inactive sister city relationships:[161] Dublin, Ireland (1983) Ischia, Italy (1984) Catania, Italy (1987) Kraków, Poland (1989) Florence, Italy (1992) Santo Domingo Oeste, Dominican Republic (2003) Southwark, England (2004) Yuseong (Daejeon), Korea (2005) Haidian (Beijing), China (2005) Cienfuegos, Cuba (2005) Notes[edit] ^ Brighton was annexed by Boston in 1874. ^ Part of West Cambridge joined the new town of Belmont in 1859; the rest of West Cambridge was renamed Arlington in 1867. ^ The name of today's nearby Sheraton Commander Hotel refers to that event.

Save Bees and Farmers ! Our biodiversity is at risk as never before. That is why the European Commission set a target in the ""Green Deal"" to reduce the use of pesticides by 50%. The pesticide industry, their allies in the European Parliament and national governments are attacking this historic target. Never before has it been so important for EU citizens to raise their voices against the use of pesticides. Demand the phase-out of pesticides now! Sign the European Citizens' Initiative ""Save bees and farmers""! Menu Our key demands European Citizens’ Initiative “Save Bees and Farmers!” A phase-out of the use of synthetic pesticides By 2030 the use of synthetic pesticides shall be gradually reduced by 80 percent in EU agriculture. By 2035, agriculture in the entire Union shall be working without synthetic pesticides. Measures to recover biodiversity Habitats shall be restored and agricultural areas shall become a vector of biodiversity recovery. Support for farmers Farmers must be supported in the necessary transition towards agroecology. Small, diverse and sustainable farms shall be favoured, organic farming expanded, and research into pesticide-free and GMO-free agriculture will be supported. Campaign News 29/03/2021 Italian ECI alliance calls on policymakers to align with EU Green Deal objectives Relaunch of the signature collection of the European Citizens' Initiative to reinforce the objectives of the EU Strategies ""Farm to Fork"" and ""Biodiversity 2030"" and ask for a coherent renewal of the National Pesticide Action Plan. 25/01/2021 ""Save Bees and Farmers"" asks for a ban of three bee-toxic substances Today, the Save Bees and Farmers ECI alliance sent a letter to Vice-President Timmermans and Commissioner Kyriakides as well as to the ministers of agriculture in EU countries to demand a ban on three bee-toxic pesticides (sulfoxaflor, benfluralin and cypermethrin). 10/12/2020 EU-Pesticide reduction targets under attack by EU Member States The goals to protect biodiversity set in the European Green Deal are facing strong political headwinds. This has recently become apparent in negotiations on the Common European Agricultural Policy (CAP) as Member States decided not to link agricultural subsidies to the reduction of pesticide use. … More News Get active Share the initiative FacebookTwitterWhatsApp Support us with a donation Donate here Distribute signature forms and leaflets Find materials A dead-end system European agriculture is reaching a dead end. Agricultural policies that were one-sidedly geared towards increasing yields by increasing the use of toxic agrochemicals have brought the ecosystem to the brink of collapse. Day by day, the biological diversity that underpins our food systems is disappearing – putting the future of our food, livelihoods, health and environment under severe threat. The consequences for nature are disastrous: bees, butterflies and other insects are vanishing from our landscapes and previously widespread birds have stopped singing in our fields. Our streams and rivers are being polluted and we are exposed to a daily cocktail of synthetic pesticides through our food. Read more FAQ Frequently asked questions Why do I have to provide so much personal information? A European Citizens' Initiative is different from a ""normal"" petition: it is an official democratic instrument that enables EU citizens to help shape Europe by asking the European Commission to propose a legislative act. If we manage to collect one million (validated) signatures, the EU Commission will be legally obliged to deal with our demands. We have no control over what data is required for the signing of a European Citizens' Initiative by the member states. The respective EU member states determine which data must be collected, so that the signatures are valid and counted. For this reason, in an ECI it is necessary to give more personal data than you are used to from other ""petitions"". However, all data collected in ""Step 2"" of our action will not be passed on to us - instead, it is forwarded directly to a secure server located in Germany, using a specially certified software (OpenECI), so that the responsible national authorities can verify the validity of your vote. This is necessary because an ECI is an official EU instrument, so whether the signatures actually come from citizens of an EU member state has to be checked. Your personal data will be permanently deleted after official verification by the national authorities.  We would be pleased if you could complete step 2 of our action on the basis of these explanations. Only then you will have signed the ECI and your signature can be counted. How can I support the European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI) as a private person or organisation/association? There are many possibilities. You can support the ECI: by signing the the ECI now on this website. by telling your family, friends and colleagues about our ECI and its goals. This is very important since we will only achieve the necessary system change if a sufficiently large amount of people  recognise the urgency of the current crisis and the dire need for rapid action to counter it. by sharing our content on social media. You can also print out signature forms, collect signatures from relatives and send the signed forms to us by post (you will find the address on the forms). by supporting the work of ""Save Bees and Farmers"" with a donation. Why didn't I receive a confirmation e-mail when I signed the ECI? Your data will of course be transmitted securely and encrypted. All data collected -when signing the ECI in ""Step 2"" - with the software certified by the European Commission (OpenECI) goes directly to a secure server. It will not be sent to us and for this reason it is not possible to send you a confirmation of your participation. Only the competent national authorities can inspect the votes for random verification of their validity. This is necessary because an ECI is an official EU instrument. Your personal data will be permanently deleted after official verification by the national authorities. I'm not sure I've signed the ECI yet. Can I sign a second time or is my signature invalidated? Yes, sign again if you're unsure. Your signature is valid and is counted only once. The software automatically detects double signatures and sorts out duplicates. I am a national of one EU member state but living in another EU member state. In which member state do I sign? In the case of the online signature: in the “please select country” box write your nationality the widget will be configured to ask you the specific requirements for that nationality (whatever the country you live in is: Address, ID, etc...). in the “nationality” box, put your nationality again in most cases, you will have to fill in your address. There you choose the EU country you live in If this does not work, the only solution is: print the signature form of the country you are a national from: Here you can find the signature forms to print at home fill in your personal data sent it back to the address written on the signature form Depending on the data required by these member states, you may have the possibility to choose between signing for your nationality or your living country, bearing in mind that you can sign up only once for the initiative “Save Bees and Farmers”. The data which you provide in your signature will determine in which member state your signature will be counted. Example: An Austrian living in Estonia can either ... ... fill in the form for Estonia, providing his/her full first names, family names, address, date and place of birth and nationality - in this case, his/her signature will be verified and therefore counted in Estonia ... or fill in the form for Austria, providing in addition to the above data a personal identification document number from the list accepted by Austria – in this case, his/her signature will be verified and therefore counted in Austria. I am EU citizen resident outside of the EU. Can I sign the ECI? This depends on the member state of which you are national. Depending on the requirements asked by the member states, you may or may not be able to sign up online. This is due to the fact that some member states require an EU address. For those who will have the possibility to sign up, your vote will be counted in your member state of nationality. For those who cannot sign online, then you can print the paper form, fill it in with your nationality and address and send it back. Why such a radical approach? Are 15 years not far too short a period of time to switch to an agriculture without synthetic pesticides? When a farmer decides to become a certified organic farmer, it takes three years in order for his land and harvests to receive the organic label, meaning no synthetic pesticide was used throughout the production process. Such a transformation is knowledge-intensive and requires  training and adaptation on the farmer’s side. We therefore consider that 15 years is a sufficient period of time to train farmers to adopt pesticide-free practices. 15 years would allow for a smooth transition period but with clear objectives. Furthermore, we have already gambled away the opportunity for less ambitious changes and for a slower agricultural conversion. As early as 2008, the International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development (IAASTD), initiated by the World Bank, urgently warned in its final report (PDF document): ""Business as usual is not an option (PDF document)“. But the IAASTD‘s warning was not followed by corresponding action. As a result, ten valuable years for the transformation of agriculture were lost until the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) in May 2019 presented its Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, which strongly reiterated the warning that ""business as usual is not an option“. A few months later, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) presented its report on the link between land use and greenhouse gas emissions. Both UN bodies, IPBES and IPCC, warned urgently that the window of opportunity for taking measures to avert the imminent collapse of the world's climate and ecosystems would be closing very soon. Since past decision-makers did not “hear” the message and failed to act, we simply cannot wait any longer. Our generation is the last to still have the power to take effective action to halt biodiversity loss and climate change. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,  if we do not act now,  we  risk passing the point of no return in ten years' time. Is the collapse of biodiversity caused exclusively by pesticides? Indeed, there are many factors that contribute to species‘ extinction. The Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) 2019 report has made this clear. The main causes mentioned are namely land use change, pollution, climate change and the proliferation of invasive species, where land use change and related air, water and soil pollution are caused by agriculture, forestry and urbanisation, with 71% of the total land available being used for agriculture and forestry. The use of synthetic pesticides is a two-fold driver of species‘ extinction: an immediate harmful effect of pesticide use results from pesticides‘ toxicity to insects, birds, amphibians, as well as soil and aquatic organisms. In addition, pesticides have enabled a model of intensive farming that heavily relies on intensive monocultures which leave no room for the existence of species diversity (agrobiodiversity). In other words, the continuous intensification of chemical pest control since the 1960s has made the use and consideration of natural biological mechanisms for pest control - such as the provision of habitats and ecological niches for beneficial insects, or the use of resistant crop varieties - seem obsolete, while the provisions listed above are key to pesticide-free agriculture. In order to restore these natural ecosystems and to enable species diversity in agricultural land, it is indispensable to implement pesticide-free practices in our agricultural system. Fortunately, evidence shows that biodiversity recovery can happen relatively quickly when measures are taken to restore habitats in parallel to abandoning the use of synthetic pesticides. So will we have to plough with horses again in the future and weed fields by hand? No, this image is very often raised by the pesticide industry to frighten farmers and citizens. The fact that a future biodiversity-compatible agriculture can do without synthetic pesticides does not mean that it should not take advantage of the incredible amount of scientific knowledge and technological innovations that are available today. As the International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development (IAASTD) report already stated in 2008, the decisive factor in combating hunger globally is not the maximisation of productivity, but the availability of food and its means of production locally. The best guarantees for this are smallholder structures with their ecological and social benefits (PDF document). Recent technological developments, such as the switch from heavy machines to light, energy-autonomous, self-driving agricultural robots, are promising. Such technological advances could, for example, enable mechanical weed monitoring to ensure a controlled balance between crops and other plants, thus maintaining an ecological diversity of beneficial insects to contain pests within the crop. Do you believe that farmers support the idea of banning pesticides? Contrary to messages by the pesticide industry or spokespersons from major farmers‘ unions, there is a wide diversity of thought among the farming community. While large farmer associations have so far persistently defended the agro-industrial system and consistently combated pesticide restrictions, a growing number of smaller interest groups and farmers see dependence on the agro-industry (synthetic pesticides, seeds and fertilizers producers) and its products as a driving force behind the crisis into which farms and the ecosystem have fallen. For us organisers of the citizens' initiative, it will therefore be decisive whether we succeed in showing the prospects for change and convincing farmers not only that agriculture without pesticides is possible, but also that in the long term it is the best option. We therefore want to use the coming year not only to collect signatures for our citizens' initiative but also to enter into dialogue with farmers and their representative bodies. But won't food prices in Europe become more expensive if farmers are forced to make use of alternative crop protection measures? The highest price we can ever pay for our food is the devastation of our livelihoods and the livelihoods of our children and grandchildren. But it is precisely this price that we are currently paying worldwide when we buy unsustainably produced, cheap food. Our current way of farming threatens the world's food supply, as the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) stated in a comprehensive report on the state of agriculture and biodiversity (PDF document) in February 2019. The reason why we still buy food at this low price is that the real price does not appear at the supermarket checkout. We pay it through burning forests, polluting water, eroding soil, contaminating the air we breath and finding chemical residues in our food. Pesticides, as well as low-quality food, have important health impacts that involve important societal costs (cancers, Parkinson diseases, reproductive impairment, etc). We must therefore put an end to this disastrous system. Farmers that produce food sustainably  should be rewarded, while imported food produced with synthetic pesticides should be heavily taxed. Furthermore, farmers generally do not earn a decent living in the EU despite the fact they are caring for producing the food that is at the very  basis of our health. Decision-makers shall ensure that farmers earn decent revenues, while maintaining food at affordable prices. Why do the central demands of the citizens' initiative only include a ban on the use of pesticides in the EU but not a ban on imports of goods produced using pesticides? In fact, that is one of our demands! In the Annex to our ECI (PDF document, 92.3 KB) we state that accompanying measures are necessary to ensure that pesticide-free food produced in Europe does not become subject to competition from cheap food from third countries produced using pesticides. This can be guaranteed in a diversity of ways, either by a general ban on food that is not certified as produced without synthetic pesticides, or even a correspondingly high taxation and/or the subsidisation of European products that have been produced in a biodiversity-friendly way. It is clear that such measures are indispensable for the protection of European agriculture.  At the same time, it is to be expected that such a trade policy can send out positive steering effects for a system change in other parts of the world. However, as this affects international trade agreements, and these cannot be subject to ECIs, this demand is (only) listed in the ECI Annex, and therefore does not formally belong to its central demands. But one thing is clear to us: we will all have to deal with this political question, because transformation can only happen if unfair competition from products that do not meet similar ecological standards can be excluded. Without pesticides, how can we ensure the nutrition of over nine billion people? An answer to the question of how to feed a world population that will have grown to a projected 9 billion by 2050 was provided about ten years ago by the International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development (IAASTD). Its key recommendations included improving agro-ecological and low-input farming methods (PDF document), plant breeding for better climate, temperature and pest resistance, as well as compensation for environmental services and reducing dependency on fossil fuels. What you will not find in the report, however, are recommendations to use pesticides in order to secure the world's food supply. On the contrary, the IAASTD recommends the replacement of agrochemicals by biocontrol. The claim that pesticides are necessary to secure the world's food supply is therefore nothing more than the narrative of large agrochemical groups, which earn billions of euros from the sale of pesticides. There is no scientific evidence to support such claim, it is just a myth. How are farmers supposed to make the transition to pesticide-free production in 15 years? Over the last decades, the development of organic farming and the implementation of agroecology has clearly proven that farming without pesticides is a very real option. It is knowledge-intensive and requires adaptation from farmers. It is important to advise and support farmers in their transition. To achieve this, the necessary economic framework conditions must be created. In some cases,  further research on agro-ecological methods must also be promoted through public resources released by the renunciation of investments in agrichemicals. Over the past decades, billions of euros of public and private funds have been invested in the development, manufacturing and regulation of synthetic pesticides and in countering the negative environmental and health effects they have caused. In the future, public resources ought to fund research in agroecology to improve production while respecting the environment. Research results must then quickly reach farmers and help them to improve their practices. Can we afford the ""luxury"" of not using pesticides at all in view of the upcoming challenges posed by climate change? In view of climate change, abandoning the agricultural model based on intensive agrochemicals use is key for the future of our production. Climate change will confront agriculture with unprecedented weather extremes and increased pest pressure. It is precisely in view of these challenges that it is all the more important to ensure the necessary resilience through agroecosystems that are as strong and resilient as possible with a corresponding species diversity. For instance, agroecological production methods are less susceptible to droughts as soils with high rates of carbon store more water. They also support humus formation in the soil and remove CO2 from the atmosphere. This is particularly important because in order to meet the IPCC's 1.5 degree target, it will be necessary for CO2 emissions from food production to become negative worldwide. This means more CO2 from the atmosphere going into the soil and contributing to humus formation, than is emitted in total by agricultural processes (this performance could be compensated, for example, by remuneration). Will genetic engineering help to eliminate pesticides? The United Nations’ IAASTD report already stated that (PDF document) „green genetic engineering“ has so far created more problems than solutions and has one-sidedly directed research interest towards patentable products. The vast majority of GMO varieties that are sold today are either resistant to a pesticide, and thus lead to more pesticide use in the field, or they are genetically modified to produce pesticides themselves and thus put ecosystems in danger! Our citizens' initiative for the protection of biodiversity and smallholder farms explicitly calls for the promotion of independent, rural training and research in the field of pesticide- and GM-free agriculture. It is undisputed, therefore, that the breeding and selection of seeds should be promoted and expanded using conventional breeding techniques. Who we are We are a wide alliance of NGOs, agricultural initiatives, grassroots movements, beekeeping associations and scientists. Our aim is to obtain a paradigm shift in European agriculture, so that it becomes a model that meets the needs of the environment, farmers and citizens alike. Together, we want to collect at least a million signatures for the  European Citizens’ Initiative “Save bees and farmers!”. The initiative is coordinated by the organisations listed below. Members of the Circle of Organizers: Aurelia Foundation (Germany) BUND (Germany) European Professional Beekeepers Association (EU) Friends of the Earth Europe (EU) Générations Futures (France) Global 2000 (Austria) Pesticide Action Network Europe (EU) Slow Food (EU) Umweltinstitut München (Germany) More information about our alliance List of the alliance partner organisations service navigationContactPressImprintPrivacy Policy Our website uses cookies to improve the usability and performance of our services and to track visits.

Together with our partners around the world, Health Care Without Harm shares a vision of a health care sector that does no harm, and instead promotes the health of people and the environment.To that end, we are working to implement ecologically sound and healthy alternatives to health care practices that pollute the environment and contribute to disease.For example, the incineration of medical waste is a leading source of dangerous air pollutants such as dioxin and mercury, and the use of hazardous chemicals indoors may contribute to the high rates of asthma among health care workers. The huge scale of the health care sector worldwide means that unhealthy practices — such as poor waste management, use of toxic chemicals, unhealthy food choices and reliance on polluting technologies — have a major negative impact on the health of humans and the environment.The good news is that the health care sector can play a leading role in solving these problems. Due to its massive buying power, and its mission-driven interest in preventing disease, the health care sector can help shift the entire economy toward sustainable, safer products and practices.Health Care Without Harm is at the center of this work to transform the health sector worldwide, without compromising patient safety or care, so that it becomes ecologically sustainable and a leading advocate for environmental health and justice.

However, Nigeria still remains largely food insecure as shown in the 2019 Global Food Security Index which places Nigeria 96th out of 113 countries examined.To meet the demands posed by the food security threat highlighted above, HEDA has identified key thematic areas in which our strength and capabilities allow us to make changes. They include;Policy AdvocacyPolicies provide guidelines for governance and enables the public to measure the achievements of governments.  Ending poverty and hunger can only be achieved when the policy environment addresses the factors that cause the problem. HEDA therefore advocates that the government at all levels must uphold the Maputo declaration by ensuring that 10% of the yearly budget is allocated to agriculture. Furthermore, the government should make policies that benefit small scale farmers especially women and youth. Policies that ensure a climate resilient agricultural system must be made and implemented.Farmers Education and Citizen AwarenessIncreasing citizens awareness is critical to solving the problems our campaign targets; this is because when citizens take ownership of the issue, they can mount the necessary pressure needed to force the government to act favourably. On the other hand, the farmers need to be educated on how to engage government and private sector stakeholders in order to attain food security and better livelihoods. The farmers are also educated on best farming practices and the business of farming i.e agropreneurship.Farmers Livelihood Enhancement HEDA organises activities that aim to enhance the livelihoods of farmers through resource and market support. An example is the Ire Akrai Fish Feed Mill which provided a semi-automated feed mill for the fish farmers in the Abute Afuye community of Epe, Lagos. We also increase the capacity of the farmers in order to improve their productivity and hence increase their income through trainings and resource support.Private Sector HEDA works as a mediator between the private sector and farmers to ensure a mutually beneficial relationship is developed.

Adoke currently stands trial in Italy over his alleged role in the OPL 245 ""Malabu Scandal"" case and a related money laundering trial at the Federal High Court in Abuja - over allegations of forgery in a document that was admitted in court as evidence in Italy in the ongoing corruption case. There is absolutely no reasonable ground for his arrest and detention as the act also depicts an undemocratic and military-junta-styled imposition of ""guilty until proven innocent"" by law enforcement. Although Suraju has been released, CODE believes that this is an overt attempt of subterfuge to misdirect the public, and frustrate prosecutorial efforts and the course of justice in the controversial OPL 245 ""Malabu” Scandal. CODE hereby urges the Nigeria Police Force and law enforcement authorities to cease and desist being a willing and nefarious tool(s) in the hands of Political Exposed Persons (PEPs) and work towards holding PEPs and alleged criminal elements to the highest standards of accountability in the pursuit of justice for the Nigerian state and people. https://www.premiumtimesng.com/…/455379… See MoreArigbabu Sulaimon OlawaleMarch 21 at 2:35 AMOk, na who sabi dis guy?

(August 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) AbbreviationHBSFormation1997TypePublic policy think tank The Heinrich Böll Foundation (German: Heinrich-Böll-Stiftung e.V., HBS) is a German, legally independent political foundation. Affiliated with the German Green Party,[1][2] it was founded in 1997 when three predecessors merged. The foundation was named after German writer Heinrich Böll (1917–1985).[3][4] Contents 1 Mission statement and structure 2 History 3 Fields of activity 4 Organisation 4.1 Headquarters and offices in Germany 4.2 International offices 4.2.1 The Washington, DC office 4.3 Scholarship programme 4.4 Gunda Werner Institute 4.5 Research archives 4.6 GreenCampus 5 Awards 6 Selected publications 6.1 Books 6.2 Series / magazines 7 See also 8 References 9 External links Mission statement and structure[edit] Headquarters of the Heinrich Böll Foundation in Berlin The Heinrich Böll Foundation is part of the global Green political movement that has developed since the 1980s. It describes itself as an agency for green visions and projects, a think tank for policy reforms, and an international network.[5] In its mission statement the foundation defines its aims as follows: The Heinrich Böll Foundation is part of the Green political movement that has developed worldwide as a response to the traditional politics of socialism, liberalism, and conservatism. Our main tenets are ecology and sustainability, democracy and human rights, self-determination and justice. We place particular emphasis on gender democracy, meaning social emancipation and equal rights for women and men. We are also committed to equal rights for cultural and ethnic minorities and to the societal and political participation of immigrants. Finally, we promote non-violence and proactive peace policies.[6] With the approval of the Böll family and Bündnis 90/Die Grünen (the German Green Party), the foundation carries the name of the writer Heinrich Böll. According to its mission statement, Böll personified what the foundation stands for: The courage to stand up for one's beliefs; inspiring people to meddle in public affairs; and unconditional support of human dignity and human rights.[6] Böll encouraged others to be politically active and get involved in political matters, famously stating: ""Meddling is the only way to stay relevant.""[7][8] The Heinrich Böll Foundation also has a scholarship programme for university and PhD students,[9] as well as a research archive with a focus on new social movements, Green politics, and a special section for political activist Petra Kelly.[10] The foundation, with headquarters in Berlin, operates 30 offices on four continents and has branches in each of Germany's 16 states. Since 2002, Ralf Fücks and Barbara Unmüßig have led the executive board; Steffen Heizmann is the current CEO.[11] In November 2016 Barbara Unmüßig was re-elected and Ellen Ueberschär was elected to succeed Ralf Fücks in July 2017.[12] The German state did subsidize the work of the foundation with 63 Million Euros in 2018.[13] History[edit] Heinrich Böll Foundation headquarters, entrance In what was then West Germany, state-level foundations affiliated to the Green Party were set up in the early 1980s. In 1983, an effort to create a national foundation came to nothing, yet later in the 1980s three different nationwide foundations were established, reflecting the different political strands within this rainbow coalition. They were the feminist Frauenanstiftung, the Buntstift federation of regional foundations, and the Cologne-based Heinrich Böll Foundation. Later, an umbrella organisation, Regenbogen, was created whose task it was to co-ordinate the activities of the three separate foundations.[14] In 1988, the Green Party recognised Regenbogen as the foundation allied to the party thus making it eligible for government funding.[3][15] In March 1996, a Green Party convention demanded that the separate foundations become one and the motion was passed with a large majority.[16] The statutes drafted for this new unified foundation defined gender democracy and issues related to migration and diversity as key fields of activity. After some further debate, the new foundation took the name of one of its predecessors – Heinrich Böll Foundation. On 1 July 1997, the newly founded Heinrich Böll Foundation began its operations at headquarters located in Berlin's Hackesche Höfe.[17] In 2008 the foundation moved to its current headquarters in Berlin's government district. The new, energy-efficient building was designed by Zurich-based e2a eckert eckert architekten and its design inspired by two Mies van der Rohe projects, Farnsworth House and the Seagram Building.[18][19] Fields of activity[edit] The Heinrich Böll Foundation works on a range of issues, some long-term, some short-term. The following areas figure large in many of its projects and publications: Climate Change: The foundation focuses on the concept of Greenhouse Development Rights (GDRs), arguing that the impasse between the climate crisis on the one hand and development on the other has to be overcome by making the protection of ""development dignity"" part of the climate protection agenda.[20] Recent publications in this field include the Coal Atlas that focuses on the environmental and health impacts of coal mining and use.[21] Resource Policy: The foundation advocates a responsible use of resources and accordingly advises governments, political actors, and interest groups in Germany and abroad. An example for this is the memorandum Resource Politics for a Fair Future.[22] In 2014, a widely reviewed publication titled The Meat Atlas presented a wide range of data demonstrating that the present amount of international meat consumption is unsustainable.[23][24][25] European Policy: The foundation supports the democratic reform of European institutions and is committed to a further expansion of the European Union and the integration of new member states.[26][27] Gender Policy and LGBTI Rights: From its very beginning, gender politics and gender democracy have been priorities for the foundation, and its organisational development, which is based on gender equity, has become a template for many other institutions. The foundation's work on LGBTI rights has garnered national as well as international attention.[28][29][30] Scholarship Programmes: The foundation awards scholarships to outstanding students in Germany, be they German citizens, EU nationals, or from other parts of the world. It encourages the integration of non-German students into the programme. In addition, there are specific programmes for journalists, as well as sur-place-scholarship programmes in Russia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia and in Central America and the Caribbean.[9][31] Organisation[edit] Headquarters and offices in Germany[edit] The foundation's present headquarters (since 2008) in the centre of Berlin provide approximately 7,000 square metres of floor space with modern offices for ca. 185 employees. The conference centre seats up to 300 people in varying configurations, making it possible to hold large multi-day conferences. The foundation claims that its headquarters are in the ""ecological vanguard"" of modern office and conference centre design. At 55.7 kWh/m2 the building's energy consumption is less than half the legal maximum. In partnership with Grammer Solar,[32] a photovoltaic system has been installed on the roof. This has an annual energy yield of some 53,000 kWh and feeds into the district heating system. In addition, the building uses an adiabatic recooler to climatise its offices. Outlet slits run at sill level along the glazing in every office. The sill casing houses high-performance heat-exchangers, through which water at a temperature of 20 °C circulates in the summer. A small ventilator inside ensures that cooled air is distributed throughout the room. Even when the temperature outside is over 30 °C, the room temperature does not rise above 25°. This system uses approximately ten times less energy than a conventional air conditioning system. The building uses the heat created by the computer network servers to heat its rooms. In recognition of this innovative project that significantly improves the energy efficiency of IT systems the foundation was presented with the Green CIO Award.[33] Lastly, the atrium and internal courtyard create natural convection currents that serve to ventilate the building all year long.[34] The Heinrich Böll Foundation has regional offices in each of Germany's 16 states. These regional offices, which are organised as independent, associated units, implement community and regional programmes to do with ecology, democracy, migration, and gender democracy. Such activities, however, are not limited to regional or national issues and some co-operation projects are international in scope. Although legally independent, all 16 offices are part of the foundation's overall structure and are bound by the statutes of the Heinrich Böll Foundation (e.g. they have to serve the public interest and have to meet the quota for female employees).[35] International offices[edit] International offices of the Heinrich Böll Foundation City Country, Region Continent active Cape Town South Africa, Southern Africa Africa 1997– Nairobi Kenya, East Africa/Horn of Africa Africa 1997– Abuja Nigeria Africa 1995– Addis Ababa Ethiopia, Horn of Africa Africa 2006–2012 Tunis Tunisia, North Africa Africa 2012– Rabat Morocco, Northern Africa Africa 2014– Tel Aviv Israel, Middle East Asia 1998– Ramallah Palestine, Middle East Asia 1999– Beirut Lebanon, Middle East Asia 2004– Kabul Afghanistan Asia 2006– Islamabad Pakistan Asia 1993– New Delhi India Asia 2001– Beijing China Asia 2006– Phnom Penh Cambodia Asia 1994– Bangkok Thailand, Southeast Asia Asia 1999– Yangon Myanmar, Southeast Asia Asia 2015– Rio de Janeiro Brazil South America 2000– Santiago de Chile Chile, Cono Sur South America 2008– Mexico City Mexico Central America 2004– San Salvador El Salvador Central America 1995– Washington, D.C.

Projects overseen by individual offices are frequently not limited to the country where an office is located as many have regional responsibilities. Overall the foundation conducts and supports over 100 projects in 60+ countries.[36] Even before 1997, when the current Heinrich Böll Foundation was created, some of its predecessors operated international offices, which were then absorbed into the new foundation. The very first office was the one in Prague, which opened its doors in August 1990.[37] The second one was, in 1993, the Pakistan office,[38] followed in 1994 by Turkey and Cambodia, and by Russia, Nigeria, and the Central America office in El Salvador (all in 1995). Over the course of the years, the only office that has been closed is the one in Ethiopia. According to the foundation it discontinued its activities there in 2012, as the conditions dictated by the Ethiopian government ""in April 2012 confirmed that independent political work would not be possible (...) and the Heinrich Böll Foundation would remain extremely restricted in its activities. (...) Under these circumstances, the Ethiopian office of the Heinrich Böll Foundation cannot, in the foreseeable future, fulfil its mission of promoting democratisation, gender justice and sustainable development. (...) The closure of the Foundation's office in Ethiopia should therefore also be taken as a sign of protest against the ongoing restriction of human rights and democratic development in the country.""[39] In early 2013, the head of the foundation's Afghanistan office was recalled for security reasons. Office activities continue however with the support of local staff. International offices are, as a rule, headed by a German citizen posted to the country in question. They are supported by local staff and, in some cases, by additional German experts. Well-known office heads include Milan Horácek (Prague) and Kerstin Müller (Tel Aviv). The Washington, DC office[edit] Bastian Hermisson, Executive Director of the Heinrich Böll Foundation North America, moderates with Annette Maennel, Head of the Communications Department in Berlin. In 1998, the Heinrich Böll Foundation opened its office in Washington, D.C. The office focuses on five programme areas: climate & energy, foreign & security policy, democracy & society, economic governance & G20, and gender. Through organising events and inviting international visitors, the office promotes the exchange of ideas and concepts between North America and the rest of the world.[40] These five areas encompass the following: Climate & Energy: The Foundation publishes and organises events on (gender-) equitable sustainable economic development, tackling climate change, and clean energy solutions. Within these subject areas, special attention goes to social and gender justice, participatory democracy, and citizen involvement.[41] Foreign & Security Policy: Within this policy area, the focus is on threats to global peace and security, which have become increasingly transnational in nature. They include the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, asymmetrical conflicts, and the results of climate change in the form of resource scarcity and forced migration.[42] Democracy & Society: The Transatlantic Dialogue Program on Democracy and Social Policy explores the challenges to US and European democracies. How do developments such as the rise of right-wing populist parties across Europe, the wide-spread appeal of anti-immigrant rhetoric in the US, a global refugee crisis, and the growth of new digital technologies impact our societies and test the strength of our democracies? In this policy area, the Foundation brings together policymakers and civil society organizations through events and publications to discuss how to respond to such challenges in order to promote a strong transatlantic partnership and inclusive democratic societies.[43] Economic Governance & G20: The Economic Governance Program focuses on democratizing governance structures to ensure that international financial institutions and bodies, such as the G20 and BRICS, are representative and accountable. It also works on democratizing policy-making in thematic areas (e.g., finance, economics and trade) and sectoral areas (e.g., infrastructure) to strengthen ""real economies"" in ways that respect the rights of the earth, vulnerable groups, and women. The Foundation supports the engagement of citizens' groups in developing countries in both areas, including through public education and capacity-building.[44] Gender: Gender democracy, a concept that addresses the structural and societal causes of the inequality between sexes, is a cross-cutting theme for all Foundation activities. By striving to inject gender awareness and perspectives in international political processes and institutions, the Heinrich Böll Foundation continuously promotes such an understanding of gender equality.[45] Scholarship programme[edit] In addition to its political and cultural work, the Heinrich Böll Foundation also offers scholarships for university and PhD students. Scholarships are available for all academic disciplines, with around 1000 scholarships per year. The candidates selected are expected to achieve a high degree of academic excellence, serve their communities, be interested in politics and social issues, and support the ideals the foundation stands for.[46] In its Annual Report the foundation states: In 2013, the Foundation's Scholarship Program selected 310 new fellows from a pool of 1,999 applicants. Last year, a total of 852 undergraduate and graduate students as well as 235 doctoral candidates received financial support (57% women, 43% men). 1,002 of these scholarships were financed by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research; of this group, 312 fellows (31%) had an immigrant background and 394 (39%) came from families with no academic background. In addition, funding from the Federal Foreign Office paid for scholarships for 85 international fellows; of this group, 22 fellows (26%) were from other European countries and 63 (74%) from non-European countries.[47] In addition to the scholarship programme for students at German universities, the Heinrich-Böll-Foundation also offers three sur-place-scholarship programmes for non-German undergraduate and postgraduate students in Russia, the Southern Caucasus region (Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia), and in Central America and the Caribbean. Funding for these programmes comes from the Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development and the German Foreign Office.[48] Gunda Werner Institute[edit] The Gunda Werner Institute[49] for feminism and gender democracy was created in 2007 when the foundation's Feminist Institute and Joint Taskforce for Gender Democracy merged. The Institute focuses on women's rights as human rights, the politicisation of gender issues, the reflection of feminism and gender democratic approaches, and the discourse between science, politics, and civil society.[50] Through conferences and publications the institute's programmes address issues such as the nexus between human security and women's security;[51] the evolving role of UN Resolution 1325 on ""women, peace and security"";[52] gender-political aspects of transitional justice in post-conflict societies;[53] debates surrounding gender and science;[54] and issues to do with sexual and reproductive rights.[55] Research archives[edit] The Heinrich Böll Foundation operates two archives in Berlin, the Archiv Grünes Gedächtnis (Green Memory Archive) and the Petra Kelly Archive; in addition, it supports the Cologne-based Heinrich Böll Archive. Grünes Gedächtnis collects documents about the history of the German Green Party and the new social movements in Germany, including materials concerning West Germany's environmental, anti-nuclear, feminist, and peace movements after 1968, as well as East Germany's civil-rights movement. In addition to official documents of political parties and documents donated by activists or their estate, the archive has a substantial collection of campaign posters, photographs, web content, and voice and video recordings.[56] The Petra Kelly Archive collects and preserves the political legacy of activist and politician Petra Kelly, including materials concerning international movements against nuclear weapons and for disarmament, peace, human rights, and emancipation.[57] The Heinrich Böll Archive collects and documents everything to do with the life and works of German Nobel laureate in literature Heinrich Böll. In collaboration with the Historical Archive of the City of Cologne and members of the estate of Heinrich Böll it collects and indexes all works of Heinrich Böll as well as publications about him. Since 2002, the archive has been one of the co-editors of the critical edition of the works of Heinrich Böll.[58][59] GreenCampus[edit] GreenCampus[60] is the Heinrich Böll Foundation's academy for political training and continuing education. Founded in 2006, the academy offers training in political management and on diversity and gender issues for volunteers and political activists as well as professional organisers and politicians. Awards[edit] The Heinrich Böll Foundation sponsors a number of awards, among them the Petra Kelly Prize (biannual) The Petra Kelly Prize is awarded since 1998 to people and civil society organisations for their exceptional commitment to human rights, non-violent conflict resolution, and the environment. The prize is endowed with €10,000.[61] Awardees include the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO), Ingrid Betancourt, Wangari Maathai, and Zhang Sizhi.[62] the Hannah Arendt Award (annual) Since 1995 the Hannah Arendt Award, named after Hannah Arendt, goes to individuals who uncover and analyse important, yet largely overlooked aspects of current political developments and who engage in public debate. The award is endowed with €10,000[63] and funded by the government of the state of Bremen and the Heinrich Böll Foundation Bremen.[64] Awardees include Ágnes Heller, François Furet, Massimo Cacciari, Michael Ignatieff, Julia Kristeva, Tony Judt, Timothy D. Snyder,[65] and Roger Berkowitz.[66] the Peace Film Prize (each year as part of the Berlin Film Festival) Since 1986 the Peace Film Prize is part of the Berlin Film Festival – and the only peace award that is part of one of the major film festivals. The price is endowed with €5000 and the awardee is also presented with a bronze created by Otmar Alt.[67] Awardees include Marcel Ophüls for Hôtel Terminus: The Life and Times of Klaus Barbie, Michael Winterbottom for In This World, and Bille August for Goodbye Bafana.[68] the Anne Klein Women's Award (annual) The Anne Klein Women's Award was created in 2012 im memory of feminist lawyer and politician Anne Klein (1950–2011) and is funded thanks to a generous gift provided by Anne Klein in her will. The award goes to women whose outstanding commitment has helped make gender democracy a reality and who have fought against gender-based discrimination and anti-gay resentments.[69] As an example, the 2017 Anne Klein's Women's Award went to South African activist Nomarussia Bonase who, with the Khulumani support group, is campaigning for reparations for over 100,000 victims of apartheid.[70] Selected publications[edit] Books[edit] Soil Atlas: Facts and figures about earth, land and fields. Published in 2015 in collaboration with the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies, the Soil Atlas traces the interrelations between our growing demand for food and the depletion of soils.[71] Julie-Anne Richards, Keely Boom: Big Oil, Coal and Gas Producers Paying for their Climate Damage. This book, published in collaboration with the Climate Justice Programme (CJP) proposes a new way to finance climate change adaptation – a tax on fossil fuel extraction that will have to be paid by the top 90 polluters who are responsible for two-thirds of all carbon emissions.[72] Ina Praetorius: The Care-Centered Economy. Rediscovering what has been taken for granted.[73] The Meat Atlas is an annual report on meat consumption and the meat industry published in co-operation with BUND, Friends of the Earth and Le Monde diplomatique.[74] Series / magazines[edit] Perspectives Africa[75] Perspectives Asia[76] Perspectives Middle East[77] Perspectives Southeastern Europe[78] Perspectives Turkey[79] See also[edit] Konrad Adenauer Foundation (CDU) Friedrich Ebert Foundation (SPD) Friedrich Naumann Foundation für die Freiheit (FDP) Hanns Seidel Foundation (CSU) Rosa Luxemburg Foundation (Die Linke) Desiderius-Erasmus-Stiftung (AfD) References[edit] ^ ""Who we are and what we do.

Key research areas at the Centre for Coastal Research are the regional climate in Northern Germany as well as its adjacent seas, the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. In this region storms, especially wind velocities, swells and storm surges, play an important role and are of immediate economic and environmental importance. Constant monitoring and evaluation are key factors for an effective management of the coastal areas. Currently, the Centre is developing the Coast Observatory COSYNA (Coastal Observation System for Northern and Arctic Seas). COSYNA will substantially improve the monitoring of algal blooms and sand movements in coastal waters. Furthermore, the COSYNA project will develop forecast models and scenarios, which will provide crucial information for the future management of coastal areas.

The Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht, Centre for Materials and Coastal Research, is robustly engaged in sustainable development. Research conducted at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht is meant for practical usage, either now or in the future, and is always conducted with the future world and future generations in mind. The centre is part of an expansive network of German research institutes, called the ‘Helmholtz Association’. The research centre’s motto clearly reflects its mission - “Science creates benefits” - which in turn reflects its core research areas: Key technologies: including the creation of “Advanced Engineering Materials” such as lightweight materials for cars and aeroplanes or innovative biomaterials for medical applications; The Earth and the Environment: coastal researchers study the coast in Northern Germany and the Baltic, looking for the effects of climate change and of human impacts; Photons and neutrons: the centre provides an infrastructure for complementary research into photons and neutrons. The Centre’s research facilities are located in Geesthacht near Hamburg and Teltow near Berlin. Short summary of the visit at HZG in Geesthacht on 01. November 2013 Approximately 30 km southeast of Hamburg on the banks of the river Elbe you find the city of Geesthacht which is well-known as the location of the Krümmel Nuclear Power Plant. With the governmental decision of a nuclear phase-out this plant was shut down and is therefore symbolic for the national goal of the realization of a sustainable energy supply, the “Energiewende”. This effort is mainly driven by research and development as it is conducted in many universities but also in non-university research facilities like the Helmholtz-Centre for Materials and Coastal Research (HZG). The facility is part of Germany’s largest scientific organization: the Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres. At the HZG more than 900 employees are working on high-performance materials for the cars and aircrafts of tomorrow, environmental-friendly technologies, new materials for medical application, research on future climate change and management of the coastal and marine ecosystem. Due to the wide spectrum of scientific topics at HZG the visit was offering insights into various research fields related to sustainable development. Dr. Joachim Krohn, Deputy Science Director of HZG, personally welcomed the Green Talents to the Centre before they visited the different sections. The start was made by Prof. Thomas Klassen giving a vivid presentation about hydrogen technology and storage for a more sustainable mobility in the future. The participants even got the chance to sit in a functioning hydrogen racing car. This was followed by presentations of each of the three HZG institutes based in Geesthacht. Dr. Torsten Brinkmann from the Institute for Polymer Research demonstrated implementation possibilities for membranes while the topic of Sustainable Development in Coastal Areas which is related to the Institute for Coastal Research was introduced by Dr. Götz Flöser. And last but not least the group had the chance to be guided through the Magnesium Innovations Centre that gave an impressive overview of the diverse possibilities for applications of magnesium-based materials. At the end of the day the group had a comprehensive insight into the research of the HZG and what it is like to work for one of Germany’s large non-university research facilities.

Helvetas is an independent organization for development based in Switzerland with affiliated organizations in Germany and the United States. Helvetas supports poor and disadvantaged women, men and communities in about thirty developing and transition countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe. Together with our partners Helvetas tackles the global challenges at various levels: with projects on the ground, with expert advice and by advocating for conducive framework conditions benefiting the poor. This triple commitment is empowering people and transforming lives. Helvetas follows a multi-stakeholder approach by linking civil society actors, governments and private sector. Helvetas is active in five working areas: water, food and climate, education, jobs and private sector development, governance, gender and social equity. Helvetas engages in emergency relief, reconstruction and rehabilitation. In addition to rural areas, Helvetas is increasingly involved in urban development and is focusing its work on young women and men. In Switzerland, Helvetas promotes solidarity and participates in the dialogue on development policy. Our vision Our vision is of a just world in which all men and women determine the course of their lives in dignity and security, using environmental resources in a sustainable manner. Our mission We support poor and disadvantaged women, men and communities in developing and transition countries in their efforts to improve their living conditions. Through development cooperation, we support women and men in improving their livelihoods themselves in a sustainable manner. We promote equitable access to the resources and services necessary for life and thus contribute to overcoming the root causes of poverty. We uphold the protection and promotion of social, economic, political, environmental and cultural rights and responsibilities, and seek to ensure their practical implementation. We support our partners in engaging in development policy issues. We advocate for a coherent Swiss foreign and economic policy, responsive to the needs of men and women in developing and transition countries. We accompany and support our partners on a long-term basis. Our fundamental values Our engagement is based on solidarity and partnership. We work towards achieving human rights and upholding the principle of self-determined development. We are committed to social equity and strive for equal opportunities for men and women regardless of age, origin, language, religion, culture or political convictions. Our collaboration with our partners is based on mutual respect for cultural values and principles. We stand for development that balances economic viability, environmental appropriateness and social benefits. «For the first time in human history, overcoming poverty as a destiny is within reach. Faced with growing inequalities, we must unite forces to create pathways into a self-determinded life for today’s global youth.» Melchior Lengsfeld, Executive Director of Helvetas Our working principles We work in partnership, on the basis of shared values, and strengthen the autonomy of our partners. We strive for innovation and sustainability in our programmes. We actively engage in development policy dialogue seeking to influence international regulatory frameworks towards being more just and responsive to the demands of developing countries.

We are deeply concerned that since 1 Feb 2021, 550 civilians have been killed, including 46 children.1 This violence escalated even further on Saturday, 27 March, when at least 114 people were killed in a single day. Over the same weekend, airstrikes were launched by the Myanmar military in Kayin/Karen State, killing civilians and forcing around 10,000 people to flee their homes. These horrific acts of violence must stop immediately. We are deeply concerned by the dire humanitarian consequences of this crisis. Obstacles to access vital health services for those injured, or persons with chronic disease, increase the risk of long term impairment, and represent a further challenge for Covid-19 response. The occupation of education and healthcare facilities across the country undermines the right to education and health. We renew our call on armed forces and police to refrain from all forms of violence against civilians, peaceful protestors, journalists, and media workers and to respect the fundamental human rights of all people in Myanmar, including freedom of peaceful assembly, freedom of speech, and free flow of information. We remain committed to working with our civil society partners and supporting communities with urgently needed assistance to meet their immediate basic needs and with programmes that build greater resilience over the longer term. The political crisis is creating new vulnerabilities, increased humanitarian needs and deepening poverty across the country. The lives, livelihoods and rights of civilians must be protected. We urgently call for all stakeholders to use all possible diplomatic channels, forums and means to: ● Ensure civilians are protected from indiscriminate violence, and provide refuge and protection to those fleeing for safety, in line with international law ● Respect and facilitate unimpeded access to humanitarian assistance for communities in need across Myanmar ● Urgently find a peaceful solution to this crisis, together with the people of Myanmar.
