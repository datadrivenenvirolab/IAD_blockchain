Peer exchange is not a training programme but usually consists of one community visiting another, seeking to experience how that grassroots organization approaches their work and to share their perspectives on development. Peer exchange means sharing collective, unique talents and experiences with others. This volume draws on almost 15 years of experience of the Huairou Commission. This organization was established in 1995 as a global coalition of networks, institutions and individual professionals that links grassroots women’s community development organizations to partners for access to resources, information sharing and political spaces. The Huairou Commission focuses on sustaining grassroots women’s leadership in redeveloping families, homes, communities and economies in crisis situations; local governance and asset-securing approaches that anchor grassroots women’s participation; and collaborative partnerships that strengthen and upscale grassroots local knowledge and advance alternative development policies. It has initiatives around topics of governance, community response and resilience, AIDS, land and housing, and peace building in several parts of the world. The handbook describes the five elements that are core for peer exchange: • Place: collective learning takes place in the spaces where hosts normally do their work, because these spaces are reflections of their norms and values. • Participatory learning methods: peer exchange is not a conference where attendees passively sit and listen, but an experience that encourages the participation of women in the learning. • Collective learning: facilitators and organizers should structure dialogue sessions in order to share experiences. • Co-learning: interaction is based on anyone’s responsibility to share their learning and support others’ understanding. • Evaluation and dissemination: groups involved begin to create a collective history together. The point of every peer exchange is that it serves as a guide for future experiences. Therefore, appraising the experience and figuring out how to share what was learned with other grassroots groups are essential means of marking trail as they go, making it easy for those who may choose a similar path in the future. This handbook covers various practical topics, including the responsibilities of a host committee and the preparation of arrangements; searching for potential partners and funders; planning the programme; creating a budget; logistics; planning evaluation and monitoring; and managing the programme. Several examples, experiences and illustrations are included.

LEARN MOREPartners Take a look at our countless programmatic partners, funders, sponsors and supporters. TAKE A LOOKOpportunities Check out our latest calls for artists, volunteering, internship, and job opportunities! JOIN NOWWe believe our environment is not separate from our society, and that healthy communities, stable economies, and social equity cannot exist without environmental well-being. We go beyond doling out information in hope that people will change. Instead, we inspire people to transform their behavior by making issues personal to their lives. SUPPORT USOur target audience is you. Whether you’re a seasoned environmentalist, a newcomer to the movement, senior citizen, politician, corporate executive, community organizer, student, or none of these things, you have a stake in the health and functioning of our environment, and you play an important role in your community.  Anyone can make a positive human impact, and everyone benefits from collective action. Our job is to help you take part in your own personal way. OUR STORY We know there’s a gap between knowing, understanding, and taking action. Our solution to closing this gap is simple: We help people of diverse ages and backgrounds personally connect to the most pressing environmental issues of our times, and give them the tools needed to take positive, long-term actions. HELP US DO MORETogether, we: INSPIRE new audiences to engage in social and environmental solutions through our Creative Communication programs ACT and help you take action, while broadening your knowledge through our Learning-by-Doing programs SHARE innovative ways to stay involved and build a community of change-makers through our Curated Actions programs We are social entrepreneurs who create and share innovative approaches to tackling social and environmental issues. Our programs pair artists and scientists to engage new audiences in climate change solutions, bring youth to the boardroom, and get policy makers’ hands dirty as they care for local street trees. We are action-oriented, and our passion is to help people make a difference, in their own unique way. WHO WE ARE WHAT WE DO HOW WE DO IT WHY WE DO IT WHO WE DO IT FOR To me, one of the biggest mistakes we’ve made in the environmental movement has been to talk about “saving our planet” as opposed to “living healthy, happy lives”. Most of us would put having healthy, happy loved ones as #1 on our priority lists. However, we’ve created an unnatural divide between nature and humans, environment and society. In order to really think about the “state of the environment”, the first step is to look at the “state of our environment”—from the trash on the street corner to the rates of asthma in our kids and the amount of cancer in our communities. What type of world do you want? Personally, I want my apple to be affordable and free of hazardous toxins; I want access to clean drinking water and I want communities in Brazil to have it too; I want city kids to know that ketchup is made from tomatoes that grow in dirt and country kids to know that good public transportation can mean an incredible amount of freedom. I would love every American, and every global citizen, to ask two questions: Are you proud of your human impacts? And, whether you are or not, what actions will you take to support strong communities and a healthy environment? In 2010, I realized I was growing as an educator, artist, and environmentalist, but that I could have only so much of an impact as one individual. I started to think of how I could connect these components of my life to create a community dedicated to education, creativity, direct action, big policy, and the environment. I concluded that by building an organization, I could foster exactly this “big picture” approach. In 2011, the Human Impacts Institute was born. Since then, our amazing Crew has grown with experts in transforming ideas into action, while inspiring countless communities to take part—from city kids connecting with life in their waterways to diplomats exploring creative ways to communicate climate change. When you feel connected to something—whether it’s a global issue like climate change or a local one like caring for your neighborhood park—taking action to improve or protect it becomes fulfilling and meaningful. Oftentimes, it is the arts that give us a way to express ourselves or show a personal connection to tough topics. The Human Impacts Institute is a place to help you do just that. My goal was, and still is, to make the environment something personal and close to you, instead of “outside” or “over there”. I’m amazed and humbled by how far we’ve come and thank you for joining us on this amazing ride. We look forward to working with you as agents of positive change in our communities. With thanks, Tara DePorte Founder and Executive Director SUPPORT HII TODAY!A Message from our Founder Annual Reports 2018201620152017201420132012 2011 WHAT PEOPLE SAY Testimonials ""Not only is it so exciting to be putting all that waste to some semi-good use (at least by recycling it) but it is really something that the whole school: students, teachers, and parents can get involved with. You were full of amazing ideas and your presence at our first meeting totally got the ball rolling in the direction of something attainable instead of something simply overwhelming. Thank you."" —Catherine B., Parent and Teacher, On working with HII Crew ""It was a great experience.  I really valued my time spent working on curriculum for Hii and writing grant proposals. The leaders were very well prepared.  All the other interns were inspirational and friendly. [The Human Impacts Institute Internship Program] has made me more comfortable teaching environmental education classes.  I will continue to teach environmental education ,especially street tree stewardship.  I will also continue to use my grant writing skills."" —Melissa M., Undergraduate Student, HII Environmental Education Intern “The Human Impacts Institute is a supportive, friendly, and creative group. [The internship] was an eye opening experience.  I got a better idea of how I want to use my skills, experience and future graduate degree to support marine habitats. My experience with the Hii program illuminated my strengths and weaknesses in terms of writing, understanding policy and understanding the way a non-profit operates.  I am looking for a role for myself in the environmental field and the Hii program was a great introduction.” —Jennifer K., Mid-career Professional, HII Climate and Coalition Building Intern ""[The workshop was] fun and well organized.  I liked working with the students, too. They [Human Impacts Institute staff] were prepared.  I thought there illustrations were good too.  They had the right tools for us to work with as well."" —Lauren Z., Corporate Volunteer, HII Education Participant ""Since the inception of our partnership, we have come to know the Human Impacts Institute as an important growing force in the field of environmental leadership development. Through your programming our students have learned about environmental advocacy and tree stewardship. Through your work in our community internationally crucial issues are being addressed in educational settings. Our partnership has truly improved our learning environment and is an enrichment to students and staff."" —Karali P., Principal, The Green School, NYC ""As opposed to the other work experiences I have had, Hii was especially significant. I feel like I got real-world, hands-on experience. I also feel like my small efforts will go a long way. We were able to teach people, while being taught at the same time, which is awesome. I also learned many things from my manager, Tara, that will stay with me for my social and professional life. I feel like I am more aware of sustainable practices as well as the things I can do to help implement them in the world. Not only that, I feel a greater passion for what was being taught more than ever before."" —Ron C., Undergraduate Student, HII Sustainable Business Intern ""Getting the chance to spend a day at the United Nations was an experience I will never forget ! To my knowledge, not many people get the chance to sit in on an actual UN conference. It was kind of surreal that history could happening in this very building and I was there to witness it !  The Human Impacts Institute and and UN CSD -Youth Caucus were awesome! I really feel like I learned a lot about team work on that day. I will bring all those skills I have learned back to my LIFTT [Leadership Institute for Today and Tomorrow] group and hopefully in everything else I do in life!"" —Allison O., High School Student, HII Education Participant DONATEBECOME A MEMBERThe Human Impacts Institute is a 501(c)3 charitable organization EIN# 45-2589652  |   Our policies  |   © 2021Human Impacts Institute Offices 240 Division Avenue Brooklyn, NY 11211 ​ Mailing Address 312 South 3rd St., #7 Brooklyn, NY 11211 USA Info@HumanImpactsInstitute.org +1 917 727 9761","Human Impacts Institute, Inc."

The 2030 Agenda recognizes that inclusive and participative economies, and societies in which government is accountable, achieve better outcomes for all people, leaving no one behind. The Declaration on the Right to Development emphasizes the right of all individuals and peoples to free, active and meaningful participation. And the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) set out the duty of States and private companies to ensure that business activities do not abuse people’s rights. Civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights and the right to development build on each other and advance together. No matter how free individuals are to speak out and protest, they are not truly free if they lack food, education or adequate housing. The reverse is also true. Societies in which people have access to fundamental social protections, and economic resources and opportunities, are less vulnerable to social fracture and the spread of extremism.Despite this, economic policies in many countries have curtailed social protection and concentrated wealth and political power in fewer and fewer hands. Unsustainable, wasteful growth patterns increase environmental degradation and accelerate climate change, generating effects that harm health, access to water and sanitation, food, housing and land rights, and endanger life. The poorest, who contribute least to climate change, pay the highest price.Over the period 2018-2021, together with our partners, we will work so that: Judicial and non-judicial mechanisms hold business and other economic actors to account for rights abuses and provide remedies to victims.We will provide technical support, guidance and advocacy to increase the effectiveness of judicial and non-judicial accountability mechanisms and policies to address human rights abuses arising from economic activity, including in cross border cases; clarify legal options and identify practical measures to improve access to remedy for victims of human rights abuses that involve businesses and other economic actors, including in the technology and finance sectors; and strategically engage with business and other economic actors to enhance accountability and access to remedy. Business actors implement the UN guiding principles on business and human rights effectively.We will work strategically with States, businesses, civil society and other key stakeholders to apply and integrate the UNGPs in national, regional and international legal and policy frameworks relevant to business and other economic actors, and in company practice. We will advocate, support, convene and participate in multi-stakeholder and inter-governmental processes to develop and strengthen standards and policies in this area, and enter into strategic partnerships where appropriate with business and other actors to enhance implementation of the UNGPs. State authorities adopt and implement laws, policies and strategies on land andhousing that increasingly comply with human rights.We will strengthen efforts to support authorities to integrate human rights standards when they draft and implement laws, policies and strategies on land and housing; assist accountability mechanisms to address forced evictions, homelessness, displacement, land grabs and other violations of housing, land and related rights such as food, water and sanitation; strengthen partnerships to increase awareness of the right to housing and land rights; and develop practical approaches to implement the SDG commitment to ‘leave no one behind’ with respect to housing, land and related human rights. Public health approaches, including sexual and reproductive health policies, comply with international human rights standards and provide non-discriminatory access, especially to children, adolescents, women and migrants.We will work to deepen understanding of the impact of discrimination on health rights, including by monitoring health care settings, and provide technical advice on the right to health of people who are marginalized or face discrimination. We will seek to increase awareness among health workers of their role as human rights defenders and protect those who defend and promote human rights, including sexual and reproductive rights. We will promote and support protection of health-related human rights during efforts to prevent or respond to conflicts, epidemics, natural disasters and other crises, and assist humanitarian actors to apply a rights-based approach to health in those situations. Environmental and climate policies and plans increasingly respect, protect and fulfil human rights, guaranteeing those affected access to information, decision-making, public participation and remedies.We will collaborate with partners to integrate human rights in environmental laws and policies; and press for the inclusion of civil society in environmental decision-making processes, access to information, and effective remedies for victims. We will assist human rights mechanisms to address environmental issues; advocate on behalf of environment defenders and support efforts by the UN system to protect them; and conduct research and advocacy to address human rights harms caused by environmental degradation, particularly to groups in vulnerable situations. Human rights assessments and impact analyses mitigate, prevent or redress the negative effects of economic, trade and development policies and projects.We will encourage and assist States and partners to apply human rights assessments and impact analysis to trade and investment policies, environmental and social risk management, and development finance.We will help to create and maintain safeguard policies and independent accountability mechanisms for development financing institutions and will support populations affected by them. We will continue to provide technical support to human rights mechanisms on methodologies, including for the drafting of the Guiding Principles for Human Rights Impact Assessments of Economic Reform Policies. States integrate human rights, including the right to development and human rights mechanisms’ outcomes, as they implement the sustainable development goals and other development and poverty eradication efforts; and the UN supports them in these purposes, integrating human rights in its own development work.We will encourage and support governments, national human rights institutions and civil society to integrate human rights, including the right to development, when they implement, monitor or review the SDGs or other development efforts; and advocate for the integration of human rights in SDG processes in intergovernmental fora. We will advocate for expanding civil society participation in SDG processes; document and communicate how integrating human rights in development reduces poverty and inequality; work to enhance the UN leadership’s commitment to align, and advocate for the alignment of, development policies with human rights; and buttress the human rights expertise of Resident Coordinators and UN Country Teams in this area, inter alia by operationalizing the UN framework on equality and non-discrimination. Finally, we will provide expertise and support to the Working Group and the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Development; and seek to expand support for the right to development and its integration in the SDGs and work of the UN. National institutions, assisted by communities, systematically collect, disaggregate and use data relevant for advancing human rights when they monitor and implement the sdgs.We will work to improve the capacity of national institutions to collect, analyse and disaggregate data to identify those left behind, and promote the inclusion in data collection of groups who face discrimination. We will develop legal and practical guidance on human rights-based data collection and indicators, including on ways to manage risk; and seek to improve measurement of intersecting and multiple discrimination and inequality. We will assist the international statistical system to mainstream human rights in its standards and methods, and notably in the data disaggregation frameworks that measure and report on human rights indicators as part of SDG progress reports. Work under all six pillars covers the core components of our mandate, enabling universal but strategic coverage (given resource limits) of human rights in all countries. The thematic pillars are indivisible, interdependent and mutually reinforcing. Through four major ‘Shifts’ to our approach, we will better adapt our work to the changing external context. These shifts will help us focus on key threats to rights and key opportunities for leveraging support to better protect and promote rights. The shifts we will make across our six pillars are to: Support prevention of conflict, violence and insecurity. Protect and expand civic space. Support and further develop the global constituency for human rights.Deliver human rights in the context of emerging global concerns (‘frontier issues’).These ‘Shifts’ will further unify our efforts as one Office; driving coherence, scale and measurable human rights impact in an uncertain world. Our work will be ‘people-centred’. Across everything we do, including when we focus on the human rights of other population groups, we will shine a ‘spotlight’ on the human rights of women, young people and persons with disabilities. In support of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda’s human rights-based commitment to ‘leave no one behind’, we will highlight the human rights concerns of women, young people and persons with disabilities, including as defenders of rights.

[credit: Links Media] Learn More Restoring the Monday River Forest Landscape The Forestry Oversight initiative Protect & Prosper Speeches Shim The conservation and stewardship of natural resources; reliable and affordable access to secure, modern energy services; and modern, resilient infrastructure are critical to promote sustainable growth, enhance security, and accelerate progress toward resilience and prosperity. The remarkable progress in global development is increasingly threatened by unprecedented environmental degradation, climate change, and inadequate infrastructure to sustain improvements in human welfare. Warmer temperatures, rapid urbanization, habitat loss and fragmentation, and the unsustainable use of natural resources contribute to major challenges—from pandemics to pollution—that endanger human health, economic growth, and global stability. While more than a billion people have gained access to electricity since 2010, 789 million people worldwide still lacked access as of 2018, and many more suffer from poor service quality, including frequent and long power outages. And in many developing countries, basic infrastructure is failing, insufficient, or non-existent. Sound stewardship of environmental and natural resources helps build healthier populations, strengthens livelihoods, reduces conflict, promotes stability, increases resilience, and creates lasting economic opportunities. Energy sector reforms improve energy efficiency while reducing emissions, lowering costs, spurring economic growth, and increasing access to affordable modern energy services. Improving infrastructure fosters stability and accelerates economic growth, particularly in countries recovering from conflict and disaster, allowing them to progress beyond assistance. The root causes and impacts of environmental and natural resource degradation, climate change, and pollution cut across all sectors, and the increasing intensity and complexity of these environmental challenges call for a new way of doing business at USAID—an approach that looks beyond stand-alone environment programming to enhanced integration and collaboration across the Agency. Biodiversity USAID’s global biodiversity funding supports natural systems and the people whose health and livelihoods depend on them. In fiscal year 2019, USAID worked in nearly 60 countries around the world to conserve biodiversity, leverage private sector funds, fight conservation crime, and support sustainable fisheries, all of which help partner countries build resilience and shape their futures. USAID’s comprehensive strategy to combat wildlife crime strengthens law enforcement from parks to ports, reduces consumer demand for illegal wildlife products, and strengthens international cooperation. Learn more about USAID’s work on biodiversity. Climate Change The world must halve carbon dioxide and other emissions driving climate change by 2030 to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. This requires big changes in how economies are powered, cities and buildings designed, and forests and land managed, to name but a few priority areas. At the same time, climate variability and change already affect social and economic development in multiple ways. At USAID, we integrate what we know about clean growth, natural resource management, and climate adaptation in our planning and programming. Many USAID activities—in particular, our adaptation, renewable energy, and sustainable landscapes programs—contribute to both climate change and development objectives. And through climate risk management—an internal Agency practice of assessing, addressing, and adaptively managing climate risks—USAID improves the impact and sustainability of its programming. Learn more about USAID’s work on climate change. Energy Through its established field presence, global and country-level industry networks, and long-standing relationships with government and private sector partners, USAID embraces an integrated approach to energy sector reform to reduce barriers to private investment and open clean energy markets, strengthen governing institutions, reduce air pollution and emissions, and develop resilient and financially viable power systems. Learn more about USAID’s work on energy. Natural Climate Solutions USAID advances natural climate solutions through sustainable landscapes programs that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase carbon storage from land use by promoting ambitious, systemic, natural climate solutions, including improving policies, creating incentives for sustainable stewardship, promoting sound management practices, and improving transparent land use and carbon monitoring systems. USAID forestry programs reduce illegal logging and promote improved forest conservation and management for multiple environmental and developmental goals. Learn more about USAID’s work on natural climate solutions. Infrastructure Investments in infrastructure are a core part of USAID’s work and advance our humanitarian assistance and development objectives around the world. USAID’s approach to infrastructure development is more than just bricks and mortar—it involves establishing sustainable service providers and institutions that can effectively build, operate, and maintain their critical infrastructure. USAID amplifies its infrastructure investments with capacity-building, sectoral reform, financing, innovative technology, and collaboration with the private sector. Learn more about USAID’s work on infrastructure. Land and Resource Governance Many people, businesses and communities in the developing world lack secure land and resource rights, with nearly one billion people expected to be forced out of their homes against their will in the next five years. USAID supports policies, programs, and partnerships that clarify and strengthen land rights and improve resource governance systems, with a significant focus on improving women’s land rights. USAID empowers communities with the tools and methods to map, record, and document their land and resources, including through our participatory Mobile Approaches to Secure Tenure (MAST) initiative. USAID also works to improve the governance of other resources, including minerals. Specifically, USAID works with partner countries to formalize and regulate artisanal and small-scale mining of gold; diamonds; tin, tantalum, and tungsten; and semi-precious stones. USAID programs foster artisanal and small-scale mining supply chains that are legal and environmentally and socially responsible. Learn more about USAID’s work on land and resource governance. Pollution and Green Cities Cities are hubs of global human activities. They are where 75 percent of total global resources are used and pollution is produced. USAID supports a local, community-based approach and partnerships with the private sector, government, and community organizations to reduce air pollution, improve waste management and recycling to prevent plastics from entering the ocean, identify areas adversely affected by toxic pollution, and develop solutions to mitigate those threats. Learn more about USAID’s work on pollution and green cities. Environmental and Natural Resource Management (ENRM) Framework USAID launched the ENRM Framework to coordinate, unify, and elevate environmental and natural resource management across the Agency. The ENRM Framework provides a new business model for USAID and a vision for integration that will help us work better and smarter across sectors to improve environmental outcomes, streamline field support, and align with major strategic shifts at the Agency.

It's our utmost responsibility to find such problems and face them with proper solutions. Worldwide, about 800 million people are chronically hungry, meaning that they are undernourished in terms of calories . More than 2 billion people are affected by hidden hunger, meaning that they suffer from micronutrient deficiencies. Although progress was made in reducing these problems, ending hunger in all its forms – as stated in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) – remains a global challenge . The goal of ending hunger in all its forms involves a broad definition of hunger, including calorie deficiencies (chronic hunger), micronutrient deficiencies (hidden hunger), and related health problems. Therefore, we have, hereby, framed the Constitution, 2068 of a non-governmental organization named ""Human Right and Environment Improvement Center"" with the aforementioned purpose pursuant to the Registration of Associations Act, 2034.

This effort, which includes air, waste and water issues, is known as the North Birmingham Environmental Collaboration Project.EPA Regional Administrator Heather McTeer Toney convened the Interagency Working Group on Environmental Justice (EJ IWG), to bring federal support to address the myriad of needs in North Birmingham. Since the formation of the IWG which includes local agencies and colleges, small working groups meet regularly to further define priority projects, performance measures, community goals, and identify key stakeholders to leverage or share resources.In July 2015, Region 4 hosted a series of Summer Camps in the North Birmingham, AL area. Through a partnership with the City of Birmingham, EPA staff educated the youth about the clean-up activities in the area and provided them with knowledge about healthy living.""These summer camps are an excellent way, for us as the EPA, to educate the youth on what we do as an organization and show them that what we can do together as a civilization, and how our daily activities directly impact the earth and our health,"" stated Cynthia Peurifoy, Environmental Justice Coordinator for the EPA Region 4. More than 120 children participated in the four camps.Region 4 EJ Showcase CommunityJacksonville, Florida is Region 4’s Environmental Justice Showcase Community. EPA Region 4 OEJS worked with the City of Jacksonville and numerous local stakeholders to improve environmental and public health outcomes in an area that consists of a predominantly low income and minority population. This Jacksonville area has a number of Superfund sites, Brownfields, vacant and abandoned lots or other properties where contamination is suspected and impacted waterways. Region 4 has worked with its partners, including environmental justice community representatives, to address sites of concern and turn them into an opportunity for residents in the vicinity to collaborate with developers and revitalize their neighborhoods. Read more about Jacksonville, Florida Health Zone 1.Region 4 EJ ProgrammingEJ Academy OEJS developed the Environmental Justice Academy (EJA) to educate leaders from communities facing environmental injustices. Primarily based on EPA’s Collaborative Problem-Solving Model, EJA also incorporates the concepts associated with Appreciative Inquiry (AI). AI is a change management approach to identify what is working well, analyze why it is working and take action to do more of it. Through a series of nine modules, EJA participants cultivate skills to identify environmental challenges and accomplish environmental improvement goals in their communities. Participation is open to residents as well as representatives of grassroots community organizations and academia. EJA encourages collaborative problem-solving with local government, small businesses, academic institutions and industry to create a shared vision among different stakeholders so that all parts of a community have a voice.Community Engagement University In 2016, OEJS will implement the Community Engagement University (CEU) Certificate Program to educate internal stakeholders about the complexities, challenges and rewards of working in communities. The CEU Program is designed to help staff do their work more effectively, fostering community engagement skills through a series of classroom and web-based courses that will be taught by EPA staff and consultants.Earth Tomorrow OEJS has supported the Earth for Tomorrow Summer Institute, hosted by the National Wildlife Federation, since its inception in 2001. The program engages high school students in hands-on leadership training and interaction with environmental professionals though a career fair, fieldwork and other outdoor experiences.The program focuses on creating a new generation of leaders that will promote environmental stewardship and raise awareness about the human health impacts of environmental pollution. OEJS staff has hosted an annual “EJ Day” during the Summer Institute. Last year’s EJ Day focused on the Climate Justice Movement, expanding students’ understanding of climate change impacts on vulnerable populations.Regional EJ Resources Region 4 Implementation Plan to Promote Meaningful Engagement of Overburdened Communities in Permitting Activities Environmental Justice for CAA Permitting in EPA Region 4 Regional EJ Contacts Topic Contact Phone Acting Director Shea Jones-Johnson, MS (jones-johnson.shea@epa.gov) 404-562-8206 Public Health, Tribal Coordination, Partnership for Sustainable Communities Tami Thomas-Burton (thomas-burton.tami@epa.gov), Environmental Scientist 404-562-8027 EJ Academy, Conflict Prevention and Resolution Sheryl Good (good.sheryl@epa.gov), Environmental Scientist 404-562-9559 Water Resources Management, Community Engagement University Adesuwa Erhunse (erhunse.adesuwa@epa.gov), Physical Scientist 404-562-9608 Citizen Science, Green Chemistry Deborah Ortiz (ortiz.deborah@epa.gov) Physical Scientist 404-562-8230 N/A Karen Smith (smith.karen@epa.gov), Office Assistant 404-562-9703 Photo Gallery EPA Region 5: Great Lakes Serving Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Wisconsin and 35 tribesThe Region 5 Environmental Justice program works regularly with community organizations in a variety of ways including by hosting and attending community meetings.  Region 5 has a strong relationship with co-regulators at the state and local level.   We collaborate with states on geographic initiatives and provide the states with technical support including training.Region 5 works to achieve environmental justice in its enforcement, permitting, and community-based work, as part of a comprehensive national commitment to consider environmental justice in all aspects of EPA’s decision-making process: Enforcement programs assure compliance with federal laws that protect public health and the environment, holding all facilities to an equal standard wherever they are located and focusing our attention on areas where there are potential disproportionate impacts. Permitting programs ensure that permits are issued in accordance with federal law and that surrounding communities are equally protected. In some cases Region 5 issues permits to facilities, in others they oversee state run permitting programs. They also offer training to states and promote best practices for effective public participation. Community-based work brings a full range of program resources to communities living with Environmental Justice concerns. Working with community residents and organizations, we partner with other federal, state, and local agencies to address these concerns and make a visible difference.

Region 8’s EJ Team works towards advancing environmental justice by focusing on making a difference in environmental justice communities through connecting with, supporting, building the capacity of, and leveraging resources of both internal and external partners.Region 8 is predominantly rural in character and home to some traditionally disenfranchised and historically self-reliant populations including Native Americans, migrant farm workers, Latinos, and the rural poor. These populations tend to inhabit places that are physically distant and isolated from urban centers. Indian country in the Region encompasses a large land area.The Region 8 EJ Team’s principal focus areas are to effectively integrate environmental justice into the activities of EPA Region 8, build effective partnerships with external stakeholders, and respond to challenges posed to communities impacted by oil and gas development.Learn more about Region 8.Region EJ HighlightsThe following are examples of key efforts in Region 8 that are benefitting the Region’s EJ communities: The Recycle Conejos and Costillos Counties project made possible by an EPA Collaborative Problem Solving (CPS) grant is focused on addressing illegal dumping of waste in the San Luis Valley in southern Colorado.  EPA and other stakeholders are working with the grantee to enhance cooperation and efficiency regarding waste collection and disposal and integrate, through the development of transfer stations, the illegal dumping waste stream into recycling operations. To date, most of the site identification has been completed and analysis is underway and the team has successfully coordinated with local schools with students participating in site visits to discuss illegal dumping and an illegal dump site mapping project. Through the Poplar, Montana / Fort Peck Reservation Making a Visible Difference (MVD) project, Region 8 is engaging the Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes at Fort Peck, and the town of Poplar, MT, specifically focused on a theme of sustainable living.  During summer and fall of 2015, 20 high efficiency, LEED Platinum homes are being built by the Make-It-Right Foundation and installed in the first phase of development of a new “Sustainable Village” in Poplar.  EPA is providing Brownfields technical and grant assistance to address a former landfill and airport located within the Village footprint.  EPA is also working with the Tribe and other partners to create healthy home, school, and work environments; assess and remove blighted properties and work towards a long-term plan to manage abandoned or damaged properties in the future; apply green infrastructure principles to manage storm water; and provide climate change mitigation, training, and adaption planning. EPA Region 8 is supporting efforts to assess and cleanup environmental contamination and revitalize an economically distressed and historically industrial area of Helena, Montana through the Queen City Crossing & 6th Ward Neighborhood MVD project.  Efforts include the implementation of livability/smart growth principles that will benefit residents in the 6th Ward neighborhood. The focus area contains the greatest number of brownfield sites and vacant or transitioning commercial properties in Helena. Partners are collaborating to redesign traffic flow, increase connectivity with bicycle and pedestrian access, facilitate mixed-use and equitable development and become a community-friendly gateway to the downtown area. The Denver, Colorado / Sun Valley Neighborhood MVD project focuses on implementation of the Decatur-Federal Station Area Plan (developed through a HUD Sustainable Communities Grant). As a major implementation step, the Denver Housing Authority is creating a master plan for a high density, mixed income, rental and ownership community that includes mixed-use commercial space and which explores EcoDistrict solutions for multiple sustainability issues such as energy, water management, transportation and food production. EPA Region 8 is working with various partners on redevelopment of the 33 acre public housing site including a net zero district, creating a South Platte Greenway/Riverfront Park, comprehensive storm water design, healthy homes education and industrial area cleanup.

Please introduce links to this page from related articles; try the Find link tool for suggestions. (September 2015) The Human Rights Foundation of Aotearoa New Zealand is a non-governmental organisation in New Zealand, which seeks ""to promote and defend human rights through research based education and advocacy.[1]"" The Foundation purports to do this by making submissions on bills that might involve human rights issues and investigating New Zealand's compliance with international obligations. The Foundation also takes an interest in human rights issues in the Pacific Islands.[1] The Foundation was established in December 2001[1] and was incorporated as a charitable trust on 23 October 2001 under the Charitable Trusts Act 1957.[2] Contents 1 Organisation 2 Purposes and values 3 Submissions 3.1 GCSB Bill 2013 4 Shadow reports 4.1 New Zealand's Universal Periodic Review 4.1.1 New Zealand's First Universal Periodic Review 4.1.2 New Zealand's Second Universal Periodic Review 5 Refugee issues 5.1 Ahmed Zaoui 6 Education 7 References 8 External links Organisation[edit] Members of the Foundation can either be ordinary members or Foundation (Life) Members, depending on the membership fee paid.[1] The Officers of the Human Rights Foundation are its Patron, the Chairperson, the Secretary and the Treasurer, who are all selected by an election.[3] Control of the Foundation resides with a Management Committee, consisting of the Chairperson, the Secretary, the Treasurer and up to eight committee members.[4] The Human Rights Foundation's current Chairperson is Peter Hosking, who comes from a legal background and has worked in the human rights field.[5] Hosking has been a consultant to the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and to the United Nations Development Programme.[5] He was also formerly the Proceedings Commissioner for the New Zealand Human Rights Commission.[5] Former Governor-General of New Zealand Dame Silvia Cartwright is the Patron of the Foundation.[1] Members of the Management Committee include Margaret Bedggood, who was the Chief Commissioner of the Human Rights Commission (New Zealand) from 1989-1994 (during which time the Human Rights Act 1993 was passed) and was on Amnesty International's Executive Committee from 1999-2005,[5] and Tim McBride, who wrote the New Zealand Handbook of Civil Liberties[6] and was a founding member of the Human Rights Foundation.[5] Purposes and values[edit] The Foundation’s constitution states that it was established for four key purposes. Promoting through education an understanding of the importance of internationally recognised human rights, Promoting respect for human rights principles and their widespread application, Promoting the relevance of human rights principles to economic, social, cultural, environmental and technological developments, Making knowledge about human rights widely accessible[7] At the launch of the Human Rights Foundation on 18 December 2001, Dame Silvia Cartwright stated that it was necessary for the human rights infrastructure to have ""an active civil society, to ensure grassroots participation, to hold the watchdogs accountable and to contribute a broader understanding of human rights and their implementation"".[8] She also spoke of how she had been told that the Foundation would make it a priority to ""make practical and theoretical links across human rights issues"".[8] The constitution also sets out the values upon which the Foundation operates, including respect to the Treaty of Waitangi, a concept of rights recognising both individual and group rights and the realisation of individual human potential.[9] Submissions[edit] The Human Rights Foundation has made a number of submissions on New Zealand bills. Some of their submissions are made in conjunction with other human rights organisations, such as the Equal Justice Project, which is an initiative run by University of Auckland students seeking to provide access to equal justice.[10] The Foundation's submissions have included the Human Rights Amendment Bill,[11] the Crimes of Torture Amendment Bill,[12] the Criminal Procedure (Reform and Modernisation) Bill,[13] the Immigration (Mass Arrivals) Amendment Bill 2012[14] and recently, the Government Security Bureau (GCSB) and Related Legislation Amendment Bill.[15] GCSB Bill 2013[edit] In May 2013, the Government Communications Security Bureau and Related Legislation Amendment Bill was introduced.[16] The stated purpose of the bill was to amend the Government Communications Security Bureau Act 2003, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act 1996 and the Intelligence and Security Committee Act 1996, in order to make the statutory framework around the Bureau clearer.[17] The bill amended the objectives,[18] functions,[18] powers[19] and limitations provisions.[19] The amendments gave the GCSB the authority to provide assistance to the New Zealand Defence Force, the New Zealand Police and the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service when carrying out their lawful functions.[18] The amendments also clarified when the GCSB’s powers of interception can be used. Before the amendments, the Act stated that the powers could only be used for the purpose of obtaining foreign intelligence.[19] The bill amended section 13 to say that the powers of interception could also be used for information assurance and cybersecurity.[19] The section stating that GCSB could not conduct foreign intelligence activities against New Zealanders was adjusted so that this only applies to the foreign intelligence function, not the information assurance and cybersecurity functions.[19] The bill was split into three bills, the Government Communications Security Bureau Amendment Bill, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Amendment Bill and the Intelligence and Security Committee Amendment Bill. They each had their third readings on the 21 August 2013[20] and each received Royal Assent on the 26 August 2013.[21][22][23] The Human Rights Foundation's submission on this bill, made extensive references to the individual's right to privacy.[24] They expressed concern that the monitoring of individuals would also affect the right to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association.[24] These rights are contained in both the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990[25] and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,[26] which New Zealand ratified on 28 December 1978.[27] They argued that the changes to section 14 and the insertion of new sections 15A and 15B mean that New Zealand citizens and permanent residences can be monitored in a wider range of situations. This was previously safeguarded against in the 2003 Act and the Foundation submitted that this deviation was not justified.[28] They also stated their concern that the proposed amendments to the Intelligence and Security Committee Act 1996[29] would not do enough to counter the concerns about the GCSB's compliance, as raised in a report by Secretary of the Cabinet Rebecca Kitteridge.[30] Shadow reports[edit] Part of the Human Rights Foundation's activities is producing shadow and alternative reports. These are reports that are presented alongside official reports to United Nations monitoring bodies. On 29 November 2012 the Human Rights Foundation was awarded the New Zealand Law Foundation Shadow Report Award, providing them with a $10,000 grant to assist them with this work.[31] The award was presented by the Law Foundation New Zealand Chair Warwick Deuchrass, who said on behalf of the Law Foundation ""we believe shadow reporting is a valuable contributor to the treaty monitoring process"".[31] The Human Rights Foundation plans to use the money ""to provide more in-depth reports to a wider range of UN organisations"",[31] according to Chairperson Peter Hosking. The Human Rights Foundation's shadow and alternative reports have included the following: Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD) Shadow Report June 2007[32] Convention Against Torture (CAT) Alternative Report April 2009[33] International Convention on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Alternative Report March 2010[34] Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination Shadow Report January 2013[35] New Zealand's Universal Periodic Review[edit] Main article: Universal Periodic Review of New Zealand The Universal Periodic Review (UPR) is a process through which the human rights records of United Nations member states are reviewed by the Human Rights Council. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human rights states that the aim of the process is ""to improve the human rights situation in all countries and address human rights violations wherever they occur.[36]"" Non-governmental organisations, such as the Human Rights Foundation, may prepare stakeholder reports to be considered alongside the official State report. New Zealand's First Universal Periodic Review[edit] This was considered on 7 May 2009.[37] The Human Rights Foundation and the Equal Justice Project conducted an analysis of which of the 64 resulting recommendations were and were not accepted by the New Zealand Government.[38] New Zealand's Second Universal Periodic Review[edit] For the second cycle of New Zealand's Universal Periodic Review, the Human Rights Foundation, in conjunction with Peace Movement Aotearoa,[39] produced a coordination of the reports of non-governmental organisations wanting to contribute.[40][41] New Zealand's second UPR was considered on the 27 January 2014[42] and a final outcome has not currently been released by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Information about New Zealand and the UPR process is available here[43] Refugee issues[edit] Ahmed Zaoui[edit] The Human Rights Foundation supported Ahmed Zaoui, who was granted refugee status in New Zealand by the Refugee Status Appeals Authority (RSAA) but was detained in solitary confinement due to the fact that he was issued with a National Security Risk Certificate.[44] The Human Rights foundation supported Zaoui by informing the public on the details of his case[45] and by helping to raise financial assistance towards his legal expenses.[44] Education[edit] The Human Rights Foundation has also compiled a reference text which discusses economical, social and cultural rights in New Zealand. The book, Law into Action: Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in New Zealand,[46] was edited by Kris Gledhill and Margret Bedggood, who is on the Management Committee of the Foundation.

Human Rights Watch in 1997 shared in the Nobel Peace Prize as a founding member of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines and it played a leading role in the 2008 treaty banning cluster munitions.[3] The organization's annual expenses totaled $50.6 million in 2011,[4] $69.2 million in 2014,[5] and $75.5 million in 2017.[6] Contents 1 History 2 Profile 2.1 Comparison with Amnesty International 3 Financing and services 4 Notable staff 5 Publications 6 Criticism 7 See also 8 References 9 External links History[edit] Main article: Helsinki Watch Human Rights Watch was co-founded by Robert L. Bernstein[7] and Aryeh Neier[8] as a private American NGO in 1978, under the name Helsinki Watch, to monitor the then-Soviet Union's compliance with the Helsinki Accords.[9] Helsinki Watch adopted a practice of publicly ""naming and shaming"" abusive governments through media coverage and through direct exchanges with policymakers. By shining the international spotlight on human rights violations in the Soviet Union and its European partners, Helsinki Watch says it contributed to the democratic transformations of the region in the late 1980s.[9] Americas Watch was founded in 1981 while bloody civil wars engulfed Central America. Relying on extensive on-the-ground fact-finding, Americas Watch not only addressed perceived abuses by government forces but also applied international humanitarian law to investigate and expose war crimes by rebel groups. In addition to raising its concerns in the affected countries, Americas Watch also examined the role played by foreign governments, particularly the United States government, in providing military and political support to abusive regimes. Asia Watch (1985), Africa Watch (1988) and Middle East Watch (1989) were added to what was known as ""The Watch Committees"". In 1988, all of these committees were united under one umbrella to form Human Rights Watch.[10][11] Profile[edit] This section relies too much on references to primary sources. Please improve this section by adding secondary or tertiary sources. (September 2017) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Pursuant to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), Human Rights Watch (HRW) opposes violations of what are considered basic human rights under the UDHR. This includes capital punishment and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. HRW advocates freedoms in connection with fundamental human rights, such as freedom of religion and freedom of the press. HRW seeks to achieve change by publicly pressuring governments and their policymakers to curb human rights abuses, and by convincing more powerful governments to use their influence on governments that violate human rights.[12][2] Human Rights Watch publishes research reports on violations of international human rights norms as set out by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and what it perceives to be other internationally accepted, human-rights norms. These reports are used as the basis for drawing international attention to abuses and pressuring governments and international organizations to reform. Researchers conduct fact-finding missions to investigate suspect situations also using diplomacy, staying in touch with victims, making files about public and individuals, and providing required security for them in critical situations and in a proper time generate coverage in local and international media. Issues raised by Human Rights Watch in its reports include social and gender discrimination, torture, military use of children, political corruption, abuses in criminal justice systems, and the legalization of abortion.[9] HRW has documented and reported various violations of the laws of war and international humanitarian law. Human Rights Watch also supports writers worldwide, who are being persecuted for their work and are in need of financial assistance. The Hellman/Hammett grants are financed by the estate of the playwright Lillian Hellman in funds set up in her name and that of her long-time companion, the novelist Dashiell Hammett. In addition to providing financial assistance, the Hellman/Hammett grants help raise international awareness of activists who are being silenced for speaking out in defence of human rights.[13] Nabeel Rajab helping an old woman after Bahraini police attacked a peaceful protest on 14 August 2010 Each year, Human Rights Watch presents the Human Rights Defenders Award to activists around the world who demonstrate leadership and courage in defending human rights. The award winners work closely with HRW in investigating and exposing human rights abuses.[14][15] Human Rights Watch was one of six international NGOs that founded the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers in 1998. It is also the co-chair of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, a global coalition of civil society groups that successfully lobbied to introduce the Ottawa Treaty, a treaty that prohibits the use of anti-personnel landmines. Human Rights Watch is a founding member of the International Freedom of Expression Exchange, a global network of non-governmental organizations that monitor censorship worldwide. It also co-founded the Cluster Munition Coalition, which brought about an international convention banning the weapons. HRW employs more than 275 staff—country experts, lawyers, journalists, and academics—and operates in more than 90 countries around the world. Headquartered in New York City, it has offices in Amsterdam, Beirut, Berlin, Brussels, Chicago, Geneva, Johannesburg, London, Los Angeles, Moscow, Nairobi, Seoul, Paris, San Francisco, Sydney, Tokyo, Toronto, Washington, D.C., and Zürich.[2][16] HRW maintains direct access to the majority of countries it reports on. Cuba, North Korea, Sudan, Iran, Israel, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan and Venezuela are among the handful of countries that have blocked access for HRW staff members.[17] The current executive director of HRW is Kenneth Roth, who has held the position since 1993. Roth conducted investigations on abuses in Poland after martial law was declared 1981. He later focused on Haiti, which had just emerged from the Duvalier dictatorship but continued to be plagued with problems. Roth's awareness of the importance of human rights began with stories his father had told about escaping Nazi Germany in 1938. Roth graduated from Yale Law School and Brown University.[18] Comparison with Amnesty International[edit] Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International are the only two Western-oriented international human rights organizations operating in most situations of severe oppression or abuse worldwide.[15] The major differences lie in the group's structure and methods for promoting change. Amnesty International is a mass-membership organization. Mobilization of those members is the organization's central advocacy tool. Human Rights Watch's main products are its crisis-directed research and lengthy reports, whereas Amnesty International lobbies and writes detailed reports, but also focuses on mass letter-writing campaigns, adopting individuals as ""prisoners of conscience"" and lobbying for their release. Human Rights Watch will openly lobby for specific actions for other governments to take against human rights offenders, including naming specific individuals for arrest, or for sanctions to be levied against certain countries, recently calling for punitive sanctions against the top leaders in Sudan who have overseen a killing campaign in Darfur. The group has also called for human rights activists who have been detained in Sudan to be released.[19] Its documentations of human rights abuses often include extensive analyses of the political and historical backgrounds of the conflicts concerned, some of which have been published in academic journals. AI's reports, on the other hand, tend to contain lesser analyses, and instead focus on specific abuses of rights.[20] In 2010, The Times of London wrote that HRW has ""all but eclipsed"" Amnesty International. According to The Times, instead of being supported by a mass membership, as AI is, HRW depends on wealthy donors who like to see the organization's reports make headlines. For this reason, according to The Times, HRW tends to ""concentrate too much on places that the media already cares about"", especially in disproportionate coverage of Israel.[21] Financing and services[edit] For the financial year ending June 2008, HRW reported receiving approximately US$44 million in public donations.[22] In 2009, Human Rights Watch stated that they receive almost 75% of their financial support from North America, 25% from Western Europe and less than 1% from the rest of the world.[23] According to a 2008 financial assessment, HRW reports that it does not accept any direct or indirect funding from governments and is financed through contributions from private individuals and foundations.[24] Financier and philanthropist George Soros of the Open Society Foundations announced in 2010 his intention to grant US$100 million to HRW over a period of ten years to help it expand its efforts internationally: ""to be more effective,"" he said, ""I think the organization has to be seen as more international, less an American organization."" He said, ""Human Rights Watch is one of the most effective organizations I support. Human rights underpin our greatest aspirations: they're at the heart of open societies.""[25][26][27] The donation increases Human Rights Watch's operating staff of 300 by 120 people. The donation was the largest in the organization's history.[28] Charity Navigator gave Human Rights Watch a three-star rating overall for 2018. Its financial rating increased from three stars in 2015 to the maximum four as of June 2016.[29] The Better Business Bureau said Human Rights Watch meets its standards for charity accountability.[30] Human Rights Watch published the following program and support services spending details for the financial year ending June 2011.

Human Rights Watch has reported extensively on subjects such as the Rwandan genocide of 1994,[47] Democratic Republic of the Congo[48] and US sex offender registries due to their over-breadth and application to juveniles.[49][50] In the summer of 2004, the Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Columbia University in New York became the depository institution for the Human Rights Watch Archive, an active collection that documents decades of human rights investigations around the world. The archive was transferred from its previous location at the Norlin Library at the University of Colorado, Boulder. The archive includes administrative files, public relations documents, as well as case and country files. With some exceptions for security considerations, the Columbia University community and the public have access to field notes, taped and transcribed interviews with alleged victims of human rights violations, video and audiotapes, and other materials documenting the organization's activities since its founding in 1978 as Helsinki Watch.[51] However, significant parts of the HRW archive are not open to researchers or to the public, including the records of the meetings of the board of directors, the executive committee, and the various subcommittees, limiting historians' ability to understand the organization's internal decision-making.[52] Criticism[edit] Main article: Criticism of Human Rights Watch HRW has been criticized for perceived bias by the national governments it has investigated for human rights abuses,[53][54][55] by NGO Monitor,[56] and by HRW's founder, and former Chairman, Robert L. Bernstein.[7] Bias allegations have included undue influence by United States government policy, and claims that HRW is biased against Israel (and focuses undue attention on the Arab–Israeli conflict).[57] HRW has also been criticized for poor research methodology and lax fact-checking, and ignoring the human-rights abuses of less-open regimes. HRW has routinely publicly addressed, and often denies, criticism of its reporting and findings.[58] According to Democracy Now, HRW has also been criticized for having a 'revolving door' with the U.S. government, a charge which HRW disputes.[59] In 2020, the HRW Board of Directors discovered that Human Rights Watch accepted a $470,000 donation from Saudi real estate magnate Mohamed Bin Issa Al Jaber, owner of a company HRW ""had previously identified as complicit in labor rights abuse"", under the condition that the donation not be used to support LGBT advocacy in the Middle East and North Africa. The gift was returned and Human Rights Watch issued a statement saying that accepting the funding was a ""deeply regrettable decision"" in response to investigative reporting from The Intercept regarding the donation.[60] In August 2020, HRW executive director Kenneth Roth was sanctioned—together with the heads of four other U.S.-based democracy and human rights organizations and six U.S. Republican lawmakers—by the Chinese government for supporting the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement in the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests. The leaders of the five organizations saw the sanctioning, whose details were unspecified, as a tit-for-tat measure in response to the earlier sanctioning by the U.S. of 11 Hong Kong officials. The latter step had in turn been a reaction to the enactment of the Hong Kong National Security Law at the end of June.[61] See also[edit] Politics portal Academic freedom in the Middle East American Freedom Campaign Avocats Sans Frontières Freedom House Helsinki Committee for Human Rights Human Rights First International Freedom of Expression Exchange Shia Rights Watch US Human Rights Network World Coalition Against the Death Penalty Cow vigilante violence in India References[edit] ^ ""Form 990"" (2019) ^ a b c ""Frequently Asked Questions"".

Kunchok Jinpa, 51, died in a hospital in Lhasa in the Tibetan Autonomous Region on February 6, 2021, less than three months after being transferred there from prison without his family's knowledge. Local sources said he had suffered a brain hemorrhage and was paralyzed. “Kunchok Jinpa’s death is yet another grim case of a wrongfully imprisoned Tibetan dying from mistreatment,” said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. “Chinese authorities responsible for arbitrary detention, torture or ill-treatment, and the death of people in their custody should be held accountable.” There had been no news of Kunchok Jinpa’s whereabouts since his detention in 2013. New information indicates that the authorities detained Kunchok Jinpa on November 8, 2013, providing his family no information on his whereabouts, and later convicted him of leaking state secrets for passing information to foreign media about local environmental and other protests in his region. His 21-year sentence is unparalleled for such an offense, and no information about his trial or conviction had been publicly available outside China until now. The authorities moved him from a prison – believed to be the regional prison at Nyetang [Ch.: Nidang], near Lhasa – to a hospital in that city in November 2020. His family learned on January 29 that he was to undergo emergency treatment. Several then went to give blood at the hospital, but were unable to see him. He died in the hospital on February 6. Kunchok Jinpa was a resident of Village No. 5 in Chaktse (Ch: Qiaze) township in Driru, a county in Nagchu prefecture (now municipality), about 300 kilometers north of Lhasa, the regional capital. He was one among reportedly hundreds of Tibetans from Driru detained after a series of peaceful protests in October 2013 against official demands that villagers fly Chinese flags from every house. He is believed to have provided information via social media or directly to Tibetan media outside China about a protest in May 2013 against planned mining on a sacred mountain, Naklha Dzamba, together with the names of those detained for involvement in the protest. People from his area, now in exile, reported that in his final communication on his WeChat micro-blogging account in April 2013, he wrote: “I am now at the bank of a river. There are many people behind me watching me, and I am sure to be arrested. Even if they arrest me, I am not afraid, even if they kill me, I have no regrets. But from now on, I will not be able to give reports. If there is no word from me, that means I have been arrested.” United Nations standards adopted by the UN General Assembly set out that all death-in-custody cases should be subjected to “prompt, impartial and effective investigations into the circumstances and causes” of the death. As the UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary, or arbitrary executions has noted, since there is a presumption of state responsibility due to the custodial setting, and the government’s obligation to ensure and respect the right to life, the government has to affirmatively provide evidence to rebut the presumption of state responsibility. Absent proof that it is not responsible, the government has an obligation to provide reparations to the family of the deceased. The Chinese government also has rules dealing with deaths in custody. These require the police to “immediately conduct” an investigation into the cause of death by viewing and preserving the surveillance video of the detention cell, and questioning fellow detainees, doctors, and guards, among other measures. Kunchok Jinpa, whose father’s name is Sonam Wangden and mother’s name is Pelha, had become a monk as a child at the Gom Gonsar monastery (Choekor Jampaling) in Driru. In October 1989, he traveled via Nepal to India, where he studied for about 18 months at the Changchubling monastery in Dehra Dun, the seat in exile of the Drikung Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism. From April 1991 until his graduation in 1996, he studied as a layman at a school run by the Tibetan exile community at Suja in Himachal Pradesh. He undertook further studies at the elite Higher Tibetan Studies Institute in Varanasi, and became proficient in English and Hindi, as well as Chinese and Tibetan. He returned to Tibet in about 1998 and took up work as a tour guide. According to a close associate, he was well regarded in his community for his stress on the importance of economic development and education. He made several return visits to India, including a final visit in 2012, when he attended the Kalachakra ceremony given by the exiled Tibetan leader, the Dalai Lama, in Bodh Gaya. During the crackdown by security forces on the 2013 protests in Driru, there were reports of firing on unarmed protesters, mass arrests, dozens sentenced on political charges of up to 18 years, and several deaths in custody. Human Rights Watch recently received information that more than 1,325 local people were detained at that time, of whom about 670 were eventually sentenced and imprisoned, although this cannot be confirmed. Since Kunchok Jinpa’s arrest and imprisonment, little information about the situation in Driru has been available outside China. On February 4, the exile newspaper Tibet Express, based in India, reported for the first time that another Tibetan from Driru, Namdak, about 34, from Meri village in the Tsala area, had been sentenced to 13 years in around July 2013 for assisting Tibetans trying to travel to India. Chinese authorities have not allowed Namdak any visitors for the past two years, reportedly because he is suffering from a contagious disease, and his present condition is not known. The newspaper also said that up to seven other Tibetans were given 13-year prison sentences in related cases at that time, but their names, ages, and the charges against them remain unknown. In August 2020, Lhamo, a mother of three from the same locality, died from injuries inflicted in custody there. She had been detained along with her cousin Tenzin Tharpa, apparently accused of sending money to relatives in India. A collective statement from UN human rights experts in June underlined the need for an independent investigation of the range of human rights violations by the Chinese government. They expressed grave concern over China’s failures to respect human rights and abide by its international obligations, and recommended the establishment of an impartial and independent UN mechanism to monitor and report on abuses “in view of the urgency of the situations” in Hong Kong, Xinjiang, and Tibet. “For decades Chinese officials have gotten away with detaining people without basis and mistreating them, including to near death,” Richardson said. “Those officials cannot be relied on to investigate these violations, so there is an urgent need for an independent, international investigation by UN human rights experts.” Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world. $50 $100 $250 $500 $1000 Other Donate Now Region / Country Asia , China and Tibet More Reading January 21, 2021 Report China: Tibetan Monk Dies from Beating in Custody Reports August 10, 2021 Report Underwater Human Rights Impacts of a China Belt and Road Project in Cambodia July 6, 2021 Report “Prosecute Them with Awesome Power” China’s Crackdown on Tengdro Monastery and Restrictions on Communications in Tibet More Reading January 21, 2021 Report China: Tibetan Monk Dies from Beating in Custody Most Viewed August 4, 2021 Dispatches Indian Girl’s Alleged Rape and Murder Sparks Protests August 10, 2021 News Release Cambodia: China’s ‘Belt and Road’ Dam is a Rights Disaster August 10, 2021 Report Underwater August 10, 2021 Dispatches Video Captures Vicious Homophobic Attack in Cameroon March 19, 2020 Q & A Human Rights Dimensions of COVID-19 Response Protecting Rights, Saving Lives Human Rights Watch defends the rights of people in 90 countries worldwide, spotlighting abuses and bringing perpetrators to justice Donate Now Get updates on human rights issues from around the globe.

But alongside this transformation is the Chinese government’s lack of transparency, and its reliance on censorship and propaganda. The pandemic started with Beijing withholding information from the public, underreporting cases of infection, downplaying the severity of the infection, and dismissing the likelihood of person-to-person spread. Now, the authorities have moved to detain vaccine safety advocates, censor information critical of the Chinese-made vaccines, and spread disinformation about non-Chinese vaccines. Beijing’s Covid-19 vaccine funding and development process has been shrouded in opacity. While other governments, notably the US and the European Commission, have begun publishing redacted copies of the contracts they have signed with vaccine producers, Chinese authorities have yet to take this step. More than a dozen Covid-19 vaccines developed in China are in clinical trials, with about half of them in phase 3 trials, which are large-scale studies to assess the vaccine’s level of protection. At the time of writing, only one Chinese vaccine has received emergency approval from what WHO identifies as a “stringent” regulatory authority. None of the vaccines have received full regulatory approval or released phase 3 trial data. Despite this, widespread vaccinations are being administered to the Chinese public as part of a national emergency-use protocol. As early as July 2020, Chinese authorities began to vaccinate people in “high risk” professions, including medical professionals and border workers. Some state-owned companies required their overseas-based Chinese workers to be vaccinated before they returned to their jobs abroad. Some workers expressed concerns over the lack of transparency and dearth of safety and efficacy data before the vaccine’s official approval. In recent years, recurring vaccine scandals in the country and the authorities' persistent failure to properly regulate the vaccine market have greatly frustrated the public. Some families of victims of faulty vaccines have for years demanded accountability and have been met with police harassment, intimidation, and even imprisonment. In October, the authorities in Henan province forcibly disappeared He Fangmei, an outspoken critic of Chinese vaccine companies following her daughter’s diagnosis with a neurological disease after she received vaccinations. He, who was pregnant at the time of her disappearance, has not been heard from since. In January, shortly before WHO experts arrived in China to investigate the origin of Covid-19, Shanghai authorities also forcibly disappeared Hua Xiuzhen, a vaccine safety advocate whose adult daughter developed a neurological disorder after receiving a rabies vaccine in 2014. In 2018, a court in Henan province sentenced vaccine safety activist Zhang Da’e to two years in prison for “picking quarrels and provoking trouble.” After being given a vaccine at the local government-run epidemic prevention center in Henan province, Zhang’s granddaughter was diagnosed with a brain injury and other illnesses. Though Human Rights Watch is unable to verify the causes of these illnesses, the families all believe they are a result of faulty vaccines. While there have not been publicly known cases of recipients of the Chinese Covid-19 vaccines suffering severe side effects, the authorities censored online posts raising questions about the safety of the vaccines. A person whose article on WeChat raising such questions was removed lamented on Twitter: “When writing it, I was doing my best to be deliberately vague…in order to pass the censors… As the vaccines began to be rolled out in recent days, [I] clearly felt the atmosphere becoming much more tense.” As wealthy nations have reserved most of the Western-developed vaccine doses expected to be produced this year, China has offered to fill the demand from developing countries desperate to halt the pandemic. Two major biotech companies, the state-owned Sinopharm and privately owned Sinovac, have sold abroad or received international orders for more than 800 million doses. At the same time that President Xi Jinping urged nations to “come together against global challenges” and “international cooperation on Covid vaccines,” however, Beijing has mounted an aggressive disinformation campaign inside and outside of the country to sow doubt about Western-made coronavirus vaccines. Major state media outlets including Xinhua, People’s Daily, and China Daily churned out articles about the deaths of elderly Pfizer vaccine recipients in Norway and accused Western media of downplaying the deaths, even though multiple outlets have reported on them and Norwegian authorities explained that there was no evidence linking the deaths to the vaccine. Liu Xin, a prominent Chinese state media anchor, shared an unverified report of 10 deaths in Germany, allegedly a result of receiving the Pfizer vaccine. Liu’s tweet was shared by Zhao Lijian, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry and one of the loudest nationalistic voices on Twitter, which remains banned inside China. A new report by the social media research firm Graphika also uncovered a massive, clandestine, and increasingly sophisticated pro-Beijing digital disinformation network that has been spreading vaccine propaganda on YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook. While it is difficult to attribute the network to a particular government since the platforms allow a degree of anonymity, the campaign’s timing and messaging have been closely aligned with that of Chinese state media. Beijing is playing a dangerous game. To scare people off from taking vaccines – by not disclosing data on the safety of its new vaccines and discrediting others’ vaccines – is only going to prolong the pandemic. This is something that no one, least of all Chinese authorities, should want.

Cambodian authorities and company officials improperly consulted with affected communities before the project’s start and largely ignored their concerns. Many were coerced into accepting inadequate compensation for lost property and income, provided with poor housing and services at resettlement sites, and given no training or assistance to secure new livelihoods. Other affected communities upstream and downstream of the dam received no compensation or assistance.

Built as part of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the dam, which spans well over six kilometers, has cut off vital migration routes for native fish species, and displaced numerous Indigenous and ethnic minority communities. Warnings that it would leave fishing communities worse off were ignored. Some of those who refused to resettle were threatened. Birgit Schwarz speaks with Human Rights Watch’s Asia Advocacy Director John Sifton about the devastating effect the dam has had on people’s lives, the Cambodian government’s motives for building it, and the need for Beijing to better protect the rights of those affected by its massive BRI infrastructure projects. How has the Lower Sesan 2 dam affected the region since its completion in 2018? The Mekong River Basin is an enormous freshwater ecosystem with thousands of migrating fish species. By cutting off two rivers that were major tributaries to the Mekong, and by creating a huge artificial reservoir, the dam prevents fish from traveling up and down, disrupting their feeding and reproductive cycles. As a result, whole species have died and fishery yields have plummeted. Fish is a major part of Cambodians’ diet. Millions of people on the Mekong River system live off catching and selling fish. Today, the decline in fisheries is felt all over the country. A 2008 environmental impact study that had predicted this was ignored. And local communities, who had opposed the dam from the start because they feared it would cause their income to collapse, were branded as troublemakers. They were threatened by Cambodian government officials and the Chinese state-owned power generation company responsible for building the dam. Thousands were forced to leave their homes when their fishing grounds and ancestral farming lands were flooded.

What has this meant for the river communities’ lives and livelihoods? About 4,500 to 5,000 people lived in the villages that were submerged by the dam. Many belong to Indigenous communities or ethnic minorities. Their food and income used to come from three sources. First, fish, which was their main source of protein and which they would sell to purchase necessities like nets or household goods. Second, from rice, vegetables, and fruit that they grew in the floodplains along the rivers. And third, forest products such as herbs, nuts, seeds, and tree resin. People were poor but self-sufficient. Today, everything the dammed-up rivers provided – food, water, an income from fishing – is gone. If people want to fish, they have to travel because the area they were resettled to is far from any river. The soil where they live now is rocky, dry, and difficult to farm. It requires fertilizer they don’t have money for. And because the ground water is unfit for drinking, people have to buy water. Some refused to resettle and now live on forest land to remain close to the water. But they, too, struggle to make a living. Where some families would catch 40 kilos of fish a night before the dam was built, they now don’t even catch two kilos. Large, meaty fish that can be sold for a good price have become rare. The fish that people catch today is so small, it’s often only good for making Cambodia’s traditional fermented fish dish called prahok. Fruit and rice yields have also plummeted, as the fields are no longer fertilized by silt during the rainy season. And with the forests having been submerged, the income from gathering mushrooms, medicinal plants, and nuts is completely gone. Did people receive any compensation? Communities that were compelled to accept resettlement offers were either offered pre-fabricated houses or about US$6,000 to build new homes. But the compensation that was offered did not match the value of what they actually lost: fruit trees that were decades old, villages that they and their ancestors had lived in for generations, fields, graves, and religious shrines. Nor were people offered training in new skills that would enable them to generate an income, such as welding, woodwork, or electronic repairs. What did it take to conduct the research for this report? We started doing interviews on the ground in early 2019, when the effects of the dam had become evident. Since then and due to the Covid-19 pandemic, we have been following up with regular telephone calls. Click to expand Image Former shrine in the village of Srekor, northeastern Cambodia, inundated after the completion of the Lower Sesan 2 hydroelectric dam. © 2019 Human Rights Watch But there were lots of other things we had to do in the meantime to corroborate our findings. We talked to fishery and environmental experts about hydroelectric power and greenhouse gas issues with reservoirs. We had to send water to environmental labs for testing to show that it was contaminated. We requested information from economists and the companies involved. We also had to review hundreds and hundreds of pages of environmental impact assessments to compare what had actually happened to what had been predicted. Not only environmentalists but economists, too, had opposed the dam. On what grounds? To determine the economic viability of a dam, grading systems compare its cost and the power it is expected to generate to the economic impact the additional generated electricity will have. Will it, for example, provide a reliable energy supply at lower costs? When you compare losses to fishery income and the cost of displacement caused by this dam with the gigawatt hours the dam is supposed to generate, there are serious questions about whether it was worth the costs. Plus, electricity is still in short supply and unreliable in Cambodia. Also, the country’s geography is not suited for hydroelectric power. The dam had to be so wide because the country lacks large mountains and gorges that could act as reservoirs and ensure the falling water creates sufficient pressure to power hydroelectric turbines. That in itself creates problems. When you dam up this much land, especially heavily vegetated land, all of that dead vegetation emits large amounts of carbon dioxide and methane – for years. Some hydroelectric dams – this one in particular – have carbon footprints that equal that of fossil fuel plants. Why did the Cambodian government push ahead with this dam? The dam is part of the Chinese government’s large-scale “Belt and Road Initiative” (BRI), a trillion-dollar investment and infrastructure project intended to spur development and advance Chinese foreign policy interests globally. Unlike loans from international financing institutions, Chinese government money usually comes without safeguards or obligations to protect the rights of vulnerable communities. The human and environmental costs of BRI projects have been similarly high in other parts of Asia and in Africa. The Chinese government may be providing badly needed loans for infrastructure development, but it is also setting the stage for widespread abuses to occur by failing to ensure that the companies involved acknowledge the findings of environmental and social impact assessments and adequately compensate affected communities.

Exposure of these abuses might lead the Chinese government to re-evaluate and renegotiate resettlement and compensation packages. After all, the Belt and Road Initiative is not only a development and foreign policy initiative, it is also meant to make Beijing look good on the world stage. As the majority owner of the company responsible for the construction and operation of the dam, the Huaneng Group should ensure that abuses are remedied. And going forward, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), which provided the financing for the dam’s construction, should exercise more oversight over projects it finances. Donors and international financing institutions should send a clear message that unless the concerns raised in this and other reports are addressed, the Cambodian government will struggle to get funding from them in the future. The Cambodian government itself needs to reassess how it handles impact assessments for infrastructure projects, be they a road, an electricity line, or a power plant. The authorities need to offer appropriate compensation, create programs that give people new skills, and consult with the communities about alternative mitigation strategies such as aquaculture or fish stocking opportunities for the reservoir. And lastly, Cambodia’s energy policy going forward cannot be centered around hydropower. The government will have to explore alternative energy sources.

It was designed by Shreve, Lamb & Harmon and built from 1930 to 1931. Its name is derived from ""Empire State"", the nickname of the state of New York. The building has a roof height of 1,250 feet (380 m) and stands a total of 1,454 feet (443.2 m) tall, including its antenna. The Empire State Building stood as the world's tallest building until the construction of the World Trade Center in 1970; following the latter's collapse in 2001, the Empire State Building was again the city's tallest skyscraper until 2012. As of 2020[update], the building is the seventh-tallest building in New York City, the ninth-tallest completed skyscraper in the United States, the 49th-tallest in the world, and the sixth-tallest freestanding structure in the Americas. The site of the Empire State Building, in Midtown South on the west side of Fifth Avenue between West 33rd and 34th Streets, was developed in 1893 as the Waldorf–Astoria Hotel. In 1929, Empire State Inc. acquired the site and devised plans for a skyscraper there. The design for the Empire State Building was changed fifteen times until it was ensured to be the world's tallest building. Construction started on March 17, 1930, and the building opened thirteen and a half months afterward on May 1, 1931. Despite favorable publicity related to the building's construction, because of the Great Depression and World War II, its owners did not make a profit until the early 1950s. The building's Art Deco architecture, height, and observation decks have made it a popular attraction. Around four million tourists from around the world annually visit the building's 86th- and 102nd-floor observatories; an additional indoor observatory on the 80th floor opened in 2019. The Empire State Building is an American cultural icon: it has been featured in more than 250 TV shows and movies since the film King Kong was released in 1933. The building's size has become the global standard of reference to describe the height and length of other structures. A symbol of New York City, the building has been named as one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World by the American Society of Civil Engineers. It was ranked first on the American Institute of Architects' List of America's Favorite Architecture in 2007. Additionally, the Empire State Building and its ground-floor interior were designated city landmarks by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1980, and were added to the National Register of Historic Places as a National Historic Landmark in 1986.

Visitors to the observatories use an entrance at 20 West 34th Street; prior to August 2018, visitors entered through the Fifth Avenue lobby.[1] Although physically located in South Midtown,[15] a mixed residential and commercial area,[16] the building is so large that it was assigned its own ZIP Code, 10118;[17][18] as of 2012[update], it is one of 43 buildings in New York City that have their own ZIP codes.[19][b] The areas surrounding the Empire State Building are home to other major points of interest, including Macy's at Herald Square on Sixth Avenue and 34th Street,[22] Koreatown on 32nd Street between Madison and Sixth Avenues,[22][23] Penn Station and Madison Square Garden on Seventh Avenue between 32nd and 34th Streets,[22] and the Flower District on 28th Street between Sixth and Seventh Avenues.[24] The nearest New York City Subway stations are 34th Street–Penn Station at Seventh Avenue, two blocks west; 34th Street–Herald Square, one block west; and 33rd Street at Park Avenue, two blocks east.[d] There is also a PATH station at 33rd Street and Sixth Avenue.[25] To the east of the Empire State Building is Murray Hill,[25] a neighborhood with a mix of residential, commercial, and entertainment activity.[26] The block directly to the northeast contains the B. Altman and Company Building, which houses the City University of New York's Graduate Center, while the Demarest Building is directly across Fifth Avenue to the east.[27] History The Waldorf–Astoria in 1901 The site was previously owned by John Jacob Astor of the prominent Astor family, who had owned the site since the mid-1820s.[28][29] In 1893, John Jacob Astor Sr.'s grandson William Waldorf Astor opened the Waldorf Hotel on the site;[30][31] four years later, his cousin, John Jacob Astor IV, opened the 16-story Astoria Hotel on an adjacent site.[32][30][33] The two portions of the Waldorf–Astoria hotel had 1,300 bedrooms, making it the largest hotel in the world at the time.[34] After the death of its founding proprietor, George Boldt, in early 1918, the hotel lease was purchased by Thomas Coleman du Pont.[35][36] By the 1920s, the old Waldorf–Astoria was becoming dated and the elegant social life of New York had moved much farther north than 34th Street.[37][38][39] The Astor family decided to build a replacement hotel further uptown,[30] and sold the hotel to Bethlehem Engineering Corporation in 1928 for $14–16 million.[37] The hotel closed shortly thereafter, on May 3, 1929.[32] Planning process Early plans Bethlehem Engineering Corporation originally intended to build a 25-story office building on the Waldorf–Astoria site. The company's president, Floyd De L. Brown, paid $100,000 of the $1 million down payment required to start construction on the building, with the promise that the difference would be paid later.[30] Brown borrowed $900,000 from a bank, but then defaulted on the loan.[40][41] After Brown was unable to secure additional funding,[38] the land was resold to Empire State Inc., a group of wealthy investors that included Louis G. Kaufman, Ellis P. Earle, John J. Raskob, Coleman du Pont, and Pierre S. du Pont.[40][41][42] The name came from the state nickname for New York.[43] Alfred E. Smith, a former Governor of New York and U.S. presidential candidate whose 1928 campaign had been managed by Raskob,[44] was appointed head of the company.[38][40][41] The group also purchased nearby land so they would have the 2 acres (1 ha) needed for the base, with the combined plot measuring 425 feet (130 m) wide by 200 feet (61 m) long.[45] The Empire State Inc. consortium was announced to the public in August 1929.[46][47][45] Concurrently, Smith announced the construction of an 80-story building on the site, to be taller than any other buildings in existence.[45][48] Empire State Inc. contracted William F. Lamb, of architectural firm Shreve, Lamb and Harmon, to create the building design.[2][49] Lamb produced the building drawings in just two weeks using the firm's earlier designs for the Reynolds Building in Winston-Salem, North Carolina as the basis.[43] Concurrently, Lamb's partner Richmond Shreve created ""bug diagrams"" of the project requirements.[50] The 1916 Zoning Act forced Lamb to design a structure that incorporated setbacks resulting in the lower floors being larger than the upper floors.[e] Consequently, the building was designed from the top down,[51] giving it a ""pencil""-like shape.[52] The plans were devised within a budget of $50 million and a stipulation that the building be ready for occupancy within 18 months of the start of construction.[38] Design changes Architect sketch of heights and allowed building areas The original plan of the building was 50 stories,[53] but was later increased to 60 and then 80 stories.[45] Height restrictions were placed on nearby buildings[45] to ensure that the top fifty floors of the planned 80-story, 1,000-foot-tall (300 m) building[54][55] would have unobstructed views of the city.[45] The New York Times lauded the site's proximity to mass transit, with the Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit's 34th Street station and the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad's 33rd Street terminal one block away, as well as Penn Station two blocks away and the Grand Central Terminal nine blocks away at its closest. It also praised the 3,000,000 square feet (280,000 m2) of proposed floor space near ""one of the busiest sections in the world"".[45] While plans for the Empire State Building were being finalized, an intense competition in New York for the title of ""world's tallest building"" was underway. 40 Wall Street (then the Bank of Manhattan Building) and the Chrysler Building in Manhattan both vied for this distinction and were already under construction when work began on the Empire State Building.[54] The ""Race into the Sky"", as popular media called it at the time, was representative of the country's optimism in the 1920s, fueled by the building boom in major cities.[56] The race was defined by at least five other proposals, although only the Empire State Building would survive the Wall Street Crash of 1929.[38][f] The 40 Wall Street tower was revised, in April 1929, from 840 feet (260 m) to 925 feet (282 m) making it the world's tallest.[58] The Chrysler Building added its 185-foot (56 m) steel tip to its roof in October 1929, thus bringing it to a height of 1,046 feet (319 m) and greatly exceeding the height of 40 Wall Street.[54] The Chrysler Building's developer, Walter Chrysler, realized that his tower's height would exceed the Empire State Building's as well, having instructed his architect, William Van Alen, to change the Chrysler's original roof from a stubby Romanesque dome to a narrow steel spire.[58] Raskob, wishing to have the Empire State Building be the world's tallest, reviewed the plans and had five floors added as well as a spire; however, the new floors would need to be set back because of projected wind pressure on the extension.[59] On November 18, 1929, Smith acquired a lot at 27–31 West 33rd Street, adding 75 feet (23 m) to the width of the proposed office building's site.[60][61] Two days later, Smith announced the updated plans for the skyscraper. The plans included an observation deck on the 86th-floor roof at a height of 1,050 feet (320 m), higher than the Chrysler's 71st-floor observation deck.[59][62] The 1,050-foot Empire State Building would only be 4 feet (1.2 m) taller than the Chrysler Building,[59][63][64] and Raskob was afraid that Chrysler might try to ""pull a trick like hiding a rod in the spire and then sticking it up at the last minute.""[53][65][63] The plans were revised one last time in December 1929, to include a 16-story, 200-foot (61 m) metal ""crown"" and an additional 222-foot (68 m) mooring mast intended for dirigibles. The roof height was now 1,250 feet (380 m), making it the tallest building in the world by far, even without the antenna.[66][53][67] The addition of the dirigible station meant that another floor, the now-enclosed 86th floor, would have to be built below the crown;[67] however, unlike the Chrysler's spire, the Empire State's mast would serve a practical purpose.[65] A revised plan was announced to the public in late December 1929, just before the start of construction.[38][39] The final plan was sketched within two hours, the night before the plan was supposed to be presented to the site's owners in January 1930.[38] The New York Times reported that the spire was facing some ""technical problems"", but they were ""no greater than might be expected under such a novel plan.""[68] By this time the blueprints for the building had gone through up to fifteen versions before they were approved.[53][69][70] Lamb described the other specifications he was given for the final, approved plan: The program was short enough—a fixed budget, no space more than 28 feet from window to corridor, as many stories of such space as possible, an exterior of limestone, and completion date of [May 1], 1931, which meant a year and six months from the beginning of sketches.[71][53] The contractors were Starrett Brothers and Eken, Paul and William A. Starrett and Andrew J. Eken,[72] who would later construct other New York City buildings such as Stuyvesant Town, Starrett City and Trump Tower.[73] The project was financed primarily by Raskob and Pierre du Pont,[74] while James Farley's General Builders Supply Corporation supplied the building materials.[2] John W. Bowser was the construction superintendent of the project,[75] and the structural engineer of the building was Homer G. Balcom.[49][76] The tight completion schedule necessitated the commencement of construction even though the design had yet to be finalized.[77] Construction Hotel demolition Demolition of the old Waldorf–Astoria began on October 1, 1929.[78] Stripping the building down was an arduous process, as the hotel had been constructed using more rigid material than earlier buildings had been. Furthermore, the old hotel's granite, wood chips, and ""'precious' metals such as lead, brass, and zinc"" were not in high demand resulting in issues with disposal.[79] Most of the wood was deposited into a woodpile on nearby 30th Street or was burned in a swamp elsewhere. Much of the other materials that made up the old hotel, including the granite and bronze, were dumped into the Atlantic Ocean near Sandy Hook, New Jersey.[80][81] By the time the hotel's demolition started, Raskob had secured the required funding for the construction of the building.[82] The plan was to start construction later that year but, on October 24, the New York Stock Exchange experienced the major and sudden Wall Street Crash, marking the beginning of the decade-long Great Depression. Despite the economic downturn, Raskob refused to cancel the project because of the progress that had been made up to that point.[46] Neither Raskob, who had ceased speculation in the stock market the previous year, nor Smith, who had no stock investments, suffered financially in the crash.[82] However, most of the investors were affected and as a result, in December 1929, Empire State Inc. obtained a $27.5 million loan from Metropolitan Life Insurance Company so construction could begin.[83] The stock market crash resulted in no demand for new office space; Raskob and Smith nonetheless started construction,[84] as canceling the project would have resulted in greater losses for the investors.[46] Steel structure A worker bolts beams during construction; the Chrysler Building can be seen in the background. A structural steel contract was awarded on January 12, 1930,[85] with excavation of the site beginning ten days later on January 22,[86] before the old hotel had been completely demolished.[87] Two twelve-hour shifts, consisting of 300 men each, worked continuously to dig the 55-foot (17 m) foundation.[86] Small pier holes were sunk into the ground to house the concrete footings that would support the steelwork.[88] Excavation was nearly complete by early March,[89] and construction on the building itself started on March 17,[90][2] with the builders placing the first steel columns on the completed footings before the rest of the footings had been finished.[91] Around this time, Lamb held a press conference on the building plans. He described the reflective steel panels parallel to the windows, the large-block Indiana Limestone facade that was slightly more expensive than smaller bricks, and the building's vertical lines.[66] Four colossal columns, intended for installation in the center of the building site, were delivered; they would support a combined 10,000,000 pounds (4,500,000 kg) when the building was finished.[92] The structural steel was pre-ordered and pre-fabricated in anticipation of a revision to the city's building code that would have allowed the Empire State Building's structural steel to carry 18,000 pounds per square inch (120,000 kPa), up from 16,000 pounds per square inch (110,000 kPa), thus reducing the amount of steel needed for the building. Although the 18,000-psi regulation had been safely enacted in other cities, Mayor Jimmy Walker did not sign the new codes into law until March 26, 1930, just before construction was due to commence.[90][93] The first steel framework was installed on April 1, 1930.[94] From there, construction proceeded at a rapid pace; during one stretch of 10 working days, the builders erected fourteen floors.[95][2] This was made possible through precise coordination of the building's planning, as well as the mass production of common materials such as windows and spandrels.[96] On one occasion, when a supplier could not provide timely delivery of dark Hauteville marble, Starrett switched to using Rose Famosa marble from a German quarry that was purchased specifically to provide the project with sufficient marble.[88] The scale of the project was massive, with trucks carrying ""16,000 partition tiles, 5,000 bags of cement, 450 cubic yards [340 m3] of sand and 300 bags of lime"" arriving at the construction site every day.[97] There were also cafes and concession stands on five of the incomplete floors so workers did not have to descend to the ground level to eat lunch.[3][98] Temporary water taps were also built so workers did not waste time buying water bottles from the ground level.[3][99] Additionally, carts running on a small railway system transported materials from the basement storage[3] to elevators that brought the carts to the desired floors where they would then be distributed throughout that level using another set of tracks.[97][100][98] The 57,480 short tons (51,320 long tons) of steel ordered for the project was the largest-ever single order of steel at the time, comprising more steel than was ordered for the Chrysler Building and 40 Wall Street combined.[101][102] According to historian John Tauranac, building materials were sourced from numerous, and distant, sources with ""limestone from Indiana, steel girders from Pittsburgh, cement and mortar from upper New York State, marble from Italy, France, and England, wood from northern and Pacific Coast forests, [and] hardware from New England.""[95] The facade, too, used a variety of material, most prominently Indiana limestone but also Swedish black granite, terracotta, and brick.[103] By June 20, the skyscraper's supporting steel structure had risen to the 26th floor, and by July 27, half of the steel structure had been completed.[97] Starrett Bros. and Eken endeavored to build one floor a day in order to speed up construction, a goal that they almost reached with their pace of 4+1⁄2 stories per week;[104][105] prior to this, the fastest pace of construction for a building of similar height had been 3+1⁄2 stories per week.[104] While construction progressed, the final designs for the floors were being designed from the ground up (as opposed to the general design, which had been from the roof down). Some of the levels were still undergoing final approval, with several orders placed within an hour of a plan being finalized.[104] On September 10, as steelwork was nearing completion, Smith laid the building's cornerstone during a ceremony attended by thousands. The stone contained a box with contemporary artifacts including the previous day's New York Times, a U.S. currency set containing all denominations of notes and coins minted in 1930, a history of the site and building, and photographs of the people involved in construction.[106][107] The steel structure was topped out at 1,048 feet (319 m) on September 19, twelve days ahead of schedule and 23 weeks after the start of construction.[108] Workers raised a flag atop the 86th floor to signify this milestone.[104][109] Completion and scale During construction in October 1930; the USS Los Angeles, ZMC-2 and a J-class blimp seen overhead Afterward, work on the building's interior and crowning mast commenced.[109] The mooring mast topped out on November 21, two months after the steelwork had been completed.[107][110] Meanwhile, work on the walls and interior was progressing at a quick pace, with exterior walls built up to the 75th floor by the time steelwork had been built to the 95th floor.[111] The majority of the facade was already finished by the middle of November.[3] Because of the building's height, it was deemed infeasible to have many elevators or large elevator cabins, so the builders contracted with the Otis Elevator Company to make 66 cars that could speed at 1,200 feet per minute (366 m/min), which represented the largest-ever elevator order at the time.[112] In addition to the time constraint builders had, there were also space limitations because construction materials had to be delivered quickly, and trucks needed to drop off these materials without congesting traffic. This was solved by creating a temporary driveway for the trucks between 33rd and 34th Streets, and then storing the materials in the building's first floor and basements. Concrete mixers, brick hoppers, and stone hoists inside the building ensured that materials would be able to ascend quickly and without endangering or inconveniencing the public.[111] At one point, over 200 trucks made material deliveries at the building site every day.[3] A series of relay and erection derricks, placed on platforms erected near the building, lifted the steel from the trucks below and installed the beams at the appropriate locations.[113] The Empire State Building was structurally completed on April 11, 1931, twelve days ahead of schedule and 410 days after construction commenced.[3] Al Smith shot the final rivet, which was made of solid gold.[114] Photograph of a cable worker taken by Lewis Hine The project involved more than 3,500 workers at its peak,[2] including 3,439 on a single day, August 14, 1930.[115] Many of the workers were Irish and Italian immigrants,[116] with a sizable minority of Mohawk ironworkers from the Kahnawake reserve near Montreal.[116][117][118] According to official accounts, five workers died during the construction,[119][120] although the New York Daily News gave reports of 14 deaths[3] and a headline in the socialist magazine The New Masses spread unfounded rumors of up to 42 deaths.[121][120] The Empire State Building cost $40,948,900 to build, including demolition of the Waldorf–Astoria (equivalent to $564,491,900 in 2019). This was lower than the $60 million budgeted for construction.[5] Lewis Hine captured many photographs of the construction, documenting not only the work itself but also providing insight into the daily life of workers in that era.[86][122][123] Hine's images were used extensively by the media to publish daily press releases.[124] According to the writer Jim Rasenberger, Hine ""climbed out onto the steel with the ironworkers and dangled from a derrick cable hundreds of feet above the city to capture, as no one ever had before (or has since), the dizzy work of building skyscrapers"". In Rasenberger's words, Hine turned what might have been an assignment of ""corporate flak"" into ""exhilarating art"".[125] These images were later organized into their own collection.[126] Onlookers were enraptured by the sheer height at which the steelworkers operated. New York magazine wrote of the steelworkers: ""Like little spiders they toiled, spinning a fabric of steel against the sky"".[113] Opening and early years The Empire State Building in 1932; the building had no antenna for the next 21 years, until 1953 The Empire State Building officially opened on May 1, 1931, forty-five days ahead of its projected opening date, and eighteen months from the start of construction.[127][2][128] The opening was marked with an event featuring United States President Herbert Hoover, who turned on the building's lights with the ceremonial button push from Washington, D.C.[129][130][4] Over 350 guests attended the opening ceremony, and following luncheon, at the 86th floor including Jimmy Walker, Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Al Smith.[4] An account from that day stated that the view from the luncheon was obscured by a fog, with other landmarks such as the Statue of Liberty being ""lost in the mist"" enveloping New York City.[131] The Empire State Building officially opened the next day.[131][75] Advertisements for the building's observatories were placed in local newspapers, while nearby hotels also capitalized on the events by releasing advertisements that lauded their proximity to the newly opened building.[132] According to The New York Times, builders and real estate speculators predicted that the 1,250-foot-tall (380 m) Empire State Building would be the world's tallest building ""for many years"", thus ending the great New York City skyscraper rivalry. At the time, most engineers agreed that it would be difficult to build a building taller than 1,200 feet (370 m), even with the hardy Manhattan bedrock as a foundation.[133] Technically, it was believed possible to build a tower of up to 2,000 feet (610 m), but it was deemed uneconomical to do so, especially during the Great Depression.[100][134] As the tallest building in the world, at that time, and the first one to exceed 100 floors, the Empire State Building became an icon of the city and, ultimately, of the nation.[135] In 1932, the Fifth Avenue Association gave the building its 1931 ""gold medal"" for architectural excellence, signifying that the Empire State had been the best-designed building on Fifth Avenue to open in 1931.[136] A year later, on March 2, 1933, the movie King Kong was released. The movie, which depicted a large stop motion ape named Kong climbing the Empire State Building, made the still-new building into a cinematic icon.[137][138] Tenants and tourism The Empire State Building's opening coincided with the Great Depression in the United States, and as a result much of its office space was vacant from its opening.[126] In the first year, only 23% of the available space was rented,[139][140] as compared to the early 1920s, where the average building would have occupancy of 52% upon opening and 90% rented within five years.[141] The lack of renters led New Yorkers to deride the building as the ""Empty State Building.[126][142] or ""Smith's Folly"".[143] The earliest tenants in the Empire State Building were large companies, banks, and garment industries.[143] Jack Brod, one of the building's longest resident tenants,[144][145] co-established the Empire Diamond Corporation with his father in the building in mid-1931[146] and rented space in the building until he died in 2008.[146] Brod recalled that there were only about 20 tenants at the time of opening, including him,[145] and that Al Smith was the only real tenant in the space above his seventh-floor offices.[144] Generally, during the early 1930s, it was rare for more than a single office space to be rented in the building, despite Smith's and Raskob's aggressive marketing efforts in the newspapers and to anyone they knew.[147] The building's lights were continuously left on, even in the unrented spaces, to give the impression of occupancy. This was exacerbated by competition from Rockefeller Center[139] as well as from buildings on 42nd Street, which, when combined with the Empire State Building, resulted in surplus of office space in a slow market during the 1930s.[148] Aggressive marketing efforts served to reinforce the Empire State Building's status as the world's tallest.[149] The observatory was advertised in local newspapers as well as on railroad tickets.[150] The building became a popular tourist attraction, with one million people each paying one dollar to ride elevators to the observation decks in 1931.[151] In its first year of operation, the observation deck made approximately $2 million in revenue, as much as its owners made in rent that year.[139][126] By 1936, the observation deck was crowded on a daily basis, with food and drink available for purchase at the top,[152] and by 1944 the building had received its five-millionth visitor.[153] In 1931, NBC took up tenancy, leasing space on the 85th floor for radio broadcasts.[154][155] From the outset the building was in debt, losing $1 million per year by 1935. Real estate developer Seymour Durst recalled that the building was so underused in 1936 that there was no elevator service above the 45th floor, as the building above the 41st floor was empty except for the NBC offices and the Raskob/Du Pont offices on the 81st floor.[156] Other events Per the original plans, the Empire State Building's spire was intended to be an airship docking station. Raskob and Smith had proposed dirigible ticketing offices and passenger waiting rooms on the 86th floor, while the airships themselves would be tied to the spire at the equivalent of the building's 106th floor.[157][158] An elevator would ferry passengers from the 86th to the 101st floor[g] after they had checked in on the 86th floor,[160] after which passengers would have climbed steep ladders to board the airship.[157] The idea, however, was impractical and dangerous due to powerful updrafts caused by the building itself,[161] the wind currents across Manhattan,[157] and the spires of nearby skyscrapers.[162] Furthermore, even if the airship were to successfully navigate all these obstacles, its crew would have to jettison some ballast by releasing water onto the streets below in order to maintain stability, and then tie the craft's nose to the spire with no mooring lines securing the tail end of the craft.[13][157][162] On September 15, 1931, a small commercial United States Navy airship circled 25 times in 45-mile-per-hour (72 km/h) winds.[163] The airship then attempted to dock at the mast, but its ballast spilled and the craft was rocked by unpredictable eddies.[164][165] The near-disaster scuttled plans to turn the building's spire into an airship terminal, although one blimp did manage to make a single newspaper delivery afterward.[38][157] On July 28, 1945, a B-25 Mitchell bomber crashed into the north side of the Empire State Building, between the 79th and 80th floors.[166] One engine completely penetrated the building and landed in a neighboring block, while the other engine and part of the landing gear plummeted down an elevator shaft. Fourteen people were killed in the incident,[167][70] but the building escaped severe damage and was reopened two days later.[167][168] Profitability The Empire State Building only started becoming profitable in the 1950s, when it was finally able to break even for the first time.[126][169] At the time, mass transit options in the building's vicinity were limited compared to the present day. Despite this challenge, the Empire State Building began to attract renters due to its reputation.[170] A 222-foot (68 m) radio antenna was erected on top of the towers starting in 1950,[171] allowing the area's television stations to be broadcast from the building.[172] However, despite the turnaround in the building's fortunes, Raskob listed it for sale in 1951,[173] with a minimum asking price of $50 million.[174] The property was purchased by business partners Roger L. Stevens, Henry Crown, Alfred R. Glancy and Ben Tobin.[175][176][177] The sale was brokered by the Charles F. Noyes Company, a prominent real estate firm in upper Manhattan,[174] for $51 million, the highest price paid for a single structure at the time.[178] By this time, the Empire State had been fully leased for several years with a waiting list of parties looking to lease space in the building, according to the Cortland Standard.[179] That same year, six news companies formed a partnership to pay a combined annual fee of $600,000 to use the building's antenna,[174] which was completed in 1953.[172] Crown bought out his partners' ownership stakes in 1954, becoming the sole owner.[180] The following year, the American Society of Civil Engineers named the building one of the ""Seven Modern Civil Engineering Wonders"".[181][182] In 1961, Lawrence A. Wien signed a contract to purchase the Empire State Building for $65 million, with Harry B. Helmsley acting as partners in the building's operating lease.[175][183] This became the new highest price for a single structure.[183] Over 3,000 people paid $10,000 for one share each in a company called Empire State Building Associates. The company in turn subleased the building to another company headed by Helmsley and Wien, raising $33 million of the funds needed to pay the purchase price.[175][183] In a separate transaction,[183] the land underneath the building was sold to Prudential Insurance for $29 million.[175][184] Helmsley, Wien, and Peter Malkin quickly started a program of minor improvement projects, including the first-ever full-building facade refurbishment and window-washing in 1962,[185][186] the installation of new flood lights on the 72nd floor in 1964,[187][188] and replacement of the manually operated elevators with automatic units in 1966.[189] The little-used western end of the second floor was used as a storage space until 1964, at which point it received escalators to the first floor as part of its conversion into a highly sought retail area.[190][191] Loss of ""tallest building"" title The World Trade Center's Twin Towers surpassed the Empire State Building in height by 1970.[192][193] In 1961, the same year that Helmsley, Wien, and Malkin had purchased the Empire State Building, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey formally backed plans for a new World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan.[194] The plan originally included 66-story twin towers with column-free open spaces. The Empire State's owners and real estate speculators were worried that the twin towers' 7.6 million square feet (710,000 m2) of office space would create a glut of rentable space in Manhattan as well as take away the Empire State Building's profits from lessees.[195] A revision in the World Trade Center's plan brought the twin towers to 1,370 feet (420 m) each or 110 stories, taller than the Empire State.[196] Opponents of the new project included prominent real-estate developer Robert Tishman, as well as Wien's Committee for a Reasonable World Trade Center.[196] In response to Wien's opposition, Port Authority executive director Austin J. Tobin said that Wien was only opposing the project because it would overshadow his Empire State Building as the world's tallest building.[197] The World Trade Center's twin towers started construction in 1966.[198] The following year, the Ostankino Tower succeeded the Empire State Building as the tallest freestanding structure in the world.[199] In 1970, the Empire State surrendered its position as the world's tallest building,[200] when the World Trade Center's still-under-construction North Tower surpassed it, on October 19;[192][193] the North Tower was topped out on December 23, 1970.[193][201] In December 1975, the observation deck was opened on the 110th floor of the Twin Towers, significantly higher than the 86th floor observatory on the Empire State Building.[70] The latter was also losing revenue during this period, particularly as a number of broadcast stations had moved to the World Trade Center in 1971; although the Port Authority continued to pay the broadcasting leases for the Empire State until 1984.[202] The Empire State Building was still seen as prestigious, having seen its forty-millionth visitor in March 1971.[203] 1980s and 1990s By 1980, there were nearly two million annual visitors,[151] although a building official had previously estimated between 1.5 million and 1.75 million annual visitors.[204] The building received its own ZIP code in May 1980 in a roll out of 63 new postal codes in Manhattan. At the time, its tenants collectively received 35,000 pieces of mail daily.[21] The Empire State Building celebrated its 50th anniversary on May 1, 1981, with a much-publicized, but poorly received, laser light show,[205] as well as an ""Empire State Building Week"" that ran through to May 8.[206][207] The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission voted to make the lobby a city landmark on May 19, 1981, citing the historic nature of the first and second floors, as well as ""the fixtures and interior components"" of the upper floors.[208] The building became a National Historic Landmark in 1986[10] in close alignment to the New York City Landmarks report.[209] The Empire State Building was added to the National Register of Historic Places the following year due to its architectural significance.[210] Capital improvements were made to the Empire State Building during the early to mid-1990s at a cost of $55 million.[211] These improvements entailed replacing alarm systems, elevators, windows, and air conditioning; making the observation deck compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA); and refurbishing the limestone facade.[212] The observatory renovation was added after disability rights groups and the United States Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against the building in 1992, in what was the first lawsuit filed by an organization under the new law.[213] A settlement was reached in 1994, in which the Empire State Building Associates agreed to add ADA-compliant elements, such as new elevators, ramps, and automatic doors, during its ongoing renovation.[214] Prudential sold the land under the building in 1991 for $42 million to a buyer representing hotelier Hideki Yokoi [ja], who was imprisoned at the time in connection with the deadly Hotel New Japan Fire [ja] at the Hotel New Japan [ja] in Tokyo.[215] In 1994, Donald Trump entered into a joint-venture agreement with Yokoi, with a shared goal of breaking the Empire State Building's lease on the land in an effort to gain total ownership of the building so that, if successful, the two could reap the potential profits of merging the ownership of the building with the land beneath it.[216] Having secured a half-ownership of the land, Trump devised plans to take ownership of the building itself so he could renovate it, even though Helmsley and Malkin had already started their refurbishment project.[211] He sued Empire State Building Associates in February 1995, claiming that the latter had caused the building to become a ""high-rise slum""[175] and a ""second-rate, rodent-infested"" office tower.[217] Trump had intended to have Empire State Building Associates evicted for violating the terms of their lease,[217] but was denied.[218] This led to Helmsley's companies countersuing Trump in May.[219] This sparked a series of lawsuits and countersuits that lasted several years,[175] partly arising from Trump's desire to obtain the building's master lease by taking it from Empire State Building Associates.[212] Upon Harry Helmsley's death in 1997, the Malkins sued Helmsley's widow, Leona Helmsley, for control of the building.[220] 21st century 2000s The building, tallest in New York, from 2001 to 2012, seen here in 2010 Following the destruction of the World Trade Center during the September 11 attacks in 2001, the Empire State Building again became the tallest building in New York City, but was only the second-tallest building in the Americas after the Sears (later Willis) Tower in Chicago.[199][221][222] As a result of the attacks, transmissions from nearly all of the city's commercial television and FM radio stations were again broadcast from the Empire State Building.[223] The attacks also led to an increase in security due to persistent terror threats against New York City landmarks.[224] In 2002, Trump and Yokoi sold their land claim to the Empire State Building Associates, now headed by Malkin, in a $57.5 million sale.[175][225] This action merged the building's title and lease for the first time in half a century.[225] Despite the lingering threat posed by the 9/11 attacks, the Empire State Building remained popular with 3.5 million visitors to the observatories in 2004, compared to about 2.8 million in 2003.[226] Even though she maintained her ownership stake in the building until the post-consolidation IPO in October 2013, Leona Helmsley handed over day-to-day operations of the building in 2006 to Peter Malkin's company.[175][227] In 2008, the building was temporarily ""stolen"" by the New York Daily News to show how easy it was to transfer the deed on a property, since city clerks were not required to validate the submitted information, as well as to help demonstrate how fraudulent deeds could be used to obtain large mortgages and then have individuals disappear with the money. The paperwork submitted to the city included the names of Fay Wray, the famous star of King Kong, and Willie Sutton, a notorious New York bank robber. The newspaper then transferred the deed back over to the legitimate owners, who at that time were Empire State Land Associates.[228] 2010s The current One World Trade Center (seen in the distance under construction) surpassed the Empire State Building's height on April 30, 2012 Starting in 2009, the building's public areas received a $550 million renovation, with improvements to the air conditioning and waterproofing, renovations to the observation deck and main lobby,[229] and relocation of the gift shop to the 80th floor.[230][231] About $120 million was spent on improving the energy efficiency of the building, with the goal of reducing energy emissions by 38% within five years.[231][232] For example, all of the windows were refurbished onsite into film-coated ""superwindows"" which block heat but pass light.[232][233][234] Air conditioning operating costs on hot days were reduced, saving $17 million of the project's capital cost immediately and partially funding some of the other retrofits.[233] The Empire State Building won the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold for Existing Buildings rating in September 2011, as well as the World Federation of Great Towers' Excellence in Environment Award for 2010.[234] For the LEED Gold certification, the building's energy reduction was considered, as was a large purchase of carbon offsets. Other factors included low-flow bathroom fixtures, green cleaning supplies, and use of recycled paper products.[235] On April 30, 2012, One World Trade Center topped out, taking the Empire State Building's record of tallest in the city.[236] By 2014, the building was owned by the Empire State Realty Trust (ESRT), with Anthony Malkin as chairman, CEO, and president.[237] The ESRT was a public company, having begun trading publicly on the New York Stock Exchange the previous year.[238] In August 2016, the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) was issued new fully diluted shares equivalent to 9.9% of the trust; this investment gave them partial ownership of the entirety of the ESRT's portfolio, and as a result, partial ownership of the Empire State Building.[239] The trust's president John Kessler called it an ""endorsement of the company's irreplaceable assets"".[240] The investment has been described by the real-estate magazine The Real Deal as ""an unusual move for a sovereign wealth fund"", as these funds typically buy direct stakes in buildings rather than real estate companies.[241] Other foreign entities that have a stake in the ESRT include investors from Norway, Japan, and Australia.[240] A renovation of the Empire State Building was commenced in the 2010s to further improve energy efficiency, public areas, and amenities.[1] In August 2018, to improve the flow of visitor traffic, the main visitor's entrance was shifted to 20 West 34th Street as part of a major renovation of the observatory lobby.[242] The new lobby includes several technological features, including large LED panels, digital ticket kiosks in nine languages, and a two-story architectural model of the building surrounded by two metal staircases.[1][242] The first phase of the renovation, completed in 2019, features an updated exterior lighting system and digital hosts.[242] The new lobby also features free Wi-Fi provided for those waiting.[1][243] A 10,000-square-foot (930 m2) exhibit with nine galleries, opened in July 2019.[244][245] The 102nd floor observatory, the third phase of the redesign, re-opened to the public on October 12, 2019.[246][247] That portion of the project included outfitting the space with floor-to-ceiling glass windows and a brand-new glass elevator.[248] The final portion of the renovations to be completed was a new observatory on the 80th floor, which opened on December 2, 2019. In total, the renovation had cost $165 million and taken four years to finish.[249][250] Design A pair of sculpted concrete eagles above the 5th Avenue entrance The Empire State Building is 1,250 ft (381 m) tall to its 102nd floor, or 1,453 feet 8+9⁄16 inches (443.092 m) including its 203-foot (61.9 m) pinnacle.[54] The building has 86 usable stories; the first through 85th floors contain 2.158 million square feet (200,500 m2) of commercial and office space, while the 86th story contains an observatory.[54][251] The remaining 16 stories are part of the Art Deco spire, which is capped by an observatory on the 102nd floor; the spire does not contain any intermediate levels and is used mostly for mechanical purposes.[54] Atop the 102nd story is the 203 ft (61.9 m) pinnacle, much of which is covered by broadcast antennas, and surmounted with a lightning rod.[166] The Empire State Building was the first building to have more than 100 floors.[135] The building has been named as one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World by the American Society of Civil Engineers.[252] The building and its street floor interior are designated landmarks of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, and confirmed by the New York City Board of Estimate.[253] It was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1986.[10][209][254] In 2007, it was first on the AIA's List of America's Favorite Architecture.[255] Form A series of setbacks causes the building to taper with height. The Empire State Building has a symmetrical massing, or shape, because of its large lot and relatively short base. The five-story base occupies the entire lot, while the 81-story tower above it is set back sharply from the base.[38][68][256] There are smaller setbacks on the upper stories, allowing sunlight to illuminate the interiors of the top floors, and positioning these floors away from the noisy streets below.[52][257] The setbacks are located at the 21st, 25th, 30th, 72nd, 81st, and 85th stories.[258] The setbacks were mandated as per the 1916 Zoning Resolution, which was intended to allow sunlight to reach the streets as well.[e] Normally, a building of the Empire State's dimensions would be permitted to build up to 12 stories on the Fifth Avenue side, and up to 17 stories on the 33rd/34th Streets side, before it would have to utilize setbacks.[68] However, with the largest setback being located above the base, the tower stories could contain a uniform shape.[264][265][53] According to architectural writer Robert A. M. Stern, the Empire State Building's form contrasted with the nearly contemporary, similarly designed 500 Fifth Avenue eight blocks north, which had an asymmetrical massing on a smaller lot.[38] Facade The Empire State Building's art deco design is typical of pre–World War II architecture in New York.[253] The facade is clad in Indiana limestone panels sourced from the Empire Mill in Sanders, Indiana,[266] which give the building its signature blonde color.[43] According to official fact sheets, the facade uses 200,000 cubic feet (5,700 m3) of limestone and granite, ten million bricks, and 730 short tons (650 long tons) of aluminum and stainless steel.[267] The building also contains 6,514 windows.[268] Main entrance pavilion on Fifth Avenue The main entrance, composed of three sets of metal doors, is at the center of the Fifth Avenue facade, flanked by molded piers that are topped with eagles. Above the main entrance is a transom, a triple-height transom window with geometric patterns, and the golden letters empire state above the fifth-floor windows.[256][127] There are two entrances each on 33rd and 34th Streets, with modernistic, stainless steel canopies projecting from the entrances on 33rd and 34th Streets there. Above the secondary entrances are triple windows, less elaborate in design than those on Fifth Avenue.[253][256][127] The storefronts on the first floor contain aluminum-framed doors and windows within a black granite cladding.[256][127] The second through fourth stories consist of windows alternating with wide stone piers and narrower stone mullions. The fifth story contains windows alternating with wide and narrow mullions, and is topped by a horizontal stone sill.[256] The facade of the tower stories is split into several vertical bays on each side, with windows projecting slightly from the limestone cladding. The bays are arranged into sets of one, two, or three windows on each floor.[269] The windows in each bay are separated by vertical nickel-chrome steel mullions and connected by horizontal aluminum spandrels on each floor.[258][127] Structural features The riveted steel frame of the building was originally designed to handle all of the building's gravitational stresses and wind loads.[270] The amount of material used in the building's construction resulted in a very stiff structure when compared to other skyscrapers, with a structural stiffness of 42 pounds per square foot (2.0 kPa) versus the Willis Tower's 33 pounds per square foot (1.6 kPa) and the John Hancock Center's 26 pounds per square foot (1.2 kPa).[271] A December 1930 feature in Popular Mechanics estimated that a building with the Empire State's dimensions would still stand even if hit with an impact of 50 short tons (45 long tons).[264] Utilities are grouped in a central shaft.[68] On the 6th through 86th stories, the central shaft is surrounded by a main corridor on all four sides.[53] As per the final specifications of the building, the corridor is surrounded in turn by office space 28 feet (8.5 m) deep, maximizing office space at a time before air conditioning became commonplace.[272][71] Each of the floors has 210 structural columns that pass through it, which provide structural stability, but limits the amount of open space on these floors.[53] However, the relative dearth of stone in the building allows for more space overall, with a 1:200 stone-to-building ratio in the Empire State compared to a 1:50 ratio in similar buildings.[100] Interior One of several elevator lobbies According to official fact sheets, the Empire State Building weighs 365,000 short tons (331,122 t) and has an internal volume of 37 million cubic feet (1,000,000 m3).[267] The interior required 1,172 miles (1,886 km) of elevator cable and 2 million feet (609,600 m) of electrical wires.[273] The Empire State Building has a total floor area of 2,768,591 sq ft (257,211 m2), and each of the floors in the base cover 2 acres (1 ha).[274] This gives the building capacity for 20,000 tenants and 15,000 visitors.[264] The Empire State Building contains 73 elevators.[232] Its original 64 elevators, built by the Otis Elevator Company,[274] are located in a central core and are of varying heights, with the longest of these elevators reaching from the lobby to the 80th floor.[68][275] As originally built, there were four ""express"" elevators that connected the lobby, 80th floor, and several landings in between; the other 60 ""local"" elevators connected the landings with the floors above these intermediate landings.[265] Of the 64 total elevators, 58 were for passenger use (comprising the four express elevators and 54 local elevators), and eight were for freight deliveries.[53] The elevators were designed to move at 1,200 feet per minute (366 m/min). At the time of the skyscraper's construction, their practical speed was limited to 700 feet per minute (213 m/min) as per city law, but this limit was removed shortly after the building opened.[274][53] Additional elevators connect the 80th floor to the six floors above it, as the six extra floors were built after the original 80 stories were approved.[54][276] The elevators were mechanically operated until 2011, when they were replaced with automatic elevators during the $550 million renovation of the building.[277] An additional elevator connects the 86th and 102nd floor observatories, which allows visitors access the 102nd floor observatory after having their tickets scanned. It also allows employees to access the mechanical floors located between the 87th and 101st floors. The Empire State Building has 73 elevators in all, including service elevators.[270] Lobby Fifth Avenue lobby The original main lobby is accessed from Fifth Avenue, on the building's east side, and contains an entrance with one set of double doors between a pair of revolving doors. At the top of each doorway is a bronze motif depicting one of three ""crafts or industries"" used in the building's construction—Electricity, Masonry, and Heating.[278] The lobby contains two tiers of marble, a lighter marble on the top, above the storefronts, and a darker marble on the bottom, flush with the storefronts. There is a pattern of zigzagging terrazzo tiles on the lobby floor, which leads from the entrance on the east to the aluminum relief on the west.[279] The chapel-like three-story-high lobby, which runs parallel to 33rd and 34th Streets, contains storefronts on both its northern and southern sides.[280] These storefronts are framed on each side by tubes of dark ""modernistically rounded marble"", according to the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, and above by a vertical band of grooves set into the marble.[279] Immediately inside the lobby is an airport-style security checkpoint.[281] The side entrances from 33rd and 34th Street lead to two-story-high corridors around the elevator core, crossed by stainless steel and glass-enclosed bridges at the second floor.[253][256] The walls on both the northern and southern sides of the lobby house storefronts and escalators to a mezzanine level.[279][h] At the west end of the lobby is an aluminum relief of the skyscraper as it was originally built (i.e. without the antenna).[282] The relief, which was intended to provide a welcoming effect,[283] contains an embossing of the building's outline, accompanied by what the Landmarks Preservation Commission describes as ""the rays of an aluminum sun shining out behind [the building] and mingling with aluminum rays emanating from the spire of the Empire State Building"". In the background is a state map of New York with the building's location marked by a ""medallion"" in the very southeast portion of the outline. A compass is located in the bottom right and a plaque to the building's major developers is on the bottom left.[284] Aluminum relief of the building The plaque at the western end of the lobby is located on the eastern interior wall of a one-story tall rectangular-shaped corridor that surrounds the banks of escalators, with a similar design to the lobby.[285] The rectangular-shaped corridor actually consists of two long hallways on the northern and southern sides of the rectangle,[286] as well as a shorter hallway on the eastern side and another long hallway on the western side.[285] At both ends of the northern and southern corridors, there is a bank of four low-rise elevators in between the corridors.[207] The western side of the rectangular elevator-bank corridor extends north to the 34th Street entrance and south to the 33rd Street entrance. It borders three large storefronts and leads to escalators that go both to the second floor and to the basement. Going from west to east, there are secondary entrances to 34th and 33rd Streets from both the northern and southern corridors, respectively, at approximately the two-thirds point of each corridor.[279][h] Until the 1960s, an art deco mural, inspired by both the sky and the Machine Age, was installed in the lobby ceilings.[282] Subsequent damage to these murals, designed by artist Leif Neandross, resulted in reproductions being installed. Renovations to the lobby in 2009, such as replacing the clock over the information desk in the Fifth Avenue lobby with an anemometer and installing two chandeliers intended to be part of the building when it originally opened, revived much of its original grandeur.[229] The north corridor contained eight illuminated panels created in 1963 by Roy Sparkia and Renée Nemorov, in time for the 1964 World's Fair, depicting the building as the Eighth Wonder of the World alongside the traditional seven.[207][287] The building's owners installed a series of paintings by the New York artist Kysa Johnson in the concourse level. Johnson later filed a federal lawsuit, in January 2014, under the Visual Artists Rights Act alleging the negligent destruction of the paintings and damage to her reputation as an artist.[288] As part of the building's 2010 renovation, Denise Amses commissioned a work consisting of 15,000 stars and 5,000 circles, superimposed on a 13-by-5-foot (4.0 by 1.5 m) etched-glass installation, in the lobby.[289] Above the 102nd floor The final stage of the building was the installation of a hollow mast, a 158-foot (48 m) steel shaft fitted with elevators and utilities, above the 86th floor. At the top would be a conical roof and the 102nd-floor docking station.[290][143] Inside, the elevators would ascend 167 feet (51 m) from the 86th floor ticket offices to a 33-foot-wide (10 m) 101st-floor[g] waiting room.[160][157] From there, stairs would lead to the 102nd floor,[g] where passengers would enter the airships.[290] The airships would have been moored to the spire at the equivalent of the building's 106th floor.[157][158] As constructed, the mast contains four rectangular tiers topped by a cylindrical shaft with a conical pinnacle.[143] On the 102nd floor (formerly the 101st floor), there is a door with stairs ascending to the 103rd floor (formerly the 102nd).[g] This was built as a disembarkation floor for airships tethered to the building's spire, and has a circular balcony outside.[13] It is now an access point to reach the spire for maintenance. The room now contains electrical equipment, but celebrities and dignitaries may also be given permission to take pictures there.[291][292] Above the 103rd floor, there is a set of stairs and a ladder to reach the spire for maintenance work.[291] The mast's 480 windows were all replaced in 2015.[293] The mast serves as the base of the building's broadcasting antenna.[143] Broadcast stations Antenna for broadcast stations are located at the top of the building Broadcasting began at the Empire State Building on December 22, 1931, when NBC and RCA began transmitting experimental television broadcasts from a small antenna erected atop the mast, with two separate transmitters for the visual and audio data. They leased the 85th floor and built a laboratory there.[155] In 1934, RCA was joined by Edwin Howard Armstrong in a cooperative venture to test his FM system from the building's antenna.[294][295] This setup, which entailed the installation of the world's first FM transmitter,[295] continued only until October of the next year due to disputes between RCA and Armstrong.[155][294] Specifically, NBC wanted to install more TV equipment in the room where Armstrong's transmitter was located.[295] After some time, the 85th floor became home to RCA's New York television operations initially as experimental station W2XBS channel 1 then, from 1941, as commercial station WNBT channel 1 (now WNBC channel 4). NBC's FM station, W2XDG, began transmitting from the antenna in 1940.[155][296] NBC retained exclusive use of the top of the building until 1950 when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ordered the exclusive deal be terminated. The FCC directive was based on consumer complaints that a common location was necessary for the seven extant New York-area television stations to transmit from so that receiving antennas would not have to be constantly adjusted. Other television broadcasters would later join RCA at the building on the 81st through 83rd floors, often along with sister FM stations.[155] Construction of a dedicated broadcast tower began on July 27, 1950,[171] with TV, and FM, transmissions starting in 1951. The 200-foot (61 m) broadcast tower was completed in 1953.[143][43][172] From 1951, six broadcasters agreed to pay a combined $600,000 per year for the use of the antenna.[174] In 1965, a separate set of FM antennae was constructed ringing the 103rd floor observation area to act as a master antenna.[155] The placement of the stations in the Empire State Building became a major issue with the construction of the World Trade Center's Twin Towers in the late 1960s, and early 1970s. The greater height of the Twin Towers would reflect radio waves broadcast from the Empire State Building, eventually resulting in some broadcasters relocating to the newer towers instead of suing the developer, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.[297] Even though the nine stations who were broadcasting from the Empire State Building were leasing their broadcast space until 1984, most of these stations moved to the World Trade Center as soon as it was completed in 1971. The broadcasters obtained a court order stipulating that the Port Authority had to build a mast and transmission equipment in the North Tower, as well as pay the broadcasters' leases in the Empire State Building until 1984.[202] Only a few broadcasters renewed their leases in the Empire State Building.[298] The September 11 attacks in 2001 destroyed the World Trade Center and the broadcast centers atop it, leaving most of the city's stations without a station for ten days until a temporary tower was built in Alpine, New Jersey.[299] By October 2001, nearly all of the city's commercial broadcast stations (both television and FM radio) were again transmitting from the top of the Empire State Building. In a report that Congress commissioned about the transition from analog television to digital television, it was stated that the placement of broadcast stations in the Empire State Building was considered ""problematic"" due to interference from nearby buildings. In comparison, the Congressional report stated that the former Twin Towers had very few buildings of comparable height nearby thus signals suffered little interference.[223] In 2003, a few FM stations were relocated to the nearby Condé Nast Building to reduce the number of broadcast stations using the Empire State Building.[300] Eleven television stations and twenty-two FM stations had signed 15-year leases in the building by May 2003. It was expected that a taller broadcast tower in Bayonne, New Jersey, or Governors Island, would be built in the meantime with the Empire State Building being used as a ""backup"" since signal transmissions from the building were generally of poorer quality.[301] Following the construction of One World Trade Center in the late 2000s and early 2010s, some TV stations began moving their transmitting facilities there.[302] As of 2018[update], the Empire State Building is home to the following stations:[303] Television: WABC-7, WPIX-11, WXTV-41 Paterson, and WFUT-68 Newark FM: WNYL-92.3, WPAT-93.1 Paterson, WNYC-93.9, WPLJ-95.5, WXNY-96.3, WQHT-97.1, WSKQ-97.9, WEPN-98.7, WHTZ-100.3 Newark, WCBS-101.1, WFAN-101.9, WNEW-FM-102.7, WKTU-103.5 Lake Success, WAXQ-104.3, WWPR-105.1, WQXR-105.9 Newark, WLTW-106.7 and WBLS-107.5 Observation decks 80th floor observation deck The 80th, 86th, and 102nd floors contain observatories.[304][282][250] The latter two observatories saw a combined average of four million visitors per year in 2010.[105][305][306] Since opening, the observatories have been more popular than similar observatories at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, the Chrysler Building, the first One World Trade Center, or the Woolworth Building, despite being more expensive.[305] There are variable charges to enter the observatories; one ticket allows visitors to go as high as the 86th floor, and there is an additional charge to visit the 102nd floor. Other ticket options for visitors include scheduled access to view the sunrise from the observatory, a ""premium"" guided tour with VIP access, and the ""AM/PM"" package which allows for two visits in the same day.[307] Interior and exterior observation decks at the 86th floor The 86th floor observatory contains both an enclosed viewing gallery and an open-air outdoor viewing area, allowing for it to remain open 365 days a year regardless of the weather. The 102nd floor observatory is completely enclosed and much smaller in size. The 102nd floor observatory was closed to the public from the late 1990s to 2005 due to limited viewing capacity and long lines.[308][309] The observation decks were redesigned in mid-1979.[204] The 102nd floor was again redesigned in a project that was completed in 2019, allowing the windows to be extended from floor to ceiling and widening the space in the observatory overall.[246][247] An observatory on the 80th floor, opened in 2019, includes various exhibits as well as a mural of the skyline drawn by British artist Stephen Wiltshire.[249][250] According to a 2010 report by Concierge.com, the five lines to enter the observation decks are ""as legendary as the building itself"". Concierge.com stated that there are five lines: the sidewalk line, the lobby elevator line, the ticket purchase line, the second elevator line, and the line to get off the elevator and onto the observation deck.[310] However, in 2016, New York City's official tourism website, NYCgo.com, made note of only three lines: the security check line, the ticket purchase line, and the second elevator line.[311] Following renovations completed in 2019, designed to streamline queuing and reduce wait times, guests enter from a single entrance on 34th Street, where they make their way through 10,000-square-foot (930 m2) exhibits on their way up to the observatories. Guests were offered a variety of ticket packages, including a package that enables them to skip the lines throughout the duration of their stay.[247] The Empire State Building garners significant revenue from ticket sales for its observation decks, making more money from ticket sales than it does from renting office space during some years.[305][312] A 360° panoramic view of New York City from the 86th-floor observation deck in spring 2005. East River is to the left, Hudson River to the right, south is near center. New York Skyride In early 1994, a motion simulator attraction was built on the 2nd floor,[313] as a complement to the observation deck.[314] The original cinematic presentation lasted approximately 25 minutes, while the simulation was about eight minutes.[315] The ride had two incarnations. The original version, which ran from 1994 until around 2002, featured James Doohan, Star Trek's Scotty, as the airplane's pilot who humorously tried to keep the flight under control during a storm.[316][317] After the World Trade Center terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the ride was closed.[314] An updated version debuted in mid-2002, featuring actor Kevin Bacon as the pilot, with the new flight also going haywire.[318] This new version served a more informative goal, as opposed to the old version's main purpose of entertainment, and contained details about the 9/11 attacks.[319] The simulator received mixed reviews, with assessments of the ride ranging from ""great"" to ""satisfactory"" to ""corny"".[320] Lights The building lit up for NYC Pride in 2015 The building was originally equipped with white searchlights at the top. They were first used in November 1932 when they lit up to signal Roosevelt's victory over Hoover in the presidential election of that year.[321] These were later swapped for four ""Freedom Lights"" in 1956.[321] In February 1964, flood lights were added on the 72nd floor[187] to illuminate the top of the building at night so that the building could be seen from the World Fair later that year.[188] The lights were shut off from November 1973 to July 1974 because of the energy crisis at the time.[32] In 1976, the businessman Douglas Leigh suggested that Wien and Helmsley install 204 metal-halide lights, which were four times as bright as the 1,000 incandescent lights they were to replace.[322] New red, white, and blue metal-halide lights were installed in time for the country's bicentennial that July.[32][323] After the bicentennial, Helmsley retained the new lights due to the reduced maintenance cost, about $116 a year.[322] Since 1976, the spire has been lit in colors chosen to match seasonal events and holidays. Organizations are allowed to make requests through the building's website.[324] The building is also lit in the colors of New York-based sports teams on nights when they host games: for example, orange, blue, and white for the New York Knicks; red, white, and blue for the New York Rangers.[325] It was twice lit in scarlet to support New Jersey's Rutgers University, once for a football game against the University of Louisville on November 9, 2006, and again on April 3, 2007, when the women's basketball team played in the national championship game.[326] The spire can also be lit to commemorate occasions such as disasters, anniversaries, or deaths. For instance, in 1998, the building was lit in blue after the death of singer Frank Sinatra, who was nicknamed ""Ol' Blue Eyes"".[327] The structure was lit in red, white, and blue for several months after the destruction of the World Trade Center in September 2001.[328] On January 13, 2012, the building was lit in red, orange, and yellow to honor the 60th anniversary of NBC program The Today Show.[329] After retired basketball player Kobe Bryant's January 2020 death, the building was lit in purple and gold, signifying the colors of his former team, the Los Angeles Lakers.[330] Lights representing the Democratic and Republican parties just prior to the 2012 election In 2012, the building's four hundred metal halide lamps and floodlights were replaced with 1,200 LED fixtures, increasing the available colors from nine to over 16 million.[331] The computer-controlled system allows the building to be illuminated in ways that were unable to be done previously with plastic gels.[332] For instance, on November 6, 2012, CNN used the top of the Empire State Building as a scoreboard for the 2012 United States presidential election. When incumbent president Barack Obama had reached the 270 electoral votes necessary to win re-election, the lights turned blue, representing the color of Obama's Democratic Party. Had Republican challenger Mitt Romney won, the building would have been lit red, the color of the Republican Party.[333] Also, on November 26, 2012, the building had its first synchronized light show, using music from recording artist Alicia Keys.[334] Artists such as Eminem and OneRepublic have been featured in later shows, including the building's annual Holiday Music-to-Lights Show.[335] The building's owners adhere to strict standards in using the lights; for instance, they do not use the lights to play advertisements.[332] Height records Height comparison of several New York City buildings, with Empire State second from left The longest world record held by the Empire State Building was for the tallest skyscraper (to structural height), which it held for 42 years until it was surpassed by the North Tower of the World Trade Center in October 1970.[199][221][336] The Empire State Building was also the tallest man-made structure in the world before it was surpassed by the Griffin Television Tower Oklahoma (KWTV Mast) in 1954,[337] and the tallest freestanding structure in the world until the completion of the Ostankino Tower in 1967.[199] An early-1970s proposal to dismantle the spire and replace it with an additional 11 floors, which would have brought the building's height to 1,494 feet (455 m) and made it once again the world's tallest at the time, was considered but ultimately rejected.[338] With the destruction of the World Trade Center in the September 11 attacks, the Empire State Building again became the tallest building in New York City, and the second-tallest building in the Americas, surpassed only by the Willis Tower in Chicago. The Empire State Building remained the tallest building in New York until the new One World Trade Center reached a greater height in April 2012.[199][221][222][339] As of September 2020[update], it is the seventh-tallest building in New York City after One World Trade Center, 111 West 57th Street, Central Park Tower, One Vanderbilt, 432 Park Avenue, and 30 Hudson Yards. It is the fifth-tallest completed skyscraper in the United States behind the two other tallest buildings in New York City, as well as the Willis Tower and Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago.[340] The Empire State Building is the 49th-tallest in the world as of February 2021[update].[341] It is also the sixth-tallest freestanding structure in the Americas behind the five tallest buildings and the CN Tower.[342] Notable tenants As of 2013[update], the building houses around 1,000 businesses.[343] Current tenants include: Air China[344] Boy Scouts of America, Greater New York Councils[345] Bulova[346] Coty[347] Croatian National Tourist Board[348] Expedia Group[349] Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation[350] Global Brands Group[346] Filipino Reporter[348] Helios and Matheson[351] HNTB[352] Human Rights Foundation[353] Human Rights Watch[348] JCDecaux[346] Kaplan International Center[354] Li & Fung[355] LinkedIn[356] Media General[357] Noven Pharmaceuticals[358] Palo Alto Networks[346] People's Daily[359] Qatar Airways[360] RaySearch Laboratories[361] Shutterstock[346] Skanska[346] Turkish Airlines[362] Workday, Inc.[363] World Monuments Fund[364] Former tenants include: The National Catholic Welfare Council (now Catholic Relief Services, located in Baltimore)[365] The King's College (now located at 56 Broadway)[366] China National Tourist Office[348] (now located at 370 Lexington Avenue)[367] National Film Board of Canada[348] (now located at 1123 Broadway)[368] Nathaniel Branden Institute[369] Schenley Industries[370] YWCA of the USA[371] (relocated to Washington, DC[372]) Incidents 1945 plane crash Main article: B-25 Empire State Building crash Wreckage from the 1945 Empire State Building B-25 crash At 9:40 am on July 28, 1945, a B-25 Mitchell bomber, piloted in thick fog by Lieutenant Colonel William Franklin Smith Jr.,[373] crashed into the north side of the Empire State Building between the 79th and 80th floors where the offices of the National Catholic Welfare Council were located.[166] One engine completely penetrated the building, landing on the roof of a nearby building where it started a fire that destroyed a penthouse.[365][374] The other engine and part of the landing gear plummeted down an elevator shaft causing a fire, which was extinguished in 40 minutes. Fourteen people were killed in the incident.[167][70] Elevator operator Betty Lou Oliver survived a plunge of 75 stories inside an elevator, which still stands as the Guinness World Record for the longest survived elevator fall recorded.[375] Despite the damage and loss of life, the building was open for business on many floors two days later.[167][168] The crash helped spur the passage of the long-pending Federal Tort Claims Act of 1946, as well as the insertion of retroactive provisions into the law, allowing people to sue the government for the incident.[376] Also as a result of the crash, the Civil Aeronautics Administration enacted strict regulations regarding flying over New York City, setting a minimum flying altitude of 2,500 feet (760 m) above sea level regardless of the weather conditions.[377][167] A year later, on July 24, 1946, another aircraft narrowly missed striking the building. The unidentified twin-engine plane scraped past the observation deck, scaring the tourists there.[378] 2000 elevator plunge On January 24, 2000, an elevator in the building suddenly descended 40 stories after a cable that controlled the cabin's maximum speed was severed.[379] The elevator fell from the 44th floor to the fourth floor, where a narrowed elevator shaft provided a second safety system. Despite the 40-floor fall, both of the passengers in the cabin at the time were only slightly injured.[380] Since that elevator had no fourth-floor doors, the passengers were rescued by an adjacent elevator.[381] After the fall, building inspectors reviewed all of the building's elevators.[380] Suicide attempts Because of the building's iconic status, it and other Midtown landmarks are popular locations for suicide attempts.[382] More than 30 people have attempted suicide over the years by jumping from the upper parts of the building, with most attempts being successful.[383][384] The first suicide from the building occurred on April 7, 1931, before it was even completed, when a carpenter who had been laid-off went to the 58th floor and jumped.[385] The first suicide after the building's opening occurred from the 86th floor observatory in February 1935, when Irma P. Eberhardt fell 1,029 feet (314 m) onto a marquee sign.[386] On December 16, 1943, William Lloyd Rambo jumped to his death from the 86th floor, landing amidst Christmas shoppers on the street below.[387] In the early morning of September 27, 1946, shell-shocked Marine Douglas W. Brashear Jr. jumped from the 76th-floor window of the Grant Advertising Agency; police found his shoes 50 feet (15 m) from his body.[388] On May 1, 1947, Evelyn McHale leapt to her death from the 86th floor observation deck and landed on a limousine parked at the curb. Photography student Robert Wiles took a photo of McHale's oddly intact corpse a few minutes after her death. The police found a suicide note among possessions that she left on the observation deck: ""He is much better off without me.... I wouldn't make a good wife for anybody"". The photo ran in the May 12, 1947 edition of Life magazine[389] and is often referred to as ""The Most Beautiful Suicide"". It was later used by visual artist Andy Warhol in one of his prints entitled Suicide (Fallen Body).[390] A 7-foot (2.1 m) mesh fence was put up around the 86th floor terrace in December 1947 after five people tried to jump during a three-week span in October and November of that year.[391][392] By then, sixteen people had died from suicide jumps.[391] Only one person has jumped from the upper observatory. Frederick Eckert of Astoria ran past a guard in the enclosed 102nd-floor gallery on November 3, 1932, and jumped a gate leading to an outdoor catwalk intended for dirigible passengers. He landed and died on the roof of the 86th floor observation promenade.[393] Two people have survived falls by not falling more than a floor. On December 2, 1979, Elvita Adams jumped from the 86th floor, only to be blown back onto a ledge on the 85th floor by a gust of wind and left with a broken hip.[394][395][396] On April 25, 2013, a man fell from the 86th floor observation deck, but he landed alive with minor injuries on an 85th-floor ledge where security guards brought him inside and paramedics transferred him to a hospital for a psychiatric evaluation.[397] Shootings Two fatal shootings have occurred in the direct vicinity of the Empire State Building. Abu Kamal, a 69-year-old Palestinian teacher, shot seven people on the 86th floor observation deck during the afternoon of February 23, 1997. He killed one person and wounded six others before committing suicide.[398] Kamal reportedly committed the shooting in response to events happening in Palestine and Israel.[399] On the morning of August 24, 2012, 58-year-old Jeffrey T. Johnson shot and killed a former co-worker on the building's Fifth Avenue sidewalk. He had been laid off from his job in 2011. Two police officers confronted the gunman, and he aimed his firearm at them. They responded by firing 16 shots, killing him but also wounding nine bystanders. Most of the injured were hit by bullet fragments, although three took direct hits from bullets.[12][400] Impact The Empire State Building, Glenn Odem Coleman,c. 1931 As the tallest building in the world and the first one to exceed 100 floors, the Empire State Building immediately became an icon of the city and of the nation.[126][135][203] In 2013, Time magazine noted that the Empire State Building ""seems to completely embody the city it has become synonymous with"".[401] The historian John Tauranac called it ""'the' twentieth-century New York building"", despite the existence of taller and more modernist buildings.[402] Early architectural critics also focused on the Empire State Building's exterior ornamentation.[38] Architectural critic Talbot Hamlin wrote in 1931, ""That it is the world's tallest building is purely incidental.""[403] George Shepard Chappell, writing in The New Yorker under the pseudonym ""T-Square"", wrote the same year that the Empire State Building had a ""palpably enormous"" appeal to the general public, and that ""its difference and distinction [lay] in the extreme sensitiveness of its entire design"".[38][404] However, architectural critics also wrote negatively of the mast, especially in light of its failure to become a real air terminal. Chappell called the mast ""a silly gesture"" and Lewis Mumford called it ""a public comfort station for migratory birds"".[38] Nevertheless, architecture critic Douglas Haskell said the Empire State Building's appeal came from the fact that it was ""caught at the exact moment of transition—caught between metal and stone, between the idea of 'monumental mass' and that of airy volume, between handicraft and machine design, and in the swing from what was essentially handicraft to what will be essentially industrial methods of fabrication.""[405][406] Status as an icon Early in the building's history, travel companies such as Short Line Motor Coach Service and New York Central Railroad used the building as an icon to symbolize the city.[407] After the construction of the first World Trade Center, architect Paul Goldberger noted that the Empire State Building ""is famous for being tall, but it is good enough to be famous for being good.""[204] As an icon of the United States, it is also very popular among Americans. In a 2007 survey, the American Institute of Architects found that the Empire State Building was ""America's favorite building"".[408] The building was originally a symbol of hope in a country devastated by the Depression, as well as a work of accomplishment by newer immigrants.[126] The writer Benjamin Flowers states that the Empire State was ""a building intended to celebrate a new America, built by men (both clients and construction workers) who were themselves new Americans.""[121] The architectural critic Jonathan Glancey refers to the building as an ""icon of American design"".[343] The Empire State Building has been hailed as an example of a ""wonder of the world"" due to the massive effort expended during construction. The Washington Star listed it as part of one of the ""seven wonders of the modern world"" in 1931, while Holiday magazine wrote in 1958 that the Empire State's height would be taller than the combined heights of the Eiffel Tower and the Great Pyramid of Giza.[402] The American Society of Civil Engineers also declared the building ""A Modern Civil Engineering Wonder of the United States"" in 1958, and one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World in 1994.[182] Ron Miller, in a 2010 book, also described the Empire State Building as one of the ""seven wonders of engineering"".[409] It has often been called the Eighth Wonder of the World as well, an appellation that it has held since shortly after opening.[69][164][410] The panels installed in the lobby in 1963 reflected this, showing the seven original wonders alongside the Empire State Building.[287] The Empire State Building also became the standard of reference to describe the height and length of other structures globally, both natural and man-made.[411] In popular culture Main article: Empire State Building in popular culture As an icon of New York City, the Empire State Building has been featured in various films, books, TV shows, and video games. According to the building's official website, more than 250 movies contain depictions of the Empire State Building.[412] In his book about the building, John Tauranac writes that its first documented appearance in popular culture was Swiss Family Manhattan, a 1932 children's story by Christopher Morley.[413] A year later, the film King Kong depicted Kong, a large stop motion ape that climbs the Empire State Building,[137][138][281] bringing the building into the popular imagination.[281] Later movies such as An Affair to Remember (1957), Sleepless in Seattle (1993), and Independence Day (1996) also featured the building.[414][412] The building has also been featured in other works, such as ""Daleks in Manhattan"", a 2007 episode of the TV series Doctor Who;[414] and Empire, an eight-hour black-and-white silent film by Andy Warhol,[414] which was later added to the Library of Congress's National Film Registry.[415] Empire State Building Run-Up The Empire State Building Run-Up, a foot race from ground level to the 86th-floor observation deck, has been held annually since 1978. Its participants are referred to both as runners and as climbers, and are often tower running enthusiasts. The race covers a vertical distance of 1,050 ft (320 m) and takes in 1,576 steps. The record time is 9 minutes and 33 seconds, achieved by Australian professional cyclist Paul Crake in 2003, at a climbing rate of 6,593 ft (2,010 m) per hour.[416][417] See also New York City portal New York (state) portal Architecture portal Early skyscrapers NTT Docomo Yoyogi Building List of buildings with 100 floors or more List of National Historic Landmarks in New York City List of New York City Designated Landmarks in Manhattan from 14th to 59th Streets List of tallest buildings by U.S. state List of tallest freestanding steel structures National Register of Historic Places listings in Manhattan from 14th to 59th Streets References Notes ^ The tenants' entrance is located at 350 Fifth Avenue, while the visitors' entrance is located at 20 West 34th Street.[1] ^ a b The Empire State Building is located within the 10001 zip code area,[20] but 10118 has been assigned as the building's own zip code by the United States Postal Service[17][18] since 1980.[21] ^ a b Most sources state that there are 102 floors,[7][8][9] but some give a figure of 103 floors due to the presence of a balcony above the 102nd floor.[12][13] See § Opening and early years and § Above the 102nd floor for a detailed explanation. ^ These stations are respectively served by: 34th Street–Penn Station: 1, ​2, and ​3 trains 34th Street–Herald Square: B, ​D, ​F, <F>, ​M​, N, ​Q, ​R, and ​W trains 33rd Street: 6 and <6>​ trains[25] ^ a b As per the 1916 Zoning Act, the wall of any given tower that faces a street could only rise to a certain height, proportionate to the street's width, at which point the building had to be set back by a given proportion. This system of setbacks would continue until the tower reaches a floor level in which that level's floor area was 25% that of the ground level's area. After that 25% threshold was reached, the building could rise without restriction.[53][259][260] The 1916 Zoning Act was amended in 1961 so that buildings erected thereafter could not exceed a floor area ratio that was calculated for each zoning district.[261] The maximum ratio for the Empire State Building's district is 15, unless it includes a public plaza.[262] A grandfather clause permits preexisting structures to continue under the old rule. Therefore, the Empire State Building's floor area ratio of 25 cannot be duplicated, or even approached, by a new building in that district.[263] ^ These proposals included the 100-story Metropolitan Life North Building; a 1,050-foot (320 m) tower built by Abraham E. Lefcourt at Broadway and 49th Street; a 100-story tower developed by the Fred F. French Company on Sixth Avenue between 43rd and 44th Streets; an 85-story tower to be developed on the site of the Belmont Hotel near Grand Central Terminal; and the Noyes-Schulte Company's proposed tower on Broadway between Duane and Worth Streets. Only one of these projects was even partially completed: the base of the Metropolitan Life North Building.[57] ^ a b c d The 101st floor was later renamed the 102nd floor and is 101 floors above ground. The former 102nd floor, now the 103rd floor, is now a balcony that is off-limits to the public, and is 102 floors above ground.[159] ^ a b See Landmarks Preservation Commission Interior 1981, PDF page 26, for a diagram of the lobby.

According to a report on animal testing statistics published by the Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency, the number of animals used for testing in South Korea was 4,141,433 in 2020. This figure is a 43.8% increase compared to five years ago, when 2,878,907 animals were subjected to testing in 2016. While animal testing is increasing, there is an effort to replace animal testing and introduce scientifically sound alternatives. In Europe and the United States, pharmaceutical companies are already starting to use organoids and organ-on-a-chip models. These technologies can emulate human physiology and are used to test substances instead of animal experiments. The PAAM Act petition campaign aims to raise public awareness about the importance of promoting alternatives to animal testing both to reduce cruelty to animals and to improve human health. Citizens will be encouraged to participate in signing the petition that urges central government and lawmakers to pass the bill. PAAM Act was introduced to the National Assembly in December 2020 and is sponsored by assembly member In-soon Nam. The bill is focused on supporting development of new methods that can mimic human biology or using computer-based approaches while moving away from relying on animal models. It also provides a legal ground for collaboration among central authorities to disseminate these developed methods through harmonized planning. Along with the launch of the petition page, a mini webinar titled ‘Let’s learn about animal testing and alternatives’ will be released through Lush Korea’s YouTube channel in September. The webinar will feature HSI/Korea, Lush Korea, PNR and Jae-Sung Kwon, an assistant professor at the College of Dentistry at Younsei University. The panelists will discuss the status of animal testing, developing replacement approaches and why the PAAM Act is important. Borami Seo, interim executive director and senior policy manager for HSI/Korea, said: “The PAAM Act took three years of preparation including consulting with relevant institutions and experts. The bill is important in that it stipulates unprecedented, but much needed, initiatives to bring central governments together to put Korea on track for the progress in health research based on more effective, science sounding approaches than animal testing.” Won Jung Park, ethics director for Lush Korea said: “Considering an increasing interest in ethical consumerism in the 4th industrial revolution era where modern technologies are emerging, PAAM Act is what we need now. Lush Korea has long been supporting work around animal testing replacement. I hope that this PAAM Act petition campaign will contribute to speedy passage of the bill and bring an end to cruel and unnecessary animal testing.” Anyone can show their support for the PAAM Act petition campaign by visiting Lush Korea stores or lush.co.kr/animalfreetesting.

The charitable enterprise builds on the methodology and project experience of the former HUMBOLDT-VIADRINA School of Governance. Their mission “is the support of democratic processes and well-grounded Governance strategies in Germany, Europe, and the world, the support of cooperation between various actors in society with sciences and the media in order to enable understanding through discussion-based exchange to further a sustainable economy and politics, and to strengthen transparency, democratic participation, and citizens’ responsibility. This is to occur within the scope of transdisciplinarity, i.e. the merging of know-how of the knowledge society with the methodically proven knowledge of science, in order to find solutions to challenges and problems of the present through mutual exchange. A particular focus is set on global democratization and Good Governance projects, which are suitable for theoretically and practically advancing democracy in Germany, the EU, and the world.” In 2015 and 2017, together with the HVGP, the Canopus Foundation organized three “Economic Trialogues” on the subject of the “Special German path? An assessment of the current situation of economic policy and economic sciences in Germany”, in which representatives from various economic schools of thought were brought together in dialogues with representatives from politics, business, media, and civil society.

The party has nominated her twice as a candidate for the federal presidential elections. On 23 May 2004, she was defeated by the Christian Democrat Horst Köhler. On 23 May 2009, Köhler beat her again to win his second term.[1] Contents 1 Personal life 2 Academic life 2.1 Education 2.2 Early career 2.3 Professorship 3 Political career 3.1 Presidential elections 3.2 Later political career 4 Other activities 5 Controversy 6 Bibliography 7 Awards and honours 8 References Personal life[edit] Born in Berlin on 22 May 1943, Schwan was baptized in the Roman Catholic faith[2] as the daughter of Oberschulrat (Senior School Inspector) Hans R. Schneider. During the Third Reich dictatorship her parents were members of the passive resistance,[3] offering protection to a Jewish girl by hiding her. After World War II, the family engaged actively in the reconciliation of Polish–German relations. In 1969, Schwan married her first husband, Professor Alexander Schwan, with whom she had two children and who died in 1989.[3] In 2004, Gesine Schwan celebrated her second wedding with longtime companion Peter Eigen in Berlin. He is a former World Bank manager as well as a founder and current Chair of the Advisory Council of Transparency International. Schwan is very engaged in German and Polish mutual understanding and therefore supports, in numerous ways, the work of the Freya von Moltke Stiftung for the New Kreisau. She has given numerous presentations on this topic.[4] Academic life[edit] Education[edit] In 1962, Schwan graduated (Abitur) from the bilingual Französisches Gymnasium, a German-French secondary school in Berlin. In the same year, she began her studies in history, philosophy, romance languages, and political science at the Free University of Berlin and later at University of Freiburg.[5] Early career[edit] After research stays in Warsaw and Kraków, she obtained her Ph.D. in 1970 from FU Berlin for a dissertation on the Polish philosopher Leszek Kołakowski.[6] After that, she became assistant professor at the same university. Here, she continued her works on the critique of Marx[7] for which she received the habilitation in 1975. Professorship[edit] Schwan was appointed full professor at the Department of Political Science at FU Berlin in 1977. At the time, her research fields encompassed political theory, philosophy, psychology, and culture as well as theories of democracy and socialism. In 1980/81, she had a research stay at the Wilson Center for Scholars in the USA; another research stay in 1984 at the Robinson College at Cambridge University; in 1998, she was visiting professor at the New School for Social Research in New York. From 1993 to 1995, she was dean of the Political Science Faculty at FU Berlin.[5] In 1999, Gesine Schwan competed for the post of president of FU Berlin, but was defeated by Peter Gaehtgens.[8] In the same year, she was elected as the president of Viadrina European University in Frankfurt (Oder).[8] Political career[edit] Schwan belongs to the German tradition of social democratic opposition to Karl Marx's theories. In September 1974, she was one of the founding members of the Seeheimer Kreis, a conservative think tank within the SPD.[9] She became a member of the SPD Grundwertekommission (Commission for Fundamental Values) in 1977. In 1984, she was removed from this position after criticizing the party's Ostpolitik as cooperating too closely with communist governments, while not engaging enough with dissidents.[10] Rather she sought for support and dialog with those Eastern Europeans who would dare to criticize their governments.[11] Schwan was reinstated in the Grundwertekommission in 1996. Since 2002, she has presided over the German-Polish Forum together with Janusz Reiter. In November 2004, the German government under Gerhard Schröder appointed her to the newly created office of the co-ordinator for cooperation with Poland (her counterpart on the Polish side was then Irena Lipowicz).[5] She retained this position when the government changed and became headed by Christian Democrat Angela Merkel. In February 2009, she criticized Schröder for being too uncritical towards Vladimir Putin and too insensitive about Polish concerns about closer German-Russian ties.[12] On 15 September 2010, Schwan supported the new initiative Spinelli Group in the European Parliament, which was founded to reinvigorate the strive for federalisation of the European Union (EU). Other prominent supporters are: Jacques Delors, Daniel Cohn-Bendit, Guy Verhofstadt, Jo Leinen, Andrew Duff, and Elmar Brok. Presidential elections[edit] On 23 May 2004, Schwan was the SPD candidate for the German presidential election. She received 589 votes in the Bundesversammlung (Federal Assembly) but was defeated by Horst Köhler who won 604 votes from the 1205 delegates.[13] On 26 May 2008, SPD chairman Kurt Beck announced Schwan's renewed nomination for the upcoming presidential elections in 2009.[14] Once again she competed with Horst Köhler, who announced his renewed candidacy on 22 May 2008.[15] In the event Köhler was re-elected to a second term over Schwan. Later political career[edit] In the 2019 SPD leadership election, Schwan announced her intention to run for the position as the party's co-chair, together with Ralf Stegner.[16] Other activities[edit] Einstein Forum, Member of the Board of Trustees[17] CARE Deutschland-Luxemburg, Member of the Board of Trustees[18] Theodor Heuss Foundation, Member of the Board of Trustees (since 1994) Technical University of Berlin, Member of the Board of Trustees (2018-2019)[19] Controversy[edit] Ahead of the 2009 presidential election, Schwan was criticized by the Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Records, Marianne Birthler, for statements on the political regime of East Germany. Reportedly, several electors from the Green Party refused to vote for Schwan due to her statements regarding the communist state.[20] Bibliography[edit] This list is incomplete; you can help by adding missing items.

Through its applied research, the Institute contributes to the debate on climate-related policies. It also publishes research to support financial institutions, businesses and local territories in the fight against climate change. I4CE is a registered non-profit organization, which was founded in 2015 by the French National Promotional Bank Caisse des Dépôts and the French Development Agency (AFD). Our research is made public and we aim for full transparency on the methods, sources and assumptions underlying our results. The Institute consists of a team of 30 people and has a budget of around 3 million euros. To find out more about I4CE: Annual report 2019/2020: combing economic recovery with the climate About I4CE’s Economics program The Institute is currently organized in four programs: Local territories, Financial institutions, Agriculture, food and forestry, and Economics. The purpose of the Economics program is to inform public decision-making regarding climate investments and the financing of the low-carbon transition. Specifically, it aims to support, through the development of innovative analyses, the debate on whether public policies are conducive to investments and structural changes which are in line with national climate objectives and low-carbon pathways. The current research workstreams of the Economics program are the following: Green budgeting & taxation Climate investments landscapes Post-Covid recovery plans The integration of social considerations in climate policies Over the past couple of years, I4CE has engaged with international partners in order to share and improve the methods and approaches it had developed in the French context. I4CE contributed in 2020 to the development, by the Caisse de Dépôt et de Gestion du Maroc, of a Climate Finance Landscape for Morocco, and it is currently engaged in a collaboration with AFD, the Inter–American Development Bank and the government of Costa Rica to inform the establishment of green budget tagging in this country and to support its budgetary transition. The Institute is also engaged in an international consortium following the impacts of green recovery plans on clean and fossil fuel energy consumption, and it is about to launch a project on social hotspots in green budgeting exercises. Role and Responsibilities: The candidate is expected to support and contribute to the development of research activities on these topics, either in multilateral forums or in partnership with developing countries. The position is aimed at an individual with 5 to 10 years of prior research activities and an MSc or PhD level of education. This position requires a strong knowledge of the economic issues pertaining to the low-carbon transition as well as expertise in economic analysis. Experience in a research organization or think tank working on climate-related considerations is desired. The precise skills and motivations expected are as follows: High motivation to work on economic issues pertaining to the implementation of the low carbon and resilient transition in international contexts. Excellent research and writing skills: An ability to come up with innovative and salient research questions; An ability to conceptualize a research issue and to design a methodological framework; An ability to apply advanced methods and do undertake rigorous research; An ability to produce high quality research outputs in formats which are adapted to the targeted audience; Autonomy and very good project management skills. A demonstrated ability to work in international environments: Development of funding requests and partnerships proposals with international organizations and donors; An ability to develop, implement and adapt a work program according to the international agenda; Fluency to deliver presentations and engage in English with high-level experts.

In order to help central banks to carry out this type of exercise, the NGFS published in 2020, its first guide to climate scenarios analysis that can be used in climate stress tests. NewsThe Next Step for Financial Institutions: Aligning the entire Financial Chain A core goal of the Paris Agreement is “make finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development.” Since 2015, financial institutions of all types – from development banks to asset owners and pension funds – have committed to making their portfolios ‘consistent’ with the Paris Agreement. PublicationClimate: a look back at 10 years of French government spending The episode of the yellow vests has highlighted the heart of the problem that climate action must solve: the State cannot simply set the rules and impose the path, it must also accompany households and businesses in the low-carbon transition. Accompanying means offering low-carbon mobility alternatives, for example, or financially supporting building renovations and the production of low-carbon energy.

I4CE aims to bring together, within a service of general interest, the skills required to provide independent advice on economic questions relating to energy and climate policies. It aims to contribute to the creation of conditions which can promote energy transition. Through both its applied and academic research, I4CE offers assistance to public and private sector decision makers, helping them to better understand, anticipate and use economic and financial instruments to encourage the development of a low carbon economy adapted to climate change. Incorporating the CDC Climat Recherche team, I4CE consists of some twenty researchers working on three areas of interest to those involved in energy transition: Industry, Energy and Climate The team’s previous work programme was established in 2005 and focused on carbon price rates and, in particular, the energy and industry sectors. For the 2015-2016 period, the flagship project focuses on the coordination of energy and climate policies (COPEC 2030). Supported by the public sector and the main French energy suppliers, the project aims to assess the 2020 energy and climate package in order to clarify the 2030 energy-climate package negotiations, involving measures which will constitute the EU’s ‘contribution’ to COP 21. The team also monitors carbon regulations and energy efficiency in some 40 countries, information which feeds back into occasional research on carbon pricing policies in specific countries. Territories and Climate This second programme focuses on climate policies and action on the regional level. The four working themes are agriculture, forestry, cities and adaptation to climate change. In addition to the three research ‘clubs’ working on agriculture, forestry and cities, which the team leads with key partners, several other research projects are underway. One of the main projects, known as Abstract-Colurba, examines the barriers to regional authorities’ adaptation strategies. Finance and climate Initiated in 2012, this research aims to facilitate the integration of climate into financial decision making. This series of projects also analyses the interaction between public policy (regulations, subsidies, support mechanisms, investment programmes) and private investment in energy transition. Recent and ongoing work includes: Landscape, a panorama of financial flows for energy transition, conducted to date in France; an analysis of the contribution of finance to energy transition by the five European public finance institutions; and an analysis of the climate practices of international sponsors. How we work Providing research and expertise I4CE conducts research and consultation projects on the French, European and international levels, with academic partners and think tanks and the financial support of private companies, public authorities and institutions. I4CE researchers publish around thirty publications per year including research reports, articles in peer-reviewed journals and expert reports. The team also promotes its expertise by conducting expert advisory missions, which aim to stimulate public decision making or to be widely disseminated. Building capacity The dissemination of information also includes the publication of information for non-specialists such as notes and booklets. I4CE experts also conduct research-action projects. Finally, they organise training for public and private sector decision makers. Contributing to public debates I4CE organises events to encourage interaction between the academic world and public and private sector decision makers. I4CE responds to public consultations issued by French, European and supranational institutions. I4CE experts participate in expert working groups on the French, European and international levels. Incorporating the CDC Climat Recherche team, which has been supported by the Caisse des Dépôts for the past ten years and which has now been joined by the Agence Française de Développement, I4CE is strengthening France’s role in economic research applied to climate change and increasing its international influence.

ICLEI provides technical consulting to local governments to meet sustainability objectives.[1] Founded in 1990 and formerly known as the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives, the international association was established when more than 200 local governments from 43 countries convened at its inaugural conference, the World Congress of Local Governments for a Sustainable Future, at the United Nations in New York in September 1990.[2] As of 2020, more than 1,750 cities, towns, counties, and their associations in 126 countries are a part of the ICLEI network.[3] As of 2021, ICLEI has more than 20 offices around the world. Contents 1 Membership 2 History and structure 3 Programs 4 Governance 5 Ecomobility 6 Criticism 7 ICLEI USA 8 References 9 External links Membership[edit] According to the organization's website, the ICLEI members ""steer the direction of our work, shape our strategy and support the mission, mandate and principles set in our statutes. They are eligible to vote and take part in our network-wide governing bodies.""[4] In 2009, ICLEI included 1,227 local government members worldwide in 70 countries, with more than 600 in the United States.[5] ICLEI USA membership grew by 58% in 2008[6] and by 25% in 2009.[7] U.S. local government members include cities, towns, and counties of all sizes, from New York City and Los Angeles County to Dubuque, Iowa and Arlington, Texas.[8] In 2020, ICLEI counts more that 1,750 local governments within its network. The only requirements for ICLEI membership are a self-defined commitment to climate protection and the payment of annual membership dues based on population size.[9] History and structure[edit] ICLEI was founded in 1990, with its World Secretariat headquartered in Toronto, Canada.[10] The U.S. office opened formally in 1995. ICLEI USA's Executive Office is based in Washington, D.C. and the World Secretariat is now in Bonn, Germany.[11] ICLEI was founded in 1990 as the ""International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives"". In 2003, ICLEI's local government members voted to revise the organization's mission, charter and name to better reflect the current challenges local governments face, and the broader topic of sustainability. The ""International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives"" thus became ""ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability"", with a broader mandate to address sustainability issues, not only environmental issues.[12][5] For its 30th anniversary, ICLEI adopted a new logo (released officially in February 2021) which emphasizes the organization's connections in terms of its members, offices and elements (represented by the logo's colors: water, air and climate (blue), nature (green) and cities (yellow)).[13] Programs[edit] The organization promotes the following programs for local-level adoption and implementation as described on their website. the Rio Conventions: The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, The UN Convention on Biological Diversity, The UN Convention to Combat Desertification Agenda 21 the Habitat Agenda the Millennium Development Goals the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation ICLEI also provides oversight for the Compact of Mayors, a global coalition of city leaders founded to address climate change at the local level,[14] as well as acting as the focal point for the Local Governments and Municipal Authorities (LGMA) Constituency, which has represented networks of local and regional governments at the UNFCCC process since 1995.[15] Governance[edit] Park Won-soon, President of ICLEI 2015-2018 ICLEI is a democratic organization led by the ICLEI Council and the Global Executive Committee (GexCom), two groups of local leaders elected by ICLEI Members every three years. The ICLEI Council is formed by the nine Regional Executive Committees (RexCom), elected by Members in each ICLEI region. One representative from each RexCom is then elected as a regional representative to the ICLEI Global Executive Committee (GexCom), along with portfolio holders who are elected to the GexCom by the members of the ICLEI Council based on their thematic expertise. The ICLEI GexCom and Council have the power to represent ICLEI on the global stage and steer the organization by setting ICLEI global strategy and policies.[16] The Council convenes every three years at an ICLEI World Congress and establishes ICLEI's priorities and direction through the adoption of a six-year Strategic Plan. The most recent ICLEI World Congress was held in Montreal from 19 to 22 June 2018. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the upcoming ICLEI World Congress will be held in two parts: the first one will be convened virtually from 13 to 15 April 2021, while the second one will take place in Malmö, Sweden in 2022. Members elect 21 representatives to serve on the Executive Committee, which oversees the implementation of the Strategic Plan and ICLEI operations.[16] World Secretariat directors:[17] Ashok Sridharan – ICLEI President and Mayor, Bonn, Germany Gino Van Begin – ICLEI Secretary General, Bonn, Germany Ecomobility[edit] See also: Global Alliance for EcoMobility Ecomobility means travelling through integrated, socially inclusive, and environmentally friendly transport options, including and integrating walking, cycling, public transport and other climate and people friendly innovative modes of transport. By enabling citizens and organizations to access goods, services, and information in a sustainable manner, ecomobility supports citizens' quality of life, increases travel choices, and promotes social cohesion. ICLEI's agenda promoting ecomobility in cities is titled the EcoMobile City (sustainable transport) Agenda. Under this agenda, ICLEI executes the following 3 key projects: EcoMobility Alliance EcoMobility World Festival EcoMobility World Congress The EcoMobility Alliance was created in October 2011 in Changwon, Korea. It is a transformation of the earlier Global Alliance for EcoMobility, which is a non-governmental organization founded and launched in Bali on 10 December 2007, on the occasion of the 2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference (UNFCCC-COP-13).[18][19] ICLEI legally represents and hosts the Secretariat of the Criticism[edit] Tea Party movement activists targeted ICLEI for its support for Agenda 21, a nonbinding United Nations initiative that seeks to promote resource and land conservation. The activists claimed that local government efforts to expand public transportation and preserve open space were part of a UN conspiracy plot ""to deny property rights and herd citizens toward cities"".[20] Dan Maes, the 2010 Republican candidate for Governor of Colorado, criticized the city of Denver for its membership in ICLEI during his campaign.[21] ICLEI USA[edit] The United States branch is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit membership organization of the international organization of the same name.[5] References[edit] ^ ""ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability .:.

We create systems change, developing integrated solutions along five interconnected development pathways that transform urban areas. ICLEI experts are on the ground, working alongside local and regional governments to anticipate and respond to complex challenges, from urbanization and climate change to ecosystem degradation and inequity. We invest in the capacity and knowledge needed to design solutions to these challenges and make decisions informed by data, scientific evidence and local realities and pressures. ICLEI leads knowledge exchange and sparks city-to-city and city-to-region connections worldwide. Peer exchange and capacity building are at the heart of what we do.  At the national and global scales, we push for robust policies that reflect the interests of local and regional governments and apply global policy to sustainable urban development strategies at the subnational level.ICLEI forms strategic alliances with international organizations, national governments, academic and financial institutions, civil society and the private sector. We create space for innovation and lead our partners to build new ways to support sustainable development at the urban scale.

Active in 100+ countries, ICLEI influence sustainability policy and drive local action for low emission, nature-based, equitable, resilient and circular development. The ICLEI network and team of experts work together through peer exchange, partnerships and capacity building to create systemic change for urban sustainability including addressing the need for reducing SLCPs. In line with the approach of forming strategic alliances and partnerships to reinforce sustainable urban development, ICLEI has been an active member of the CCAC since 2014 and committed to empower local and regional governments and their communities to take effective action on climate and air quality - tackling air pollution to safe levels by 2030. It is in this vane that ICLEI’s work within the CCAC and beyond generally hovers around the following priorities: As a focal point of the LGMA constituency of the UNFCCC, ICLEI works to create the enabling environment via stakeholder engagement, political advocacy and engendering multilevel governance for ambitious local action on climate change and air quality in cities, towns and regions; Raising awareness and increasing understanding of the urgency to reduce emission of climate forcers and air pollutants like methane, hydrofluorocarbons, black carbon and tropospheric ozone to meet the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C, as well as the WHO guideline of limiting fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the air to levels below 10 μg/m3 particularly in the near term; Building local capacities and offering ICLEI tools and methodologies, including the GHG inventory tool ClearPath and the CDP-ICLEI Unified Reporting System, to enable cities to track and report on their emission reduction targets, action plans, actions and performance. The Solutions Gateway as an online resource platform and the TAP hold promise to build local capacities and access financing for local action; Leveraging on the East Asia Clean Air Cities, a joint program by ICLEI and Seoul Metropolitan Government to accelerate local action on air pollution through regional multilateral cooperation, and further scaling up promotion to other cities and regions; Reaching out beyond the ICLEI network to other subnational governments at global events like the ICLEI World Congress 2021-22 and the Daring Cities fora, as well as other international conferences like the Climate COPs, etc. to raise awareness and share good practices and strategies.

ICLEI provides technical consulting to local governments to meet sustainability objectives.[1] Founded in 1990 and formerly known as the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives, the international association was established when more than 200 local governments from 43 countries convened at its inaugural conference, the World Congress of Local Governments for a Sustainable Future, at the United Nations in New York in September 1990.[2] As of 2020, more than 1,750 cities, towns, counties, and their associations in 126 countries are a part of the ICLEI network.[3] As of 2021, ICLEI has more than 20 offices around the world. Contents 1 Membership 2 History and structure 3 Programs 4 Governance 5 Ecomobility 6 Criticism 7 ICLEI USA 8 References 9 External links Membership[edit] According to the organization's website, the ICLEI members ""steer the direction of our work, shape our strategy and support the mission, mandate and principles set in our statutes. They are eligible to vote and take part in our network-wide governing bodies.""[4] In 2009, ICLEI included 1,227 local government members worldwide in 70 countries, with more than 600 in the United States.[5] ICLEI USA membership grew by 58% in 2008[6] and by 25% in 2009.[7] U.S. local government members include cities, towns, and counties of all sizes, from New York City and Los Angeles County to Dubuque, Iowa and Arlington, Texas.[8] In 2020, ICLEI counts more that 1,750 local governments within its network. The only requirements for ICLEI membership are a self-defined commitment to climate protection and the payment of annual membership dues based on population size.[9] History and structure[edit] ICLEI was founded in 1990, with its World Secretariat headquartered in Toronto, Canada.[10] The U.S. office opened formally in 1995. ICLEI USA's Executive Office is based in Washington, D.C. and the World Secretariat is now in Bonn, Germany.[11] ICLEI was founded in 1990 as the ""International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives"". In 2003, ICLEI's local government members voted to revise the organization's mission, charter and name to better reflect the current challenges local governments face, and the broader topic of sustainability. The ""International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives"" thus became ""ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability"", with a broader mandate to address sustainability issues, not only environmental issues.[12][5] For its 30th anniversary, ICLEI adopted a new logo (released officially in February 2021) which emphasizes the organization's connections in terms of its members, offices and elements (represented by the logo's colors: water, air and climate (blue), nature (green) and cities (yellow)).[13] Programs[edit] The organization promotes the following programs for local-level adoption and implementation as described on their website. the Rio Conventions: The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, The UN Convention on Biological Diversity, The UN Convention to Combat Desertification Agenda 21 the Habitat Agenda the Millennium Development Goals the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation ICLEI also provides oversight for the Compact of Mayors, a global coalition of city leaders founded to address climate change at the local level,[14] as well as acting as the focal point for the Local Governments and Municipal Authorities (LGMA) Constituency, which has represented networks of local and regional governments at the UNFCCC process since 1995.[15] Governance[edit] Park Won-soon, President of ICLEI 2015-2018 ICLEI is a democratic organization led by the ICLEI Council and the Global Executive Committee (GexCom), two groups of local leaders elected by ICLEI Members every three years. The ICLEI Council is formed by the nine Regional Executive Committees (RexCom), elected by Members in each ICLEI region. One representative from each RexCom is then elected as a regional representative to the ICLEI Global Executive Committee (GexCom), along with portfolio holders who are elected to the GexCom by the members of the ICLEI Council based on their thematic expertise. The ICLEI GexCom and Council have the power to represent ICLEI on the global stage and steer the organization by setting ICLEI global strategy and policies.[16] The Council convenes every three years at an ICLEI World Congress and establishes ICLEI's priorities and direction through the adoption of a six-year Strategic Plan. The most recent ICLEI World Congress was held in Montreal from 19 to 22 June 2018. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the upcoming ICLEI World Congress will be held in two parts: the first one will be convened virtually from 13 to 15 April 2021, while the second one will take place in Malmö, Sweden in 2022. Members elect 21 representatives to serve on the Executive Committee, which oversees the implementation of the Strategic Plan and ICLEI operations.[16] World Secretariat directors:[17] Ashok Sridharan – ICLEI President and Mayor, Bonn, Germany Gino Van Begin – ICLEI Secretary General, Bonn, Germany Ecomobility[edit] See also: Global Alliance for EcoMobility Ecomobility means travelling through integrated, socially inclusive, and environmentally friendly transport options, including and integrating walking, cycling, public transport and other climate and people friendly innovative modes of transport. By enabling citizens and organizations to access goods, services, and information in a sustainable manner, ecomobility supports citizens' quality of life, increases travel choices, and promotes social cohesion. ICLEI's agenda promoting ecomobility in cities is titled the EcoMobile City (sustainable transport) Agenda. Under this agenda, ICLEI executes the following 3 key projects: EcoMobility Alliance EcoMobility World Festival EcoMobility World Congress The EcoMobility Alliance was created in October 2011 in Changwon, Korea. It is a transformation of the earlier Global Alliance for EcoMobility, which is a non-governmental organization founded and launched in Bali on 10 December 2007, on the occasion of the 2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference (UNFCCC-COP-13).[18][19] ICLEI legally represents and hosts the Secretariat of the Criticism[edit] Tea Party movement activists targeted ICLEI for its support for Agenda 21, a nonbinding United Nations initiative that seeks to promote resource and land conservation. The activists claimed that local government efforts to expand public transportation and preserve open space were part of a UN conspiracy plot ""to deny property rights and herd citizens toward cities"".[20] Dan Maes, the 2010 Republican candidate for Governor of Colorado, criticized the city of Denver for its membership in ICLEI during his campaign.[21] ICLEI USA[edit] The United States branch is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit membership organization of the international organization of the same name.[5] References[edit] ^ ""ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability .:.

Low-Emissions Resilient Equitable & People-Centered Nature-Based Circular Testimonials ""ICLEI has helped tremendously with San Antonio’s greenhouse gas inventories. The team consistently goes above and beyond to ensure that our staff understands the process at each step of the way, offering to write summaries, notate and keep track of changes, and attend meetings and briefings as needed. From transferring our 2016 data from CIRIS to ClearPath, to entering the raw data for 2019, and offering recommendations and best practices, the assistance that was provided to our city and community is truly invaluable."" Minerva Defee Climate Program Manager, Office of Sustainability, San Antonio, TX ""Every community should undertake a climate vulnerability assessment and we feel privileged to have ICLEI's support as we launch ours. The assessment will help us plan for changing future conditions. It will also help us make investments now that will ensure the resiliency of our community after we are long gone.  Climate adaptation is not a choice—it is a duty!"" Nicola Armacost Mayor, Village of Hastings-on-Hudson, NY “It’s a huge challenge to coordinate a regional climate action plan. Each jurisdiction has different goals and priorities, and we’ve had to make a lot of adjustments throughout the process. ICLEI and SEEC have a lot of great resources. I relied a lot on the protocols and ClearPath guides."" Connor McGuigan Planner, Humboldt County, CA “Our ICLEI memberships have paid dividends far greater than the modest fees required. Beyond the rich library of research and tools to advance climate action, and the networking opportunities with like-minded counterparts in other municipalities; the technical assistance and expert guidance that we received from ICLEI allowed us to leverage internal resources to develop our first GHG inventories under the Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Inventories. With our baseline inventories archived in ClearPath, we are now using it to crunch our data and identify the most impactful strategies to reduce and eliminate carbon emissions. I look forward to increasing our utilization of ICLEI’s expanding capabilities.” Rocky Mould Energy Program Manager, Office of Climate Change, Sustainability and Resiliency, City and County of Honolulu, HI “ICLEI membership provides tools for future research, data collection and planning activities. ICLEI’s resources are widely used as the standard for collecting greenhouse gas emissions data and [ClearPath is] a tool that both Clallam County and Jefferson County have used.” Ken Dubuc Fire Chief, City of Port Angeles, WA ""ICLEI has been a strong partner for the City of Monterey as we work to finalize our Climate Action Plan and implement a wide-ranging suite of measures at the government and community level to reduce our carbon footprint."" Ted J. Terrasas REHS - Sustainability Coordinator, Monterey, CA ""ICLEI has been a vital resource to the City of Boynton Beach over the past 5 years as we continue to implement strategies from our Climate Action Plan. We have been provided with best practices, toolkits, templates, software and technical guidance through their website and friendly, knowledgeable staff.  Considering the cost we would have incurred for contracting with individual consultants and vendors, our ICLEI membership remains the best return on investment for our ongoing sustainability needs.""

Imperial grew out of Prince Albert's vision of an area for culture, including the Royal Albert Hall, Imperial Institute, numerous museums, and the Royal Colleges that would go on to form the college.[9][10] In 1907, Imperial College was established by Royal Charter, merging the Royal College of Science, Royal School of Mines, and City and Guilds College.[11] In 1988, the Imperial College School of Medicine was formed by combining with St Mary's Hospital Medical School. In 2004, Queen Elizabeth II opened the Imperial College Business School. The college focuses exclusively on science, technology, medicine and business. The college's main campus is located in South Kensington, and it has an innovation campus in White City, a research field station at Silwood Park, and teaching hospitals throughout London. The college was a member of the University of London from 1908, becoming independent on its centenary in 2007.[12][13] Imperial has an international community, with more than 59% of students from outside the UK and 140 countries represented on campus.[14][15] Student, staff, and researcher affiliations include 14 Nobel laureates, 3 Fields Medalists, 2 Breakthrough Prize winners, 1 Turing Award winner, 74 Fellows of the Royal Society, 87 Fellows of the Royal Academy of Engineering, and 85 Fellows of the Academy of Medical Sciences.[16] Contents 1 History 1.1 19th century 1.2 20th century 1.3 21st century 2 Campuses 2.1 South Kensington 2.2 White City 2.3 Silwood Park 2.4 Hospitals 3 Organisation and administration 3.1 Faculties and departments 3.2 Global institutes 3.3 Academic centres 3.4 Governance 3.5 Finances and endowment 3.6 Affiliations and partnerships 4 Academic profile 4.1 Rankings 4.2 Research 4.3 Admissions 4.4 Libraries 4.5 Medicine 5 Controversies 5.1 Accusations of bullying 6 Student life 6.1 Student body 6.2 Imperial College Union 6.3 Facilities 6.4 Student media 6.4.1 Imperial College Radio 6.4.2 Imperial College TV 6.4.3 Felix Newspaper 6.5 Student societies 6.5.1 Imperial College Boat Club 6.5.2 Sports 6.5.3 Exploration Club 6.5.4 Dramatic Society 6.5.5 The Techtonics 6.6 Student housing 7 Notable alumni, faculty and staff 8 See also 9 Notes 10 References 11 External links History[edit] Prince Albert was the main patron of the early Royal Colleges and the development of an area of culture in South Kensington Main article: History of Imperial College London 19th century[edit] The earliest college that led to the formation of Imperial was the Royal College of Chemistry, founded in 1845, with the support of Prince Albert and parliament.[10] This was merged in 1853 into what became known as the Royal School of Mines.[17] The medical school has roots in many different schools across London, the oldest of which being Charing Cross Hospital Medical School which can be traced back to 1823, followed by teaching starting at Westminster Hospital in 1834, and St Mary's Hospital in 1851.[18][19][20] In 1851, the Great Exhibition was organised as an exhibition of culture and industry by Henry Cole and by Prince Albert, husband of the reigning monarch of the United Kingdom, Queen Victoria. An enormously popular and financial success, proceeds from the Great Exhibition were designated to develop an area for cultural and scientific advancement in South Kensington.[21] Within the next 6 years the Victoria and Albert Museum and Science Museum had opened, joined by new facilities in 1871 for the Royal College of Chemistry and in 1881 for the Royal School of Mines, the opening of the Natural History Museum in 1881, and in 1888 the Imperial Institute.[22] Imperial Institute, now the site of Queen's Lawn In 1881, the Normal School of Science was established in South Kensington under the leadership of Thomas Huxley, taking over responsibility for the teaching of the natural sciences and agriculture from the Royal School of Mines.[23] The school was renamed the Royal College of Science by royal consent in 1890.[24] The Central Institution of the City and Guilds of London Institute, was opened as a technical education school on Exhibition Road by the Prince of Wales in early 1885.[11] Royal College of Science 20th century[edit] At the start of the 20th century, there was a concern that Britain was falling behind Germany in scientific and technical education. A departmental committee was set up at the Board of Education in 1904, to look into the future of the Royal College of Science. A report released in 1906 called for the establishment of an institution unifying the Royal College of Science and the Royal School of Mines, as well as – if an agreement could be reached with the City and Guilds of London Institute – their Central Technical College.[25][26] On 8 July 1907, King Edward VII granted a Royal Charter establishing the Imperial College of Science and Technology. This incorporated the Royal School of Mines and the Royal College of Science. It also made provisions for the City and Guilds College to join once conditions regarding its governance were met, as well as for Imperial to become a college of the University of London.[27] The college joined the University of London on 22 July 1908, with the City and Guilds College joining in 1910.[11][12] The main campus of Imperial College was constructed beside the buildings of the Imperial Institute, the new building for the Royal College of Science having opened across from it in 1906, and the foundation stone for the Royal School of Mines building being laid by King Edward VII in July 1909.[25] As students at Imperial had to study separately for London degrees, in January 1919, students and alumni voted for a petition to make Imperial a university with its own degree awarding powers, independent of the University of London.[28][29] In response, the University of London changed its regulations in 1925 so that the courses taught only at Imperial would be examined by the university, enabling students to gain a BSc.[30] Royal School of Mines In October 1945, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth visited Imperial to commemorate the centenary of the Royal College of Chemistry, which was the oldest of the institutions that united to form Imperial College. ""Commemoration Day"", named after this visit, is held every October as the university's main graduation ceremony.[31][32] The college also acquired a biology field station at Silwood Park near Ascot, Berkshire in 1947[33] Following the Second World War, there was again concern that Britain was falling behind in science – this time to the United States. The Percy Report of 1945 and Barlow Committee in 1946 called for a ""British MIT""-equivalent, backed by influential scientists as politicians of the time, including Lord Cherwell, Sir Lawrence Bragg and Sir Edward Appleton.[34][35] The University Grants Committee strongly opposed however,[34] and so a compromise was reached in 1953, where Imperial would remain within the university, but double in size over the next ten years.[36][37] The expansion led to a number of new buildings being erected. These included the Hill building in 1957 and the Physics building in 1960, and the completion of the East Quadrangle, built in four stages between 1959 and 1965. The building work also meant the demolition of the City and Guilds College building in 1962–63, and the Imperial Institute's building by 1967.[38] Opposition from the Royal Fine Arts Commission and others meant that Queen's Tower was retained, with work carried out between 1966 and 1968 to make it free standing.[39] New laboratories for biochemistry, established with the support of a £350,000 grant from the Wolfson Foundation, were opened by the Queen in 1965.[40][41] Queen Elizabeth II opening the Imperial College Business School In 1988, Imperial merged with St Mary's Hospital Medical School under the Imperial College Act 1988. Amendments to the royal charter changed the formal name of the institution to The Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine and made St Mary's a constituent college.[42] This was followed by mergers with the National Heart and Lung Institute in 1995 and the Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School, Royal Postgraduate Medical School and the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology in 1997, with the Imperial College Act 1997 formally establishing the Imperial College School of Medicine.[43] 21st century[edit] In 2003, Imperial was granted degree-awarding powers in its own right by the Privy Council. In 2004, the Imperial College Business School and a new main entrance on Exhibition Road were opened by Queen Elizabeth II.[44][45] The UK Energy Research Centre was also established in 2004 and opened its headquarters at Imperial. On 9 December 2005, Imperial announced that it would commence negotiations to secede from the University of London.[46] Imperial became fully independent of the University of London in July 2007.[13][47][48] In April 2011, Imperial and King's College London joined the UK Centre for Medical Research and Innovation as partners with a commitment of £40 million each to the project. The centre was later renamed the Francis Crick Institute and opened on 9 November 2016. It is the largest single biomedical laboratory in Europe. The college began moving into the new White City campus in 2016, with the launching of the Innovation Hub.[49] This was followed by the opening of the Molecular Sciences Research Hub for the Department of Chemistry, officially opened by Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan in 2019.[50] The White City campus also includes another biomedical centre funded by a £40 million donation by alumnus Sir Michael Uren.[51] Campuses[edit] Main entrance at South Kensington South Kensington[edit] Imperial's main campus is based in South Kensington. Notable buildings include the Royal College of Science, the Royal School of Mines, the Business School, and the Queen's Tower, which sits is at the heart of the campus. As part of Albertopolis, a cultural centre based on the vision of Prince Albert, the campus is surrounded by many of London's most popular cultural attractions including the Royal Albert Hall and Kensington Palace, museums including the Natural History Museum, Victoria and Albert Museum, and Science Museum, and institutions such as the Royal College of Art, the Royal College of Music, and the National Art Library.[52][53] The campus has many restaurants and cafés run by the college,[54] and contains much of the student accommodation, including the Prince's Garden Halls, and Beit Hall, home to the college union, which runs student pubs, a nightclub, and a cinema on site. To the north lie Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park, which are within easy walking distance from the college, and provide green spaces and sports facilities which many of the student clubs take advantage of.[55] White City Campus White City[edit] A second major campus has started opening in White City, to the west of the main campus, providing an innovation hub for the college, including research facilities and commercialisation space, as well as postgraduate accommodation.[56] The chemistry department moved much of its research to the new Molecular Sciences Research Hub on the campus in 2018,[50] with further departments and industry partners moving to the campus and surrounding area over the coming years.[57] The campus is also home to the Invention Rooms, a college hackerspace and community outreach centre.[58] The area hosts a number of biotechnology companies in the Imperial White City Incubator and the OpenCell biotech hub.[59][60] Silwood Park[edit] Silwood Park is a postgraduate campus of Imperial located in the village of Sunninghill near Ascot in Berkshire. The Silwood Park campus includes a centre for research and teaching in ecology, evolution, and conservation set in 100 ha of parkland where ecological field experiments are conducted, and contains student halls for students studying for a degree on the site. Hospitals[edit] Imperial has teaching hospitals across London which are used by the School of Medicine for undergraduate clinical teaching and medical research. All are based around college-affiliated hospitals, and also provide catering and sport facilities. College libraries are located on each campus, including the Fleming library at St Mary's.[61] Organisation and administration[edit] Faculties and departments[edit] Imperial is organised through a network of faculties and departments:[62] Faculty of Engineering Aeronautical Engineering Bioengineering Chemical Engineering Civil & Environmental Engineering Computing Dyson School of Design Engineering Earth Science & Engineering Electrical & Electronic Engineering Materials Mechanical Engineering Faculty of Natural Sciences Centre for Environmental Policy Chemistry Life Sciences Mathematics Physics Faculty of Medicine Brain Sciences Immunology and Inflammation Infectious Disease Metabolism, Digestion and Reproduction Surgery and Cancer Institute of Clinical Sciences National Heart and Lung Institute School of Public Health Imperial College Business School Finance Innovation & Entrepreneurship Management Brevan Howard Centre for Financial Analysis Global institutes[edit] Imperial hosts global centres to promote inter-disciplinary work: Energy Futures Laboratory Gandhi Centre for Inclusive Innovation Grantham Institute for Climate Change Institute for Security Science & Technology Centre for Health Economics & Policy Innovation Brevan Howard Centre for Financial Analysis & Technology Global Entrepreneurship & Development Index Data Science Institute Institute for Molecular Science and Engineering Institute of Global Health Innovation Francis Crick Institute Academic centres[edit] Imperial College also houses two academic centres, formerly the Department of Humanities, offering teaching to undergraduate and postgraduate students in modern languages, arts and humanities subjects, social sciences and other subjects which fall outside of the standard remit of science, technology and medicine. The aim of these centres is to provide training in study skills, such as the acquisition of English language proficiency, but also to encourage innovatory and interdisciplinary approaches to science, technology and medicine, which might make use of study of the arts, humanities, languages and social sciences. The academic centres are the: Centre for Academic English Centre for Languages, Culture and Communication The Centre for Languages, Culture and Communication also operates as Imperial College London's adult education centre, offering evening class courses in the arts, humanities, languages and sciences.[63] Governance[edit] Faculty Building, designed by Norman Foster See also: President of Imperial College London and Provost of Imperial College London The highest academic official of Imperial College London is the President, formerly known as the Rector. The President is the chief executive, elected by the Council of the college and Chairman of the Senate.[64] The position has been held by Alice Gast, an American chemical engineer, since September 2014.[65] In 2012, the additional post of Provost was created. James Stirling became the first Provost of Imperial College London in August 2013.[66] He was succeeded as Provost by Ian Walmsley in September 2018. The council is the governing body of Imperial, it consists of 23 members including the Chairman, the President, the Provost, the President of the Imperial College Union, 4 members of senior staff, and between 9 and 13 lay members who are not employees of Imperial. The current Chair is Sir Philip Dilley.[67] Finances and endowment[edit] Graduation ceremonies take place in the Royal Albert Hall In 2017/18, Imperial had a consolidated income of £1,033.0 million. It has the seventh largest endowment of any university in the United Kingdom, and the second largest of the universities in London.[68] The college's endowment is sub-divided into three distinct portfolios: Unitised Scheme – a unit trust vehicle for the college, Faculties and Departments to invest endowments and unfettered income to produce returns for the long term Non-Core Property – a portfolio containing around 120 operational and developmental properties which the college has determined are not core to the academic mission Strategic Asset Investments – containing the college's shareholding in Imperial Innovations and other restricted equity holdings.[68] Affiliations and partnerships[edit] Imperial is a member of the Association of Commonwealth Universities, European University Association, Global Alliance of Technological Universities, League of European Research Universities and the Russell Group. It is a founding member of the Imperial College academic health sciences centre, the Francis Crick Institute and MedCity. Imperial is a long-term partner of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, with the first formal large-scale collaboration agreement dating back to 1944 as part of the World War II scientific effort.[69] The two institutions still share a strong bond with exchange programs for their students and academic staff.[70][71] Academic profile[edit] Rankings[edit] RankingsNational rankingsComplete (2022)[72]5Guardian (2021)[73]9Times / Sunday Times (2021)[74]5Global rankingsARWU (2020)[75]25CWTS Leiden (2020)[76]21QS (2022)[77]7THE (2021)[78]11British Government assessmentTeaching Excellence Framework[79]Gold World & Europe Imperial is ranked 11th globally by the 2021 Times Higher Education World University Rankings,[80] as well as third in Europe and in the UK after Oxford and Cambridge in their 2019 European universities ranking.[81] Within the 2019 subject rankings, Imperial is ranked 4th globally in the clinical, pre-clinical and health category,[82] 11th in physical sciences,[83] 11th in computer science,[84] 12th in engineering and technology[85] and 14th in life sciences.[86] The college is ranked 7th worldwide by the 2022 QS World University Ranking,[87] as well as 3rd in Europe, and 1st in London.

University Guide in 2018.[95] As of 2018, The Guardian notes that Imperial graduates pick up the highest salaries in the UK in the first year after graduation, earning around a fifth more than students leaving Oxford and Cambridge.[96] A 2018 Department for Education report found that Imperial boosted female graduates earnings 31.3% above the average female graduate, and male graduates similarly saw a 25.3% increase in earnings above the average male graduate.[97] The 2019 Department for Education statistics found that 5 years after graduation Imperial mathematics and computing graduates were among the UK's ten highest income degrees.[98] The New York Times ranked Imperial College as one of the 10 most-welcomed universities by the global job market in 2012.[99] Research[edit] Electrical and Electronic Engineering Building, Dalby Court Imperial submitted a total of 1,257 staff across 14 units of assessment to the 2014 Research Excellence Framework (REF) assessment.[100] This found that 91% of Imperial's research is “world-leading” (46% achieved the highest possible 4* score) or “internationally excellent” (44% achieved 3*), giving an overall GPA of 3.36.[101][102] In rankings produced by Times Higher Education based upon the REF results Imperial was ranked 2nd overall.[101][102] Imperial is also widely known to have been a critical contributor of the discovery of penicillin,[103] the invention of fiber optics,[104] and the development of holography.[105] The college promotes research commercialisation, partly through its dedicated technology transfer company, Imperial Innovations, which has given rise to a large number of spin-out companies based on academic research.[106][107] Imperial College has a long-term partnership with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, that dates back from World War II.[69][70][71] The United States is the college's top collaborating foreign country, with more than 15,000 articles co-authored by Imperial and U.S.-based authors over the last 10 years.[108] In January 2018, the mathematics department of Imperial and the French National Center for Scientific Research launched UMI Abraham de Moivre at Imperial, a joint research laboratory of mathematics focused on unsolved problems and bridging British and French scientific communities.[109] The Fields medallists Cédric Villani and Martin Hairer hosted the launch presentation.[110] The CNRS-Imperial partnership started a joint PhD program in mathematics, and further expanded in June 2020 to include other departments.[111][112][113] In October 2018, Imperial College launched the Imperial Cancer Research UK Center, a research collaboration that aims to find innovative ways to improve the precision of cancer treatments, inaugurated by former Vice President of the United States Joe Biden as part of his Biden Cancer Initiative.[114][115] Imperial was one of the ten leading contributors to the NASA InSight Mars lander which landed on planet Mars in November 2018, with the college logo appearing on the craft.[116][117] InSight's Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure, developed at Imperial, measured the first likely marsquake reading in April 2019.[118][119][120] In 2019, it was revealed that the Blackett Laboratory would be constructing an instrument for the European Space Agency Solar Orbiter in a mission to study the Sun, which launched in February 2020.[121][122] The laboratory is also designing part of the US Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment.[123] In early 2020, immunology research at the Faculty of Medicine focused on SARS-CoV-2 under the leadership of Professor Robin Shattock as part of the college's COVID-19 Response Team, including the search of a cheap vaccine which started human trials on 15 June 2020.[124][125][126][127] Professor Neil Ferguson's 16 March report entitled ""Impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to reduce COVID- 19 mortality and healthcare demand""[128] was described in a 17 March The New York Times article, as the coronavirus ""report that jarred the U.S. and the U.K. to action"".[129] Since 18 May 2020, Imperial College's Dr. Samir Bhatt has been advising the state of New York for its reopening plan.[130] Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo said that ""the Imperial College model, as we've been following this for weeks, was the best, most accurate model.""[130] The hospitals from the Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, which have been caring for COVID-19 infected patients, partnered with Microsoft to use their HoloLens when treating those patients, reducing the amount of time spent by staff in high-risk areas by up to 83%, as well as saving up to 700 items of PPE per ward, per week.[131] Admissions[edit]

entry, the ratio of applicants to admissions was 8.5:1 for undergraduates and 7.2:1 for postgraduates.[135][136] For 2019 entry, the undergraduate courses with the lowest ratios of applicants to admissions were computing (19.7 applicants per place) followed by mechanical engineering (11.1:1) and mathematics (10.9:1).[135][136] The highest was bioengineering (3.6:1).[135][136] Undergraduates beginning their studies at Imperial in 2018–19 had the 5th highest average UCAS Tariff in the UK, at 190 points.[137] Imperial is among the most international universities in the United Kingdom,[138][139] with 50% of students from the UK, 16% of students from the EU, and 34% of students from outside the UK or EU.[138][140][141] The student body is 39% female and 61% male.[141] 36.5% of Imperial's undergraduates are privately educated, the fourth highest proportion amongst mainstream British universities.[139] Central Library on Queen's Lawn Libraries[edit] The college's Central Library is located next to Queen's Lawn and contains the main corpus of the college's collection. It previously also housed the Science Museum's library until 2014.[142] The Fleming library is located at St Mary's in Paddington, originally the library of St Mary's Hospital Medical School, with other hospital campuses also having college libraries.[143] Medicine[edit] Queen Elizabeth II opening the Alexander Fleming Building Main articles: Imperial College Faculty of Medicine and Imperial College Healthcare The Imperial Faculty of Medicine was formed through mergers between Imperial and the St Mary's, Charing Cross and Westminster, and Royal Postgraduate medical schools and has six teaching hospitals. It accepts more than 300 undergraduate medical students per year and has around 321 taught and 700 research full-time equivalent postgraduate students. Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust was formed on 1 October 2007 by the merger of Hammersmith Hospitals NHS Trust (Charing Cross Hospital, Hammersmith Hospital and Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital) and St Mary's NHS Trust (St. Mary's Hospital and Western Eye Hospital) with Imperial College London Faculty of Medicine.[144] It is an academic health science centre and manages five hospitals: Charing Cross Hospital, Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital, Hammersmith Hospital, St Mary's Hospital, and Western Eye Hospital. The Trust is currently one of the largest in the UK and in 2012/13 had a turnover of £971.3 million, employed approximately 9,770 people and treated almost 1.2 million patients.[145] Other (non-academic health science centres) hospitals affiliated with Imperial College include Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, Royal Brompton Hospital, West Middlesex University Hospital, Hillingdon Hospital, Mount Vernon Hospital, Harefield Hospital, Ealing Hospital, Central Middlesex Hospital, Northwick Park Hospital, St Mark's Hospital, St Charles' Hospital and St Peter's Hospital.[146] St Mary's Hospital Charing Cross Hospital Chelsea and Westminster Hospital Royal Brompton Hospital Hammersmith Hospital Controversies[edit] Accusations of bullying[edit] In 2003, it was reported that one third of female academics ""believe that discrimination or bullying by managers has held back their careers"".[147] Imperial has since won the Athena SWAN Award, which recognises employment practices that are supportive of the careers of women in science, technology, engineering and maths. In 2007, concerns were raised about the methods that were being used to fire people in the Faculty of Medicine.[148][149] In 2014, Stefan Grimm, of the Department of Medicine, was found dead after being threatened with dismissal for failure to raise enough grant money.[150] His last email before his death accused his employers of bullying by demanding that he should get grants worth at least £200,000 per year.[151][152] The college announced an internal inquiry into Stefan Grimm's death, and found that the performance metrics for his position were unreasonable, with new metrics for performance being needed.[153] The issue of bullying within the staff at Imperial resurfaced in November 2020 when Alex Sobel, the Labour MP for Leeds North West asked the Secretary of State for Education in a written question on 24 November what steps the Office for Students had taken in response to a report by Jane McNeill QC dated 25 August which found that bullying had taken place at Imperial under the President (Alice Gast) and the Chief Financial Officer. Michelle Donelan, the Conservative MP for Chippenham, responded for the Department for Education that ""The Office for Students (OfS) is considering the information it has received in relation to this matter, in line with their normal processes. As is standard practice, the OfS cannot comment on individual cases"".[154] The college was accused of a cover-up by the Universities and Colleges Union in December 2020 when it refused to publish McNeill's report, even in redacted form. The Chair of Council said that the report was kept confidential to preserve the anonymity of people who gave evidence, that its recommendations had been accepted by the senior leadership team, and that these recommendations were being implemented in full. A disciplinary panel decided that Gast's dismissal as president was not warranted and spokesperson for the college said that she had ""offered wholehearted apologies to those affected"".[155] On 14 February 2021, it was announced that the OfS would formally investigate allegations of bullying.[156] Student life[edit] Student body[edit] For the 2019/20 academic year, Imperial had a total full-time student body of 19,400, consisting of 10,475 undergraduate students and 8,925 postgraduates.[6] 50.7% of the student body is from outside of the UK.[157] 32% of all full-time students came from outside the European Union in 2013–14,[158] and around 13% of the International students had Chinese nationality in 2007–08.[159] Imperial's male to female ratio for undergraduate students is uneven at approximately 64:36 overall[159] and 5:1 or higher in some engineering courses. However, medicine has an approximate 1:1 ratio with biology degrees tending to be higher.[160] Queen's Lawn at South Kensington Campus Imperial College Union[edit] Imperial College Union is the students' union and is run by five full-time sabbatical officers elected from the student body for a tenure of one year, and a number of permanent members of staff. It is split into constituent unions aligned with the faculties of the college, carrying on the association with the original constituent colleges of Imperial, the Royal College of Science Union, City and Guilds College Union, Royal School of Mines Students' Union and Imperial College School of Medicine Students' Union. The Union is given a large subvention by the university, much of which is spent on maintaining over 300 clubs, projects and societies.[161] Examples of notable student groups and projects are Project Nepal which sends Imperial College students to work on educational development programmes in rural Nepal[162] and the El Salvador Project, a construction based project in Central America.[163] The Union also hosts sports-related clubs such as Imperial College Boat Club and Imperial College Gliding Club. The Union operates on two sites, with most events at the Union Building on Beit Quad at South Kensington, with mostly medical school events at the Reynold's bar, Charing Cross. Facilities[edit] Ethos Gym Sports facilities at Imperial's London campuses include four gyms, including the main Ethos gym at the South Kensington Campus, two swimming pools and two sports halls.[164] Imperial has additional sports facilities at the Heston and Harlington sports grounds. On the South Kensington campus, there are a total of six music practice rooms which consist of upright pianos for usage by people of any grade, and grand pianos which are exclusively for people who have achieved Grade 8 or above.[165] There are two student bars on the South Kensington campus, one at the Imperial College Union and one at Eastside.[166] There are a number of pubs and bars on campus and also surrounding the campus, which become a popular social activity for Imperial's students. The Pewter tankard collection at Imperial College Union is the largest in Europe, with the majority of clubs and societies having tankards associated with their clubs.[167] The weekly college farmer's market Student media[edit] Imperial College Radio[edit] Imperial College Radio (ICRadio) was founded in November 1975 with the intention of broadcasting to the student halls of residence from a studio under Southside, actually commencing broadcasts in late 1976. It now broadcasts from the West Basement of Beit Quad over the internet.[168] Imperial College TV[edit] Imperial College TV (ICTV) is Imperial College Union's TV station, founded in 1969 and operated from a small TV studio in the Electrical Engineering block. The department had bought an early AMPEX Type A 1-inch videotape recorder and this was used to produce an occasional short news programme which was then played to students by simply moving the VTR and a monitor into a common room. A cable link to the Southside halls of residence was laid in a tunnel under Exhibition Road in 1972. Besides the news, early productions included a film of the Queen opening what was then called College Block. Felix Newspaper[edit] Felix is weekly student newspaper, first released on 9 December 1949.[169] In addition to news, Felix also carries comic strips, features, opinions, puzzles and reviews, plus reports of trips and Imperial College sporting events. Student societies[edit] Racing Green Endurance is a student-led project to demonstrate the potential of zero-emission cars. Imperial College Boat Club[edit] The Imperial College Boat Club is the rowing club of Imperial and was founded on 12 December 1919. The college's boat house is located in Putney on the Thames, and was recently refurbished, reopening in 2014.[170] The club has a number of notable accolades, such as three alumni of the college in the gold medal winning GB 8+ at the 2000 Summer Olympic Games.[citation needed] Sports[edit] Imperial College has over 60 sports clubs,[171] of which many participate in the British Universities and Colleges Sport Association leagues such as American Football, Rugby, Badminton, Lacrosse, Football, Ice Hockey, and many others.[171] Exploration Club[edit] Imperial's Exploration Board was established in 1957 to assist students with a desire for exploration. Trips have included Afghanistan, Alaska, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Fiji, the Himalayas, Iran, Morocco, Norway, Tanzania, Thailand, Ukraine, and the Yukon.[172] Dramatic Society[edit] The Imperial College Dramatic Society (DramSoc[173]) is one of two major theatrical arts societies, with the other being the Musical Theatre Society, and it was founded in 1912.[174] The society puts on three major plays each year, in addition to several smaller fringe productions. It is additionally one of the London-based dramatic societies to participate in the London Student Drama Festival,[175] and regularly attends the Edinburgh Fringe. DramSoc is responsible for the day-to-day maintenance of the Union's theatrical space, the Union Concert Hall. The Techtonics[edit] The Techtonics are an all-male a cappella group from Imperial College London, and are a part of the Imperial College A Cappella Society.[176] The group was formed in 2008, and has since risen to prominence in the world a cappella scene. The group is best known for winning the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella in 2016.[177] Student housing[edit] Main article: Imperial College Halls of Residence Beit Hall Prince's Gardens in the snow, surrounded by college halls of residence Imperial College owns and manages twenty-three halls of residence in Inner London, Acton, and Ascot. Over three thousand rooms are available, guaranteeing first year undergraduates a place in College residences. The majority of halls offer single or twin accommodation with some rooms having en suite facilities. Bedrooms are provided with basic furniture and with access to shared kitchens and bathrooms. All rooms come with internet access and access to the Imperial network.[178] Most of them are considered among the newest student halls at London universities. Most students in college or university accommodation are first-year undergraduates, as they are granted a room once they have selected Imperial as their firm offer with UCAS. The majority of older students and postgraduates find accommodation in the private sector, help for which is provided by the college private housing office. However a handful of students may continue to live in halls in later years if they take the position of a ""hall senior"", and places are available for a small number of returning students in the Evelyn Garden halls.[179] Some students also live in International Students House, London.

Sohag’s journey began when he moved from Leeds to Keyleigh, a small town in Yorkshire, where he grew up in a Bangladeshi working-class family. Today he is one of our many brilliant teachers at Imperial Medicine We caught up with him in our final Shifting the Lens story ⬇️ ""Once I joined Imperial, I was somehow propelled to an unexpected level of celebrity in the School of Medicine. Students often stopped me, I put it down to the fact that I appeared to be very confident on stage even though I'm shy by nature. Also, I think the students weren't used to being taught by many young Asian teachers. I've tried to get over imposter syndrome by realising that I make a lot of effort in my job and that I deserve to be where I am. ""I’ve recently been promoted, and I now feel an even greater responsibility to play a role in making things better for our students. But a lot of it comes down to simple things. In my opinion, it’s about role models. Seeing people that have done it, that have achieved something, empowers others to do the same."" 👏🏾 Sohag's inspiring story is our final interview in this year’s Shifting the Lens series.

Latin (latīnum, [laˈt̪iːnʊ̃] or lingua latīna, [ˈlɪŋɡʷa laˈt̪iːna]) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. Latin was originally spoken in the area around Rome, known as Latium.[2] Through the power of the Roman Republic, it became the dominant language in Italy, and subsequently throughout the western Roman Empire, before eventually becoming a dead language. Latin has contributed many words to the English language. In particular, Latin (and Ancient Greek) roots are used in English descriptions of theology, the sciences, medicine, and law. By the late Roman Republic (75 BC), Old Latin had been standardised into Classical Latin. Vulgar Latin was the colloquial form spoken at that time and attested in inscriptions and the works of comic playwrights like Plautus and Terence[3] and author Petronius. Late Latin is the written language from the 3rd century; its colloquial form Vulgar Latin developed in the 6th to 9th centuries into the Romance languages, such as Italian, Sardinian, Venetian, Neapolitan, Sicilian, Piedmontese, Lombard, French, Franco-Provençal, Occitan, Corsican, Ladin, Friulan, Romansh, Catalan/Valencian, Aragonese, Spanish, Asturian, Galician, Portuguese and Romanian. Medieval Latin was used as a literary language from the 9th century to the Renaissance which used Renaissance Latin. Later, Early Modern Latin and New Latin evolved. Latin was the language of international communication, scholarship and science until well into the 18th century, when vernaculars (including the Romance languages) supplanted it. Ecclesiastical Latin remains the official language of the Holy See and the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church. Latin is a highly inflected language, with three distinct genders, six or seven noun cases, five declensions, four verb conjugations, six tenses, three persons, three moods, two voices, two or three aspects, and two numbers. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets and ultimately from the Phoenician alphabet.

There are no hard and fast rules of classification; different scholars emphasize different features. As a result, the list has variants, as well as alternative names. In addition to the historical phases, Ecclesiastical Latin refers to the styles used by the writers of the Roman Catholic Church from Late Antiquity onward, as well as by Protestant scholars. After the Western Roman Empire fell in 476 and Germanic kingdoms took its place, the Germanic people adopted Latin as a language more suitable for legal and other, more formal uses.[4] Old Latin[edit] Main article: Old Latin The Lapis Niger, probably the oldest extant Latin inscription, from Rome, c. 600 BC during the semi-legendary Roman Kingdom The earliest known form of Latin is Old Latin, which was spoken from the Roman Kingdom to the later part of the Roman Republic period. It is attested both in inscriptions and in some of the earliest extant Latin literary works, such as the comedies of Plautus and Terence. The Latin alphabet was devised from the Etruscan alphabet. The writing later changed from what was initially either a right-to-left or a boustrophedon[5][6] script to what ultimately became a strictly left-to-right script.[7] Classical Latin[edit] Main article: Classical Latin During the late republic and into the first years of the empire, a new Classical Latin arose, a conscious creation of the orators, poets, historians and other literate men, who wrote the great works of classical literature, which were taught in grammar and rhetoric schools. Today's instructional grammars trace their roots to such schools, which served as a sort of informal language academy dedicated to maintaining and perpetuating educated speech.[8][9] Vulgar Latin[edit] Main articles: Vulgar Latin, Late Latin, and Romance languages Philological analysis of Archaic Latin works, such as those of Plautus, which contain snippets of everyday speech, indicates that a spoken language, Vulgar Latin (termed sermo vulgi, ""the speech of the masses"", by Cicero), existed concurrently with literate Classical Latin. The informal language was rarely written, so philologists have been left with only individual words and phrases cited by classical authors and those found as graffiti.[10] As it was free to develop on its own, there is no reason to suppose that the speech was uniform either diachronically or geographically. On the contrary, romanised European populations developed their own dialects of the language, which eventually led to the differentiation of Romance languages.[11] The decline of the Roman Empire meant a deterioration in educational standards that brought about Late Latin, a postclassical stage of the language seen in Christian writings of the time. It was more in line with everyday speech, not only because of a decline in education but also because of a desire to spread the word to the masses.[citation needed] Despite dialectal variation, which is found in any widespread language, the languages of Spain, France, Portugal, and Italy retained a remarkable unity in phonological forms and developments, bolstered by the stabilising influence of their common Christian (Roman Catholic) culture. It was not until the Moorish conquest of Spain in 711, cutting off communications between the major Romance regions, that the languages began to diverge seriously.[12] The Vulgar Latin dialect that would later become Romanian diverged somewhat more from the other varieties, as it was largely separated from the unifying influences in the western part of the Empire. One key marker of whether a given Romance feature was found in Vulgar Latin is to compare it with its parallel in Classical Latin. If it was not preferred in Classical Latin, then it most likely came from the undocumented contemporaneous Vulgar Latin. For example, the Romance for ""horse"" (Italian cavallo, French cheval, Spanish caballo, Portuguese cavalo and Romanian cal) came from Latin caballus. However, Classical Latin used equus. Therefore, caballus was most likely the spoken form.[13] Vulgar Latin began to diverge into distinct languages by the 9th century at the latest, when the earliest extant Romance writings begin to appear. They were, throughout the period, confined to everyday speech, as Medieval Latin was used for writing.[14][15] Medieval Latin[edit] Main article: Medieval Latin The Latin Malmesbury Bible from 1407. Medieval Latin is the written Latin in use during that portion of the postclassical period when no corresponding Latin vernacular existed. The spoken language had developed into the various incipient Romance languages; however, in the educated and official world, Latin continued without its natural spoken base. Moreover, this Latin spread into lands that had never spoken Latin, such as the Germanic and Slavic nations. It became useful for international communication between the member states of the Holy Roman Empire and its allies. Without the institutions of the Roman empire that had supported its uniformity, medieval Latin lost its linguistic cohesion: for example, in classical Latin sum and eram are used as auxiliary verbs in the perfect and pluperfect passive, which are compound tenses. Medieval Latin might use fui and fueram instead.[16] Furthermore, the meanings of many words have been changed and new vocabularies have been introduced from the vernacular. Identifiable individual styles of classically incorrect Latin prevail.[16] Renaissance Latin[edit] Main article: Renaissance Latin Most 15th-century printed books (incunabula) were in Latin, with the vernacular languages playing only a secondary role.[17] The Renaissance briefly reinforced the position of Latin as a spoken language by its adoption by the Renaissance Humanists. Often led by members of the clergy, they were shocked by the accelerated dismantling of the vestiges of the classical world and the rapid loss of its literature. They strove to preserve what they could and restore Latin to what it had been and introduced the practice of producing revised editions of the literary works that remained by comparing surviving manuscripts. By no later than the 15th century they had replaced Medieval Latin with versions supported by the scholars of the rising universities, who attempted, by scholarship, to discover what the classical language had been.[18][14] New Latin[edit] Main article: New Latin During the Early Modern Age, Latin still was the most important language of culture in Europe. Therefore, until the end of the 17th century the majority of books and almost all diplomatic documents were written in Latin. Afterwards, most diplomatic documents were written in French (a Romance language) and later native or other languages. Contemporary Latin[edit] Main articles: Contemporary Latin and Ecclesiastical Latin Despite having no native speakers, Latin is still used for a variety of purposes in the contemporary world. Religious use[edit] The signs at Wallsend Metro station are in English and Latin, as a tribute to Wallsend's role as one of the outposts of the Roman Empire, as the eastern end of Hadrian's Wall (hence the name) at Segedunum. The largest organisation that retains Latin in official and quasi-official contexts is the Catholic Church. The Catholic Church required that Mass be carried out in Latin until the Second Vatican Council of 1962–1965, which permitted the use of the vernacular. Latin remains the language of the Roman Rite. The Tridentine Mass (also known as the Extraordinary Form or Traditional Latin Mass) is celebrated in Latin. Although the Mass of Paul VI (also known as the Ordinary Form or the Novus Ordo) is usually celebrated in the local vernacular language, it can be and often is said in Latin, in part or in whole, especially at multilingual gatherings. It is the official language of the Holy See, the primary language of its public journal, the Acta Apostolicae Sedis, and the working language of the Roman Rota. Vatican City is also home to the world's only automatic teller machine that gives instructions in Latin.[19] In the pontifical universities postgraduate courses of Canon law are taught in Latin, and papers are written in the same language. In the Anglican Church, after the publication of the Book of Common Prayer of 1559, a Latin edition was published in 1560 for use in universities such as Oxford and the leading ""public schools"" (English private academies), where the liturgy was still permitted to be conducted in Latin.[20] There have been several Latin translations since, including a Latin edition of the 1979 USA Anglican Book of Common Prayer.[21] The polyglot European Union has adopted Latin names in the logos of some of its institutions for the sake of linguistic compromise, an ""ecumenical nationalism"" common to most of the continent and as a sign of the continent's heritage (such as the EU Council: Consilium) Use of Latin for mottos[edit] In the Western world, many organizations, governments and schools use Latin for their mottos due to its association with formality, tradition, and the roots of Western culture.[22] Canada's motto A mari usque ad mare (""from sea to sea"") and most provincial mottos are also in Latin. The Canadian Victoria Cross is modelled after the British Victoria Cross which has the inscription ""For Valour"". Because Canada is officially bilingual, the Canadian medal has replaced the English inscription with the Latin Pro Valore. Spain's motto Plus ultra, meaning ""even further"", or figuratively ""Further!"", is also Latin in origin.[23] It is taken from the personal motto of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain (as Charles I), and is a reversal of the original phrase Non terrae plus ultra (""No land further beyond"", ""No further!""). According to legend, this inscribed as a warning on the Pillars of Hercules, the rocks on both sides of the Strait of Gibraltar and the western end of the known, Mediterranean world. Charles adopted the motto following the discovery of the New World by Columbus, and it also has metaphorical suggestions of taking risks and striving for excellence. Several states of the United States have Latin mottos, such as Connecticut's motto Qui transtulit sustinet (""He who transplanted sustains""); Kansas's Ad astra per aspera (""Through hardships, to the stars""); Colorado's Nil sine numine (""Nothing without providence""); Michigan's Si quaeris peninsulam amoenam, circumspice (""If you seek a pleasant peninsula, look about you""), is based on that of Sir Christopher Wren, in St. Paul's Cathedral; Missouri's Salus populi suprema lex esto (""The health of the people should be the highest law""); New York (state)'s Excelsior (""Ever upward""); North Carolina's Esse quam videri (""To be rather than to seem""); South Carolina's Dum spiro spero (""While [still] breathing, I hope""); Virginia's Sic semper tyrannis (""Thus always to tyrants""); and West Virginia's Montani semper liberi (""Mountaineers [are] always free""). Many military organizations today have Latin mottos, such as Semper paratus (""always ready""), the motto of the United States Coast Guard; Semper fidelis (""always faithful""), the motto of the United States Marine Corps; Semper Supra (“always above”), the motto of the United States Space Force; and Per ardua ad astra (""Through adversity/struggle to the stars""), the motto of the Royal Air Force (RAF). Some colleges and universities have adopted Latin mottos, for example Harvard University's motto is Veritas (""truth""). Veritas was the goddess of truth, a daughter of Saturn, and the mother of Virtue. Other modern uses[edit] Switzerland has adopted the country's Latin short name Helvetia on coins and stamps, since there is no room to use all of the nation's four official languages. For a similar reason, it adopted the international vehicle and internet code CH, which stands for Confœderatio Helvetica, the country's full Latin name. Some films of ancient settings, such as Sebastiane and The Passion of the Christ, have been made with dialogue in Latin for the sake of realism. Occasionally, Latin dialogue is used because of its association with religion or philosophy, in such film/television series as The Exorcist and Lost (""Jughead""). Subtitles are usually shown for the benefit of those who do not understand Latin. There are also songs written with Latin lyrics. The libretto for the opera-oratorio Oedipus rex by Igor Stravinsky is in Latin. The continued instruction of Latin is often seen as a highly valuable component of a liberal arts education. Latin is taught at many high schools, especially in Europe and the Americas. It is most common in British public schools and grammar schools, the Italian liceo classico and liceo scientifico, the German Humanistisches Gymnasium and the Dutch gymnasium. Occasionally, some media outlets, targeting enthusiasts, broadcast in Latin. Notable examples include Radio Bremen in Germany, YLE radio in Finland (the Nuntii Latini broadcast from 1989 until it was shut down in June 2019),[24] and Vatican Radio & Television, all of which broadcast news segments and other material in Latin.[25][26][27] A variety of organisations, as well as informal Latin 'circuli' ('circles'), have been founded in more recent times to support the use of spoken Latin.[28] Moreover, a number of university classics departments have began incorporating communicative pedagogies in their Latin courses. These include the University of Kentucky, the University of Oxford and also Princeton University.[29][30][31] There are many websites and forums maintained in Latin by enthusiasts. The Latin Wikipedia has more than 100,000 articles. Legacy[edit] Italian, French, Portuguese, Spanish, Romanian, Catalan, Romansh, and other Romance languages are direct descendants of Latin. There are also many Latin derivatives in English as well as a few in German, Dutch, Norwegian, Danish, and Swedish. Latin is still spoken in Vatican City, a city-state situated in Rome that is the seat of the Catholic Church. Inscriptions[edit] Some inscriptions have been published in an internationally agreed, monumental, multivolume series, the Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum (CIL). Authors and publishers vary, but the format is about the same: volumes detailing inscriptions with a critical apparatus stating the provenance and relevant information. The reading and interpretation of these inscriptions is the subject matter of the field of epigraphy. About 270,000 inscriptions are known. Literature[edit] Julius Caesar's Commentarii de Bello Gallico is one of the most famous classical Latin texts of the Golden Age of Latin. The unvarnished, journalistic style of this patrician general has long been taught as a model of the urbane Latin officially spoken and written in the floruit of the Roman Republic. The works of several hundred ancient authors who wrote in Latin have survived in whole or in part, in substantial works or in fragments to be analyzed in philology. They are in part the subject matter of the field of classics. Their works were published in manuscript form before the invention of printing and are now published in carefully annotated printed editions, such as the Loeb Classical Library, published by Harvard University Press, or the Oxford Classical Texts, published by Oxford University Press. Latin translations of modern literature such as The Hobbit, Treasure Island, Robinson Crusoe, Paddington Bear, Winnie the Pooh, The Adventures of Tintin, Asterix, Harry Potter, Le Petit Prince, Max and Moritz, How the Grinch Stole Christmas!, The Cat in the Hat, and a book of fairy tales, ""fabulae mirabiles"", are intended to garner popular interest in the language. Additional resources include phrasebooks and resources for rendering everyday phrases and concepts into Latin, such as Meissner's Latin Phrasebook. Influence on present-day languages[edit] The Latin influence in English has been significant at all stages of its insular development. In the Middle Ages, borrowing from Latin occurred from ecclesiastical usage established by Saint Augustine of Canterbury in the 6th century or indirectly after the Norman Conquest, through the Anglo-Norman language. From the 16th to the 18th centuries, English writers cobbled together huge numbers of new words from Latin and Greek words, dubbed ""inkhorn terms"", as if they had spilled from a pot of ink. Many of these words were used once by the author and then forgotten, but some useful ones survived, such as 'imbibe' and 'extrapolate'. Many of the most common polysyllabic English words are of Latin origin through the medium of Old French. Romance words make respectively 59%, 20% and 14% of English, German and Dutch vocabularies.[32][33][34] Those figures can rise dramatically when only non-compound and non-derived words are included. The influence of Roman governance and Roman technology on the less-developed nations under Roman dominion led to the adoption of Latin phraseology in some specialized areas, such as science, technology, medicine, and law. For example, the Linnaean system of plant and animal classification was heavily influenced by Historia Naturalis, an encyclopedia of people, places, plants, animals, and things published by Pliny the Elder. Roman medicine, recorded in the works of such physicians as Galen, established that today's medical terminology would be primarily derived from Latin and Greek words, the Greek being filtered through the Latin. Roman engineering had the same effect on scientific terminology as a whole. Latin law principles have survived partly in a long list of Latin legal terms. A few international auxiliary languages have been heavily influenced by Latin. Interlingua is sometimes considered a simplified, modern version of the language.[dubious – discuss] Latino sine Flexione, popular in the early 20th century, is Latin with its inflections stripped away, among other grammatical changes. The Logudorese dialect of the Sardinian language is the closest contemporary language to Latin.[35] Education[edit] A multivolume Latin dictionary in the University of Graz Library in Austria. Throughout European history, an education in the classics was considered crucial for those who wished to join literate circles. Instruction in Latin is an essential aspect. In today's world, a large number of Latin students in the US learn from Wheelock's Latin: The Classic Introductory Latin Course, Based on Ancient Authors. This book, first published in 1956,[36] was written by Frederic M. Wheelock, who received a PhD from Harvard University. Wheelock's Latin has become the standard text for many American introductory Latin courses. The Living Latin movement attempts to teach Latin in the same way that living languages are taught, as a means of both spoken and written communication. It is available in Vatican City and at some institutions in the US, such as the University of Kentucky and Iowa State University. The British Cambridge University Press is a major supplier of Latin textbooks for all levels, such as the Cambridge Latin Course series. It has also published a subseries of children's texts in Latin by Bell & Forte, which recounts the adventures of a mouse called Minimus. Latin and Ancient Greek at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, 2014. In the United Kingdom, the Classical Association encourages the study of antiquity through various means, such as publications and grants. The University of Cambridge,[37] the Open University,[38] a number of prestigious independent schools, for example Eton, Harrow, Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School, Merchant Taylors' School, and Rugby, and The Latin Programme/Via Facilis,[39] a London-based charity, run Latin courses. In the United States and in Canada, the American Classical League supports every effort to further the study of classics. Its subsidiaries include the National Junior Classical League (with more than 50,000 members), which encourages high school students to pursue the study of Latin, and the National Senior Classical League, which encourages students to continue their study of the classics into college. The league also sponsors the National Latin Exam. Classicist Mary Beard wrote in The Times Literary Supplement in 2006 that the reason for learning Latin is because of what was written in it.[40] Official status[edit] Latin was or is the official language of European states: Hungary – Latin was an official language in the Kingdom of Hungary from the 11th century to the mid 19th century, when Hungarian became the exclusive official language in 1844. The best known Latin language poet of Croatian-Hungarian origin was Janus Pannonius. Croatia – Latin was the official language of Croatian Parliament (Sabor) from the 13th to the 19th century (1847). The oldest preserved records of the parliamentary sessions (Congregatio Regni totius Sclavonie generalis) – held in Zagreb (Zagabria), Croatia – date from 19 April 1273. An extensive Croatian Latin literature exists. Latin is still used on Croatian coins on even years.[41] Poland, Kingdom of Poland – officially recognised and widely used[42][43][44][45] between the 10th and 18th centuries, commonly used in foreign relations and popular as a second language among some of the nobility.[45] Phonology[edit] Main article: Latin phonology and orthography The ancient pronunciation of Latin has been reconstructed; among the data used for reconstruction are explicit statements about pronunciation by ancient authors, misspellings, puns, ancient etymologies, the spelling of Latin loanwords in other languages, and the historical development of Romance languages.[46] Consonants[edit] The consonant phonemes of Classical Latin are as follows:[47] Labial Dental Palatal Velar Glottal plain labial Plosive voiced b d ɡ ɡʷ voiceless p t k kʷ Fricative voiced (z) voiceless f s h Nasal m n (ŋ) Rhotic r Approximant l j w /z/ was not native to Classical Latin. It appeared in Greek loanwords starting around the first century BC, when it was probably pronounced [z] initially and doubled [zz] between vowels, in contrast to Classical Greek [dz] or [zd]. In Classical Latin poetry, the letter ⟨z⟩ between vowels always counts as two consonants for metrical purposes.[48][49] The consonant ⟨b⟩ usually sounds as [b]; however, when ⟨t⟩ or ⟨s⟩ precedes ⟨b⟩ then it is pronounced as in [pt] or [ps]. Further, consonants do not blend together. So, ⟨ch⟩, ⟨ph⟩, and ⟨th⟩ are all sounds that would be pronounced as [kh], [ph], and [th]. In Latin, ⟨q⟩ is always followed by the vowel ⟨u⟩. Together they make a [kw] sound.[50] In Old and Classical Latin, the Latin alphabet had no distinction between uppercase and lowercase, and the letters ⟨J U W⟩ did not exist. In place of ⟨J U⟩, ⟨I V⟩ were used, respectively; ⟨I V⟩ represented both vowels and consonants. Most of the letterforms were similar to modern uppercase, as can be seen in the inscription from the Colosseum shown at the top of the article. The spelling systems used in Latin dictionaries and modern editions of Latin texts, however, normally use ⟨j u⟩ in place of Classical-era ⟨i v⟩. Some systems use ⟨j v⟩ for the consonant sounds /j w/ except in the combinations ⟨gu su qu⟩ for which ⟨v⟩ is never used. Some notes concerning the mapping of Latin phonemes to English graphemes are given below: Notes Latingrapheme Latinphoneme English examples ⟨c⟩, ⟨k⟩ [k] Always as k in sky (/skaɪ/) ⟨t⟩ [t] As t in stay (/steɪ/) ⟨s⟩ [s] As s in say (/seɪ/) ⟨g⟩ [ɡ] Always as g in good (/ɡʊd/) [ŋ] Before ⟨n⟩, as ng in sing (/sɪŋ/) ⟨n⟩ [n] As n in man (/mæn/) [ŋ] Before ⟨c⟩, ⟨x⟩, and ⟨g⟩, as ng in sing (/sɪŋ/) ⟨l⟩ [l] When doubled ⟨ll⟩ and before ⟨i⟩, as ""light L"", [l̥] in link ([l̥ɪnk]) (l exilis)[51][52] [ɫ] In all other positions, as ""dark L"", [ɫ] in bowl ([boʊɫ]) (l pinguis) ⟨qu⟩ [kʷ] Similar to qu in quick (/kwɪk/) ⟨u⟩ [w] Sometimes at the beginning of a syllable, or after ⟨g⟩ and ⟨s⟩, as /w/ in wine (/waɪn/) ⟨i⟩ [j] Sometimes at the beginning of a syllable, as y (/j/) in yard (/jaɹd/) [ij] ""y"" (/j/), in between vowels, becomes ""i-y"", being pronounced as parts of two separate syllables, as in capiō (/kapiˈjo:/) ⟨x⟩ [ks] A letter representing ⟨c⟩ + ⟨s⟩: as x in English axe (/æks/) In Classical Latin, as in modern Italian, double consonant letters were pronounced as long consonant sounds distinct from short versions of the same consonants. Thus the nn in Classical Latin annus ""year"" (and in Italian anno) is pronounced as a doubled /nn/ as in English unnamed. (In English, distinctive consonant length or doubling occurs only at the boundary between two words or morphemes, as in that example.) Vowels[edit] Simple vowels[edit] Front Central Back Close iː ɪ ʊ uː Mid eː ɛ ɔ oː Open a aː In Classical Latin, ⟨U⟩ did not exist as a letter distinct from V; the written form ⟨V⟩ was used to represent both a vowel and a consonant. ⟨Y⟩ was adopted to represent upsilon in loanwords from Greek, but it was pronounced like ⟨u⟩ and ⟨i⟩ by some speakers. It was also used in native Latin words by confusion with Greek words of similar meaning, such as sylva and ὕλη. Classical Latin distinguished between long and short vowels. Then, long vowels, except for ⟨I⟩, were frequently marked using the apex, which was sometimes similar to an acute accent ⟨Á É Ó V́ Ý⟩. Long /iː/ was written using a taller version of ⟨I⟩, called i longa ""long I"": ⟨ꟾ⟩. In modern texts, long vowels are often indicated by a macron ⟨ā ē ī ō ū⟩, and short vowels are usually unmarked except when it is necessary to distinguish between words, when they are marked with a breve ⟨ă ĕ ĭ ŏ ŭ⟩. However, they would also signify a long vowel by writing the vowel larger than other letters in a word or by repeating the vowel twice in a row.[50] The acute accent, when it is used in modern Latin texts, indicates stress, as in Spanish, rather than length. Long vowels in Classical Latin are, technically, pronounced as entirely different from short vowels. The difference is described in the table below: Pronunciation of Latin vowels Latingrapheme Latinphone modern examples ⟨a⟩ [a] similar to the last a in part (/paɹt/) [aː] similar to a in father (/fɑːðəɹ/) ⟨e⟩ [ɛ] as e in pet (/pɛt/) [eː] similar to e in hey (/heɪ/) ⟨i⟩ [ɪ] as i in pit (/pɪt/) [iː] similar to i in machine (/məʃiːn/) ⟨o⟩ [ɔ] as o in port (/pɔɹt/) [oː] similar to o in post (/poʊst/) ⟨u⟩ [ʊ] as u in put (/pʊt/) [uː] similar to ue in true (/tɹuː/) ⟨y⟩ [ʏ] does not exist in English; as ü in German Stück (/ʃtʏk/) [yː] does not exist in English; as üh in German früh (/fʀyː/) This difference in quality is posited by W. Sidney Allen in his book Vox Latina. However, Andrea Calabrese has disputed that short vowels differed in quality from long vowels, based upon the observation that [ɪ] and [ʊ] do not exist even in very conservative Romance languages such as Sardinian, with the difference in vowel quality more associated with Germanic languages. A vowel letter followed by ⟨m⟩ at the end of a word, or a vowel letter followed by ⟨n⟩ before ⟨s⟩ or ⟨f⟩, represented a long nasal vowel, as in monstrum [mõːstrũː]. Diphthongs[edit] Classical Latin had several diphthongs. The two most common were ⟨ae au⟩. ⟨oe⟩ was fairly rare, and ⟨ui eu ei⟩ were very rare, at least in native Latin words.[53] There has also been debate over whether ⟨ui⟩ is truly a diphthong in Classical Latin, due to its rarity, absence in works of Roman grammarians, and the roots of Classical Latin words (i.e. hui ce to huic, quoi to cui, etc.) not matching or being similar to the pronunciation of classical words if ⟨ui⟩ were to be considered a diphthong.[54] The sequences sometimes did not represent diphthongs. ⟨ae⟩ and ⟨oe⟩ also represented a sequence of two vowels in different syllables in aēnus [aˈeː.nʊs] ""of bronze"" and coēpit [kɔˈeː.pɪt] ""began"", and ⟨au ui eu ei ou⟩ represented sequences of two vowels or of a vowel and one of the semivowels /j w/, in cavē [ˈka.weː] ""beware!"", cuius [ˈkʊj.jʊs] ""whose"", monuī [ˈmɔn.ʊ.iː] ""I warned"", solvī [ˈsɔɫ.wiː] ""I released"", dēlēvī [deːˈleː.wiː] ""I destroyed"", eius [ˈɛj.jʊs] ""his"", and novus [ˈnɔ.wʊs] ""new"". Old Latin had more diphthongs, but most of them changed into long vowels in Classical Latin. The Old Latin diphthong ⟨ai⟩ and the sequence ⟨āī⟩ became Classical ⟨ae⟩. Old Latin ⟨oi⟩ and ⟨ou⟩ changed to Classical ⟨ū⟩, except in a few words whose ⟨oi⟩ became Classical ⟨oe⟩. These two developments sometimes occurred in different words from the same root: for instance, Classical poena ""punishment"" and pūnīre ""to punish"".[53] Early Old Latin ⟨ei⟩ usually changed to Classical ⟨ī⟩.[55] In Vulgar Latin and the Romance languages, ⟨ae oe⟩ merged with ⟨e ē⟩. During the Classical Latin period this form of speaking was deliberately avoided by well-educated speakers.[53] Diphthongs classified by beginning sound Front Back Close ui /ui̯/ Mid ei /ei̯/eu/eu̯/ oe /oe̯/ou /ou̯/ Open ae /ae̯/au /au̯/ Syllables[edit] Syllables in Latin are signified by the presence of diphthongs and vowels. The number of syllables is the same as the number of vowel sounds.[50] Further, if a consonant separates two vowels, it will go into the syllable of the second vowel. When there are two consonants between vowels, the last consonant will go with the second vowel. An exception occurs when a phonetic stop and liquid come together. In this situation, they are thought to be a single consonant, and as such, they will go into the syllable of the second vowel.[50] Length[edit] Syllables in Latin are considered either long or short. Within a word, a syllable may either be long by nature or long by position.[50] A syllable is long by nature if it has a diphthong or a long vowel. On the other hand, a syllable is long by position if the vowel is followed by more than one consonant.[50] Stress[edit] There are two rules that define which syllable is stressed in the Latin language.[50] In a word with only two syllables, the emphasis will be on the first syllable. In a word with more than two syllables, there are two cases. If the second-to-last syllable is long, that syllable will have stress. If the second-to-last syllable is not long, the syllable before that one will be stressed instead.[50] Orthography[edit] Main article: Latin alphabet The Duenos Inscription, from the 6th century BC, is one of the earliest known Old Latin texts. It was found on the Quirinal Hill in Rome. Latin was written in the Latin alphabet, derived from the Etruscan alphabet, which was in turn drawn from the Greek alphabet and ultimately the Phoenician alphabet.[56] This alphabet has continued to be used over the centuries as the script for the Romance, Celtic, Germanic, Baltic, Finnic, and many Slavic languages (Polish, Slovak, Slovene, Croatian, Bosnian and Czech); and it has been adopted by many languages around the world, including Vietnamese, the Austronesian languages, many Turkic languages, and most languages in sub-Saharan Africa, the Americas, and Oceania, making it by far the world's single most widely used writing system. The number of letters in the Latin alphabet has varied. When it was first derived from the Etruscan alphabet, it contained only 21 letters.[57] Later, G was added to represent /ɡ/, which had previously been spelled C, and Z ceased to be included in the alphabet, as the language then had no voiced alveolar fricative.[58] The letters Y and Z were later added to represent Greek letters, upsilon and zeta respectively, in Greek loanwords.[58] W was created in the 11th century from VV. It represented /w/ in Germanic languages, not Latin, which still uses V for the purpose. J was distinguished from the original I only during the late Middle Ages, as was the letter U from V.[58] Although some Latin dictionaries use J, it is rarely used for Latin text, as it was not used in classical times, but many other languages use it. Classical Latin did not contain sentence punctuation, letter case,[59] or interword spacing, but apices were sometimes used to distinguish length in vowels and the interpunct was used at times to separate words. The first line of Catullus 3, originally written as lv́géteóveneréscupꟾdinésqve (""Mourn, O Venuses and Cupids"") or with interpunct as lv́géte·ó·venerés·cupꟾdinésqve would be rendered in a modern edition as Lugete, o Veneres Cupidinesque or with macrons Lūgēte, ō Venerēs Cupīdinēsque or with apices Lúgéte, ó Venerés Cupídinésque. A modern Latin text written in the Old Roman Cursive inspired by the Vindolanda tablets, the oldest surviving handwritten documents in Britain. The word Romani ('Romans') is at bottom left. The Roman cursive script is commonly found on the many wax tablets excavated at sites such as forts, an especially extensive set having been discovered at Vindolanda on Hadrian's Wall in Britain. Most notable is the fact that while most of the Vindolanda tablets show spaces between words, spaces were avoided in monumental inscriptions from that era. Alternative scripts[edit] Occasionally, Latin has been written in other scripts: The Praeneste fibula is a 7th-century BC pin with an Old Latin inscription written using the Etruscan script. The rear panel of the early 8th-century Franks Casket has an inscription that switches from Old English in Anglo-Saxon runes to Latin in Latin script and to Latin in runes. Grammar[edit] Main articles: Latin grammar and Latin syntax Latin is a synthetic, fusional language in the terminology of linguistic typology. In more traditional terminology, it is an inflected language, but typologists are apt to say ""inflecting"". Words include an objective semantic element and markers specifying the grammatical use of the word. The fusion of root meaning and markers produces very compact sentence elements: amō, ""I love,"" is produced from a semantic element, ama-, ""love,"" to which -ō, a first person singular marker, is suffixed. The grammatical function can be changed by changing the markers: the word is ""inflected"" to express different grammatical functions, but the semantic element usually does not change. (Inflection uses affixing and infixing. Affixing is prefixing and suffixing. Latin inflections are never prefixed.) For example, amābit, ""he (or she or it) will love"", is formed from the same stem, amā-, to which a future tense marker, -bi-, is suffixed, and a third person singular marker, -t, is suffixed. There is an inherent ambiguity: -t may denote more than one grammatical category: masculine, feminine, or neuter gender. A major task in understanding Latin phrases and clauses is to clarify such ambiguities by an analysis of context. All natural languages contain ambiguities of one sort or another. The inflections express gender, number, and case in adjectives, nouns, and pronouns, a process called declension. Markers are also attached to fixed stems of verbs, to denote person, number, tense, voice, mood, and aspect, a process called conjugation. Some words are uninflected and undergo neither process, such as adverbs, prepositions, and interjections. Nouns[edit] Main article: Latin declension A regular Latin noun belongs to one of five main declensions, a group of nouns with similar inflected forms. The declensions are identified by the genitive singular form of the noun. The first declension, with a predominant ending letter of a, is signified by the genitive singular ending of -ae. The second declension, with a predominant ending letter of us, is signified by the genitive singular ending of -i. The third declension, with a predominant ending letter of i, is signified by the genitive singular ending of -is. The fourth declension, with a predominant ending letter of u, is signified by the genitive singular ending of -ūs. The fifth declension, with a predominant ending letter of e, is signified by the genitive singular ending of -ei. There are seven Latin noun cases, which also apply to adjectives and pronouns and mark a noun's syntactic role in the sentence by means of inflections. Thus, word order is not as important in Latin as it is in English, which is less inflected. The general structure and word order of a Latin sentence can therefore vary. The cases are as follows: Nominative – used when the noun is the subject or a predicate nominative. The thing or person acting: the girl ran: puella cucurrit, or cucurrit puella Genitive – used when the noun is the possessor of or connected with an object: ""the horse of the man"", or ""the man's horse""; in both instances, the word man would be in the genitive case when it is translated into Latin. It also indicates the partitive, in which the material is quantified: ""a group of people""; ""a number of gifts"": people and gifts would be in the genitive case. Some nouns are genitive with special verbs and adjectives: The cup is full of wine. (Poculum plēnum vīnī est.) The master of the slave had beaten him. (Dominus servī eum verberāverat.) Dative – used when the noun is the indirect object of the sentence, with special verbs, with certain prepositions, and if it is used as agent, reference, or even possessor: The merchant hands the stola to the woman. (Mercātor fēminae stolam trādit.) Accusative – used when the noun is the direct object of the subject and as the object of a preposition demonstrating place to which.: The man killed the boy. (Vir puerum necāvit.) Ablative – used when the noun demonstrates separation or movement from a source, cause, agent or instrument or when the noun is used as the object of certain prepositions; adverbial: You walked with the boy. (Cum puerō ambulāvistī.) Vocative – used when the noun is used in a direct address. The vocative form of a noun is often the same as the nominative, with the exception of second-declension nouns ending in -us. The -us becomes an -e in the vocative singular. If it ends in -ius (such as fīlius), the ending is just -ī (filī), as distinct from the nominative plural (filiī) in the vocative singular: ""Master!"" shouted the slave. (""Domine!"" clāmāvit servus.) Locative – used to indicate a location (corresponding to the English ""in"" or ""at""). It is far less common than the other six cases of Latin nouns and usually applies to cities and small towns and islands along with a few common nouns, such as the words domus (house), humus (ground), and rus (country). In the singular of the first and second declensions, its form coincides with the genitive (Roma becomes Romae, ""in Rome""). In the plural of all declensions and the singular of the other declensions, it coincides with the ablative (Athēnae becomes Athēnīs, ""at Athens""). In the fourth-declension word domus, the locative form, domī (""at home"") differs from the standard form of all other cases. Latin lacks both definite and indefinite articles so puer currit can mean either ""the boy is running"" or ""a boy is running"". Adjectives[edit] Main article: Latin declension § Adjectives There are two types of regular Latin adjectives: first- and second-declension and third-declension. They are so-called because their forms are similar or identical to first- and second-declension and third-declension nouns, respectively. Latin adjectives also have comparative and superlative forms. There are also a number of Latin participles. Latin numbers are sometimes declined as adjectives. See Numbers below. First- and second-declension adjectives are declined like first-declension nouns for the feminine forms and like second-declension nouns for the masculine and neuter forms. For example, for mortuus, mortua, mortuum (dead), mortua is declined like a regular first-declension noun (such as puella (girl)), mortuus is declined like a regular second-declension masculine noun (such as dominus (lord, master)), and mortuum is declined like a regular second-declension neuter noun (such as auxilium (help)). Third-declension adjectives are mostly declined like normal third-declension nouns, with a few exceptions. In the plural nominative neuter, for example, the ending is -ia (omnia (all, everything)), and for third-declension nouns, the plural nominative neuter ending is -a or -ia (capita (heads), animalia (animals)) They can have one, two or three forms for the masculine, feminine, and neuter nominative singular. Participles[edit] Latin participles, like English participles, are formed from a verb. There are a few main types of participles: Present Active Participles, Perfect Passive Participles, Future Active Participles, and Future Passive Participles. Prepositions[edit] Latin sometimes uses prepositions, depending on the type of prepositional phrase being used. Most prepositions are followed by a noun in either the accusative or ablative case: ""apud puerum"" (with the boy), with ""puerum"" being the accusative form of ""puer"", boy, and ""sine puero"" (without the boy, ""puero"" being the ablative form of ""puer"". A few adpositions, however, govern a noun in the genitive (such as ""gratia"" and ""tenus""). Verbs[edit] Main articles: Latin grammar and Latin conjugation A regular verb in Latin belongs to one of four main conjugations. A conjugation is ""a class of verbs with similar inflected forms.""[60] The conjugations are identified by the last letter of the verb's present stem. The present stem can be found by omitting the -re (-rī in deponent verbs) ending from the present infinitive form. The infinitive of the first conjugation ends in -ā-re or -ā-ri (active and passive respectively): amāre, ""to love,"" hortārī, ""to exhort""; of the second conjugation by -ē-re or -ē-rī: monēre, ""to warn"", verērī, ""to fear;"" of the third conjugation by -ere, -ī: dūcere, ""to lead,"" ūtī, ""to use""; of the fourth by -ī-re, -ī-rī: audīre, ""to hear,"" experīrī, ""to attempt"".[61] The stem categories descend from Indo-European and can therefore be compared to similar conjugations in other Indo-European languages. Irregular verbs are verbs that do not follow the regular conjugations in the formation of the inflected form. Irregular verbs in Latin are esse, ""to be""; velle, ""to want""; ferre, ""to carry""; edere, ""to eat""; dare, ""to give""; ire, ""to go""; quire, ""to be able""; fieri, ""to happen""; and their compounds.[61] There are six general tenses in Latin (present, imperfect, future, perfect, pluperfect and future perfect), three moods (indicative, imperative and subjunctive, in addition to the infinitive, participle, gerund, gerundive and supine), three persons (first, second and third), two numbers (singular and plural), two voices (active and passive) and two aspects (perfective and imperfective). Verbs are described by four principal parts: The first principal part is the first-person singular, present tense, active voice, indicative mood form of the verb. If the verb is impersonal, the first principal part will be in the third-person singular. The second principal part is the present active infinitive. The third principal part is the first-person singular, perfect active indicative form. Like the first principal part, if the verb is impersonal, the third principal part will be in the third-person singular. The fourth principal part is the supine form, or alternatively, the nominative singular of the perfect passive participle form of the verb. The fourth principal part can show one gender of the participle or all three genders (-us for masculine, -a for feminine and -um for neuter) in the nominative singular. The fourth principal part will be the future participle if the verb cannot be made passive. Most modern Latin dictionaries, if they show only one gender, tend to show the masculine; but many older dictionaries instead show the neuter, as it coincides with the supine. The fourth principal part is sometimes omitted for intransitive verbs, but strictly in Latin, they can be made passive if they are used impersonally, and the supine exists for such verbs. The six tenses of Latin are divided into two tense systems: the present system, which is made up of the present, imperfect and future tenses, and the perfect system, which is made up of the perfect, pluperfect and future perfect tenses. Each tense has a set of endings corresponding to the person, number, and voice of the subject. Subject (nominative) pronouns are generally omitted for the first (I, we) and second (you) persons except for emphasis. The table below displays the common inflected endings for the indicative mood in the active voice in all six tenses. For the future tense, the first listed endings are for the first and second conjugations, and the second listed endings are for the third and fourth conjugations: Tense Singular Plural 1st Person 2nd Person 3rd Person 1st Person 2nd Person 3rd Person Present -ō/m -s -t -mus -tis -nt Future -bō, -am -bis, -ēs -bit, -et -bimus, -ēmus -bitis, -ētis -bunt, -ent Imperfect -bam -bās -bat -bāmus -bātis -bant Perfect -ī -istī -it -imus -istis -ērunt Future Perfect -erō -eris/erīs -erit -erimus/-erīmus -eritis/-erītis -erint Pluperfect -eram -erās -erat -erāmus -erātis -erant Deponent verbs[edit] Some Latin verbs are deponent, causing their forms to be in the passive voice but retain an active meaning: hortor, hortārī, hortātus sum (to urge). Vocabulary[edit] As Latin is an Italic language, most of its vocabulary is likewise Italic, ultimately from the ancestral Proto-Indo-European language. However, because of close cultural interaction, the Romans not only adapted the Etruscan alphabet to form the Latin alphabet but also borrowed some Etruscan words into their language, including persona ""mask"" and histrio ""actor"".[62] Latin also included vocabulary borrowed from Oscan, another Italic language. After the Fall of Tarentum (272 BC), the Romans began Hellenising, or adopting features of Greek culture, including the borrowing of Greek words, such as camera (vaulted roof), sumbolum (symbol), and balineum (bath).[62] This Hellenisation led to the addition of ""Y"" and ""Z"" to the alphabet to represent Greek sounds.[63] Subsequently, the Romans transplanted Greek art, medicine, science and philosophy to Italy, paying almost any price to entice Greek skilled and educated persons to Rome and sending their youth to be educated in Greece. Thus, many Latin scientific and philosophical words were Greek loanwords or had their meanings expanded by association with Greek words, as ars (craft) and τέχνη (art).[64] Because of the Roman Empire's expansion and subsequent trade with outlying European tribes, the Romans borrowed some northern and central European words, such as beber (beaver), of Germanic origin, and bracae (breeches), of Celtic origin.[64] The specific dialects of Latin across Latin-speaking regions of the former Roman Empire after its fall were influenced by languages specific to the regions. The dialects of Latin evolved into different Romance languages. During and after the adoption of Christianity into Roman society, Christian vocabulary became a part of the language, either from Greek or Hebrew borrowings or as Latin neologisms.[65] Continuing into the Middle Ages, Latin incorporated many more words from surrounding languages, including Old English and other Germanic languages. Over the ages, Latin-speaking populations produced new adjectives, nouns, and verbs by affixing or compounding meaningful segments.[66] For example, the compound adjective, omnipotens, ""all-powerful,"" was produced from the adjectives omnis, ""all"", and potens, ""powerful"", by dropping the final s of omnis and concatenating. Often, the concatenation changed the part of speech, and nouns were produced from verb segments or verbs from nouns and adjectives.[67] Phrases (Neo-Latin)[edit] Main article: List of Latin phrases The phrases are mentioned with accents to show where stress is placed.[68] In Latin, words are normally stressed either on the second-to-last (penultimate) syllable, called in Latin paenultima or syllaba paenultima,[69] or on the third-to-last syllable, called in Latin antepaenultima or syllaba antepaenultima.[69] In the following notation, accented short vowels have an acute diacritic, accented long vowels have a circumflex diacritic (representing long falling pitch), and unaccented long vowels are marked simply with a macron. This reflects the tone of the voice with which, ideally, the stress is phonetically realized; but this may not always be clearly articulated on every word in a sentence.[70] Regardless of length, a vowel at the end of a word may be significantly shortened or even altogether deleted if the next word begins with a vowel also (a process called elision), unless a very short pause is inserted. As an exception, the following words: est (English ""is""), es (""[you (sg.)] are"") lose their own vowel e instead. sálvē to one person / salvête to more than one person – hello ávē to one person / avête to more than one person – greetings válē to one person / valête to more than one person – goodbye cûrā ut váleās – take care exoptâtus to male / exoptâta to female, optâtus to male / optâta to female, grâtus to male / grâta to female, accéptus to male / accépta to female – welcome quômodo válēs?, ut válēs? – how are you? béne – good béne váleō – I'm fine mále – bad mále váleō – I'm not good quaêsō (roughly: ['kwaeso:]/['kwe:so:]) – please amâbō tē – please íta, íta est, íta vêrō, sîc, sîc est, étiam – yes nôn, mínimē – no grâtiās tíbi, grâtiās tíbi ágō – thank you, I give thanks to you mágnās grâtiās, mágnās grâtiās ágō – many thanks máximās grâtiās, máximās grâtiās ágō, ingéntēs grâtiās ágō – thank you very much áccipe sīs to one person / accípite sîtis to more than one person, libénter – you're welcome quā aetâte es? – how old are you? 25 (vīgíntī quînque) ánnōs nâtus sumby male /25 ánnōs nâta sum by female – I am 25 years old úbi lātrîna est? – where is the toilet? scîs (tū) ... – do you speak (literally: ""do you know"") ...

Today, the numbers can be written with the Arabic numbers as well as with Roman numerals. The numbers 1, 2 and 3 and every whole hundred from 200 to 900 are declined as nouns and adjectives, with some differences. ūnus, ūna, ūnum (masculine, feminine, neuter) I one duo, duae, duo (m., f., n.) II two trēs, tria (m./f., n.) III three quattuor IIII or IV four quīnque V five sex VI six septem VII seven octō VIII eight novem VIIII or IX nine decem X ten quīnquāgintā L fifty centum C one hundred quīngentī, quīngentae, quīngenta (m., f., n.) D five hundred mīlle M one thousand The numbers from 4 to 100 do not change their endings. As in modern descendants such as Spanish, the gender for naming a number in isolation is masculine, so that ""1, 2, 3"" is counted as ūnus, duo, trēs. Example text[edit] Commentarii de Bello Gallico, also called De Bello Gallico (The Gallic War), written by Gaius Julius Caesar, begins with the following passage: Gallia est omnis divisa in partes tres, quarum unam incolunt Belgae, aliam Aquitani, tertiam qui ipsorum lingua Celtae, nostra Galli appellantur. Hi omnes lingua, institutis, legibus inter se differunt. Gallos ab Aquitanis Garumna flumen, a Belgis Matrona et Sequana dividit. Horum omnium fortissimi sunt Belgae, propterea quod a cultu atque humanitate provinciae longissime absunt, minimeque ad eos mercatores saepe commeant atque ea quae ad effeminandos animos pertinent important, proximique sunt Germanis, qui trans Rhenum incolunt, quibuscum continenter bellum gerunt. Qua de causa Helvetii quoque reliquos Gallos virtute praecedunt, quod fere cotidianis proeliis cum Germanis contendunt, cum aut suis finibus eos prohibent aut ipsi in eorum finibus bellum gerunt. Eorum una pars, quam Gallos obtinere dictum est, initium capit a flumine Rhodano, continetur Garumna flumine, Oceano, finibus Belgarum; attingit etiam ab Sequanis et Helvetiis flumen Rhenum; vergit ad septentriones. Belgae ab extremis Galliae finibus oriuntur; pertinent ad inferiorem partem fluminis Rheni; spectant in septentrionem et orientem solem. Aquitania a Garumna flumine ad Pyrenaeos montes et eam partem Oceani quae est ad Hispaniam pertinet; spectat inter occasum solis et septentriones. The same text may be marked for all long vowels (before any possible elisions at word boundary) with apices over vowel letters, including customarily before ""nf"" and ""ns"" where a long vowel is automatically produced: Gallia est omnis dívísa in partés trés, quárum únam incolunt Belgae, aliam Aquítání, tertiam quí ipsórum linguá Celtae, nostrá Gallí appellantur. Hí omnés linguá, ínstitútís, légibus inter sé differunt. Gallós ab Aquítánís Garumna flúmen, á Belgís Mátrona et Séquana dívidit.

In addition to championing interdisciplinary projects, we actively collaborate with industrial partners to bring forth industrially relevant projects. “Being a programme manager means that I’m a jack of all trades and the master of them all too. I’m responsible for organising the CDT React’s programme to accommodate around 12 studentship projects each year (we will take on 60 overall) to focus on future research challenges across chemistry, chemical engineering and data science. I also oversee the development of the programme to ensure that we effectively build our researchers’ professional skills e.g. research communications and research ethics. Finally I oversee the research strategy which involves communicating with our external and industry advisory boards. “Previously, I carried out similar roles in two Imperial-based British Heart Foundation Centres (Research Excellence and Regenerative Medicine) and in the Institute of Epidemiology and Healthcare at University College London. “I’m proud of what we have achieved in the past year, how we developed our recruitment process to improve our EDI statistics. We have significantly widened participation with a new protocol, which works to remove biases and involves our scientific panel to add objective layers to the recruitment process. Our successful approach is now being adopted by other similar programmes across the College. “It’s been difficult not to feel a little bit helpless through this unique time. Although lockdowns and other restrictions have had an impact on programme, we have adapted well to help our students manage new ways of working, feel more involved and less isolated and anxious by making ad hoc provisions to accommodate their mental wellbeing. This I’m most proud of. “Personally, the past year has been a bit of a whirlwind. I learned new skills, adapted to new ways of working, kept busy with projects, overcrowded my flat with plants, tasked myself with complicated recipes and like everyone else – I walked. A Lot. With things opening up and life returning to normal, I’m keen to develop the programme further but also bring the cohorts together for some much-needed socialising.” By Elizabeth NixonCategorised under Support Staff Sidebar About Imperial people Who are our Imperial People?

According to the Monroe County History Center, Bloomington is known as the ""Gateway to Scenic Southern Indiana."" The city was established in 1818 by a group of settlers from Kentucky, Tennessee, the Carolinas, and Virginia who were so impressed with ""a haven of blooms"" that they called it Bloomington.[7] The population was 80,405 at the 2010 census.[8] The city's population was estimated at 85,755 as of July 2019 by the U.S. Census Bureau.[9] Bloomington is the home to Indiana University Bloomington. Established in 1820, IU Bloomington has 49,695[10] students, as of September 2016, and is the original and largest campus of Indiana University. Most of the campus buildings are built of Indiana limestone. Bloomington has been designated a Tree City for 32 years, as of 2015[update].[11][12] The city was also the location of the Academy Award–winning 1979 movie Breaking Away, featuring a reenactment of Indiana University's annual Little 500 bicycle race. Monroe County's famous limestone quarries are also featured in the movie.

The city's relatively varied topography is a sharp contrast to the flatter terrain more typical of central to northern portions of Indiana. Water[edit] Griffy Lake, once the central source of drinking water for the city. Bloomington is on comparatively high ground, the summit of the divide between the basins of the West Fork and East Fork of Indiana's White River. Accordingly, there are no major watercourses within the city, nor is much groundwater available for wells.[24] The largest stream within the city is Clear Creek, with its eastern branch known on the Indiana University campus as Jordan River. Due to the absence of either natural lakes or rivers or groundwater in or near the city, a number of dams have been constructed on nearby creeks over the last 100 years to provide for the water needs of Bloomington and Monroe County. Early 20th-century damming projects occurred at locations southwest of the city, the most notable being the Leonard Springs Dam. Due to the limestone formations underlying the reservoirs and the dams, water kept seeping from the reservoirs through naturally developing underground channels. Despite all efforts, the city was never able to fully stop the leakage, and had to resort to pumping leaking water back to the reservoir.[24] By the 1920s, a more radical solution was needed to deal with the water crisis. A new reservoir, known as Griffy Lake, was constructed in a more geologically suitable area north of the city.[24] (It is now within Bloomington's official city limits.) Later, in the 1950s, two much larger reservoirs, Lake Lemon and Lake Monroe were created in the northeastern and southeastern parts of Monroe County. Monroe Lake was created by the US Army Corps of Engineers for flood control, but has since been used to supply the city and the county with water. The water pumping station at Griffy Lake has been mothballed.[25] Presently, the city is supplied with drinking water from Lake Monroe, via the Monroe Water Treatment Plant on S Shields Ridge Rd. Originally opened in 1967, it was expanded in 2014, and now is capable of producing 30 million gallons of water per day.[26] The sewer water from the northern part of the city is treated at the Blucher Poole Wastewater Treatment Plant (constructed 1968), and discharged into the Bean Blossom Creek.[27] The sewer water from the southern half of the city goes to Dillman Road Wastewater Treatment Plant (constructed 1982), and is then discharged into the Clear Creek.[25] [28] [29] Environment[edit] PCB pollution, associated with Westinghouse's operations, long was a concern in the area.[30][31] A number of sites,[32] in particular, Bennett's Dump and Lemon Lane Landfill at the northwestern edge of the city and Neal's Landfill in the county, were listed as Superfund sites. Clean-up operations at the Bennett Quarry site, started in 1983, were largely completed by 2000.,[33] while cleanups at the other sites were completed in 2012.

It is the flagship campus of the Indiana University and, with over 40,000 students, its largest campus.[5][6] Indiana University is a member of the Association of American Universities and is classified among ""R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity"".[7] It has numerous schools and programs, including the Jacobs School of Music, the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering, the O'Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs, the Kelley School of Business, the School of Public Health, the School of Nursing, the School of Optometry, the Maurer School of Law, the School of Education, the Media School, and the Hamilton Lugar School of Global and International Studies.[8] As of Fall 2017, 43,710 students attend Indiana University. While 55.1% of the student body was from Indiana, students from all 50 states, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and 165 countries were also enrolled.[3] As of 2018[update], the average ACT score is a 28 and an SAT score of 1276.[9] The university is home to an extensive student life program, with more than 750 student organizations on campus and with around 17 percent of undergraduates joining the Greek system.[10] Indiana athletic teams compete in Division I of the NCAA and are known as the Indiana Hoosiers. The university is a member of the Big Ten Conference; since it does not have a mascot, all teams are known simply as ""Hoosiers"". Indiana's faculty, staff, and alumni include nine Nobel laureates, 17 Rhodes Scholars, 17 Marshall Scholars, and five MacArthur Fellows. In addition, students and alumni have won six Academy Awards, 49 Grammy Awards, 32 Emmy Awards, 20 Pulitzer Prizes, four Tony Awards, and 104 Olympic medals (55 gold, 17 silver, and 32 bronze).[11][12] Contents 1 History 1.1 Early years 1.2 20th century 2 Campus 2.1 Facilities and architecture 2.2 Indiana Memorial Union 2.3 Athletic facilities 2.4 Indiana University Auditorium 2.5 Department of Chemistry 3 Libraries 3.1 Herman B Wells Library 3.2 Branch libraries 3.3 Black Film Center/Archive 3.4 Indiana University Libraries Moving Image Archive 3.5 Lilly Library 3.6 Fine Arts Library 3.7 William and Gayle Cook Music Library 3.8 Residential Programs and Services Libraries 4 Museums 4.1 Sidney and Lois Eskenazi Museum of Art 4.2 Mathers Museum of World Cultures 4.3 Grunwald Gallery of Art 4.4 Indiana Memorial Union 5 Academics 5.1 Rankings and reputation 5.2 Schools and Colleges 5.2.1 College of Arts and Sciences 5.2.1.1 School of Art, Architecture + Design 5.2.1.2 School of Global and International Studies 5.2.1.3 The Media School 5.2.2 Hutton Honors College 5.2.3 Jacobs School of Music 5.2.4 Kelley School of Business 5.2.5 Maurer School of Law 5.2.6 School of Education 5.2.7 Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering 5.2.8 O'Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs 5.2.9 School of Public Health-Bloomington 5.2.10 School of Social Work 5.2.11 School of Medicine 5.2.12 School of Nursing 5.2.13 School of Optometry 5.2.14 University Graduate School 6 Athletics 7 Media 8 Faculty 8.1 Enrollment statistics 9 Notable faculty and alumni 10 Sustainability 11 Transportation 12 References 13 Further reading 13.1 Primary sources 14 External links History[edit] Early years[edit] Indiana's state government in Corydon established Indiana University on January 20, 1820, as the ""State Seminary.""[13] Construction began in 1822 at what is now called Seminary Square Park near the intersection of Second Street and College Avenue. Classes began on April 4, 1825.[14] The first professor was Baynard Rush Hall, a Presbyterian minister who taught all of the classes in 1825–27. In the first year, he taught twelve students and was paid $250. Hall was a classicist who focused on Greek and Latin and believed that the study of classical philosophy and languages formed the basis of the best education.[15] The first class graduated in 1830. From 1820 to 1889 a legal-political battle was fought between IU and Vincennes University as to which was the legitimate state university.[16][17] The Sample Gates, the main entrance to the Indiana University Bloomington Campus In 1829, Andrew Wylie became the first president, serving until his death in 1851. The school's name was changed to ""Indiana College"" in 1829, and to ""Indiana University"" in 1839. Wylie and David Maxwell, president of the board of trustees, were devout Presbyterians. They spoke of the nonsectarian status of the school but generally hired fellow Presbyterians. Presidents and professors were expected to set a moral example for their charges. After six ministers in a row, the first non-clergyman to become president was the young biology professor David Starr Jordan, in 1885.[18] Jordan followed Baptist theologian Lemuel Moss, who resigned after a scandal broke regarding his involvement with a female professor. Jordan (president 1884–1891) improved the university's finances and public image, doubled its enrollment, and instituted an elective system along the lines of his alma mater, Cornell University.[19] Jordan became president of Stanford University in June 1891.[20] The growth of the institution was slow. In 1851, IU had nearly a hundred students and seven professors. IU admitted its first woman student, Sarah Parke Morrison, in 1867, making IU the fourth public university to admit women on an equal basis with men. Morrison went on to become the first female professor at IU in 1873. Mathematician Joseph Swain was IU's first Hoosier-born president, 1893 to 1902. He established Kirkwood Hall in 1894; a gymnasium for men in 1896, which later was named Assembly Hall; and Kirkwood Observatory in 1900. He began construction for Science Hall in 1901. During his presidency, student enrollment increased from 524 to 1,285.[21][22] Morrison Hall in June 1942 In 1883, IU awarded its first Ph.D. and played its first intercollegiate sport (baseball), prefiguring the school's future status as a major research institution and a power in collegiate athletics. But another incident that year was of more immediate concern: the original campus in Seminary Square burned to the ground. The college was rebuilt between 1884 and 1908 at the far eastern edge of Bloomington. (Today, the city has expanded eastward, and the ""new"" campus is once again in the midst of the city.) One challenge was that Bloomington's limited water supply was inadequate for its population of 12,000 and could not handle university expansion. The University commissioned a study that led to building a reservoir for its use.[23] 20th century[edit] In 1902, IU enrolled 1203 undergraduates; all but 65 were Hoosiers. There were 82 graduate students including ten from out-of-state. The curriculum emphasized the classics, as befitted a gentleman, and stood in contrast to the service-oriented curriculum at Purdue, which presented itself as of direct benefit to farmers, industrialists, and businessmen.[24] The first extension office of IU was opened in Indianapolis in 1916. In 1920/1921 the School of Music and the School of Commerce and Finance (what later became the Kelley School of Business) were opened. In the 1940s Indiana University opened extension campuses in Kokomo and Fort Wayne. The controversial Kinsey Institute for sexual research was established in 1945. During the Great Depression, Indiana University fared much better than most state schools thanks to the entrepreneurship of its young president Herman Wells. He collaborated with Frederick L. Hovde, the president of IU's cross-state rival, Purdue; together they approached the Indiana delegation to Congress, indicating their highest priorities. For Wells, it was to build a world-class music school, replacing dilapidated facilities. As a result of these efforts, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) built one of the finest facilities in the country. He added matching funds from the state legislature and opened a full-scale fund-raising campaign among alumni and the business community. In 1942, Wells reported that ""The past five years have been the greatest single period of expansion in the physical plant of the University in its entire history. In this period 15 new buildings have been constructed.[25][26] In 1960, the IU student body elected Thomas Atkins, an African-American from Elkhart, Indiana, to the position of president of the student body. A throng of white students protested the result by parading around campus waving Confederate flags and allegedly blamed Atkins' victory on a ""bunch of beatniks."" When the protesters approached the female dormitory on campus, they were met with ""a barrage of cosmetic bottles, old shoes, and other objects.""[27] Campus[edit] The Indiana University Bloomington campus of 1,933 acres (7.82 km2) includes abundant green space and historic buildings dating to the university's reconstruction in the late nineteenth century. In 2011, Travel+Leisure listed the University as one of the most beautiful college campuses in the United States.[28] The campus rests on a bed of Indiana Limestone, specifically Salem Limestone and Harrodsburg Limestone, with outcroppings of St. Louis Limestone. The ""Jordan River"" is a stream flowing through the center of campus. A section of Bloomington's Clear Creek,[29] it is named after David Starr Jordan, Darwinist, ichthyologist, and president of IU, later, of Stanford University.[30] Bloomington was ranked 5th best city for educated millennials by Business Insider.[31] College Ranker listed Bloomington as #6 Best College Town to Live in Forever.[32] Lumosity and VentureBeat both rank Bloomington as the 7th smartest city in America.[33][34] Bloomington has been ranked the 4th ""Gayest (per-capita) City in America"" by The Advocate.[35] Facilities and architecture[edit] United States historic placeThe Old CrescentU.S. National Register of Historic PlacesU.S. Historic district Maxwell HallLocationIndiana University Campus, Bloomington, IndianaArea20 acres (8.1 ha)Built1884 (1884)ArchitectMultipleArchitectural styleLate Victorian, Gothic, RomanesqueNRHP reference No.80000028[36]Added to NRHPSeptember 8, 1980 Many of the campus's buildings, especially the older central buildings, are made from Indiana Limestone quarried locally. The Works Progress Administration built much of the campus's core during the Great Depression. Many of the campus's buildings were built and most of its land acquired during the 1950s and 1960s when first soldiers attending under the GI Bill and then the baby boom swelled the university's enrollment from 5,403 in 1940 to 30,368 in 1970. Some buildings on campus underwent similar expansion. As additions were constructed by building onto the outside of existing buildings, exterior surfaces were incorporated into their new interiors, making this expansion visible in the affected buildings' architecture. The Chemistry and Biology buildings serve as examples, where two of the interior walls of the latter's library were clearly constructed as limestone exteriors. The Bryan House is the traditional on-campus home of the university president. Nine of the oldest buildings are included in a national historic district known as The Old Crescent. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.[36] They are the Collegiate Gothic style Student Service Building (1906–1908); Indiana University Museum (1905); Richardsonian Romanesque style Maxwell Building (1890, 1907–1908); Owen Hall (1885); Wylie Hall (1885); Kirkwood Hall (1895); Lindley Hall (1903); Gothic Revival style Rose Well House (1908); and Kirkwood Observatory (1900).[37] The Sample Gates serve as the entryway to Indiana University's campus and The Old Crescent. It is positioned between Franklin Hall and Bryan Hall.[38] After several failed attempts to create an arched entrance to campus, in 1987, Edson Sample provided funding to build the archway based on the 1961 design proposed by Eggers & Higgins.[39] The Indiana University Cinema opened in January 2011 in the former University Theatre building, which was built in the 1930s. The Bloomington campus also has a biology research greenhouse in Jordan Hall that is open to the public, one of the highlights of which is a corpse flower (Amorphophallus titanum) named Wally.[40][41] Also on campus, the Kirkwood Observatory is open to the public one day a week. The 1979 movie Breaking Away was filmed on location in Bloomington and the IU campus. It also featured a reenactment of the annual Little 500 bicycle race. The IU campus also has trails that many utilize for biking and running. The trails in Bloomington and nearby areas total nearly 1,200 miles (1,900 km). Indiana Memorial Union[edit] Main article: Indiana Memorial Union The over 500,000-square-foot (46,000 m2) Indiana Memorial Union (IMU) is the second-largest student union in the world. In addition to stores and restaurants, it features an eight-story student activities tower (home to the Indiana University Student Association, Indiana Memorial Union Board, and a variety of other student organizations), a 186-room hotel, a 400-seat theatre, a 5,000-square-foot (460 m2) Alumni Hall, 50,000 square feet (4,600 m2) of meeting space, and a bowling alley. The IMU houses an outstanding collection of Indiana art including artists from Brown County, the Hoosier Group, Richmond Group and others. This collection is the largest public collection of art outside of a museum. Athletic facilities[edit] See also: Indiana Hoosiers Sweetheart tree standing in the courtyard of the Chemistry building at Indiana University Bloomington. Indiana University's athletic facilities are located on campus and are grouped in between East 17th Street, Dunn Street and the IN-45/IN-46 bypass. In the 17,000-seat Assembly Hall (home to the IU NCAA basketball team), there are five NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship banners on display. Cook Hall, Memorial Stadium, Mellencamp Pavilion, the Gladstein Fieldhouse, the IU Tennis Center, the Billy Hayes Track and Bill Armstrong Stadium are all also located within the complex. Indiana University Auditorium[edit] Indiana University Auditorium (IU Auditorium), is a 3,200 seat performing arts venue located at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana.[42][43] It is situated in IU's Fine Arts Plaza alongside the Lilly Library and the Eskenazi School of Art, Architecture + Design.[44] Construction on IU Auditorium began in 1939 as a part of the Federal Works Agency Projects.[45] IU Auditorium officially opened its doors March 22, 1941.[46] IU Auditorium's Hall of Murals is the home of the Indiana Murals, created by American artist Thomas Hart Benton. 16 of the 22 total panels created are housed at the auditorium.[47] Today, IU Auditorium presents Broadway touring acts, popular musical artists, comedians, classical musicians and more.[48] Department of Chemistry[edit] The Chemistry Department has a great history at Indiana University since the very early days of the institution. Chemistry courses were first added to the curriculum in 1829 by Andrew Wylie, IU president at the time (1829–1851).[49] The first degrees in chemistry were awarded in 1890. The graduate school at Indiana University was not formally established until 1904 but not soon after, a plan for graduate work in chemistry was underway. However, the first Ph.D. in chemistry was not granted until 1921.[50] A crucial event in the history of the Chemistry Department was in 1931 when the construction of a new facility explicitly for chemistry began which led to major growth within the department. Some of the department's most acclaimed and prolific faculty came to the University during this time. A major staple to the department is the famous Sweetheart tree [51] that has stood outside the Chemistry Building since it was built in 1931. Even when a major addition to the building was made in the 1980s, architects decided to preserve the beloved tree and build around it. A sad day came in the spring of 2018 when the University announced the famous sweetheart tree was dying and removal was scheduled to begin on April 11. IU intends to plant a new tree in its place once the soil has recovered. Libraries[edit] Herman B Wells Library, seen from IU Arboretum The Indiana University Bloomington Library System supports over twenty libraries and provides access to more than 9.9 million books, 800 databases, 60,000 electronic journal titles, and 815,000 ebooks.[52] The system is the 14th largest library in North America by volumes held.[53] Herman B Wells Library[edit] IU's Herman B Wells Library holds more than 4.6 million volumes.[54] Before a ceremony in June 2005, when it was renamed for IU's former president and chancellor, this building was simply called the Main Library.[55] The architectural firm Eggers & Higgins designed the largely windowless, limestone paneled library, whose construction began in 1966 and was completed in 1969.[56] The building contains eleven floors in the East Tower (research collection) and five floors in the West Tower (the undergraduate core collection). In 2014 the first floors of both towers were renovated and reintroduced as the Learning Commons and Scholars' Commons. The library is also home to Indiana University Press and the University Graduate School. It is the former home of the Information and Library Science Department, which is now hosted by Luddy Hall. An oft-repeated urban legend holds that the library is sinking because when it was built, engineers failed to take into account the weight of all the books that would occupy the building. An article in the Indiana Daily Student newspaper debunks this myth, stating, among other things, that the building rests on a 94 ft (28.6 m) thick limestone bedrock.[57] Branch libraries[edit] In addition to IU's main library, the Bloomington Libraries support more than twenty additional libraries:[58] Archives of African American Music & Culture Archives of Traditional Music Black Film Center/Archive Business/SPEA Information Commons (Library for the Kelley School of Business and the O'Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs) The Science Library Education Library, located within the Wendell E. Wright School of Education LGBTQ+ Library Indiana Institute on Disability and Community, Center for Disability Information and Referral (CeDIR) Library Indiana Prevention Resource Center Library Indiana University Libraries Moving Image Archive (IULMIA) Kinsey Institute Library Jerome Hall Law Library (Library for the Maurer School of Law) Life Sciences Library (Library for the Biology Department, Medical Sciences Program, and Nursing Program) Lilly Library (rare books and manuscripts) Neal-Marshall Black Culture Center Library Optometry Library Ostrom Workshop Library Residential Programs and Services Libraries Sinor Research Institute for Inner Asian Studies University Archives and Records Management William & Gayle Cook Music Library Wylie House Museum Black Film Center/Archive[edit] The Black Film Center/Archive (BFC/A), located at Indiana University, was ""established in 1981 as a repository of films and related materials by and about African Americans.""[59] Professor Phyllis R. Klotman founded the repository when it became apparent that rare and valuable films created by and about African Americans were being lost due to lack of preservation and inadequate resources.[60] The BFC/A has an extensive collection that includes films on various physical media, posters of numerous sizes for films distributed throughout the world, photographs and film stills, and manuscripts of filmmakers and scholars. Although the materials are not available for circulation or distribution, the archive has rooms for viewing films and utilizing materials. Indiana University Libraries Moving Image Archive[edit] The Indiana University Libraries Moving Image Archive (IULMIA) is one of the largest repositories for educational film and video in the United States.[61] Founded in 2009, IULMIA contains over 100,000 items spanning over 80 years of audiovisual history.[62][63] Highlights of its holdings include a collection of over 200 film cameras and projectors, more than 80,000 commercials from the Clio Awards, and approximately 50,000 educational films that Indiana University circulated to classrooms nationwide during the 20th century.[63][64][65] In 2012, the Moving Image Archive was accepted as a member of the International Federation of Film Archives.[66] Lilly Library[edit] Lilly Library Main article: Lilly Library The Lilly Library is one of the largest rare book and manuscript libraries in the United States.

M. Synge's The Playboy of the Western World, and J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan, and typescripts of many of Ian Fleming's James Bond novels. The library also owns the papers of Hollywood directors Orson Welles and John Ford, the poets Sylvia Plath and Ezra Pound, and authors Edith Wharton, Max Eastman and Upton Sinclair. The library is also home to four Academy Awards, donated by alumni. In 2006, the library received a collection of 30,000 mechanical puzzles from Jerry Slocum. The collection will be on permanent display. Special permission is not required to use the collections, and the library has several exhibition galleries that are open to the public. Within the Lilly Library is the Ruth E. Adomeit collection of miniature books, one of the world's largest.[68] Among the collection are rare miniature books such as ""From Morn Till Eve"", a miniature book that presents biblical quotations in a devotional form, with one phrase for each morning and evening of a month. The Online Computer Library Center (OCLC) had listed that, ""the only known copy as being in the collection of famed miniature book collector Ruth E. Adomeit"",[69] which is now in the Lilly Library. Fine Arts Library[edit] IU's first Fine Arts Library was established in the late 1930s as part of the Departmental office on the second floor, east wing of the University Library which was then in Franklin Hall. In 1941, two important events occurred: art historian Henry Radford Hope became chairman of the Fine Arts Department in the Fall and the Fine Arts Center was created by remodeling Mitchell Hall Annex. The Fine Arts Library moved into IU Art Museum designed by I.M. Pei in August 1981. This location was closed for renovations to the museum in spring 2017. All fine arts materials are currently located on the 9th floor of the Herman B Wells Library.[70] William and Gayle Cook Music Library[edit] The William and Gayle Cook Music Library, recognized as one of the largest academic music libraries in the world, serves the Jacobs School of Music and the Bloomington Campus of Indiana University. It occupies a four-floor, 55,000 square-foot facility in a wing of the Bess Meshulam Simon Music Library and Recital Center, dedicated in November 1995. The collection comprises over 700,000 cataloged items on 56,733 linear feet of shelves. The Cook Music Library holds many special collections, including audio and print collections. One notable collection contains items from Leonard Bernstein's compositional studio, including items such as clothing, furniture, recordings, books, and awards.[71] Residential Programs and Services Libraries[edit] Residence Hall Library programs began in the 1930s at Harvard University. By 1978, there were twenty-one institutions with residential library systems.[72] Today, Indiana University has only one of two residential library programs that still operates. Additionally, Indiana University has continued to expand its residential library system, adding the most recent branch in 2017. There are currently fourteen library branches: Briscoe, Campus View Apartments, Collins LLC, Eigenmann, Forest, Foster, McNutt, Read, Spruce, Teter, Union Street Center, Wells Quad, Wilkie, and Wright.[73] The libraries are open daily while classes are in session. Previously, half of the branches were considered Movies, Media, and More centers, and only offered DVDs and CDs. In 2018, the decision was made to have all library branches offer books in addition to movies and games. The libraries hire graduate students in Indiana University's Master of Library Science program to act as Center Supervisors, who lead a staff of seven student assistants in staffing the libraries each evening. New material is added to the libraries each week, and any student or staff member of Indiana University can check out material using their Crimson Card. Museums[edit] Sidney and Lois Eskenazi Museum of Art[edit] Main article: Indiana University Art Museum IU Art Museum The Sidney and Lois Eskenazi Museum of Art, formerly known as the Indiana University Art Museum,[74] was established in 1941 and has occupied a building designed by the world-renowned architecture firm I.M.

Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering[edit] Main article: Indiana University School of Informatics Lindley Hall, Former Home of the Department of Computer Science In 1999, the Indiana University School of Informatics was established as an environment for research professors and students to develop new uses for information technology to solve specific problems in areas as diverse as biology, fine arts, and economics.[116] This was the first school of Informatics established in the United States. Informatics is also interested in ""how people transform technology, and how technology transforms us.""[117] In 2005 the Department of Computer Science moved from the College of Arts and Sciences to the School of Informatics, prompting the school to expand its name to ""School of Informatics and Computing"".[118] This move merged several faculty, bringing the total core faculty to over 100. In 2015, Indiana University submitted a proposal to the Indiana Commission for Higher Education for the establishment of an Engineering program.[119] Purdue University attempted to block the proposal, but the commission shot them down, passing the proposal unanimously.[120] Following approval, in 2016 the new Department of Intelligent Systems Engineering was established as a part of the School of Informatics and Computing, and its name was again changed, this time to the ""School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering,"" commonly referred to as SICE.[121] Shortly after, IU approved the construction of a $39.8 million new facility to house the rechristened school, named Luddy Hall, after alumnus, Fred Luddy.[122] Luddy Hall opened its doors in January 2018. Informatics also has strong ties with the Media School, Jacobs School of Music, and the Cognitive Science program. The School is one of a handful that offers degrees in Human-Computer Interaction.[123] The School offers master's degrees in Human-Computer Interaction Design, Music Informatics, Bioinformatics, Chemical Informatics, Security Informatics, Intelligent Systems Engineering, Computer Science, and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science, Informatics, and Intelligent Systems Engineering. Specialization areas for the Ph.D. in Computer Science include artificial intelligence, databases, distributed systems, formal methods, high-performance computing, programming languages, and security. The Informatics Ph.D. program offers tracks in bioinformatics, cheminformatics, complex systems, human-computer interaction design, logic and mathematical foundations of informatics, music informatics, security informatics, and social informatics. The School has four departments, namely, Informatics, Intelligent Systems Engineering, Computer Science, and Information and Library Science. The IU Department of Information and Library Science (ILS) was ranked by U.S. News & World Report in 2016 as the 8th best program in the nation.[91] It has also been ranked number 1 in scholarly productivity by a 2006 study published in the journal Library & Information Science Research.[124] ILS is housed on the ground floor of the Wells Library's Western Tower. In April 2012, what was formerly known as the School of Library and Information Science and IU's School of Informatics and Computing began a discussion on a possible merger of the two schools. With the success of negotiations and arrangements, Indiana University Board of Trustees approved the merger on October 22, 2012. Effective from July 1, 2013, IU School of Informatics and School of Library and Information and Science will merge into a single school to be called the IU School of Informatics and Computing.[125] O'Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs[edit] Main article: O'Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs The O'Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs (or SPEA) is the largest school of its kind in the United States. Founded in 1972, SPEA is known for its distinctive interdisciplinary approach. It brings together the social, natural, behavioral, and administrative sciences in one faculty. SPEA has a sister ""core"" campus at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (or IUPUI) and an affiliate program is operated at Indiana University's Gary campus. In their 2016 rankings, U.S. News & World Report rated SPEA ranked tied for first in the nation, with five of its programs ranked in the top 10: environmental policy and management 1st, nonprofit management and leadership 1st, public finance and budgeting 1st, public management administration 3rd, and public policy analysis 7th.[126] Similar rankings do not yet exist for graduate schools of environmental science or undergraduate schools in either public affairs or environmental science. According to the 2020 Shanghai Global Academic Ranking of Subjects, SPEA is the second most highly ranked institution in the world for public administration.[127] Also in 2020, US News & World Report ranked SPEA's MPA program #1 in the country.[128] SPEA is the headquarters of the Public Administration Review, the premier journal of public administration research, theory, and practice. SPEA is also home to the Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, the Journal of Public Budgeting and Finance and Small Business Economics. SPEA has more than a dozen joint programs in social and natural sciences and professional fields. Popular majors include nonprofit management and leadership, public policy, public finance, and arts administration. SPEA alumni include radio and television host Tavis Smiley and former U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill. Among SPEA's faculty was Elinor Ostrom, the first woman to receive the Nobel Prize in Economics. She was named by Time Magazine one of the 100 most influential people in the United States. School of Public Health-Bloomington[edit] Indiana University School of Public Health-Bloomington Main article: Indiana University School of Public Health-Bloomington Established in 2012[129] the school and programs have grown to encompass a broad spectrum of academic interests and professional fields. The school was founded in 1946 as the School of Health, Physical Education, and Recreation. It transitioned into the School of Public Health-Bloomington and was renamed in September 2012.[130][131] It was accredited by the Council on Education in Public Health in June 2015.[132] The school has nearly 3,000 students and 24,000 living alumni, with undergraduate and advanced degree programs offered through five academic departments: Applied Health Science, Environmental Health, Epidemiology & Biostatistics, Kinesiology, and Recreation, Park, & Tourism Studies.[133] The Division of Campus Recreational Sports within the IU School of Public Health-Bloomington provides sport and fitness opportunities for the IU community and the public.[134] The school has numerous centers, institutes, and specialized laboratories, including the Center for Sexual Health Promotion, the Indiana Prevention Resource Center, the National Center on Accessibility, the Rural Center for AIDS/STD Prevention, among others.[135] The school's resources include more than 12,000 square feet (1,100 m2) of research and teaching laboratories, and nearly 275,000 square feet (25,500 m2) of indoor and outdoor sport and fitness facilities, including recreation centers, aquatics centers, and acreage that includes Bradford Woods. School of Social Work[edit] The Indiana University School of Social Work was founded in 1911 as the Department of Social Service, thus making it the oldest professional social work education program begun and still functioning as a part of a university. In July 2007, the Indiana University Division of Labor Studies merged with the School of Social Work.[136] Department of Labor Studies: the Department of Labor Studies, a unit housed within the School of Social Work, was founded in the 1940s during the tenure of Herman B Wells in response to the growing role of organized labor in American society. Today, the Division is one of only several degree-granting programs in the nation for the area of labor studies or industrial relations. Notable faculty in recent years have included Leonard Page, General Counsel for the National Labor Relations Board during the Clinton Administration, and labor economist/author Michael Yates. School of Medicine[edit] Main article: Indiana University School of Medicine School of Nursing[edit] Main article: Indiana University School of Nursing The Indiana University Training School for Nurses was established in Indianapolis in 1914 in conjunction with the establishment of the Robert W. Long Hospital and in association with the IU School of Medicine to offer training leading to a nursing diploma. It was renamed the IU School of Nursing in 1956.[137] In the 1930s a Division of Nursing Education under the IU School of Education was created on the Bloomington campus to offer additional training to nursing students seeking B.S.; an M.S. degree program was added in 1945.[138] Today, the School of Nursing is located at several of the IU campuses, with Indianapolis and Bloomington being the main locations. As of 2017[update] its degree programs include a four-year Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) degree, a Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) degree, and two doctoral degrees: Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) and Doctor of Philosophy in nursing (Ph.D.).[139] The National League for Nursing has recognized the School as a Center of Excellence in two categories simultaneously for creating environments that: Promote the Pedagogical Expertise of Faculty and Creating Environments (effective 2006–22) and Advance the Science of Nursing Education (effective 2012–21).[140] The IU School of Nursing ranks eighth among public universities who receive funding from the National Institutes of Health. Almost forty percent of the baccalaureate-prepared professional nurses in Indiana graduate from the IU School of Nursing each year.[citation needed] In 2017 the U.S. News & World Report ranked the IU School of Nursing twenty-eighth for its master's degree program and twenty-third for its Doctor of Nursing Practice degree among U.S. colleges and universities; its online graduate program ranked thirty-ninth.[141] School of Optometry[edit] The main building of the School of Optometry The Indiana University School of Optometry was founded in 1951. The school became a degree-granting institution of its own in 1975. Located at the southwest border of campus the Doctor of Optometry (OD) program admits on average 70–80 students per year. The school operates a 22,000-square-foot (2,000 m2) community eye care clinic in Bloomington and a clinic in Indianapolis. In addition to providing optometric education, the facility also houses the Borish Center for Ophthalmic Research, officially dedicated in October 1995. The Borish Center provides opportunities for undergraduate, professional, and graduate students to participate directly in vision research. University Graduate School[edit] Indiana University's Graduate school offers 190 degrees and certification programs. IU boasts that on average, their Ph.D. students take less time to complete their degrees compared to peers in similar institutions. For example, students who seek a Ph.D. in Social Sciences take, on average, almost a year less to complete the degree than students from peer universities.[142] In 2007–08, the Graduate and Professional Student Organization partnered with the Graduate to create the Emissaries for Graduate Student Diversity. Emissaries work either towards outreach and enrollment or retention and community building. Outreach and enrollment emissaries inform prospective students about opportunities at IU. They also help them navigate the admissions process. The retention and community building Emissaries act as mentors for current students.[143] The Graduate School has a separate student government (Graduate and Professional Student Government, or GPSG). They collaborate with faculty to help improve the quality of services offered to graduate students attending Indiana University.[144] Athletics[edit] Main article: Indiana Hoosiers See also: Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball, Indiana Hoosiers football, and Indiana Hoosiers men's soccer Basketball players huddle before a game in their candy striped pants. IU's intercollegiate athletics program has a long tradition in several key sports. From its beginnings with baseball in 1867, the Hoosier athletic program has grown to include over 600 male and female student-athletes on 24 varsity teams boasting one of the nation's best overall records. Sports sponsored by the university include football, men's basketball, women's basketball, cross country and track, softball, baseball, golf, tennis, rowing, volleyball, swimming and diving, and wrestling. The Hoosiers became a member of the Big Ten Conference on December 1, 1899. The school's national affiliation is with the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). National team titles (now totaling 26; 25 NCAA, 1 AIAW) have been won in nine men's sports and one women's sport (tennis), topped by a record-setting six straight men's swimming & diving titles, eight men's soccer crowns and five titles in men's basketball. Indiana University's men's basketball team is one of the most decorated programs in the nation, having won five national championships. Indiana student-athletes have won 133 NCAA individual titles, including 79 in men's swimming and diving and 31 in men's track and field. Also, IU teams have won or shared 157 Big Ten Conference championships. The IU athletics endowment is $42 million, the largest in the Big Ten.[145] The Varsity Club, which is the fundraising arm of the Athletics Department, drew a record $11.5 million in gifts and pledges in fiscal year 2004–05. Also, overall annual giving has increased by 8.3 percent in the last year and 44.8 percent in the last three years. In addition to its rich tradition in intervarsity sports, IU also boasts a strong reputation in many non-varsity sports. Many of these ""club"" teams, especially those in ice hockey and rugby union, have achieved a great deal of success in intercollegiate competition. Hurling has also become more popular, with the Indiana University Hurling Club becoming the first American national champions in history.[146] The consistent success of these athletic clubs has several times led the university to establish varsity programs in sports in which there had previously not been a team for NCAA intervarsity competition. The statue of Herman B. Wells A large percentage of the IU student body regularly participates in both formal and/or informal intramural sports, including football, soccer, tennis, basketball, and golf. Among intramural athletics, IU's reputation for student participation and instruction in the martial arts is particularly strong.[citation needed] Media[edit] This section does not cite any sources.

IEN’s activities include building the capacity of Indigenous communities and tribal governments to develop mechanisms to protect our sacred sites, land, water, air, natural resources, health of both our people and all living things, and to build economically sustainable communities.IEN accomplishes this by maintaining an informational clearinghouse, organizing campaigns, direct actions and public awareness, building the capacity of community and tribes to address EJ issues, development of initiatives to impact policy, and building alliances among Indigenous communities, tribes, inter-tribal and Indigenous organizations, people-of-color/ethnic organizations, faith-based and women groups, youth, labor, environmental organizations and others. IEN convenes local, regional and national meetings on environmental and economic justice issues, and provides support, resources and referral to Indigenous communities and youth throughout primarily North America – and in recent years – globally.

This marks a significant expansion from the 570,000 bbl/day it sought approval to transport when applying for a federal permit in 2016. Its existing federal permit, which allowed DAPL to cross beneath Lake Oahe on a dammed portion of the Missouri River near the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe reservation, was invalidated last year with a federal court decision in litigation brought by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. If the company is currently transporting an increased volume of oil through the pipeline, there is no indication that it sought a new permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to do so. This news comes just weeks after a federal enforcement action targeting Energy Transfer for violating safety regulations. “This pipeline operator lost its permit because Standing Rock’s concerns were ignored, and federal environmental laws flouted, when the pipeline was first installed. Now with increased capacity, the threat to our health and drinking water supply has only grown. We look to the Biden administration to take action,” said Ira Taken Alive, Vice-Chair of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. “Energy Transfer is running an illegal pipeline with no permit and that is subject to federal enforcement action for violating safety laws,” said Earthjustice attorney Jan Hasselman, who is representing the Tribe in court. “Expanding operations is a slap in the face to the community. How long before the Biden administration steps in to put an end to this?” Additional Resources Legal Explainer on Standing Rock Litigation against Dakota Access Pipeline Related case documents & news About the Northwest Office About Earthjustice Earthjustice is the premier nonprofit environmental law organization.

(August 2017) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Indigenous Environmental NetworkFormation1990 (1990)HeadquartersBemidji, Minnesota, U.S.Exec. Dir.Tom B.K. GoldtoothWebsiteienearth.org The Indigenous Environmental Network (IEN) is a coalition of indigenous, grassroots environmental justice activists, primarily based in the United States. Group members have represented Native American concerns at international events such as the United Nations Climate Change conferences in Copenhagen (2009) and Paris (2016). IEN organizes an annual conference to discuss proposed goals and projects for the coming year; each year the conference is held in a different indigenous nation.[1] The network emphasizes environmental protection as a form of spiritual activism. IEN received attention in the news as a major organizer of the fight against the Keystone Pipeline and the Dakota Access Pipeline in the Dakota Access Pipeline protests. Contents 1 History 1.1 Ties to environmental justice movement 1.2 Past 1.3 Current activism 2 Goals and beliefs 2.1 Beliefs in practice 3 Spiritual activism 4 Environmental justice 4.1 Opposition to pipelines 4.2 Conferences 4.3 Other work 5 References History[edit] The Indigenous Environmental Network was formed in 1990 to bring to light environmental and economic injustices faced specifically by the indigenous peoples of North America.[2] Ties to environmental justice movement[edit] The environmental justice movement seeks to address issues of environmental racism, which arises when people of color and other marginalized populations such as indigenous peoples are disproportionately affected by exposure to hazardous environmental conditions; the unavailability of safe, healthy, and affordable food options; and exclusion from participatory involvement in community decision-making.[citation needed] Indigenous peoples have historically suffered injustice through environmental racism, having faced repeated despoliation of sacred lands as well as over-exploitation of resources by governments and other actors. This includes dumping, establishment of toxic waste sites, or development of environmentally harmful infrastructure (such as pipelines), specifically on Native American reservations and First Nations reserves. Breaches of indigenous autonomy by the U.S. government are often justified by the claim that the development of indigenous lands would increase economic opportunity for locals—claims that are rarely supported by evidence. Indigenous residents and custodians usually see development projects imposed in this manner as an infringement on their right to self-determination and religious freedom.[3] Past[edit] The Indigenous Environmental Network has focused its activism on improving indigenous communities through grassroots efforts; prioritizing projects that protect the land, air, water, sacred sites, and natural resources. To accomplish the preservation of these assets, the network has organized campaigns, public awareness, and community building activities. The IEN meets locally, regionally, and nationally to promote awareness about issues of social justice, but primarily holds focus in North America.[4] The increase in toxic waste and nuclear waste storage facilities near indigenous lands was a main concern to the IEN during its beginnings in the early 1990s.[4] After the initial focus on environmental hazards presented by these facilities, the network spread awareness across youth and tribal populations that paved the way for it to progress to campaigns and public activism. Every year, a conference is held entitled ""Protecting Mother Earth Gatherings"", which is aimed at educating the public as well as developing strategies for protecting the lands of indigenous peoples. In 1995, IEN began hiring staff to represent the ideologies and goals of the organization. IEN workers strive for the preservation of indigenous peoples through tribal grassroots communities and tribal-government environmental staff. IEN has since evolved into a group that works to create change and strengthen tribal communities by protecting and preserving sacred sites.[4] Current activism[edit] One of the popular cases of activism that IEN has participated in were the protests against the North Dakota Pipeline project, which is set to run through North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa and to end in Illinois. The IEN has been a leading participant in coordinating international action such as bank divestments and days of emergency action that protest fascism and the use of fossil fuels that disrupt the livelihood of indigenous peoples.[4] Indigenous Rising Media is an IEN Project that works to defend the rights of indigenous peoples. It focuses on protecting the sanctity and integrity of Mother Earth and the movement towards a more just and sustainable future.[5] The project has placed information about the North Dakota Pipeline on its website aimed at combating the dangers that directly affect indigenous people. The group also recently participated in the Peoples Climate March on Washington, D.C. on April 29, 2017. The March was hosted to bring to light the dangers of climate change, and IEN supported the event. The rally was hosted by Dallas Goldtooth, a prominent activist protesting against the North Dakota Pipeline, along with Carrie Fulton, an African-American environmental-justice organizer.[6] The Peoples Climate March took place on the 100th day of Donald Trump's presidency, and served as a protest to policy changes being made regarding environmental protection and conservation. Goals and beliefs[edit] This image shows an interview being conducted of members of the Indigenous Environmental Network Tom Goldtooth of the Indigenous Environmental Network has an overview of his position on US drilling and native lands. Educate and empower Indigenous Peoples to address and develop strategies for the protection of our environment, our health, and all life forms – the Circle of Life. Re-affirm our traditional knowledge and respect of natural laws. Recognize, support, and promote environmentally sound lifestyles, economic livelihoods and to build healthy sustaining Indigenous communities. Commitment to influence policies that affect Indigenous Peoples on a local, tribal, state, regional, national and international level. Include youth and elders in all levels of our work. Protect our human rights to practice our cultural and spiritual beliefs.[2] Beliefs in practice[edit] Certain practices of coal mining, oil drilling, and fishing and hunting in the United States are said to directly infringe upon Native land and values. IEN tries to engage with the American public by raising consciousness about environmental issues that are known to have a particularly strong impact on indigenous peoples. One IEN action for this purpose was dedicating a day, October 13, 1996, to challenging Americans to consume as little energy as possible. The goal of this was to encourage people to think about how much energy they do in fact consume on a daily basis and how this impacts on native communities.[7] In 1991, at Bear Butte, South Dakota (a sacred site to many of the Plains Indians), the IEN established an Environmental Code of Ethics.[1] Key points include that indigenous people culturally, and Native Americans politically, are tied to their land; Native Americans in the United States and Canada are restricted to reservations if they want to maintain any kind of nationalistic ideals; and that indigenous people often have religious or ancestral ties to specific tracts of land.[1] This unique relationship makes it less likely for them to leave, makes the land more valuable, and makes them even more staunchly opposed to polluting it in any way.[1] Spiritual activism[edit] The IEN states that part of their mission is to protect and maintain sites sacred to, primarily, indigenous communities in North America. In addressing perceived injustices perpetuated against these peoples, they list protection of sacred, historical and culturally significant areas as one of their main goals. In doing so, they reference their love for Mother Earth as a driving force behind their activism. IEN recognizes humanity's connection to the Earth and believes their activism is restoring and furthering this connection.[8] The group holds ""Protecting Mother Earth Gatherings"", in which they discuss techniques and plans for protecting indigenous communities and lands. In their ""Rights of Mother Earth"" conference held in April 2004, they expressed their commitment in ""creating a system of jurisprudence that sees and treats nature and Mother Earth as a fundamental, rights bearing entity."" They also argued for a paradigm founded on indigenous thought as well as a philosophy that grants equal rights to nature and honors the interrelationship of all life forms on the planet.[9] Environmental justice[edit] Opposition to pipelines[edit] The group began garnering more public attention in 2014, when they began a protest against the Keystone XL oil pipeline. Initial disputes over the pipeline had drawn the attention of the American public in 2011, when groups became concerned that the oil pipeline could contaminate nearby water sources, but this increased as the building of the pipeline was delayed. IEN was one of the larger organizations involved in the debate over the pipeline, allying with other environmentalist groups like the Sierra Club and 350.org.[10] IEN experienced another surge of media exposure in 2015 as protests against the Dakota Access oil pipeline gained attention. The pipeline is currently complete, with the exception of the section mapped to be located under Lake Oahe, which is a major water source for the native Sioux tribe of Standing Rock in North Dakota. After a federal order requiring protesters to leave the build sites of the pipeline, IEN stated publicly that they would not follow the order in an attempt to further delay the progression of the pipeline. Dallas Goldtooth, an organizer with IEN, told a reporter for The Washington Post that ""We are staying here, committed to our prayer. Forced removal and state oppression? This is nothing new to us as native people.""[11] Tom B.K. Goldtooth, founder of IEN, stated after President Donald Trump signed an executive order for the continuation of the building of the pipeline that ""Donald Trump will not build his Dakota Access Pipeline without a fight. The granting of an easement, without any environmental review or tribal consultation, is not the end of this fight—it is the new beginning.""[12] Conferences[edit] IEN hosts annual conferences called the ""Protecting Mother Earth Gatherings"". The first conference was held in 1990 in Bear Butte, South Dakota. The conferences has changed location almost every year. At the conference, members of the IEN come together to discuss the group's goals and projects in the upcoming year. Their resolutions are typically published on the internet soon after the end of each conference.[13] Past conference locations and projects include: The 1992 conference in Celilo Falls, Oregon, formerly a major salmon fishing site until dams were constructed on the Columbia River, downstream from the Hanford Nuclear Reservation. The 1993 conference at Sac and Fox Reservation, Oklahoma; IEN helped defeat a proposal for the establishment of a nuclear waste site. The 1994 conference on Mole Lake Indian Reservation, Wisconsin, where Exxon plans to open a huge zinc-copper mine upstream from the Mole Lake Chippewa's wild rice beds. The 2001 conference (the 12th Protecting Mother Earth Gathering) in Penticton, British Columbia, Canada, was the first to be held in Canada. The 2004 conference was again held near sacred Bear Butte, South Dakota.[14] In 2009, IEN introduced the ""Red Road to Copenhagen"" initiative; a delegation attended the 15th Session of the Conference of the Parties (COP-15) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Copenhagen. The Initiative statement reads: ""...this initiative will bring accumulated traditional knowledge of Indigenous peoples from North America coming from climate-energy impact zones and persons experienced in linking an indigenous rights-based framework to climate policy.""[15] IEN prioritizes multigenerational and intertribal organizing, and has specific youth and elders groups. It is governed partly by an Elders Council; their Youth Council solicits the involvement of young indigenous people and tries to make connections between urban youth culture and environmental issues faced by the communities.[16] Members of IEN were involved in the 2016 Dakota Access Pipeline protests, notably in the media coverage and in establishing the media tent at the Oceti Sakowin camp.[17] Other work[edit] The POPs Treaty, now known as the Stockholm Convention after it was signed in May 2001 in Sweden, was designed to ban a number of pesticides and other chemicals from use. During the negotiations, IEN played a key role in expressing to delegates what indigenous peoples wanted from the treaty. Throughout the period, the IEN met with delegates from all over the world in order to sensitise them on how indigenous peoples are impacted by POPs and their expectations from the treaty.[18] Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) is a policy mechanism designed to work for the preservation of global forests and it is backed by many influential environmental organizations like Greenpeace and Conservation International. REDD is centered around the idea of providing forest owners with financial incentive to preserve them. However, in accomplishing this, it also requires the relocation of indigenous peoples who reside in forests that are being targeted and is therefore very controversial among grassroots and indigenous organizations. IEN publicly opposes REDD, claiming that it is a direct violation of the rights of indigenous peoples to have autonomy over their own land.[19] References[edit] ^ a b c d Brook, Daniel (January 1998).

Established in 1990 within the United States, IEN was formed by grassroots Indigenous peoples and individuals to address environmental and economic justice issues (EJ). IEN’s activities include building the capacity of Indigenous communities and tribal governments to develop mechanisms to protect our sacred sites, land, water, air, natural resources, health of both our people and all living things, and to build economically sustainable communities.IEN accomplishes this by maintaining an informational clearinghouse, organizing campaigns, direct actions and public awareness, building the capacity of community and tribes to address EJ issues, development of initiatives to impact policy, and building alliances among Indigenous communities, tribes, inter-tribal and Indigenous organizations, people-of-color/ethnic organizations, faith-based and women groups, youth, labor, environmental organizations and others. IEN convenes local, regional and national meetings on environmental and economic justice issues, and provides support, resources and referral to Indigenous communities and youth throughout primarily North America – and in recent years – globally.

Her MSc in Botany had as its focus the sustainable harvesting of wild rooibos in the Suid Bokkeveld –  a study for which she relied heavily on the input of small-scale producers in the region. Rhoda made her home in Nieuwoudtville between 2005 and 2008, serving as a Member of the Board since its inception in 2006. Since her move back to Cape Town, Rhoda has taken up a lecturing position with the Department of Conservation Ecology and Entomology at Stellenbosch University. She now lectures on the subjects that she distilled from her experiences during her postgraduate studies: community based natural resource management, sustainable agriculture, sustainable management of terrestrial species. Her interest in Social-Ecological Systems (SES’s) and the relationships between people and their natural environments still form the core of her academic interests. Siyabonga Myeza (Vice Chair) graduated in conservation and joined the Indigo board in 2019. He has been working in the environmental sectors with the Environmental Monitoring Group for many years – first based in the local office in Nieuwoudtville and currently based in the EMG head office in Cape Town. Bettina Koelle (Treasurer) graduated with a Master degree at the Free University of Berlin (Germany) in 1997 and has been working as a development practitioner in the field for more than 15 years. With a strong passion for participatory approaches she has supported the development of various participatory methodologies to support an action research approach linking grassroots processes to global debate, specifically focusing on linking local adaptation action to the climate negotiations and the IPCC process by providing input and case studies from the field. In this context her focus has been on marginalized groups and especially women. Bettina was the director of Indigo for 11 years, from 2006-2017. Shannon Brandt (Secretary ) has been a staff member of Indigo development & change since the early days. With a strong passion for conservation and environmental education, Shannon developed the climate change programme within Indigo, and is director of Indigo since 2017.

The United Nations proclaimed May 22 as the International Day for Biological Diversity (IDB) to increase understanding and awareness of biodiversity issues (www.cbd.int/idb). As the global community is called to re-examine its relationship to the natural world, one thing is certain: despite all our technological advances we are completely dependent on healthy and vibrant ecosystems for our water, food, medicines, clothes,... fuel, shelter and energy, just to name a few. The theme “Our solutions are in nature” emphasizes hope, solidarity and the importance of working together at all levels to build a future of life in harmony with nature. 2020 is a year of reflection, opportunity and solutions. It is the year where, more than ever, the world can signal a strong will for a global framework that will “bend the curve” on biodiversity loss for the benefit of humans and all life on Earth.

We started off with an energizer (Ismail always has a plan on this). After a boost of energy we calmed them down by showing the fascinating documentary by the legendary David Attenborough -The private life of plants. This did not only fascinate the kids but had us captivated as well. We had the kids make paper flowers and took a walk to a nearby patch of veld where we stuck these in the ground, awaiting pollinators (I was highly fascinated that this actually worked 😎). As we know having 10 energy boosters under your wing exhausts you so we had them color in (Shew a well deserved break!).

Start fundraising Charity profile Indigo is based in Nieuwoudtville, a small town in the Northern Cape which is at the intersection of two Global Biodiversity Hotspots: the Cape Floristic Kingdom and the Succulent Karoo. Most of its inhabitants are historically disadvantaged and socio-economic opportunities are scarce and/or unknown. Many researchers and scientists have been coming to the area to conduct research on biodiversity conservation, climate change, plant diversity and other topics. However the research was usually not accessible to local farmers, learners and teachers. In order to harness the exceptional biodiversity, promote responsible stewardship of these natural treasures and open up opportunities for better livelihoods for the locals associated to sustainable use of natural resources, Indigo facilitates local action amongst members of rural communities with the ultimate focus on empowerment of marginalised groups and simultaneous promotion of social and environmental justice. Community trust has being built throughout the years based on a sound working relationship. Indigo works with participatory learning and action methodologies aimed to truly empower individuals throughout allowing them to indentify their own problems and find local tangible, sustainable and lasting solutions. Our activities indeed are guided by the local needs and requests. We don’t work in isolation but together with a diverse range of national and international partners from the non-profit, academic and government arenas. We do our work through implementing three programmes on a daily basis: Climate Change Adaptation Sustainable Natural Resource Management & Biodiversity Conservation, and Training and Capacity Development.

We are committed to linking the local processes to global dialogue and policy – and thus are engaging locally in all programmes, while reaching out to national and global policy processes. Where does the name Indigo come from? The organisation is named after the plant Indigofera disticha, a legume that occurs widely in South Africa and is know as being a useful pioneer plant, fixing nitrogen in the soil. It grows prolific after rain and is very drought resistant. This plant even provides some feed in drought and the feed value is high. This reflects our vision of being a catalyst for positive change for marginalised groups. You can spot this plant in our logo. Where do we work? Local Working with Rooibos small farmers in the Suid Bokkeveld is one of our key priorities – focusing on adaptation, sustainable resource use and stewardship and biodiversity conservation. Global We are actively engaging in global policy processes and have official UNFCCC observer status since 2011.

104,"IndustriALL Global Union - Wikipedia IndustriALL Global Union From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search IndustriALL Global UnionFounded19 June 2012HeadquartersGeneva, SwitzerlandLocationInternationalMembers 50 millionKey peopleJörg Hofmann, presidentValter Sanches, general secretaryAffiliationsCouncil of Global UnionsWebsitewww.industriall-union.org IndustriALL Global Union is a global union federation, founded in Copenhagen on 19 June 2012. IndustriALL Global Union represents more than 50 million working people in more than 140 countries, working across the supply chains in mining, energy and manufacturing sectors at the global level. Contents 1 History 2 Strategy 3 Bangladesh Accord 4 Living wage campaign 5 Global Framework Agreements 6 Leadership 6.1 General Secretaries 6.2 Presidents 6.3 Other leaders 7 External links History[edit] The IndustriALL Global Union is the result of a merger between three former global union federations: IMF, International Metalworkers' Federation ICEM, International Federation of Chemical, Energy, Mine and General Workers' Unions ITGLWF, International Textile, Garment and Leather Workers' Federation Many IndustriALL Global Union affiliates are also members of the IndustriAll - European Trade Union. Although they are separate organisations, both cooperate on issues of common interest. Strategy[edit] IndustriALL is an international union confederation made up of approximately 600 unions in 140 countries. The organisation's goals are: Defend workers' rights Build union power Confront global capital Fight precarious work Promote sustainable industrial policy A major part of the organisation's work is building international company networks, where union activists from different countries who work for the same company can meet and share strategies. Bangladesh Accord[edit] IndustriALL represents workers in the garment and textile sector. After the Rana Plaza industrial disaster, when a building collapse killed 1,134 people, IndustriALL and UNI Global Union negotiated the Bangladesh Accord. The Accord is a legally binding safety and inspection mechanism for garment and textile factories in Bangladesh. The Accord was signed by more than 200 brands who source from Bangladesh. The agreement was renewed in 2017. Living wage campaign[edit] Poverty wages have a devastating impact on workers; in Cambodia thousands of malnourished workers have fainted in the last 2 years and in Bangladesh workers are being forced to survive on a dollar a day. From Africa to Asia and Latin America the Living Wage is a global issue and central to the Decent Work Agenda. IndustriALL is campaigning on this issue with its affiliates. Global Framework Agreements[edit] Main article: Global Framework Agreement GFAs are negotiated on a global level between trade unions and a multinational company and serve to protect the interests of workers across a multinational company’s operations. They put in place the very best standards of trade union rights, health, safety and environmental practices, and quality of work principles across a company's global operations, regardless of whether those standards exist in an individual country. IndustriALL prioritizes establishing, monitoring and improving GFAs with multinational companies, including Volkswagen, Inditex, Gamesa, Siemens and AngloGold.

We take no responsibility for the accuracy of the translation.Belarus: fight continues for democracy and labour rightsAdd to favouritesRead this article in:EnglishРусскийEspañolFrançais9 August, 20219 August marks the one-year anniversary of the rigged presidential elections in Belarus which have led to intensified repression and intimidation of civil society, as well as a complete disrespect of fundamental human and workers' rights.Since last year’s elections, the Belarusian regime has cracked down on core civil liberties: freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of association. Today’s anniversary shows the need for stronger intervention and solidarity by the international community.Independent unions in Belarus have always been at the forefront of the struggle for fundamental rights and democracy and have been hit hard by the repressive regime. Since August 2020, independent union leaders, activists and members have been intimidated, detained, sentenced to lengthy administrative arrests and fined. Union offices have been raided by police, homes of union leaders and activists have been searched, and some have had to flee the country.Under the threat of liquidation, authorities are forcing private companies to establish pro-governmental unions, in violation of the ILO Convention 87.Workers have been laid off for joining an independent union of their choice, for attempting to strike, or for participating in peaceful protests. Some workers have received heavy prison sentences for exercising their fundamental rights.For their fearless struggle in such harsh, undemocratic conditions, three IndustriALL affiliates, Belarusian Independent Trade Union (BITU), Free Metal Workers’ Union (SPM) and Belarusian Radio and Electronic Industry Workers' Union (REP),  were awarded the Arthur Svensson international prize for trade union rights, as part of the Belarusian Congress of Democratic Trade Unions (BKDP).As part of its  support and solidarity with its Belarussian affiliates, IndustriALL has taken initiatives vis-à-vis  Belarussian authorities, demanding the release of unlawfully detained unionists and calling for an end to the intimidation, pressure, violation and imprisonment of independent union leaders and striking workers. IndustriALL has interacted  with employers demanding an end to the intimidation and unfair dismissals of workers and to re-instate workers.Together with other global unions, IndustriALL has compiled a list of companies doing business in Belarus and urged them to conduct due diligence on violations of human and labour rights.IndustriALL has called on the ILO,  the European Union and intergovernmental agencies for their urgent intervention to protect freedom of association and stop repression against independent trade union leaders and activists in Belarus. The European Union has imposed sectoral sanctions on Belarus, and the USA is about to unveil new sanctions against Belarus .IndustriALL assistant general secretary Kemal Özkan says:“We reiterate our commitment to fight for workers’ rights and democratic values and our support for Belarus’ independent unions and civil society. The regime  in the country must respect fundamental rights and freedoms and comply with international obligations. We will continue to struggle until the justice has arrived.” BelarusBuilding strong unionsViolationWorkers' rightsRelated ArticlesAbout IndustriALLIndustriALL Global Union’s affiliates represent over 50 million workers in 140 countries in the mining, energy and manufacturing sectors.We take up the fight for better working conditions and trade union rights around the world.Who we areWhat we doWhere to find usFollow usJoin the movement and follow us on:FacebookTwitterYoutubeInstagram[email protected]Contact usFor questions and press enquiries:[email protected][email protected]© Copyright 2018 - IndustriALL - We care about your personal information and data.

The municipality (ville de Genève) has a population (as of December 2019[update]) of 203,951, and the canton (essentially the city and its inner-ring suburbs) has 504,128 residents.[5] In 2014, the compact agglomération du Grand Genève had 946,000 inhabitants in 212 communities in both Switzerland and France.[6] Within Swiss territory, the commuter area named ""Métropole lémanique"" contains a population of 1.26 million.[7][8] This area is essentially spread east from Geneva towards the Riviera area (Vevey, Montreux) and north-east towards Yverdon-les-Bains, in the neighbouring canton of Vaud. Geneva is a global city, a financial centre, and a worldwide centre for diplomacy due to the presence of numerous international organizations, including the headquarters of many agencies of the United Nations[9] and the Red Cross.[10] Geneva hosts the highest number of international organizations in the world.[11] It is also where the Geneva Conventions were signed, which chiefly concern the treatment of wartime non-combatants and prisoners of war. Together with, for instance, New York City (global headquarters of the UN), Basel (Bank for International Settlements), and Strasbourg (Council of Europe), Geneva is a city serving as the headquarters of one of the most important international organizations, without being the capital of a country.[12][13][14] In 2021, Geneva was ranked as the world's ninth most important financial centre for competitiveness by the Global Financial Centres Index, fifth in Europe behind London, Zürich, Frankfurt and Luxembourg.[15] In 2019, Geneva was ranked among the ten most liveable cities in the world by Mercer together with Zürich and Basel.[16] The city has been referred to as the world's most compact metropolis[17] and the ""Peace Capital"".[18] In 2019, Mercer ranked Geneva as the thirteenth most expensive city in the world.[19] In a UBS ranking of global cities in 2018, Geneva was ranked first for gross earnings, second most expensive, and fourth in purchasing power.[20] Contents 1 Name 2 History 3 Geography 3.1 Topography 3.2 Climate 4 Politics 4.1 Coat of arms 4.2 Administrative divisions 4.3 Government 4.4 Parliament 4.5 Elections 4.5.1 National Council 4.6 International relations 5 Demographics 5.1 Population 5.2 Historical population 5.3 Religion 5.3.1 ""Protestant Rome"" 5.4 Crime 6 Cityscape 7 Heritage sites of national significance 8 Society and culture 8.1 Media 8.2 Traditions and customs 8.3 Music and festivals 9 Education 10 Economy 11 Sport 12 Infrastructure 12.1 Transportation 12.2 Utilities 13 International organisations 14 Notable people 14.1 A–C 14.2 D–G 14.3 H–M 14.4 N-R 14.5 S–Z 15 See also 16 Notes and references 17 Bibliography 18 External links Name[edit] The city was mentioned in Latin texts, by Caesar, with the spelling Genava,[21] probably from the Celtic *genawa- from the stem *genu- (""bend, knee""), in the sense of a bending river or estuary, an etymology shared with the Italian port city of Genoa (in Italian Genova).[22] The medieval county of Geneva in Middle Latin was known as pagus major Genevensis or Comitatus Genevensis (also Gebennensis). After 1400 it became the Genevois province of Savoy (albeit not extending to the city proper, until the reformation of the seat of the Bishop of Geneva).[23] History[edit] Main articles: History of Geneva and Timeline of Geneva For the Catholic ecclesiastical history, see bishopric of Geneva. A view of Geneva by Frances Elizabeth Wynne, 4 August 1858 L'Escalade is what Genevans call the failed surprise attack of 12 December 1602 by troops sent by Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy, to take Geneva. This imaginative image was drawn by Matthias Quad, or the workshop of Frans Hogenberg, around 1603. Invaders are pictured crossing the moat in the center left while reinforcements are entering Plainpalais at the bottom. A column of defenders is in the center, headed toward the Savoyards. Lake Léman is at center top. Geneva was an Allobrogian border town, fortified against the Helvetii tribe,[24] when the Romans took it in 121 BC. It became Christian under the Late Roman Empire, and acquired its first bishop in the 5th century, having been connected to the Bishopric of Vienne in the 4th. Aerial view (1966) In the Middle Ages, Geneva was ruled by a count under the Holy Roman Empire until the late 14th century, when it was granted a charter giving it a high degree of self-governance. Around this time, the House of Savoy came to at least nominally dominate the city. In the 15th century, an oligarchic republican government emerged with the creation of the Grand Council. In the first half of the 16th century, the Protestant Reformation reached the city, causing religious strife, during which Savoy rule was thrown off and Geneva allied itself with the Swiss Confederacy. In 1541, with Protestantism on the rise, John Calvin, the Protestant Reformer and proponent of Calvinism, became the spiritual leader of the city and established the Republic of Geneva. By the 18th century, Geneva had come under the influence of Catholic France, which cultivated the city as its own. France tended to be at odds with the ordinary townsfolk, which inspired the failed Geneva Revolution of 1782, an attempt to win representation in the government for men of modest means. In 1798, revolutionary France under the Directory annexed Geneva. At the end of the Napoleonic Wars, on 1 June 1814, Geneva was admitted to the Swiss Confederation. In 1907, the separation of Church and State was adopted. Geneva flourished in the 19th and 20th centuries, becoming the seat of many international organizations.[25] Geography[edit] Topography[edit] Satellite view of Geneva; Cointrin Airport is centre left. Geneva is located at 46°12' North, 6°09' East, at the south-western end of Lake Geneva, where the Rhône flows out. It is surrounded by three mountain chains, each belonging to the Jura: the Jura main range lies north-westward, the Vuache southward, and the Salève south-eastward. The Geneva area seen from the Salève in France. The Jura mountains are on the horizon. The city covers an area of 15.93 km2 (6.2 sq mi), while the area of the canton is 282 km2 (108.9 sq mi), including the two small exclaves of Céligny in Vaud. The part of the lake that is attached to Geneva has an area of 38 km2 (14.7 sq mi) and is sometimes referred to as petit lac (small lake). The canton has only a 4.5-kilometre-long (2.8 mi) border with the rest of Switzerland. Of 107.5 km (66.8 mi) of border, 103 are shared with France, the Département de l'Ain to the north and west and the Département de la Haute-Savoie to the south and east. Of the land in the city, 0.24 km2 (0.093 sq mi), or 1.5%, is used for agricultural purposes, while 0.5 km2 (0.19 sq mi), or 3.1%, is forested. The rest of the land, 14.63 km2 (5.65 sq mi), or 91.8%, is built up (buildings or roads), 0.49 km2 (0.19 sq mi), or 3.1%, is either rivers or lakes and 0.02 km2 (4.9 acres), or 0.1%, is wasteland.[26] Of the built up area, industrial buildings made up 3.4%, housing and buildings made up 46.2% and transportation infrastructure 25.8%, while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 15.7%. Of the agricultural land, 0.3% is used for growing crops. Of the water in the municipality, 0.2% is composed of lakes and 2.9% is rivers and streams.[26] Confluence of the Rhône and the Arve The altitude of Geneva is 373.6 metres (1,225.7 ft) and corresponds to the altitude of the largest of the Pierres du Niton, two large rocks emerging from the lake which date from the last ice age. This rock was chosen by General Guillaume Henri Dufour as the reference point for surveying in Switzerland.[27] The second main river of Geneva is the Arve, which flows into the Rhône just west of the city centre. Mont Blanc can be seen from Geneva and is an hour's drive from the city. Climate[edit] Average temperature and precipitation 1961–1990[28] The climate of Geneva is a temperate climate, more specifically an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification: Cfb). Winters are cool, usually with light frosts at night and thawing conditions during the day. Summers are relatively warm. Precipitation is adequate and is relatively well-distributed throughout the year, although autumn is slightly wetter than other seasons. Ice storms near Lac Léman are normal in the winter: Geneva can be affected by the Bise, a north-easterly wind. This can lead to severe icing in winter.[29] In summer, many people swim in the lake and patronise public beaches such as Genève Plage and the Bains des Pâquis. The city, in certain years, receives snow during colder months. The nearby mountains are subject to substantial snowfall and are suitable for skiing. Many world-renowned ski resorts such as Verbier and Crans-Montana are less than three hours away by car. Mont Salève (1,379 m (4,524 ft)), just across the border in France, dominates the southerly view from the city centre, and Mont Blanc, the highest of the Alpine range, is visible from most of the city, towering high above Chamonix, which, along with Morzine, Le Grand Bornand, La Clusaz, and resorts of the Grand Massif such as Samoens, Morillon, and Flaine, are the closest French skiing destinations to Geneva. During the years 2000–2009, the mean yearly temperature was 11 °C and the mean number of sunshine-hours per year was 2003.[30] The highest temperature recorded in Genève–Cointrin was 39.7 °C (103.5 °F) in July 2015, and the lowest temperature recorded was −20.0 °C (−4.0 °F) in February 1956.

It is composed of five councilors (French: Conseiller administratif/ Conseillère administrative), each presiding over a department. The president of the executive department acts as mayor (la maire/le maire). In the governmental year 2021–2022, the Administrative Council is presided over by Madame la maire de Genève Frédérique Perler. Departmental tasks, coordination measures and implementation of laws decreed by the Municipal Council are carried out by the Administrative Council. Elections for the Administrative Council are held every five years. The current term of (la législature) is from 1 June 2020 to 31 May 2025. The delegates are elected by means of a system of Majorz. The mayor and vice change each year, while the heads of the other departments are assigned by the collegiate. The executive body holds its meetings in the Palais Eynard, near the Parc des Bastions.[36] As of 2020[update], Geneva's Administrative Council is made up of two representatives each of the Social Democratic Party (PS) and the Green Party (PES), and one member of the Christian Democratic Party (PDC). This gives the left-wing parties four out of the five seats and, for the first time in history, a female majority. The last election was held on 15 March/5 April 2020.[37] Except for the mayor, all other councillors have been elected for the first time.[38] Le Conseil administratif of Geneva [38] Councillor(M. Conseiller administratif/ Mme Conseillère administrative) Party Head of Office (Département, since) of elected in Frédérique Perler[SR 1] PES Planning, Construction, and Mobility (de l'aménagement, des constructions et de la mobilité, 2020) 2020 Marie Barbey-Chappuisat[SR 2] PDC Security and Sport (de la sécurité et des sports, 2020) 2020 Sami Kanaan PS Culture and Digital Change (de la culture et de la transition numérique, 2020) 2011 Alfonso Gomez PES Finance, Environment and Housing (des finances, de l'environnement et du logement, 2020) 2020 Christina Kitsos PS Social Cohesion and Solidarity (de la cohésion sociale et de la solidarité, 2020) 2020 ^ Mayor (la maire de Genève) 2021/22 ^ Vice President (Vice-présidente) 2021/22 Parliament[edit] Le Conseil municipal of Geneva for the mandate period of 2020–2025 Ensemble à gauche (PST-POP & Sol) (8.8%)  PS (23.8%)  Les Verts (PES) (22.5%)  PDC (10%)  PLR (17.5%)  UDC (8.8%)  MCG (8.8%) The Municipal Council (Conseil municipal) holds legislative power. It is made up of 80 members, with elections held every five years. The Municipal Council makes regulations and by-laws that are executed by the Administrative Council and the administration. The delegates are selected by means of a system of proportional representation with a seven percent threshold. The sessions of the Municipal Council are public. Unlike members of the Administrative Council, members of the Municipal Council are not politicians by profession, and they are paid a fee based on their attendance. Any resident of Geneva allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the Municipal Council. The Council holds its meetings in the Town Hall (Hôtel de Ville), in the old city.[39] The last election of the Municipal Council was held on 15 March 2020 for the (législature) of 2020–2025. Currently, the Municipal Council consists of: 19 members of the Social Democratic Party (PS), 18 Green Party (PES), 14 Les Libéraux-Radicaux (PLR), 8 Christian Democratic People's Party (PDC); 7 Geneva Citizens' Movement (MCG,), 7 Ensemble à Gauche (an alliance of the left parties PST-POP (Parti Suisse du Travail – Parti Ouvrier et Populaire) and solidaritéS), 6 Swiss People's Party (UDC).[40] Elections[edit] National Council[edit] In the 2019 federal election for the Swiss National Council the most popular party was the Green Party which received 26% (+14.6) of the vote. The next seven most popular parties were the PS (17.9%, -5.9), PLR (15.1%, -2.4), the UDC (12.6%, -3.7), the PdA/solidaritéS (10%, +1.3), the PDC (5.4%, -5.3), the pvl (5%, +2.9), and MCR (4.9%, -2.7).[41] In the federal election a total of 34,319 votes were cast, and the voter turnout was 39.6%.[42] In the 2015 federal election for the Swiss National Council the most popular party was the PS which received 23.8% of the vote. The next five most popular parties were the PLR (17.6%), the UDC (16.3%), the Green Party (11.4%), the PDC (10.7%), and the solidaritéS (8.8%). In the federal election a total of 36,490 votes were cast, and the voter turnout was 44.1%.[43] International relations[edit] Geneva does not have any sister relationships with other cities. It declares itself related to the entire world.[44][45] Demographics[edit] Population[edit] The Flowered Clock at the Quai du Général-Guisan (English Garden), during the 2012 Geneva Festival Rue Pierre-Fatio in Geneva Geneva has a population (as of December 2019[update]) of 203,951.[5] The city of Geneva is at the centre of the Geneva metropolitan area, known as Grand Genève in French (Greater Geneva). Greater Geneva includes the Canton of Geneva, the District of Nyon in the Canton of Vaud and several areas in the French departments of Haute-Savoie and Ain. In 2011, the agglomération franco-valdo-genevoise had 915,000 inhabitants, two-thirds of whom lived on Swiss soil and one-third on French soil.[46] The Geneva metropolitan area is experiencing steady demographic growth of 1.2% a year and the population of the agglomération franco-valdo-genevoise is expected to reach a total of one million people in the near future.[46] The official language of Geneva (both the city and the canton) is French. English is also common due to the high number of anglophone expatriates and foreigners working in international institutions and in the bank sector. As of 2000[update], 128,622 or 72.3% of the population speaks French as a first language, with English being the second most common (7,853 or 4.4%) language. 7,462 inhabitants speak Spanish (or 4.2%), 7,320 speak Italian (4.1%), 7,050 speak German (4.0%) and 113 people who speak Romansh.[47] As a result of immigration flows in the 1960s and 1980s, Portuguese is also spoken by a considerable proportion of the population. In the city of Geneva, as of 2013[update], 48% of the population are resident foreign nationals.[48] For a list of the largest groups of foreign residents see the cantonal overview. Over the last 10 years (1999–2009), the population has changed at a rate of 7.2%; a rate of 3.4% due to migration and at a rate of 3.4% due to births and deaths.[49] As of 2008[update], the gender distribution of the population was 47.8% male and 52.2% female.

There were also 3,959 members of an Orthodox church (2.22%), 220 individuals (or about 0.12% of the population) who belonged to the Christian Catholic Church of Switzerland, 2,422 (1.36%) who belonged to another Christian church, and 2,601 people (1.46%) who were Jewish. There were 707 individuals who were Buddhist, 474 who were Hindu and 423 who belonged to another church. 26,575 respondents (14.93%) did not answer the question.[47] According to 2012 statistics by Swiss Bundesamt für Statistik 49.2% of the population are Christian, divided into 34.2% Catholic, 8.8% Swiss Reformed (organized in the Protestant Church of Geneva) and 6.2% other Christian (mostly various other Protestants), 38% of Genevans are non-religious, 6.1% are Muslim and 1.6% are Jews.[57] Geneva has historically been considered a Protestant city and was known as the Protestant Rome due to it being the base of John Calvin, William Farel, Theodore Beza and other Protestant reformers. Over the past century, substantial immigration from France and other predominantly Catholic countries, as well as general European secularization has changed its religious landscape. As a result, three times as many Roman Catholics as Protestants lived in the city in 2000, while a large number of residents were members of neither group. Geneva forms part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Lausanne, Geneva and Fribourg. The World Council of Churches and the Lutheran World Federation both have their headquarters at the Ecumenical Centre in Grand-Saconnex, Geneva. The World Communion of Reformed Churches, a worldwide organization of Presbyterian, Continental Reformed, Congregational and other Calvinist churches gathering more than 80 million people around the world was based here from 1948 until 2013. The Executive Committee of the World Communion of Reformed Churches voted in 2012 to move its offices to Hanover, Germany, citing the high costs of running the ecumenical organization in Geneva, Switzerland. The move was completed in 2013. Likewise, the Conference of European Churches have moved their headquarters from Geneva to Brussels. ""Protestant Rome""[edit] Reformation Wall in Geneva; from left to right: William Farel, John Calvin, Theodore Beza, and John Knox Prior to the Protestant Reformation the city was de jure and de facto Catholic. Reaction to the new movement varied across Switzerland. John Calvin went to Geneva in 1536 after William Farel encouraged him to do so. In Geneva, the Catholic bishop had been obliged to seek exile in 1532. Geneva became a stronghold of Calvinism. Some of the tenets created there influenced Protestantism as a whole. St. Pierre Cathedral was where Calvin and his Protestant reformers preached. It constituted the epicentre of the newly developing Protestant thought that would later become known as the Reformed tradition. Many prominent Reformed theologians operated there, including William Farel and Theodore Beza, Calvin's successor who progressed Reformed thought after his death. Geneva was a shelter for Calvinists, but at the same time it persecuted Roman Catholics and others considered heretics. The case of Michael Servetus, an early Nontrinitarian, is notable. Condemned by both Catholics and Protestants alike, he was arrested in Geneva and burnt at the stake as a heretic by order of the city's Protestant governing council. John Calvin and his followers denounced him, and possibly contributed to his sentence. In 1802, during its annexation to France under Napoleon I, the Diocese of Geneva was united with the Diocese of Chambéry, but the 1814 Congress of Vienna and the 1816 Treaty of Turin stipulated that in the territories transferred to a now considerably extended Geneva, the Catholic religion was to be protected and that no changes were to be made in existing conditions without an agreement with the Holy See.[24] Napoleon's common policy was to emancipate Catholics in Protestant-majority areas, and the other way around, as well as emancipating Jews. In 1819, the city of Geneva and 20 parishes were united to the Diocese of Lausanne by Pope Pius VII and in 1822, the non-Swiss territory was made into the Diocese of Annecy. A variety of concord with the civil authorities came as a result of the separation of church and state, enacted with strong Catholic support in 1907.[24] Crime[edit] See also: Crime in Switzerland In 2014 the incidence of crimes listed in the Swiss Criminal Code in Geneva was 143.9 per thousand residents. During the same period the rate of drug crimes was 33.6 per thousand residents. The rate of violations of immigration, visa and work permit laws was 35.7 per thousand residents.[58] Cityscape[edit] View of Geneva to the south. Mont Salève (in France) dominates the foreground, with the white summit of Mont Blanc just visible behind it and 70 km (43 mi) away to the southeast. To the left of Mont Blanc is the point of Le Môle. View of Geneva from the Salève.

Le Courrier mainly focuses on Geneva. Both Le Temps (headquartered in Geneva) and Le Matin are widely read in Geneva, but cover the whole of Romandy. Geneva is the main media center for French-speaking Switzerland. It is the headquarters for the numerous French language radio and television networks of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation, known collectively as Radio Télévision Suisse. While both networks cover the whole of Romandy, special programs related to Geneva are sometimes broadcast on some of the local radio frequencies. Other local radio stations broadcast from the city, including YesFM (FM 91.8 MHz), Radio Cité (non-commercial radio, FM 92.2 MHz), OneFM (FM 107.0 MHz, also broadcast in Vaud), and World Radio Switzerland (FM 88.4 MHz). Léman Bleu is a local TV channel, founded in 1996 and distributed by cable. Due to the proximity to France, many French television channels are also available. Traditions and customs[edit] Geneva observes Jeûne genevois on the first Thursday following the first Sunday in September. By local tradition, this commemorates the date news of the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of Huguenots reached Geneva. Geneva celebrates L'Escalade on the weekend nearest 12 December, celebrating the defeat of the surprise attack of troops sent by Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy during the night of 11–12 December 1602. Festive traditions include chocolate cauldrons filled with vegetable-shaped marzipan treats and the Escalade procession on horseback in seventeenth century armour. Geneva has also been organizing a 'Course de l'Escalade', which means 'Climbing Race'. This race takes place in Geneva's Old Town, and has been popular across all ages. Non-competitive racers dress up in fancy costumes, while walking in the race. Since 1818, a particular chestnut tree has been used as the official ""herald of the spring"" in Geneva. The sautier (secretary of the Parliament of the Canton of Geneva) observes the tree and notes the day of arrival of the first bud. While this event has no practical effect, the sautier issues a formal press release and the local newspaper will usually mention the news.[60] As this is one of the world's oldest records of a plant's reaction to climatic conditions, researchers have been interested to note that the first bud has been appearing earlier and earlier in the year. During the 19th century many dates were in March or April. In recent years, they have usually been in late February (sometimes earlier).[61] In 2002, the first bud appeared unusually early, on 7 February, and then again on 29 December of the same year. The following year, one of the hottest years recorded in Europe, was a year with no bud. In 2008, the first bud also appeared early, on 19 February. Music and festivals[edit] Fireworks at the Fêtes de Genève, 2012 The opera house, the Grand Théâtre de Genève, which officially opened in 1876, was partly destroyed by a fire in 1951 and reopened in 1962. It has the largest stage in Switzerland. It features opera and dance performances, recitals, concerts and, occasionally, theatre. The Victoria Hall is used for classical music concerts. It is the home of the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande. Every summer the Fêtes de Genève (Geneva Festival) are organised in Geneva. According to Radio Télévision Suisse in 2013 hundreds of thousands of people came to Geneva to see the annual hour-long grand firework display of the Fêtes de Genève.[62] An annual music festival takes place in June. Groups of artists perform in different parts of the city. In 2016 the festival celebrated its 25th anniversary.[63] Further annual festivals are the Fête de l'Olivier, a festival of Arabic music, organized by the ICAM since 1980,[64] and the Genevan Brass Festival, founded by Christophe Sturzenegger in 2010.[65] Education[edit] Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies The Canton of Geneva's public school system has écoles primaires (ages 4–12) and cycles d'orientation (ages 12–15). Students can leave school at 15, but secondary education is provided by collèges (ages 15–19), the oldest of which is the Collège Calvin, which could be considered one of the oldest public schools in the world,[62][66] écoles de culture générale (15–18/19) and the écoles professionnelles (15–18/19). The écoles professionnelles offer full-time courses and part-time study as part of an apprenticeship. Geneva also has a number of private schools.[67] In 2011 89,244 (37.0%) of the population had completed non-mandatory upper secondary education, and 107,060 or (44.3%) had completed additional higher education (either university or a Fachhochschule). Of the 107,060 who completed tertiary schooling, 32.5% were Swiss men, 31.6% were Swiss women, 18.1% were non-Swiss men and 17.8% were non-Swiss women. During the 2011–2012 school year, there were a total of 92,311 students in the Geneva school system (primary to university). The education system in the Canton of Geneva has eight years of primary school, with 32,716 students. The secondary school program consists of three lower, obligatory years of schooling, followed by three to five years of optional, advanced study. There were 13,146 lower-secondary students who attended schools in Geneva. There were 10,486 upper-secondary students from the municipality along with 10,330 students who were in a professional, non-university track program. An additional 11,797 students were attending private schools.[68] The University of Geneva. Geneva is home to the University of Geneva where approximately 16,500 students are regularly enrolled.[69] In 1559 John Calvin founded the Geneva Academy, a theological and humanist seminary. In the 19th century the Academy lost its ecclesiastic links and in 1873, with the addition of a medical faculty, it became the University of Geneva. In 2011 it was ranked 35th European university.[70] The Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies was among the first academic institutions in the World to teach international relations. It is one of Europe's most prestigious institutions, offering MA and PhD programmes in law, political science, history, economics, international affairs, and development studies. The oldest international school in the world is the International School of Geneva, founded in 1924 along with the League of Nations. The Geneva School of Diplomacy and International Relations is a private university in the grounds of the Château de Penthes. CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research) is probably the best known of Geneva's educational and research facilities, most recently for the Large Hadron Collider. Founded in 1954, CERN was one of Europe's first joint ventures and has developed as the world's largest particle physics laboratory. Physicists from around the world travel to CERN to research matter and explore the fundamental forces and materials that form the universe. Geneva is home to five major libraries, the Bibliothèques municipales Genève, the Haute école de travail social, Institut d'études sociales, the Haute école de santé, the Ecole d'ingénieurs de Genève and the Haute école d'art et de design. There were (as of 2008[update]) 877,680 books or other media in the libraries, and in the same year 1,798,980 items were loaned.[71] Economy[edit] Geneva's economy is largely service-driven and closely linked to the rest of the canton. The city is often ranked as one of the strongest global financial centres, ranking 9th in the world in 2020[72] and 2nd in Europe behind London. Three main sectors dominate the financial sector: commodity trading; trade finance, and wealth management. Around a third of the world's free traded oil, sugar, grains and oil seeds is traded in Geneva. Approximately 22% of the world's cotton is traded in the Lake Geneva region. Other major commodities traded in the canton include steel, electricity, or coffee.[73] Large trading companies have their regional or global headquarters in the canton, such as Bunge, Cargill, Vitol, Gunvor, BNP Paribas, or Mercuria Energy Group, in addition to being home to the world's second largest shipping company, Mediterranean Shipping Company. Commodity trading is sustained by a strong trade finance sector, with large banks such as BCGE, BCP, BNP Paribas, BCV, Crédit Agricole, Credit Suisse, ING, Société Générale, and UBS, all having their headquarters in the area for this business. Wealth management is dominated by private banks, particularly Pictet, Lombard Odier, Edmond de Rothschild Group, Union Bancaire Privée, Mirabaud Group, Dukascopy Bank, Bordier & Cie, Banque SYZ, or REYL & Cie. In addition, the canton is home to the largest concentration of foreign-owned banks in Switzerland, such as HSBC Private Bank, JPMorgan Chase, or Arab Bank. Behind the financial sector, the next largest major economic sector is watchmaking, dominated by luxury firms Rolex, Richemont, Patek Philippe, Piaget, Roger Dubuis, and others, whose factories are concentrated in the Les Acacias neighbourhood, as well as the neighbouring municipalities of Plan-les-Ouates, Satigny, and Meyrin. Trade finance, wealth management, and watchmaking, approximately contribute two thirds of the corporate tax paid in the canton[74] Other large multinationals are also headquartered in the city and canton, such as Firmenich (in Satigny), and Givaudan (in Vernier), the world's two largest manufacturers of flavours, fragrances and active cosmetic ingredients; SGS, the world's largest inspection, verification, testing and certification services company; Temenos, a large banking software provider; or the local headquarters for Procter & Gamble, Japan Tobacco International, or L'Oréal (in Vernier). Although they do not directly contribute to the local economy, the city of Geneva is also host to the world's largest concentration of international organisations and UN agencies, such as the Red Cross, the World Health Organization, the World Trade Organization, the International Telecommunication Union, the World Intellectual Property Organization, the World Meteorological Organization, and the International Labour Organization, as well as the European headquarters of the United Nations. Its international mindedness, well-connected airport, and centrality in the continent, also make Geneva a good destination for congresses and trade fairs, of which the largest is the Geneva Motor Show held in Palexpo. Agriculture is commonplace in the hinterlands of Geneva, particularly wheat and wine. Despite its relatively small size, the canton produces around 10% of the Swiss wine and has the highest vineyard density in the country.[75] The largest strains grown in Geneva are gamay, chasselas, pinot noir, gamaret, and chardonnay. As of  2019[update], Geneva had an unemployment rate of 3.9%.[76] As of 2008[update], there were five[clarification needed] people employed in the primary economic sector and about three[clarification needed] businesses involved in this sector. 9,783 people were employed in the secondary sector and there were 1,200 businesses in this sector. 134,429 people were employed in the tertiary sector, with 12,489 businesses in this sector.[49] There were 91,880 residents of the municipality who were employed in some capacity, with women making up 47.7% of the workforce. In 2008[update], the total number of full-time equivalent jobs was 124,185. The number of jobs in the primary sector was four, all of which were in agriculture. The number of jobs in the secondary sector was 9,363 of which 4,863 or (51.9%) were in manufacturing and 4,451 (47.5%) were in construction. The number of jobs in the tertiary sector was 114,818. In the tertiary sector; 16,573 or 14.4% were in wholesale or retail sales or the repair of motor vehicles, 3,474 or 3.0% were in the movement and storage of goods, 9,484 or 8.3% were in a hotel or restaurant, 4,544 or 4.0% were in the information industry, 20,982 or 18.3% were the insurance or financial industry, 12,177 or 10.6% were technical professionals or scientists, 10,007 or 8.7% were in education and 15,029 or 13.1% were in health care.[77] In 2000[update], there were 95,190 workers who commuted into the municipality and 25,920 workers who commuted away. The municipality is a net importer of workers, with about 3.7 workers entering the municipality for every one leaving. About 13.8% of the workforce coming into Geneva are coming from outside Switzerland, while 0.4% of the locals commute out of Switzerland for work.[78] Of the working population, 38.2% used public transportation to get to work, and 30.6% used a private car.[49] Sport[edit] Ice hockey is the most popular sport in Geneva.[79] Geneva is home to Genève-Servette HC, which plays in the National League. They play their home games in the 7,135-seat Patinoire des Vernets. In 2008 and 2010 the team made it to the league finals but lost to the ZSC Lions and SC Bern respectively.[80] The team is by far the most popular one in both the city and the canton of Geneva, drawing three times more spectators than the football team in 2017.[81][82] The town is home to Servette FC, a football club founded in 1890 and named after a borough on the right bank of the Rhône. The home of Servette FC is the 30,000-seat Stade de Genève. Servette FC plays in the Raiffeisen Super League. Urania Genève Sport also play in the city. Geneva is home to the basketball team Lions de Genève, 2013 and 2015 champions of the Swiss Basketball League. The team plays its home games in the Pavilion des Sports. Geneva Jets Australian Football Club have been playing Australian Football in the AFL Switzerland league since 2019. Infrastructure[edit] Transportation[edit] This section needs to be updated.

It is connected by Geneva Airport railway station (French: Gare de Genève-Aéroport) to both the Swiss Federal Railways network and the French SNCF network, including links to Paris, Lyon, Marseille and Montpellier by TGV. Geneva is connected to the motorway systems of both Switzerland (A1 motorway) and France. Public transport by bus, trolleybus or tram is provided by Transports Publics Genevois. In addition to an extensive coverage of the city centre, the network extends to most of the municipalities of the Canton, with a few lines reaching into France. Public transport by boat is provided by the Mouettes Genevoises, which link the two banks of the lake within the city, and by the Compagnie Générale de Navigation sur le lac Léman which serves more distant destinations such as Nyon, Yvoire, Thonon, Évian, Lausanne and Montreux using both modern diesel vessels and vintage paddle steamers. Geneva Sécheron railway station Trains operated by Swiss Federal Railways connect the airport to the main station of Cornavin in six minutes. Regional train services are being developed towards Coppet and Bellegarde. At the city limits two new railway stations have been opened since 2002: Genève-Sécheron (close to the UN and the Botanical Gardens) and Lancy-Pont-Rouge. In 2011 work started on the CEVA rail (Cornavin – Eaux-Vives – Annemasse) project, first planned in 1884, which will connect Cornavin with the Cantonal hospital, Eaux-Vives railway station and Annemasse, in France. The link between the main railway station and the classification yard of La Praille already exists; from there, the line runs mostly underground to the Hospital and Eaux-Vives, where it links to the existing line to France. The line fully opened in December 2019, as part of the Léman Express regional rail network. TOSA Bus at PALEXPO Flash bus stops In May 2013, the demonstrator electric bus system[83] with a capacity of 133 passengers commenced between Geneva Airport and Palexpo. The project aims to introduce a new system of mass transport with electric ""flash"" recharging of the buses at selected stops while passengers are disembarking and embarking.[84] Taxis in Geneva can be difficult to find, and may need to be booked in advance, especially in the early morning or at peak hours. Taxis can refuse to take babies and children because of seating legislation.[85] An ambitious project to close 200 streets in the centre of Geneva to cars was approved by the Geneva cantonal authorities in 2010 and was planned to be implemented over a span of four years (2010–2014), though as of 2018[update], work on the project has yet to be started.[86] Utilities[edit] Water, natural gas and electricity are provided to the municipalities of the Canton of Geneva by the state-owned Services Industriels de Genève, known as SIG. Most of the drinking water (80%) is extracted from the lake; the remaining 20% is provided by groundwater, originally formed by infiltration from the Arve. 30% of the Canton's electricity needs is locally produced, mainly by three hydroelectric dams on the Rhône (Seujet, Verbois and Chancy-Pougny). In addition, 13% of the electricity produced in the Canton is from the burning of waste at the waste incineration facility of Les Cheneviers. The remaining needs (57%) are covered by imports from other cantons in Switzerland or other European countries; SIG buys only electricity produced by renewable methods, and in particular does not use electricity produced using nuclear reactors or fossil fuels. Natural gas is available in the City of Geneva, as well as in about two-thirds of the municipalities of the canton, and is imported from Western Europe by the Swiss company Gaznat. SIG also provides telecommunication facilities to carriers, service providers and large enterprises. From 2003 to 2005, ""Voisin, voisine"" a fibre to the Home pilot project with a triple play offering was launched to test the end-user market in the Charmilles district. International organisations[edit] See also: List of international organizations based in Geneva The World Intellectual Property Organization. The assembly hall of the Palace of Nations. Geneva is the European headquarters of the United Nations, in the Palace of Nations building, which was also the headquarters of the former League of Nations. Several agencies are headquartered at Geneva, including the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the World Health Organization, the International Labour Organization, International Telecommunication Union, the International Baccalaureate Organization and the World Intellectual Property Organization. Apart from the UN agencies, Geneva hosts many inter-governmental organizations, such as the World Trade Organization, the South Centre, the World Meteorological Organization, the World Economic Forum, the International Organization for Migration, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the International Committee of the Red Cross. The Maison de la Paix building hosts the three Geneva centres supported by the Swiss Confederation: the International Centre for Humanitarian Demining, the Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces and the Geneva Centre for Security Policy, as well as other organisations active in the field of peace, international affairs and sustainable development.[87] Organizations on the European level include the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research) which is the world's largest particle physics laboratory. The Geneva Environment Network (GEN) publishes the Geneva Green Guide,[88] an extensive listing of Geneva-based global organisations working on environment protection and sustainable development. A website,[89] jointly run by the Swiss Government, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, the United Nations Environment Programme and the International Union for Conservation of Nature, includes accounts of how NGOs, business, government and the UN cooperate. By doing so, it attempts to explain why Geneva has been picked by so many NGOs and UN bodies as their headquarters' location. The World Organization of the Scout Movement and the World Scout Bureau Central Office are headquartered in Geneva.

La lutte pour les droits des personnes LGBTQ+ (lesbienne, gay, bi, trans, queer,...) est intimement liée à la lutte contre le sexisme, puisqu'elles visent toutes les deux à renverser le schéma binaire classique de l’homme exerçant seul le pouvoir et l'autorité politique, économique, religieuse... au détriment des femmes. Association reconnue d’intérêt général : votre don déductible des impôts à 66% Faire un don Je m'engage dans un groupe ou au sein de la coordination nationale Je m'engage Formulaire de recherche Rechercher Actualités Ça bouge dans les formations d'ingénieur⋅e ! Ce printemps a été marqué par la publication de plusieurs rapports éclairant sous différentes facettes l’enseignement de la transition écologique. Quelles actions pour prévenir et prendre en charge les violences sexistes et sexuelles ? Que ce soit lors de nos événements, ou dans les activités militantes, nous ne sommes pas immunisé·es contre l’existence de violences sexistes et sexuelles. Depuis 2020, ISF a lancé un travail portant sur la prévention des violences sexistes et sexuelles (PVSS), dans un contexte où la parole se délie dans l’enseignement supérieur. Puis-je être misandre ? Revenu à plusieurs reprises lors de l’arpentage du dernier ouvrage de Pauline Harmange lors des dernières RESIC, le terme de misandrie est souvent placé en opposition à la misogynie. Analysée dans le contexte actuel, cette comparaison n’est pas pertinente. Migrations environnementales : découvrir le collectif ""des ponts pas des murs"" Le CRID est un collectif qui rassemble une cinquantaine d’organisations de solidarité internationale, dont ISF est membre. Né dans les années 1970, dans une perspective altermondialiste, il porte aujourd’hui les enjeux de solidarité internationale auprès des mouvements sociaux en France et anime des espaces collectifs. ÉCOLE HECTAR… Une formation sans enseignant·es et une agriculture sans paysan·nes L'école d'agriculture ""Hectar"" de Xavier Niel et d’Audrey Bourolleau, projet annoncé au mois de février, va ouvrir ses portes dès la rentrée de septembre dans les Yvelines. Selon ses financeurs « Hectar est le plus grand campus agricole du monde, un écosystème constitué d’une ferme en agriculture régénératrice, un centre de formation et un lieu d’innovation accueillant des start-up ». Cette école gratuite a pour objectifs de « redonner envie et aussi attirer de nouveaux profils dans le secteur agricole ». « Nous projetons à terme d’accompagner 2000 personnes par an, dont 1000 personnes formées à un métier et 1000 autres dans le cadre de la sensibilisation », « notamment des jeunes des quartiers prioritaires. ». … une belle plaquette publicitaire qui aura fait le tour des réseaux sociaux mais qui cache un projet beaucoup moins vertueux qu’il n’en a l’air. Contre le projet extractiviste du Pacte Vert Européen ISF dénonce, avec plus de 180 organisations de la société civile européenne et internationale, les plans de l'UE sur les matières premières dans le Pacte Vert pour l’Europe. Partir des Low-tech pour aller vers une nouvelle éthique de l'ingénierie ? Que ce soit à travers « Low-tech With Refugees », « Nomades des mers » et le « Low-tech Lab » ou « L’Atelier Paysan », le concept , les exemples et la démarche Low-tech rencontrent un certain succès auprès des ingénieur⋅es et étudiant⋅es ingénieur⋅es engagé⋅es pour le climat ou la solidarité. Celles-ci sont un exemple indéniable de technologie vertueuse, malheureusement leur généralisation semble difficile. Ce texte propose de rechercher la définition d'un ""état d'esprit Low-tech"", qui pourrait constituer la définition d'une certaine éthique de l'ingénierie... ""Enseigner la transition écologique dans le supérieur"" : un rapport à ne pas négliger Le 29 mars, le groupe de travail ""Enseigner la transition écologique dans le supérieur"" a rendu son rapport. Missionné par Frédérique Vidal et présidé par Jean Jouzel, ce groupe de travail n'a sorti ses recommandations qu'après huit mois d'attente. La mission de ce groupe de travail a été prolongée par le ministère. Ingénieurs Sans Frontières soutient l'UNEF Ingénieurs Sans Frontières France témoigne son soutien à l'UNEF (Union Nationale des Etudiants de France), attaqué par de nombreuses personnalités politiques pour sa pratique de réunions en non-mixité choisie, un outil pourtant déterminant dans la libération de la parole des personnes victimes de discriminations racistes, sexistes et lgbtphobes et l'organisation de leurs luttes.

Our key programming includes the Caux Scholars Program (Switzerland and Asia Plateau), Community Trustbuilding Fellowship, Narrative Change Collaborative and Faith Rooted Revolution. We also provide consultant services in strategic planning, facilitation and dialogue.Over the course of nearly 100 years, IofC has created innovative methods, tools and strategies in trustbuilding that develop greater cohesion, understanding, representation and expression between communities of difference across the world. Although varied and locally situated, communities are also marked by matrixes of power that are historically and systematically unequal, hierarchal, and violent. Practices are designed by concepts of supremacy and inferiority (race, gender, religion, politics, language, and education) so that only a few are accorded access to full human rights, resources and opportunities to the exclusion of many others.  Inspired and informed by our expert network, Initiatives of Change bridges gaps in understanding, interpretation, translation and representation between those of competing identities and interests. IofC facilitates and forges deep partnerships between community leaders, activists and influencers, technical organizations, government agencies, educational institutions, nonprofits, the business sector and individuals. As an organizational network, we practice traditioned innovation through4 point process of transformation: We provide responsive capacity techniques for global leaders to take on robust community leadership interventions, build spaces for truth-telling about our histories, and ongoing mechanisms for inclusive dialogue. IofC is an accompanying presence to our alumni, partners and larger communities, offering tools of solidarity, fellowship, compassion and compassion, and wellness to help strategize effectively for our futures. By equipping leaders at multiple scales, we create and sustain processes of personal and community change beyond conflict.Traditioned InnovationA Practice of Present Presence Through traditioned innovation, Initiatives of Change USA is consistently moving forward, learning and growing but also carrying the valuable lessons and legacies of our history with us. Traditioned innovation is a practice of present presence that is hybrid, multi-focal, and speaks to our current moment as a way of bridging our past with an infinite future.We are amplifying our capacity to walk with community partners, government leaders, educational and cultural institutions, faith based centers, and creative entrepreneurs to better sustain the good work they are accomplishing. Through this work we recognize that individual and collective truth-telling and reconciliation processes are necessary. We are doing the inner work to reflect honestly, ask deep questions, stir in discomforts, admit the challenges, and move forward with the outer work and a plan for ongoing growth, connection and building with others.As a nonprofit organization, this approach builds accountability internally so that we can work more sincerely with communities in honest ways where communication is based on mutuality, reciprocity, exchange and learning - essential practice for cross-cultural understandings across social differences and divides. 4 Point Process Tactile Communications Our History Who We Are Who We Are Who We Are Who We Are DONATEWORK WITH USCONTACT US2201 West Broad StreetSuite 200Richmond, VA 23220+1 804 358-1764info.us@iofc.orgFollow us!",Initiatives of Change International

Initiatives of Change has spiritual roots but no religious affiliation, and invites ""those with a faith...both to explore the roots of their own tradition, and to discover and respect the beliefs of others.""[2] The name ""Initiatives of Change"" was adopted in 2001, expressing the emphasis of the organization in effecting social change beginning with personal change. Programs[edit] Initiatives of Change has programs in over 60 countries. In the United States, Hope in the Cities promotes ""honest conversations"" on race, reconciliation and responsibility. Their approach was integrated in the One America Dialogue Guide published by the White House at the initiative of U.S. President Bill Clinton in 1998.[3] The programme Trust and Integrity in the Global Economy hold events in a number of Western countries, focusing on overcoming corruption and building cooperation.[4] In Switzerland, the Caux Forum for Human Security, brings together people working for peace and human security.[5][6] In India, the IC Centre for Governance works with development experts, policy makers, social activists and others to strengthen the role of citizens in governance.

Its first president was Cornelio Sommaruga, formerly President of the International Committee of the Red Cross.

Conference centres[edit] Mountain House, the Initiatives of Change conference centre Initiatives of Change has centres in numerous countries. The largest conference centres are Mountain House, formerly the Caux Palace Hotel in Caux, near Montreux, and Asia Plateau, in Panchgani in India. Mountain House was a derelict hotel in 1946, when it was bought by 100 Swiss families, and restored as a place where the warring nations of Europe could meet. In the following years thousands came there, including German Chancellor Adenauer and French Foreign Minister Robert Schuman.[8] At Caux many found reconciliation with former enemies, notably the French socialist leader Irène Laure who had been active in the French Resistance and who, thereafter, devoted herself to building Franco-German understanding. Edward Luttwak described the work of Caux as an ""important contribution to one of the greatest achievements in the entire record of modern statecraft: the astonishingly rapid Franco-German reconciliation after 1945.""[9] In the following decades Caux welcomed people from African and Asian countries moving towards independence from colonial rule. In 1956, soon after Morocco became independent, King Mohammed V of Morocco sent a message to Frank Buchman: ""I thank you for all you have done for Morocco in the course of these last testing years.""[10] In 1960 Archbishop Makarios and Dr Kucuk, President and Vice-President of Cyprus, jointly sent the first flag of independent Cyprus to Caux in recognition of the center's help.[11] More recently, groups of opposing factions in the Great Lakes area of Africa, Sierra Leone and other areas of conflict, have met there. Also prominent in the center's programs have been meetings between management and unions. The Caux Round Table was launched there in 1986, and continues to meet there. It developed a program of Principles for Business[12] which are now used widely in business and industry. Each summer the centre holds a series of conferences dealing with specific subjects, attended by both teenagers and adults. In 2008 the first Caux Forum for Human Security, initiated by Mohamed Sahnoun, brought together 300 people working for peace and human security.[13] and this has developed into an annual conference on 'Just Governance for Human Security'. 'Land, Lives, Peace' brings together people from many countries working to restore degraded land to productive use. 'Children as Actors for Transforming Society' deals with children's rights and children's participation[14] in partnership with a coalition of civil society organisation such as the Child-to-Child Trust and Learning for Well-being or the International Janusz Korczak Association. Asia Plateau in India holds conferences throughout most of the year, dealing with ethical governance, cooperation for development and conflict resolution. These bring together workers and managers from many industries, NGO leaders, public servants, and others. It also holds international conferences such as 'Making democracy real' and 'Dialogue on Just Governance', which bring together participants from over 40 countries.

Our grassroots approach encourages local ownership and focuses on accompanying, strengthening, and empowering individuals to be the change they want to see in the world. Our Aims Our Vision: a just, peaceful and sustainable world to which everyone, responding to the call of conscience, makes their unique contribution. Our Mission: to inspire, equip and connect people to address world needs, starting with themselves. There are 36 national teams and international programmes that comprise IofC’s voluntary association membership. Each operates autonomously, but focuses their attention in one or more of the following areas: Trustbuilding: Peace and social cohesion through trust and reconciliation. Ethical Leadership: Leadership based on integrity, compassion and selfless service. Sustainable Living: Economic justice and environmental sustainability. IofC’s teams and programmes aim to be inclusive of all people and perspectives; we do not discriminate based on sex, age, race, ethnicity, nationality, disability, sexual orientation, religion, culture, or individual political opinions. Everyone, everywhere, has a part to play and a story to tell. What We Do People are at the centre of our approach, linking global and personal change. Our work focuses on the human dynamic of lasting change. We uphold a self-reflective approach and values-based living as our primary tools in this effort. We encourage people to: Reflect We believe an honest look at one’s own motives and behaviour is often the start of personal transformation. Across the world's many cultures you will find values that serve to guide the individual and the community. Of the many, IofC singles out four values as our foundation for self-reflection: Honesty Unselfishness Love Purity Listen Honest conversation, undertaken in an open spirit, builds bridges of trust and community between people of similar, different, and even antagonistic, backgrounds. These enable healing, partnership and common action. Act Our people and programmes seek to strengthen the foundations of society and to bring healing where there is conflict. Take a look at our programmes or sign up for one of our events to find your opportunity for action.

This rapid development of China's new energy automotive industry is one result of the pro-EV policies made at the national and local levels. Because China is now transitioning from pilot- and policy-directed development and a more meaningful engagement with industry, challenges to NEV commercialization consist of mainly local deployment and market protectionism. This study proposed a new index for assessing relative market openness for competitive NEV development: ""the NEV Market Openness Index"". The index was developed on the basis of conventional diversity combined with penetration indexes, both adopted from biological studies, with a particular focus on passenger NEVs, and based on data from 23 Cities and 20 provinces. China Passenger Vehicle Fuel Consumption Development Annual Report 2017 (December 2017) iCET has been involved in the drafting of China's fuel standards since its first iteration and has been tracking its development since. This report is the 7th iCET Annual Report evaluating China's CAFC standard implementation status with recommendations for policy. This year the report, although covering various aspects of China's corporate FC development, places considerable focus on the joint management mechanism of China's existing CAFC standard and the newly introduced NEV credits system. The highlights of this year's report are grouped around three themes: (I) fuel efficiency and the CAFC standard regime, (II) NEV super-credits (flexibility mechanism) and CAFC performance, and, (III) the newly introduced NEV credits system and the CAFC standard regime. Real-World Fuel Consumption Data Comparative Analysis-A case study based on two different consumer mobile apps in Beijing city There are increased interests in new data sources for evaluating the effectiveness policies that guide the development of the transportation sector, especially after the emergence of several notable emission scandals. However, few studies analyze these new data sources. Their applicability and usefulness are rarely compared and not well understood. This study attempts to fill this gap by drawing comparisons between two new data sources useful for assessing the actual fuel consumption (FC) of passenger cars: semi-manual calculation of FC through a dedicated app (BearOil, or Xiaoxiong) and automated FC (and other data points) collection by an On-Board Diagnostics (OBD) app (ZhiJiaXing). The study compares data features, statistical robustness and analysis results of the two datasets in a Beijing case study.

Our partnership with Feedback Labs and Guidestar by Candid, and other partners including Fund for Shared Insight, GlobalGiving, and Keystone Accountability, enables us to launch the first version of this beacon with Constituent Feedback information collected on Candid's site.Feedback practices have been shown to support better Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion outcomes, an essential area of assessment that we intend to further expand and develop in the future. Feedback Labs has documented several studies which indicate that beyond achieving organizational goals, nonprofits that are attentive and responsive to concerns and ideas raised by beneficiaries establish stronger relationships with the people they serve, promote greater equity, and empower constituents in ways that can help to ensure better long-term outcomes.

Floating market, Bangkok. Room II Not only does the ocean regulate the climate, it is also crucial to our food supply, health, economy, and future. Its extensive potential, still rather unexplored, offers numerous solutions to climate challenges. This workshop will highlight ways to promote sustainable management of human activities both at sea and in coastal areas through eco-innovations that are adapted to the diversity of actors, the knowledge base of populations, and varying cultures. Representatives from the private sector will present maritime innovations, holding potential solutions to adapt and mitigate climate change. NGOs and institutions specialized in scientific mediation will outline initiatives fostering collaboration between citizens and scientists. These include: innovative citizen scientific efforts aimed at gaining a greater understanding of our ocean’s biodiversity and bioresources, strategies used for placing the ocean at the heart of our daily concerns, and initiatives encouraging individuals and communities to take positive actions.Speakers Sylvain PiochResearch ScientistEcology of Arthropods and Anthropogenic ActivitiesUniversité Paul Valéry-Montpellier IIIFrance Raphaëla le GouvelloNavigatorFrance Christine Valentin Liaison DirectorWorld Ocean Council France Hélène ValadeSuez Environnement, C3D Julian StoneProject CoordinatorInnovations BleuesFranceYvan GribovalFounder and PresidentSailing OneFrance Claude Midi EngieFrance Nicolas ImbertGreen Cross Coordinators: Catherine ChabaudFounder and PresidentInnovations Bleues Colomban de VargasResearcher, CNRSStation Biologique de Roscoff Philippe ValletteGeneral ManagerNausicaa General InformationAbout usGeneral ConferenceExecutive BoardSecretariatField OfficesCommunitiesEventsJoin usPopular topicsWorld HeritageWaterClimate ChangePost-CrisisYouthResourcesConventions & RecommendationsDocumentsStatisticsBookshopMediaName and LogoHuman rights violationTerms of useContact usSitemap© UNESCO 2017",Innovations Bleues

Through the testimonials of inhabitants of the Inuit settlement of Ittoqqortoormiit, the team is exploring how we can better adapt to the climate.

To bring the climate urgency to life, create more empathy and appeal to a wider audience, he created Greenlandia in 2015. This project combines scientific expeditions, pedagogy and documentaries to follow in the footsteps of French polar explorer Commander Charcot in Inuit territory. The team has reached out to a community still connected to nature to survive, so as to learn from their experience of extreme weather conditions and give them a platform to share their stories. Bearing witness to way of life attuned to nature Planned to last from September 2020-2025, this project will comprise several scientific marine and land expeditions. The aim? Understand, raise awareness and document the impact of climate and climate change in one of the exposed areas in the world, in order to explore possible solutions. Greenlandia teamed up with a European Scientific Research Consortium to deepen their understanding of the relationship between this community and the natural world. To share their findings, they have set up an educative programme between France and Greenland based on pedagogical tools inspired by the expeditions and young people living in Ittoqqortoormiit. Documentaries and artistic initiatives will help raise awareness and document a unique way of life.

Its objective is to develop and share key knowledge and tools for analysing and shedding light on the strategic issues of sustainable development from a global perspective. Given the rising stakes of the issues posed by climate change and biodiversity loss, IDDRI provides stakeholders with input for their reflection on global governance, and also participates in work on reframing development pathways. A special effort has been made to develop a partnership network with emerging countries to better understand and share various perspectives on sustainable development issues and governance. For more effective action, IDDRI operates with a network of partners from the private sector, academia, civil society and the public sector, not only in France and Europe but also internationally. As an independent institute, IDDRI mobilises resources and expertise to disseminate the most relevant scientific ideas and research ahead of negotiations and decision-making processes. It applies a cross-cutting approach to its work, which focuses on five threads: global governance, climate change, biodiversity, urban fabric, and agriculture. Follow Loading...

Its research focuses on global governance, North-South relations and international negotiations.IDDRI has three objectives: informing policy decisions; identifying emerging issues; and creating a platform for dialogue between stakeholders whose interests are often at odds - research organizations, public and private economic actors, unions and NGOs. To meet these objectives, IDDRI defines the challenges, gathers stakeholders - whatever their origin and discipline - and identifies new issues. It thus promotes a common understanding of concerns, while at the same time putting them into a global perspective.International conferences, conference-debates, workshops and regular seminars are some of IDDRI's core activities, and are often organized with foreign partners. The members of the team are also invited for interventions in events coordinated by other organizations.ReferencesWebsiteAction Guide v0.9Built on Django and Bootstrap at GitHub.",Institut du Développement Durable et des Relations Internationales

L’Institut est un organisme d’intermédiation dont l’objectif est de favoriser la coopération entre les acteurs publics, parapublics et privés engagés dans la démarche relevant de l’EFC et provenant de tous horizons: organisations, entreprises de toutes tailles, collectivités territoriales, consultants, chercheurs et toutes personnes intéressées par la transition écologique, économique et sociétale. Notre mission est de faire mieux connaître le modèle de l’EFC car il ne peut pas y avoir de transition sans transition économique et sans changement du travail. Pour y arriver, l’Institut s’appuie tout d’abord sur un réseau de Clubs Territoriaux. Deux nouveaux clubs viennent de rejoindre l’Institut : le club PREFICS en région Centre Val de Loire et le Club Terre d’EFC dans le bassin de vie d’Avignon-Arles-Nîmes. Deux autres sont en cours de création en Occitanie Ouest (Toulouse) et Grand-Est. Nous sommes également sollicité pour d’autres créations… Pour en savoir plus D’autre part, l’Institut anime 6 ateliers sur différents thèmes de recherche opérationnelle afin de fournir des outils et des méthodes pour mieux diffuser et mettre en œuvre des projets relevant de l’EFC.

De quoi parle-t-on ? © FOTOLIA L'économie de la fonctionnalité est un élément essentiel de la vision de l'ADEME sur la transition écologique, énergétique et sociale. Elle accompagne les mutations économiques de l'économie circulaire. L’économie de la fonctionnalité établit une nouvelle relation entre l’offre et la demande qui n’est plus uniquement basée sur la simple vente de biens ou de services. La contractualisation repose sur les effets utiles (bénéfices) et l’offre s’adapte aux besoins réels des personnes, des entreprises et des collectivités ainsi qu’aux enjeux relatifs au développement durable. Par exemple, on passe de la vente de chaudières et d’énergie à des solutions de confort thermique et d’efficacité énergétique, de la vente de compresseurs industriels à des solutions de fourniture d’air comprimé et d’efficacité énergétique, de la vente de produits alimentaires à des solutions de bien-vivre alimentaire et de préservation de la santé. Ce nouveau modèle économique constitue en cela un véritable changement de culture consistant à sortir de la logique transactionnelle immédiate entre un fournisseur de produits et son client pour passer à un contrat de confiance évolutif et sur le plus long terme, nécessitant une véritable relation personnalisée et de proximité avec le bénéficiaire. Ce modèle économique induit plus largement des transformations profondes dans les modes de production et de consommation : consommation sans propriété des biens, investissement stratégique dans les ressources immatérielles de l’entreprise (développement des compétences des salariés, management coopératif…), développement du réemploi et de la réparation des biens, revenus liés aux effets utiles, répartition équitable de la valeur entre les partenaires de l’offre, nouvelle gouvernance… Il constitue un nouveau référentiel pour le développement durable des territoires et conduit à la mise en place d'écosystèmes coopératifs territorialisés associant des entreprises, des collectivités et des associations citoyennes. Ces écosystèmes articulent la dynamique entrepreneuriale et le développement territorial. Voir la note « Développement durable des territoires : la voie de l'économie de la fonctionnalité et de la coopération » qui décrit la théorie de ce modèle, les différentes étapes de la démarche et les premières actions concrètes dans les territoires. L’ADEME agit en faveur de l’économie de la fonctionnalité L'économie de la fonctionnalité est, dans une vision prospective, un facteur clef de résilience économique, environnementale et sociale. L’ADEME a produit en 2017 avec le cabinet ATEMIS une vision prospective sur l’économie de la fonctionnalité à l’horizon 2050. L’étude explore les tendances lourdes et les signaux faibles menant à des scénarios contrastés, le cheminement possible vers la vision et les conditions de son déploiement. La prospective est complétée par l’analyse de premiers territoires et entreprises engagés dans l’économie de la fonctionnalité. L’ADEME accompagne les entreprises dans leurs trajectoires de changement vers l’économie de la fonctionnalité : opérations collectives pour la formation-action de dirigeants d’entreprises, projets individuels d’entreprises, séminaires de sensibilisation au nouveau modèle. L’ADEME soutient aussi la communauté de pensée et d’action qui se développe sur ce nouveau modèle économique : l’institut européen de l’économie de la fonctionnalité et de la coopération (IE-EFC), les clubs régionaux sur l’économie de la fonctionnalité. Ces partenaires animent les acteurs au niveau national et en régions, produisent des ressources et mènent des recherches appliquées. Plus d'information dans notre médiathèque : Panorama national et pistes d'action pour l’économie de la fonctionnalité Développement durable des territoires : la voie de l'économie de la fonctionnalité et de la coopération Programme COOP'TER © ADEME Lancé en 2020, Territoire de Services et de Coopérations (Coop'ter) est un programme de recherche-intervention pour le développement durable des territoires. Parce qu’un changement de modèle économique est nécessaire à la transition écologique et sociale, Coop'ter soutient le lancement de nouvelles dynamiques territoriales d’innovation, en se référant à l’Economie de la Fonctionnalité et de la Coopération. Coop'ter est basé sur une approche de « recherche-intervention» : le programme se donne le double objectif d’une conversion opérationnelle des pratiques économiques dans les territoires et d’une transformation des cadres conceptuels et théoriques. C’est dans un perpétuel aller-retour entre recherche et terrain que peut s’inscrire le changement.

Il apparaît de plus en plus nécessaire de créer des occasions de coopération (création de réseaux) entre territoires voir au niveau international. Fort de leur ancrage territorial, ces entreprises sont en même temps à la recherche de nouvelles coopérations avec des partenaires relevant d’autres territoires aussi bien au plan national qu’international. Nous pensons que le nouveau contexte crée un potentiel de coopération permettant aux entreprises de s’identifier, de se connaitre et de faire connaitre leur nouvelle dynamique.

Sommaire Science dedicated to life, humans, and the Earth Humankind and the planet are facing global changes that will create new challenges for research to address: limiting the effects of and adapting to climate change; increasing food security and nutrition security; transitioning to new agricultural systems; preserving natural resources; restoring biodiversity; and anticipating and managing risks. It will also be important to consider more regional issues like living conditions, farmers' salaries, the economic competitiveness of companies, land use, and universal access to healthy and varied diets. INRAE, the French National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food, and Environment was formed by the merger of INRA and IRSTEA on 1st January 2020 As the world's top institute for research on agriculture, food, and the environment*, INRAE will help address these concerns. It will use research, innovation, and support for public policies as tools to guide the emergence of sustainable agricultural and food production systems. The institute aims to carry out science dedicated to life, humans, and the Earth that uncovers solutions to our most pressing concerns. INRAE was formed by the merger of INRA, the French National Institute for Agricultural Research, and IRSTEA, the French National Research Institute of Science and Technology for the Environment and Agriculture. Both institutes were known for the quality of their research and their great expertise. Their union has generated a critical research mass and has pooled their major infrastructures (e.g., observatories, technical platforms, data repositories), including some that are one of a kind in Europe. As a result, INRAE is uniquely suited to perform valuable research on numerous topics, including water resources, regional agricultural strategies, the preservation and restoration of biodiversity, risk anticipation and management, and digital agriculture. For more information INRAE: a French institute with international goals (nouvelle fenêtre) INRAE is committed to exploring the frontiers of science and performing high-calibre research that is globally relevant. The institute makes major contributions to European research and participates in European research programmes (e.g., via research networks, H2020 research projects, Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions) and, as a result, is currently developing bilateral and trilateral partnerships. Our international collaborations focus on sharing laboratories or infrastructure, becoming integrated into research networks, and playing a role within international organisations. ""Our need for research has never been more urgent"": find out more *Based on the Web of Science (WOS) specialisation index score: INRAE's representation within the 10 following research domains/ INRAE's representation within all the WOS research domains at the international scale: Agriculture, Plant sciences, Veterinary sciences, Genetics & heredity, Food science & technology, Nutrition dietetics, Biotechnology & applied microbiology, Environmental sciences & ecology, Water resources, Microbiology. Research that serves society Our job is to produce and disseminate knowledge to help solve major societal challenges put this knowledge to work to foster innovation, provide expertise, and lend support to public policies which we accomplish thanks to an approach based on interdisciplinary foresight analysis of current challenges research at the frontiers of knowledge that encourages breakthroughs academic partnerships at regional, national, European, and international scales that are firmly tied to regional structures within the system of higher education and research expertise and support that inform public policies from the local to the international level partnerships with the many stakeholders in the field: farmers, private companies, NGOs, regional governments...each with a variety of perspectives and approaches open-source tools for promoting innovation that allow the free exchange of ideas, knowledge, and experience infrastructure that enhances the sharing of research and data discussions with the general public to explain, debate, and contribute In all of our work, we are committed to applying a code of ethical practices. For more information Collaborating with the whole of society (nouvelle fenêtre) Using its research and its ability to produce, analyse, and exploit knowledge from a broad range of discipline-specific and interdisciplinary work, INRAE seeks to achieve conceptual, technological, and social breakthroughs; inform public policies; and boost crucial agricultural, dietary, and environmental transitions. We cannot do this alone. As a result, we have affiliated ourselves with governmental structures for higher education, research, and innovation in France and in Europe; we are developing national and international partnerships with a wide range of public and private stakeholders in our fields of specialisation; and we are engaging in conversations with the general public and any other interested parties. A highly principled institute Our research subjects and practices directly tackle issues of concern for society, and our research results help inform the solutions we must adopt. In all our work, we rely on the guidance provided by our ethics committee and our code of conduct rooted in responsibility, impartiality, integrity, dignity, and probity. For certain research topics, INRAE has used this guidance to formally describe its institutional principles, positions, strategies, or opinions. More information Agriculture, food, and the environment: overlapping themes INRAE and its partners wish to tackle challenges that extend beyond national and industrial boundaries. We must therefore adopt transversal perspectives in our three key areas of study—agriculture, food, and the environment—if we wish to clearly account for their interactions. We need a systematic and interdisciplinary approach if we wish to develop sustainable solutions. With the overarching goal of promoting sustainable development, our work is centred on six major themes: Climate change and risks Agroecology Biodiversity Food, global health Bioeconomy Society and regional strategies For more information Structure and policies (nouvelle fenêtre) INRAE is deliberately organised in the form of a matrix, which helps the institute carry out its integrated multidisciplinary research for addressing society's greatest global challenges. To guide and accelerate the major transitions needed to enhance the sustainability of agricultural systems and food systems, INRAE carries out work at 18 research centres with strong regional ties that are clustered within 14 research divisions that have firmly established international partnerships. Metaprogrammes serve as links among the institute's research divisions, strengthening INRAE's interdisciplinary approach. The institute's work is also bolstered by its directorates dedicated to international affairs, open science, value creation, scientific expertise, and public policy support. Our various support departments (e.g., human resources, finance, purchasing) strive for maximum efficiency and espouse principles of social and environmental responsibility in alignment with our research objectives and our goal of serving society. The communications department works with all INRAE's staff to disseminate the institute's discoveries and engage in exchanges with stakeholders.

It has a reputation for producing scientific knowledge of international utility as well as findings that address issues of importance to the region.  Through its many relationships on both shores of the Mediterranean, the Centre has an important and strategic role to play. Its scientific positioning is truly original with respect to the major changes currently under way, such as climate change, market differentiation, sustainable resource management, genetics, health challenges and partnership and citizen research. See the centre French West Indies-French Guiana With its two sites in Guadeloupe and Guiana, the Centre well represents the agri-environmental issues specific to island and continental conditions in tropical regions. Its teams are organised in multidisciplinary consortia which can respond to the regional challenges of reinforcing food and environmental safety under the innovative concept of science and impact. The vulnerability of tropical agroecosystems means that the Centre offers an excellent laboratory to analyse how the climate is changing in response to current planetary shifts, and most particularly the conversion of conventional to ecologically intensive agriculture. Through its policy of welcoming doctoral students and postdoctoral scientists, the Centre is also closely involved in training in and through research for young people in the Caribbean and intertropical regions. See the centre Grand-Est - Colmar See the centre Grand-Est - Nancy Deployed in the Grand - Est region, our teams conduct their work around three main lines of research: the adaptation of forest, agricultural and urban ecosystems and soils to global changes, and the sustainable management of these territories. We thus contribute to the ecological transition, producing plant and microorganism-based materials and biomolecules. See the centre Hauts-de-France The teams in the Hauts-de-France centre conduct their work around two main research axes, the multi-performance of field crop systems for a sustainable bioeconomy, and the hygiene of agrifood processes.

It was founded in 1946 and is a Public Scientific and Technical Research Establishment under the joint authority of the Ministries of Research and Agriculture. From 1 January 2020 the INRA merged with the IRSTEA (Institut national de recherche en sciences et technologies pour l'environnement et l'agriculture) to create the INRAE (Institut national de recherche pour l'agriculture, l'alimentation et l'environnement).[3] INRA led projects of targeted research for a sustainable agriculture, a safeguarded environment and a healthy and high quality food. Based on the number of publications in agricultural sciences/crops and animal sciences, INRA was the first institute for agricultural research in Europe, and the second in the world.[2] It belonged to the top 1% most cited research institutes.[2] Contents 1 Missions 2 Staff and Organization 3 Centers and Partnerships 4 Research on wine and grapes 5 See also 6 References 7 External links Missions[edit] INRA main tasks were: to gather and disseminate knowledge; to build know-how and innovation for the society; to provide expertise to public institutions and private companies; to participate in science-society debates; to train in research. Staff and Organization[edit] INRA was a research institute with 1,840 researchers, 1,756 research engineers and 4,694 lab workers/field workers/administrative staff. In addition, 510 PhD students were trained, and 2,552 interns were employed every year.[2] INRA was composed of 13 scientific departments: Environment and Agronomy Biology and crop breeding Plant health and environment Ecology of forests, meadows and aquatic environments Animal genetics Animal physiology and animal production systems Animal health Characterization and processing of agricultural products Microbiology and food processing Human nutrition Sciences for action and development Social sciences, agriculture and food, territories and environment Applied mathematics and computer sciences Moreover, INRA provided tools and support to the scientific community: databases, environmental research observatories, genetic resources centers, experimental platforms, etc. Centers and Partnerships[edit] In 2014, INRA had 17 regional centres in France, including in the French overseas territories.

With a staff of 11,500 people, an annual budget of more than 1 billion euros, and an unparalleled wealth of expertise, INRAE embodies a different approach to collective action. We wish to harness the momentum from the institute's creation to make broad strides towards sustainable development. To this end, we will use first-rate human resource strategies. Human Resources Excellence in Research Award from the European CommissionINRAE received the European Commission's Human Resources (HR) Excellence in Research Award because of its high-quality recruitment, hiring, and training practices as well as its work to promote healthy psychological and social working conditions. The institute remains committed to applying this HR approach to create a favourable work environment for all its staff. 2,000 PhD students, 40% from foreign countries AFNOR Equality and Diversity CertificationINRAE has a gender equality policy that promotes the representation of women in all research areas and at all levels of responsibility. Its diversity policy ensures a level playing field for everyone when it comes to hiring decisions and career advancement. Notably, INRAE is committed to the greater inclusion of people with disabilities. INRAE's policy reflects the belief that a diverse and multicultural workforce is a valuable resource. INRAE should receive both types of certification by early 2020. We strongly feel that promoting a healthy work-life balance is important to fostering positive working conditions. INRAE provides competitive employee benefits to staff at all levels. These benefits include flexibility in defining one's work shift and location, the option to telecommute, the option to work part time, and structural support during life transitions.

Grenoble (/ɡrəˈnoʊbəl/ grə-NOH-bəl,[3] French: [ɡʁənɔbl] (listen); Arpitan: Grenoblo, Grainóvol, Occitan: Graçanòbol, Grasanòbol) is the prefecture and largest city of the Isère department in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region of Southeastern France.[4] It is located within the Dauphiné historical province and lies where the river Drac joins the Isère at the foot of the French Alps. The residents of the city are called ""Grenoblois"". The population of the commune of Grenoble was 158,180 at the 2016 census, while the population of the Grenoble metropolitan area (French: aire urbaine de Grenoble or ""agglomération grenobloise"") was 687,985 which makes it the largest metropolis in the Alps, ahead of Innsbruck and Bolzano. A significant European scientific centre,[5][6] the city advertises itself as the ""Capital of the Alps"", due to its size and its proximity to the mountains. The many suburb communes that make up the rest of the metropolitan area include four with populations exceeding 20,000: Saint-Martin-d'Hères, Échirolles, Fontaine and Voiron.[7][8] Grenoble's history goes back over 2,000 years, to a time when it was a village of the Allobroges Gallic tribe. It became the capital of the Dauphiné in the 11th century.[9] This status, consolidated by the annexation to France, allowed it to develop its economy. Grenoble then became a parliamentary and military city, close to the border with Savoy. Industrial development increased the prominence of Grenoble through several periods of economic expansion over the last three centuries. This started with a booming glove industry in the 18th and 19th centuries, continued with the development of a strong hydropower industry in the late 19th to early 20th centuries and ended with a post-World War II economic boom symbolized by the holding of the X Olympic Winter Games in 1968. The city has grown to be one of Europe's most important research, technology and innovation centres, with one in five inhabitants working directly in these fields.[5][6][10] Grenoble is classified as a global city with the ranking of ""sufficiency"" by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. The city will hold the title of European Green Capital in 2022.[11] Contents 1 History 1.1 Antiquity 1.2 Middle Ages 1.3 Renaissance 1.4 From Louis XIV to the French Revolution 1.5 19th century 1.6 20th century 1.6.1 World War II 1.6.2 Post-war 2 Geography 2.1 Climate 3 Population 4 Urbanism and architecture 5 Main sights 5.1 La Bastille 5.2 Palace of the Parliament of Dauphiné 5.3 Museum of Grenoble 5.4 Archaeological museums 6 Education and science 6.1 Secondary level 6.2 Higher education 6.2.1 Science and engineering 6.3 Knowledge and innovation community 7 Security and Crime 8 Economy 8.1 Companies 8.2 Media 9 Sport 10 Transport 11 Culture 12 People from Grenoble 13 International relations 13.1 Twin towns and sister cities 14 Gallery 15 See also 16 References 17 Bibliography 18 External links History[edit] See also: Timeline of Grenoble For the ecclesiastical history, see Roman Catholic Diocese of Grenoble-Vienne. Antiquity[edit] Remnants of the Roman walls The first references to what is now Grenoble date back to 43 BC. Cularo was at that time a Gallic village of the Allobroges tribe, near a bridge across the Isère. Three centuries later and with insecurity rising in the late Roman empire, a strong wall was built around the small town in 286 AD.[12] The Emperor Gratian visited Cularo and, touched by the people's welcome, made the village a Roman city.[13] In honour of this, Cularo was renamed Gratianopolis (""city of Gratian"") in 381 (leading to Graignovol[14] during the Middle Age and then Grenoble). Christianity spread to the region during the 4th century, and the diocese of Grenoble was founded in 377 AD. From that time on, the bishops exercised significant political power over the city. Until the French Revolution, they styled themselves the ""bishops and princes of Grenoble"".[15] Middle Ages[edit] After the collapse of the Roman Empire, the city was part of the first Burgundian kingdom in the 5th century and the later Kingdom of Burgundy until 1032, when it was integrated into the Holy Roman Empire. Burgundian rule was interrupted between 942 and 970 due to Arab rule based in Fraxinet. Grenoble grew significantly in the 11th century when the Counts of Albon chose the city as the capital of their territories. At the time, their possessions were a patchwork of several territories sprawled across the region.[16] The central position of Grenoble allowed the Counts to strengthen their authority. When they later adopted the title of ""Dauphins"", Grenoble became the capital of the State of Dauphiné. Despite their status, the Counts had to share authority over the city with the Bishop of Grenoble. One of the most famous of those was Saint Hugh. Under his rule, the city's bridge was rebuilt, and a regular and leper hospital were built.[17] Coat of arms of the Dauphiné after becoming a province of France The inhabitants of Grenoble took advantage of the conflicts between the Counts and the bishops and obtained the recognition of a Charter of Customs that guaranteed their rights.[18] That charter was confirmed by Kings Louis XI in 1447 and Francis I in 1541. In 1336 the last Dauphin Humbert II founded a court of justice, the Conseil delphinal [fr], which settled at Grenoble in 1340. He also established the University of Grenoble in 1339. Without an heir, Humbert sold his state to France in 1349, on the condition that the heir to the French crown used the title of Dauphin. The first one, the future Charles V, spent nine months in Grenoble. The city remained the capital of the Dauphiné,[9] henceforth a province of France, and the Estates of Dauphiné were created. The only Dauphin who really governed his province was the future Louis XI, whose ""reign"" lasted from 1447 to 1456. It was only under his rule that Dauphiné properly joined the Kingdom of France. The Old Conseil Delphinal became a Parlement (the third in France after the Parliaments of Paris and Toulouse), strengthening the status of Grenoble as a Provincial capital. He also ordered the construction of the Palais du Parlement (finished under Francis I) and ensured that the Bishop pledged allegiance, thus forging the political union of the city.[19] At that time, Grenoble was a crossroads between Vienne, Geneva, Italy, and Savoy. It was the industrial centre of the Dauphiné and the biggest city of the province, but nonetheless a rather small one. Renaissance[edit] François de Bonne, duc de Lesdiguières Owing to Grenoble's geographical situation, French troops were garrisoned in the city and its region during the Italian Wars. Charles VIII, Louis XII, and Francis I went several times to Grenoble. Its people consequently had to suffer from the exactions of the soldiers. The nobility of the region took part in various battles (Marignano, Pavia) and in doing so gained significant prestige.[20] The best-known of its members was Bayard, ""the knight without fear and beyond reproach"". Grenoble suffered as a result of the French Wars of Religion. The Dauphiné was indeed an important settlement for Protestants and therefore experienced several conflicts. The baron des Adrets, the leader of the Huguenots, pillaged the Cathedral of Grenoble and destroyed the tombs of the former Dauphins. In August 1575, Lesdiguières became the new leader of the Protestants and, thanks to the accession of Henry IV to the throne of France, allied himself with the governor and the lieutenant general of the Dauphiné. But this alliance did not bring an end to the conflicts. Indeed, a Catholic movement, the Ligue, which took Grenoble in December 1590, refused to make peace. After months of assaults, Lesdiguières defeated the Ligue and took back Grenoble. He became the leader of the entire province.[21] Lesdiguières became the lieutenant-general of the Dauphiné and administered the Province from 1591 to 1626. He began the construction of the Bastille in order to protect the city and ordered the construction of new walls, increasing the city's size. He also constructed the Hôtel Lesdiguières, built new fountains, and dug sewers.[22] In 1689, the bishop Étienne Le Camus launched the construction of Saint-Louis Church. From Louis XIV to the French Revolution[edit] Grenoble plan-relief (1848). Day of the Tiles, 1890 painting by Alexandre Debelle, (Musée de la Révolution française). The revocation of the Edict of Nantes by Louis XIV caused the departure of 2,000 Protestants from Grenoble, weakening the city's economy.[23] However, it also weakened the competing glove industry of Grasse, leaving the glove factories of Grenoble without any competition.[24] This allowed a stronger economic development for the city during the 18th century. At the beginning of that century, only 12 glovers made 15,000 dozen gloves each year; by 1787, 64 glovers made 160,000 dozen gloves each year.[24] The city gained some notoriety on 7 June 1788 when the townspeople assaulted troops of Louis XVI in the ""Day of the Tiles"".[9] The people attacked the royal troops to prevent an expulsion of the notables of the city, which would have seriously endangered the economic prosperity of Grenoble. Following these events, the Assembly of Vizille took place. Its members organized the meeting of the old Estates General, thus beginning the French Revolution. During the Revolution, Grenoble was represented in Paris by two illustrious notables, Jean Joseph Mounier and Antoine Barnave. In 1790, the Dauphiné was divided into three departments, and Grenoble became the chef-lieu of the Isère department. Only two refractory priests were executed at Grenoble during the Reign of Terror.[25] Pope Pius VI, prisoner of France, spent two days at Grenoble in 1799[26] before going to Valence where he died. 19th century[edit] Ramparts close to the Porte Saint Laurent The establishment of the Empire was overwhelmingly approved (in Isère, the results showed 82,084 yes and only 12 no).[27] Grenoble welcomed for the second time a prisoner Pope in 1809. Pius VII spent 10 days in the city en route to his exile in Fontainebleau. In 1813 Grenoble was under threat from the Austrian army, which invaded Switzerland and Savoy. The well-defended city contained the Austrian attacks, and the French army defeated the Austrians, forcing them to withdraw at Geneva. However, the later invasion of France in 1814 resulted in the capitulation of the troops and the occupation of the city. During his return from the island of Elba in 1815, Napoleon took a road that led him near Grenoble at Laffrey. There he met the Royalist Régiment d'Angouleme (former 5th) of Louis XVIII's Royal Army. Napoleon stepped towards the soldiers and said these famous words: ""If there is among you a soldier who wants to kill his Emperor, here I am."" The soldiers all joined his cause. After that, Napoleon was acclaimed at Grenoble and General Jean Gabriel Marchand could not prevent Napoleon from entering the city through the Bonne gate. He said later: ""From Cannes to Grenoble, I still was an adventurer; in that last city, I came back a sovereign"".[28] But after the defeat of Waterloo, the region suffered from a new invasion of Austrian and Sardinian troops. Fountain of the Three Orders (1897) The 19th century saw significant industrial development of Grenoble. The glove factories reached their Golden Age, and their products were exported to the United States, the United Kingdom, and Russia.[29] General Haxo transformed the Bastille fortress, which took on its present aspect between 1824 and 1848. The Second Empire saw the construction of the French railway network, and the first trains arrived at Grenoble in 1858. Shortly thereafter Grenoble experienced widespread destruction by extensive flooding in 1859,. In 1869 engineer Aristide Bergès played a major role in industrializing hydroelectricity production. With the development of his paper mills, he accelerated the economic development of the Grésivaudan valley and Grenoble. On 4 August 1897, a stone and bronze fountain was inaugurated in Grenoble to commemorate the pre-revolutionary events of June 1788. Built by the sculptor Henri Ding, the Fountain of the Three Orders, which represents three characters, is located on the Place Notre-Dame. People in Grenoble interpret these characters as follows: ""Is it raining?"" inquires the third estate; ""Please heaven it had rained"", lament the clergy; and ""It will rain"", proclaims the nobility.[30] 20th century[edit] World War I accelerated Grenoble's economic development.[31] In order to sustain the war effort, new hydroelectric industries developed along the various rivers of the region, and several existing companies moved into the armaments industry (for example in Livet-et-Gavet). Electro-chemical factories were also established in the area surrounding Grenoble, initially to produce chemical weapons. This development resulted in significant immigration to Grenoble, particularly from Italian workers who settled in the Saint-Laurent neighborhood. Gate of the exposition in 1925 The economic development of the city was highlighted by the organization of the International Exhibition of Hydropower and Tourism in 1925, which was visited by more than 1 million people.[32][circular reference] The organization of this exhibition forced the military to remove the old city walls and allowed expansion of the city to the south. This exhibition also highlighted the city's hydropower industry and the region's tourist attractions. The site of the exhibition became an urban park in 1926, named Parc Paul Mistral after the death of the mayor in 1932. The only building of this exhibition remaining in the park is the crumbling Tour Perret, which has been closed to the public since 1960 due to its very poor state of maintenance. World War II[edit] During World War II, at the Battle of the Alps, the Nazi invasion was stopped near Grenoble at Voreppe by the forces of General Cartier in June 1940. The French forces resisted until the armistice. Grenoble was then part of the French State, before an Italian occupation from 1942 to 1943. The relative mercy of the Italian occupiers towards the Jewish populations resulted in a significant number moving to the region from the German-occupied parts of France.[33] Grenoble was extremely active in the Résistance against the occupation. Its action was symbolized by figures such as Eugène Chavant, Léon Martin, and Marie Reynoard.[34] The University of Grenoble supported the clandestine operations and provided false documentation for young people to prevent them from being assigned to STO. In September 1943, German troops occupied Grenoble, escalating the conflict with the clandestine movements. On 11 November 1943 (the anniversary of the armistice of 1918) massive strikes and demonstrations took place in front of the local collaboration offices. In response, the occupiers arrested 400 demonstrators in the streets. On 13 November, the resistance blew up the artillery at the Polygon, which was a psychological shock for an enemy who then intensified the repression. On 25 November, the occupiers killed 11 members of the Résistance organizations of Grenoble. This violent crackdown was nicknamed ""Grenoble's Saint-Bartholomew"".[35] From these events, Grenoble was styled by the Free French Forces the title of Capital of the Maquis on the antennas of the BBC.[36] This event only intensified the activities of Grenoble's resistance movements. The Germans could not prevent the destruction of their new arsenal on 2 December at the Bonne Barracks. After the Normandy landing, resistance operations reached their peak, with numerous attacks considerably hampering the activity of German troops. With the landing in Provence, German troops evacuated the city on 22 August 1944. On 5 November 1944, General Charles de Gaulle came to Grenoble and bestowed on the city the Compagnon de la Libération in order to recognise ""a heroic city at the peak of the French resistance and combat for the liberation"".[34] Post-war[edit] In 1955, future physics Nobel prize laureate Louis Néel created the Grenoble Center for Nuclear Studies (CENG), resulting in the birth of the Grenoble model, a combination of research and industry. The first stone was laid in December 1956. In 1968 Grenoble hosted the Xth Olympic Winter Games. This event helped modernize the city with the development of infrastructure such as an airport, motorways, a new town hall, and a new train station.[37] It also helped the development of ski resorts like Chamrousse, Les Deux Alpes, and Villard-de-Lans.[38] Geography[edit] Grenoble with the Dauphiné Alps Grenoble is surrounded by mountains. To the north lies the Chartreuse, to the south and west the Vercors, and to the east the Belledonne range. Grenoble is regarded as the capital of the French Alps. Except for a few dozen houses on the slopes of the Bastille hill of Chartreuse, Grenoble is exclusively built on the alluvial plain of the rivers Isère and Drac at an altitude of 214 metres (702 ft). As a result, the city itself is extremely flat. Mountain sports are an important tourist attraction in summer and winter. Twenty large and small ski resorts surround the city, the nearest being Le Sappey-en-Chartreuse, which is about 15 minutes' drive away. Historically, both Grenoble and the surrounding areas were sites of heavy industry and mining.[39] Abandoned mills and factories can be found in small towns and villages, and a few have been converted to tourist attractions, such as the coal mine at La Mure. Climate[edit] Under the Köppen system, Grenoble itself has an atypical humid subtropical climate (Cfa), with mountain influence. A climate that is well different from that of its airport (Alpes-Isère Airport), located 36.5 km (22.7 mi) further north-west and 180 m (591 ft) higher. Thus, the climate within the city (further southeast and lower in altitude) results in much hotter summers and cold but not harsh winters. The 3rd of January 1971, Alpes-Isère Airport recorded a record low of −27.1 °C (−16.8 °F). On the same day, Grenoble itself only recorded −12 °C (10 °F). In summary, Alpes-Isère Airport is quite close from a warm-summer humid continental climate (Dfb) with its harsh winters and moderate summers, although under the Köppen system it features an oceanic climate (Cfb).

Innovative business activities as Apple Inc.[46] co-exist with housing, sporting facilities, contemporary music venue and arts centres as Le Magasin. At the entrance to the Bouchayer-Viallet site, Square des Fusillés has been redeveloped and extended taking over an old car park, to facilitate access from the tramway stop and Cours Berriat. Redevelopment of the former De Bonne barracks was an important step in the drive to launch sustainable housing in France. In 2009, the site of De Bonne was distinguished as the best eco-neighborhood in France.[47] A shopping mall contains 53 shops arranged around an inner concourse, with one side opening onto the park and the other connecting to the town. Main sights[edit] The Bastille from downtown, with the Memorial at the back, on the top of the hill La Bastille[edit] The Bastille, an ancient series of fortifications on the mountainside, overlooks Grenoble on the northern side and is visible from many points in the city. The Bastille is one of Grenoble's most visited tourist attractions and provides a good vantage point over both the town below and the surrounding mountains. ""Les Bulles"": the cable cars The Bastille fort was begun in the Middle Ages, and later centuries saw extensive additions, including a semi-underground defense network. The Bastille has been credited as the most extensive example of early 18th-century fortifications in all of France. It then held an important strategic point on the French Alpine frontier with the Kingdom of Savoy.[48] The first cable transport system, installed on the Bastille in 1875, was built by the Porte de France Cement Company for freight. This cable transport system connected a quarry on Mount Jalla, just over the Bastille, and Grenoble. It was abandoned in the early 20th century. Since 1934, the Bastille has been the destination of the ""Grenoble-Bastille cable car"". This system of mostly transparent egg-shaped cable cars known to locals as ""Les Bulles"" (the bubbles) provides the occupants with an excellent view over the Isère. At the top are two restaurants and installed in the casemates of the fort itself since June 2006, the Bastille Art Centre allows visitors to see contemporary art exhibitions. There is also a small military museum on mountain troops (Musée des troupes de montagne) and, since 2000, a memorial to the mountain troops (Mémorial national des troupes de montagne) further along the road, on top of the hill. Palace of the Parliament of Dauphiné[edit] Palace of the Parliament of Dauphiné This renaissance palace was constructed at the Place Saint André around 1500 and extended in 1539. It was the location of the Parlement of Dauphiné until the French Revolution. It then became the Grenoble courthouse, until the courts were moved to a modern building in 2002. The left wing of the palace was extended in 1897. The front of the former seat of the nearby Dauphiné Parlement combines elements from a gothic chapel and a Renaissance façade.[49] The building now belongs to the Isère Council (Conseil Général de l'Isère). An ongoing renovation project will give this building a new life whilst preserving its patrimonial character and adding a modern touch.[50] Museum of Grenoble[edit] The city's most prized museum, the Museum of Grenoble (Musée de Grenoble), welcomes 200,000 visitors a year. It is primarily renowned for its extensive paintings collection, which covers all artistic evolutions. In the early 20th century the Museum of Grenoble became the first French museum to open its collections to modern art, and its collection of modern and contemporary art has grown to become one of the largest in Europe. The painting holdings include works by painters such as Veronese, Rubens, Zurbarán, Ingres, Delacroix, Renoir, Gauguin, Signac, Monet, Matisse, Picasso, Kandinsky, Joan Miró, Paul Klee, Giorgio de Chirico and Andy Warhol. The museum also presents a few Egyptian antiquities as well as Greek and Roman artifacts. The Sculpture collection features works by Auguste Rodin, Matisse, Alberto Giacometti and Alexander Calder. In April 2010, the prophetess of Antinoe, a 6th-century mummy discovered in 1907 in the Coptic necropolis of Antinoe in Middle Egypt, returned to the Museum of Grenoble, after more than fifty years of absence and an extensive restoration. Archaeological museums[edit] Archaeological museum with the vestiges protected by a new cover of glass and metal (Place Saint-Laurent) Situated on the right bank of the Isère, on Place Saint-Laurent, the Grenoble Archaeological Museum presents the archaeological excavations done on its location. The vestiges date back all the way to the 3rd century AD and provide a timeline of the history of Christianity in the region. The museum is situated below a 12th-century Benedictine church, under which Jacques Joseph Champollion-Figeac, brother of famed egyptologist Jean-François Champollion, discovered a Roman church in 1803. It was one of the first classified monuments in France thanks to the intervention of Prosper Mérimée, historic monument inspector.[51] Systematic excavations were conducted from 1978 to 2011, as part of a regional research program on the evolution of churches during the Middle Ages. After eight years of work, the museum reopened 6 May 2011. The Musée de l'Ancien Évêché is the second archaeological museum of the city, and located near the Grenoble Cathedral. Installed in 1998, it houses the first baptistery of the city The Grenoble townhall hosts a bust of Stendhal by sculptor Pierre Charles Lenoir Education and science[edit] Secondary level[edit] The large community of both foreign students and foreign researchers prompted the creation of an international school. The Cité Scolaire Internationale Europole (CSI Europole) was formerly housed within the Lycée Stendhal across from the Maison du Tourisme, but later moved to its own building in the Europole [fr] district. In the centre of the city, two schools have provided education to the isérois for more than three centuries. The oldest one, the Lycée Stendhal, was founded in 1651[52] as a Jesuit College. An astronomical and astrological sundial created in the main building of the college in 1673 can still be visited today. The second-oldest higher education establishment of Grenoble is the Lycée Champollion, completed in 1887 to offer excellent education to both high school students and students of preparatory classes. Higher education[edit] Campus of the Université Grenoble Alpes. The city is an important university centre with over 54,000 students in 2013, of whom 16% arrive from abroad.[53] In a 1339 pontificial bull, Pope Benedict XII commissioned the establishment of the University of Grenoble. In 1965, the university mostly relocated from downtown to a suburban main campus outside of the city in Saint Martin d'Hères (with some parts in Gières). However, smaller campuses remain both downtown and in the northwestern part of the city known as the Polygone Scientifique (""Scientific Polygon""). From 1970 to 2015, the university was divided into four separate institutions sharing the campus grounds, some buildings and laboratories, and even part of their administration: Grenoble I – Joseph Fourier University (sciences, health, technologies) Grenoble II – Pierre Mendès-France University (social sciences) which includes the Institute of political studies Grenoble III – Stendhal University (humanities) Grenoble Institute of Technology (INPG or Grenoble-INP) is a federation of engineering colleges. On 1 January 2016, the first three of those merged back to form the Université Grenoble Alpes. Grenoble Campus of the ENAC Campuses of the École nationale de l'aviation civile (French civil aviation university), École d'Architecture de Grenoble ( School of Architecture of Grenoble) and Grenoble École de Management (Grenoble School of Management) are also located in Grenoble. Science and engineering[edit] Site of European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Institut Laue-Langevin and European Molecular Biology Laboratory at the Western end of the Polygone Scientifique Grenoble is a major scientific centre, especially in the fields of physics, computer science, and applied mathematics: Universite Joseph Fourier (UJF) is one of the leading French scientific universities while the Grenoble Institute of Technology trains more than 5,000 engineers every year in key technology disciplines. Grenoble's high tech expertise is organized mainly around three domains: information technology, biotechnologies and new technologies of energy.[54] Many fundamental and applied scientific research laboratories are conjointly managed by Joseph Fourier University, Grenoble Institute of Technology, and the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS). Numerous other scientific laboratories are managed independently or in collaboration with the CNRS and the French National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Control (INRIA). Other research centres in or near Grenoble include the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), the Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL), the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), the Institut de radioastronomie millimétrique, one of the main research facilities of the Commissariat à l'Énergie Atomique (Nuclear Energy Commission, CEA), the LNCMI and the European branch of Xerox Research (whose most notable center was PARC). Leti and the recent development of Minatec, a centre for innovation in micro- and nano-technology, only increases Grenoble's position as a European scientific centre.[55] Biotechnologies are also well represented in the Grenoble region with the molecular biology research center BioMérieux, the Clinatec center, the regional center NanoBio and many ramifications of the global competitiveness cluster Lyonbiopôle.[56] Meanwhile, Grenoble has large laboratories related to space and to the understanding and observation of the universe as the Institut de radioastronomie millimétrique, the Institut de planétologie et d'astrophysique de Grenoble,[57] the Laboratoire de physique subatomique et de cosmologie de Grenoble, the Institut Néel but also to a lesser extent the Institut des sciences de la Terre (part of the Observatoire des Sciences de l'Univers de Grenoble). In order to foster this technological cluster university institutions and research organizations united to create the GIANT (Grenoble Innovation for Advanced New Technologies) Campus[58] with the aim at becoming one of the world's top campuses in research, higher education, and high tech.[59] The city benefits from the highest concentration of strategic jobs in France after Paris, with 14% of the employments, 35,186 jobs, 45% of which specialized in design and research.[60] Grenoble is also the largest research center in France after Paris with 22,800 jobs (11,800 in public research, 7,500 in private research and 3,500 PhD students).[61] Grenoble is also renowned for the excellence of its academic research in humanities and political sciences. Its universities, alongside public scientific institutions, host some of the largest research centres in France (in fields such as political science, urban planning or the sociology of organizations). Knowledge and innovation community[edit] Grenoble is one of the co-location centres of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology's Knowledge and Innovation Communities for sustainable energy.[62] Security and Crime[edit] Although a medium-sized city (but located in a large urban area), Grenoble's criminality presents a face close to that of the Parisian or Marseille cities, a character judged by the police as ""exceptional, given the size of the city""[citation needed] In 2015, Pierre Tholly, south-east manager of the police union Alliance, described the agglomeration of Grenoble as ""particularly difficult for 30 years"" and considers the shootings that took place that year as ""proof of a"" trivialization ""of extreme violence in the city. ”The city is particularly affected by a“ gang war ”(ten deaths between 2007 and 2008, 4 deaths in 2015) against a background of drug trafficking.[citation needed] According to the newspaper L'Express in 2016, “Grenoble suffers from a bad image in terms of security”. For several years, the city has been plagued by ""sometimes spectacular urban violence"". During his visit on January 18, 2016, Bernard Cazeneuve, Minister of the Interior, underlined the worrying increase in delinquency in the Grenoble conurbation.[citation needed] According to the Grenoble public prosecutor, for the first ten months of 2017, the figures for delinquency in the agglomeration were + 10% for burglaries, + 8% for burnt vehicles, + 26% for thefts with violence and + 42% for violent theft with a weapon. For the whole of 2017, despite a stable overall violence figure, violent thefts increased by 21%. The prosecutor judges the level of burglaries in the Grenoble conurbation ""very high"". He points to the phenomenon of foreign minors “hired by drug traffickers in the Mistral district. "". In 2018, after the deliberate fires of the CCSTI of Grenoble, and of the gendarmeries of Grenoble and Meylan claimed by the anarchist movement, then of the Prémol theater, of the Lucie-Aubrac college, the media wondered about an impressive series of fires of shops in the Grenoble area. The same year, the police union Alliance, which qualifies the city of “French Chicago”, points to a “63% higher delinquency” in the Alpine city “than in cities of the same size”.[citation needed] On August 6, 2020, the Alliance police union spoke of an “alarming situation” with seven shootings leaving three dead, two seriously injured and one slightly injured since the beginning of the summer. The same year, an opinion survey indicates that 79% of Grenoblois believe that safety is a major issue for the city, with one in two people questioned saying they have been the victim of a crime.[citation needed] Economy[edit] Industry occupies a large part of the local economy. High-tech industries have a significant presence, especially in the field of semiconductors, electronics and biotechnology. STMicroelectronics, Schneider Electric and Soitec have major manufacturing and R&D facilities. Traditional industries in fields such as heavy equipment manufacturing and chemistry are still present and include Caterpillar, GE Renewable Energy and Arkema. The town was once famous for glove manufacturing, for which Xavier Jouvin [fr] introduced an innovative technique in the 19th century.[63] A few small companies keep producing gloves for a very high end market. Companies[edit] Head office of Glénat In 2011, the largest employers in the Grenoble metropolitan area were:[64] Enterprise, location Number of employees Sector STMicroelectronics, Grenoble and Crolles 5,979 Semiconductor manufacturing, R&D Schneider Electric, Grenoble agglomeration 4,915 Electrical equipment, R&D Caterpillar France, Grenoble and Echirolles 1,865 Construction of heavy equipment Hewlett Packard France, Eybens 1,814 Computer science Becton Dickinson, Pont-de-Claix 1,736 R&D and production of advanced systems for drugs administration Carrefour, Grenoble agglomeration 1,165 Hypermarkets Capgemini, Grenoble 1,100 Information technology consulting and IT service management Groupe Casino, Grenoble agglomeration 990 Supermarkets Samse, Grenoble agglomeration 965 Supplier of building materials Soitec, Bernin 952 Semiconductor manufacturer specialized in the production of SOI wafers The presence of companies such as HP or Caterpillar in the area has drawn many American and British workers to Grenoble, especially in the surrounding mountain villages. The region has the second largest English-speaking community in France, after Paris.[65] That community has an English-speaking Church and supports the International School.[66] Many of these Americans, British, Australians etc. go to Grenoble with the intention of returning home after some time but the mountains and general life style often keep them there. Some choose to put their children in the international school ""cité internationale"", while the ""American School of Grenoble"" is the alternative for those who prefer to have the core curriculum in English. With numerous associations like Open House, this large English speaking population organizes family events making life in Grenoble harder to turn away from.[67] Publisher Glénat has its head office in Grenoble.[68] Inovallée is a science park with about 12,000 jobs located at Meylan and Montbonnot-Saint-Martin near Grenoble.[69] Media[edit] téléGrenoble Isère is the local TV channel with France 3 Alpes. The local newspaper is Le Dauphiné libéré. Sport[edit] Stade des Alpes Grenoble hosted the 1968 Winter Olympics. The city is surrounded by ski resorts nestled in the surrounding mountains. Stade Lesdiguières is located in Grenoble and has been the venue for international rugby league and rugby union games. Grenoble is the home of first rugby union, FC Grenoble, and ice hockey teams, Brûleurs de loups, and a second-tier football team, Grenoble Foot 38, . Six-Days of Grenoble, a six-day track cycling race held since 1971 The via ferrata Grenoble is a climbing route located on the hill of the Bastille in Grenoble. The abundance of natural sites around Grenoble as well as the particular influence of mountaineering practices and history make many Grenoble inhabitants very fond of sports and outdoor activities (e.g., hiking, mountain biking, backcountry skiing, rock climbing, and paragliding). The Tour de France cycling race regularly passes through the city. Transport[edit] See also: Grenoble tramway The railway station and a tram (lightrail). A comprehensive bus and tram service operates 26 bus routes and five tram lines. It serves much of greater Grenoble, while a new cable car system known as the Métrocâble is scheduled to be completed in 2021. Being essentially flat, Grenoble is also a bicycle-friendly city. The Gare de Grenoble is served by the TGV rail network, with frequent high-speed services (3 hours) to and from Paris-Gare de Lyon, usually with a stop at Lyon Saint-Exupéry Airport. While Grenoble is not directly on any high-speed line, TGVs can run at reduced speeds on the classic network and enable such connections. Local rail services connect Grenoble with Lyon, and less frequently to Geneva, to Valence, and to destinations to the South. Valence and Lyon to the West provides connections with TGV services along the Rhône Valley. Rail and road connections to the South are less developed. Grenoble can be accessed by air from Grenoble-Isère Airport, Lyon Saint-Exupéry Airport and Geneva International Airport, with the airport bus connections being most frequent to Lyon Saint-Exupéry. I-Road in Grenoble Highways link Grenoble to the other major cities in the area including the A48 autoroute to the northwest toward Lyon, the A49 to the southwest toward the Rhone valley via Valence, the A41 to the northeast toward Chambéry, the Alps, and Italy and Switzerland. A partial ring road around the south of the city, the Rocade Sud, connects the motorway arriving from the northwest (A48) with that arriving from the northeast (A41). A project to complete the ring road, with a tunnel under the Bastille as part of the likely routes, was rejected after its environmental impact studies.[70] From 2014 to 2017, the city of Grenoble tested the rental of seventy I-Road electric vehicles. In 2016, the speed limit was lowered to 30 km/h (18.6 mph) in 80% of the streets of Grenoble and forty-two neighboring municipalities, to both improve safety and reduce pollution levels,. The limit however remains 50 km/h on the main arteries.[71] Culture[edit] Le Magasin contemporary art centre. Grenoble hosts several festivals: the Détours de Babel in March,[72] the Open Air Short Film Festival in early July, and the Cabaret Frappé music festival at the end of July. The Summum is the biggest concert hall in Grenoble, and the most famous artists produce there. Another big hall, Le grand angle, is located nearby in Voiron. Smaller halls in the city include the Salle Olivier Messiaen in the Minim Monastery. The main cultural center of the city is called MC2 (for Maison de la culture, version 2), which hosts music, theater, and dance performances. The Conservatory of Grenoble is founded in 1935. There are several theaters in Grenoble, the main one being Grenoble Municipal Theatre (Théatre de Grenoble). Others are the Théâtre de Création, the Théâtre Prémol, and the Théâtre 145. Grenoble also hosts Upstage Productions, which performs once a year through an exclusively English speaking troupe. There are two main art centres in Grenoble: the Centre national d'Art contemporain (also called Le Magasin) and the Centre d'art Bastille. Grenoble is known for its walnuts, Noix de Grenoble [fr] which enjoy an appellation of controlled origin.[73] The town also hosts a well-known comics publisher, Glénat. People from Grenoble[edit] Further information: List of people from Grenoble International relations[edit] See also: List of twin towns and sister cities in France After World War I, one street in the centre of Smederevska Palanka (Serbia) was named French street (Francuska ulica) and one street in Grenoble was named Palanka street(Rue de Palanka).

Industrial pioneers of a century ago found that after mastering hydraulic power and creating the initial industrial applications, they had also created a need for well-trained engineers. The first of its type in France, Grenoble INP became polytechnical and grew continuously in scale, becoming the National Polytechnical Institute (INPG) in 1971 with Louis Néel, Nobel Laureate in Physics as its first President. Grenoble INP is currently contributing to the Minatec project, one of Europe's biggest nanosciences research center. Since December 2014, Grenoble Institute of Technology is member of the Community Grenoble Alpes University. The Grenoble Institute of Technology has been awarded the title ""European University"" by the European Commission. Together with 6 other European technical universities, the Grenoble Institute of Technology has formed the alliance UNITE! (University Network for Innovation, Technology and Engineering). The aim of the project is to create a trans-European campus, to introduce trans-European curricula, to promote scientific cooperation between the members and to strengthen knowledge transfer between the countries. The alliance includes Technische Universität Darmstadt, Aalto University, the Royal Institute of Technology, the Polytechnic University of Turin, the Polytechnic University of Catalonia and the University of Lisbon.[3] Organization[edit] Academic staff and researchers: 1250 teaching staff (350 permanent) 1400 researchers (300 permanent) 450 administrative and technical staff Students: (2014 figures)[4] 1,428 degree students 3,036 masters students 842 doctorate students The total number of students in 2014-2015 was 5,306 students, including 1,152 international students. Most of the students enter Grenoble INP after a two-year undergraduate program, the French classes préparatoires aux grandes écoles, the selection being made according to the results of an entrance exam. However a few students (less than 10%) can be admitted at the INPG without needing to take an entrance exam. Such students have to follow another two-year undergraduate program called the CPP Preparatory Course and to have a minimum entrance average at the end of the program. This program has been created by the French INPs in [1993] in order to attract even more French high school-leavers as well as students with particular sporting or musical talents. Each year, Grenoble INP graduates: (2004 figures) 1,046 engineers with a ""Diplôme d'ingénieur"" (five-year curricula) 332 DEA (master level) 146 [PhD] Schools[edit] The École nationale supérieure de l'énergie, l'eau et l'environnement or Ense3 (Energy, Water and Environmental Sciences), founded in 2008, created from the merge of the former schools ENSHMG and ENSIEG. The Ecole nationale supérieure d'informatique et de mathématiques appliquées de Grenoble or Ensimag, founded in 1960: trains engineers to master the design and use of computer and mathematical tools: VLSI and computer design, software engineering, telecommunications and networks, distributed applications and systems, image processing and synthesis, economic and financial systems modeling, scientific computation. The Département Télécommunications founded by ENSIMAG and ENSERG in 1999 has merged with Ensimag. The École nationale supérieure en systèmes avancés et réseaux or Esisar, was founded in 1995 and based in Valence. The school trains engineers to master technology of informations and of communication. The École nationale supérieure de génie industriel or Génie industriel founded in 1990, is the industrial and system engineering department of the institute. It trains engineers specialized in organization and technological management. Génie industriel was created from the merger of ENSGI and ENSHMG. The École internationale du papier, de la communication imprimée et des biomatériaux or Pagora, was founded in 1907 It trains engineers for the paper and graphics industries: physical chemistry and mechanics, process engineering, paper production and conversion, and printing techniques. The École nationale supérieure de physique, électronique et matériaux or Phelma (Physics, Applied Physics, Electronics and Materials Science), founded in 2008, created from the merge of the former schools ENSPG, ENSEEG and ENSERG. The École polytechnique universitaire de l'Institut Polytechnique de Grenoble or Polytech Grenoble, was founded in 2002. The school offers various courses of modern technological fields. The Institut d'administration des entreprises de Grenoble or Grenoble IAE, was founded in 1956. It is the public management school of the Grenoble Alpes University.[5] Former schools[edit] In 2008, some schools merged, and some other changed their names. From ten schools or departments, the group reorganized the courses and reduced the number of schools down to eight.[6][7] Département Télécommunications (ENSIMAG-ENSERG), founded in 1999: trains engineers to master the design and use of computer and telecommunication tools: VLSI and computer design, software engineering, telecommunications and networks, electronics. It merged in 2008 with Ensimag. École Nationale Supérieure de Physique de Grenoble (ENSPG), founded in 1985: trains engineers in physical sciences, nanotechnologies, materials science, electronic and optoelectronic devices, energy and nuclear engineering and physical instrumentation. ENSPG trains physics engineers with a strong scientific background. Graduates are employed mainly in basic and applied research or in development. Its activity was transferred in 2008 in the new school Phelma. École Nationale Supérieure d'Électrochimie et d'Électrométallurgie de Grenoble (ENSEEG), founded in 1921: trains engineers in the fields of physical chemistry, materials science, process engineering and electrochemistry. Its activity was transferred in 2008 in the new school Phelma. École nationale supérieure d'électronique et de radioélectricité de Grenoble (ENSERG), founded in 1958: trains engineers in electronics from basic components to complex circuits and telecommunications systems, image and word processing, computer and multimedia systems. Its activity was transferred in 2008 in the new school Phelma. École nationale supérieure d'ingénieurs électriciens de Grenoble (ENSIEG), founded in 1901: trains engineers in electrical engineering and its industrial applications of production and transformation, systems automation, production systems, robotics and signal processing. Its activity was transferred in 2008 in the new school Ense3. École Nationale Supérieure d'Hydraulique et de Mécanique de Grenoble (ENSHMG), founded in 1928; trained engineers in the fields of fluid mechanics, hydraulics and water resources, environmental sciences and mechanical engineering. Its activity was transferred in 2008 in the new school Ense3. Alumni[edit] Jean-Jacques Favier. French astronaut.Charles Elachi. Director of Jet Propulsion Lab.

However, the G-INP Institute of Engineering & Management UGA (note new full title) along with all such similar Engineering Schools is mainly concerned with educating France's future elite. Students are prepared from the beginning for Project Leader and higher management roles in industry and research.Read more > Pros Close contact with industry. Many tutors involved in top-level research. Outside of Paris, Grenoble is one of the main hubs for technology. Great for outdoor life in the mountains Cons Too many classes in the week and not enough opportunity to think autonomously. Some students arrive without having reflected upon who they really are and what they would really like to do - might have been better off studying pure science at university! Useful  |  1 “Sustainable Industrial Engineering” Noble E France, GraduateEngineering Overall This course addresses the issue of sustainability of the industry in three ways: from an environmental point of view, from a social and societal point of view, from an economical point of view. It is English taught and open to international students. It has a cheaper cost in comparison to some other industrial engineering schools in Europe.Read more > Pros Opportunity to meet people of varying cultures and nationalities. Cons Too many lectures in a week, and some courses are quite difficult for students from non-engineering background. Also, finding the end of study internship, for students with low french levels is very difficult Useful  |  1 Katherine R Iowa State University, Ames, United States Engineering, Mechanical, Undergraduate, Independent Academic Course recommendations Pick carefully, and have a good dictionary in case the language of instruction changes.Read more > My academic experiences Quality of courses Variety of courses Access to resources Interaction with teachers Interaction with international students Interaction with local students Read full review Useful  |  1 “Ecole d'ingnieur en Gnie Industriel” La B France, GraduateEngineering Overall La formation est trs diversifie.

Paris (French pronunciation: ​[paʁi] (listen)) is the capital and most populous city of France, with an estimated population of 2,175,601 residents as of 2018[update], in an area of more than 105 square kilometres (41 square miles).[4] Since the 17th century, Paris has been one of Europe's major centres of finance, diplomacy, commerce, fashion, gastronomy, science, and arts. The City of Paris is the centre and seat of government of the region and province of Île-de-France, or Paris Region, which has an estimated population of 12,174,880, or about 18 percent of the population of France as of 2017[update].[5] The Paris Region had a GDP of €709 billion ($808 billion) in 2017.[6] According to the Economist Intelligence Unit Worldwide Cost of Living Survey in 2018, Paris was the second most expensive city in the world, after Singapore and ahead of Zürich, Hong Kong, Oslo, and Geneva.[7] Another source ranked Paris as most expensive, on a par with Singapore and Hong Kong, in 2018.[8][9] Paris is a major railway, highway, and air-transport hub served by two international airports: Paris–Charles de Gaulle (the second-busiest airport in Europe) and Paris–Orly.[10][11] Opened in 1900, the city's subway system, the Paris Métro, serves 5.23 million passengers daily;[12] it is the second busiest metro system in Europe after the Moscow Metro. Gare du Nord is the 24th-busiest railway station in the world, but the first located outside Japan, with 262 million passengers in 2015.[13] Paris is especially known for its museums and architectural landmarks: the Louvre was the most visited art museum in the world in 2019, with 9.6 million visitors,[14][15] and remained the most-visited art museum in 2020 when the number of visitors dropped to 2.7 million due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[16] The Musée d'Orsay, Musée Marmottan Monet and Musée de l'Orangerie are noted for their collections of French Impressionist art. The Pompidou Centre Musée National d'Art Moderne has the largest collection of modern and contemporary art in Europe. The Musée Rodin and Musée Picasso exhibit the works of two noted Parisians. The historical district along the Seine in the city centre is classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site; popular landmarks there include the Cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris on the Île de la Cité, now closed for renovation after the 15 April 2019 fire. Other popular tourist sites include the Gothic royal chapel of Sainte-Chapelle, also on the Île de la Cité; the Eiffel Tower, constructed for the Paris Universal Exposition of 1889; the Grand Palais and Petit Palais, built for the Paris Universal Exposition of 1900; the Arc de Triomphe on the Champs-Élysées, and the hill of Montmartre with its artistic history and its Basilica of Sacré-Coeur. Paris received 38 million visitors in 2019, measured by hotel stays, with the largest numbers of foreign visitors coming from the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and China.[17] It was ranked as the second-most-visited travel destination in the world in 2019, after Bangkok and just ahead of London.[18] Due to the city's international recognition, a number of places around the world, such as Bucharest and Leipzig, have been nicknamed Little Paris. The football club Paris Saint-Germain and the rugby union club Stade Français are based in Paris. The 80,000-seat Stade de France, built for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, is located just north of Paris in the neighbouring commune of Saint-Denis. Paris hosts the annual French Open Grand Slam tennis tournament on the red clay of Roland Garros. The city hosted the Olympic Games in 1900, 1924 and will host the 2024 Summer Olympics. The 1938 and 1998 FIFA World Cups, the 2007 Rugby World Cup, as well as the 1960, 1984 and 2016 UEFA European Championships were also held in the city. Every July, the Tour de France bicycle race finishes on the Avenue des Champs-Élysées in Paris.

The ancient oppidum that corresponds to the modern city of Paris was first mentioned in the mid-1st century BC by Julius Caesar as Luteciam Parisiorum ('Lutetia of the Parisii'), and is later attested as Parision in the 5th century AD, then as Paris in 1265.[19][20] During the Roman period, it was commonly known as Lutetia or Lutecia in Latin, and as Leukotekía in Greek, which is interpreted as either stemming from the Celtic root *lukot- ('mouse'), or from *luto- ('marsh, swamp'), depending on whether the Latin or Greek form is the closest to the original Celtic name.[21][22][20] The name Paris is derived from its early inhabitants, the Parisii, a Gallic tribe from the Iron Age and the Roman period.[23] The meaning of the Gaulish ethnonym remains debated. According to Xavier Delamarre, it may derive from the Celtic root pario- ('cauldron').[23] Alfred Holder interpreted the name as 'the makers' or 'the commanders', by comparing it to the Welsh peryff ('lord, commander'), both possibly descending from a Proto-Celtic form reconstructed as *kwar-is-io-.[24] Alternatively, Pierre-Yves Lambert proposed to translate Parisii as the 'spear people', by connecting the first element to the Old Irish carr ('spear'), derived from an earlier *kwar-sā.[20] In any case, the city's name is not related to the Paris of Greek mythology. Paris is often referred to as the 'City of Light' (La Ville Lumière),[25] both because of its leading role during the Age of Enlightenment and more literally because Paris was one of the first large European cities to use gas street lighting on a grand scale on its boulevards and monuments. Gas lights were installed on the Place du Carrousel, Rue de Rivoli and Place Vendome in 1829. By 1857, the Grand boulevards were lit.[26] By the 1860s, the boulevards and streets of Paris were illuminated by 56,000 gas lamps.[27] Since the late 19th century, Paris has also been known as Panam(e) (pronounced [panam]) in French slang.[28] Inhabitants are known in English as ""Parisians"" and in French as Parisiens ([paʁizjɛ̃] (listen)). They are also pejoratively called Parigots ([paʁiɡo] (listen)).[note 1][29] History[edit] Main articles: History of Paris and Timeline of Paris Origins[edit] Main article: Lutetia The Parisii, a sub-tribe of the Celtic Senones, inhabited the Paris area from around the middle of the 3rd century BC.[30][31] One of the area's major north–south trade routes crossed the Seine on the île de la Cité; this meeting place of land and water trade routes gradually became an important trading centre.[32] The Parisii traded with many river towns (some as far away as the Iberian Peninsula) and minted their own coins for that purpose.[33] Gold coins minted by the Parisii (1st century BC) The Romans conquered the Paris Basin in 52 BC and began their settlement on Paris' Left Bank.[34] The Roman town was originally called Lutetia (more fully, Lutetia Parisiorum, ""Lutetia of the Parisii"", modern French Lutèce). It became a prosperous city with a forum, baths, temples, theatres, and an amphitheatre.[35] By the end of the Western Roman Empire, the town was known as Parisius, a Latin name that would later become Paris in French.[36] Christianity was introduced in the middle of the 3rd century AD by Saint Denis, the first Bishop of Paris: according to legend, when he refused to renounce his faith before the Roman occupiers, he was beheaded on the hill which became known as Mons Martyrum (Latin ""Hill of Martyrs""), later ""Montmartre"", from where he walked headless to the north of the city; the place where he fell and was buried became an important religious shrine, the Basilica of Saint-Denis, and many French kings are buried there.[37] Clovis the Frank, the first king of the Merovingian dynasty, made the city his capital from 508.[38] As the Frankish domination of Gaul began, there was a gradual immigration by the Franks to Paris and the Parisian Francien dialects were born. Fortification of the Île de la Cité failed to avert sacking by Vikings in 845, but Paris' strategic importance—with its bridges preventing ships from passing—was established by successful defence in the Siege of Paris (885–886), for which the then Count of Paris (comte de Paris), Odo of France, was elected king of West Francia.[39] From the Capetian dynasty that began with the 987 election of Hugh Capet, Count of Paris and Duke of the Franks (duc des Francs), as king of a unified Francia, Paris gradually became the largest and most prosperous city in France.[37] High and Late Middle Ages to Louis XIV[edit] See also: Paris in the Middle Ages, Paris in the 16th century, and Paris in the 17th century The Palais de la Cité and Sainte-Chapelle, viewed from the Left Bank, from the Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry (month of June) (1410) By the end of the 12th century, Paris had become the political, economic, religious, and cultural capital of France.[40] The Palais de la Cité, the royal residence, was located at the western end of the Île de la Cité. In 1163, during the reign of Louis VII, Maurice de Sully, bishop of Paris, undertook the construction of the Notre Dame Cathedral at its eastern extremity. After the marshland between the river Seine and its slower 'dead arm' to its north was filled in around the 10th century,[41] Paris' cultural centre began to move to the Right Bank. In 1137, a new city marketplace (today's Les Halles) replaced the two smaller ones on the Île de la Cité and Place de la Grève (Place de l'Hôtel de Ville).[42] The latter location housed the headquarters of Paris' river trade corporation, an organisation that later became, unofficially (although formally in later years), Paris' first municipal government. In the late 12th century, Philip Augustus extended the Louvre fortress to defend the city against river invasions from the west, gave the city its first walls between 1190 and 1215, rebuilt its bridges to either side of its central island, and paved its main thoroughfares.[43] In 1190, he transformed Paris' former cathedral school into a student-teacher corporation that would become the University of Paris and would draw students from all of Europe.[44][40] With 200,000 inhabitants in 1328, Paris, then already the capital of France, was the most populous city of Europe. By comparison, London in 1300 had 80,000 inhabitants.[45] The Hôtel de Sens, one of many remnants of the Middle Ages in Paris During the Hundred Years' War, Paris was occupied by England-friendly Burgundian forces from 1418, before being occupied outright by the English when Henry V of England entered the French capital in 1420;[46] in spite of a 1429 effort by Joan of Arc to liberate the city,[47] it would remain under English occupation until 1436. In the late 16th-century French Wars of Religion, Paris was a stronghold of the Catholic League, the organisers of 24 August 1572 St. Bartholomew's Day massacre in which thousands of French Protestants were killed.[48][49] The conflicts ended when pretender to the throne Henry IV, after converting to Catholicism to gain entry to the capital, entered the city in 1594 to claim the crown of France. This king made several improvements to the capital during his reign: he completed the construction of Paris' first uncovered, sidewalk-lined bridge, the Pont Neuf, built a Louvre extension connecting it to the Tuileries Palace, and created the first Paris residential square, the Place Royale, now Place des Vosges. In spite of Henry IV's efforts to improve city circulation, the narrowness of Paris' streets was a contributing factor in his assassination near Les Halles marketplace in 1610.[50] During the 17th century, Cardinal Richelieu, chief minister of Louis XIII, was determined to make Paris the most beautiful city in Europe. He built five new bridges, a new chapel for the College of Sorbonne, and a palace for himself, the Palais-Cardinal, which he bequeathed to Louis XIII. After Richelieu's death in 1642, it was renamed the Palais-Royal.[51] Due to the Parisian uprisings during the Fronde civil war, Louis XIV moved his court to a new palace, Versailles, in 1682. Although no longer the capital of France, arts and sciences in the city flourished with the Comédie-Française, the Academy of Painting, and the French Academy of Sciences. To demonstrate that the city was safe from attack, the king had the city walls demolished and replaced with tree-lined boulevards that would become the Grands Boulevards of today.[52] Other marks of his reign were the Collège des Quatre-Nations, the Place Vendôme, the Place des Victoires, and Les Invalides.[53] 18th and 19th centuries[edit] See also: Paris in the 18th century, Paris during the Second Empire, and Haussmann's renovation of Paris Paris grew in population from about 400,000 in 1640 to 650,000 in 1780.[54] A new boulevard, the Champs-Élysées, extended the city west to Étoile,[55] while the working-class neighbourhood of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine on the eastern site of the city grew more and more crowded with poor migrant workers from other regions of France.[56] Paris was the centre of an explosion of philosophic and scientific activity known as the Age of Enlightenment. Diderot and d'Alembert published their Encyclopédie in 1751, and the Montgolfier Brothers launched the first manned flight in a hot-air balloon on 21 November 1783, from the gardens of the Château de la Muette. Paris was the financial capital of continental Europe, the primary European centre of book publishing and fashion and the manufacture of fine furniture and luxury goods.[57] The storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789, by Jean-Pierre Houël In the summer of 1789, Paris became the centre stage for the French Revolution. On 14 July, a mob seized the arsenal at the Invalides, acquiring thousands of guns, and stormed the Bastille, a symbol of royal authority. The first independent Paris Commune, or city council, met in the Hôtel de Ville and, on 15 July, elected a Mayor, the astronomer Jean Sylvain Bailly.[58] Louis XVI and the royal family were brought to Paris and made prisoners within the Tuileries Palace. In 1793, as the revolution turned more and more radical, the king, queen, and the mayor were guillotined (executed) in the Reign of Terror, along with more than 16,000 others throughout France.[59] The property of the aristocracy and the church was nationalised, and the city's churches were closed, sold or demolished.[60] A succession of revolutionary factions ruled Paris until 9 November 1799 (coup d'état du 18 brumaire), when Napoléon Bonaparte seized power as First Consul.[61] The Panthéon, a major landmark on the Rive Gauche, was completed in 1790. The population of Paris had dropped by 100,000 during the Revolution, but between 1799 and 1815, it surged with 160,000 new residents, reaching 660,000.[62] Napoleon Bonaparte replaced the elected government of Paris with a prefect reporting only to him. He began erecting monuments to military glory, including the Arc de Triomphe, and improved the neglected infrastructure of the city with new fountains, the Canal de l'Ourcq, Père Lachaise Cemetery and the city's first metal bridge, the Pont des Arts.[62] During the Restoration, the bridges and squares of Paris were returned to their pre-Revolution names; the July Revolution in 1830 (commemorated by the July Column on the Place de la Bastille) brought a constitutional monarch, Louis Philippe I, to power. The first railway line to Paris opened in 1837, beginning a new period of massive migration from the provinces to the city.[62] Louis-Philippe was overthrown by a popular uprising in the streets of Paris in 1848. His successor, Napoleon III, alongside the newly appointed prefect of the Seine, Georges-Eugène Haussmann, launched a gigantic public works project to build wide new boulevards, a new opera house, a central market, new aqueducts, sewers and parks, including the Bois de Boulogne and Bois de Vincennes.[63] In 1860, Napoleon III also annexed the surrounding towns and created eight new arrondissements, expanding Paris to its current limits.[63] In the 1860s, Paris streets and monuments were illuminated by 56,000 gas lamps, giving it the name ""The City of Light""[64] During the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871), Paris was besieged by the Prussian Army. After months of blockade, hunger, and then bombardment by the Prussians, the city was forced to surrender on 28 January 1871. On 28 March, a revolutionary government called the Paris Commune seized power in Paris. The Commune held power for two months, until it was harshly suppressed by the French army during the ""Bloody Week"" at the end of May 1871.[65] The Eiffel Tower, under construction in November 1888, startled Parisians — and the world — with its modernity. Late in the 19th century, Paris hosted two major international expositions: the 1889 Universal Exposition, was held to mark the centennial of the French Revolution and featured the new Eiffel Tower; and the 1900 Universal Exposition, which gave Paris the Pont Alexandre III, the Grand Palais, the Petit Palais and the first Paris Métro line.[66] Paris became the laboratory of Naturalism (Émile Zola) and Symbolism (Charles Baudelaire and Paul Verlaine), and of Impressionism in art (Courbet, Manet, Monet, Renoir).[67] 20th and 21st centuries[edit] See also: Paris in the Belle Époque, Paris during the First World War, Paris between the Wars (1919–1939), Paris in World War II, and History of Paris (1946–2000) By 1901, the population of Paris had grown to about 2,715,000.[68] At the beginning of the century, artists from around the world including Pablo Picasso, Modigliani, and Henri Matisse made Paris their home. It was the birthplace of Fauvism, Cubism and abstract art,[69][70] and authors such as Marcel Proust were exploring new approaches to literature.[71] During the First World War, Paris sometimes found itself on the front line; 600 to 1,000 Paris taxis played a small but highly important symbolic role in transporting 6,000 soldiers to the front line at the First Battle of the Marne. The city was also bombed by Zeppelins and shelled by German long-range guns.[72] In the years after the war, known as Les Années Folles, Paris continued to be a mecca for writers, musicians and artists from around the world, including Ernest Hemingway, Igor Stravinsky, James Joyce, Josephine Baker, Eva Kotchever, Henry Miller, Anaïs Nin, Sidney Bechet[73] Allen Ginsberg[74] and the surrealist Salvador Dalí.[75] In the years after the peace conference, the city was also home to growing numbers of students and activists from French colonies and other Asian and African countries, who later became leaders of their countries, such as Ho Chi Minh, Zhou Enlai and Léopold Sédar Senghor.[76] General Charles de Gaulle on the Champs-Élysées celebrating the liberation of Paris, 26 August 1944 On 14 June 1940, the German army marched into Paris, which had been declared an ""open city"".[77] On 16–17 July 1942, following German orders, the French police and gendarmes arrested 12,884 Jews, including 4,115 children, and confined them during five days at the Vel d'Hiv (Vélodrome d'Hiver), from which they were transported by train to the extermination camp at Auschwitz. None of the children came back.[78][79] On 25 August 1944, the city was liberated by the French 2nd Armoured Division and the 4th Infantry Division of the United States Army. General Charles de Gaulle led a huge and emotional crowd down the Champs Élysées towards Notre Dame de Paris, and made a rousing speech from the Hôtel de Ville.[80] In the 1950s and the 1960s, Paris became one front of the Algerian War for independence; in August 1961, the pro-independence FLN targeted and killed 11 Paris policemen, leading to the imposition of a curfew on Muslims of Algeria (who, at that time, were French citizens). On 17 October 1961, an unauthorised but peaceful protest demonstration of Algerians against the curfew led to violent confrontations between the police and demonstrators, in which at least 40 people were killed, including some thrown into the Seine. The anti-independence Organisation armée secrète (OAS), for their part, carried out a series of bombings in Paris throughout 1961 and 1962.[81][82] In May 1968, protesting students occupied the Sorbonne and put up barricades in the Latin Quarter. Thousands of Parisian blue-collar workers joined the students, and the movement grew into a two-week general strike. Supporters of the government won the June elections by a large majority. The May 1968 events in France resulted in the break-up of the University of Paris into 13 independent campuses.[83] In 1975, the National Assembly changed the status of Paris to that of other French cities and, on 25 March 1977, Jacques Chirac became the first elected mayor of Paris since 1793.[84] The Tour Maine-Montparnasse, the tallest building in the city at 57 storeys and 210 metres (689 feet) high, was built between 1969 and 1973. It was highly controversial, and it remains the only building in the centre of the city over 32 storeys high.[85] The population of Paris dropped from 2,850,000 in 1954 to 2,152,000 in 1990, as middle-class families moved to the suburbs.[86] A suburban railway network, the RER (Réseau Express Régional), was built to complement the Métro; the Périphérique expressway encircling the city, was completed in 1973.[87] Most of the postwar's Presidents of the Fifth Republic wanted to leave their own monuments in Paris; President Georges Pompidou started the Centre Georges Pompidou (1977), Valéry Giscard d'Estaing began the Musée d'Orsay (1986); President François Mitterrand, in power for 14 years, built the Opéra Bastille (1985–1989), the new site of the Bibliothèque nationale de France (1996), the Arche de la Défense (1985–1989), and the Louvre Pyramid with its underground courtyard (1983–1989); Jacques Chirac (2006), the Musée du quai Branly.[88] Western Paris in 2016, as photographed by a SkySat satellite. In the early 21st century, the population of Paris began to increase slowly again, as more young people moved into the city. It reached 2.25 million in 2011. In March 2001, Bertrand Delanoë became the first Socialist Mayor of Paris. In 2007, in an effort to reduce car traffic in the city, he introduced the Vélib', a system which rents bicycles for the use of local residents and visitors. Bertrand Delanoë also transformed a section of the highway along the Left Bank of the Seine into an urban promenade and park, the Promenade des Berges de la Seine, which he inaugurated in June 2013.[89] In 2007, President Nicolas Sarkozy launched the Grand Paris project, to integrate Paris more closely with the towns in the region around it. After many modifications, the new area, named the Metropolis of Grand Paris, with a population of 6.7 million, was created on 1 January 2016.[90] In 2011, the City of Paris and the national government approved the plans for the Grand Paris Express, totalling 205 kilometres (127 miles) of automated metro lines to connect Paris, the innermost three departments around Paris, airports and high-speed rail (TGV) stations, at an estimated cost of €35 billion.[91] The system is scheduled to be completed by 2030.[92] Terrorist attacks[edit] Further information: 1995 France bombings, Charlie Hebdo shooting, November 2015 Paris attacks, Louvre machete attack, March 2017 Île-de-France attacks, and April 2017 Champs-Élysées attack Anti-terrorism demonstration on the Place de la République after the Charlie Hebdo shooting, 11 January 2015 Between July and October 1995, a series of bombings carried out by the Armed Islamic Group of Algeria caused 8 deaths and more than 200 injuries.[93] On 7 January 2015, two French Muslim extremists attacked the Paris headquarters of Charlie Hebdo and killed thirteen people, in an attack claimed by Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula,[94] and on 9 January, a third terrorist, who claimed he was part of ISIL, killed four hostages during an attack at a Jewish grocery store at Porte de Vincennes.[95] On 11 January an estimated 1.5 million people marched in Paris in a show of solidarity against terrorism and in support of freedom of speech.[96] On 13 November of the same year, a series of coordinated bomb and gunfire terrorist attacks in Paris and Saint-Denis, claimed by ISIL,[97] killed 130 people and injured more than 350.[98] On 3 February 2017, a two-backpack-carrying, machete-wielding attacker shouting ""Allahu Akbar"" attacked soldiers guarding the Louvre museum after they stopped him because of his bags; the assailant was shot, and no explosives were found.[99] On 18 March of the same year, in a Vitry-sur-Seine bar, a man held patrons hostage, then fled to later hold a gun to the head of an Orly Airport French soldier, shouting ""I am here to die in the name of Allah"", and was shot dead by the soldier's comrades.[100] On 20 April, a man fatally shot a French police officer on the Champs-Élysées, and was later shot dead himself.[101] On 19 June, a man rammed his weapons-and-explosives-laden vehicle into a police van on the Champs-Élysées, but the car only burst into flames.[102] Geography[edit] Location[edit] Main article: Geography of Paris Satellite image of Paris by Sentinel-2 Paris in the night from a plane Paris is located in northern central France, in a north-bending arc of the river Seine whose crest includes two islands, the Île Saint-Louis and the larger Île de la Cité, which form the oldest part of the city. The river's mouth on the English Channel (La Manche) is about 233 mi (375 km) downstream from the city. The city is spread widely on both banks of the river.[103] Overall, the city is relatively flat, and the lowest point is 35 m (115 ft) above sea level. Paris has several prominent hills, the highest of which is Montmartre at 130 m (427 ft).[104] Excluding the outlying parks of Bois de Boulogne and Bois de Vincennes, Paris covers an oval measuring about 87 km2 (34 sq mi) in area, enclosed by the 35 km (22 mi) ring road, the Boulevard Périphérique.[105] The city's last major annexation of outlying territories in 1860 not only gave it its modern form but also created the 20 clockwise-spiralling arrondissements (municipal boroughs). From the 1860 area of 78 km2 (30 sq mi), the city limits were expanded marginally to 86.9 km2 (33.6 sq mi) in the 1920s. In 1929, the Bois de Boulogne and Bois de Vincennes forest parks were officially annexed to the city, bringing its area to about 105 km2 (41 sq mi).[106] The metropolitan area of the city is 2,300 km2 (890 sq mi).[103] Measured from the 'point zero' in front of its Notre-Dame cathedral, Paris by road is 450 kilometres (280 mi) southeast of London, 287 kilometres (178 mi) south of Calais, 305 kilometres (190 mi) southwest of Brussels, 774 kilometres (481 mi) north of Marseille, 385 kilometres (239 mi) northeast of Nantes, and 135 kilometres (84 mi) southeast of Rouen.[107] Climate[edit] Main article: Climate of Paris Autumn in Paris Paris has a typical Western European oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb), which is affected by the North Atlantic Current. The overall climate throughout the year is mild and moderately wet.[108] Summer days are usually warm and pleasant with average temperatures between 15 and 25 °C (59 and 77 °F), and a fair amount of sunshine.[109] Each year, however, there are a few days when the temperature rises above 32 °C (90 °F). Longer periods of more intense heat sometimes occur, such as the heat wave of 2003 when temperatures exceeded 30 °C (86 °F) for weeks, reached 40 °C (104 °F) on some days and rarely cooled down at night.[110] Spring and autumn have, on average, mild days and fresh nights but are changing and unstable. Surprisingly warm or cool weather occurs frequently in both seasons.[111] In winter, sunshine is scarce; days are cool, and nights are cold but generally above freezing with low temperatures around 3 °C (37 °F).[112] Light night frosts are however quite common, but the temperature seldom dips below −5 °C (23 °F). Snow falls every year, but rarely stays on the ground. The city sometimes sees light snow or flurries with or without accumulation.[113] Paris has an average annual precipitation of 641 mm (25.2 in), and experiences light rainfall distributed evenly throughout the year. However, the city is known for intermittent, abrupt, heavy showers. The highest recorded temperature was 42.6 °C (108.7 °F) on 25 July 2019,[114] and the lowest was −23.9 °C (−11.0 °F) on 10 December 1879.[115] Climate data for Paris (Parc Montsouris), elevation: 75 m (246 ft), 1981–2010 normals, extremes 1872–present Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °C (°F) 16.1(61.0) 21.4(70.5) 26.0(78.8) 30.2(86.4) 34.8(94.6) 37.6(99.7) 42.6(108.7) 39.5(103.1) 36.2(97.2) 28.9(84.0) 21.6(70.9) 17.1(62.8) 42.6(108.7) Average high °C (°F) 7.2(45.0) 8.3(46.9) 12.2(54.0) 15.6(60.1) 19.6(67.3) 22.7(72.9) 25.2(77.4) 25.0(77.0) 21.1(70.0) 16.3(61.3) 10.8(51.4) 7.5(45.5) 16.0(60.8) Daily mean °C (°F) 4.9(40.8) 5.6(42.1) 8.8(47.8) 11.5(52.7) 15.2(59.4) 18.3(64.9) 20.5(68.9) 20.3(68.5) 16.9(62.4) 13.0(55.4) 8.3(46.9) 5.5(41.9) 12.4(54.3) Average low °C (°F) 2.7(36.9) 2.8(37.0) 5.3(41.5) 7.3(45.1) 10.9(51.6) 13.8(56.8) 15.8(60.4) 15.7(60.3) 12.7(54.9) 9.6(49.3) 5.8(42.4) 3.4(38.1) 8.8(47.8) Record low °C (°F) −14.6(5.7) −14.7(5.5) −9.1(15.6) −3.5(25.7) −0.1(31.8) 3.1(37.6) 2.7(36.9) 6.3(43.3) 1.8(35.2) −3.8(25.2) −14.0(6.8) −23.9(−11.0) −23.9(−11.0) Average precipitation mm (inches) 51.0(2.01) 41.2(1.62) 47.6(1.87) 51.8(2.04) 63.2(2.49) 49.6(1.95) 62.3(2.45) 52.7(2.07) 47.6(1.87) 61.5(2.42) 51.1(2.01) 57.8(2.28) 637.4(25.09) Average precipitation days (≥ 1.0 mm) 9.9 9.0 10.6 9.3 9.8 8.4 8.1 7.7 7.8 9.6 10.0 10.9 111.1 Average snowy days 3.0 3.9 1.6 0.6 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.7 2.1 11.9 Average relative humidity (%) 83 78 73 69 70 69 68 71 76 82 84 84 76 Mean monthly sunshine hours 62.5 79.2 128.9 166.0 193.8 202.1 212.2 212.1 167.9 117.8 67.7 51.4 1,661.6 Percent possible sunshine 22 28 35 39 42 42 43 49 43 35 26 21 35 Average ultraviolet index 1 2 3 4 6 7 7 6 4 3 1 1 4 Source 1: Meteo France,[116][117] Infoclimat.fr (relative humidity 1961–1990)[118] Source 2: Weather Atlas (percent sunshine and UV Index)[119] Administration[edit] Main article: Administration of Paris City government[edit] See also: Arrondissements of Paris and List of mayors of Paris A map of the arrondissements of Paris For almost all of its long history, except for a few brief periods, Paris was governed directly by representatives of the king, emperor, or president of France. The city was not granted municipal autonomy by the National Assembly until 1974.[120] The first modern elected mayor of Paris was Jacques Chirac, elected 20 March 1977, becoming the city's first mayor since 1793. The mayor is Anne Hidalgo, a socialist, first elected 5 April 2014[121] and re-elected 28 June 2020.[122] The mayor of Paris is elected indirectly by Paris voters; the voters of each of the city's 20 arrondissements elect members to the Conseil de Paris (Council of Paris), which subsequently elects the mayor. The council is composed of 163 members, with each arrondissement allocated a number of seats dependent upon its population, from 10 members for each of the least-populated arrondissements (1st through 9th) to 34 members for the most populated (the 15th). The council is elected using closed list proportional representation in a two-round system.[123] Party lists winning an absolute majority in the first round – or at least a plurality in the second round – automatically win half the seats of an arrondissement.[123] The remaining half of seats are distributed proportionally to all lists which win at least 5% of the vote using the highest averages method.[124] This ensures that the winning party or coalition always wins a majority of the seats, even if they don't win an absolute majority of the vote.[123] The Hôtel de Ville, or city hall, has been at the same site since 1357. Once elected, the council plays a largely passive role in the city government, primarily because it meets only once a month. The council is divided between a coalition of the left of 91 members, including the socialists, communists, greens, and extreme left; and 71 members for the centre-right, plus a few members from smaller parties.[125] Each of Paris' 20 arrondissements has its own town hall and a directly elected council (conseil d'arrondissement), which, in turn, elects an arrondissement mayor.[126] The council of each arrondissement is composed of members of the Conseil de Paris and also members who serve only on the council of the arrondissement. The number of deputy mayors in each arrondissement varies depending upon its population. There are a total of 20 arrondissement mayors and 120 deputy mayors.[120] The budget of the city for 2018 is 9.5 billion Euros, with an expected deficit of 5.5 billion Euros. 7.9 billion Euros are designated for city administration, and 1.7 billion Euros for investment. The number of city employees increased from 40,000 in 2001 to 55,000 in 2018. The largest part of the investment budget is earmarked for public housing (262 million Euros) and for real estate (142 million Euros).[127] Métropole du Grand Paris[edit] A map of the Greater Paris Metropolis (Métropole du Grand Paris) and its governing territories. The Métropole du Grand Paris, or simply Grand Paris, formally came into existence on 1 January 2016.[128] It is an administrative structure for co-operation between the City of Paris and its nearest suburbs. It includes the City of Paris, plus the communes of the three departments of the inner suburbs (Hauts-de-Seine, Seine-Saint-Denis and Val-de-Marne), plus seven communes in the outer suburbs, including Argenteuil in Val d'Oise and Paray-Vieille-Poste in Essonne, which were added to include the major airports of Paris. The Metropole covers 814 square kilometres (314 square miles) and has a population of 6.945 million persons.[129][130] The new structure is administered by a Metropolitan Council of 210 members, not directly elected, but chosen by the councils of the member Communes. By 2020 its basic competencies will include urban planning, housing and protection of the environment.[128][130] The first president of the metropolitan council, Patrick Ollier, a Republican and the mayor of the town of Rueil-Malmaison, was elected on 22 January 2016. Though the Metropole has a population of nearly seven million people and accounts for 25 percent of the GDP of France, it has a very small budget: just 65 million Euros, compared with eight billion Euros for the City of Paris.[131] Regional government[edit] The Region of Île de France, including Paris and its surrounding communities, is governed by the Regional Council, which has its headquarters in the 7th arrondissement of Paris. It is composed of 209 members representing the different communes within the region. On 15 December 2015, a list of candidates of the Union of the Right, a coalition of centrist and right-wing parties, led by Valérie Pécresse, narrowly won the regional election, defeating a coalition of Socialists and ecologists. The Socialists had governed the region for seventeen years. The regional council has 121 members from the Union of the Right, 66 from the Union of the Left and 22 from the extreme right National Front.[132] National government[edit] The Élysée Palace, official residence of the President of the French Republic As the capital of France, Paris is the seat of France's national government. For the executive, the two chief officers each have their own official residences, which also serve as their offices. The President of the French Republic resides at the Élysée Palace in the 8th arrondissement,[133] while the Prime Minister's seat is at the Hôtel Matignon in the 7th arrondissement.[134][135] Government ministries are located in various parts of the city; many are located in the 7th arrondissement, near the Hôtel Matignon.[136] Both houses of the French Parliament are located on the Rive Gauche. The upper house, the Senate, meets in the Palais du Luxembourg in the 6th arrondissement, while the more important lower house, the National Assembly, meets in the Palais Bourbon in the 7th arrondissement. The President of the Senate, the second-highest public official in France (the President of the Republic being the sole superior), resides in the Petit Luxembourg, a smaller palace annexe to the Palais du Luxembourg.[137] The Palais-Royal, residence of the Conseil d'État Members of the National Assembly for Paris (elected in 2017) Constituency Member[138] Party Paris' 1st constituency Sylvain Maillard La République En Marche!

The Court of Cassation, the highest court in the judicial order, which reviews criminal and civil cases, is located in the Palais de Justice on the Île de la Cité,[139] while the Conseil d'État, which provides legal advice to the executive and acts as the highest court in the administrative order, judging litigation against public bodies, is located in the Palais-Royal in the 1st arrondissement.[140] The Constitutional Council, an advisory body with ultimate authority on the constitutionality of laws and government decrees, also meets in the Montpensier wing of the Palais Royal.[141] Paris and its region host the headquarters of several international organisations including UNESCO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the International Chamber of Commerce, the Paris Club, the European Space Agency, the International Energy Agency, the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie, the European Union Institute for Security Studies, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, the International Exhibition Bureau, and the International Federation for Human Rights. Following the motto ""Only Paris is worthy of Rome; only Rome is worthy of Paris"";[142] the only sister city of Paris is Rome, although Paris has partnership agreements with many other cities around the world.[142] Police force[edit] Police (Gendarmerie) motorcyclists in Paris The security of Paris is mainly the responsibility of the Prefecture of Police of Paris, a subdivision of the Ministry of the Interior. It supervises the units of the National Police who patrol the city and the three neighbouring departments. It is also responsible for providing emergency services, including the Paris Fire Brigade. Its headquarters is on Place Louis Lépine on the Île de la Cité.[143] There are 30,200 officers under the prefecture, and a fleet of more than 6,000 vehicles, including police cars, motorcycles, fire trucks, boats and helicopters.[143] The national police has its own special unit for riot control and crowd control and security of public buildings, called the Compagnies Républicaines de Sécurité (CRS), a unit formed in 1944 right after the liberation of France. Vans of CRS agents are frequently seen in the centre of the city when there are demonstrations and public events. The police are supported by the National Gendarmerie, a branch of the French Armed Forces, though their police operations now are supervised by the Ministry of the Interior. The traditional kepis of the gendarmes were replaced in 2002 with caps, and the force modernised, though they still wear kepis for ceremonial occasions.[144] Crime in Paris is similar to that in most large cities. Violent crime is relatively rare in the city centre. Political violence is uncommon, though very large demonstrations may occur in Paris and other French cities simultaneously. These demonstrations, usually managed by a strong police presence, can turn confrontational and escalate into violence.[145] Cityscape[edit] Panorama of Paris as seen from the Eiffel Tower in a full 360-degree view (river flowing from north-east to south-west, right to left) Urbanism and architecture[edit] See also: Architecture of Paris, Haussmann's renovation of Paris, Religious buildings in Paris, and List of tallest buildings and structures in the Paris region Most French rulers since the Middle Ages made a point of leaving their mark on a city that, contrary to many other of the world's capitals, has never been destroyed by catastrophe or war. In modernising its infrastructure through the centuries, Paris has preserved even its earliest history in its street map.[146] At its origin, before the Middle Ages, the city was composed of several islands and sandbanks in a bend of the Seine; of those, two remain today: Île Saint-Louis and the Île de la Cité. A third one is the 1827 artificially created Île aux Cygnes. Camille Pissarro, Boulevard Montmartre, 1897, Hermitage Museum Modern Paris owes much of its downtown plan and architectural harmony to Napoleon III and his Prefect of the Seine, Baron Haussmann. Between 1853 and 1870 they rebuilt the city centre, created the wide downtown boulevards and squares where the boulevards intersected, imposed standard facades along the boulevards, and required that the facades be built of the distinctive cream-grey ""Paris stone"". They also built the major parks around the city centre.[147] The high residential population of its city centre also makes it much different from most other western major cities.[148] Rue de Rivoli Place des Vosges Paris' urbanism laws have been under strict control since the early 17th century,[149] particularly where street-front alignment, building height and building distribution is concerned. In recent developments, a 1974–2010 building height limitation of 37 metres (121 ft) was raised to 50 m (160 ft) in central areas and 180 metres (590 ft) in some of Paris' peripheral quarters, yet for some of the city's more central quarters, even older building-height laws still remain in effect.[149] The 210 metres (690 ft) Tour Montparnasse was both Paris's and France's tallest building since 1973,[150] but this record has been held by the La Défense quarter Tour First tower in Courbevoie since its 2011 construction. Parisian examples of historical architectural styles date back more than a millennium, including the Romanesque church of the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés (1014–1163), the early Gothic Architecture of the Basilica of Saint-Denis (1144), the Notre Dame Cathedral (1163–1345), the Flamboyant Gothic of Saint Chapelle (1239–1248), the Baroque churches of Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis (1627–1641) and Les Invalides (1670–1708). The 19th century produced the neoclassical church of La Madeleine (1808–1842), the Palais Garnier serving as an opera house (1875), the neo-Byzantine Basilica of Sacré-Cœur (1875–1919), as well as the exuberant Belle Époque modernism of the Eiffel Tower (1889). Striking examples of 20th-century architecture include the Centre Georges Pompidou by Richard Rogers and Renzo Piano (1977), the Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie by various architects (1986), the Arab World Institute by Jean Nouvel (1987), the Louvre Pyramid by I. M. Pei (1989) and the Opéra Bastille by Carlos Ott (1989). Contemporary architecture includes the Musée du quai Branly – Jacques Chirac by Jean Nouvel (2006), the contemporary art museum of the Louis Vuitton Foundation by Frank Gehry (2014)[151] and the new Tribunal de grande instance de Paris by Renzo Piano (2018). Housing[edit] The most expensive residential streets in Paris in 2018 by average price per square metre were Avenue Montaigne (8th arrondissement), at 22,372 euros per square metre; Place Dauphine (1st arrondissement; 20,373 euros) and the Rue de Furstemberg (6th arrondissement) at 18,839 euros per square metre.[152] The total number of residences in the City of Paris in 2011 was 1,356,074, up from a former high of 1,334,815 in 2006. Among these, 1,165,541 (85.9 percent) were main residences, 91,835 (6.8 percent) were secondary residences, and the remaining 7.3 percent were empty (down from 9.2 percent in 2006).[153] Sixty-two percent of its buildings date from 1949 and before, 20 percent were built between 1949 and 1974, and only 18 percent of the buildings remaining were built after that date.[154] Two-thirds of the city's 1.3 million residences are studio and two-room apartments. Paris averages 1.9 people per residence, a number that has remained constant since the 1980s, but it is much less than Île-de-France's 2.33 person-per-residence average. Only 33 percent of principal residence Parisians own their habitation (against 47 percent for the entire Île-de-France): the major part of the city's population is a rent-paying one.[154] Social or public housing represented 19.9 percent of the city's total residences in 2017. Its distribution varies widely throughout the city, from 2.6 percent of the housing in the wealthy 7th arrondissement, to 24 percent in the 20th arrondissement, 26 percent in the 14th arrondissement and 39.9 percent in the 19th arrondissement, on the poorer southwest and northern edges of the city.[155] On the night of 8–9 February 2019, during a period of cold weather, a Paris NGO conducted its annual citywide count of homeless persons. They counted 3,641 homeless persons in Paris, of whom twelve percent were women. More than half had been homeless for more than a year. 2,885 were living in the streets or parks, 298 in train and metro stations, and 756 in other forms of temporary shelter. This was an increase of 588 persons since 2018.[156] Paris and its suburbs[edit] Paris and its suburbs, as seen from the Spot Satellite West of Paris seen from Tour Montparnasse in 2019 Aside from the 20th-century addition of the Bois de Boulogne, the Bois de Vincennes and the Paris heliport, Paris's administrative limits have remained unchanged since 1860. A greater administrative Seine department had been governing Paris and its suburbs since its creation in 1790, but the rising suburban population had made it difficult to maintain as a unique entity. To address this problem, the parent ""District de la région parisienne"" ('district of the Paris region') was reorganised into several new departments from 1968: Paris became a department in itself, and the administration of its suburbs was divided between the three new departments surrounding it. The district of the Paris region was renamed ""Île-de-France"" in 1977, but this abbreviated ""Paris region"" name is still commonly used today to describe the Île-de-France, and as a vague reference to the entire Paris agglomeration.[157] Long-intended measures to unite Paris with its suburbs began on 1 January 2016, when the Métropole du Grand Paris came into existence.[128] Paris' disconnect with its suburbs, its lack of suburban transportation, in particular, became all too apparent with the Paris agglomeration's growth. Paul Delouvrier promised to resolve the Paris-suburbs mésentente when he became head of the Paris region in 1961:[158] two of his most ambitious projects for the Region were the construction of five suburban ""villes nouvelles"" (""new cities"")[159] and the RER commuter train network.[160] Many other suburban residential districts (grands ensembles) were built between the 1960s and 1970s to provide a low-cost solution for a rapidly expanding population:[161] These districts were socially mixed at first,[162] but few residents actually owned their homes (the growing economy made these accessible to the middle classes only from the 1970s).[163] Their poor construction quality and their haphazard insertion into existing urban growth contributed to their desertion by those able to move elsewhere and their repopulation by those with more limited possibilities.[163] These areas, quartiers sensibles (""sensitive quarters""), are in northern and eastern Paris, namely around its Goutte d'Or and Belleville neighbourhoods. To the north of the city, they are grouped mainly in the Seine-Saint-Denis department, and to a lesser extreme to the east in the Val-d'Oise department. Other difficult areas are located in the Seine valley, in Évry et Corbeil-Essonnes (Essonne), in Mureaux, Mantes-la-Jolie (Yvelines), and scattered among social housing districts created by Delouvrier's 1961 ""ville nouvelle"" political initiative.[164] The Paris agglomeration's urban sociology is basically that of 19th-century Paris: its fortuned classes are situated in its west and southwest, and its middle-to-lower classes are in its north and east. The remaining areas are mostly middle-class citizenry dotted with islands of fortuned populations located there due to reasons of historical importance, namely Saint-Maur-des-Fossés to the east and Enghien-les-Bains to the north of Paris.[165] Demographics[edit] Main article: Demographics of Paris 2015 Census Paris Region[166][167] Country/territory of birth Population Metropolitan France 9,165,570 Algeria 310,019 Portugal 243,490 Morocco 241,403 Tunisia 117,161 Guadeloupe 80,062 Martinique 77,300 Turkey 69,835 China 67,540 Mali 60,438 Italy 56,692 Côte d'Ivoire 55,022 Senegal 52,758 Romania 49,124 Democratic Republic of Congo 47,091 Spain 47,058 Other countries/territories Sri Lanka 42,016 Cameroon 41,749 Poland 38,550 Republic of the Congo 36,354 Haiti 35,855 Vietnam 35,139 Cambodia 31,258 Réunion 28,869 India 26,507 Serbia 26,119 Germany 21,620 Lebanon 20,375 Mauritius 19,506 Madagascar 19,281 Pakistan 18,801 United Kingdom 18,209 Russia 18,022 United States 17,548 Other countries and territories 846,914 The official estimated population of the City of Paris was 2,206,488 as of 1 January 2019[update], according to the INSEE, the official French statistical agency. This is a decline of 59,648 from 2015, close to the total population of the 5th arrondissement.[168] Despite the drop, Paris remains the most densely-populated city in Europe, with 252 residents per hectare, not counting parks.[168] This drop was attributed partly to a lower birth rate, to the departure of middle-class residents. and partly to the possible loss of housing in the city due to short-term rentals for tourism.[169] Paris is the fourth largest municipality in the European Union, following Berlin, Madrid and Rome. Eurostat places Paris (6.5 million people) behind London (8 million) and ahead of Berlin (3.5 million), based on the 2012 populations of what Eurostat calls ""urban audit core cities"".[170] City proper, urban area, and metropolitan area population from 1800 to 2010 The population of Paris today is lower than its historical peak of 2.9 million in 1921.[171] The principal reasons were a significant decline in household size, and a dramatic migration of residents to the suburbs between 1962 and 1975. Factors in the migration included de-industrialisation, high rent, the gentrification of many inner quarters, the transformation of living space into offices, and greater affluence among working families. The city's population loss came to a temporary halt at the beginning of the 21st century; the population increased from 2,125,246 in 1999 to 2,240,621 in 2012, before declining again slightly in 2017.[172] It declined again in 2018. Paris is the core of a built-up area that extends well beyond its limits: commonly referred to as the agglomération Parisienne, and statistically as a unité urbaine (a measure of urban area), the Paris agglomeration's 2017 population of 10,784,830[173] made it the largest urban area in the European Union.[174] City-influenced commuter activity reaches well beyond even this in a statistical aire urbaine de Paris (""urban area"", but a statistical method comparable to a metropolitan area[175]), that had a 2017 population of 12,628,266,[176] a number 19% the population of France,[177] and the largest metropolitan area in the Eurozone.[174] According to Eurostat, the EU statistical agency, in 2012 the Commune of Paris was the most densely populated city in the European Union, with 21,616 people per square kilometre within the city limits (the NUTS-3 statistical area), ahead of Inner London West, which had 10,374 people per square kilometre. According to the same census, three departments bordering Paris, Hauts-de-Seine, Seine-Saint-Denis and Val-de-Marne, had population densities of over 10,000 people per square kilometre, ranking among the 10 most densely populated areas of the EU.[178][verification needed] Migration[edit] According to the 2012 French census, 586,163 residents of the City of Paris, or 26.2 percent, and 2,782,834 residents of the Paris Region (Île-de-France), or 23.4 percent, were born outside of metropolitan France (the last figure up from 22.4% at the 2007 census).[166] 26,700 of these in the City of Paris and 210,159 in the Paris Region were people born in Overseas France (more than two-thirds of whom in the French West Indies) and are therefore not counted as immigrants since they were legally French citizens at birth.[166] A further 103,648 in the City of Paris and in 412,114 in the Paris Region were born in foreign countries with French citizenship at birth.[166] This concerns in particular the many Christians and Jews from North Africa who moved to France and Paris after the times of independence and are not counted as immigrants due to their being born French citizens. The remaining group, people born in foreign countries with no French citizenship at birth, are those defined as immigrants under French law. According to the 2012 census, 135,853 residents of the City of Paris were immigrants from Europe, 112,369 were immigrants from the Maghreb, 70,852 from sub-Saharan Africa and Egypt, 5,059 from Turkey, 91,297 from Asia (outside Turkey), 38,858 from the Americas, and 1,365 from the South Pacific.[179] Note that the immigrants from the Americas and the South Pacific in Paris are vastly outnumbered by migrants from French overseas regions and territories located in these regions of the world.[166] In the Paris Region, 590,504 residents were immigrants from Europe, 627,078 were immigrants from the Maghreb, 435,339 from sub-Saharan Africa and Egypt, 69,338 from Turkey, 322,330 from Asia (outside Turkey), 113,363 from the Americas, and 2,261 from the South Pacific.[180] These last two groups of immigrants are again vastly outnumbered by migrants from French overseas regions and territories located in the Americas and the South Pacific.[166][clarification needed] In 2012, there were 8,810 British citizens and 10,019 United States citizens living in the City of Paris (Ville de Paris) and 20,466 British citizens and 16,408 United States citizens living in the entire Paris Region (Île-de-France).[181][182] Religion[edit] See also: Religious buildings in Paris Sacré-Cœur in Montmartre St-Gervais-et-St-Protais in Le Marais At the beginning of the twentieth century, Paris was the largest Catholic city in the world.[183] French census data does not contain information about religious affiliation.[184] According to a 2011 survey by the Institut français d'opinion publique (IFOP), a French public opinion research organisation, 61 percent of residents of the Paris Region (Île-de-France) identified themselves as Roman Catholic. In the same survey, 7 percent of residents identified themselves as Muslims, 4 percent as Protestants, 2 percent as Jewish and 25 percent as without religion. According to the INSEE, between 4 and 5 million French residents were born or had at least one parent born in a predominantly Muslim country, particularly Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia. An IFOP survey in 2008 reported that, of immigrants from these predominantly Muslim countries, 25 percent went to the mosque regularly; 41 percent practised the religion, and 34 percent were believers but did not practice the religion.[185][186] In 2012 and 2013, it was estimated that there were almost 500,000 Muslims in the City of Paris, 1.5 million Muslims in the Île-de-France region and 4 to 5 million Muslims in France.[187][188] The Jewish population of the Paris Region was estimated in 2014 to be 282,000, the largest concentration of Jews in the world outside of Israel and the United States.[189] International organisations[edit] The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has had its headquarters in Paris since November 1958. Paris is also the home of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).[190] Paris hosts the headquarters of the European Space Agency, the International Energy Agency, European Securities and Markets Authority and, as of 2019[update], the European Banking Authority. Economy[edit] Main article: Economy of Paris La Défense, the largest dedicated business district in Europe[191] Companies with world headquartersin the Paris Region ranked by revenue(2018) Parisranking Corporation Worldranking 1 AXA 27 2 Total S.A. 28 3 BNP Paribas 44 4 Carrefour 68 5 Crédit Agricole 82 6 EDF 94 7 Engie 104 8 Peugeot 108 9 Société Générale 121 10 Renault 134 Source: Fortune Global 500 (2018) The Eiffel Tower and the La Défense district The economy of the City of Paris is based largely on services and commerce; of the 390,480 enterprises in the city, 80.6 percent are engaged in commerce, transportation, and diverse services, 6.5 percent in construction, and just 3.8 percent in industry.[192] The story is similar in the Paris Region (Île-de-France): 76.7 percent of enterprises are engaged in commerce and services, and 3.4 percent in industry.[193] At the 2012 census, 59.5% of jobs in the Paris Region were in market services (12.0% in wholesale and retail trade, 9.7% in professional, scientific, and technical services, 6.5% in information and communication, 6.5% in transportation and warehousing, 5.9% in finance and insurance, 5.8% in administrative and support services, 4.6% in accommodation and food services, and 8.5% in various other market services), 26.9% in non-market services (10.4% in human health and social work activities, 9.6% in public administration and defence, and 6.9% in education), 8.2% in manufacturing and utilities (6.6% in manufacturing and 1.5% in utilities), 5.2% in construction, and 0.2% in agriculture.[194][195] The Paris Region had 5.4 million salaried employees in 2010, of whom 2.2 million were concentrated in 39 pôles d'emplois or business districts. The largest of these, in terms of number of employees, is known in French as the QCA, or quartier central des affaires; it is in the western part of the City of Paris, in the 2nd, 8th, 9th, 16th, and 18th arrondissements. In 2010, it was the workplace of 500,000 salaried employees, about 30 percent of the salaried employees in Paris and 10 percent of those in the Île-de-France. The largest sectors of activity in the central business district were finance and insurance (16 percent of employees in the district) and business services (15 percent). The district also includes a large concentration of department stores, shopping areas, hotels and restaurants, as well a government offices and ministries.[196] The second-largest business district in terms of employment is La Défense, just west of the city, where many companies installed their offices in the 1990s. In 2010, it was the workplace of 144,600 employees, of whom 38 percent worked in finance and insurance, 16 percent in business support services. Two other important districts, Neuilly-sur-Seine and Levallois-Perret, are extensions of the Paris business district and of La Défense. Another district, including Boulogne-Billancourt, Issy-les-Moulineaux and the southern part of the 15th arrondissement, is a centre of activity for the media and information technology.[196] The top ten French companies listed in the Fortune Global 500 for 2018 all have their headquarters in the Paris Region; six in the central business district of the City of Paris; and four close to the city in the Hauts-de-Seine Department, three in La Défense and one in Boulogne-Billancourt. Some companies, like Société Générale, have offices in both Paris and La Défense. The Paris Region is France's leading region for economic activity, with a GDP of €681 billion (~US$850 billion) and €56,000 (~US$70,000) per capita.[6] In 2011, its GDP ranked second among the regions of Europe and its per-capita GDP was the 4th highest in Europe.[197][198] While the Paris region's population accounted for 18.8 percent of metropolitan France in 2011,[199] the Paris region's GDP accounted for 30 percent of metropolitan France's GDP.[200] The Paris Region economy has gradually shifted from industry to high-value-added service industries (finance, IT services) and high-tech manufacturing (electronics, optics, aerospace, etc.).[201] The Paris region's most intense economic activity through the central Hauts-de-Seine department and suburban La Défense business district places Paris' economic centre to the west of the city, in a triangle between the Opéra Garnier, La Défense and the Val de Seine.[201] While the Paris economy is dominated by services, and employment in manufacturing sector has declined sharply, the region remains an important manufacturing centre, particularly for aeronautics, automobiles, and ""eco"" industries.[201] In the 2017 worldwide cost of living survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, based on a survey made in September 2016, Paris ranked as the seventh most expensive city in the world, and the second most expensive in Europe, after Zurich.[202] In 2018, Paris was the most expensive city in the world with Singapore and Hong Kong.[203] Station F is a business incubator for startups, located in 13th arrondissement of Paris. Noted as the world's largest startup facility.[204] Employment[edit] Employment by economic sector in the Paris area (petite couronne), with population and unemployment figures (2015) According to 2015 INSEE figures, 68.3 percent of employees in the City of Paris work in commerce, transportation, and services; 24.5 percent in public administration, health and social services; 4.1 percent in industry, and 0.1 percent in agriculture.[205] The majority of Paris' salaried employees fill 370,000 businesses services jobs, concentrated in the north-western 8th, 16th and 17th arrondissements.[206] Paris' financial service companies are concentrated in the central-western 8th and 9th arrondissement banking and insurance district.[206] Paris' department store district in the 1st, 6th, 8th and 9th arrondissements employ ten percent of mostly female Paris workers, with 100,000 of these registered in the retail trade.[206] Fourteen percent of Parisians work in hotels and restaurants and other services to individuals.[206] Nineteen percent of Paris employees work for the State in either administration or education. The majority of Paris' healthcare and social workers work at the hospitals and social housing concentrated in the peripheral 13th, 14th, 18th, 19th and 20th arrondissements.[206] Outside Paris, the western Hauts-de-Seine department La Défense district specialising in finance, insurance and scientific research district, employs 144,600,[201] and the north-eastern Seine-Saint-Denis audiovisual sector has 200 media firms and 10 major film studios.[201] Paris' manufacturing is mostly focused in its suburbs, and the city itself has only around 75,000 manufacturing workers, most of which are in the textile, clothing, leather goods, and shoe trades.[201] Paris region manufacturing specialises in transportation, mainly automobiles, aircraft and trains, but this is in a sharp decline: Paris proper manufacturing jobs dropped by 64 percent between 1990 and 2010, and the Paris region lost 48 percent during the same period. Most of this is due to companies relocating outside the Paris region. The Paris region's 800 aerospace companies employed 100,000.[201] Four hundred automobile industry companies employ another 100,000 workers: many of these are centred in the Yvelines department around the Renault and PSA-Citroen plants (this department alone employs 33,000),[201] but the industry as a whole suffered a major loss with the 2014 closing of a major Aulnay-sous-Bois Citroen assembly plant.[201] The southern Essonne department specialises in science and technology,[201] and the south-eastern Val-de-Marne, with its wholesale Rungis food market, specialises in food processing and beverages.[201] The Paris region's manufacturing decline is quickly being replaced by eco-industries: these employ about 100,000 workers.[201] In 2011, while only 56,927 construction workers worked in Paris itself,[207] its metropolitan area employed 246,639,[205] in an activity centred largely on the Seine-Saint-Denis (41,378)[208] and Hauts-de-Seine (37,303)[209] departments and the new business-park centres appearing there. Unemployment[edit] Paris' 2015 at-census unemployment rate was 12.2%,[205] and in the first trimester of 2018, its ILO-critera unemployment rate was 7.1 percent. The provisional unemployment rate in the whole Paris Region was higher: 8.0 percent, and considerably higher in some suburbs, notably the Department of Seine-Saint-Denis to the east (11.8 percent) and the Val-d'Oise to the north (8.2 percent).[210] Incomes[edit] Median income in Paris and its nearest departments The average net household income (after social, pension and health insurance contributions) in Paris was €36,085 for 2011.[211] It ranged from €22,095 in the 19th arrondissement[212] to €82,449 in the 7th arrondissement.[213] The median taxable income for 2011 was around €25,000 in Paris and €22,200 for Île-de-France.[214] Generally speaking, incomes are higher in the Western part of the city and in the western suburbs than in the northern and eastern parts of the urban area.[215] Unemployment was estimated at 8.2 percent in the City of Paris and 8.8 percent in the Île-de-France region in the first trimester of 2015. It ranged from 7.6 percent in the wealthy Essonne department to 13.1 percent in the Seine-Saint-Denis department, where many recent immigrants live.[216] While Paris has some of the richest neighbourhoods in France, it also has some of the poorest, mostly on the eastern side of the city. In 2012, 14 percent of households in the city earned less than €977 per month, the official poverty line. Twenty-five percent of residents in the 19th arrondissement lived below the poverty line; 24 percent in the 18th, 22 percent in the 20th and 18 percent in the 10th. In the city's wealthiest neighbourhood, the 7th arrondissement, 7 percent lived below the poverty line; 8 percent in the 6th arrondissement; and 9 percent in the 16th arrondissement.[217] Tourism[edit] Main article: Tourism in Paris Tourists from around the world make the Louvre the most-visited art museum in the world. Greater Paris, comprising Paris and its three surrounding departments, received 38 million visitors in 2019, a record, measured by hotel arrivals.[17] These included 12.2 million French visitors. Of foreign visitors, the greatest number came from the United States (2.6 million), United Kingdom (1.2 million), Germany (981 thousand) and China (711 thousand).[17] However, tourism to Paris and its region fell to 17.5 million in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with a 78 percent drop in foreign tourists measured by hotel stays, and a drop of 56 percent in French guests, for an overall drop of 68 percent. This caused a drop 15 billion Euros in hotel receipts.[218] In 2018, measured by the Euromonitor Global Cities Destination Index, Paris was the second-busiest airline destination in the world, with 19.10 million visitors, behind Bangkok (22.78 million) but ahead of London (19.09 million).[219] According to the Paris Convention and Visitors Bureau, 393,008 workers in Greater Paris, or 12.4% of the total workforce, are engaged in tourism-related sectors such as hotels, catering, transport and leisure.[220] Monuments and attractions[edit] Main articles: Landmarks in Paris, Historical quarters of Paris, and List of tourist attractions in Paris See also: List of most visited museums The Passage Jouffroy, one of Paris's covered passages The city's top cultural attraction in 2019 was the Basilica of Sacré-Cœur (11 million visitors), followed by the Louvre (9.6 million visitors); the Eiffel Tower (6.1 million visitors); the Centre Pompidou (3.5 million visitors); and the Musée d'Orsay (3.3 million visitors).[17] Paris, Banks of the SeineUNESCO World Heritage SiteCriteriaCultural: i, ii, ivReference600Inscription1991 (15th Session)Area365 ha The centre of Paris contains the most visited monuments in the city, including the Notre Dame Cathedral (now closed for restoration) and the Louvre as well as the Sainte-Chapelle; Les Invalides, where the tomb of Napoleon is located, and the Eiffel Tower are located on the Left Bank south-west of the centre. The Panthéon and the Catacombs of Paris are also located on the Left Bank of the Seine. The banks of the Seine from the Pont de Sully to the Pont d'Iéna have been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1991.[221] The Axe historique, pictured here from Concorde to Grande Arche of La Défense Other landmarks are laid out east to west along the historical axis of Paris, which runs from the Louvre through the Tuileries Garden, the Luxor Column in the Place de la Concorde, and the Arc de Triomphe, to the Grande Arche of La Défense. The Eiffel Tower is one of the most visited monuments in the World Several other much-visited landmarks are located in the suburbs of the city; the Basilica of St Denis, in Seine-Saint-Denis, is the birthplace of the Gothic style of architecture and the royal necropolis of French kings and queens.[222] The Paris region hosts three other UNESCO Heritage sites: the Palace of Versailles in the west,[223] the Palace of Fontainebleau in the south,[224] and the medieval fairs site of Provins in the east.[225] In the Paris region, Disneyland Paris, in Marne-la-Vallée, 32 kilometres (20 miles) east of the centre of Paris, received 9.66 million visitors in 2017.[226] Hotels[edit] In 2019 Greater Paris had 2,056 hotels, including 94 five-star hotels, with a total of 121,646 rooms.[17] Paris has long been famous for its grand hotels. The Hotel Meurice, opened for British travellers in 1817, was one of the first luxury hotels in Paris.[227] The arrival of the railways and the Paris Exposition of 1855 brought the first flood of tourists and the first modern grand hotels; the Hôtel du Louvre (now an antiques marketplace) in 1855; the Grand Hotel (now the InterContinental Paris Le Grand Hotel) in 1862; and the Hôtel Continental in 1878. The Hôtel Ritz on Place Vendôme opened in 1898, followed by the Hôtel Crillon in an 18th-century building on the Place de la Concorde in 1909; the Hotel Bristol on the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré in 1925; and the Hotel George V in 1928.[228] In addition to hotels, in 2019 Greater Paris had 60,000 homes registered with Airbnb.[17] Under French law, renters of these units must pay the Paris tourism tax. The company paid the city government 7.3 million euros in 2016.[229] Culture[edit] Painting and sculpture[edit] Main article: Art in Paris Pierre Mignard, Self-portrait, between 1670 and 1690, oil on canvas, 235 cm × 188 cm (93 in × 74 in), The Louvre For centuries, Paris has attracted artists from around the world, who arrive in the city to educate themselves and to seek inspiration from its vast pool of artistic resources and galleries. As a result, Paris has acquired a reputation as the ""City of Art"".[230] Italian artists were a profound influence on the development of art in Paris in the 16th and 17th centuries, particularly in sculpture and reliefs. Painting and sculpture became the pride of the French monarchy and the French royal family commissioned many Parisian artists to adorn their palaces during the French Baroque and Classicism era. Sculptors such as Girardon, Coysevox and Coustou acquired reputations as the finest artists in the royal court in 17th-century France. Pierre Mignard became the first painter to King Louis XIV during this period. In 1648, the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture (Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture) was established to accommodate for the dramatic interest in art in the capital. This served as France's top art school until 1793.[231] Auguste Renoir, Bal du moulin de la Galette, 1876, oil on canvas, 131 cm × 175 cm (52 in × 69 in), Musée d'Orsay Paris was in its artistic prime in the 19th century and early 20th century, when it had a colony of artists established in the city and in art schools associated with some of the finest painters of the times: Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Édouard Manet, Claude Monet, Berthe Morisot, Paul Gauguin, Pierre-Auguste Renoir and others. The French Revolution and political and social change in France had a profound influence on art in the capital. Paris was central to the development of Romanticism in art, with painters such as Géricault.[231] Impressionism, Art Nouveau, Symbolism, Fauvism, Cubism and Art Deco movements all evolved in Paris.[231] In the late 19th century, many artists in the French provinces and worldwide flocked to Paris to exhibit their works in the numerous salons and expositions and make a name for themselves.[232] Artists such as Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Vincent van Gogh, Paul Cézanne, Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Henri Rousseau, Marc Chagall, Amedeo Modigliani and many others became associated with Paris. Picasso, living in Le Bateau-Lavoir in Montmartre, painted his famous La Famille de Saltimbanques and Les Demoiselles d'Avignon between 1905 and 1907.[233] Montmartre and Montparnasse became centres for artistic production. The most prestigious names of French and foreign sculptors, who made their reputation in Paris in the modern era, are Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi (Statue of Liberty – Liberty Enlightening the World), Auguste Rodin, Camille Claudel, Antoine Bourdelle, Paul Landowski (statue of Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro) and Aristide Maillol. The Golden Age of the School of Paris ended between the two world wars. Photography[edit] The inventor Nicéphore Niépce produced the first permanent photograph on a polished pewter plate in Paris in 1825. In 1839, after the death of Niépce, Louis Daguerre patented the Daguerrotype, which became the most common form of photography until the 1860s. [231] The work of Étienne-Jules Marey in the 1880s contributed considerably to the development of modern photography. Photography came to occupy a central role in Parisian Surrealist activity, in the works of Man Ray and Maurice Tabard.[234][235] Numerous photographers achieved renown for their photography of Paris, including Eugène Atget, noted for his depictions of street scenes, Robert Doisneau, noted for his playful pictures of people and market scenes (among which Le baiser de l'hôtel de ville has become iconic of the romantic vision of Paris), Marcel Bovis, noted for his night scenes, as well as others such as Jacques-Henri Lartigue and Henri Cartier-Bresson.[231] Poster art also became an important art form in Paris in the late nineteenth century, through the work of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Jules Chéret, Eugène Grasset, Adolphe Willette, Pierre Bonnard, Georges de Feure, Henri-Gabriel Ibels, Paul Gavarni and Alphonse Mucha.[231] Museums[edit] Main article: List of museums in Paris Louvre Musée d'Orsay The Louvre received 2.7 million visitors in 2020, a drop of 72 percent from the 9.6 million visitors in 2019. The Louvre was closed for 150 days during the year because of the Covid-19 virus, but it still retained its position as first in the list of the Most visited art museums in the world. [236] Its treasures include the Mona Lisa (La Joconde), the Venus de Milo statue, Liberty Leading the People. The second-most visited museum in the city in 2020, and 12th most visited art museum in the world, with 3.5 million visitors, was the Centre Georges Pompidou, also known as Beaubourg, which houses the Musée National d'Art Moderne.[17] The third most visited Paris museum, in a building constructed for the Paris Universal Exhibition of 1900 as the Orsay railway station, was the Musée d'Orsay, which had 3.3 million visitors in 2020, the 12th most visited art museum in 2020, but a drop of 76 percent in visitors from 2019.[237] The Orsay displays French art of the 19th century, including major collections of the Impressionists and Post-Impressionists. The Musée de l'Orangerie, near both the Louvre and the Orsay, also exhibits Impressionists and Post-Impressionists, including most of Claude Monet's large Water Lilies murals. The Musée national du Moyen Âge, or Cluny Museum, presents Medieval art, including the famous tapestry cycle of The Lady and the Unicorn. The Guimet Museum, or Musée national des arts asiatiques, has one of the largest collections of Asian art in Europe. There are also notable museums devoted to individual artists, including the Musée Picasso, the Musée Rodin and the Musée national Eugène Delacroix. Musée du quai Branly Paris hosts one of the largest science museums in Europe, the Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie at La Villette. It attracted 2.2 million visitors in 2018.[238] The National Museum of Natural History located near the Jardin des plantes attracted two million visitors in 2018.[238] It is famous for its dinosaur artefacts, mineral collections and its Gallery of Evolution. The military history of France, from the Middle Ages to World War II, is vividly presented by displays at the Musée de l'Armée at Les Invalides, near the tomb of Napoleon. In addition to the national museums, run by the Ministry of Culture, the City of Paris operates 14 museums, including the Carnavalet Museum on the history of Paris, Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, Palais de Tokyo, the House of Victor Hugo, the House of Balzac and the Catacombs of Paris.[239] There are also notable private museums; The Contemporary Art museum of the Louis Vuitton Foundation, designed by architect Frank Gehry, opened in October 2014 in the Bois de Boulogne. Theatre[edit] The Opéra Bastille The largest opera houses of Paris are the 19th-century Opéra Garnier (historical Paris Opéra) and modern Opéra Bastille; the former tends toward the more classic ballets and operas, and the latter provides a mixed repertoire of classic and modern.[240] In middle of the 19th century, there were three other active and competing opera houses: the Opéra-Comique (which still exists), Théâtre-Italien and Théâtre Lyrique (which in modern times changed its profile and name to Théâtre de la Ville).[241] Philharmonie de Paris, the modern symphonic concert hall of Paris, opened in January 2015. Another musical landmark is the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, where the first performances of Diaghilev's Ballets Russes took place in 1913. The Comédie Française (Salle Richelieu) Theatre traditionally has occupied a large place in Parisian culture, and many of its most popular actors today are also stars of French television. The oldest and most famous Paris theatre is the Comédie-Française, founded in 1680. Run by the Government of France, it performs mostly French classics at the Salle Richelieu in the Palais-Royal at 2 rue de Richelieu, next to the Louvre.[242] of Other famous theatres include the Odéon-Théâtre de l'Europe, next to the Luxembourg Gardens, also a state institution and theatrical landmark; the Théâtre Mogador, and the Théâtre de la Gaîté-Montparnasse.[243] The music hall and cabaret are famous Paris institutions. The Moulin Rouge was opened in 1889. It was highly visible because of its large red imitation windmill on its roof, and became the birthplace of the dance known as the French Cancan. It helped make famous the singers Mistinguett and Édith Piaf and the painter Toulouse-Lautrec, who made posters for the venue. In 1911, the dance hall Olympia Paris invented the grand staircase as a settling for its shows, competing with its great rival, the Folies Bergère. Its stars in the 1920s included the American singer and dancer Josephine Baker. Later, Olympia Paris presented Dalida, Edith Piaf, Marlene Dietrich, Miles Davis, Judy Garland and the Grateful Dead. The Casino de Paris presented many famous French singers, including Mistinguett, Maurice Chevalier and Tino Rossi. Other famous Paris music halls include Le Lido, on the Champs-Élysées, opened in 1946; and the Crazy Horse Saloon, featuring strip-tease, dance and magic, opened in 1951. A half dozen music halls exist today in Paris, attended mostly by visitors to the city.[244] Literature[edit] Main article: Writers in Paris Victor Hugo The first book printed in France, Epistolae (""Letters""), by Gasparinus de Bergamo (Gasparino da Barzizza), was published in Paris in 1470 by the press established by Johann Heynlin. Since then, Paris has been the centre of the French publishing industry, the home of some of the world's best-known writers and poets, and the setting for many classic works of French literature. Almost all the books published in Paris in the Middle Ages were in Latin, rather than French. Paris did not become the acknowledged capital of French literature until the 17th century, with authors such as Boileau, Corneille, La Fontaine, Molière, Racine, Charles Perrault,[245] several coming from the provinces, as well as the foundation of the Académie française.[246] In the 18th century, the literary life of Paris revolved around the cafés and salons; it was dominated by Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Pierre de Marivaux and Pierre Beaumarchais. During the 19th century, Paris was the home and subject for some of France's greatest writers, including Charles Baudelaire, Stéphane Mallarmé, Mérimée, Alfred de Musset, Marcel Proust, Émile Zola, Alexandre Dumas, Gustave Flaubert, Guy de Maupassant and Honoré de Balzac. Victor Hugo's The Hunchback of Notre Dame inspired the renovation of its setting, the Notre-Dame de Paris.[247] Another of Victor Hugo's works, Les Misérables, written while he was in exile outside France during the Second Empire, described the social change and political turmoil in Paris in the early 1830s.[248] One of the most popular of all French writers, Jules Verne, worked at the Theatre Lyrique and the Paris stock exchange, while he did research for his stories at the National Library.[249][verification needed] Jean-Paul Sartre In the 20th century, the Paris literary community was dominated by figures such as Colette, André Gide, François Mauriac, André Malraux, Albert Camus, and, after World War II, by Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre. Between the wars it was the home of many important expatriate writers, including Ernest Hemingway, Samuel Beckett, Miguel Ángel Asturias, Alejo Carpentier and, Arturo Uslar Pietri. The winner of the 2014 Nobel Prize in Literature, Patrick Modiano (who lives in Paris), based most of his literary work on the depiction of the city during World War II and the 1960s–1970s.[250] Paris is a city of books and bookstores. In the 1970s, 80 percent of French-language publishing houses were found in Paris, almost all on the Left Bank in the 5th, 6th and 7th arrondissements. Since that time, because of high prices, some publishers have moved out to the less expensive areas.[251] It is also a city of small bookstores. There are about 150 bookstores in the 5th arrondissement alone, plus another 250 book stalls along the Seine. Small Paris bookstores are protected against competition from discount booksellers by French law; books, even e-books, cannot be discounted more than five percent below their publisher's cover price.[252] Music[edit] Main articles: Music in Paris and History of music in Paris Olympia, a famous music hall In the late 12th century, a school of polyphony was established at Notre-Dame. Among the Trouvères of northern France, a group of Parisian aristocrats became known for their poetry and songs. Troubadours, from the south of France, were also popular. During the reign of François I, in the Renaissance era, the lute became popular in the French court. The French royal family and courtiers ""disported themselves in masques, ballets, allegorical dances, recitals, and opera and comedy"", and a national musical printing house was established.[231] In the Baroque-era, noted composers included Jean-Baptiste Lully, Jean-Philippe Rameau, and François Couperin.[231] The Conservatoire de Musique de Paris was founded in 1795.[253] By 1870, Paris had become an important centre for symphony, ballet and operatic music. Romantic-era composers (in Paris) include Hector Berlioz (La Symphonie fantastique), Charles Gounod (Faust), Camille Saint-Saëns (Samson et Delilah), Léo Delibes (Lakmé) and Jules Massenet (Thaïs), among others.[231] Georges Bizet's Carmen premiered 3 March 1875. Carmen has since become one of the most popular and frequently-performed operas in the classical canon.[254][255] Among the Impressionist composers who created new works for piano, orchestra, opera, chamber music and other musical forms, stand in particular, Claude Debussy (Suite bergamasque, and its well-known third movement, Clair de lune, La Mer, Pelléas et Mélisande), Erik Satie (Gymnopédies, ""Je te veux"", Gnossiennes, Parade) and Maurice Ravel (Miroirs, Boléro, La valse, L'heure espagnole). Several foreign-born composers, such as Frédéric Chopin (Poland), Franz Liszt (Hungary), Jacques Offenbach (Germany), Niccolò Paganini (Italy), and Igor Stravinsky (Russia), established themselves or made significant contributions both with their works and their influence in Paris. Charles Aznavour Bal-musette is a style of French music and dance that first became popular in Paris in the 1870s and 1880s; by 1880 Paris had some 150 dance halls in the working-class neighbourhoods of the city.[256] Patrons danced the bourrée to the accompaniment of the cabrette (a bellows-blown bagpipe locally called a ""musette"") and often the vielle à roue (hurdy-gurdy) in the cafés and bars of the city. Parisian and Italian musicians who played the accordion adopted the style and established themselves in Auvergnat bars especially in the 19th arrondissement,[257] and the romantic sounds of the accordion has since become one of the musical icons of the city. Paris became a major centre for jazz and still attracts jazz musicians from all around the world to its clubs and cafés.[258] Paris is the spiritual home of gypsy jazz in particular, and many of the Parisian jazzmen who developed in the first half of the 20th century began by playing Bal-musette in the city.[257] Django Reinhardt rose to fame in Paris, having moved to the 18th arrondissement in a caravan as a young boy, and performed with violinist Stéphane Grappelli and their Quintette du Hot Club de France in the 1930s and 1940s.[259] Immediately after the War the Saint-Germain-des-Pres quarter and the nearby Saint-Michel quarter became home to many small jazz clubs, mostly found in cellars because of a lack of space; these included the Caveau des Lorientais, the Club Saint-Germain, the Rose Rouge, the Vieux-Colombier, and the most famous, Le Tabou. They introduced Parisians to the music of Claude Luter, Boris Vian, Sydney Bechet, Mezz Mezzrow, and Henri Salvador. Most of the clubs closed by the early 1960s, as musical tastes shifted toward rock and roll.[260] Some of the finest manouche musicians in the world are found here playing the cafés of the city at night.[259] Some of the more notable jazz venues include the New Morning, Le Sunset, La Chope des Puces and Bouquet du Nord.[258][259] Several yearly festivals take place in Paris, including the Paris Jazz Festival and the rock festival Rock en Seine.[261] The Orchestre de Paris was established in 1967.[262] On 19 December 2015, Paris and other worldwide fans commemorated the 100th anniversary of the birth of Edith Piaf—a cabaret singer-songwriter and actress who became widely regarded as France's national chanteuse, as well as being one of France's greatest international stars.[263] Other singers—of similar style—include Maurice Chevalier, Charles Aznavour, Yves Montand, as well as Charles Trenet. Paris has a big hip hop scene. This music became popular during the 1980s.[264] The presence of a large African and Caribbean community helped to its development, it gave a voice, a political and social status for many minorities.[265] Cinema[edit] See also: List of films set in Paris The movie industry was born in Paris when Auguste and Louis Lumière projected the first motion picture for a paying audience at the Grand Café on 28 December 1895.[266] Many of Paris' concert/dance halls were transformed into cinemas when the media became popular beginning in the 1930s. Later, most of the largest cinemas were divided into multiple, smaller rooms. Paris' largest cinema room today is in the Grand Rex theatre with 2,700 seats.[267]Big multiplex cinemas have been built since the 1990s. UGC Ciné Cité Les Halles with 27 screens, MK2 Bibliothèque with 20 screens and UGC Ciné Cité Bercy with 18 screens are among the largest.[268] Parisians tend to share the same movie-going trends as many of the world's global cities, with cinemas primarily dominated by Hollywood-generated film entertainment. French cinema comes a close second, with major directors (réalisateurs) such as Claude Lelouch, Jean-Luc Godard, and Luc Besson, and the more slapstick/popular genre with director Claude Zidi as an example. European and Asian films are also widely shown and appreciated.[269] On 2 February 2000, Philippe Binant realised the first digital cinema projection in Europe, with the DLP CINEMA technology developed by Texas Instruments, in Paris.[270][271] Restaurants and cuisine[edit] See also: French cuisine Dining room of the Vagenende Le Zimmer, on the Place du Châtelet, where Géo Lefèvre first suggested the idea of a Tour de France to Henri Desgrange in 1902 Since the late 18th century, Paris has been famous for its restaurants and haute cuisine, food meticulously prepared and artfully presented. A luxury restaurant, La Taverne Anglaise, opened in 1786 in the arcades of the Palais-Royal by Antoine Beauvilliers; it featured an elegant dining room, an extensive menu, linen tablecloths, a large wine list and well-trained waiters; it became a model for future Paris restaurants. The restaurant Le Grand Véfour in the Palais-Royal dates from the same period.[272] The famous Paris restaurants of the 19th century, including the Café de Paris, the Rocher de Cancale, the Café Anglais, Maison Dorée and the Café Riche, were mostly located near the theatres on the Boulevard des Italiens; they were immortalised in the novels of Balzac and Émile Zola. Several of the best-known restaurants in Paris today appeared during the Belle Époque, including Maxim's on Rue Royale, Ledoyen in the gardens of the Champs-Élysées, and the Tour d'Argent on the Quai de la Tournelle.[273] Today, due to Paris' cosmopolitan population, every French regional cuisine and almost every national cuisine in the world can be found there; the city has more than 9,000 restaurants.[274] The Michelin Guide has been a standard guide to French restaurants since 1900, awarding its highest award, three stars, to the best restaurants in France. In 2018, of the 27 Michelin three-star restaurants in France, ten are located in Paris. These include both restaurants which serve classical French cuisine, such as L'Ambroisie in the Place des Vosges, and those which serve non-traditional menus, such as L'Astrance, which combines French and Asian cuisines. Several of France's most famous chefs, including Pierre Gagnaire, Alain Ducasse, Yannick Alléno and Alain Passard, have three-star restaurants in Paris.[275][276] Les Deux Magots café on Boulevard Saint-Germain In addition to the classical restaurants, Paris has several other kinds of traditional eating places. The café arrived in Paris in the 17th century, when the beverage was first brought from Turkey, and by the 18th century Parisian cafés were centres of the city's political and cultural life. The Café Procope on the Left Bank dates from this period. In the 20th century, the cafés of the Left Bank, especially Café de la Rotonde and Le Dôme Café in Montparnasse and Café de Flore and Les Deux Magots on Boulevard Saint Germain, all still in business, were important meeting places for painters, writers and philosophers.[273] A bistro is a type of eating place loosely defined as a neighbourhood restaurant with a modest decor and prices and a regular clientele and a congenial atmosphere. Its name is said to have come in 1814 from the Russian soldiers who occupied the city; ""bistro"" means ""quickly"" in Russian, and they wanted their meals served rapidly so they could get back their encampment. Real bistros are increasingly rare in Paris, due to rising costs, competition from cheaper ethnic restaurants, and different eating habits of Parisian diners.[277] A brasserie originally was a tavern located next to a brewery, which served beer and food at any hour. Beginning with the Paris Exposition of 1867; it became a popular kind of restaurant which featured beer and other beverages served by young women in the national costume associated with the beverage, particular German costumes for beer. Now brasseries, like cafés, serve food and drinks throughout the day.[278] Fashion[edit] Main article: French fashion Magdalena Frackowiak at Paris Fashion Week (Fall 2011) Since the 19th century, Paris has been an international fashion capital, particularly in the domain of haute couture (clothing hand-made to order for private clients).[279] It is home to some of the largest fashion houses in the world, including Dior and Chanel, as well as many other well-known and more contemporary fashion designers, such as Karl Lagerfeld, Jean-Paul Gaultier, Yves Saint Laurent, Givenchy, and Christian Lacroix. Paris Fashion Week, held in January and July in the Carrousel du Louvre among other renowned city locations, is one of the top four events on the international fashion calendar. The other fashion capitals of the world, Milan, London, and New York also host fashion weeks.[280][281] Moreover, Paris is also the home of the world's largest cosmetics company: L'Oréal as well as three of the top five global makers of luxury fashion accessories: Louis Vuitton, Hermés, and Cartier.[282] Most of the major fashion designers have their showrooms along the Avenue Montaigne, between the Champs-Élysées and the Seine. Holidays and festivals[edit] Republican Guards parading on Bastille Day Bastille Day, a celebration of the storming of the Bastille in 1789, the biggest festival in the city, is a military parade taking place every year on 14 July on the Champs-Élysées, from the Arc de Triomphe to Place de la Concorde. It includes a flypast over the Champs Élysées by the Patrouille de France, a parade of military units and equipment, and a display of fireworks in the evening, the most spectacular being the one at the Eiffel Tower.[283] Some other yearly festivals are Paris-Plages, a festive event that lasts from mid-July to mid-August when the Right Bank of the Seine is converted into a temporary beach with sand, deck chairs and palm trees;[283] Journées du Patrimoine, Fête de la Musique, Techno Parade, Nuit Blanche, Cinéma au clair de lune, Printemps des rues, Festival d'automne, and Fête des jardins. The Carnaval de Paris, one of the oldest festivals in Paris, dates back to the Middle Ages. Education[edit] Main article: Education in Paris The main building of the former University of Paris is now used by classes from Sorbonne University, New Sorbonne University and other autonomous campuses. Paris is the département with the highest proportion of highly educated people. In 2009, around 40 percent of Parisians held a licence-level diploma or higher, the highest proportion in France,[284] while 13 percent have no diploma, the third-lowest percentage in France. Education in Paris and the Île-de-France region employs approximately 330,000 people, 170,000 of whom are teachers and professors teaching approximately 2.9 million children and students in around 9,000 primary, secondary, and higher education schools and institutions.[285] The University of Paris, founded in the 12th century, is often called the Sorbonne after one of its original medieval colleges. It was broken up into thirteen autonomous universities in 1970, following the student demonstrations in 1968. Most of the campuses today are in the Latin Quarter where the old university was located, while others are scattered around the city and the suburbs.[286] The École des hautes études en sciences sociales (EHESS), France's most prestigious university in the social sciences, is headquartered in the 6th arrondissement. The Paris region hosts France's highest concentration of the grandes écoles – 55 specialised centres of higher-education outside or inside the public university structure. The prestigious public universities are usually considered grands établissements. Most of the grandes écoles were relocated to the suburbs of Paris in the 1960s and 1970s, in new campuses much larger than the old campuses within the crowded City of Paris, though the École Normale Supérieure, PSL University has remained on rue d'Ulm in the 5th arrondissement.[287] There are a high number of engineering schools, led by the PSL University (which comprises several colleges such as École des Mines, École nationale supérieure de chimie, École Pratique des Hautes Études and Paris-Dauphine), the Paris-Saclay University (which comprises several colleges such as AgroParisTech, CentraleSupélec and ENS Paris-Saclay) the Polytechnic Institute of Paris (which comprises several colleges such as École Polytechnique, Télécom Paris and École nationale de la statistique et de l'administration économique) and also independent colleges such as École des Ponts et Chaussées or Arts et Métiers. There are also many business schools, including HEC, INSEAD, ESSEC, and ESCP Europe. The administrative school such as ENA has been relocated to Strasbourg, the political science school Sciences-Po is still located in Paris' 7th arrondissement, the most prestigious university for social sciences, the École des hautes études en sciences sociales is located in Paris' 6th arrondissement and the most prestigious university of economics and finance, Paris-Dauphine, is located in Paris' 16th. The Parisian school of journalism CELSA department of Sorbonne University is located in Neuilly-sur-Seine.[288] Paris is also home to several of France's most famous high-schools such as Lycée Louis-le-Grand, Lycée Henri-IV, Lycée Janson de Sailly and Lycée Condorcet. The National Institute of Sport and Physical Education, located in the 12th arrondissement, is both a physical education institute and high-level training centre for elite athletes. Libraries[edit] Main article: Libraries in Paris Sainte-Geneviève Library The Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF) operates public libraries in Paris, among them the François Mitterrand Library, Richelieu Library, Louvois, Opéra Library, and Arsenal Library.[289] There are three public libraries in the 4th arrondissement. The Forney Library, in the Marais district, is dedicated to the decorative arts; the Arsenal Library occupies a former military building, and has a large collection on French literature; and the Bibliothèque historique de la ville de Paris, also in Le Marais, contains the Paris historical research service. The Sainte-Geneviève Library is in 5th arrondissement; designed by Henri Labrouste and built in the mid-1800s, it contains a rare book and manuscript division.[290] Bibliothèque Mazarine, in the 6th arrondissement, is the oldest public library in France. The Médiathèque Musicale Mahler in the 8th arrondissement opened in 1986 and contains collections related to music. The François Mitterrand Library (nicknamed Très Grande Bibliothèque) in the 13th arrondissement was completed in 1994 to a design of Dominique Perrault and contains four glass towers.[290] There are several academic libraries and archives in Paris. The Sorbonne Library in the 5th arrondissement is the largest university library in Paris. In addition to the Sorbonne location, there are branches in Malesherbes, Clignancourt-Championnet, Michelet-Institut d'Art et d'Archéologie, Serpente-Maison de la Recherche, and Institut des Etudes Ibériques.[291] Other academic libraries include Interuniversity Pharmaceutical Library, Leonardo da Vinci University Library, Paris School of Mines Library, and the René Descartes University Library.[292] Sports[edit] Parc des Princes. Paris' most popular sport clubs are the association football club Paris Saint-Germain F.C. and the rugby union clubs Stade Français and Racing 92, the last of which is based just outside the city proper. The 80,000-seat Stade de France, built for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, is located just north of Paris in the commune of Saint-Denis.[293] It is used for football, rugby union and track and field athletics. It hosts the French national football team for friendlies and major tournaments qualifiers, annually hosts the French national rugby team's home matches of the Six Nations Championship, and hosts several important matches of the Stade Français rugby team.[293] In addition to Paris Saint-Germain F.C., the city has a number of other professional and amateur football clubs: Paris FC, Red Star, RCF Paris and Stade Français Paris. 2010 Tour de France, Champs Élysées. Paris hosted the 1900 and 1924 Summer Olympics and will host the 2024 Summer Olympics and Paralympic Games. The city also hosted the finals of the 1938 FIFA World Cup (at the Stade Olympique de Colombes), as well as the 1998 FIFA World Cup and the 2007 Rugby World Cup Final (both at the Stade de France). Two UEFA Champions League Finals in the current century have also been played in the Stade de France: the 2000 and 2006 editions.[294] Paris has most recently been the host for UEFA Euro 2016, both at the Parc des Princes in the city proper and also at Stade de France, with the latter hosting the opening match and final. The final stage of the most famous bicycle racing in the world, Tour de France, always finishes in Paris. Since 1975, the race has finished on the Champs-Elysées.[295] Tennis is another popular sport in Paris and throughout France; the French Open, held every year on the red clay of the Roland Garros National Tennis Centre,[296] is one of the four Grand Slam events of the world professional tennis tour. The 17,000-seat Bercy Arena (officially named AccorHotels Arena and formerly known as the Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy) is the venue for the annual Paris Masters ATP Tour tennis tournament and has been a frequent site of national and international tournaments in basketball, boxing, cycling, handball, ice hockey, show jumping and other sports. The Bercy Arena also hosted the 2017 IIHF World Ice Hockey Championship, together with Cologne, Germany. The final stages of the FIBA EuroBasket 1951 and EuroBasket 1999 were also played in Paris, the latter at the Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy. The basketball team Levallois Metropolitans plays some of its games at the 4,000 capacity Stade Pierre de Coubertin.[297] Another top-level professional team, Nanterre 92, plays in Nanterre. Infrastructure[edit] Transport[edit] Main article: Transport in Paris See also: List of railway stations in Paris The Gare du Nord railway station is the busiest in Europe. Paris is a major rail, highway, and air transport hub. Île-de-France Mobilités (IDFM), formerly the Syndicat des transports d'Île-de-France (STIF) and before that the Syndicat des transports parisiens (STP), oversees the transit network in the region.[298] The syndicate coordinates public transport and contracts it out to the RATP (operating 347 bus lines, the Métro, eight tramway lines, and sections of the RER), the SNCF (operating suburban rails, one tramway line and the other sections of the RER) and the Optile consortium of private operators managing 1,176 bus lines.[299] Bike lanes are being doubled, while electric car incentives are being created. The French capital is banning the most polluting automobiles from key districts.[300][301] Railways[edit] See also: List of railway stations in Paris A central hub of the national rail network, Paris' six major railway stations (Gare du Nord, Gare de l'Est, Gare de Lyon, Gare d'Austerlitz, Gare Montparnasse, Gare Saint-Lazare) and a minor one (Gare de Bercy) are connected to three networks: the TGV serving four high-speed rail lines, the normal speed Corail trains, and the suburban rails (Transilien). Métro, RER and tramway[edit] Main article: Paris Métro The Paris Métro is the busiest subway network in the European Union. Since the inauguration of its first line in 1900, Paris's Métro network has grown to become the city's most widely used local transport system; today it carries about 5.23 million passengers daily[302] through 16 lines, 303 stations (385 stops) and 220 km (136.7 mi) of rails. Superimposed on this is a 'regional express network', the RER, whose five lines (A, B, C, D, and E), 257 stops and 587 km (365 mi) of rails connect Paris to more distant parts of the urban area.[303] Over €26.5 billion will be invested over the next 15 years to extend the Métro network into the suburbs,[303] with notably the Grand Paris Express project. In addition, the Paris region is served by a light rail network of nine lines, the tramway: Line T1 runs from Asnières-Gennevilliers to Noisy-le-Sec, Line T2 runs from Pont de Bezons to Porte de Versailles, Line T3a runs from Pont du Garigliano to Porte de Vincennes, Line T3b runs from Porte de Vincennes to Porte d'Asnières, Line T5 runs from Saint-Denis to Garges-Sarcelles, Line T6 runs from Châtillon to Viroflay, Line T7 runs from Villejuif to Athis-Mons, Line T8 runs from Saint-Denis to Épinay-sur-Seine and Villetaneuse, all of which are operated by the RATP Group,[304] and line T4 runs from Bondy RER to Aulnay-sous-Bois, which is operated by the state rail carrier SNCF.[303] Five new light rail lines are currently in various stages of development.[305] Air[edit] In 2020 Paris–Charles de Gaulle Airport was the busiest airport in Europe and the eighth-busiest airport in the world.[306] Busiest destinations from Parisairports (CDG, ORY, BVA) in 2014 Domestic destinations Passengers Toulouse 3,158,331 Nice 2,865,602 Bordeaux 1,539,478 Marseille 1,502,196 Pointe-à-Pitre 1,191,437 Saint-Denis (Réunion) 1,108,964 Fort-de-France 1,055,770 Other domestic destinations Montpellier 807,482 Biarritz 684,578 Lyon 613,395 International destinations Passengers Italy 7,881,497 Spain 7,193,481 United States 6,495,677 Germany 4,685,313 United Kingdom 4,177,519 Morocco 3,148,479 Portugal 3,018,446 Algeria 2,351,402 China 2,141,527 Other international destinations Switzerland 1,727,169 Paris is a major international air transport hub with the 5th busiest airport system in the world. The city is served by three commercial international airports: Paris–Charles de Gaulle, Paris–Orly and Beauvais–Tillé Airport. Together these three airports recorded traffic of 96.5 million passengers in 2014.[307] There is also one general aviation airport, Paris-Le Bourget, historically the oldest Parisian airport and closest to the city centre, which is now used only for private business flights and air shows. Orly Airport, located in the southern suburbs of Paris, replaced Le Bourget as the principal airport of Paris from the 1950s to the 1980s.[308] Charles de Gaulle Airport, located on the edge of the northern suburbs of Paris, opened to commercial traffic in 1974 and became the busiest Parisian airport in 1993.[309] For the year 2017 it was the 5th busiest airport in the world by international traffic and it is the hub for the nation's flag carrier Air France.[303] Beauvais-Tillé Airport, located 69 kilometres (43 miles) north of Paris' city centre, is used by charter airlines and low-cost carriers such as Ryanair. Domestically, air travel between Paris and some of France's largest cities such as Lyon, Marseille, or Strasbourg has been in a large measure replaced by high-speed rail due to the opening of several high-speed TGV rail lines from the 1980s. For example, after the LGV Méditerranée opened in 2001, air traffic between Paris and Marseille declined from 2,976,793 passengers in 2000 to 1,502,196 passengers in 2014.[310] After the LGV Est opened in 2007, air traffic between Paris and Strasbourg declined from 1,006,327 passengers in 2006 to 157,207 passengers in 2014.[310] Internationally, air traffic has increased markedly in recent years between Paris and the Gulf airports, the emerging nations of Africa, Russia, Turkey, Portugal, Italy, and mainland China, whereas noticeable decline has been recorded between Paris and the British Isles, Egypt, Tunisia, and Japan.[311][312] Motorways[edit] Ring roads of Paris The city is also the most important hub of France's motorway network, and is surrounded by three orbital freeways: the Périphérique,[105] which follows the approximate path of 19th-century fortifications around Paris, the A86 motorway in the inner suburbs, and finally the Francilienne motorway in the outer suburbs. Paris has an extensive road network with over 2,000 km (1,243 mi) of highways and motorways. Waterways[edit] The Paris region is the most active water transport area in France, with most of the cargo handled by Ports of Paris in facilities located around Paris. The rivers Loire, Rhine, Rhône, Meuse, and Scheldt can be reached by canals connecting with the Seine, which include the Canal Saint-Martin, Canal Saint-Denis, and the Canal de l'Ourcq.[313] Cycling[edit] Vélib' at the Place de la Bastille There are 440 km (270 mi) of cycle paths and routes in Paris. These include piste cyclable (bike lanes separated from other traffic by physical barriers such as a kerb) and bande cyclable (a bicycle lane denoted by a painted path on the road). Some 29 km (18 mi) of specially marked bus lanes are free to be used by cyclists, with a protective barrier protecting against encroachments from vehicles.[314] Cyclists have also been given the right to ride in both directions on certain one-way streets. Paris offers a bike sharing system called Vélib' with more than 20,000 public bicycles distributed at 1,800 parking stations,[315] which can be rented for short and medium distances including one way trips. Electricity[edit] Electricity is provided to Paris through a peripheral grid fed by multiple sources. As of 2012[update], around 50% of electricity generated in the Île-de-France comes from cogeneration energy plants located near the outer limits of the region; other energy sources include the Nogent Nuclear Power Plant (35%), trash incineration (9% – with cogeneration plants, these provide the city in heat as well), methane gas (5%), hydraulics (1%), solar power (0.1%) and a negligible amount of wind power (0.034 GWh).[316] A quarter of the city's district heating is to come from a plant in Saint-Ouen-sur-Seine, burning a 50/50-mix of coal and 140,000 tonnes of wood pellets from the United States per year.[317] Water and sanitation[edit] A view of the Seine, the Île de la Cité and a Bateau Mouche Paris in its early history had only the rivers Seine and Bièvre for water. From 1809, the Canal de l'Ourcq provided Paris with water from less-polluted rivers to the north-east of the capital.[318] From 1857, the civil engineer Eugène Belgrand, under Napoleon III, oversaw the construction of a series of new aqueducts that brought water from locations all around the city to several reservoirs built atop the Capital's highest points of elevation.[319] From then on, the new reservoir system became Paris' principal source of drinking water, and the remains of the old system, pumped into lower levels of the same reservoirs, were from then on used for the cleaning of Paris' streets. This system is still a major part of Paris' modern water-supply network. Today Paris has more than 2,400 km (1,491 mi) of underground passageways[320] dedicated to the evacuation of Paris' liquid wastes. In 1982, Mayor Chirac introduced the motorcycle-mounted Motocrotte to remove dog faeces from Paris streets.[321] The project was abandoned in 2002 for a new and better enforced local law, under the terms of which dog owners can be fined up to €500 for not removing their dog faeces.[322] The air pollution in Paris, from the point of view of particulate matter (PM10), is the highest in France with 38 μg/m3.[323] Parks and gardens[edit] Main articles: List of parks and gardens in Paris and History of Parks and Gardens of Paris The lawns of the Parc des Buttes-Chaumont on a sunny day The Passerelle de l'Avre, crossing the Seine and establishing a link between the Bois de Boulogne and Saint-Cloud in Hauts-de-Seine, is the City of Paris's westernmost point. Paris today has more than 421 municipal parks and gardens, covering more than 3,000 hectares and containing more than 250,000 trees.[324] Two of Paris's oldest and most famous gardens are the Tuileries Garden (created in 1564 for the Tuileries Palace and redone by André Le Nôtre between 1664 and 1672)[325] and the Luxembourg Garden, for the Luxembourg Palace, built for Marie de' Medici in 1612, which today houses the Senate.[326] The Jardin des plantes was the first botanical garden in Paris, created in 1626 by Louis XIII's doctor Guy de La Brosse for the cultivation of medicinal plants.[327] Between 1853 and 1870, Emperor Napoleon III and the city's first director of parks and gardens, Jean-Charles Adolphe Alphand, created the Bois de Boulogne, Bois de Vincennes, Parc Montsouris and Parc des Buttes-Chaumont, located at the four points of the compass around the city, as well as many smaller parks, squares and gardens in the Paris's quarters.[328] Since 1977, the city has created 166 new parks, most notably the Parc de la Villette (1987), Parc André Citroën (1992), Parc de Bercy (1997) and Parc Clichy-Batignolles (2007).[329] One of the newest parks, the Promenade des Berges de la Seine (2013), built on a former highway on the left bank of the Seine between the Pont de l'Alma and the Musée d'Orsay, has floating gardens and gives a view of the city's landmarks. Weekly Parkruns take place in the Bois de Boulogne and the Parc Montsouris [330][331] Cemeteries[edit] The Paris Catacombs hold the remains of approximately 6 million people. During the Roman era, the city's main cemetery was located to the outskirts of the left bank settlement, but this changed with the rise of Catholic Christianity, where most every inner-city church had adjoining burial grounds for use by their parishes. With Paris's growth many of these, particularly the city's largest cemetery, the Holy Innocents' Cemetery, were filled to overflowing, creating quite unsanitary conditions for the capital. When inner-city burials were condemned from 1786, the contents of all Paris' parish cemeteries were transferred to a renovated section of Paris's stone mines outside the ""Porte d'Enfer"" city gate, today place Denfert-Rochereau in the 14th arrondissement.[332][333] The process of moving bones from the Cimetière des Innocents to the catacombs took place between 1786 and 1814;[334] part of the network of tunnels and remains can be visited today on the official tour of the catacombs. After a tentative creation of several smaller suburban cemeteries, the Prefect Nicholas Frochot under Napoleon Bonaparte provided a more definitive solution in the creation of three massive Parisian cemeteries outside the city limits.[335] Open from 1804, these were the cemeteries of Père Lachaise, Montmartre, Montparnasse, and later Passy; these cemeteries became inner-city once again when Paris annexed all neighbouring communes to the inside of its much larger ring of suburban fortifications in 1860. New suburban cemeteries were created in the early 20th century: The largest of these are the Cimetière parisien de Saint-Ouen, the Cimetière parisien de Pantin (also known as Cimetière parisien de Pantin-Bobigny), the Cimetière parisien d'Ivry, and the Cimetière parisien de Bagneux.[336] Some of the most famous people in the world are buried in Parisian cemeteries, such as Oscar Wilde, Frederic Chopin, Jim Morrison, Édith Piaf and Serge Gainsbourg among others.[337] Healthcare[edit] The Hôtel-Dieu de Paris, the oldest hospital in the city Health care and emergency medical service in the City of Paris and its suburbs are provided by the Assistance publique – Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP), a public hospital system that employs more than 90,000 people (including practitioners, support personnel, and administrators) in 44 hospitals.[338] It is the largest hospital system in Europe. It provides health care, teaching, research, prevention, education and emergency medical service in 52 branches of medicine. The hospitals receive more than 5.8 million annual patient visits.[338] One of the most notable hospitals is the Hôtel-Dieu, founded in 651, the oldest hospital in the city,[339] although the current building is the product of a reconstruction of 1877. Other hospitals include Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital (one of the largest in Europe), Hôpital Cochin, Bichat–Claude Bernard Hospital, Hôpital Européen Georges-Pompidou, Bicêtre Hospital, Beaujon Hospital, the Curie Institute, Lariboisière Hospital, Necker–Enfants Malades Hospital, Hôpital Saint-Louis, Hôpital de la Charité and the American Hospital of Paris. Media[edit] Agence France-Presse Headquarters in Paris Paris and its close suburbs is home to numerous newspapers, magazines and publications including Le Monde, Le Figaro, Libération, Le Nouvel Observateur, Le Canard enchaîné, La Croix, Pariscope, Le Parisien (in Saint-Ouen), Les Échos, Paris Match (Neuilly-sur-Seine), Réseaux & Télécoms, Reuters France, and L'Officiel des Spectacles.[340] France's two most prestigious newspapers, Le Monde and Le Figaro, are the centrepieces of the Parisian publishing industry.[341] Agence France-Presse is France's oldest, and one of the world's oldest, continually operating news agencies. AFP, as it is colloquially abbreviated, maintains its headquarters in Paris, as it has since 1835.[342] France 24 is a television news channel owned and operated by the French government, and is based in Paris.[343] Another news agency is France Diplomatie, owned and operated by the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs, and pertains solely to diplomatic news and occurrences.[344] The most-viewed network in France, TF1, is in nearby Boulogne-Billancourt. France 2, France 3, Canal+, France 5, M6 (Neuilly-sur-Seine), Arte, D8, W9, NT1, NRJ 12, La Chaîne parlementaire, France 4, BFM TV, and Gulli are other stations located in and around the capital.[345] Radio France, France's public radio broadcaster, and its various channels, is headquartered in Paris' 16th arrondissement. Radio France Internationale, another public broadcaster is also based in the city.[346] Paris also holds the headquarters of the La Poste, France's national postal carrier.[347] International relations[edit] Twin towns and sister cities[edit] Column dedicated to Paris near the Baths of Diocletian in Rome Sculpture dedicated to Rome in the square Paul Painlevé in Paris See also: List of twin towns and sister cities in France Since 9 April 1956, Paris is exclusively and reciprocally twinned only with:[348][349] Rome, Italy, 1956 Seule Paris est digne de Rome ; seule Rome est digne de Paris. (in French) Solo Parigi è degna di Roma; solo Roma è degna di Parigi. (in Italian) ""Only Paris is worthy of Rome; only Rome is worthy of Paris.""[350] Other relationships[edit] Paris has agreements of friendship and co-operation with:[348] Algiers, 2003 Amman, 1987 Athens, 2000 Beijing, 1997 Beirut, 1992 Berlin, 1987 Bucharest[351] Buenos Aires, 1999 Cairo, 1985 Casablanca, 2004 Chicago, 1996 Copenhagen, 2005 Geneva, 2002 Hanoi, 2013[352] Jakarta, 1995 Kyoto, 1958 Lisbon, 1998 London, 2001 Madrid, 2000 Mexico City, 1999 Montreal, 2006 Moscow, 1992 New York City, 2007 Porto Alegre, 2001 Prague, 1997 Quebec City, 2003 Rabat, 2004 Riyadh, 1997 Saint Petersburg, 1997 Sana'a, 1987 San Francisco, 1996 Santiago, 1997 São Paulo, 2004 Seoul, 1991 Sofia, 1998 Sydney, 1998 Tbilisi, 1997 Tehran, 2004 Tokyo, 1982 Tunis, 2004 Ubon Ratchathani, 2000 Warsaw, 1999 Washington, D.C., 2000 Yerevan, 1998 See also[edit] France portal European Union portal Art Nouveau in Paris Art Deco in Paris C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group International Exposition of Modern Industrial and Decorative Arts held in Paris in 1925 Megacity Outline of France Outline of Paris Paris syndrome Notes[edit] ^ The word was most likely created by Parisians of the lower popular class who spoke *argot*, then *parigot* was used in a provocative manner outside the Parisian region and throughout France to mean Parisians in general.

173,"Water treatment - Wikipedia Water treatment From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Process that improves the quality of water For medical water treatment, see Water cure (therapy). The examples and perspective in this article deal primarily with the United States and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject. You may improve this article, discuss the issue on the talk page, or create a new article, as appropriate. (March 2019) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Dalecarlia Water Treatment Plant, Washington, D.C. Water treatment is any process that improves the quality of water to make it appropriate for a specific end-use. The end use may be drinking, industrial water supply, irrigation, river flow maintenance, water recreation or many other uses, including being safely returned to the environment. Water treatment removes contaminants and undesirable components, or reduces their concentration so that the water becomes fit for its desired end-use. This treatment is crucial to human health and allows humans to benefit from both drinking and irrigation use.

In general terms, the greatest microbial risks are associated with ingestion of water that is contaminated with human or animal (including bird) faeces. Faeces can be a source of pathogenic bacteria, viruses, protozoa and helminths. The removal or destruction of microbial pathogens is essential, and commonly involves the use of reactive chemical agents such as suspended solids, to remove bacteria, algae, viruses, fungi, and minerals including iron and manganese. Research including Professor Linda Lawton's group at Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen is working to improve detection of cyanobacteria.[1] These substances continue to cause great harm to several less developed countries who do not have access to effective water purification systems. Measures taken to ensure water quality not only relate to the treatment of the water, but to its conveyance and distribution after treatment. It is therefore common practice to keep residual disinfectants in the treated water to kill bacteriological contamination during distribution and to keep the pipes clean. Water supplied to domestic properties such as for tap water or other uses, may be further treated before use, often using an in-line treatment process. Such treatments can include water softening or ion exchange. Many proprietary systems also claim to remove residual disinfectants and heavy metal ions.[citation needed] Processes[edit] Empty aeration tank for iron precipitation The processes involved in removing the contaminants include physical processes such as settling and filtration, chemical processes such as disinfection and coagulation, and biological processes such as slow sand filtration. A combination selected from the following processes (depending on the season and contaminants and chemicals present in the raw water) is used for municipal drinking water treatment worldwide. Chemical[edit] Tanks with sand filters to remove precipitated iron (not working at the time) Pre-chlorination for algae control and arresting biological growth. Aeration along with pre-chlorination for removal of dissolved iron when present with relatively small amounts of manganese. Disinfection for killing bacteria, viruses and other pathogens, using chlorine, ozone and ultra-violet light. Physical[edit] Sedimentation for solids separation that is the removal of suspended solids trapped in the floc. Filtration to remove particles from water either by passage through a sand bed that can be washed and reused or by passage through a purpose designed filter that may be washable. Dissolved air flotation to remove suspended solids. Physio-chemical[edit] Also referred to as ""Conventional"" Treatment Coagulation for flocculation. Coagulant aids, also known as polyelectrolytes – to improve coagulation and for more robust floc formation. Polyelectrolytes or also known in the field as polymers, usually consist of either a positive or negative charge. The nature of the polyelectrolyte used is purely based on the source water characteristics of the treatment plant. These will usually be used in conjunction with a primary coagulant such as ferric chloride , ferric sulfate, or alum. Biological[edit] Slow sand filtration using a biofilm to metabolize organic matter, adsorb soluble components and entrap particulates. Technologies[edit] Technologies for potable water and other uses are well-developed, and generalized designs are available from which treatment processes can be selected for pilot testing on the specific source water. In addition, a number of private companies provide patented technological solutions for the treatment of specific contaminants. Automation of water treatment is common in the developed world. Source water quality through the seasons, scale, and environmental impact can dictate capital costs and operating costs. End use of the treated water dictates the necessary quality monitoring technologies, and locally available skills typically dictate the level of automation adopted. Desalination[edit] Saline water can be treated to yield fresh water. Two main processes are used, reverse osmosis or distillation.[2] Both methods require more energy than water treatment of local surface waters, and are usually only used in coastal areas or where water such as groundwater has high salinity.[3][4] Portable water purification[edit] Living away from drinking water supplies often requires some form of portable water treatment process. These can vary in complexity from the simple addition of a disinfectant tablet in a hiker's water bottle through to complex multi-stage processes carried by boat or plane to disaster areas. Constituent Unit processes Turbidity and particles Coagulation/ flocculation, sedimentation, granular filtration Major dissolved inorganics Softening, aeration, membranes Minor dissolved inorganics Membranes Pathogens Sedimentation, filtration, disinfection Major dissolved organics Membranes, adsorption Standards[edit] Main article: Drinking water quality standards Many developed countries specify standards to be applied in their own country. In Europe, this includes the European Drinking Water Directive[5] and in the United States the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) establishes standards as required by the Safe Drinking Water Act. For countries without a legislative or administrative framework for such standards, the World Health Organization publishes guidelines on the standards that should be achieved.[6] China adopted its own drinking water standard GB3838-2002 (Type II) enacted by Ministry of Environmental Protection in 2002.[7] Where drinking water quality standards do exist, most are expressed as guidelines or targets rather than requirements, and very few water standards have any legal basis or, are subject to enforcement.[8] Two exceptions are the European Drinking Water Directive and the Safe Drinking Water Act in the United States, which require legal compliance with specific standards. Industrial water treatment[edit] Main article: Industrial water treatment At Turun Seudun Vesi Oy's artificial groundwater plant, the pretreated raw water from the Kokemäki River is absorbed through the basins into the Virttaankangas ridge formation. Processes[edit] Two of the main processes of industrial water treatment are boiler water treatment and cooling water treatment. A large amount of proper water treatment can lead to the reaction of solids and bacteria within pipe work and boiler housing. Steam boilers can suffer from scale or corrosion when left untreated. Scale deposits can lead to weak and dangerous machinery, while additional fuel is required to heat the same level of water because of the rise in thermal resistance. Poor quality dirty water can become a breeding ground for bacteria such as Legionella causing a risk to public health. Corrosion in low pressure boilers can be caused by dissolved oxygen, acidity and excessive alkalinity. Water treatment therefore should remove the dissolved oxygen and maintain the boiler water with the appropriate pH and alkalinity levels. Without effective water treatment, a cooling water system can suffer from scale formation, corrosion and fouling and may become a breeding ground for harmful bacteria. This reduces efficiency, shortens plant life and makes operations unreliable and unsafe.[9] Boiler water treatment[edit] Boiler water treatment is a type of industrial water treatment focused on removal or chemical modification of substances potentially damaging to the boiler. Varying types of treatment are used at different locations to avoid scale, corrosion, or foaming. External treatment of raw water supplies intended for use within a boiler is focused on removal of impurities before they reach the boiler. Internal treatment within the boiler is focused on limiting the tendency of water to dissolve the boiler, and maintaining impurities in forms least likely to cause trouble before they can be removed from the boiler in boiler blowdown. Cooling water treatment[edit] Water cooling is a method of heat removal from components of machinery and industrial equipment. Water may be a more efficient heat transfer fluid where air cooling is ineffective. In most occupied climates water offers the thermal conductivity advantages of a liquid with unusually high specific heat capacity and the option that of evaporative cooling. Low cost often allows rejection as waste after a single use, but recycling coolant loops may be pressurized to eliminate evaporative loss and offer greater portability and improved cleanliness. Unpressurized recycling coolant loops using evaporative cooling require a blowdown waste stream to remove impurities concentrated by evaporation. Disadvantages of water cooling systems include accelerated corrosion and maintenance requirements to prevent heat transfer reductions from biofouling or scale formation. Chemical additives to reduce these disadvantages may introduce toxicity to wastewater. Water cooling is commonly used for cooling automobile internal combustion engines and large industrial facilities such as nuclear and steam electric power plants, hydroelectric generators, petroleum refineries and chemical plants. Technologies[edit] Chemical treatment[edit] Chemical treatments are techniques adopted to make industrial water suitable for use or discharge. These include chemical precipitation, chemical disinfection, chemical oxidation, advanced oxidation, ion exchange, and chemical neutralization.[10] Physical treatment[edit] Filtration removes particles from water either by passage through a layer of sand, such as a rapid gravity filter, or in a mechanical filter. Dissolved air flotation removes suspended solids from the water.[11] This is achieved by dissolving air in the water under pressure and then releasing the water/air at atmospheric pressure in a flotation tank. The released air forms small bubbles which adhere to the suspended matter causing them to float to the surface of the water where they can be removed by a skimming device or an overflow.[11] Biological treatment[edit] Slow sand filters use a biological process to purify raw water to produce potable water.[12] They work by using a complex biological film that grows naturally on the surface of sand. This gelatinous biofilm called the hypogeal layer or Schmutzdecke is located in the upper few millimetres of the sand layer. The surface biofilm purifies the water as it flows through the layer, the underlying sand provides a support medium for the biological treatment layer.[13] The Schmutzdecke consists of bacteria, fungi, protozoa, rotifera and a range of aquatic insect larvae. As the biofilm ages, more algae may develop and larger aquatic organisms including bryozoa, snails and Annelid worms may be present. As water passes through the hypogeal layer, particles of matter are trapped in the mucilaginous matrix and soluble organic material is adsorbed. The contaminants are metabolised by the bacteria, fungi and protozoa.[12] Slow sand filters are typically 1–2 metres deep, and have a hydraulic loading rate of 0.2–0.4 cubic metres per square metre per hour.[13] Filters lose their performance as the biofilm thickens and reduces the rate of flow. The filter is refurbished by removing the biofilm and a thin upper layer of sand. Water is decanted back into the filter and re-circulated to enable a new biofilm to develop. Alternatively wet harrowing involves stirring the sand and flushing the biolayer through for disposal.[13]This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (March 2020) Physio-chemical treatment[edit] (Also referred to as 'conventional treatment'.) Chemical flocculants are used to generate a floc in the water that traps suspended solids. Chemical polyelectrolytes are used to increase coagulation of suspended solids to improve removal.[14]This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (March 2020) This consist of a primary coagulant such as ferric sulfate and a coagulant aid cationic polymer being flash-mixed before it enters a Flocculation Basin. Once the source water being treated has been flash-mixed with a primary coagulant and a polymer, they are then put into some type of flocculation basin, where slow turning or mixing of the water, mixes the chemicals together and they can then form what is called ""floc"" or ""flocc"", which then settles out to the bottom of the floc basin. After the water has mixed and the floc has formed, it is then passed to the next stage which would be the settling basin. Here the process would have either tube settlers or plate settlers. The water would flow up through these tubes or plates, allowing the clear water to flow over into an effluent launder, which would then carry the ""settled"" water to the filters for further treatment. The tubes/plates in the settling stage, allow a greater surface area for the ""floc"" to settle on. These plates are typically at a 30–45° angle, allowing the floc particles to collect in the tubes or the plates and eventually ending up in the bottom of the settling basin. There is typically some sort of sludge collection system that then will collect all of the settled floc a.k.a. sludge, and pump it or transfer the waste to a decant tank or basin, where it is later disposed of. Once the settled water had traveled to the filters, and has made its way through the filters, it is then stored in a clearwell, where all the filtered water gets collected for additional chemical addition: pH adjuster, chlorine or UV light. After the appropriate contact time or kill time, the water leaves the clearwell and heads out to storage tanks or into the distribution, all the way to the customers faucet for use Developing countries[edit] Further information: Self-supply of water and sanitation Appropriate technology options in water treatment include both community-scale and household-scale point-of-use (POU) or self-supply designs.[15] Such designs may employ solar water disinfection methods, using solar irradiation to inactivate harmful waterborne microorganisms directly, mainly by the UV-A component of the solar spectrum, or indirectly through the presence of an oxide photocatalyst, typically supported TiO2 in its anatase or rutile phases.[16] Despite progress in SODIS technology, military surplus water treatment units like the ERDLator are still frequently used in developing countries. Newer military style Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Units (ROWPU) are portable, self-contained water treatment plants are becoming more available for public use.[17] For waterborne disease reduction to last, water treatment programs that research and development groups start in developing countries must be sustainable by the citizens of those countries. This can ensure the efficiency of such programs after the departure of the research team, as monitoring is difficult because of the remoteness of many locations. Energy Consumption: Water treatment plants can be significant consumers of energy. In California, more than 4% of the state's electricity consumption goes towards transporting moderate quality water over long distances, treating that water to a high standard.[18] In areas with high quality water sources which flow by gravity to the point of consumption, costs will be much lower. Much of the energy requirements are in pumping. Processes that avoid the need for pumping tend to have overall low energy demands. Those water treatment technologies that have very low energy requirements including trickling filters, slow sand filters, gravity aqueducts. Regulation[edit] Main article: Drinking water quality standards United States[edit] The Safe Drinking Water Act requires the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to set standards for drinking water quality in public water systems (entities that provide water for human consumption to at least 25 people for at least 60 days a year).[19] Enforcement of the standards is mostly carried out by state health agencies.[20] States may set standards that are more stringent than the federal standards.[21] EPA has set standards for over 90 contaminants organized into six groups: microorganisms, disinfectants, disinfection byproducts, inorganic chemicals, organic chemicals and radionuclides.[22] EPA also identifies and lists unregulated contaminants which may require regulation. The Contaminant Candidate List is published every five years, and EPA is required to decide whether to regulate at least five or more listed contaminants.[23] Local drinking water utilities may apply for low interest loans, to make facility improvements, through the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund.[24] United Kingdom[edit] In the United Kingdom regulation of water supplies is a devolved matter to the Welsh and Scottish Parliaments and the Northern Ireland Assembly. In England and Wales there are two water industry regulatory authorities. Water Services Regulation Authority (Ofwat) is the economic regulator of the water sector; it protects the interests of consumers by promoting effective competition and ensuring that water companies carry out their statutory functions. Ofwat has a management board comprising a Chairman, Chief Executive and Executive and Non-Executive members. There is a staff of about 240.[25] The Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI) provides independent assurance that the privatised water industry delivers safe, clean drinking water to consumers. The DWI was established in 1990 and comprises a Chief Inspector of Drinking Water and a team of about 40 people.[26] The current standards of water quality are defined in Statutory Instrument 2016 No. 614 the Water Supply (Water Quality) Regulations 2016.[27] The functions and duties of the bodies are formally defined in the Water Industry Act 1991 (1991 c. 56) as amended by the Water Act 2003 (2003 c. 37) and the Water Act 2014 (2014 c. 21).[28] In Scotland water quality is the responsibility of independent Drinking Water Quality Regulator (DWQR).[29] In Northern Ireland the Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI) regulates drinking water quality of public and private supplies.[30] The current standards of water quality are defined in the Water Supply (Water Quality) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2017.[31] See also[edit] Agricultural wastewater treatment Control of water pollution Clean Water Act Peak water (water supply & demand) Pulsed-power water treatment Reclaimed water Sewage treatment Wastewater treatment Water purification Water quality Water softening Water supply References[edit] ^ ""Linda Lawton – 11th International Conference on Toxic Cyanobacteria"".

It previously also managed transport services through its subsidiary Veolia Transport (later Transdev) until January 2019. In 2012, Veolia employed 318,376 employees in 48 countries. Its revenue in that year was recorded at €29.4 billion.[3] It is quoted on Euronext Paris. It is headquartered in Aubervilliers.[4] Between 1998 and 2003 the company was known as Vivendi Environnement, having been spun off from the Vivendi conglomerate, most of the rest of which became Vivendi. Prior to 1998 Vivendi was known as Compagnie Générale des Eaux. In 2014, following a major restructuring, the company adopted the unaccompanied Veolia name across its businesses.

In 1853, CGE obtained a concession in order to supply water to the public in Lyon, serving in this capacity for over a hundred years. In 1860, it obtained a 50-year concession with the City of Paris.[5] For a hundred years, Compagnie Générale des Eaux remained largely focused on the water sector. However, following the appointment of Guy Dejouany as CEO in 1976, CGE extended its activities into other sectors with a series of takeovers. Beginning in 1980, CGE began diversifying its operations from water into waste management, energy, transport services, and construction and property. It did so by acquiring:[6] Compagnie générale française des transports et entreprises (CGFTE), created from Compagnie Générale Française de Tramways (CGFT) (originally founded in 1875) in 1953. It was absorbed into CGEA Transport (later Connex).[5][7] Compagnie Générale d'Entreprises Automobiles (CGEA), which specialized in industrial vehicle and later divided into two branches: The transport division became Connex in 1999 and the waste management and environmental services became Onyx Environnement in 1989. CGEA was created in 1912.[8] Compagnie Générale de Chauffe (CGC) (and also later the Montenay group in 1986), with these companies later becoming the Energy Services division of CGE, and later renamed ""Dalkia"" in 1998. CGC was created in 1935.[8] Veolia World Headquarters in Paris, 36–38 Avenue Kléber, Paris 16th arr. In 1998, CGE changed its name to ""Vivendi"", and sold off its property and construction divisions the following year. Vivendi Environnement was formed in 1999 to consolidate its environmental divisions. Its divisions at the formation of Vivendi Environnement were:[6] Vivendi Water (only renamed in 1999) Dalkia (originally CGC and already renamed since 1998) Onyx Environnement (originally part of CGEA and already branded since 1989) Connex (remaining part of CGEA ) Vivendi went on to list on the New York Stock Exchange (as ""V""), and in December, announced a major merger with Canal+ and Seagram, the owner of Universal Studios film company, to become Vivendi Universal and now named Vivendi. In July 2000, Vivendi Environnement was divested through IPOs in Paris and later New York in October 2001). Initially, Vivendi Universal retained a 70% stake in Vivendi Environnement in 2000, but by December 2002, it was reduced to 20.4%.[9] In 2003, Vivendi Environnement was renamed to Veolia Environnement. 2003 – present: Veolia[edit] As a result of Vivendi Environnement spinning off from its parent Vivendi in 2002, in 2003, Vivendi Environnement was renamed to Veolia Environnement.[9] In 2005, the name ""Veolia"" was established as an umbrella brand for all of the Group's divisions (water, environmental services, energy services and transport) and a new logo was created.[9] The names of the divisions at the time of rebranding were: Veolia Water (originally Vivendi Water) Dalkia (no change in name, but became a joint venture with Électricité de France (EDF) in 2000) Veolia Environmental Services (originally Onyx Environnement) Veolia Transport (originally Connex) In November 2009, Antoine Frérot has become the Chairman and the CEO of the Group after succeeding Henri Proglio who has been appointed CEO of Électricité de France. The change has been part of a huge politico-financial scandal in France[10][11] as Proglio kept executive positions – and subsequent salary – in both companies until public criticism forced him to give up his Veolia revenues. Its Veolia Water division remains the largest private operator of water services in the world. In March 2011 the company announced the formation of Veolia Transdev, the result of the combination of its transport subsidiary Veolia Transport with Transdev, a subsidiary of Caisse des Dépôts. Veolia Transdev is the world's private-sector leader in sustainable mobility with more than 110,000 employees in 28 countries.[12] In July 2011, amid disappointing financial results, the company announced the launch of new restructuring plans and redeployment of assets and businesses.[13] In December 2011, Veolia announced a €5bn divestment program over 2012–2013.[14] The company would comprise only three divisions (Water, Environmental Services and Energy Services). The transport businesses Veolia Transdev would be divested. Veolia sold a 20% share of Veolia Transdev (now called Transdev) to Caisse des Dépôts in December 2016 and continued to hold a 30% share.[15] In January 2019, the 30% share was sold to the Rethmann Group, the owner of Rhenus.[16] Operations[edit] Overview[edit] Veolia is established in 48 countries, with employees across the globe in 2012: France: 28% Europe (not including France, Central and Eastern European countries): 23% Central and Eastern Europe countries : 13% China and Asia-Pacific: 12% South America: 10% Africa and Middle-East: 6% North America: 5% The company has 2,573 subsidiaries around the world.[17] Water[edit] Main article: Veolia Water Veolia Water is the world leader in water services. It handles water and wastewater services for clients in the public sector and in various industries. It also creates and constructs the required technology and infrastructure. In 2012, Veolia Water employed 89,094 people and recorded revenue of €12.078 billion[18] 37.2% of its revenue comes from France, 30.2 from other European countries, 8.8% from Americas, 16.2% from Asia and 7.6% from Africa and the Middle East. Veolia Water was renamed from Vivendi Water in 2005, which was renamed from CGE water division in 1999.[6][9] Waste management[edit] Main article: Veolia Environmental Services Veolia Environmental Services operates waste management services around the world, including the treatment of hazardous and non-hazardous liquid and solid waste. It also deals with the collection and recycling of waste. [19] Veolia Environmental Services was originally part of the CGEA, created in 1912 and acquired by CGE in 1980.[8][6] It was renamed to Onyx Environnement in 1989, and then again renamed to Veolia Environmental Services in 2005.[6][9] Energy[edit] In 1998, the energy service division of the CGE, originally the Compagnie Générale de Chauffe/Groupe Montenay prior to 1995, was renamed to Dalkia.[6] It ran the business as a joint venture with Électricité de France (EDF) from 2000 until 2014, when it purchased Dalkia's international operations in full, and EDF bought its French operations.[9][20] The company's services include maintaining and managing heating and cooling systems, making plants more energy efficient, and selecting the most adapted energies. In 2012, Dalkia employed 49,824 employees and recorded revenue of €7.664 billion[21] (France 42%, Continental Europe 24%, Southern Europe 14.5%, Northern Europe 8%, North America 3%, China 1.5%, other countries 7%). In North America, Veolia Energy traded under the Trigen Energy name until February 2011.[22][23] It is the largest operator and developer of efficient district energy (heating, cooling, and cogeneration) systems in North America, located in ten major U.S. cities. It also provides facility operations, energy management, and advisory services. In Latin America, Proactiva was a 50-50 joint venture formed in 1999 between Veolia Environnement and Fomento de Construcciones y Contratas (FCC),[24] until Veolia bought the other 50% share from FCC in 2013.[20] As a result, Veolia now owns 100% of Proactiva. Former operations[edit] Transport[edit] Main articles: Transdev and Veolia Transport Transdev (formerly Veolia Transdev) was formed in 2011 from a merger of Veolia Transport with the old Transdev, a subsidiary of Caisse des Dépôts.[12] Currently, Veolia owns 30% of the company's shares.[15] Prior to the merger, Veolia Transport was the transport division of Veolia. It was originally part of the CGEA, which was acquired in 1980, and the transport division was then renamed Connex in 1999, then finally renamed to Veolia Transport in 2005.[6][9] At the time of merger, Veolia Transport recorded revenues of €7.863 billion in 2011 (For 2010 : Europe 83%, included France 37.1%, North America 13.2%, Asia-Pacific 3.7%). It employed 101,798 people. It worked with public authorities under public-private partnerships to manage public transit systems (buses, trains, metros, ferries, etc.).[25] On 6 December 2011 Veolia Environment, seeking to reduce debt and focus on its core businesses of water, waste and energy, announced that it will eventually sell its share in Veolia Transdev, within a two-year time frame, by when its own activities will have been reorganized. After this announcement, the Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations, for its part, officially reiterated its commitment to Veolia Transdev and its continued support as a shareholder to the group's development.[26] In early 2012 it was reported that Cube Infrastructure, a fund controlled by the French bank Natixis (Groupe BPCE), was likely to acquire about half of Veolia's stake in Transdev. The Caisse des Dépôts would take over the other half.[27] This was later changed in October 2012 to Caisse des Dépôts acquiring 10% of the shares from Veolia.[28] This however was not implemented. In December 2016, CDC finally bought 20% shares from Veolia.[15] As a result, Veolia's share on the company reduced to 30%. This was sold in January 2019, marking Veolia's exit from the transport sector.[16] Financial information[edit] On 31 December 2012, shares in Veolia Environnement were held as follows: 9.3% by Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations (primary shareholder), followed by Groupe Industriel Marcel Dassault (6.3%), Groupama (5.42%), Velo Investissement (4.73%), Électricité de France (4.22%), Veolia Environment (2.73%). Public and other institutional investors the remaining 67.3%.[29] Veolia issued two profit warnings in 2011 and announced plans to quit half of the 77 countries where it does business. It launched a €5 billion ($6.4 billion) fire sale of assets. The company and its top executives were facing the prospect of a U.S. class-action lawsuit in January 2012 over allegations that they made ""misleading"" statements between 2007 and 2011 about its financial well-being. The company, which was described as ""struggling"" by the Financial Times, said that a complaint had been filed against it in New York for violation of U.S. federal securities laws. Veolia's shares were the worst performer on France's CAC 40 index in 2011, falling 60%.[30] The following is a summary of data (in millions of euros):[31][32][33] Financial data in millions of euros Year 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Consolidated revenue 30,078 28,603 24,673 25,245 28,620 31,574 35,765 27,847 28,704 29,647 29,439 Operating income 1,971 1,751 1,617 1,893 2,222 2,461 1,960 1,788 1,982 1,017 1,095 Net income 339 −2,054 125 622 759 928 405 559 558 −489 394 Stakeholder equity N/A 6,300 5,600 N/A N/A 10,191 9,532 10,131 10,804 9,835 9,125 Free cash-flow −1,525 168 694 555 901 906 −1,809 −1,344 409 438 3,673 Net financial debt 13,066 11,804 13,059 13,871 14,674 15,125 16,528 15,128 15,218 14,730 11,283 Staff 271,153 298,498 319,502 336,013 312,590 315,261 331,266 318,376 Stock market data[edit] Data for Veolia Environnement, as listed on the New York Stock Exchange.[34] Market capitalisation on 31 December 2010: $15.27 billion On the Paris Bourse, Veolia Environnement is part of the CAC 40 index of shares. Number of shares outstanding on 31 December 2012: 522,086,849 Market capitalisation on 14 September 2012: €4.98 billion Corporate social responsibility[edit] The company's sustainable development activities are diverse. Because it operates in four sectors with a huge potential impact on the environment, both the risks and opportunities presented by sustainable development activities are substantial. The company's sustainability efforts are furthered by its Foundation and Institute which emphasize innovation and research.[35] The Veolia Foundation[edit] The Veolia Foundation supports non-profit activities related to sustainable development, professional continuous development and the protection of the environment in France and overseas. The Foundation supports projects through financial aid and voluntary services provided by its employees. It also supports emergency relief operations in collaboration with humanitarian organisations.[36] Following the 2010 Haiti earthquake, the Veolia Foundation dispatched 30 tons of emergency supplies (mainly water treatment units) via French Red Cross air transportation. The Foundation also sent Veolia technical experts to provide water to the disaster's victims.[37] Institut Veolia[edit] The Institut Veolia was created in 2001 to provide insights into major global challenges such as climate change, urbanisation and various economic, social and cultural issues related to the environment. The institute is built around a committee that brings together seven experts and an international network of researchers and experts. Its activities include organising conferences and publishing articles and reports.[38] Research and development[edit] As of 31 December 2009, the Group's research and development investments reached €89.8 million (€92.1 million in 2008, €84.6 million in 2007).[citation needed] The Research and Innovation division includes 850 experts and supports around 200 scientific partnerships with private and public organisations. The division focuses on four main issues:[39] Manage and preserve natural resources Control impacts on natural environments Care for health and living environments Develop alternative sources of energy Programmes[edit] Veolia's R&I division has determined nine main development programmes through which a number of research projects are managed:[40] Waste collection, sorting, and beneficial re-use Sustainable city and building management Energy efficiency Environmental and health standards New activities Bioresources Drinking water Wastewater Operating events[edit] West Carrollton plant explosion[edit] On 4 May 2009, a Veolia Environmental Service's plant in West Carrollton, Ohio, United States, exploded. The blast leveled two buildings on the property which were a laboratory and a building that had several 200,000 gallon chemical tanks. This particular plant handles fuel blending among other services. Two workers at the plant were injured in the blast.[41] The explosion caused $50 million in damage to the plant itself. More than a dozen homes up to a mile radius from the blast were also damaged due to the explosion. Fatal accident in Gatlinburg[edit] Two workers died after a catastrophic mechanical failure in April 2011 at a waste water treatment plant in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, United States, owned by the local municipality and operated by Veolia Water. At least 1.5 million gallons of a mix of storm and sewage water were spilled into a nearby river after a sewage-holding wall collapsed.[42] Controversies[edit] Veolia v Lithuania[edit] See also: Corruption in Lithuania In 2017, French company Veolia sued Lithuania in Stockholm arbitration court demanding about 100 million euros in damages.[43] Veolia alleges that Lithuanian government is involved in illegal conduct and that it expropriated Veolia's investments. This is Veolia's second arbitration lawsuit against Lithuania after it sued Lithuania in Washington arbitration court in 2016.[44] Relations with Israel[edit] In February 2011 the Tower Hamlets London Borough Council of the London borough of Tower Hamlets, voted to review its position with Veolia and place no further contracts with it, after claiming that Veolia's work for the Israeli government assisted the ""continued oppression of the Palestinian people"".[45] The Justice and Peace Commission, part of the Catholic Church in England, urged London municipalities to stop doing business with Veolia because of its involvement with illegal settlements.[46] Veolia denied wrongdoing.[47] Palestinian human-rights organization Al-Haq instructed lawyers in the Netherlands to submit a formal objection against the decision of Stadsregio Arnhem Nijmegen, a municipality, to award a public transport concession to Hermes, the Dutch subsidiary of Veolia Transdev. The objection was based on Veolia's involvement in what Al-Haq claims are Israel's violations of international law.[48] In a 2012 interview with the Israeli press, Veolia's Denis Gasquet, senior executive vice president, admitted that Veolia had been under pressure from pro-Palestinian groups in Europe, particularly over the Jerusalem Light Rail. Parties within Veolia had argued that the group was losing tenders as a result, but Gasquest said he did not know of any tenders lost due to Veolia's activities in Israel. He confirmed Veolia's intention to stay in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories, while exiting the transport business.[49] On 1 April 2015, the company announced on its website ""Veolia closes the sale of its activities in Israel.""[50] This was taken by supporters of the BDS (Boycott Divestment and Sanctions) movement to signify a success for their campaigning efforts: ""The sale follows a worldwide campaign against the company’s role in illegal Israeli settlements that cost the firm billions of dollars of lost contracts.""[51] Unpaid internships[edit] Veolia offered unpaid internship positions under the Irish government's JobBridge initiative. This scheme was opposed by left-wing political groups, who claim it amounts to free labour and can cause a claimant who refuses many such offers to fall foul of a provision in the Irish Social Welfare that allows benefits to be withdrawn from unemployed who were fired. Flint water crisis[edit] Main article: Flint water crisis On 22 June 2016, Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette began its first civil action in the Flint water crisis by filing suit against Veolia North America and Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam (LAN) who were hired to consult Flint water plant officials after the switch to the Flint River in April 2015. The lawsuit accuses Veolia and LAN of professional negligence and public nuisance. Veolia is also accused of fraud. Veolia called the accusations ""baseless, entirely unfounded and appears to be intended to distract from the troubling and disturbing realities that have emerged as a result of this tragedy"". And added: ""In fact, when Veolia raised potential lead and copper issues, city officials and representatives told us to exclude it from our scope of work because the city and the EPA were just beginning to conduct lead and copper testing.""[52][53] See also[edit] France portal Companies portal Distributed generation Veolia Transport Water privatization References[edit] ^ a b c d ""Annual Results 2016"" (PDF).

According to the findings of a recent representative survey, almost 80 percent of Germans see the decarbonization of the energy and transport sectors as a collective responsibility. More than half think the transformation is not occurring with sufficient speed. In addition, most view the transformation as too expensive. read more Energy transition Democracy Berlin Shoppers’ Mobility Habits: Retailers Overestimate Car Use Retail traders often fear that reducing the amount of urban space made available for parking private vehicles would have a negative effect on their businesses.

Our research approach is transformative, transdisciplinary, and co-creative: IASS researchers collaborate with diverse actors from science, policymaking and public administration as well as business and civil society to develop a common understanding of sustainability challenges and generate potential solutions. Transformative sustainability research aims to bring together all relevant forms of knowledge generated both within and outside science in order to understand the problems of sustainable development, identify appropriate solutions, and support their implementation in cooperation with relevant actors and affected communities. The IASS involves these stakeholders in its transdisciplinary and co-creative research processes from the outset and does not view them as mere addressees of its research findings. The Institute also discusses its findings with representatives from politics, industry and civil society and supports transformation processes through this kind of consultation. Our research and consultancy activities are organized across five research areas: Systemic Interdependencies; Perceptions, Values, Orientation; Democratic Transformations; Governance for the Environment and Society; and Energy Systems and Societal Change. Our Forums and other activities foster dialogue between science, policymakers and civil society. These activities are complemented by a Fellow Programme, which fosters global dialogue and connects researchers working in the field of transformative research for sustainable development. Our history In 2007 the Nobel Laureate Symposium “Global Sustainability – A Nobel Cause” was held in Potsdam under the patronage of Chancellor Angela Merkel and attended by a host of internationally renowned scientists and political figures. The symposium’s widely regarded outcome document – the Potsdam Memorandum – calls for a joint effort to tap into “all sources of innovation and invention” in an effort to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century and establish a new “global contract” to promote sustainable societies in the age of the Anthropocene. In the wake of the symposium, the German Science Alliance developed a concept for a novel research institute, from which the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies (IASS) emerged. The IASS was officially founded in 2009 as a joint initiative of the German Federal Government, the Federal State of Brandenburg and the research organisations of the German Science Alliance. Potsdam was chosen as the location for the institute due to its excellent research landscape, with world-class institutions such as the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) and the Helmholtz Centre Potsdam – GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences, as well as its close proximity to politics, media, and non-governmental organisations in Berlin. More about us Our Approach The IASS Potsdam was founded in 2009 for the purpose of gathering together all relevant forms of knowledge from science, society and politics in order to initiate and support a transformation towards sustainable development that is grounded in scientific research. read more Structure & Bodies The IASS is a registered association under German law and is made up of a number of institutional and personal members. read more Fellow Programme The Fellow programme at the IASS brings highly qualified people to the Institute, who provide expertise, inspiration, and creative input, but are not directly engaged in the fulfilment or operation of an IASS project. read more The IASS Incubator The Incubator provides a space for innovative ideas, topics, and issues that cannot be addressed within current projects and serves as a means to harvest synergies between different work streams. Societal or political developments may provide interesting opportunities for the creation of Incubator initiatives. Topics may range from important political processes to current events. In addition, the Incubator serves as an “experimental space” in order to test out ideas, new modes of research, and methods. It opens a space for “riskier ventures”, including possibly unsuccessful, but valuable learning experiences. read more Newsletter Stay up to date and subscribe to our bimonthly Newsletter. subscribe to the Newsletter Twitter Youtube Mail Footer Menu Contact & How to find us Events Press Legal Notice Privacy",Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies

The IASS employs a transdisciplinary approach that encourages dialogue to understand sustainability issues and generate potential solutions in cooperation with partners from the sciences, politics, the economy, and civil society. A strong network of national and international partners supports the work of the Institute. Its central research topics include the energy transition, emerging technologies, climate change, air quality, systemic risks, governance and participation, and cultures of transformation in the Anthropocene.[1] Contents 1 Organisation 2 History 3 Publications 4 Cooperation 5 External links 6 Sources Organisation[edit] The IASS currently employs around 120 persons, including Fellows from over 30 countries.[2] In 2019 the Board of Directors was composed of the Institute's three Scientific Directors – Mark G. Lawrence, Patrizia Nanz and Ortwin Renn – and its Head of Administration, Jakob Meyer.[3] The IASS receives funding from the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (85%) and the Federal State of Brandenburg (15%). The Institute's research programme currently spans five areas: Democratic Transformations; Systemic Interdependencies: Nature, Technology, Society; Perceptions, Values, Orientation; Energy Systems and Societal Change; Governance for the Environment and Society. These research areas are supported in their work by a cross-cutting research area tasked with facilitating dialogue between science, policy-makers, and civil society actors.[4] The IASS is a registered voluntary association under German law. The Institute's supervisory, governing, and advisory bodies are its General Assembly, Board of Directors and Advisory Board. History[edit] The IASS was founded in Potsdam, Germany, on 2 February 2009. German politician and environmental policy expert Klaus Töpfer was the Institute's founding director. He led the Institute as its executive director until September 2015, together with scientific directors Carlo Rubbia (June 2010 – May 2015) and Mark G. Lawrence (from October 2011).[5] At a founding symposium held under the patronage of Angela Merkel, the then Federal Minister of Education and Research Annette Schavan stated: ""Under Professor Töpfer's leadership, the Institute will be able to gain international prominence and underscore Germany's strong position in this field."" The idea for the IASS was born in 2007 at the Potsdam Nobel Laureate Symposium ""Global Sustainability – A Nobel Cause"". The symposium brought together leading researchers and decision-makers and resulted in the publication of the widely regarded Potsdam Memorandum, which called for a concerted effort to tap into ""all sources of ingenuity"" to address the challenges of the twenty-first century. The memorandum urged the establishment of a new ""global contract"" between science and society to bring together relevant knowledge within and beyond the science system to meet challenges to sustainability arising in the Anthropocene.[6] Publications[edit] The IASS uses a number of publications formats to disseminate its findings and policy recommendations. These include: IASS Policy Briefs – Policy recommendations and assessments IASS Fact Sheets – Brief overviews of research relating to topics addressed by the Institute IASS Studies – Detailed research findings addressing a central issue IASS Working Paper – Interim research findings and interventions in current debates Other publication formats include articles in scholarly journals, statements, monograhs, and edited volumes. The institute also hosts a blog on its website. Cooperation[edit] The IASS collaborates with numerous partners in Germany and abroad. Its major regional partners include the University of Potsdam, GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences, a research centre operated by the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research, and Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.

The symposium produced the highly regarded Potsdam Memorandum, which calls for a joint effort to tap into “all sources of innovation and invention” to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century. Specifically, it identifies the need for a new “global contract” to increase sustainability in the age of the Anthropocene. From this starting point, representatives of the German Science Alliance developed a concept for a novel research institute in 2008, from which the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies (IASS) emerged. The IASS was officially founded in 2009 as a joint initiative of the German Federal Government, the Federal State of Brandenburg and the research organisations of the German Science Alliance. Potsdam was chosen as the location for the institute due to its excellent research landscape with world-class research institutions such as the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) and the Helmholtz Centre Potsdam - GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences, as well as its close proximity to politics, media and non-governmental organisations in Berlin. In its research the IASS aims to merge all relevant types of knowledge – both within and outside science – in order to jointly find solutions that help us initiate, support and scientifically accompany the transformation to sustainable development. In accordance with its mission, the IASS involves a wide range of stakeholders from all parts of society in a transdisciplinary process with the goal of developing solutions, and it does not view these stakeholders as mere addressees of the institute’s findings at the end of the research process. Our transdisciplinary research processes are based on excellent disciplinary and interdisciplinary research; at the same time, the questions they raise and the results they produce feed into such research. The IASS does not merely work to create the knowledge needed for action; it also discusses its findings with representatives of politics, industry and civil society and furthers the transformation process through this kind of consultation.

It is widely recognised that secure and equitable rights to land and natural resources are central to this effort. Land rights empower people and provide a sense of dignity. They enhance food security and are fundamental to achieve the right to food and increase the productivity of small-scale food producers. They provide an incentive for ecosystem stewardship, and they promote inclusive and equitable societies whilst underpinning cultures and value systems.

This is evidenced by the analysis of the role soils play across the proposed agenda. However, some key aspects have not been sufficiently considered so far. Moreover, the SDGs will place increased demand on soils. Further advocacy is therefore needed to ensure that important soil and land related issues remain in the final declaration of the post-2015 agenda.

The standards vary by certifying agency or organization but address issues such as management plans, protection of resource values, harvesting and management practices, social/economic issues and monitoring. The evaluation is often performed by a third party and, if successful, result in a ""certificate"" of compliance to the particular standards. The certificate, and accompanying labels or signs, demonstrates to the public, neighbors, consumers and markets that the landowner practices sustainable forest management. How did Forest Certification Arise? Concerns about tropical deforestation in the 1980s led various environmental organizations, universities, forestry and natural resource agencies, standards organziations and other partners to initiate the development of international standards of sustainability for forest management. Starting with tropical forests and later applied to temperate forests, these standards are the foundation of the forest certification systems operating today. There are currently four certification systems operating in the South: the American Tree Farm System (ATFS), the Forest Stewardship Program (FSP), the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) and Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). The Forest Stewardship Program is a federal and state-sponsored system, while nongovernment organizations manage the other three. Benefits and Costs of Certification Benefits The most commonly cited benefits for landowners are market access, credibility, forest management assistance and educational opportunities and networking with other landowners and forestry and natural resource professionals. A key assumption of the some certification programs has been that consumers will show a preference for products from certified forests and, in turn, certified wood will gain a price premium in the marketplace. However, demand for certified products has not been as strong in North America as in Western Europe. Some specialty products such as flooring, cabinetry, and musical instruments have cited small premiums due to the marketing of their products as certified. Overall, consumer concerns about forest management is increasing and a number of large retail companies and major businesses have implemented purchasing policies that require at least partial sourcing or selling of certified wood and paper products. To meet this demand, mills are purchasing larger portions of certified wood. This is providing certified landowners with an opportunity for easier market access than uncertified forests. A second potential benefit from certification is assurance that you are managing your property in the most sustainable way possible. A third-party audit provides a system for validating sustainable management claims. This may assure public agencies as well as the general public that the landowner is engaged in long-term forest management. Although not a widespread practice at this time, participation in one of the certification programs has been proposed, and in some cases adopted, in several local ordinances or land development regulations in the South as a qualification for particular land uses. Third, forest management is often improved through the technical expertise from natural resource professionals used to develop, implement and monitor plans. That expertise often includes other disciplines such as wildlife professionals and hydrologists. Increased participation in outreach activities can also improve management and planning. For example, ATFS and FSP participants may tap into educational opportunities such as websites, newsletters, conferences and other events organized by state ATFS or FSP committees. By participating in a third party assessment, a participant may use the results as an opportunity to improve the overall management system of the forest. Costs Direct costs, such as a management plan and the field audit vary greatly among the systems. For example, ATFS and FSP provide free assessment audits while FSC and SFI audits usually require auditor fees and expenses. ATFS relies on volunteer foresters and FSP relies on state forestry and wildlife agencies for the certification process. On a per acre basis, direct costs will generally increase as ownership size decreases and may vary from less than one dollar/acre to many dollars per acre. Certification Programs in the South American Tree Farm System The American Tree Farm System (ATFS) was created in 1941 with the designation of the first tree farm in Montesano, Washington. At that time, there was concern by industry that private nonindustrial forestlands (NIPFs) were being harvested at unsustainable levels and little effort was being made regarding reforestation. To prevent deforestation and wood shortages for the mills, Tree Farm was created by the forest products industry to help ensure a continuous flow of wood from nonindustrial forestlands. Their system required a professional forester to visit the site and verify that the landowner had a written plan addressing the management of the wood and regeneration protocols for after the harvest, while addressing water, soil, wildlife and recreation concerns. The intent of the program was to certify tree farms that could serve a demonstration to other landowners of the benefits of scientific forestry. Today the American Tree Farm System is a network of 74,000 family forest owners sustainably managing 20.5 million acres of forestland. ATFS is the largest and oldest sustainable woodland certification system in the United States, internationally recognized, meeting strict third-party certification standards. Wood coming from certified ATFS forests is a part of the Sustainable Forestry Initiative chain of custody from the woods to the consumer. The not-for-profit American Forest Foundation administers the ATFS nationally. In each state participating in the ATFS certification program, a state Tree Farm Committee provides statewide leadership and promotion of the Tree Farm program and certification. Forest Stewardship Program The Forest Stewardship Program (FSP) was created in 1990 under the 1990 Farm Bill. The Stewardship Program was developed as an attempt to reach out to the largest constituent of forestland owners, the nonindustrial private forestland owner, specifically those who did not have a management plan. The program aims to assist these landowners in maintaining their forestland in a productive and healthy condition for both present and future users by following a multiple use philosophy. This is accomplished by providing technical and financial support from state forestry agencies and other partners to assist in management planning. The program brings public and/or private natural resource professionals together with landowners to develop and implement forest stewardship plans. By helping professional foresters to reach NIPFs, the US Forest Service strives to increase the use of sound forest practices, thereby improving the forestry image as a whole. While not a forest product certification program, owners of certified Stewardship Forests receive a sign to display at their property and are recognized by their state Forest Stewardship Program Steering Committee. State forestry agencies are responsible for implementing and certifying stewardship forests. Forest Stewardship Council The creation of the Forest Stewardship Council was prompted by the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development of 1992, known as the ""Rio Earth Summit"". This conference was convened to address global issues such as climate change, land use change, and present and potential effects of development on the environment. The world’s most influential government leaders, policy makers, non-government organizations, and industrial representatives attended. This was the first time that international forestry issues were discussed internationally at such a large scale. After the Earth Summit, there was widespread discourse over the failure of the governments to develop an international forest convention that they believed would help curb the destruction of the rainforests. The NGOs were desperate for a change and they turned towards the markets to help develop a solution to their problem. In 1993, the Rainforest Alliance, an NGO based out of New York, teamed up with the World Wildlife Fund, several small logging companies, foresters and sociologists, and created the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). The FSC develops the principles and standards for its certification program and then accredits certifying agencies worldwide to certify forests. In the United States FSC certification is administered by one of two certifying agencies; the Smartwood Program and Scientific Certification Systems. These two agencies develop or utilize regional performance measures based on the principles and criteria of FSC International. These measures are approved by the FSC-US, the United States initiative of FSC international, which is headquartered in Bonn, Germany. Sustainable Forestry Initiative Sustainable Forest Initiative (SFI) Inc. is an independent, nonprofit organization that is solely responsible for maintaining, overseeing and improving the internationally recognized Sustainable Forestry Initiative® (SFI®) program. Across Canada and the United States,  280 million acres (110 million hectares) are certified to the SFI forest management standard, the largest single forest standard in the world. The SFI program's unique fiber sourcing requirements promote responsible forest management on all suppliers' lands. SFI chain-of-custody (COC) certification tracks the percentage of fiber from certified forests, certified sourcing and post-consumer recycled content. SFI on-product labels identify both certified sourcing and COC claims to help consumers make responsible purchasing decisions. SFI Inc. is governed by a three-chamber board of directors representing environmental, social and economic sectors equally.

202,"Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy - Wikipedia Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search The historic Caroline Crosby House, 2105 First Avenue South, Minneapolis. Now home to the IATP. The Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy (IATP) is a non-profit research and advocacy organization that promotes sustainable food, farm, and trade systems. IATP has offices in Minneapolis, Minnesota and Geneva, Switzerland, and operates both locally and internationally. Contents 1 Areas of work 2 Timeline highlights 3 History 4 References 5 External links Areas of work[edit] IATP works to integrate sustainability throughout the food and farm system, from supporting farmers and the environment to securing universal access to healthy food. IATP identifies the impact trade agreements have on farmers, consumers and the environment, while promoting a fair trade system that supports locally based development, labor and human rights, and democratic institutions. IATP develops alternative economic models that integrate environmental sustainability into rural development. Timeline highlights[edit] 1987: IATP launches the Sustainable Agriculture Computer Network with email, access to shared data and research, news wire services, electronic conferencing and bulletin boards.[1] 1990: IATP distributes Trading Away Our Future, a video on how General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) affects American agriculture policy, to over 1,000 local organizers, opinion leaders and teachers. 1991: In New York, IATP conducts trainings and strategy coordination for 20 coalition partners in preparation for the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. 1992: United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, more commonly known as the Earth Summit, meets in Rio de Janeiro; IATP co-hosts the Global Forum on the GATT at the summit. 1995: IATP holds a series of events nationwide with surviving founders of Bretton Woods and United Nations institutions, resulting in a [book of twenty essays] by the participants.[2] 1996: IATP forms Peace Coffee in partnership with Guatemala’s Nobel Peace Prize winner Rigoberta Menchú.[3] 1997: IATP incorporates TransFair USA,[4] the first U.S. fair-trade certification body.[5] 1998: IATP marks the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights with an event in New York City with Jesse Jackson, John Sweeney and others.[6] 2000: With six other groups, IATP launches Genetically Engineered Food Alert to challenge the use of genetically engineered crops in food.[7][8] IATP launches Trade Information Project in Geneva to serve as an information clearinghouse on the World Trade Organization (WTO) for NGOs around the world. 2001: IATP created the Eat Well Guide, an online directory of sustainably raised meat, poultry, dairy and eggs available from North American farms, stores, restaurants and online merchants.[9] 2005: IATP publishes a critique of the U.S. food aid system for undercutting local food systems in poor countries. The WTO holds its sixth ministerial in Hong Kong.[10] IATP helps to organize the Fair Trade Fair and Symposium near the WTO meeting, to highlight the fair trade system for WTO delegates. 2006: IATP publishes a report, summarized in The New York Times, on the incidence of arsenic in U.S. poultry products.[11] 2008: John Nichols of The Nation designated IATP the ""Most Valuable Policy Group"" in his Most Valuable Progressives of 2008 list.[12] The Food and Society Fellows program moves to IATP, bringing together chefs, farmers, nutritionists, activists, public health professionals, fishers, policy experts and academics who work to create sustainable food systems. 2009: IATP released a report, Not So Sweet: Missing Mercury and High Fructose Corn Syrup, that examined the presence of mercury in high fructose corn syrup.[13][14] History[edit] Minnesota Secretary of State Mark Ritchie returned to the United States from a 1986 Geneva meeting and incorporated the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy[15] as a nonprofit, tax-exempt organization, with the mission of fostering sustainable rural communities. In 1987, IATP began to organize and report on the newly launched round of international trade negotiations being conducted by the GATT, which eventually became the WTO. The rules of agricultural trade set in the GATT[16] and implemented at the WTO have deeply influenced national and local farm policies around the globe over the last two decades. In the 1990s, IATP expanded beyond its initial focus on international policymaking institutions like the WTO, and regional free trade agreements like the North American Free Trade Agreement, to include the promotion of positive alternatives to economically, socially and environmentally destructive agricultural and trade practices. For example, with the Center for Agriculture and the Environment in the Netherlands, IATP developed tools to help U.S. farmers increase their income by reducing on-farm fertilizer use. Jim Harkness became IATP’s new president in 2006, after spending the previous 16 years in China, most recently as the Executive Director for the World Wildlife Fund in China. In 2014, Juliette Majot became the organization's third President, changing the title to Executive Director.

(California Academy of Sciences © Kathryn Whitney) (California Academy of Sciences © Kathryn Whitney) 0 SAN FRANCISCO (November 10, 2020) – The California Academy of Sciences has joined a newly formed coalition of organizations dedicated to protecting California’s world-renowned natural heritage. The California Biodiversity Network aspires to bring together scientific institutions, conservation organizations, tribal governments, museums, and educators to conduct research in support of biodiversity protection, coordinate conservation efforts, and train tomorrow’s environmental leaders. The network is a key part of California’s strategy to preserve the state’s unique biodiversity and combat the climate crisis. Thanks to its wide variety of climates, soils, and geography, California is home to more species of plants and animals than any other state, accounting for roughly a third of all species found in the nation. But habitat loss, invasive species, changing climate, and a reduction in water supplies pose imminent threats to these natural riches. ""Meaningful progress in the fight to address climate change and biodiversity losses can occur only through deep, cross-sector collaboration,” says the Academy's Executive Director Scott Sampson, PhD. “The California Biodiversity Network has potential to become a global model for how to engage in this critical work, and the Academy is proud to help lead the way."" Last month, California Governor Gavin Newsom issued an executive order directing the state’s Natural Resources Agency to consult with stakeholders to guide California’s climate and conservation work. The governor’s order also commits California to achieve protection for 30 percent of the state by 2030. California now joins 38 countries in this ambitious global effort. The California Biodiversity Network—which will help develop strategies to achieve the “30 by 30” goal—includes founding partners at natural history museums such as the Academy, land trusts and conservancies such as Pepperwood Preserve, the National Park Service, California State Parks, and the University of California. Network members will look for opportunities to engage with local communities to frame more inclusive pathways toward a sustainable future. In addition to advising state actions on biodiversity conservation, network members are committed to building an equitable network for conservation leaders. “Our mission is not just to advise on the science but also to help train the next generation of environmental conservationists,” says Peggy Fiedler, executive director of the UC Natural Reserve System and a cofounder of the network. “We’re thrilled to share and build upon our 167-year history of research in California, carefully documenting its natural history and changing ecosystems,” says Shannon Bennett, PhD, the Academy’s Chief of Science. “By expanding our California-focused research with new and existing community collaborations, we can further document and better protect the life and landscapes we love.” Network partners will utilize their technical expertise and resources in various ways to help protect biodiversity. Museums like the Academy will leverage their collections to assess the state’s baseline biodiversity, and will invite the public to contribute their own wildlife observations through iNaturalist, the world’s most popular citizen science app co-powered by the Academy and National Geographic. As a global leader in citizen science, the Academy mobilizes these crowdsourced data for greater collective impact by organizing Snapshot Cal Coast, co-organizing the City Nature Challenge (which swept 244 cities worldwide last year), and helping to lead other community campaigns such as California Biodiversity Day, an initiative inviting all Californians to make and share nature observations to further critical research on how wildlife is changing. The network also hopes to partner with California Tribal Nations, whose knowledge and expertise from stewarding nature for time immemorial is critical to this work—past, present, and future. Together, members of the California Biodiversity Network will look for opportunities to incorporate traditional land management practices into policies that foster ecosystem health. Scientists will research how ecosystems respond to stressors linked to climate change, often analyzing large, crowd-sourced datasets to advise the state on conservation decisions. Academy scientists in particular will leverage existing monitoring partnerships that respond to marine mammal strandings along the California coast, track shifting species ranges in the state’s Marine Protected Areas, and document how forest ecosystems in the Sierra Nevada respond to fire. The Academy will also draw from core research on the diversity of California wildlife—from native wildflowers to scorpions to deep-sea corals—to help further the shared goals of the network. The Academy looks forward to furthering its work at the intersection of conservation and community engagement through the network’s emerging partnerships across the state. To see California’s natural wonders in a new way, journey outside with iNaturalist as your mobile-app guide to wildlife observations, or step into the Academy’s Giants of Land and Sea exhibit, which celebrates the scientists and communities taking action every day to sustain our state’s extraordinary biodiversity.

Based in the Philippines, it is engaged with the wider international climate and energy policy arena, particularly in Asia. It is recognized for its role in helping advance effective global climate action and the Paris climate agreement. Formerly known as Green Renewable Independent Power Producer, a sustainable energy solutions initiative first formed in 1998, the organization was renamed to reflect its broader agenda, covering climate policy, low carbon resilience, climate finance, communications, and diplomacy in international, national, and local arenas. ClimateEnergyInnovationClimate Climate Fighting for 1.5ºC with frontliners ICSC promotes fair climate policy globally as an advisor to the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) and the Vulnerable 20 Group of Finance Ministers (V20), composed of 48 of the world’s most vulnerable countries. The Philippines chaired the CVF and V20 respectively from December 2014 to August 2016. The organization is also an accredited observer to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and an advisor to the Philippine delegation to the UN climate negotiations. In addition, the Institute is the convenor of Aksyon Klima Pilipinas, a nationwide coalition of over 40 civil society groups working on diverse climate and development issues. It is also the chair of CENTRE, a network of renewable energy (RE) experts, developers, advocates, and enterprises, and co-convenor of Philippine Commission on Women’s (PCW) Technical Working Group on the Environmental Conservation, Protection And Rehabilitation dimension of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. Mobilizing and tracking climate finance ICSC provides climate policy, finance, and energy advocacy and strategy development advice to civil society organizations (CSOs) and networks in Asia and Africa. It is a convenor of GCF Watch, a Southern civil society-led initiative established to help empower civil society groups from the Global South to engage the Fund more effectively. ICSC is the convenor of the global Adaptation Finance Accountability Initiative (AFAI), an international research initiative tracking how climate finance, committed by donor countries and organizations, has been received and utilized by recipient countries such as the Philippines. The Institute was the Philippine lead when the global initiative was established in 2013, and when it closed in 2015, ICSC not only sustained the initiative but also established AFAI+, adding mitigation finance in the list of funds tracked. Through AFAI+, ICSC continues to promote new tracking and monitoring tools to improve climate finance transparency and accountability in the Philippines and in the Global South region. The organization is a critical voice in the development of climate finance policy in the Philippines. It led the crafting and passage into law of the People’s Survival Fund (PSF) in 2012, the first legislated Philippine climate finance mechanism dedicated to supporting local adaptation initiatives. ICSC currently sits as a civil society representative to the PSF Board and continues to support local governments, communities and organizations in developing local adaptation plans and budgets. Understanding climate impacts ICSC works with scientists and local academic institutions to surface the creeping impacts of climate change in the country, more formally known as slow onset events (SOEs), associated with the adverse impacts of climate change. These impacts include sea level rise, increasing temperatures, ocean acidification, salinization, and land and forest degradation. In 2015, the organization launched the report “Slow Onset Climate Change Impacts: What it is, Why should we care, and What we can do about it” with the Congressional Policy Budget and Research Department (CPBRD) of the of the House of Representatives of the Philippines. The report highlighted that SOEs might not currently be as evident as rapid onset events, such as super typhoons and other extreme weather events, but can be just as deadly. The report also called for more research on SOEs and discussions among not just scientists and academics but also policymakers and even the wider public. ICSC continued its SOE research work by partnering with researchers from Benguet State University (BSU), Visayas State University (VSU), and University of Southeastern Philippines (USEP) to undertake desk reviews of local SOE studies in Benguet province, within the Cordillera Administrative Region, the Eastern Visayas Region (Region VIII), and Davao Region (Region XI), respectively. As a result, a briefer was released showing how findings from local science-based studies can further show the magnitude of the consequences of SOEs, as well as the need to implement more innovative adaptation measures to reduce these impacts. The report was formally launched at a forum ICSC co-organized with the German Development Institute and the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation last November 2017 on the sidelines of the UN climate conference in Bonn, Germany. The organization is currently expanding its SOE research work. Energy Energy ICSC is at the forefront of promoting real competition in the power sector, sustainable energy, and low carbon resilient development. ICSC’s energy policy team is composed of some of the leading minds in energy economics and regulatory issues in the country. The organization is engaged directly with the Energy Regulatory Commission, the Department of Energy, the Department of Finance, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, the Philippine Senate Power Committee, the Mindanao Development Authority and several local government units in support of policy development promoting the early transition to affordable, sustainable, reliable, and efficient energy systems. It has released groundbreaking reports on small island grids and stranded coal plant assets, and has led the campaign to pass a coal tax in the Philippines last 2017. Last year, ICSC co-organized dialogues with the finance and energy departments on a proposed economy-wide carbon tax and the cost effectiveness of maximum RE penetration in Mindanao energy plan, respectively. ICSC works with the Cooperative Insurance System of the Philippines (1CISP) to advance a learning program to better engage the cooperatives sector in renewable energy. CREATE>LEADS, or the Cooperatives in Renewable Energy and Transformative Economies Leadership and Advocacy School, is a pilot training program for leaders of select cooperatives from Metro Manila, which aims to develop robust business cases that can more quickly bring renewable energy to their members. During its early days, ICSC developed alternative RE programs for on-grid and off-grid communities in the province of Negros Occidental. It eventually launched the country’s first 27-strong electric public vehicle fleet known as e-jeepneys to international acclaim in 2007 as part of the the Amsterdam-based, Doen Foundation-supported Climate-Friendly Cities initiative. The e-jeepney project has received numerous distinctions, among them is the top prize in Discovery Channel’s Ecopolis Program as “the best transport alternative that can save the world’s cities from pollution.” It also won the Grand Prize in the Inclusive Mobility Challenge project of the Rockefeller Foundation, the Ateneo School of Government and the Metro Manila Development Authority. Innovation Innovation RE-Charge Pilipinas In 2014, ICSC set up RE-Charge Pilipinas (RCP) in Tacloban City, ground zero of Super Typhoon Haiyan, as a training center for RE applications and sustainable solutions. It aims to show how RE can better power disaster response and rehabilitation and low carbon development. Powered by a 9.75-kilowatt solar power system, the facility is located within Tacloban’s commercial district, near the city’s port. RCP has since launched two initiatives which aimed to dismantle the myths that all renewable energy systems are technologically sophisticated, expensive and suited only for men. The Solar Scholars program was initiated in 2014 to help community members, local government officials, and civil society representatives harness solar power for emergency response and community development initiatives. They are trained to do energy assessments in their households and communities, as well as set up, operate and maintain portable solar-powered devices called TekPak for emergency lighting and powering of basic communication and medical equipment. Several versions of the TekPaks have been developed, informed by feedback from the communities. At present, the TekPaks are formed using locally available parts, and assembled by a community of RE enthusiasts, interns, volunteers, and Solar Scholars under the guidance of the RCP staff. As of November 2018, ICSC has trained 300 Solar Scholars from the provinces of Samar, Leyte, Eastern Samar, Iloilo, Rizal, Laguna, and Cagayan. ICSC also convened the RE-Serve Humanitarian Corps, a volunteer group trained to provide solar power to humanitarian and emergency responders. The Corps are composed of responders from various local government units, humanitarian organizations, student organizations, and other community groups. Two RE-Serve members, who are also Haiyan survivors, led a Solar Scholars training for Cagayan locals, over a month after Typhoon Mangkhut struck the region in 2018. A few months after, an all-women team from the Corps facilitated a solar scholars training and community evacuation drill in Marabut, Samar, commemorating the fifth anniversary of Haiyan’s landfall. Apart from that, RCP also launched the RE-Hub, a community resource center on renewable energy and sustainable solutions in their facility in Tacloban City. The RE-Hub is a venue for inquiries about appropriate RE systems to address household and community needs of residents. It is also a place for renewable energy technology providers to showcase their products and services. Earlier in 2018, ICSC partnered with the locals of Suluan Island, Guiuan, Eastern Samar, which the province has proclaimed as its Renewable Island Capital, to launch the Small Island Grid Electrification (SIGE) Sulu-an project with the aim of providing power for their households. The island barangay, which has never been connected to the main grid, is pushing for a hybrid solar and diesel island grid project that will power the development of Suluan Island into a prime ecotourism destination and major agro-fishing hub in Eastern Samar. In addition, RCP, along with its consultants, interns, and volunteers, continues to innovate and test renewable energy systems such as the electric jeepneys, solar-powered water pumps, solar cooking stoves, wind turbines, and monitoring systems, as well as their potential applications for households, livelihoods and communities. Agam In 2014, ICSC published what may be the world’s first literary anthology on climate change composed of 26 images and 24 narratives in verse and prose in eight languages. “Agam: Filipino Narratives on Uncertainty and Climate Change” received the National Book Award in December 2015 and in 2016 received the Book Development Association of the Philippines’ Golden Book Award for Literature in English and the Special Award for Design. The book has been launched in 5 cities across the Philippines as well as in Washington DC, New York, Denver, California, and Berlin.

GO Clean Transportation and Mobility CLEAN TRANSPORTATION AND MOBILITYIncreasing access to clean transportation options is not just about protecting the environment. A person’s commute time is the most critical factor in their chances of escaping poverty. An equitable transportation system must be designed to not only improve mobility, but also decrease pollution and  enhance economic opportunities -- particularly for low-income communities of color.""A person’s commute time is the most critical factor in their chances of escaping poverty.” Harvard University ELECTRIC CARS AND TRUCKS: CHARGING AHEADWHY WE’RE INVOLVEDExhaust from cars and trucks contributes to climate change, makes tens of thousands of Californians sick and costs us billions in avoidable health costs, with the worst effects often felt in low-income communities of color. Oil dependence means Californians have no place to turn when gas prices rise – which hurts low income families most. Electric cars and trucks can play a big part in solving these problems – if the people who need them can access them.California boosts the market for electric cars, trucks, and buses by providing incentives, grants, carsharing, vanpool programs, and subsidizing the deployment of charging stations and upgrades to the electric grid. We work to ensure that all our communities – not just the wealthy – benefit from electric vehicles.How are we doing this?Greenlining was among the first to shine a spotlight on the obstacles to widespread adoption of electric cars and trucks in communities of color in our 2011 report, “Electric Vehicles: Who’s Left Stranded?” And we were part of a historic settlement between the California Public Utilities Commission and NRG Energy Inc., intended to make these clean vehicles more accessible in low-income communities. Through a series of landmark reports, we have helped build momentum for electric carsharing in underserved communities, ensuring that electric vehicles are available and affordable to all, and increased use of electric trucks and buses.But that wasn’t nearly enough, so in 2014 Greenlining worked with the Coalition for Clean Air, Communities for a Better Environment, Environment California, and the Natural Resources Defense Council to pass Senate Bill 1275, the Charge Ahead California Initiative, introduced by Sen. Kevin de León (D – Los Angeles). As part of the Charge Ahead California campaign, we are now shaping implementation of this law, which aims to bring one million electric cars, trucks and buses to California by 2023. SB 1275 is creating programs to increase mobility and bring access to electric vehicle technology to low-income communities of color hit hardest by pollution and poverty and who often lack good transportation options.EV Equity ProgramsSB 1275 directs the California Air Resources Board to create equity programs that increase access to and use of electric vehicles among low- and moderate-income individuals.CARB now funds the following projects:Electric carsharing programs in disadvantaged communitiesLow-income EV financing assistance programs (learn how this program helped Kendra Tramiel)Vouchers for replacing gas-guzzling “clunkers” with new or used electric cars or with vouchers for transit and carsharing (learn about how this is helping families in the Central Valley)Low and moderate income rebates within the Clean Vehicle Rebate Project (CVRP)One-Stop-Shop to streamline and improve access to clean transportation-related incentivesClean technology vanpools for agricultural workers in the Central ValleyWe continuously work with our Charge Ahead California campaign partners to secure state funding for these EV equity programs, promote their benefits and successes, and ensure their design and implementation eliminates barriers and maximizes electric vehicle access.  EV Charging InfrastructureElectric car and truck users urgently need convenient access to charging, and this continues to be a large barrier for working families. That’s why in 2015 we became involved in three utility applications at the California Public Utilities Commission seeking approval for deployment of over 90,000 charging ports throughout California --  successfully bringing charging stations to disadvantaged neighborhoods in settlements with San Diego Gas and Electric, Southern California Edison, and Pacific Gas and Electric. Although the CPUC scaled down these pilots, our advocacy helped secure a minimum of 1,625 electric vehicle charging stations in disadvantaged and low-income communities throughout California—the single largest deployment of its kind. We participate in advisory committees for all three pilot programs to ensure that they meet the needs of low-income and disadvantaged communities.We continue to advocate for equitable charging station investments at the CPUC, where utilities proposed $1 billion in transportation electrification projects in January of 2017, and at the California Energy Commission which awarded a grant to invest up to $200 million in electric vehicle charging station programs through 2022. MOBILITY EQUITYWHY WE’RE INVOLVEDWhile electric cars help to reduce pollution, they cannot fix all of our transportation problems. Electric cars still contribute to congestion and auto-centric cities, while car ownership remains a financial burden for low-income households. We recognized that we needed a way to determine how electric vehicles fit into the wider mobility space.Today there are a multitude of new mobility technologies and services available -- such as bikeshare, scootershare, carshare, Uber, and autonomous vehicles. Unfortunately, these mobility services often fail to benefit low-income communities of color -- and in some cases disproportionately harm them. We observed that despite so many new mobility options available today, no mechanism existed to assess which options are the most equitable, sustainable, or best meet community-identified mobility needs. HOW ARE WE DOING THIS?In order to develop a more comprehensive transportation strategy, we expanded our work into mobility -- with the goal of moving more people, not more cars. In 2018 we published the Mobility Equity Framework -- a tool to assess and compare various mobility options on measures of equity in a way that actually reflects the needs and voices of the community. Since then we have been working with local, regional, and state government to adopt elements of the framework across various policies and programs.For years, we have engaged with CARB staff to think beyond funding just personal electric vehicles and embrace clean mobility projects that include people who don’t want or need to own a car -- projects like electric vehicle carshare, bikeshare, microtransit, and more. CARB has listened, and now funds the following projects in underserved communities:Clean Mobility Options in SchoolsClean Mobility Options in Disadvantaged CommunitiesSustainable Transportation Equity ProjectAs the field of self-driving cars has rapidly evolved, in 2019 we released  Autonomous Vehicle Heaven or Hell?, laying out how to make this mobility technology work for underserved communities -- and how to avoid harming them.In 2019 we published the Making Equity Real in Mobility Pilots toolkit, which provides a roadmap for how cities and mobility companies can operationalize equity within a pilot project in an inclusive, culturally appropriate way.  RESOURCESOur report, ""Sustaining Clean Mobility Equity Programs"" explore several ways that clean mobility equity programs may be able to generate and sustain the funding needed to continue their operation.Our playbook, ""Clean Mobility Equity: A Playbook, Lessons From California's Clean Transportation Programs"" reviews California’s clean mobility equity programs, noting successes, pitfalls and areas for improvement.Our toolkit, “Making Equity Real in Mobility Pilots” lays out four steps to embed equity into the mission, process, implementation, and evaluation of a pilot project.Our report, “Autonomous Vehicle Heaven or Hell?” analyzes the impact of self-driving cars on marginalized communities and provides a wide range of policy recommendations to maximize equity outcomes.Our resource, the “Mobility Equity Framework” is a step-by-step guide to assess and compare various mobility options on measures of equity in a way that reflects the needs and voices of the community. Our report, “Delivering Opportunity: How Electric Buses and Trucks Can Create Jobs and Improve Public Health in California,” developed in partnership with Union of Concerned Scientists, describes how the electrification of trucks and buses can improve public health, cut global warming emissions, and create jobs and training in communities most in need.  Our resource, “Electric Vehicles for All: An Equity Toolkit,” is used by advocates and electric vehicle stakeholders in California and other states to ensure EV policies and programs help low-income communities of color access EVs.Our report, “Electric Carsharing in Underserved Communities: Considerations for Program Success,” has helped shape pilot programs to provide electric vehicle carsharing services to poor communities in order to increase mobility and drive adoption of electric cars.

You can’t pave over the whole country.” – U.S. House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman Peter DeFazio (D-OR)1 Global climate change is an existential threat to human civilization. Greenhouse gas (GHG) levels in the atmosphere are higher now than at any other time in the past 4 million years.2 Beginning in 2016, the transportation sector surpassed electricity generation to become the largest source of GHGs in the United States3—and within transportation, surface transportation is the biggest emitter, releasing 1.6 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalents each year.4 If the U.S. surface transportation sector were a country, it would be the fifth-largest emitter on Earth, ranking just ahead of Japan.5 Simply stated, this is unsustainable. The United States must adopt policies and make investments to achieve net-zero GHG emissions by midcentury. Related White Elephant Watch: Vol. 7 Infrastructure Investment Decisions Are Political, Not Technical There are two key strategies for decarbonizing the transportation sector: electrifying vehicles and reducing the automobile dependence of communities. Both are essential. President Joe Biden’s excellent American Jobs Plan includes billions of dollars to modernize American manufacturing to speed the transition to electric vehicle (EV) production.6 The plan also calls for big investments in EV charging infrastructure, renewable energy generation and transmission, and incentives for consumers to purchase zero-emission vehicles. Rapid electrification of transportation powered by renewable energy is urgently needed. In addition to electrification, the federal government needs to substantially reform its transportation policies to reduce auto dependence by directing funds to projects that expand transportation choice—including transit, biking, and walking—and encourage infill development. For example, Congress should pass the Investing in a New Vision for the Environment and Surface Transportation (INVEST) in America Act, which tackles issues both within the current transportation system and stemming from climate change. Taken together, more mobility choice and denser land use would reduce both the frequency and distance of trips made by driving alone. Moreover, these changes would significantly reduce the pace of new development on greenfield land, which provides essential environmental services, including absorbing CO2, providing wildlife habitat, and mitigating flood risks, among other critical services. Climate change cannot be addressed without reforming land use, and land use cannot be changed without reforming transportation. In addition to electrification, the federal government needs to substantially reform its transportation policies to reduce auto dependence by directing funds to projects that expand transportation choice—including transit, biking, and walking—and encourage infill development. Transportation systems, land use, and travel choice Policymakers often overlook the extent to which the transportation system influences individual transportation choices—and, by extension, total driving and land use. According to the Federal Highway Administration, Americans drove a stunning 3.2 trillion miles in the 12-month period ending in January 2020.7 This number is often treated as a natural state of affairs, but in reality, it is the result of decades of policy choices that have locked most Americans into driving to meet their daily mobility needs. How states and regions design their transportation systems has important implications for not only driving and mobile emissions but also the economic productivity of those facilities and the long-term cost burden associated with maintenance. A comparison between Ohio and Washington, D.C., highlights how systems shape these measures. Given the vast difference in geographic size and population, the comparison will focus on per capita measures. Comparing the transportation systems in Washington, D.C., and Ohio The state of Ohio has 11.7 million residents and more than 262,000 lane miles of roadway. This total includes everything from local streets to interstates and works out to roughly one lane mile of roadway per 45 residents. Ohio ranks near the middle nationally with the 17th-highest number of residents per lane mile. By comparison, the District of Columbia has 706,000 residents and a little more than 3,400 lane miles of roadway, or one lane mile per 205 residents. This means that every lane mile of roadway in Washington, D.C., supports, on average, 4 1/2 times as many residents as in Ohio. On a daily basis, every lane mile of roadway in Washington facilitates more movement of people and commerce than the equivalent lane mile in Ohio, making Washington’s roads fundamentally more productive than Ohio’s on a per-mile basis. Stated differently, every dollar spent on building and maintaining the roadway network in Washington is providing a larger economic return on investment than the equivalent dollar spent in Ohio. At any given moment, a larger share of Ohio’s roadway network is sitting idle, slowly deteriorating due to the passage of time and the stress caused by weather. Importantly, this is not an argument that the residents of Washington are more productive than their Ohio counterparts, but rather a measure of system efficiency. The economic production function of Washington requires far less linear infrastructure per unit of output. And Ohio’s transportation system is not an outlier. Fast-growing Texas has 42 residents per lane mile, while Georgia, Indiana, and Missouri have 39, 33, and 22 residents per lane mile, respectively. When it comes time to repair or expand the roadway network, the higher population density of Washington means the per-mile cost is spread out over 4 1/2 times as many residents as Ohio. This is not a trivial matter: According to data from the Federal Highway Administration, in major urban areas, the average cost to reconstruct or to add one lane mile of interstate is $8.4 million or $70 million, respectively.8 Yet the biggest difference between the transportation systems in Washington and Ohio is how people use them. According to data collected by the U.S. Census Bureau on commuting choices, 83 percent of Ohio adults drive to work alone, while only 4 percent take transit, bike, or walk.9 In Washington, only 34 percent of residents drive alone, while 53 percent take transit, bike, or walk.10 The climate effects of these mobility choices are enormous. The average Ohio driver travels 10,300 miles per year compared with 5,300 miles for the average Washington driver.11 This means that the average driver in Ohio is responsible for emitting approximately 4.2 metric tons of CO2 each year compared with roughly 2.2 metric tons for the average driver in Washington.12 These stark differences are not the result of Washington residents’ moral virtue or extreme dedication to combating climate change. District residents drive less and take transit more because the city invests heavily in transit service, making it both extensive and frequent—though certainly not perfect. For instance, in fiscal year 2019, the last full budget cycle prior to the coronavirus pandemic, Washington, D.C., provided an operating subsidy of more than $369 million to the Washington Metro Area Transit Authority.13 By comparison, the state of Ohio spent just $6.5 million in total on transit from its General Revenue Fund in FY 2019.14 Washington’s robust transit system supports greater residential and commercial density than the largest cities in Ohio. According to Census Bureau data, Washington has a population density of more than 9,850 resident per square mile, compared with 5,100 in Cleveland, 3,800 in Cincinnati, and 3,600 in Columbus.15 While dense, Washington is also very livable, and the built environment is human-scaled due to a federal law that restricts the height and width of buildings within the city. Residential buildings are limited to “the width of the street, avenue, or highway in its front, increased by 20 feet,” while buildings on commercial streets are limited to “the height of 130 feet on a business street.”16 As a result of this restriction, Washington has a diverse mix of housing located in walkable, low-intensity neighborhoods. Contrary to what might be expected with high overall density, Washington has more than 114,000 single-family homes and nearly 89,000 small apartment buildings with between two and 19 units.17 Collectively, these units account for 63 percent of all housing in Washington, with the remainder being buildings with 20 units or more.18 The point is not that municipal or county jurisdictions should adopt a height restriction, but rather that achieving a sustainable transportation and land use system does not require a local community to look like the steel canyons of Midtown Manhattan. New York City has long served as a useful, though deeply cynical, boogieman for opponents of transportation and land use reform. Yet Washington illustrates that cities and towns can achieve a sustainable, human-scaled form while still zoning for single-family homes and keeping multifamily buildings to five or six stories. Unpriced highway expansion is not the solution to metropolitan congestion Not only does building new highways run counter to national climate goals, but decades of heavy federal investment in unpriced highway expansion have produced disappointing performance results. From 2000 to 2019, the United States dramatically expanded its highway network, adding 104,000 lane miles of mostly unpriced interstates, freeways, and other arterial roadways in urban areas—an increase of 34 percent.19 In fact, the rate of highway expansion has been double the rate of overall population growth, which is 16.5 percent since 2000. However, even with this level of expansion, annual hours of delay per auto commuter have increased by 42 percent from 38 hours to 54 hours over the same period.20 In constant 2017 dollars, over the past two decades, the annual cost of congestion has risen from $75 billion to $178 billion. Endlessly building unpriced highways is both unsustainable and ineffective; it does not reduce congestion in growing metropolitan regions. The hours of delay measure—and, by extension, the overall cost of congestion—is based on the difference between travel speeds under free-flow highway conditions and observed travel speeds, which are often slower due to varying levels of congestion. Using free-flow speed as the baseline for calculating performance is highly problematic because building a highway system that delivers consistent free-flow travel speeds is less productive and efficient (vehicle spacing increases at higher speeds, meaning a lane is actually more productive and carries more cars per hour as congestion rises and speeds drop). Only 15 percent of daily trips nationwide are spent commuting, and a highway network designed to maximize free-flow conditions during the morning and evening peak travel period would result in a wasteful overbuild.21 Having said that, vehicle speed and delay are the most widely used industry performance measures. Thus, sustained highway expansion has failed by the industry’s own favored metric. The INVEST Act Congress is currently debating the reauthorization of federal highway, transit, and passenger rail programs. The U.S. House of Representatives has passed the INVEST Act, which contains several key policy reforms to address climate change and improve overall system performance.22 When asked about the reforms in the bill, Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio stated, “We have to begin to look at alternatives. You can’t pave over the whole country.”23 This statement was a frank admission by the chairman that Congress cannot advance a transportation bill that would extend the status quo. This section highlights three provisions of the INVEST Act that—if implemented in accordance with congressional intent and enforced—would start to push the surface transportation system in a more sustainable and productive direction: Section 1403, Section 1201, and Section 1213. Section 1403 Section 1403 makes changes and additions to the 23 U.S.C. 150 national goals and performance management measures, which Congress established in 2012 to hold states and metropolitan regions accountable for achieving national policy goals.24 Under 23 U.S.C. 150, states and regions are required to adopt performance targets for each of the performance measures set in law, including measures for asset condition, safety, and mobile source emissions, among others.25 The current form of 23 U.S.C. 150 contains two problematic provisions that hamper its effectiveness. First, it permits states and regions to set any target, including regressive ones that would represent failing performance. For instance, a state or region could establish a target of increasing roadway injuries and fatalities or increasing disrepair of highway pavement and bridges. Second, opponents of measures to address climate change have argued that the language around mobile source emissions refers to criteria pollutants under the Clean Air Act and excludes greenhouse gases.26 Section 1403 would remedy both issues. The bill would prohibit “regressive targets,” meaning states would have to set a per capita GHG target that represented “constant or improved performance.”27 The prohibition on regressive targets would also apply to the performance measures for serious injuries and fatalities. The act does not prescribe how states must achieve improved performance, allowing them to adopt the project mix that best meets their unique system characteristics. Section 1403 would also clearly implement new GHG measures, instructing the U.S. secretary of transportation to “establish, in consultation with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, measures for States to use to assess … carbon dioxide emissions per capita on public roads” and “any other greenhouse gas emissions on public roads that the Secretary determines to be appropriate.”28 Section 1201 Section 1201 amends the National Highway Performance Program (NHPP), the main funding account in support of highway capacity expansion projects. The bill would require states to meet several thresholds before they can use NHPP money for any expansion project that would serve single-occupant vehicles. Specifically, states would have to demonstrate to the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) that they are making progress on achieving a state of good system repair, that the proposed highway expansion project is more cost effective than an operational improvement or transit, and that the state has a financial plan for long-term maintenance of the new lanes.29 As a result, states would have to demonstrate to the secretary of transportation’s satisfaction that a proposed expansion project is truly the best alternative—not a small hurdle to clear. Additionally, Section 1201 recognizes the social damage caused by highway construction and adds a new project eligibility category to improve community connectivity. The bill authorizes “the removal, retrofit, repurposing, remediation, or replacement of a highway on the National Highway System that creates a barrier to community connectivity to improve access for multiple modes of transportation.”30 Section 1213 Finally, Section 1213 establishes a new carbon pollution reduction program. The program would be the first in DOT history exclusively dedicated to reducing GHG emissions. Eligible projects include those that are “expected to yield a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the surface transportation system” and “will help a State meet the greenhouse gas emissions performance targets.”31 Furthermore, the section states that “[n]one of the funds provided under this section may be used for a project that will result in the construction of new capacity available to single occupant vehicles,” with certain narrow exceptions as defined by 23 U.S.C. 166.32 Conclusion Continuing to build new unpriced highway capacity will only result in the same poor performance, divided communities, and excess pollution as in the past. Instead, structural policy reforms are necessary to build back better from the coronavirus pandemic and to combat climate change. The provisions in the INVEST Act, for example, are a strong step in a new direction, pushing states and regions to make different, more sustainable, and more productive investments with federal dollars. The status quo is not an option. Kevin DeGood is the director of Infrastructure Policy at the Center for American Progress.

When carried out in a communitarian way, management has the potential to strengthen the social and political space of families and the community - since they must act as protagonists in the production and organization process - in addition to providing productive inclusion, income guarantee and greater appropriation on land. However, there are barriers to be overcome for the consolidation of community forest management, such as: ensuring access and use of the forest, strengthening social organization, credit, technical assistance and market access. Management promotion is particularly relevant in the state of Amazonas, which, on the one hand, holds the largest area of conserved forest in the Amazon, but, on the other hand, presented the highest deforestation growth between 2015 and 2016. Although approximately 10% of the area of the State of Amazonas is devoted to plant extractivism, the participation of smallholder timber management plans (small scale, lower impact and floodplain) in relation to total licensed volume was not very expressive: 4% during the period from 2010 to 2014, ranging from 8% in the first year to 2% in the latter. And, according to an IDESAM study, only 20% of the volume of timber licensed in 2014 for small-scale management plans developed by the institution were commercialized. THE PROJECT The project foresees the structuring of the Forestry Cities network which includes the physical structuring of a Forest Center - which will serve as the technology core of the project, besides facilitating the connection of forest actors - and the development of a technological platform. The tool will be dedicated to the management of the property, the elaboration and execution of the management plans and the connection between the forest actors. The use of the platform seeks to ensure that the forest management of small farms is carried out in accordance with the applicable legislation, favoring adherence to public policies and promoting the commercialization of managed production. In addition, the project will support the implementation of 25 management plans to be executed by 15 local associations, with the goal of increasing 40% of the current supply of wood from small-scale timber management plans in Amazonas. The support for the implementation of the plans will be provided through: i) training of managers for a better use of the raw material, safety, planning and marketing; ii) field actions for the exploitation and commercialization of wood. The project will also support other actions dedicated to structuring a network of vegetable oils in the Amazon and increasing the attractiveness of forest products, such as the certification of production chains.

London has been a major settlement for two millennia, and was originally called Londinium, which was founded by the Romans.[10] The City of London, London's ancient core and financial centre, an area of just 1.12 square miles (2.9 km2) and colloquially known as the Square Mile, retains boundaries that closely follow its medieval limits.[note 1][11][12][13][14][15] The adjacent City of Westminster has for centuries been the location of much of the national government. Thirty-one additional boroughs north and south of the river also comprise modern London. The London region is governed by the mayor of London and the London Assembly.[note 2][16][17] London is one of the world's most important global cities.[18] It exerts considerable influence on the arts, commerce, education, entertainment, fashion, finance, healthcare, media, professional services, research and development, tourism, and transportation.[19] It is one of the largest financial centres in the world and in 2019, London had the second highest number of ultra high-net-worth individuals in Europe, after Paris.[20] And in 2020, London had the second-highest number of billionaires of any city in Europe, after Moscow.[21] London's universities form the largest concentration of higher education institutes in Europe,[22] and London is home to highly ranked institutions such as Imperial College London in natural and applied sciences, the London School of Economics in social sciences, as well as the comprehensive University College London.[23] In 2012, London became the first city to have hosted three modern Summer Olympic Games.[24] London has a diverse range of people and cultures, and more than 300 languages are spoken in the region.[25] Its estimated mid-2018 municipal population (corresponding to Greater London) was roughly 9 million,[5] which made it the third-most populous city in Europe.[26] London accounts for 13.4% of the U.K. population.[27] Greater London Built-up Area is the fourth-most populous in Europe, after Istanbul, Moscow, and Paris, with 9,787,426 inhabitants at the 2011 census.[28][29] The London metropolitan area is the third-most populous in Europe, after Istanbul and the Moscow Metropolitan Area, with 14,040,163 inhabitants in 2016.[note 3][4][30] London contains four World Heritage Sites: the Tower of London; Kew Gardens; the site comprising the Palace of Westminster, Westminster Abbey, and St Margaret's Church; and the historic settlement in Greenwich where the Royal Observatory, Greenwich defines the Prime Meridian (0° longitude) and Greenwich Mean Time.[31] Other landmarks include Buckingham Palace, the London Eye, Piccadilly Circus, St Paul's Cathedral, Tower Bridge, Trafalgar Square and The Shard. London has numerous museums, galleries, libraries and sporting events. These include the British Museum, National Gallery, Natural History Museum, Tate Modern, British Library and West End theatres.[32] The London Underground is the oldest rapid transit system in the world.Contents 1 Toponymy 2 History 2.1 Prehistory 2.2 Roman London 2.3 Anglo-Saxon and Viking period London 2.4 Middle Ages 2.5 Early modern 2.6 Late modern and contemporary 3 Administration 3.1 Local government 3.2 National government 3.3 Policing and crime 4 Geography 4.1 Scope 4.2 Status 4.3 Topography 4.4 Climate 4.5 Districts 4.6 Architecture 4.7 Cityscape 4.8 Natural history 5 Demography 5.1 Age structure and median age (2018) 5.2 Ethnic groups 5.3 Religion 5.4 Accents 6 Economy 6.1 The City of London 6.2 Media and technology 6.3 Tourism 7 Transport 7.1 Aviation 7.2 Rail 7.2.1 Underground and DLR 7.2.2 Suburban 7.2.3 Inter-city and international 7.2.4 Freight 7.3 Buses, coaches and trams 7.4 Cable car 7.5 Cycling 7.6 Port and river boats 7.7 Roads 8 Education 8.1 Tertiary education 8.2 Primary and secondary education 9 Culture 9.1 Leisure and entertainment 9.2 Literature, film and television 9.3 Museums, art galleries and libraries 9.4 Music 10 Recreation 10.1 Parks and open spaces 10.2 Walking 11 Sport 12 Notable people 13 See also 14 Notes 15 References 15.1 Bibliography 16 External links Toponymy Main article: Etymology of London London is an ancient name, already attested in the first century AD, usually in the Latinised form Londinium;[33] for example, handwritten Roman tablets recovered in the city originating from AD 65/70–80 include the word Londinio ('in London').[34] Over the years, the name has attracted many mythicising explanations. The earliest attested appears in Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae, written around 1136.[33][35] Modern scientific analyses of the name must account for the origins of the different forms found in early sources: Latin (usually Londinium), Old English (usually Lunden), and Welsh (usually Llundein), with reference to the known developments over time of sounds in those different languages. It is agreed that the name came into these languages from Common Brythonic; recent work tends to reconstruct the lost Celtic form of the name as *Londonjon or something similar. This was adapted into Latin as Londinium and borrowed into Old English, the ancestor-language of English.[36] The toponymy of the Common Brythonic form is much debated. A prominent explanation was Richard Coates's 1998 argument that the name derived from pre-Celtic Old European *(p)lowonida, meaning ""river too wide to ford"". Coates suggested that this was a name given to the part of the River Thames which flows through London; from this, the settlement gained the Celtic form of its name, *Lowonidonjon.[37] However, most work has accepted a Celtic origin for the name, and recent studies have favoured an explanation along the lines of a Celtic derivative of a Proto-Indo-European root *lendh- ('sink, cause to sink'), combined with the Celtic suffix *-injo- or *-onjo- (used to form place-names). Peter Schrijver has specifically suggested, on these grounds, that the name originally meant 'place that floods (periodically, tidally)'.[38][36] Until 1889, the name ""London"" applied officially only to the City of London, but since then it has also referred to the County of London and to Greater London.[39] In writing, ""London"" is, on occasion, colloquially contracted to ""LDN"".[40][clarification needed] Such usage originated in SMS language, and is often found, on a social media user profile, suffixing an alias or handle. History Main articles: History of London and Timeline of London Prehistory In 1993, the remains of a Bronze Age bridge were found on the south foreshore, upstream of Vauxhall Bridge.[41] This bridge either crossed the Thames or reached a now lost island in it. Two of those timbers were radiocarbon dated to between 1750 BC and 1285 BC.[41] In 2010, the foundations of a large timber structure, dated to between 4800 BC and 4500 BC,[42] were found on the Thames's south foreshore, downstream of Vauxhall Bridge.[43] The function of the mesolithic structure is not known. Both structures are on the south bank of the Thames where the now-underground River Effra flows into the Thames.[43] Roman London Main article: Londinium In 1300, the City was still confined within the Roman walls. Although there is evidence of scattered Brythonic settlements in the area, the first major settlement was founded by the Romans about four years[2] after the invasion of AD 43.[44] This lasted only until around AD 61, when the Iceni tribe led by Queen Boudica stormed it, burning the settlement to the ground.[45] The next, heavily planned, incarnation of Londinium prospered, and it superseded Colchester as the capital of the Roman province of Britannia in 100. At its height in the 2nd century, Roman London had a population of around 60,000.[46] Anglo-Saxon and Viking period London With the collapse of Roman rule in the early 5th century, London ceased to be a capital, and the walled city of Londinium was effectively abandoned, although Roman civilisation continued in the area of St Martin-in-the-Fields until around 450.[47] From around 500, an Anglo-Saxon settlement known as Lundenwic developed slightly west of the old Roman city.[48] By about 680, the city had regrown into a major port, although there is little evidence of large-scale production. From the 820s repeated Viking assaults brought decline. Three are recorded; those in 851 and 886 succeeded, while the last, in 994, was rebuffed.[49] The Lancastrian siege of London in 1471 is attacked by a Yorkist sally. The Vikings established Danelaw over much of eastern and northern England; its boundary stretched roughly from London to Chester. It was an area of political and geographical control imposed by the Viking incursions which was formally agreed by the Danish warlord, Guthrum and the West Saxon king Alfred the Great in 886. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle recorded that Alfred ""refounded"" London in 886. Archaeological research shows that this involved abandonment of Lundenwic and a revival of life and trade within the old Roman walls. London then grew slowly until about 950, after which activity increased dramatically.[50] By the 11th century, London was beyond all comparison the largest town in England. Westminster Abbey, rebuilt in the Romanesque style by King Edward the Confessor, was one of the grandest churches in Europe. Winchester had previously been the capital of Anglo-Saxon England, but from this time on, London became the main forum for foreign traders and the base for defence in time of war. In the view of Frank Stenton: ""It had the resources, and it was rapidly developing the dignity and the political self-consciousness appropriate to a national capital.""[51][52] Middle Ages Westminster Abbey, as seen in this painting (by Canaletto, 1749), is a World Heritage Site and one of London's oldest and most important buildings. After winning the Battle of Hastings, William, Duke of Normandy was crowned King of England in the newly completed Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day 1066.[53] William constructed the Tower of London, the first of the many Norman castles in England to be rebuilt in stone, in the southeastern corner of the city, to intimidate the native inhabitants.[54] In 1097, William II began the building of Westminster Hall, close by the abbey of the same name. The hall became the basis of a new Palace of Westminster.[55][56] In the 12th century, the institutions of central government, which had hitherto accompanied the royal English court as it moved around the country, grew in size and sophistication and became increasingly fixed in one place. For most purposes this was Westminster, although the royal treasury, having been moved from Winchester, came to rest in the Tower. While the City of Westminster developed into a true capital in governmental terms, its distinct neighbour, the City of London, remained England's largest city and principal commercial centre, and it flourished under its own unique administration, the Corporation of London. In 1100, its population was around 18,000; by 1300 it had grown to nearly 100,000.[57] Disaster struck in the form of the Black Death in the mid-14th century, when London lost nearly a third of its population.[58] London was the focus of the Peasants' Revolt in 1381.[59] London was also a centre of England's Jewish population before their expulsion by Edward I in 1290. Violence against Jews took place in 1190, after it was rumoured that the new king had ordered their massacre after they had presented themselves at his coronation.[60] In 1264 during the Second Barons' War, Simon de Montfort's rebels killed 500 Jews while attempting to seize records of debts.[61] Early modern Map of London in 1593. There is only one bridge across the Thames, but parts of Southwark on the south bank of the river have been developed. During the Tudor period the Reformation produced a gradual shift to Protestantism, and much of London property passed from church to private ownership, which accelerated trade and business in the city.[62] In 1475, the Hanseatic League set up its main trading base (kontor) of England in London, called the Stalhof or Steelyard. It existed until 1853, when the Hanseatic cities of Lübeck, Bremen and Hamburg sold the property to South Eastern Railway.[63] Woollen cloth was shipped undyed and undressed from 14th/15th century London to the nearby shores of the Low Countries, where it was considered indispensable.[64] But the reach of English maritime enterprise hardly extended beyond the seas of north-west Europe. The commercial route to Italy and the Mediterranean Sea normally lay through Antwerp and over the Alps; any ships passing through the Strait of Gibraltar to or from England were likely to be Italian or Ragusan. Upon the re-opening of the Netherlands to English shipping in January 1565, there ensued a strong outburst of commercial activity.[65] The Royal Exchange was founded.[66] Mercantilism grew, and monopoly trading companies such as the East India Company were established, with trade expanding to the New World. London became the principal North Sea port, with migrants arriving from England and abroad. The population rose from an estimated 50,000 in 1530 to about 225,000 in 1605.[62] In the 16th century William Shakespeare and his contemporaries lived in London at a time of hostility to the development of the theatre. By the end of the Tudor period in 1603, London was still very compact. There was an assassination attempt on James I in Westminster, in the Gunpowder Plot on 5 November 1605.[67] In 1637, the government of Charles I attempted to reform administration in the area of London. The plan called for the Corporation of the city to extend its jurisdiction and administration over expanding areas around the city. Fearing an attempt by the Crown to diminish the Liberties of London, a lack of interest in administering these additional areas, or concern by city guilds of having to share power, the Corporation refused. Later called ""The Great Refusal"", this decision largely continues to account for the unique governmental status of the City.[68] Vertue's 1738 plan of the Lines of Communication, built during the English Civil War In the English Civil War the majority of Londoners supported the Parliamentary cause. After an initial advance by the Royalists in 1642, culminating in the battles of Brentford and Turnham Green, London was surrounded by a defensive perimeter wall known as the Lines of Communication. The lines were built by up to 20,000 people, and were completed in under two months.[69] The fortifications failed their only test when the New Model Army entered London in 1647,[70] and they were levelled by Parliament the same year.[71] London was plagued by disease in the early 17th century,[72] culminating in the Great Plague of 1665–1666, which killed up to 100,000 people, or a fifth of the population.[73] The Great Fire of London destroyed many parts of the city in 1666. The Great Fire of London broke out in 1666 in Pudding Lane in the city and quickly swept through the wooden buildings.[74] Rebuilding took over ten years and was supervised by Robert Hooke[75][76][77] as Surveyor of London.[78] In 1708 Christopher Wren's masterpiece, St Paul's Cathedral was completed. During the Georgian era, new districts such as Mayfair were formed in the west; new bridges over the Thames encouraged development in South London. In the east, the Port of London expanded downstream. London's development as an international financial centre matured for much of the 1700s. In 1762, George III acquired Buckingham House and it was enlarged over the next 75 years. During the 18th century, London was dogged by crime, and the Bow Street Runners were established in 1750 as a professional police force.[79] In total, more than 200 offences were punishable by death,[80] including petty theft.[81] Most children born in the city died before reaching their third birthday.[82] View to the Royal Exchange in the City of London in 1886 The coffeehouse became a popular place to debate ideas, with growing literacy and the development of the printing press making news widely available; and Fleet Street became the centre of the British press. Following the invasion of Amsterdam by Napoleonic armies, many financiers relocated to London and the first London international issue was arranged in 1817. Around the same time, the Royal Navy became the world leading war fleet, acting as a serious deterrent to potential economic adversaries of the United Kingdom. The repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 was specifically aimed at weakening Dutch economic power. London then overtook Amsterdam as the leading international financial centre.[83][84] According to Samuel Johnson: You find no man, at all intellectual, who is willing to leave London. No, Sir, when a man is tired of London, he is tired of life; for there is in London all that life can afford.— Samuel Johnson, 1777[85] Late modern and contemporary London was the world's largest city from c.1831 to 1925,[86] with a population density of 325 people per hectare.[87] London's overcrowded conditions led to cholera epidemics,[88] claiming 14,000 lives in 1848, and 6,000 in 1866.[89] Rising traffic congestion led to the creation of the world's first local urban rail network. The Metropolitan Board of Works oversaw infrastructure expansion in the capital and some of the surrounding counties; it was abolished in 1889 when the London County Council was created out of those areas of the counties surrounding the capital. British volunteer recruits in London, August 1914, during World War IA bombed-out London street during the Blitz, World War II London was bombed by the Germans during the First World War,[90] and during the Second World War, the Blitz and other bombings by the German Luftwaffe killed over 30,000 Londoners, destroying large tracts of housing and other buildings across the city.[91] The 1948 Summer Olympics were held at the original Wembley Stadium, at a time when London was still recovering from the war.[92] From the 1940s onwards, London became home to many immigrants, primarily from Commonwealth countries such as Jamaica, India, Bangladesh and Pakistan,[93] making London one of the most diverse cities worldwide. In 1951, the Festival of Britain was held on the South Bank.[94] The Great Smog of 1952 led to the Clean Air Act 1956, which ended the ""pea soup fogs"" for which London had been notorious.[95] Primarily starting in the mid-1960s, London became a centre for the worldwide youth culture, exemplified by the Swinging London subculture[96] associated with the King's Road, Chelsea[97] and Carnaby Street.[98] The role of trendsetter was revived during the punk era.[99] In 1965 London's political boundaries were expanded to take into account the growth of the urban area and a new Greater London Council was created.[100] During The Troubles in Northern Ireland, London was subjected to bombing attacks by the Provisional Irish Republican Army[101] for two decades, starting with the Old Bailey bombing in 1973.[102][103] Racial inequality was highlighted by the 1981 Brixton riot.[104] Greater London's population declined steadily in the decades after the Second World War, from an estimated peak of 8.6 million in 1939 to around 6.8 million in the 1980s.[105] The principal ports for London moved downstream to Felixstowe and Tilbury, with the London Docklands area becoming a focus for regeneration, including the Canary Wharf development. This was borne out of London's ever-increasing role as a major international financial centre during the 1980s.[106] The Thames Barrier was completed in the 1980s to protect London against tidal surges from the North Sea.[107] The Greater London Council was abolished in 1986, which left London without a central administration until 2000 when London-wide government was restored, with the creation of the Greater London Authority.[108] To celebrate the start of the 21st century, the Millennium Dome, London Eye and Millennium Bridge were constructed.[109] On 6 July 2005 London was awarded the 2012 Summer Olympics, making London the first city to stage the Olympic Games three times.[110] On 7 July 2005, three London Underground trains and a double-decker bus were bombed in a series of terrorist attacks.[111] In 2008, Time named London alongside New York City and Hong Kong as Nylonkong, hailing it as the world's three most influential global cities.[112] In January 2015, Greater London's population was estimated to be 8.63 million, the highest level since 1939.[113] During the Brexit referendum in 2016, the UK as a whole decided to leave the European Union, but a majority of London constituencies voted to remain in the EU.[114] Administration Politics of London Greater London Authority Mayor of London Sadiq Khan Mayoral elections Statutory Deputy Mayor Joanne McCartney Mayoral cabinet London Assembly Constituencies 2016 London Assembly election GLA Group Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime Transport for London London Fire Commissioner London Legacy Development Corporation & Old Oak and Park Royal Development Corporation London Plan 1998 referendum 1999 Act 2007 Act London Councils City of London Corporation Lord Mayor Peter Estlin Court of Aldermen Court of Common Council 2017 City of London Corporation election Freemen Livery Sheriffs Wards London boroughs 2018 London local elections Wards London in the UK Minister for London Paul Scully Parliamentary constituencies in London London Government Act 1963 London portal Politics portalvte Local government Main articles: Local government in London, History of local government in London, and List of heads of London government The administration of London is formed of two tiers: a citywide, strategic tier and a local tier. Citywide administration is coordinated by the Greater London Authority (GLA), while local administration is carried out by 33 smaller authorities.[115] The GLA consists of two elected components: the mayor of London, who has executive powers, and the London Assembly, which scrutinises the mayor's decisions and can accept or reject the mayor's budget proposals each year. The headquarters of the GLA is City Hall, Southwark. The mayor since 2016 has been Sadiq Khan, the first Muslim mayor of a major Western capital.[116][117] The mayor's statutory planning strategy is published as the London Plan, which was most recently revised in 2011.[118] The local authorities are the councils of the 32 London boroughs and the City of London Corporation.[119] They are responsible for most local services, such as local planning, schools, social services, local roads and refuse collection. Certain functions, such as waste management, are provided through joint arrangements. In 2009–2010 the combined revenue expenditure by London councils and the GLA amounted to just over £22 billion (£14.7 billion for the boroughs and £7.4 billion for the GLA).[120] The London Fire Brigade is the statutory fire and rescue service for Greater London. It is run by the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority and is the third largest fire service in the world.[121] National Health Service ambulance services are provided by the London Ambulance Service (LAS) NHS Trust, the largest free-at-the-point-of-use emergency ambulance service in the world.[122] The London Air Ambulance charity operates in conjunction with the LAS where required. Her Majesty's Coastguard and the Royal National Lifeboat Institution operate on the River Thames,[123][124] which is under the jurisdiction of the Port of London Authority from Teddington Lock to the sea.[125] National government London is the seat of the Government of the United Kingdom. Many government departments, as well as the prime minister's residence at 10 Downing Street, are based close to the Palace of Westminster, particularly along Whitehall.[126] There are 73 members of Parliament (MPs) from London, elected from local parliamentary constituencies in the national Parliament. As of December 2019[update], 49 are from the Labour Party, 21 are Conservatives, and three are Liberal Democrat.[127] The ministerial post of minister for London was created in 1994. The current Minister for London is Paul Scully MP.[128] Policing and crime Main article: Crime in London Policing in Greater London, with the exception of the City of London, is provided by the Metropolitan Police, overseen by the mayor through the Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime (MOPAC).[129][130] The City of London has its own police force – the City of London Police.[131] The British Transport Police are responsible for police services on National Rail, London Underground, Docklands Light Railway and Tramlink services.[132] The Ministry of Defence Police is a special police force in London, which does not generally become involved with policing the general public.[133] Crime rates vary widely across different areas of London. Crime figures are made available nationally at Local Authority and Ward level.[134] In 2015, there were 118 homicides, a 25.5% increase over 2014.[135] The Metropolitan Police have made detailed crime figures, broken down by category at borough and ward level, available on their website since 2000.[136][137] Recorded crime has been rising in London, notably violent crime and murder by stabbing and other means have risen. There were 50 murders from the start of 2018 to mid April 2018. Funding cuts to police in London are likely to have contributed to this, though other factors are also involved.[138] Geography Main article: Geography of London Scope Satellite view of London in June 2018 London, also referred to as Greater London, is one of nine regions of England and the top-level subdivision covering most of the city's metropolis.[note 4] The small ancient City of London at its core once comprised the whole settlement, but as its urban area grew, the Corporation of London resisted attempts to amalgamate the city with its suburbs , causing ""London"" to be defined in a number of ways for different purposes.[139] Forty per cent of Greater London is covered by the London post town, within which 'LONDON' forms part of postal addresses.[140][141] The London telephone area code (020) covers a larger area, similar in size to Greater London, although some outer districts are excluded and some places just outside are included. The Greater London boundary has been aligned to the M25 motorway in places.[142] Outward urban expansion is now prevented by the Metropolitan Green Belt,[143] although the built-up area extends beyond the boundary in places, resulting in a separately defined Greater London Urban Area. Beyond this is the vast London commuter belt.[144] Greater London is split for some purposes into Inner London and Outer London.[145] The city is split by the River Thames into North and South, with an informal central London area in its interior. The coordinates of the nominal centre of London, traditionally considered to be the original Eleanor Cross at Charing Cross near the junction of Trafalgar Square and Whitehall, are about 51°30′26″N 00°07′39″W﻿ / ﻿51.50722°N 0.12750°W﻿ / 51.50722; -0.12750.[146] However the geographical centre of London, on one definition, is in the London Borough of Lambeth, just 0.1 miles to the northeast of Lambeth North tube station.[147] Status Within London, both the City of London and the City of Westminster have city status and both the City of London and the remainder of Greater London are counties for the purposes of lieutenancies.[148] The area of Greater London includes areas that are part of the historic counties of Middlesex, Kent, Surrey, Essex and Hertfordshire.[149] London's status as the capital of England, and later the United Kingdom, has never been granted or confirmed officially—by statute or in written form.[note 5] Its position was formed through constitutional convention, making its status as de facto capital a part of the UK's uncodified constitution. The capital of England was moved to London from Winchester as the Palace of Westminster developed in the 12th and 13th centuries to become the permanent location of the royal court, and thus the political capital of the nation.[153] More recently, Greater London has been defined as a region of England and in this context is known as London.[14] Topography London from Primrose Hill Greater London encompasses a total area of 1,583 square kilometres (611 sq mi), an area which had a population of 7,172,036 in 2001 and a population density of 4,542 inhabitants per square kilometre (11,760/sq mi). The extended area known as the London Metropolitan Region or the London Metropolitan Agglomeration, comprises a total area of 8,382 square kilometres (3,236 sq mi) has a population of 13,709,000 and a population density of 1,510 inhabitants per square kilometre (3,900/sq mi).[154] Modern London stands on the Thames, its primary geographical feature, a navigable river which crosses the city from the south-west to the east. The Thames Valley is a floodplain surrounded by gently rolling hills including Parliament Hill, Addington Hills, and Primrose Hill. Historically London grew up at the lowest bridging point on the Thames. The Thames was once a much broader, shallower river with extensive marshlands; at high tide, its shores reached five times their present width.[155] Since the Victorian era the Thames has been extensively embanked, and many of its London tributaries now flow underground. The Thames is a tidal river, and London is vulnerable to flooding.[156] The threat has increased over time because of a slow but continuous rise in high water level by the slow 'tilting' of the British Isles (up in Scotland and Northern Ireland and down in southern parts of England, Wales and Ireland) caused by post-glacial rebound.[157][158] In 1974 a decade of work began on the construction of the Thames Barrier across the Thames at Woolwich to deal with this threat. While the barrier is expected to function as designed until roughly 2070, concepts for its future enlargement or redesign are already being discussed.[159] Climate Main article: Climate of London London, United Kingdom Climate chart (explanation) J F M A M J J A S O N D 55 8 2 41 8 2 42 11 4 44 14 6 49 18 9 45 22 12 45 24 14 50 23 14 49 20 11 69 16 8 59 11 5 55 8 3 Average max. and min. temperatures in °C Precipitation totals in mm Imperial conversion JFMAMJJASOND 2.2 47 36 1.6 47 36 1.6 52 39 1.7 58 42 1.9 64 48 1.8 72 53 1.8 74 57 1.9 74 57 1.9 68 53 2.7 60 47 2.3 52 41 2.2 47 37 Average max. and min. temperatures in °F Precipitation totals in inches London has a temperate oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb ). Rainfall records have been kept in the city since at least 1697, when records began at Kew. At Kew, the most rainfall in one month is 7.4 inches (189 mm) in November 1755 and the least is 0 inches (0 mm) in both December 1788 and July 1800. Mile End also had 0 inches (0 mm) in April 1893.[160] The wettest year on record is 1903, with a total fall of 38.1 inches (969 mm) and the driest is 1921, with a total fall of 12.1 inches (308 mm).[161] The average annual precipitation amounts to about 600 mm, lower than cities such as Rome, Lisbon, New York City and Sydney.[162][163][164] Nevertheless, despite its relatively low annual precipitation, London still receives 109.6 rainy days on the 1.0 mm threshold annually—higher than, or at least very similar to, the aforementioned cities. Temperature extremes in London range from 38.1 °C (100.6 °F) at Kew on 10 August 2003[165] down to −16.1 °C (3.0 °F) at Northolt on 1 January 1962.[166][167] Records for atmospheric pressure have been kept at London since 1692. The highest pressure ever reported is 1,049.8 millibars (31.00 inHg) on 20 January 2020.[168] Summers are generally warm, sometimes hot. London's average July high is 23.5 °C (74.3 °F). On average each year, London experiences 31 days above 25 °C (77.0 °F) and 4.2 days above 30.0 °C (86.0 °F). During the 2003 European heat wave prolonged heat led to hundreds of heat-related deaths.[169] There was also a previous spell of 15 consecutive days above 32.2 °C (90.0 °F) in England in 1976 which also caused many heat related deaths.[170] The previous record high was 37.8 °C (100.0 °F) in August 1911 at the Greenwich station.[171] Droughts can also, occasionally, be a problem, especially in summer. Most recently in Summer 2018[172] and with much drier than average conditions prevailing from May to December.[173] However, the most consecutive days without rain was 73 days in the spring of 1893.[174] Winters are generally cool with little temperature variation. Heavy snow is rare but snow usually falls at least once each winter. Spring and autumn can be pleasant. As a large city, London has a considerable urban heat island effect,[175] making the centre of London at times 5 °C (9 °F) warmer than the suburbs and outskirts. This can be seen below when comparing London Heathrow, 15 miles (24 km) west of London, with the London Weather Centre.[176] vteClimate data for London (LHR),[a] elevation: 25 m (82 ft), 1981–2010 normals Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °C (°F) 17.2(63.0) 21.2(70.2) 24.5(76.1) 29.4(84.9) 32.8(91.0) 35.6(96.1) 37.9(100.2) 38.1(100.6) 35.0(95.0) 29.5(85.1) 21.1(70.0) 17.4(63.3) 38.1(100.6) Average high °C (°F) 8.1(46.6) 8.4(47.1) 11.3(52.3) 14.2(57.6) 17.9(64.2) 21.2(70.2) 23.5(74.3) 23.2(73.8) 20.0(68.0) 15.5(59.9) 11.1(52.0) 8.3(46.9) 15.2(59.4) Daily mean °C (°F) 5.2(41.4) 5.3(41.5) 7.6(45.7) 9.9(49.8) 13.3(55.9) 16.5(61.7) 18.7(65.7) 18.5(65.3) 15.7(60.3) 12.0(53.6) 8.0(46.4) 5.5(41.9) 11.3(52.3) Average low °C (°F) 2.3(36.1) 2.1(35.8) 3.9(39.0) 5.5(41.9) 8.7(47.7) 11.7(53.1) 13.9(57.0) 13.7(56.7) 11.4(52.5) 8.4(47.1) 4.9(40.8) 2.7(36.9) 7.4(45.4) Record low °C (°F) −16.1(3.0) −12.2(10.0) −8.3(17.1) −3.2(26.2) −3.1(26.4) −0.6(30.9) 3.9(39.0) 2.1(35.8) 1.4(34.5) −5.5(22.1) −7.1(19.2) −14.2(6.4) −16.1(3.0) Average precipitation mm (inches) 55.2(2.17) 40.9(1.61) 41.6(1.64) 43.7(1.72) 49.4(1.94) 45.1(1.78) 44.5(1.75) 49.5(1.95) 49.1(1.93) 68.5(2.70) 59.0(2.32) 55.2(2.17) 601.7(23.68) Average precipitation days (≥ 1.0 mm) 11.1 8.5 9.3 9.1 8.8 8.2 7.7 7.5 8.1 10.8 10.3 10.2 109.6 Mean monthly sunshine hours 61.5 77.9 114.6 168.7 198.5 204.3 212.0 204.7 149.3 116.5 72.6 52.0 1,632.6 Percent possible sunshine 23 28 31 40 41 41 42 45 40 35 27 21 35 Average ultraviolet index 1 1 2 4 5 6 6 5 4 2 1 0 3 Source 1: Met Office[177][178][179] Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute[180][181] For more station data, see Climate of London.

Districts Main articles: List of districts of London and London boroughs Places within London's vast urban area are identified using district names, such as Mayfair, Southwark, Wembley and Whitechapel. These are either informal designations, reflect the names of villages that have been absorbed by sprawl, or are superseded administrative units such as parishes or former boroughs. Such names have remained in use through tradition, each referring to a local area with its own distinctive character, but without official boundaries. Since 1965 Greater London has been divided into 32 London boroughs in addition to the ancient City of London.[185][186] The City of London is the main financial district,[187] and Canary Wharf has recently developed into a new financial and commercial hub in the Docklands to the east. The West End is London's main entertainment and shopping district, attracting tourists.[188] West London includes expensive residential areas where properties can sell for tens of millions of pounds.[189] The average price for properties in Kensington and Chelsea is over £2 million with a similarly high outlay in most of central London.[190][191] The East End is the area closest to the original Port of London, known for its high immigrant population, as well as for being one of the poorest areas in London.[192] The surrounding East London area saw much of London's early industrial development; now, brownfield sites throughout the area are being redeveloped as part of the Thames Gateway including the London Riverside and Lower Lea Valley, which was developed into the Olympic Park for the 2012 Olympics and Paralympics.[192] Architecture Main articles: Architecture of London, List of tallest buildings and structures in London, and List of demolished buildings and structures in London The Tower of London, a medieval castle, dating in part to 1078 Trafalgar Square and its fountains, with Nelson's Column on the right London's buildings are too diverse to be characterised by any particular architectural style, partly because of their varying ages. Many grand houses and public buildings, such as the National Gallery, are constructed from Portland stone. Some areas of the city, particularly those just west of the centre, are characterised by white stucco or whitewashed buildings. Few structures in central London pre-date the Great Fire of 1666, these being a few trace Roman remains, the Tower of London and a few scattered Tudor survivors in the city. Further out is, for example, the Tudor-period Hampton Court Palace, England's oldest surviving Tudor palace, built by Cardinal Thomas Wolsey c.1515.[193] Part of the varied architectural heritage are the 17th-century churches by Wren, neoclassical financial institutions such as the Royal Exchange and the Bank of England, to the early 20th century Old Bailey and the 1960s Barbican Estate. The disused—but soon[when?] to be rejuvenated—1939 Battersea Power Station by the river in the south-west is a local landmark, while some railway termini are excellent examples of Victorian architecture, most notably St. Pancras and Paddington.[194] The density of London varies, with high employment density in the central area and Canary Wharf, high residential densities in inner London, and lower densities in Outer London. Modern styles juxtaposed with historic styles; 30 St Mary Axe, also known as ""The Gherkin"", towers over St Andrew Undershaft. The Monument in the City of London provides views of the surrounding area while commemorating the Great Fire of London, which originated nearby. Marble Arch and Wellington Arch, at the north and south ends of Park Lane, respectively, have royal connections, as do the Albert Memorial and Royal Albert Hall in Kensington. Nelson's Column is a nationally recognised monument in Trafalgar Square, one of the focal points of central London. Older buildings are mainly brick built, most commonly the yellow London stock brick or a warm orange-red variety, often decorated with carvings and white plaster mouldings.[195] In the dense areas, most of the concentration is via medium- and high-rise buildings. London's skyscrapers, such as 30 St Mary Axe, Tower 42, the Broadgate Tower and One Canada Square, are mostly in the two financial districts, the City of London and Canary Wharf. High-rise development is restricted at certain sites if it would obstruct protected views of St Paul's Cathedral and other historic buildings. Nevertheless, there are a number of tall skyscrapers in central London (see Tall buildings in London), including the 95-storey Shard London Bridge, the tallest building in the United Kingdom. Other notable modern buildings include City Hall in Southwark with its distinctive oval shape,[196] the Art Deco BBC Broadcasting House plus the Postmodernist British Library in Somers Town/Kings Cross and No 1 Poultry by James Stirling. What was formerly the Millennium Dome, by the Thames to the east of Canary Wharf, is now an entertainment venue called the O2 Arena. Cityscape The Houses of Parliament and Elizabeth Tower (Big Ben) on the right foreground, the London Eye on the left foreground and The Shard with Canary Wharf in the background; seen in September 2014 Natural history The London Natural History Society suggests that London is ""one of the World's Greenest Cities"" with more than 40 per cent green space or open water. They indicate that 2000 species of flowering plant have been found growing there and that the tidal Thames supports 120 species of fish.[197] They also state that over 60 species of bird nest in central London and that their members have recorded 47 species of butterfly, 1173 moths and more than 270 kinds of spider around London. London's wetland areas support nationally important populations of many water birds. London has 38 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs), two national nature reserves and 76 local nature reserves.[198] Amphibians are common in the capital, including smooth newts living by the Tate Modern, and common frogs, common toads, palmate newts and great crested newts. On the other hand, native reptiles such as slowworms, common lizards, barred grass snakes and adders, are mostly only seen in Outer London.[199] A fox on Ayres Street, Southwark, South London Among other inhabitants of London are 10,000 red foxes, so that there are now 16 foxes for every square mile (2.6 square kilometres) of London. These urban foxes are noticeably bolder than their country cousins, sharing the pavement with pedestrians and raising cubs in people's backyards. Foxes have even sneaked into the Houses of Parliament, where one was found asleep on a filing cabinet. Another broke into the grounds of Buckingham Palace, reportedly killing some of Queen Elizabeth II's prized pink flamingos.[200] Generally, however, foxes and city folk appear to get along. A survey in 2001 by the London-based Mammal Society found that 80 per cent of 3,779 respondents who volunteered to keep a diary of garden mammal visits liked having them around. This sample cannot be taken to represent Londoners as a whole.[201][202] Other mammals found in Greater London are hedgehog, brown rat, mice, rabbit, shrew, vole, and grey squirrel.[203] In wilder areas of Outer London, such as Epping Forest, a wide variety of mammals are found, including European hare, badger, field, bank and water vole, wood mouse, yellow-necked mouse, mole, shrew, and weasel, in addition to red fox, grey squirrel and hedgehog. A dead otter was found at The Highway, in Wapping, about a mile from the Tower Bridge, which would suggest that they have begun to move back after being absent a hundred years from the city.[204] Ten of England's eighteen species of bats have been recorded in Epping Forest: soprano, Nathusius' and common pipistrelles, common noctule, serotine, barbastelle, Daubenton's, brown long-eared, Natterer's and Leisler's.[205] Among the strange sights seen in London have been a whale in the Thames,[206] while the BBC Two programme ""Natural World: Unnatural History of London"" shows feral pigeons using the London Underground to get around the city, a seal that takes fish from fishmongers outside Billingsgate Fish Market, and foxes that will ""sit"" if given sausages.[207] Herds of red and fallow deer also roam freely within much of Richmond and Bushy Park. A cull takes place each November and February to ensure numbers can be sustained.[208] Epping Forest is also known for its fallow deer, which can frequently be seen in herds to the north of the Forest. A rare population of melanistic, black fallow deer is also maintained at the Deer Sanctuary near Theydon Bois. Muntjac deer, which escaped from deer parks at the turn of the twentieth century, are also found in the forest. While Londoners are accustomed to wildlife such as birds and foxes sharing the city, more recently urban deer have started becoming a regular feature, and whole herds of fallow deer come into residential areas at night to take advantage of London's green spaces.[209][210] Demography Main article: Demography of London 2011 United Kingdom Census[211] Country of birth Population United Kingdom 5,175,677 India 262,247 Poland 158,300 Ireland 129,807 Nigeria 114,718 Pakistan 112,457 Bangladesh 109,948 Jamaica 87,467 Sri Lanka 84,542 France 66,654 Population density map The 2011 census recorded that 2,998,264 people or 36.7% of London's population are foreign-born making London the city with the second largest immigrant population, behind New York City, in terms of absolute numbers. About 69% of children born in London in 2015 had at least one parent who was born abroad.[212] The table to the right shows the most common countries of birth of London residents. Note that some of the German-born population, in 18th position, are British citizens from birth born to parents serving in the British Armed Forces in Germany.[213] With increasing industrialisation, London's population grew rapidly throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, and it was for some time in the late 19th and early 20th centuries the most populous city in the world. Its population peaked at 8,615,245 in 1939 immediately before the outbreak of the Second World War, but had declined to 7,192,091 at the 2001 Census. However, the population then grew by just over a million between the 2001 and 2011 Censuses, to reach 8,173,941 in the latter enumeration.[214] However, London's continuous urban area extends beyond the borders of Greater London and was home to 9,787,426 people in 2011,[29] while its wider metropolitan area has a population of between 12 and 14 million depending on the definition used.[215][216] According to Eurostat, London is the most populous city and metropolitan area of the European Union and the second most populous in Europe. During the period 1991–2001 a net 726,000 immigrants arrived in London.[217] The region covers an area of 1,579 square kilometres (610 sq mi). The population density is 5,177 inhabitants per square kilometre (13,410/sq mi),[218] more than ten times that of any other British region.[219] In terms of population, London is the 19th largest city and the 18th largest metropolitan region.[220][221] Age structure and median age (2018) Children (aged younger than 14 years) constitute 20.6% of the population in Outer London, and 18% in Inner London; the age group aged between 15 and 24 years is 11.1% in Outer, and 10.2% in Inner London; those aged between 25 and 44 years are 30.6% in Outer London and 39.7% in Inner London; those aged between 45 and 64 years form 24% and 20.7% in Outer and Inner London respectively; while in Outer London those aged 65 and older are 13.6%, though in Inner London just 9.3%.[222] The median age of London in 2018 is 36.5 years old, which is younger than the average in UK of 40.3.[222] Ethnic groups Main article: Ethnic groups in London London maps showing the percentage distribution of selected races according to the 2011 CensusWhite BritishAsian BritishBlack British According to the Office for National Statistics, based on the 2011 Census estimates, 59.8 per cent of the 8,173,941 inhabitants of London were White, with 44.9 per cent White British, 2.2 per cent White Irish, 0.1 per cent gypsy/Irish traveller and 12.1 per cent classified as Other White.[223] 20.9 per cent of Londoners are of Asian and mixed-Asian descent. 19.7 per cent are of full Asian descent, with those of mixed-Asian heritage comprising 1.2 of the population. Indians account for 6.6 per cent of the population, followed by Pakistanis and Bangladeshis at 2.7 per cent each. Chinese peoples account for 1.5 per cent of the population, with Arabs comprising 1.3 per cent. A further 4.9 per cent are classified as ""Other Asian"".[223] 15.6 per cent of London's population are of Black and mixed-Black descent. 13.3 per cent are of full Black descent, with those of mixed-Black heritage comprising 2.3 per cent. Black Africans account for 7.0 per cent of London's population, with 4.2 per cent as Black Caribbean and 2.1 per cent as ""Other Black"". 5.0 per cent are of mixed race.[223] As of 2007, Black and Asian children outnumbered White British children by about six to four in state schools across London.[224] Altogether at the 2011 census, of London's 1,624,768 population aged 0 to 15, 46.4 per cent were White, 19.8 per cent were Asian, 19 per cent were Black, 10.8 per cent were Mixed and 4 per cent represented another ethnic group.[225] In January 2005, a survey of London's ethnic and religious diversity claimed that there were more than 300 languages spoken in London and more than 50 non-indigenous communities with a population of more than 10,000.[226] Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that, in 2010[update], London's foreign-born population was 2,650,000 (33 per cent), up from 1,630,000 in 1997. The 2011 census showed that 36.7 per cent of Greater London's population were born outside the UK.[227] A portion of the German-born population are likely to be British nationals born to parents serving in the British Armed Forces in Germany.[228] Estimates produced by the Office for National Statistics indicate that the five largest foreign-born groups living in London in the period July 2009 to June 2010 were those born in India, Poland, the Republic of Ireland, Bangladesh and Nigeria.[229] Religion Main article: Religion in London Religion in London (2011 census)[230] Religion Percent(%) Christian 48.4% No religion 20.7% Muslim 12.4% Undeclared 8.5% Hindu 5.0% Jewish 1.8% Sikh 1.5% Buddhist 1.0% Other 0.6% According to the 2011 Census, the largest religious groupings are Christians (48.4 per cent), followed by those of no religion (20.7 per cent), Muslims (12.4 per cent), no response (8.5 per cent), Hindus (5.0 per cent), Jews (1.8 per cent), Sikhs (1.5 per cent), Buddhists (1.0 per cent) and other (0.6 per cent). London has traditionally been Christian, and has a large number of churches, particularly in the City of London. The well-known St Paul's Cathedral in the City and Southwark Cathedral south of the river are Anglican administrative centres,[231] while the Archbishop of Canterbury, principal bishop of the Church of England and worldwide Anglican Communion, has his main residence at Lambeth Palace in the London Borough of Lambeth.[232] St Paul's Cathedral, the seat of the Bishop of LondonThe BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir London is the second-largest Hindu temple in England and Europe. Important national and royal ceremonies are shared between St Paul's and Westminster Abbey.[233] The Abbey is not to be confused with nearby Westminster Cathedral, which is the largest Roman Catholic cathedral in England and Wales.[234] Despite the prevalence of Anglican churches, observance is very low within the Anglican denomination. Church attendance continues on a long, slow, steady decline, according to Church of England statistics.[235] London is also home to sizeable Muslim, Hindu, Sikh, and Jewish communities. Notable mosques include the East London Mosque in Tower Hamlets, which is allowed to give the Islamic call to prayer through loudspeakers, the London Central Mosque on the edge of Regent's Park[236] and the Baitul Futuh of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. Following the oil boom, increasing numbers of wealthy Middle-Eastern Arab Muslims have based themselves around Mayfair, Kensington, and Knightsbridge in West London.[237][238][239] There are large Bengali Muslim communities in the eastern boroughs of Tower Hamlets and Newham.[240] Large Hindu communities are in the north-western boroughs of Harrow and Brent, the latter of which hosts what was, until 2006,[241] Europe's largest Hindu temple, Neasden Temple.[242] London is also home to 44 Hindu temples, including the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir London. There are Sikh communities in East and West London, particularly in Southall, home to one of the largest Sikh populations and the largest Sikh temple outside India.[243] The majority of British Jews live in London, with significant Jewish communities in Stamford Hill, Stanmore, Golders Green, Finchley, Hampstead, Hendon and Edgware in North London. Bevis Marks Synagogue in the City of London is affiliated to London's historic Sephardic Jewish community. It is the only synagogue in Europe which has held regular services continuously for over 300 years. Stanmore and Canons Park Synagogue has the largest membership of any single Orthodox synagogue in the whole of Europe, overtaking Ilford synagogue (also in London) in 1998.[244] The community set up the London Jewish Forum in 2006 in response to the growing significance of devolved London Government.[245] Accents Cockney is an accent heard across London, mainly spoken by working-class and lower-middle class Londoners. It is mainly attributed to the East End and wider East London, having originated there in the eighteenth century, although it has been suggested that the Cockney style of speech is much older.[246] John Camden Hotten, in his Slang Dictionary of 1859, makes reference to ""their use of a peculiar slang language"" when describing the costermongers of the East End. Since the turn of the century the Cockney dialect is less common in parts of the East End itself, with modern strongholds including other parts of London and suburbs in the home counties.[247][248] Estuary English is an intermediate accent between Cockney and Received Pronunciation.[249] It is widely spoken by people of all classes in London and south-eastern England, associated with the River Thames and its estuary.[250] Multicultural London English (MLE) is a multiethnolect becoming increasingly common in multicultural areas amongst young, working-class people from diverse backgrounds. It is a fusion of an array of ethnic accents, in particular Afro-Caribbean and South Asian, with a significant Cockney influence.[251] Received Pronunciation (RP) is the accent traditionally regarded as the standard for British English.[252] It has no specific geographical correlate,[253] although it is also traditionally defined as the standard speech used in London and south-eastern England.[254] It is mainly spoken by upper-class and upper-middle class Londoners.[255][256] Economy Main article: Economy of London The City of London, one of the largest financial centres in the world[257] London's gross regional product in 2018 was almost £500 billion, around a quarter of UK GDP.[258] London has five major business districts: the city, Westminster, Canary Wharf, Camden & Islington and Lambeth & Southwark. One way to get an idea of their relative importance is to look at relative amounts of office space: Greater London had 27 million m2 of office space in 2001, and the City contains the most space, with 8 million m2 of office space. London has some of the highest real estate prices in the world.[259][260] London is the world's most expensive office market for the last three years according to world property journal (2015) report.[261] As of 2015[update] the residential property in London is worth $2.2 trillion—the same value as that of Brazil's annual GDP.[262] The city has the highest property prices of any European city according to the Office for National Statistics and the European Office of Statistics.[263] On average the price per square metre in central London is €24,252 (April 2014). This is higher than the property prices in other G8 European capital cities; Berlin €3,306, Rome €6,188 and Paris €11,229.[264] The City of London The London Stock Exchange at Paternoster Square and Temple Bar London's finance industry is based in the City of London and Canary Wharf, the two major business districts in London. London is one of the pre-eminent financial centres of the world as the most important location for international finance.[265][266] London took over as a major financial centre shortly after 1795 when the Dutch Republic collapsed before the Napoleonic armies. For many bankers established in Amsterdam (e.g. Hope, Baring), this was only time to move to London. The London financial elite was strengthened by a strong Jewish community from all over Europe capable of mastering the most sophisticated financial tools of the time.[83] This unique concentration of talents accelerated the transition from the Commercial Revolution to the Industrial Revolution. By the end of the 19th century, Britain was the wealthiest of all nations, and London a leading financial centre. Still, as of 2016[update] London tops the world rankings on the Global Financial Centres Index (GFCI),[267] and it ranked second in A.T. Kearney's 2018 Global Cities Index.[268] A view from Westminster Millennium Pier on the River Thames, December 2018 London's largest industry is finance, and its financial exports make it a large contributor to the UK's balance of payments. Around 325,000 people were employed in financial services in London until mid-2007. London has over 480 overseas banks, more than any other city in the world. It is also the world's biggest currency trading centre, accounting for some 37 per cent of the $5.1 trillion average daily volume, according to the BIS.[269] Over 85 per cent (3.2 million) of the employed population of greater London works in the services industries. Because of its prominent global role, London's economy had been affected by the financial crisis of 2007–2008. However, by 2010 the city had recovered, put in place new regulatory powers, proceeded to regain lost ground and re-established London's economic dominance.[270] Along with professional services headquarters, the City of London is home to the Bank of England, London Stock Exchange, and Lloyd's of London insurance market. Over half of the UK's top 100 listed companies (the FTSE 100) and over 100 of Europe's 500 largest companies have their headquarters in central London. Over 70 per cent of the FTSE 100 are within London's metropolitan area, and 75 per cent of Fortune 500 companies have offices in London.[271] Media and technology Media companies are concentrated in London and the media distribution industry is London's second most competitive sector.[272] The BBC is a significant employer, while other broadcasters also have headquarters around the city. Many national newspapers are edited in London. London is a major retail centre and in 2010 had the highest non-food retail sales of any city in the world, with a total spend of around £64.2 billion.[273] The Port of London is the second-largest in the United Kingdom, handling 45 million tonnes of cargo each year.[274] A growing number of technology companies are based in London notably in East London Tech City, also known as Silicon Roundabout. In April 2014, the city was among the first to receive a geoTLD.[275][276][277] In February 2014 London was ranked as the European City of the Future[278] in the 2014/15 list by FDi Magazine.[279] The gas and electricity distribution networks that manage and operate the towers, cables and pressure systems that deliver energy to consumers across the city are managed by National Grid plc, SGN[280] and UK Power Networks.[281] Tourism Main article: Tourism in London The British MuseumThe National Gallery London is one of the leading tourist destinations in the world and in 2015 was ranked as the most visited city in the world with over 65 million visits.[282][283] It is also the top city in the world by visitor cross-border spending, estimated at US$20.23 billion in 2015.[284] Tourism is one of London's prime industries, employing 700,000 full-time workers in 2016, and contributes £36 billion a year to the economy.[285] The city accounts for 54% of all inbound visitor spending in the UK.[286] As of 2016[update] London was the world top city destination as ranked by TripAdvisor users.[287] In 2015 the top most-visited attractions in the UK were all in London. The top 10 most visited attractions were: (with visits per venue)[288] The British Museum: 6,820,686 The National Gallery: 5,908,254 The Natural History Museum (South Kensington): 5,284,023 The Southbank Centre: 5,102,883 Tate Modern: 4,712,581 The Victoria and Albert Museum (South Kensington): 3,432,325 The Science Museum: 3,356,212 Somerset House: 3,235,104 The Tower of London: 2,785,249 The National Portrait Gallery: 2,145,486 The number of hotel rooms in London in 2015 stood at 138,769, and is expected to grow over the years.[289] Transport Main articles: Transport in London and Infrastructure in London Journeys in Greater London by mode from 1997 to 2018[290] Black London taxis Transport is one of the four main areas of policy administered by the Mayor of London,[291] however the mayor's financial control does not extend to the longer distance rail network that enters London. In 2007 the Mayor of London assumed responsibility for some local lines, which now form the London Overground network, adding to the existing responsibility for the London Underground, trams and buses. The public transport network is administered by Transport for London (TfL).[292] The lines that formed the London Underground, as well as trams and buses, became part of an integrated transport system in 1933 when the London Passenger Transport Board or London Transport was created. Transport for London is now the statutory corporation responsible for most aspects of the transport system in Greater London, and is run by a board and a commissioner appointed by the Mayor of London.[293] Aviation Main article: Airports of London London Heathrow Airport is the busiest airport in Europe as well as the second busiest in the world for international passenger traffic. (Terminal 5C is pictured.) London is a major international air transport hub with the busiest city airspace in the world. Eight airports use the word London in their name, but most traffic passes through six of these. Additionally, various other airports also serve London, catering primarily to general aviation flights. London Heathrow Airport, in Hillingdon, West London, was for many years the busiest airport in the world for international traffic, and is the major hub of the nation's flag carrier, British Airways.[294] In March 2008 its fifth terminal was opened.[295] In 2014, Dubai gained from Heathrow the leading position in terms of international passenger traffic.[296] London Gatwick Airport,[297] south of London in West Sussex, handles flights to more destinations than any other UK airport[298] and is the main base of easyJet,[299] the UK's largest airline by number of passengers.[300] London Stansted Airport,[301] north-east of London in Essex, has flights that serve the greatest number of European destinations of any UK airport[302] and is the main base of Ryanair,[303] the world's largest international airline by number of international passengers.[304] London Luton Airport, to the north of London in Bedfordshire, is used by several budget airlines for short-haul flights.[305] London City Airport, the most central airport and the one with the shortest runway, in Newham, East London, is focused on business travellers, with a mixture of full-service short-haul scheduled flights and considerable business jet traffic.[306] London Southend Airport, east of London in Essex, is a smaller, regional airport that caters for short-haul flights on a limited, though growing, number of airlines.[307] In 2017, international passengers made up over 95% of the total at Southend, the highest proportion of any London airport.[308] Rail Underground and DLR The London Underground is the world's oldest and third-longest rapid transit system. The London Underground, commonly referred to as the Tube, is the oldest[309] and third longest[310] metro system in the world. The system serves 270 stations[311] and was formed from several private companies, including the world's first underground electric line, the City and South London Railway.[312] It dates from 1863.[313] Over four million journeys are made every day on the Underground network, over 1 billion each year.[314] An investment programme is attempting to reduce congestion and improve reliability, including £6.5 billion (€7.7 billion) spent before the 2012 Summer Olympics.[315] The Docklands Light Railway (DLR), which opened in 1987, is a second, more local metro system using smaller and lighter tram-type vehicles that serve the Docklands, Greenwich and Lewisham. Suburban There are more than 360 railway stations in the London Travelcard Zones on an extensive above-ground suburban railway network. South London, particularly, has a high concentration of railways as it has fewer Underground lines. Most rail lines terminate around the centre of London, running into eighteen terminal stations, with the exception of the Thameslink trains connecting Bedford in the north and Brighton in the south via Luton and Gatwick airports.[316] London has Britain's busiest station by number of passengers—Waterloo, with over 184 million people using the interchange station complex (which includes Waterloo East station) each year.[317][318] Clapham Junction is the busiest station in Europe by the number of trains passing. With the need for more rail capacity in London, Crossrail is expected to open in 2021.[319] It will be a new railway line running east to west through London and into the Home Counties with a branch to Heathrow Airport.[320] It is Europe's biggest construction project, with a £15 billion projected cost.[321][322] Inter-city and international St Pancras International is the main terminal for high-speed Eurostar and High Speed 1 services, as well as commuter suburban Thameslink and inter-city East Midlands Railway services. London is the centre of the National Rail network, with 70 per cent of rail journeys starting or ending in London.[323] King's Cross station and Euston station, which are both in London, are the starting points of the East Coast Main Line and the West Coast Main Line—the two main railway lines in Britain—respectively. Like suburban rail services, regional and inter-city trains depart from several termini around the city centre, linking London with the rest of Britain including Aberdeen, Birmingham, Blackpool, Bradford, Brighton, Bristol, Cambridge, Cardiff, Carlisle, Chester, Coventry, Crewe, Derby, Doncaster, Dover, Edinburgh, Exeter, Glasgow, Holyhead (for Dublin), Hull, Lancaster, Leeds, Liverpool, Nottingham, Manchester, Newcastle upon Tyne, Norwich, Oxford, Peterborough, Plymouth, Portsmouth, Preston, Reading, Sheffield, Southampton, Sunderland, Stevenage, Swansea, Wolverhampton and York.[324] London also has convenient rail connections with airports out of Greater London. These airports include Birmingham Airport (via Birmingham International railway station), East Midlands Airport (via East Midlands Parkway railway station), Inverness Airport (via Inverness railway station), Leeds Bradford Airport (via Bradford Interchange or Leeds railway station) and Liverpool John Lennon Airport (via Liverpool South Parkway railway station).[324] Some international railway services to Continental Europe were operated during the 20th century as boat trains, such as the Admiraal de Ruijter to Amsterdam and the Night Ferry to Paris and Brussels. The opening of the Channel Tunnel in 1994 connected London directly to the continental rail network, allowing Eurostar services to begin. Since 2007, high-speed trains link St. Pancras International with Lille, Calais, Paris, Disneyland Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam and other European tourist destinations via the High Speed 1 rail link and the Channel Tunnel.[325] The first high-speed domestic trains started in June 2009 linking Kent to London.[326] There are plans for a second high speed line linking London to the Midlands, North West England, and Yorkshire. Freight Although rail freight levels are far down compared to their height, significant quantities of cargo are also carried into and out of London by rail; chiefly building materials and landfill waste. As a major hub of the British railway network, London's tracks also carry large amounts of freight for the other regions, such as container freight from the Channel Tunnel and English Channel ports, and nuclear waste for reprocessing at Sellafield.[327] Buses, coaches and trams A red double-decker bus London's bus network runs 24 hours a day, with about 9,300 vehicles, more than 675 bus routes and around 19,000 bus stops.[328] In 2019/20, the network had more than 2 billion commuter trips per year.[329] Since 2010 and average of £1.2 billion is taken in revenue each year.[330] London has one of the largest wheelchair-accessible networks in the world[331] and from the third quarter of 2007, became more accessible to hearing and visually impaired passengers as audio-visual announcements were introduced.[332] London's coach hub is Victoria Coach Station, an Art Deco building opened in 1932. The coach station was initially run by a group of coach companies under the name of London Coastal Coaches; however, in 1970 the service and station were included in the nationalisation of the country's coach services, becoming part of the National Bus Company. In 1988, the coach station was purchased by London Transport which then became Transport for London. Victoria Coach Station has weekly passenger numbers of over 200,000 and provides services across the UK and Europe.[333][failed verification] London has a modern tram network, known as Tramlink, centred on Croydon in South London. The network has 39 stops and four routes, and carried 28 million people in 2013.[334][335] Since June 2008, Transport for London has completely owned and operated Tramlink.[336] Cable car London's first and to date only cable car is the Emirates Air Line, which opened in June 2012. The cable car crosses the River Thames, and links Greenwich Peninsula and the Royal Docks in the east of the city. It is integrated with London's Oyster Card ticketing system, although the Emirates Air Line fares are not included in the Oyster daily capping.[337] It cost £60 million to build and can carry up to 2,500 passengers per hour in each direction at peak times. Similar to the Santander Cycles bike hire scheme, the cable car is sponsored in a 10-year deal by the airline Emirates.[338] Cycling Main article: Cycling in London Santander Cycle Hire near Victoria in Central London In the Greater London Area, around 670,000 people use a bike every day,[339] meaning around 7% of the total population of around 8.8 million use a bike on an average day.[340][341] This relatively low percentage of bicycle users may be due to the poor investments for cycling in London of about £110 million per year,[342] equating to around £12 per person, which can be compared to £22 in the Netherlands.[343] Cycling has become an increasingly popular way to get around London. The launch of a bicycle hire scheme in July 2010 was successful and generally well received.[344] Port and river boats The Port of London, once the largest in the world, is now only the second-largest in the United Kingdom, handling 45 million tonnes of cargo each year as of 2009.[274] Most of this cargo passes through the Port of Tilbury, outside the boundary of Greater London.[274] London has river boat services on the Thames known as Thames Clippers, which offer both commuter and tourist boat services.[345] At major piers including Canary Wharf, London Bridge City, Battersea Power Station and London Eye (Waterloo), services depart at least every 20 minutes during commuter times.[346] The Woolwich Ferry, with 2.5 million passengers every year, is a frequent service linking the North and South Circular Roads.[347] Roads Although the majority of journeys in central London are made by public transport, car travel is common in the suburbs. The inner ring road (around the city centre), the North and South Circular roads (just within the suburbs), and the outer orbital motorway (the M25, just outside the built-up area in most places) encircle the city and are intersected by a number of busy radial routes—but very few motorways penetrate into inner London. A plan for a comprehensive network of motorways throughout the city (the Ringways Plan) was prepared in the 1960s but was mostly cancelled in the early 1970s.[348] The M25 is the second-longest ring-road motorway in Europe at 117 mi (188 km) long.[349] The A1 and M1 connect London to Leeds, and Newcastle and Edinburgh. London is notorious for its traffic congestion; in 2009, the average speed of a car in the rush hour was recorded at 10.6 mph (17.1 km/h).[350] In 2003, a congestion charge was introduced to reduce traffic volumes in the city centre. With a few exceptions, motorists are required to pay to drive within a defined zone encompassing much of central London.[351] Motorists who are residents of the defined zone can buy a greatly reduced season pass.[352][353] The London government initially expected the Congestion Charge Zone to increase daily peak period Underground and bus users, reduce road traffic, increase traffic speeds, and reduce queues;[354] however, the increase in private for hire vehicles has affected these expectations. Over the course of several years, the average number of cars entering the centre of London on a weekday was reduced from 195,000 to 125,000 cars – a 35-per-cent reduction of vehicles driven per day.[355][356] Education Main article: Education in London Tertiary education Imperial College London, a technical research university in South Kensington See also: List of universities and higher education colleges in London London is a major global centre of higher education teaching and research and has the largest concentration of higher education institutes in Europe.[22] According to the QS World University Rankings 2015/16, London has the greatest concentration of top class universities in the world[357][358] and its international student population of around 110,000 is larger than any other city in the world.[359] A 2014 PricewaterhouseCoopers report termed London the global capital of higher education.[360] King's College London, established by Royal Charter in 1829, is one of the founding colleges of the University of London. A number of world-leading education institutions are based in London. In the 2021 QS World University Rankings, Imperial College London is ranked #8 in the world, University College London (UCL) is ranked 10th, and King's College London (KCL) is ranked 31st.[361] The London School of Economics has been described as the world's leading social science institution for both teaching and research.[362] The London Business School is considered one of the world's leading business schools and in 2015 its MBA programme was ranked second-best in the world by the Financial Times.[363] The city is also home to three of the world's top ten performing arts schools (as ranked by the 2020 QS World University Rankings[364]): the Royal College of Music (ranking 2nd in the world), the Royal Academy of Music (ranking 4th) and the Guildhall School of Music and Drama (ranking 6th). With students in London[365] and around 48,000 in University of London Worldwide,[366] the federal University of London is the largest contact teaching university in the UK.[367] It includes five multi-faculty universities – City, King's College London, Queen Mary, Royal Holloway and UCL – and a number of smaller and more specialised institutions including Birkbeck, the Courtauld Institute of Art, Goldsmiths, the London Business School, the London School of Economics, the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, the Royal Academy of Music, the Central School of Speech and Drama, the Royal Veterinary College and the School of Oriental and African Studies.[368] Members of the University of London have their own admissions procedures, and most award their own degrees. A number of universities in London are outside the University of London system, including Brunel University, Imperial College London,[note 6] Kingston University, London Metropolitan University,[369] University of East London, University of West London, University of Westminster, London South Bank University, Middlesex University, and University of the Arts London (the largest university of art, design, fashion, communication and the performing arts in Europe).[370] In addition there are three international universities in London – Regent's University London, Richmond, The American International University in London and Schiller International University. The front façade of the Royal College of Music London is home to five major medical schools – Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry (part of Queen Mary), King's College London School of Medicine (the largest medical school in Europe), Imperial College School of Medicine, UCL Medical School and St George's, University of London – and has many affiliated teaching hospitals. It is also a major centre for biomedical research, and three of the UK's eight academic health science centres are based in the city – Imperial College Healthcare, King's Health Partners and UCL Partners (the largest such centre in Europe).[371] Additionally, many biomedical and biotechnology spin out companies from these research institutions are based around the city, most prominently in White City.There are a number of business schools in London, including the London School of Business and Finance, Cass Business School (part of City University London), Hult International Business School, ESCP Europe, European Business School London, Imperial College Business School, the London Business School and the UCL School of Management.

Primary and secondary education The majority of primary and secondary schools and further-education colleges in London are controlled by the London boroughs or otherwise state-funded; leading examples include Ashbourne College, Bethnal Green Academy, Brampton Manor Academy, City and Islington College, City of Westminster College, David Game College, Ealing, Hammersmith and West London College, Leyton Sixth Form College, London Academy of Excellence, Tower Hamlets College, and Newham Collegiate Sixth Form Centre. There are also a number of private schools and colleges in London, some old and famous, such as City of London School, Harrow, St Paul's School, Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School, University College School, The John Lyon School, Highgate School and Westminster School. Culture Main article: Culture of London Leisure and entertainment See also: List of annual events in London and West End theatre Piccadilly Circus Leisure is a major part of the London economy. A 2003 report attributed a quarter of the entire UK leisure economy to London[372] at 25.6 events per 1000 people.[373] Globally the city is one of the big four fashion capitals of the world, and according to official statistics, it is the world's third-busiest film production centre, presents more live comedy than any other city,[374] and has the biggest theatre audience of any city in the world.[375] Harrods in Knightsbridge Within the City of Westminster in London, the entertainment district of the West End has its focus around Leicester Square, where London and world film premieres are held, and Piccadilly Circus, with its giant electronic advertisements.[376] London's theatre district is here, as are many cinemas, bars, clubs, and restaurants, including the city's Chinatown district (in Soho), and just to the east is Covent Garden, an area housing speciality shops. The city is the home of Andrew Lloyd Webber, whose musicals have dominated the West End theatre since the late 20th century.[377] The United Kingdom's Royal Ballet, English National Ballet, Royal Opera, and English National Opera are based in London and perform at the Royal Opera House, the London Coliseum, Sadler's Wells Theatre, and the Royal Albert Hall, as well as touring the country.[378] Scene of the annual Notting Hill Carnival, 2014 Islington's 1 mile (1.6 km) long Upper Street, extending northwards from Angel, has more bars and restaurants than any other street in the United Kingdom.[379] Europe's busiest shopping area is Oxford Street, a shopping street nearly 1 mile (1.6 km) long, making it the longest shopping street in the UK. Oxford Street is home to vast numbers of retailers and department stores, including the world-famous Selfridges flagship store.[380] Knightsbridge, home to the equally renowned Harrods department store, lies to the south-west. London is home to designers Vivienne Westwood, Galliano, Stella McCartney, Manolo Blahnik, and Jimmy Choo, among others; its renowned art and fashion schools make it an international centre of fashion alongside Paris, Milan, and New York City. London offers a great variety of cuisine as a result of its ethnically diverse population. Gastronomic centres include the Bangladeshi restaurants of Brick Lane and the Chinese restaurants of Chinatown.[381] Shakespeare's Globe is a modern reconstruction of the Globe Theatre on the south bank of the River Thames. There is a variety of annual events, beginning with the relatively new New Year's Day Parade, a fireworks display at the London Eye; the world's second largest street party, the Notting Hill Carnival, is held on the late August Bank Holiday each year. Traditional parades include November's Lord Mayor's Show, a centuries-old event celebrating the annual appointment of a new Lord Mayor of the City of London with a procession along the streets of the city, and June's Trooping the Colour, a formal military pageant performed by regiments of the Commonwealth and British armies to celebrate the Queen's Official Birthday.[382] The Boishakhi Mela is a Bengali New Year festival celebrated by the British Bangladeshi community. It is the largest open-air Asian festival in Europe. After the Notting Hill Carnival, it is the second-largest street festival in the United Kingdom attracting over 80,000 visitors from across the country.[383] Literature, film and television Main articles: London in fiction, London in film, List of television shows set in London, and London Television Archive Sherlock Holmes Museum in Baker Street, bearing the number 221B London has been the setting for many works of literature. The pilgrims in Geoffrey Chaucer's late 14th-century Canterbury Tales set out for Canterbury from London—specifically, from the Tabard inn, Southwark. William Shakespeare spent a large part of his life living and working in London; his contemporary Ben Jonson was also based there, and some of his work, most notably his play The Alchemist, was set in the city.[384] A Journal of the Plague Year (1722) by Daniel Defoe is a fictionalisation of the events of the 1665 Great Plague.[384] The literary centres of London have traditionally been hilly Hampstead and (since the early 20th century) Bloomsbury. Writers closely associated with the city are the diarist Samuel Pepys, noted for his eyewitness account of the Great Fire; Charles Dickens, whose representation of a foggy, snowy, grimy London of street sweepers and pickpockets has been a major influence on people's vision of early Victorian London; and Virginia Woolf, regarded as one of the foremost modernist literary figures of the 20th century.[384] Later important depictions of London from the 19th and early 20th centuries are Dickens' novels, and Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories.[384] Also of significance is Letitia Elizabeth Landon's Calendar of the London Seasons (1834). Modern writers pervasively influenced by the city include Peter Ackroyd, author of a ""biography"" of London, and Iain Sinclair, who writes in the genre of psychogeography. Wikisource has original text related to this article: 'Calendar of the London Seasons', by L. E. L. Keats House, where Keats wrote his Ode to a Nightingale. The village of Hampstead has historically been a literary centre in London. London has played a significant role in the film industry. Major studios within or bordering London include Twickenham, Ealing, Shepperton, Pinewood, Elstree and Borehamwood,[385] and a special effects and post-production community centred in Soho. Working Title Films has its headquarters in London.[386] London has been the setting for films including Oliver Twist (1948), Scrooge (1951), Peter Pan (1953), The 101 Dalmatians (1961), My Fair Lady (1964), Mary Poppins (1964), Blowup (1966), The Long Good Friday (1980), The Great Mouse Detective (1986), Notting Hill (1999), Love Actually (2003), V For Vendetta (2005), Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2008) and The King's Speech (2010).

London is a major centre for television production, with studios including BBC Television Centre, The Fountain Studios and The London Studios. Many television programmes have been set in London, including the popular television soap opera EastEnders, broadcast by the BBC since 1985. Museums, art galleries and libraries Aerial view of Albertopolis. Albert Memorial, Royal Albert Hall, Royal Geographical Society and Royal College of Art are visible near the top; Victoria and Albert Museum and Natural History Museum at the lower end; Imperial College, Royal College of Music, and Science Museum lying in between. London is home to many museums, galleries, and other institutions, many of which are free of admission charges and are major tourist attractions as well as playing a research role. The first of these to be established was the British Museum in Bloomsbury, in 1753.[387] Originally containing antiquities, natural history specimens, and the national library, the museum now has 7 million artefacts from around the globe. In 1824, the National Gallery was founded to house the British national collection of Western paintings; this now occupies a prominent position in Trafalgar Square. The British Library is the second largest library in the world, and the national library of the United Kingdom.[388][389][390] There are many other research libraries, including the Wellcome Library and Dana Centre, as well as university libraries, including the British Library of Political and Economic Science at LSE, the Central Library at Imperial, the Maughan Library at King's, and the Senate House Libraries at the University of London.[391][392] In the latter half of the 19th century the locale of South Kensington was developed as ""Albertopolis"", a cultural and scientific quarter. Three major national museums are there: the Victoria and Albert Museum (for the applied arts), the Natural History Museum, and the Science Museum. The National Portrait Gallery was founded in 1856 to house depictions of figures from British history; its holdings now comprise the world's most extensive collection of portraits.[393] The national gallery of British art is at Tate Britain, originally established as an annexe of the National Gallery in 1897. The Tate Gallery, as it was formerly known, also became a major centre for modern art. In 2000, this collection moved to Tate Modern, a new gallery housed in the former Bankside Power Station, which was built by the Basel-based architecture firm of Herzog & de Meuron.[394] Music London is one of the major classical and popular music capitals of the world and hosts major music corporations, such as Universal Music Group International and Warner Music Group, as well as countless bands, musicians and industry professionals. The city is also home to many orchestras and concert halls, such as the Barbican Arts Centre (principal base of the London Symphony Orchestra and the London Symphony Chorus), the Southbank Centre (London Philharmonic Orchestra and the Philharmonia Orchestra), Cadogan Hall (Royal Philharmonic Orchestra) and the Royal Albert Hall (The Proms).[378] London's two main opera houses are the Royal Opera House and the London Coliseum (home to the English National Opera).[378] The UK's largest pipe organ is at the Royal Albert Hall. Other significant instruments are at the cathedrals and major churches. Several conservatoires are within the city: Royal Academy of Music, Royal College of Music, Guildhall School of Music and Drama and Trinity Laban. London has numerous venues for rock and pop concerts, including the world's busiest indoor venue, The O2 Arena[395] and Wembley Arena, as well as many mid-sized venues, such as Brixton Academy, the Hammersmith Apollo and the Shepherd's Bush Empire.[378] Several music festivals, including the Wireless Festival, South West Four, Lovebox, and Hyde Park's British Summer Time are all held in London.[396] The city is home to the original Hard Rock Cafe and the Abbey Road Studios, where The Beatles recorded many of their hits. In the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, musicians and groups like Elton John, Pink Floyd, Cliff Richard, David Bowie, Queen, The Kinks, The Rolling Stones, The Who, Eric Clapton, Led Zeppelin, The Small Faces, Iron Maiden, Fleetwood Mac, Elvis Costello, Cat Stevens, The Police, The Cure, Madness, The Jam, Ultravox, Spandau Ballet, Culture Club, Dusty Springfield, Phil Collins, Rod Stewart, Adam Ant, Status Quo and Sade, derived their sound from the streets and rhythms of London.[397] London was instrumental in the development of punk music, with figures such as the Sex Pistols, The Clash, and Vivienne Westwood all based in the city.[398][399] More recent artists to emerge from the London music scene include George Michael's Wham!, Kate Bush, Seal, the Pet Shop Boys, Bananarama, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Bush, the Spice Girls, Jamiroquai, Blur, McFly, The Prodigy, Gorillaz, Bloc Party, Mumford & Sons, Coldplay, Amy Winehouse, Adele, Sam Smith, Ed Sheeran, Paloma Faith, Ellie Goulding, One Direction and Florence and the Machine.[400][401][402] London is also a centre for urban music. In particular the genres UK garage, drum and bass, dubstep and grime evolved in the city from the foreign genres of house, hip hop, and reggae, alongside local drum and bass. Music station BBC Radio 1Xtra was set up to support the rise of local urban contemporary music both in London and in the rest of the United Kingdom. The Royal Albert Hall hosts concerts and musical events. Abbey Road Studios, 3 Abbey Road, St John's Wood, City of Westminster Recreation Parks and open spaces Main articles: Parks and open spaces in London and Royal Parks of London See also: List of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Greater London and List of local nature reserves in Greater London A 2013 report by the City of London Corporation said that London is the ""greenest city"" in Europe with 35,000 acres of public parks, woodlands and gardens.[403] The largest parks in the central area of London are three of the eight Royal Parks, namely Hyde Park and its neighbour Kensington Gardens in the west, and Regent's Park to the north.[404] Hyde Park in particular is popular for sports and sometimes hosts open-air concerts. Regent's Park contains London Zoo, the world's oldest scientific zoo, and is near Madame Tussauds Wax Museum.[405][406] Primrose Hill, immediately to the north of Regent's Park, at 256 feet (78 m)[407] is a popular spot from which to view the city skyline. Close to Hyde Park are smaller Royal Parks, Green Park and St. James's Park.[408] A number of large parks lie outside the city centre, including Hampstead Heath and the remaining Royal Parks of Greenwich Park to the southeast[409] and Bushy Park and Richmond Park (the largest) to the southwest,[410][411] Hampton Court Park is also a royal park, but, because it contains a palace, it is administered by the Historic Royal Palaces, unlike the eight Royal Parks.[412] Close to Richmond Park is Kew Gardens, which has the world's largest collection of living plants. In 2003, the gardens were put on the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites.[413] There are also parks administered by London's borough Councils, including Victoria Park in the East End and Battersea Park in the centre. Some more informal, semi-natural open spaces also exist, including the 320-hectare (790-acre) Hampstead Heath of North London,[414] and Epping Forest, which covers 2,476 hectares (6,118 acres)[415] in the east. Both are controlled by the City of London Corporation.[416][417] Hampstead Heath incorporates Kenwood House, a former stately home and a popular location in the summer months when classical musical concerts are held by the lake, attracting thousands of people every weekend to enjoy the music, scenery and fireworks.[418] Epping Forest is a popular venue for various outdoor activities, including mountain biking, walking, horse riding, golf, angling, and orienteering.[419] Walking Walking is a popular recreational activity in London. Areas that provide for walks include Wimbledon Common, Epping Forest, Hampton Court Park, Hampstead Heath, the eight Royal Parks, canals and disused railway tracks.[420] Access to canals and rivers has improved recently, including the creation of the Thames Path, some 28 miles (45 km) of which is within Greater London, and The Wandle Trail; this runs 12 miles (19 km) through South London along the River Wandle, a tributary of the River Thames.[421] Other long-distance paths, linking green spaces, have also been created, including the Capital Ring, the Green Chain Walk, London Outer Orbital Path (""Loop""), Jubilee Walkway, Lea Valley Walk, and the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Walk.[420] Aerial view of Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens St. James's Park lake with the London Eye in the distance The River Wandle, Carshalton, in the London Borough of Sutton Sport Main article: Sport in London London has hosted the Summer Olympics three times: in 1908, 1948, and 2012,[422][423] making it the first city to host the modern Games three times.[24] The city was also the host of the British Empire Games in 1934.[424] In 2017, London hosted the World Championships in Athletics for the first time.[425] London's most popular sport is football and it has six clubs in the English Premier League as of the 2021–22 season: Arsenal, Brentford, Chelsea, Crystal Palace, Tottenham Hotspur, and West Ham United.[426] Other professional teams in London are AFC Wimbledon, Barnet, Bromley, Charlton Athletic, Dagenham & Redbridge, Fulham, Leyton Orient, Millwall, Queens Park Rangers and Sutton United. From 1924, the original Wembley Stadium was the home of the English national football team. It hosted the 1966 FIFA World Cup Final, with England defeating West Germany, and served as the venue for the FA Cup Final as well as rugby league's Challenge Cup final.[427] The new Wembley Stadium serves exactly the same purposes and has a capacity of 90,000.[428] Two Premiership Rugby union teams are based in London, Harlequins and London Irish.[429] Ealing Trailfinders, Richmond and Saracens play in the RFU Championship and other rugby union clubs in the city include London Scottish, Rosslyn Park F.C., Westcombe Park R.F.C., and Blackheath F.C.. Twickenham Stadium in south-west London hosts home matches for the England national rugby union team and has a capacity of 82,000 now that the new south stand has been completed.[430] While rugby league is more popular in the north of England, there are two professional rugby league clubs in London—the London Broncos in the second-tier RFL Championship, who play at the Trailfinders Sports Ground in West Ealing, and the third-tier League 1 team, the London Skolars from Wood Green, Haringey. One of London's best-known annual sports competitions is the Wimbledon Tennis Championships, held at the All England Club in the south-western suburb of Wimbledon.[431] Played in late June to early July, it is the oldest tennis tournament in the world, and widely considered the most prestigious.[432][433][434] London has two Test cricket grounds, Lord's (home of Middlesex C.C.C.) in St John's Wood[435] and the Oval (home of Surrey C.C.C.) in Kennington.[436] Lord's has hosted four finals of the Cricket World Cup and is known as the Home of Cricket.[437] Other key events are the annual mass-participation London Marathon, in which some 35,000 runners attempt a 26.2-mile (42.2 km) course around the city,[438] and the University Boat Race on the River Thames from Putney to Mortlake.[439] Wembley Stadium, home of the England football team, has a seating capacity of 90,000. It is the UK's biggest stadium.[440] Twickenham, home of the England rugby union team, has a seating capacity of 82,000. It is the world's largest rugby union stadium.[441] Centre Court at Wimbledon. First played in 1877, the Championships is the oldest tennis tournament in the world.[442] Notable people Main article: List of people from London See also London portal England portal United Kingdom portal Outline of England Outline of London Notes ^ City of London and Greater London ^ See also: Independent city § National capitals. ^ The London Mayor is not to be confused with the Lord Mayor of London, who heads the City of London Corporation, which administers the City of London. ^ According to the European Statistical Agency (Eurostat), London had the largest Larger Urban Zone in the EU.

IIED is one of a small group of independent, not-for-profit organisations that has provided core concepts and methods for thinking about sustainability and social change. IIED's main way of working is through partnership with like-minded organisations in Africa, Asia and Latin America. The institute's work is currently divided into four main areas: natural resources, climate change, human settlements and sustainable markets. IIED is based in central London on High Holborn and has an office in Edinburgh. It formerly had offices in Dakar, Senegal (now an independent organisation IED-Afrique) and Buenos Aires, Argentina (also an independent sister institution, IIED-America Latina). There was also an office in Washington DC, USA (until IIED North America merged with the World Resources Institute in 1988). The International Institute of Environment and Development has more than 140 employees and researchers from 16 countries. The organisation's Board of Trustees are all volunteers, currently 12 representatives from nine different countries. The working budget of the IIED, £18.4 million in 2019/20, is achieved through donations, grants and mutually beneficial partnerships.[2] Contents 1 History[3][4] 1.1 1970s 1.2 1980s 1.3 1990s 1.4 2000s 1.5 2010s 2 Current work 3 Directors 4 Publications 5 Barbara Ward Lectures 6 Impact 7 Funders 8 References 9 Further reading 10 External links History[3][4][edit] 1970s[edit] The origins of IIED can be found in the International Institute for Environmental Affairs (IIEA),[5] which was set up in New York in 1971 with backing from industrialist Robert O. Anderson and New York Times journalist Jack Raymond as founding president. In 1973, Barbara Ward was asked to become the organisation's first director, and agreed on the condition that development as well as an environmental agenda was integral to its mission. She moved the organisation to London and changed its name to IIED. IIEA had helped shape the agenda for the 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environment (also known as the Stockholm Conference), which led to the creation of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). Ward's book Only One Earth (co-authored with René Dubos), was the key text for delegates at that conference, where Ward introduced the term sustainable development to a global audience and highlighted the links between the environment and human wellbeing. IIED carried out research and lobbying work on a range of contemporary environment and development topics, using funds obtained from donor organisations and occasionally from corporations and foundations. It held its first symposium at the 1974 UN World Food Conference and in 1975 joined forces with UNEP to create Earthscan, an information and environment service for media. In 1976 it was heavily involved in HABITAT, the first UN Conference on Human Settlements. 1980s[edit] In 1985, IIED and the World Resources Institute (WRI) began to produce the biennial World Resources Report, which today is solely a WRI publication. In 1987, the Brundtland Report, also known as Our Common Future, cited IIED's contribution to creating ""a global agenda for change"". The institute's staff published a series of landmark books[4] including Africa in Crisis by Lloyd Timberlake (1986), The Greening of Africa by Paul Harrison (1987), and No Timber Without Trees by Duncan Poore (1989) and Squatter Citizen: Life in the Urban Third World by Jorge Hardoy and David Satterthwaite (1989). 1990s[edit] IIED played an important role ahead of the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, or Earth Summit, held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, by mobilising civil society and drawing international attention to the summit. For this, IIED was awarded the Blue Planet Prize. One of IIED's major projects of the 1990s was called ""Towards a Sustainable Paper Cycle"". 2000s[edit] In 2001, IIED set up a climate change programme, led by Dr Saleemul Huq. He and several other IIED researchers have served as lead authors or coordinating lead authors for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. IIED was active at Rio Earth Summit's follow-up conference, the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in 2002. Between 2000 and 2002, IIED led the Mining, Minerals and Sustainable Development (MMSD) project, a global review of the impacts and practices of the mining sector that engaged industry players and recommended improvements to their operations. In October 2008, the Independent newspaper cited then IIED director Camilla Toulmin as one of Britain's top 100 environmentalists.[6] 2010s[edit] In 2012, IIED organised a major conference ahead of the Rio+20 Summit in Brazil. Current work[edit] IIED continues to both conduct research with partners in dozens of countries and act on a global stage through processes such as various multilateral environmental negotiations. Directors[edit] IIED's founding director Barbara Ward died in 1981. She was succeeded by William Clark, Brian Walker, Richard Sandbrook, Nigel Cross, Camilla Toulmin and, currently, Andrew Norton, who took over in late June 2015. Publications[edit] IIED publishes a variety of reports, working papers, books, policy briefs and opinion papers, most of which are free to download as pdfs from its website. Its online presence has expanded to include social media applications in recent years. Its long-standing series include the international journal Environment and Urbanization and Gatekeeper, along with three discontinued series: Participatory Learning and Action (dealing with participatory research), Haramata (dealing with drylands development issues) and Tiempo (dealing with climate change impacts, long before interest was widespread). Until 1986 IIED, also ran Earthscan Publications until 2011 when it was taken over by Taylor and Francis. It has published many of IIED's books. Barbara Ward Lectures[edit] IIED organises the 'Barbara Ward Lectures' in memory of the institute's first director, who died in 1981. Previous speakers have included former President of Ireland Mary Robinson; Lindiwe Sisulu, Minister of Housing of the Republic of South Africa; Connie Hedegaard, European Commissioner for Climate Action; Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change; Fatima Denton, director of the Special Initiatives Division and leader of the African Climate Policy Centre of the UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA); Debra Roberts, head of the Sustainable and Resilient City Initiatives portfolio in eThekwini Municipality, Durban, South Africa; and former Prime Minister of Norway and Director-General of the World Health Organization Gro Harlem Brundtland. Impact[edit] IIED is generally acknowledged to be a successful organisation - its ideas are pragmatic and pro-poor, and it has helped to influence of major organisations including the World Bank, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, the Department for International Development of the UK government, and Scandinavian aid agencies like SIDA and DANIDA. For example, a former staff member, Gordon Conway, was partly responsible with Robert Chambers for developing participatory rural appraisal, a suite of largely visual techniques widely used in international and community development to elicit public views and ideas. IIED's Environmental Economics programme helped to develop some of the first 'green accounting' and eco-taxation techniques that are now used in government and industry. Richard Sandbrook lobbied some of the world's largest corporations to improve their environmental performance - notably in the mining sector.[4][7] Funders[edit] IIED lists its sources of financial support on an annual basis.finances</ref> Governments and government agencies Including: AusAid, GTZ, DFID, Defra, the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, IrishAid, the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation, Royal Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency, Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation.

Work on Mining, Minerals and Sustainable Development in the 2000s was operated separately from IIED offices to avoid corporate influence.[8] References[edit] ^ ""About - International Institute for Environment and Development"". www.iied.org. ^ IIED finances [1] ^ http://www.af-info.or.jp/en/blueplanet/doc/list/1992essay-iied.pdf ^ a b c Batterbury, SPJ. 2004.

Otherwise, the United Kingdom is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east, the English Channel to the south and the Celtic Sea to the south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea separates Great Britain and Ireland. The total area of the United Kingdom is 93,628 square miles (242,500 km2). The United Kingdom is a unitary parliamentary democracy and constitutional monarchy.[note 11][18][19] The monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, has reigned since 1952.[20] The capital is London, a global city and financial centre with an urban area population of 10.3 million.[21] The United Kingdom consists of four countries: England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.[22] Their capitals are London, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast, respectively. Other than England, the constituent countries have their own devolved governments, each with varying powers.[23][24][25] The United Kingdom has evolved from a series of annexations, unions and separations of constituent countries over several hundred years. The Treaty of Union between the Kingdom of England (which included Wales, annexed in 1542) and the Kingdom of Scotland in 1707 formed the Kingdom of Great Britain. Its union in 1801 with the Kingdom of Ireland created the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Most of Ireland seceded from the UK in 1922, leaving the present United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which formally adopted that name in 1927.[note 12] The nearby Isle of Man, Bailiwick of Guernsey and Jersey are not part of the UK, being Crown Dependencies with the British Government responsible for defence and international representation.[26] There are also 14 British Overseas Territories,[27] the last remnants of the British Empire which, at its height in the 1920s, encompassed almost a quarter of the world's landmass and a third of the world's population, and was the largest empire in history. British influence can be observed in the language, culture and the legal and political systems of many of its former colonies.[28][29][30][31][32] The United Kingdom has the world's fifth-largest economy by nominal gross domestic product (GDP), and the tenth-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP). It has a high-income economy and a very high human development index rating, ranking 13th in the world. The UK became the world's first industrialised country and was the world's foremost power during the 19th and early 20th centuries.[33][34] Today the UK remains one of the world's great powers, with considerable economic, cultural, military, scientific, technological and political influence internationally.[35][36] It is a recognised nuclear state and is ranked sixth globally in military expenditure.[37] It has been a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council since its first session in 1946. The United Kingdom is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the Council of Europe, the G7, the Group of Ten, the G20, the United Nations, NATO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Interpol, and the World Trade Organization (WTO). It was a member state of the European Economic Community (EEC) and its successor, the European Union (EU), from 1973 to its withdrawal in 2020.

Following the partition of Ireland and the independence of the Irish Free State in 1922, which left Northern Ireland as the only part of the island of Ireland within the United Kingdom, the name was changed to the ""United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland"".[44] Although the United Kingdom is a sovereign country, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are also widely referred to as countries.[45][46] The UK Prime Minister's website has used the phrase ""countries within a country"" to describe the United Kingdom.[22] Some statistical summaries, such as those for the twelve NUTS 1 regions of the United Kingdom refer to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland as ""regions"".[47][48] Northern Ireland is also referred to as a ""province"".[49][50] With regard to Northern Ireland, the descriptive name used ""can be controversial, with the choice often revealing one's political preferences"".[51] The term ""Great Britain"" conventionally refers to the island of Great Britain, or politically to England, Scotland and Wales in combination.[52][53][54] It is sometimes used as a loose synonym for the United Kingdom as a whole.[55] The term ""Britain"" is used both as a synonym for Great Britain,[56][57][58] and as a synonym for the United Kingdom.[59][58] Usage is mixed: the UK Government prefers to use the term ""UK"" rather than ""Britain"" or ""British"" on its own website (except when referring to embassies),[60] while acknowledging that both terms refer to the United Kingdom and that elsewhere '""British government"" is used at least as frequently as ""United Kingdom government"".[61] The UK Permanent Committee on Geographical Names recognises ""United Kingdom"", ""UK"" and ""U.K."" as shortened and abbreviated geopolitical terms for the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in its toponymic guidelines; it does not list ""Britain"" but notes 'it is only the one specific nominal term ""Great Britain"" which invariably excludes Northern Ireland.'[61] The BBC historically preferred to use ""Britain"" as shorthand only for Great Britain, though the present style guide does not take a position except that ""Great Britain"" excludes Northern Ireland.[62][63] The adjective ""British"" is commonly used to refer to matters relating to the United Kingdom and is used in law to refer to United Kingdom citizenship and matters to do with nationality.[64] People of the United Kingdom use a number of different terms to describe their national identity and may identify themselves as being British, English, Scottish, Welsh, Northern Irish, or Irish;[65] or as having a combination of different national identities.[66][67] The official designation for a citizen of the United Kingdom is ""British citizen"".[61] History Prior to the Treaty of Union Main articles: History of England, History of Wales, History of Scotland, History of Ireland, and History of the formation of the United Kingdom See also: History of the British Isles Stonehenge consists of a ring of standing stones, each around 4 m (13 ft) high and 2 m (7 ft) wide and weighing approximately 25 tonnes; erected between 2400 BC and 2200 BC Settlement by anatomically modern humans of what was to become the United Kingdom occurred in waves beginning by about 30,000 years ago.[68] By the end of the region's prehistoric period, the population is thought to have belonged, in the main, to a culture termed Insular Celtic, comprising Brittonic Britain and Gaelic Ireland.[69] Prior to the Roman conquest, Britain was home to about 30 indigenous tribes. The largest were the Belgae, the Brigantes, the Silures and the Iceni. Historian Edward Gibbon believed that Spain, Gaul and Britain were populated by ""the same hardy race of savages"", based on the similarity of their ""manners and languages.""[70] The Roman conquest, beginning in 43 AD, and the 400-year rule of southern Britain, was followed by an invasion by Germanic Anglo-Saxon settlers, reducing the Brittonic area mainly to what was to become Wales, Cornwall and, until the latter stages of the Anglo-Saxon settlement, the Hen Ogledd (northern England and parts of southern Scotland).[71] Most of the region settled by the Anglo-Saxons became unified as the Kingdom of England in the 10th century.[72] Meanwhile, Gaelic-speakers in north-west Britain (with connections to the north-east of Ireland and traditionally supposed to have migrated from there in the 5th century)[73][74] united with the Picts to create the Kingdom of Scotland in the 9th century.[75] The Bayeux Tapestry depicts the Battle of Hastings, 1066, and the events leading to it. In 1066, the Normans and their Breton allies invaded England from northern France. After conquering England, they seized large parts of Wales, conquered much of Ireland and were invited to settle in Scotland, bringing to each country feudalism on the Northern French model and Norman-French culture.[76] The Anglo-Norman ruling class greatly influenced, but eventually assimilated with, each of the local cultures.[77] Subsequent medieval English kings completed the conquest of Wales and made unsuccessful attempts to annex Scotland. Asserting its independence in the 1320 Declaration of Arbroath, Scotland maintained its independence thereafter, albeit in near-constant conflict with England. The English monarchs, through inheritance of substantial territories in France and claims to the French crown, were also heavily involved in conflicts in France, most notably the Hundred Years War, while the Kings of Scots were in an alliance with the French during this period.[78] Early modern Britain saw religious conflict resulting from the Reformation and the introduction of Protestant state churches in each country.[79] Wales was fully incorporated into the Kingdom of England,[80] and Ireland was constituted as a kingdom in personal union with the English crown.[81] In what was to become Northern Ireland, the lands of the independent Catholic Gaelic nobility were confiscated and given to Protestant settlers from England and Scotland.[82] In 1603, the kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland were united in a personal union when James VI, King of Scots, inherited the crowns of England and Ireland and moved his court from Edinburgh to London; each country nevertheless remained a separate political entity and retained its separate political, legal, and religious institutions.[83][84] In the mid-17th century, all three kingdoms were involved in a series of connected wars (including the English Civil War) which led to the temporary overthrow of the monarchy, with the execution of King Charles I, and the establishment of the short-lived unitary republic of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland.[85][86] During the 17th and 18th centuries, British sailors were involved in acts of piracy (privateering), attacking and stealing from ships off the coast of Europe and the Caribbean.[87] Although the monarchy was restored, the Interregnum (along with the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and the subsequent Bill of Rights 1689, and the Claim of Right Act 1689) ensured that, unlike much of the rest of Europe, royal absolutism would not prevail, and a professed Catholic could never accede to the throne. The British constitution would develop on the basis of constitutional monarchy and the parliamentary system.[88] With the founding of the Royal Society in 1660, science was greatly encouraged. During this period, particularly in England, the development of naval power and the interest in voyages of discovery led to the acquisition and settlement of overseas colonies, particularly in North America and the Caribbean.[89][90] Though previous attempts at uniting the two kingdoms within Great Britain in 1606, 1667, and 1689 had proved unsuccessful, the attempt initiated in 1705 led to the Treaty of Union of 1706 being agreed and ratified by both parliaments. Kingdom of Great Britain Main article: Kingdom of Great Britain The Treaty of Union led to a united kingdom encompassing all of Great Britain. On 1 May 1707, the Kingdom of Great Britain was formed, the result of Acts of Union being passed by the parliaments of England and Scotland to ratify the 1706 Treaty of Union and so unite the two kingdoms.[91][92][93] In the 18th century, cabinet government developed under Robert Walpole, in practice the first prime minister (1721–1742). A series of Jacobite Uprisings sought to remove the Protestant House of Hanover from the British throne and restore the Catholic House of Stuart. The Jacobites were finally defeated at the Battle of Culloden in 1746, after which the Scottish Highlanders were brutally suppressed. The British colonies in North America that broke away from Britain in the American War of Independence became the United States of America, recognised by Britain in 1783. British imperial ambition turned towards Asia, particularly to India.[94] Britain played a leading part in the Atlantic slave trade, mainly between 1662 and 1807 when British or British-colonial Slave ships transported nearly 3.3 million slaves from Africa.[95] The slaves were taken to work on plantations in British possessions, principally in the Caribbean but also North America.[96] Slavery coupled with the Caribbean sugar industry had a significant role in strengthening and developing the British economy in the 18th century.[97] However, Parliament banned the trade in 1807, banned slavery in the British Empire in 1833, and Britain took a leading role in the movement to abolish slavery worldwide through the blockade of Africa and pressing other nations to end their trade with a series of treaties. The world's oldest international human rights organisation, Anti-Slavery International, was formed in London in 1839.[98][99][100] From the union with Ireland to the end of the First World War Main article: History of the United Kingdom The Anglo-Dutch council of war before Bombardment of Algiers (1816), in which a British-Allied fleet freed 3,000 Christian slaves. The term ""United Kingdom"" became official in 1801 when the parliaments of Great Britain and Ireland each passed an Act of Union, uniting the two kingdoms and creating the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.[101] After the defeat of France at the end of the French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars (1792–1815), the United Kingdom emerged as the principal naval and imperial power of the 19th century (with London the largest city in the world from about 1830).[102] Unchallenged at sea, British dominance was later described as Pax Britannica (""British Peace""), a period of relative peace among the Great Powers (1815–1914) during which the British Empire became the global hegemon and adopted the role of global policeman.[103][104][105][106] By the time of the Great Exhibition of 1851, Britain was described as the ""workshop of the world"".[107] From 1853 to 1856, Britain took part in the Crimean War, allied with the Ottoman Empire in the fight against the Russian Empire,[108] participating in the naval battles of the Baltic Sea known as the Åland War in the Gulf of Bothnia and the Gulf of Finland, among others.[109] The British Empire was expanded to include India, large parts of Africa and many other territories throughout the world. Alongside the formal control it exerted over its own colonies, British dominance of much of world trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of many regions, such as Asia and Latin America.[110][111] Domestically, political attitudes favoured free trade and laissez-faire policies and a gradual widening of the voting franchise. During the century, the population increased at a dramatic rate, accompanied by rapid urbanisation, causing significant social and economic stresses.[112] To seek new markets and sources of raw materials, the Conservative Party under Disraeli launched a period of imperialist expansion in Egypt, South Africa, and elsewhere. Canada, Australia and New Zealand became self-governing dominions.[113] After the turn of the century, Britain's industrial dominance was challenged by Germany and the United States.[114] Social reform and home rule for Ireland were important domestic issues after 1900. The Labour Party emerged from an alliance of trade unions and small socialist groups in 1900, and suffragettes campaigned from before 1914 for women's right to vote.[115] Infantry of the Royal Irish Rifles during the Battle of the Somme. More than 885,000 British soldiers died on the battlefields of the First World War. Britain fought alongside France, Russia and (after 1917) the United States, against Germany and its allies in the First World War (1914–1918).[116] British armed forces were engaged across much of the British Empire and in several regions of Europe, particularly on the Western front.[117] The high fatalities of trench warfare caused the loss of much of a generation of men, with lasting social effects in the nation and a great disruption in the social order. After the war, Britain received the League of Nations mandate over a number of former German and Ottoman colonies. The British Empire reached its greatest extent, covering a fifth of the world's land surface and a quarter of its population.[118] Britain had suffered 2.5 million casualties and finished the war with a huge national debt.[117] Interwar years and the Second World War Main articles: Interwar Britain, Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II, and United Kingdom home front during World War II By the mid 1920s most of the British population could listen to BBC radio programmes.[119][120] Experimental television broadcasts began in 1929 and the first scheduled BBC Television Service commenced in 1936.[121] The rise of Irish nationalism, and disputes within Ireland over the terms of Irish Home Rule, led eventually to the partition of the island in 1921.[122] The Irish Free State became independent, initially with Dominion status in 1922, and unambiguously independent in 1931. Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom.[123] The 1928 Act widened suffrage by giving women electoral equality with men. A wave of strikes in the mid-1920s culminated in the General Strike of 1926. Britain had still not recovered from the effects of the war when the Great Depression (1929–1932) occurred. This led to considerable unemployment and hardship in the old industrial areas, as well as political and social unrest in the 1930s, with rising membership in communist and socialist parties. A coalition government was formed in 1931.[124] Nonetheless, ""Britain was a very wealthy country, formidable in arms, ruthless in pursuit of its interests and sitting at the heart of a global production system.""[125] After Nazi Germany invaded Poland, Britain entered the Second World War by declaring war on Germany in 1939. Winston Churchill became prime minister and head of a coalition government in 1940. Despite the defeat of its European allies in the first year of the war, Britain and its Empire continued the fight alone against Germany. Churchill engaged industry, scientists, and engineers to advise and support the government and the military in the prosecution of the war effort.[125] In 1940, the Royal Air Force defeated the German Luftwaffe in a struggle for control of the skies in the Battle of Britain. Urban areas suffered heavy bombing during the Blitz. The Grand Alliance of Britain, the United States and the Soviet Union formed in 1941 leading the Allies against the Axis powers. There were eventual hard-fought victories in the Battle of the Atlantic, the North Africa campaign and the Italian campaign. British forces played an important role in the Normandy landings of 1944 and the liberation of Europe, achieved with its allies the United States, the Soviet Union and other Allied countries. The British Army led the Burma campaign against Japan and the British Pacific Fleet fought Japan at sea. British scientists contributed to the Manhattan Project which led to the surrender of Japan. Postwar 20th century Main articles: Postwar Britain (1945–1979) and Social history of Postwar Britain (1945–1979) Map showing territories that were at one time part of the British Empire, with the United Kingdom and its current British Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies underlined in red During the Second World War, the UK was one of the Big Three powers (along with the U.S. and the Soviet Union) who met to plan the post-war world;[126][127] it was an original signatory to the Declaration by United Nations. After the war, the UK became one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and worked closely with the United States to establish the IMF, World Bank and NATO.[128][129] The war left the UK severely weakened and financially dependent on the Marshall Plan,[130] but it was spared the total war that devastated eastern Europe.[131] In the immediate post-war years, the Labour government initiated a radical programme of reforms, which had a significant effect on British society in the following decades.[132] Major industries and public utilities were nationalised, a welfare state was established, and a comprehensive, publicly funded healthcare system, the National Health Service, was created.[133] The rise of nationalism in the colonies coincided with Britain's now much-diminished economic position, so that a policy of decolonisation was unavoidable. Independence was granted to India and Pakistan in 1947.[134] Over the next three decades, most colonies of the British Empire gained their independence, with all those that sought independence supported by the UK, during both the transition period and afterwards. Many became members of the Commonwealth of Nations.[135] The UK was the third country to develop a nuclear weapons arsenal (with its first atomic bomb test, Operation Hurricane, in 1952), but the new post-war limits of Britain's international role were illustrated by the Suez Crisis of 1956. The international spread of the English language ensured the continuing international influence of its literature and culture.[136][137] As a result of a shortage of workers in the 1950s, the government encouraged immigration from Commonwealth countries. In the following decades, the UK became a more multi-ethnic society than before.[138] Despite rising living standards in the late 1950s and 1960s, the UK's economic performance was less successful than many of its main competitors such as France, West Germany and Japan. Leaders of member states of the European Union in 2007. The UK entered the European Economic Community in 1973. In a referendum held in 1975, 67 per cent of voters voted to remain in the EEC,[139] but 52 per cent voted to leave the EU in 2016.[140] In the decades-long process of European integration, the UK was a founding member of the alliance called the Western European Union, established with the London and Paris Conferences in 1954. In 1960 the UK was one of the seven founding members of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), but in 1973 it left to join the European Communities (EC). When the EC became the European Union (EU) in 1992, the UK was one of the 12 founding member states. The Treaty of Lisbon, signed in 2007, forms the constitutional basis of the European Union since then. From the late 1960s, Northern Ireland suffered communal and paramilitary violence (sometimes affecting other parts of the UK) conventionally known as the Troubles. It is usually considered to have ended with the Belfast ""Good Friday"" Agreement of 1998.[141][142][143] Following a period of widespread economic slowdown and industrial strife in the 1970s, the Conservative government of the 1980s under Margaret Thatcher initiated a radical policy of monetarism, deregulation, particularly of the financial sector (for example, the Big Bang in 1986) and labour markets, the sale of state-owned companies (privatisation), and the withdrawal of subsidies to others.[144] From 1984, the economy was helped by the inflow of substantial North Sea oil revenues.[145] Around the end of the 20th century, there were major changes to the governance of the UK with the establishment of devolved administrations for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.[146] The statutory incorporation followed acceptance of the European Convention on Human Rights. The UK is still a key global player diplomatically and militarily. It plays leading roles in the UN and NATO. Controversy surrounds some of Britain's overseas military deployments, particularly in Afghanistan and Iraq.[147] 21st century Main articles: Political history of the United Kingdom (1979–present) and Social history of the United Kingdom (1979–present) In the first decade the UK supported the United States-led invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. The 2008 global financial crisis severely affected the UK economy. The Cameron–Clegg coalition government of 2010 introduced austerity measures intended to tackle the substantial public deficits which resulted.[148] In 2014 the Scottish Government held a referendum on Scottish independence, with 55.3 per cent of voters rejecting the independence proposal and opting to remain within the United Kingdom.[149] In 2016, 51.9 per cent of voters in the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union.[150] The UK remained a full member of the EU until 31 January 2020.[151] Geography Main article: Geography of the United Kingdom The United Kingdom showing hilly regions to north and west The total area of the United Kingdom is approximately 244,820 square kilometres (94,530 sq mi). The country occupies the major part of the British Isles[152] archipelago and includes the island of Great Britain, the north-eastern one-sixth of the island of Ireland and some smaller surrounding islands. It lies between the North Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea with the southeast coast coming within 22 miles (35 km) of the coast of northern France, from which it is separated by the English Channel.[153] In 1993 10 per cent of the UK was forested, 46 per cent used for pastures and 25 per cent cultivated for agriculture.[154] The Royal Greenwich Observatory in London was chosen as the defining point of the Prime Meridian[155] in Washington, DC, in 1884, although due to more accurate modern measurement the meridian actually lies 100 metres to the east of the observatory.[156] The United Kingdom lies between latitudes 49° and 61° N, and longitudes 9° W and 2° E. Northern Ireland shares a 224-mile (360 km) land boundary with the Republic of Ireland.[153] The coastline of Great Britain is 11,073 miles (17,820 km) long.[157] It is connected to continental Europe by the Channel Tunnel, which at 31 miles (50 km) (24 miles (38 km) underwater) is the longest underwater tunnel in the world.[158] England accounts for just over half (53 per cent) of the total area of the UK, covering 130,395 square kilometres (50,350 sq mi).[159] Most of the country consists of lowland terrain,[154] with more upland and some mountainous terrain northwest of the Tees-Exe line; including the Lake District, the Pennines, Exmoor and Dartmoor. The main rivers and estuaries are the Thames, Severn and the Humber. England's highest mountain is Scafell Pike (978 metres (3,209 ft)) in the Lake District. The Skiddaw massif, town of Keswick and Derwent Water in LakelandSkye is one of the major islands in the Inner Hebrides and part of the Scottish Highlands. Scotland accounts for just under one-third (32 per cent) of the total area of the UK, covering 78,772 square kilometres (30,410 sq mi).[160] This includes nearly 800 islands,[161] predominantly west and north of the mainland; notably the Hebrides, Orkney Islands and Shetland Islands. Scotland is the most mountainous country in the UK and its topography is distinguished by the Highland Boundary Fault – a geological rock fracture – which traverses Scotland from Arran in the west to Stonehaven in the east.[162] The fault separates two distinctively different regions; namely the Highlands to the north and west and the Lowlands to the south and east. The more rugged Highland region contains the majority of Scotland's mountainous land, including Ben Nevis which at 1,345 metres (4,413 ft)[163] is the highest point in the British Isles.[164] Lowland areas – especially the narrow waist of land between the Firth of Clyde and the Firth of Forth known as the Central Belt – are flatter and home to most of the population including Glasgow, Scotland's largest city, and Edinburgh, its capital and political centre, although upland and mountainous terrain lies within the Southern Uplands. Wales accounts for less than one-tenth (9 per cent) of the total area of the UK, covering 20,779 square kilometres (8,020 sq mi).[165] Wales is mostly mountainous, though South Wales is less mountainous than North and mid Wales. The main population and industrial areas are in South Wales, consisting of the coastal cities of Cardiff, Swansea and Newport, and the South Wales Valleys to their north. The highest mountains in Wales are in Snowdonia and include Snowdon (Welsh: Yr Wyddfa) which, at 1,085 metres (3,560 ft), is the highest peak in Wales.[154] Wales has over 2,704 kilometres (1,680 miles) of coastline.[157] Several islands lie off the Welsh mainland, the largest of which is Anglesey (Ynys Môn) in the north-west. Northern Ireland, separated from Great Britain by the Irish Sea and North Channel, has an area of 14,160 square kilometres (5,470 sq mi) and is mostly hilly. It includes Lough Neagh which, at 388 square kilometres (150 sq mi), is the largest lake in the British Isles by area.[166] The highest peak in Northern Ireland is Slieve Donard in the Mourne Mountains at 852 metres (2,795 ft).[154] The UK contains four terrestrial ecoregions: Celtic broadleaf forests, English Lowlands beech forests, North Atlantic moist mixed forests, and Caledon conifer forests.[167] The country had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 1.65/10, ranking it 161th globally out of 172 countries.[168] Climate Main article: Climate of the United Kingdom Köppen climate types of the UK Most of the United Kingdom has a temperate climate, with generally cool temperatures and plentiful rainfall all year round.[153] The temperature varies with the seasons seldom dropping below −20 °C (−4 °F) or rising above 35 °C (95 °F).[169][170] Some parts, away from the coast, of upland England, Wales, Northern Ireland and most of Scotland, experience a subpolar oceanic climate (Cfc). Higher elevations in Scotland experience a continental subarctic climate (Dfc) and the mountains experience a tundra climate (ET).[171] The prevailing wind is from the southwest and bears frequent spells of mild and wet weather from the Atlantic Ocean,[153] although the eastern parts are mostly sheltered from this wind since the majority of the rain falls over the western regions the eastern parts are therefore the driest. Atlantic currents, warmed by the Gulf Stream, bring mild winters;[172] especially in the west where winters are wet and even more so over high ground. Summers are warmest in the southeast of England and coolest in the north. Heavy snowfall can occur in winter and early spring on high ground, and occasionally settles to great depth away from the hills. United Kingdom is ranked 4 out of 180 countries in the Environmental Performance Index.[173] A law has been passed that UK greenhouse gas emissions will be net zero by 2050.[174] Politics Main article: Politics of the United Kingdom Elizabeth II, monarch since 1952Boris Johnson, prime minister since 2019 The United Kingdom is a unitary state under a constitutional monarchy. Queen Elizabeth II is the monarch and head of state of the UK, as well as 15 other independent countries. These 16 countries are sometimes referred to as ""Commonwealth realms"". The monarch has ""the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, and the right to warn"".[175] The Constitution of the United Kingdom is uncodified and consists mostly of a collection of disparate written sources, including statutes, judge-made case law and international treaties, together with constitutional conventions.[176] As there is no technical difference between ordinary statutes and ""constitutional law"",[citation needed] the UK Parliament can perform ""constitutional reform"" simply by passing Acts of Parliament, and thus has the political power to change or abolish almost any written or unwritten element of the constitution. No Parliament can pass laws that future Parliaments cannot change.[177] Government Main article: Government of the United Kingdom The Palace of Westminster, seat of both houses of the Parliament of the United Kingdom Organisational chart of the UK political system The UK is a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy.[178] The Parliament of the United Kingdom is sovereign.[179] It is made up of the House of Commons, the House of Lords and the Crown.[180] The main business of Parliament takes place in the two houses,[180] but royal assent is required for a bill to become an Act of Parliament (law).[181] For general elections (elections to the House of Commons), the UK is divided into 650 constituencies, each of which is represented by a member of Parliament (MP).[182] MPs hold office for up to five years and are always up for relection in general elections.[182] The Conservative Party, Labour Party and Scottish National Party are, respectively, the current first, second and third largest parties (by number of MPs) in the House of Commons.[183] The prime minister is the head of government in the United Kingdom.[184] Nearly all prime ministers have served as First Lord of the Treasury[185] and all prime ministers have continuously served as First Lord of the Treasury since 1905,[186] Minister for the Civil Service since 1968[187] and Minister for the Union since 2019.[188][189] In modern times, the prime minister is, by constitutional convention, an MP.[190] The prime minister is appointed by the monarch[191] and their appointment is governed by constitutional conventions.[182] However, they are normally the leader of the political party with the most seats in the House of Commons[192] and hold office by virtue of their ability to command the confidence of the House of Commons.[190] The prime minister not only has statutory functions (alongside other ministers),[193] but is the monarch's principal adviser[194] and it is for them to advise the monarch on the exercise of the royal prerogative in relation to government.[190] In particular, the prime minister recommends the appointment of ministers[190] and chairs the Cabinet.[195] Administrative divisions Main article: Administrative geography of the United Kingdom England Scotland Wales NorthernIreland The four countries of the United Kingdom The geographical division of the United Kingdom into counties or shires began in England and Scotland in the early Middle Ages and was complete throughout Great Britain and Ireland by the early Modern Period.[196] Administrative arrangements were developed separately in each country of the United Kingdom, with origins which often predated the formation of the United Kingdom. Modern local government by elected councils, partly based on the ancient counties, was introduced separately: in England and Wales in a 1888 act, Scotland in a 1889 act and Ireland in a 1898 act, meaning there is no consistent system of administrative or geographic demarcation across the United Kingdom.[197] Until the 19th century there was little change to those arrangements, but there has since been a constant evolution of role and function.[198] The organisation of local government in England is complex, with the distribution of functions varying according to local arrangements. The upper-tier subdivisions of England are the nine regions, now used primarily for statistical purposes.[199] One region, Greater London, has had a directly elected assembly and mayor since 2000 following popular support for the proposal in a referendum.[200] It was intended that other regions would also be given their own elected regional assemblies, but a proposed assembly in the North East region was rejected by a referendum in 2004.[201] Since 2011, ten combined authorities have been established in England. Eight of these have elected mayors, the first elections for which took place on 4 May 2017.[202] Below the regional tier, some parts of England have county councils and district councils and others have unitary authorities, while London consists of 32 London boroughs and the City of London. Councillors are elected by the first-past-the-post system in single-member wards or by the multi-member plurality system in multi-member wards.[203] For local government purposes, Scotland is divided into 32 council areas, with wide variation in both size and population. The cities of Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee are separate council areas, as is the Highland Council, which includes a third of Scotland's area but only just over 200,000 people. Local councils are made up of elected councillors, of whom there are 1,223;[204] they are paid a part-time salary. Elections are conducted by single transferable vote in multi-member wards that elect either three or four councillors. Each council elects a Provost, or Convenor, to chair meetings of the council and to act as a figurehead for the area. Local government in Wales consists of 22 unitary authorities. All unitary authorities are led by a leader and cabinet elected by the council itself. These include the cities of Cardiff, Swansea and Newport, which are unitary authorities in their own right.[205] Elections are held every four years under the first-past-the-post system.[205] Local government in Northern Ireland has since 1973 been organised into 26 district councils, each elected by single transferable vote. Their powers are limited to services such as collecting waste, controlling dogs and maintaining parks and cemeteries.[206] In 2008 the executive agreed on proposals to create 11 new councils and replace the present system.[207] Devolved governments Main articles: Devolution in the United Kingdom, List of leaders of devolved administrations, Northern Ireland Executive, Scottish Government, and Welsh Government The Scottish Parliament Building in Holyrood is the seat of the Scottish Parliament. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland each have their own government or executive, led by a first minister (or, in the case of Northern Ireland, a diarchal first minister and deputy first minister), and a devolved unicameral legislature. England, the largest country of the United Kingdom, has no devolved executive or legislature and is administered and legislated for directly by the UK's government and parliament on all issues. This situation has given rise to the so-called West Lothian question, which concerns the fact that members of parliament from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland can vote, sometimes decisively,[208] on matters that affect only England.[209] The 2013 McKay Commission on this recommended that laws affecting only England should need support from a majority of English members of parliament.[210] The Scottish Government and Parliament have wide-ranging powers over any matter that has not been specifically reserved to the UK Parliament, including education, healthcare, Scots law and local government.[211] In 2012, the UK and Scottish governments signed the Edinburgh Agreement setting out the terms for a referendum on Scottish independence in 2014, which was defeated 55.3 per cent to 44.7 per cent – resulting in Scotland remaining a devolved part of the United Kingdom.[212] The British-Irish Council comprises the UK Government, the Irish Government and the governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland The Welsh Government and the Senedd (Welsh Parliament; formerly the National Assembly for Wales)[213] have more limited powers than those devolved to Scotland.[214] The Senedd is able to legislate on any matter not specifically reserved to the UK Parliament through Acts of Senedd Cymru. The Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly have powers similar to those devolved to Scotland. The Executive is led by a diarchy representing unionist and nationalist members of the Assembly.[215] Devolution to Northern Ireland is contingent on participation by the Northern Ireland administration in the North-South Ministerial Council, where the Northern Ireland Executive cooperates and develops joint and shared policies with the Government of Ireland. The British and Irish governments co-operate on non-devolved matters affecting Northern Ireland through the British–Irish Intergovernmental Conference, which assumes the responsibilities of the Northern Ireland administration in the event of its non-operation.[citation needed] The UK does not have a codified constitution and constitutional matters are not among the powers devolved to Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. Under the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty, the UK Parliament could, in theory, therefore, abolish the Scottish Parliament, Senedd or Northern Ireland Assembly.[216][217] Indeed, in 1972, the UK Parliament unilaterally prorogued the Parliament of Northern Ireland, setting a precedent relevant to contemporary devolved institutions.[218] In practice, it would be politically difficult for the UK Parliament to abolish devolution to the Scottish Parliament and the Senedd, given the political entrenchment created by referendum decisions.[219] The political constraints placed upon the UK Parliament's power to interfere with devolution in Northern Ireland are even greater than in relation to Scotland and Wales, given that devolution in Northern Ireland rests upon an international agreement with the Government of Ireland.[220] Dependencies Main articles: British Overseas Territories, Crown dependencies, British Islands, and List of leaders of British dependencies British Antarctic Territory: Rothera research station The United Kingdom has sovereignty over 17 territories which do not form part of the United Kingdom itself: 14 British Overseas Territories[27] and three Crown dependencies.[27][223] The 14 British Overseas Territories are remnants of the British Empire: they are Anguilla; Bermuda; the British Antarctic Territory; the British Indian Ocean Territory; the British Virgin Islands; the Cayman Islands; the Falkland Islands; Gibraltar; Montserrat; Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha; the Turks and Caicos Islands; the Pitcairn Islands; South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands; and Akrotiri and Dhekelia on the island of Cyprus.[224] British claims in Antarctica have limited international recognition.[225] Collectively Britain's overseas territories encompass an approximate land area of 480,000 square nautical miles (640,000 sq mi; 1,600,000 km2),[226] with a total population of approximately 250,000.[227] The overseas territories also give the UK the world's fifth largest exclusive economic zone at 6,805,586 km2 (2,627,651 sq mi).[228][better source needed] A 1999 UK government white paper stated that: ""[The] Overseas Territories are British for as long as they wish to remain British. Britain has willingly granted independence where it has been requested; and we will continue to do so where this is an option.""[229] Self-determination is also enshrined in the constitutions of several overseas territories and three have specifically voted to remain under British sovereignty (Bermuda in 1995,[230] Gibraltar in 2002[231] and the Falkland Islands in 2013).[232] The Crown dependencies are possessions of the Crown, as opposed to overseas territories of the UK.[233] They comprise three independently administered jurisdictions: the Channel Islands of Jersey and Guernsey in the English Channel, and the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea. By mutual agreement, the British Government manages the islands' foreign affairs and defence and the UK Parliament has the authority to legislate on their behalf. Internationally, they are regarded as ""territories for which the United Kingdom is responsible"".[234] The power to pass legislation affecting the islands ultimately rests with their own respective legislative assemblies, with the assent of the Crown (Privy Council or, in the case of the Isle of Man, in certain circumstances the Lieutenant-Governor).[235] Since 2005 each Crown dependency has had a Chief Minister as its head of government.[236] Locations of UK dependencies (crown dependencies alphabetised, overseas territories numbered): A Isle of Man; B Guernsey; C Jersey; 1 United Kingdom; 2 Gibraltar; 3 Akrotiri and Dhekelia; 4 Bermuda; 5 Turks and Caicos Islands; 6 British Virgin Islands; 7 Anguilla; 8 Cayman Islands; 9 Montserrat; 10 Pitcairn Islands; 11 Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha; 12 British Indian Ocean Territory; 13 Falkland Islands; 14 South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands; (15) British Antarctic Territory Law and criminal justice Main article: Law of the United Kingdom The Royal Courts of Justice of England and Wales The United Kingdom does not have a single legal system as Article 19 of the 1706 Treaty of Union provided for the continuation of Scotland's separate legal system.[237] Today the UK has three distinct systems of law: English law, Northern Ireland law and Scots law. A new Supreme Court of the United Kingdom came into being in October 2009 to replace the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords.[238][239] The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, including the same members as the Supreme Court, is the highest court of appeal for several independent Commonwealth countries, the British Overseas Territories and the Crown Dependencies.[240] The High Court of Justiciary – the supreme criminal court of Scotland Both English law, which applies in England and Wales, and Northern Ireland law are based on common-law principles.[241] The essence of common law is that, subject to statute, the law is developed by judges in courts, applying statute, precedent and common sense to the facts before them to give explanatory judgements of the relevant legal principles, which are reported and binding in future similar cases (stare decisis).[242] The courts of England and Wales are headed by the Senior Courts of England and Wales, consisting of the Court of Appeal, the High Court of Justice (for civil cases) and the Crown Court (for criminal cases). The Supreme Court is the highest court in the land for both criminal and civil appeal cases in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and any decision it makes is binding on every other court in the same jurisdiction, often having a persuasive effect in other jurisdictions.[243] Scots law is a hybrid system based on both common-law and civil-law principles. The chief courts are the Court of Session, for civil cases,[244] and the High Court of Justiciary, for criminal cases.[245] The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom serves as the highest court of appeal for civil cases under Scots law.[246] Sheriff courts deal with most civil and criminal cases including conducting criminal trials with a jury, known as sheriff solemn court, or with a sheriff and no jury, known as sheriff summary Court.[247] The Scots legal system is unique in having three possible verdicts for a criminal trial: ""guilty"", ""not guilty"" and ""not proven"". Both ""not guilty"" and ""not proven"" result in an acquittal.[248] Crime in England and Wales increased in the period between 1981 and 1995, though since that peak there has been an overall fall of 66 per cent in recorded crime from 1995 to 2015,[249] according to crime statistics. The prison population of England and Wales has increased to 86,000, giving England and Wales the highest rate of incarceration in Western Europe at 148 per 100,000.[250][251] Her Majesty's Prison Service, which reports to the Ministry of Justice, manages most of the prisons within England and Wales. The murder rate in England and Wales has stabilised in the first half of the 2010s with a murder rate around 1 per 100,000 which is half the peak in 2002 and similar to the rate in the 1980s[252] Crime in Scotland fell slightly in 2014/2015 to its lowest level in 39 years in with 59 killings for a murder rate of 1.1 per 100,000. Scotland's prisons are overcrowded but the prison population is shrinking.[253] Foreign relations Main article: Foreign relations of the United Kingdom The UK is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, a member of NATO, the Commonwealth of Nations, the G7 finance ministers, the G7 forum, the G20, the OECD, the WTO, the Council of Europe and the OSCE.[254] The UK is said to have a ""Special Relationship"" with the United States and a close partnership with France – the ""Entente cordiale"" – and shares nuclear weapons technology with both countries;[255][256] the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance is considered to be the oldest binding military alliance in the world. The UK is also closely linked with the Republic of Ireland; the two countries share a Common Travel Area and co-operate through the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference and the British-Irish Council. Britain's global presence and influence is further amplified through its trading relations, foreign investments, official development assistance and military engagements.[257] Canada, Australia and New Zealand, all of which are former colonies of the British Empire, are the most favourably viewed countries in the world by British people.[258][259] Military Main article: British Armed Forces HMS Queen Elizabeth, a Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carrier underway in the Atlantic Ocean, October 2019 Her Majesty's Armed Forces consist of three professional service branches: the Royal Navy and Royal Marines (forming the Naval Service), the British Army and the Royal Air Force.[260] The armed forces of the United Kingdom are managed by the Ministry of Defence and controlled by the Defence Council, chaired by the Secretary of State for Defence. The Commander-in-Chief is the British monarch, to whom members of the forces swear an oath of allegiance.[261] The Armed Forces are charged with protecting the UK and its overseas territories, promoting the UK's global security interests and supporting international peacekeeping efforts. They are active and regular participants in NATO, including the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps, as well as the Five Power Defence Arrangements, RIMPAC and other worldwide coalition operations. Overseas garrisons and facilities are maintained in Ascension Island, Bahrain, Belize, Brunei, Canada, Cyprus, Diego Garcia, the Falkland Islands, Germany, Gibraltar, Kenya, Oman, Qatar and Singapore.[262][263] The British armed forces played a key role in establishing the British Empire as the dominant world power in the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries. By emerging victorious from conflicts, Britain has often been able to decisively influence world events. Since the end of the British Empire, the UK has remained a major military power. Following the end of the Cold War, defence policy has a stated assumption that ""the most demanding operations"" will be undertaken as part of a coalition.[264] According to sources which include the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute and the International Institute for Strategic Studies, the UK has either the fourth- or the fifth-highest military expenditure. Total defence spending amounts to 2.0 per cent of national GDP.[265] Economy Main article: Economy of the United Kingdom Overview The Bank of England – the central bank of the United Kingdom and the model on which most modern central banks have been based The UK has a partially regulated market economy.[266] Based on market exchange rates, the UK is today the fifth-largest economy in the world and the second-largest in Europe after Germany. HM Treasury, led by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, is responsible for developing and executing the government's public finance policy and economic policy. The Bank of England is the UK's central bank and is responsible for issuing notes and coins in the nation's currency, the pound sterling. Banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland retain the right to issue their own notes, subject to retaining enough Bank of England notes in reserve to cover their issue. The pound sterling is the world's third-largest reserve currency (after the US dollar and the euro).[267] Since 1997 the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee, headed by the Governor of the Bank of England, has been responsible for setting interest rates at the level necessary to achieve the overall inflation target for the economy that is set by the Chancellor each year.[268] The UK service sector makes up around 79 per cent of GDP.[269] London is one of the world's largest financial centres, ranking 2nd in the world, behind New York City, in the Global Financial Centres Index in 2020.[270] London also has the largest city GDP in Europe.[271] Edinburgh ranks 17th in the world, and 6th in Western Europe in the Global Financial Centres Index in 2020.[270] Tourism is very important to the British economy; with over 27 million tourists arriving in 2004, the United Kingdom is ranked as the sixth major tourist destination in the world and London has the most international visitors of any city in the world.[272][273] The creative industries accounted for 7 per cent GVA in 2005 and grew at an average of 6 per cent per annum between 1997 and 2005.[274] Following the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, the functioning of the UK internal economic market is enshrined by the United Kingdom Internal Market Act 2020 which ensures trade in goods and services continues without internal barriers across the four countries of the United Kingdom.[275][276] The Industrial Revolution started in the UK with an initial concentration on the textile industry,[277] followed by other heavy industries such as shipbuilding, coal mining and steelmaking.[278][279] British merchants, shippers and bankers developed overwhelming advantage over those of other nations allowing the UK to dominate international trade in the 19th century.[280][281] As other nations industrialised, coupled with economic decline after two world wars, the United Kingdom began to lose its competitive advantage and heavy industry declined, by degrees, throughout the 20th century. Manufacturing remains a significant part of the economy but accounted for only 16.7 per cent of national output in 2003.[282] Jaguar XEJaguar cars are designed, developed and manufactured in the UK The automotive industry employs around 800,000 people, with a turnover in 2015 of £70 billion, generating £34.6 billion of exports (11.8 per cent of the UK's total export goods). In 2015, the UK produced around 1.6 million passenger vehicles and 94,500 commercial vehicles. The UK is a major centre for engine manufacturing: in 2015 around 2.4 million engines were produced. The UK motorsport industry employs around 41,000 people, comprises around 4,500 companies and has an annual turnover of around £6 billion.[283] The aerospace industry of the UK is the second- or third-largest national aerospace industry in the world depending upon the method of measurement and has an annual turnover of around £30 billion.[284] Engines and wings for the Airbus A380 are manufactured in the UK. BAE Systems plays a critical role in some of the world's biggest defence aerospace projects. In the UK, the company makes large sections of the Typhoon Eurofighter and assembles the aircraft for the Royal Air Force. It is also a principal subcontractor on the F35 Joint Strike Fighter – the world's largest single defence project – for which it designs and manufactures a range of components. It also manufactures the Hawk, the world's most successful jet training aircraft.[285] Airbus UK also manufactures the wings for the A400 m military transporter. Rolls-Royce is the world's second-largest aero-engine manufacturer. Its engines power more than 30 types of commercial aircraft and it has more than 30,000 engines in service in the civil and defence sectors. The UK space industry was worth £9.1bn in 2011 and employed 29,000 people. It is growing at a rate of 7.5 per cent annually, according to its umbrella organisation, the UK Space Agency. In 2013, the British Government pledged £60 m to the Skylon project: this investment will provide support at a ""crucial stage"" to allow a full-scale prototype of the SABRE engine to be built. The pharmaceutical industry plays an important role in the UK economy and the country has the third-highest share of global pharmaceutical R&D expenditures.[286][287] Agriculture is intensive, highly mechanised and efficient by European standards, producing about 60 per cent of food needs with less than 1.6 per cent of the labour force (535,000 workers).[288] Around two-thirds of production is devoted to livestock, one-third to arable crops. The UK retains a significant, though much reduced fishing industry. It is also rich in a number of natural resources including coal, petroleum, natural gas, tin, limestone, iron ore, salt, clay, chalk, gypsum, lead, silica and an abundance of arable land.[289] The City of London is one of two main financial centres[290][291][292]Canary Wharf is one of two main financial centres of the United Kingdom In the final quarter of 2008, the UK economy officially entered recession for the first time since 1991.[293] Following the likes of the United States, France and many major economies, in 2013, the UK lost its top AAA credit rating for the first time since 1978 with Moodys and Fitch credit agency, but, unlike the other major economies, retained its triple A rating with Standard & Poor's.[294][295] By the end of 2014, UK growth was the fastest in both the G7 and in Europe,[296][297] and by September 2015, the unemployment rate was down to a seven-year low of 5.3 per cent.[298] In 2020, coronavirus lockdown measures caused the UK economy to suffer its biggest slump on record, shrinking by 20.4 per cent between April and June compared to the first three months of the year, to push it officially into recession for the first time in 11 years.[299] The UK has an external debt of $9.6 trillion dollars, which is the second-highest in the world after the US. As a percentage of GDP, external debt is 408 per cent, which is the third-highest in the world after Luxembourg and Iceland.[300][301][302][303][304] Science and technology Main article: Science and technology in the United Kingdom Charles Darwin (1809–1882), whose theory of evolution by natural selection is the foundation of modern biological sciences England and Scotland were leading centres of the Scientific Revolution from the 17th century.[305] The United Kingdom led the Industrial Revolution from the 18th century,[277] and has continued to produce scientists and engineers credited with important advances.[306] Major theorists from the 17th and 18th centuries include Isaac Newton, whose laws of motion and illumination of gravity have been seen as a keystone of modern science;[307] from the 19th century Charles Darwin, whose theory of evolution by natural selection was fundamental to the development of modern biology, and James Clerk Maxwell, who formulated classical electromagnetic theory; and more recently Stephen Hawking, who advanced major theories in the fields of cosmology, quantum gravity and the investigation of black holes.[308] Major scientific discoveries from the 18th century include hydrogen by Henry Cavendish;[309] from the 20th century penicillin by Alexander Fleming,[310] and the structure of DNA, by Francis Crick and others.[311] Famous British engineers and inventors of the Industrial Revolution include James Watt, George Stephenson, Richard Arkwright, Robert Stephenson and Isambard Kingdom Brunel.[312] Other major engineering projects and applications by people from the UK include the steam locomotive, developed by Richard Trevithick and Andrew Vivian;[313] from the 19th century the electric motor by Michael Faraday, the first computer designed by Charles Babbage,[314] the first commercial electrical telegraph by William Fothergill Cooke and Charles Wheatstone,[315] the incandescent light bulb by Joseph Swan,[316] and the first practical telephone, patented by Alexander Graham Bell;[317] and in the 20th century the world's first working television system by John Logie Baird and others,[318] the jet engine by Frank Whittle, the basis of the modern computer by Alan Turing, and the World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee.[319] Scientific research and development remains important in British universities, with many establishing science parks to facilitate production and co-operation with industry.[320] Between 2004 and 2008 the UK produced 7 per cent of the world's scientific research papers and had an 8 per cent share of scientific citations, the third and second-highest in the world (after the United States and China, respectively).[321] Scientific journals produced in the UK include Nature, the British Medical Journal and The Lancet.[322] Transport Main article: Transport in the United Kingdom London St Pancras International is the UK's 13th busiest railway terminus. The station is one of London's main domestic and international transport hubs providing both commuter rail and high-speed rail services across the UK and to Paris, Lille and Brussels. A radial road network totals 29,145 miles (46,904 km) of main roads, 2,173 miles (3,497 km) of motorways and 213,750 miles (344,000 km) of paved roads.[153] The M25, encircling London, is the largest and busiest bypass in the world.[323] In 2009 there were a total of 34 million licensed vehicles in Great Britain.[324] The rail network in the UK is the oldest such network in the world. The system consists of five high-speed main lines (the West Coast, East Coast, Midland, Great Western and Great Eastern), which radiate from London to the rest of the country, augmented by regional rail lines and dense commuter networks within the major cities. High Speed 1 is operationally separate from the rest of the network. The world's first passenger railway running on steam was the Stockton and Darlington Railway, opened on 27 September 1825. Just under five years later the world's first intercity railway was the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, designed by George Stephenson and opened by the Prime Minister, the Duke of Wellington on 15 September 1830. The network grew rapidly as a patchwork of literally hundreds of separate companies during the Victorian era.[325][326][327][328][329][330] The UK has a railway network of 10,072 miles (16,209 km) in Great Britain and 189 miles (304 km) in Northern Ireland. Railways in Northern Ireland are operated by NI Railways, a subsidiary of state-owned Translink. In Great Britain, the British Rail network was privatised between 1994 and 1997, which was followed by a rapid rise in passenger numbers. The UK was ranked eighth among national European rail systems in the 2017 European Railway Performance Index assessing intensity of use, quality of service and safety.[331] Network Rail owns and manages most of the fixed assets (tracks, signals etc.). HS2, a new high-speed railway line, is estimated to cost £56 billion.[332] Crossrail, under construction in London, is Europe's largest construction project with a £15 billion projected cost.[333][334] In the year from October 2009 to September 2010 UK airports handled a total of 211.4 million passengers.[335] In that period the three largest airports were London Heathrow Airport (65.6 million passengers), Gatwick Airport (31.5 million passengers) and London Stansted Airport (18.9 million passengers).[335] London Heathrow Airport, located 15 miles (24 km) west of the capital, has the most international passenger traffic of any airport in the world[336][337] and is the hub for the UK flag carrier British Airways, as well as Virgin Atlantic.[338] Energy Main article: Energy in the United Kingdom Wind turbines overlooking Ardrossan, Scotland. The UK is one of the best sites in Europe for wind energy, and wind power production is its fastest growing supply. In 2006, the UK was the world's ninth-largest consumer of energy and the 15th-largest producer.[339] The UK is home to a number of large energy companies, including two of the six oil and gas ""supermajors"" – BP and Royal Dutch Shell.[340][341] In 2013, the UK produced 914 thousand barrels per day (bbl/d) of oil and consumed 1,507 thousand bbl/d.[342][343] Production is now in decline and the UK has been a net importer of oil since 2005.[344] In 2010[update] the UK had around 3.1 billion barrels of proven crude oil reserves, the largest of any EU member state.[344] In 2009, the UK was the 13th-largest producer of natural gas in the world and the largest producer in the EU.[345] Production is now in decline and the UK has been a net importer of natural gas since 2004.[345] Coal production played a key role in the UK economy in the 19th and 20th centuries. In the mid-1970s, 130 million tonnes of coal were produced annually, not falling below 100 million tonnes until the early 1980s. During the 1980s and 1990s the industry was scaled back considerably. In 2011, the UK produced 18.3 million tonnes of coal.[346] In 2005 it had proven recoverable coal reserves of 171 million tons.[346] The UK Coal Authority has stated there is a potential to produce between 7 billion tonnes and 16 billion tonnes of coal through underground coal gasification (UCG) or 'fracking',[347] and that, based on current UK coal consumption, such reserves could last between 200 and 400 years.[348] Environmental and social concerns have been raised over chemicals getting into the water table and minor earthquakes damaging homes.[349][350] In the late 1990s, nuclear power plants contributed around 25 per cent of total annual electricity generation in the UK, but this has gradually declined as old plants have been shut down and ageing-related problems affect plant availability. In 2012, the UK had 16 reactors normally generating about 19 per cent of its electricity. All but one of the reactors will be retired by 2023. Unlike Germany and Japan, the UK intends to build a new generation of nuclear plants from about 2018.[351] The total of all renewable electricity sources provided for 38.9 per cent of the electricity generated in the United Kingdom in the third quarter of 2019, producing 28.8TWh of electricity.[352] The UK is one of the best sites in Europe for wind energy, and wind power production is its fastest growing supply, in 2019 it generated almost 20 per cent of the UK's total electricity.[353] Water supply and sanitation Main article: Water supply and sanitation in the United Kingdom Access to improved water supply and sanitation in the UK is universal. It is estimated that 96.7 per cent of households are connected to the sewer network.[354] According to the Environment Agency, total water abstraction for public water supply in the UK was 16,406 megalitres per day in 2007.[355] In England and Wales water and sewerage services are provided by 10 private regional water and sewerage companies and 13 mostly smaller private ""water only"" companies. In Scotland water and sewerage services are provided by a single public company, Scottish Water. In Northern Ireland water and sewerage services are also provided by a single public entity, Northern Ireland Water.[356] Demographics Main article: Demography of the United Kingdom Map of population density in the UK as at the 2011 census A census is taken simultaneously in all parts of the UK every 10 years.[357] In the 2011 census the total population of the United Kingdom was 63,181,775.[358] It is the fourth-largest in Europe (after Russia, Germany and France), the fifth-largest in the Commonwealth and the 22nd-largest in the world. In mid-2014 and mid-2015 net long-term international migration contributed more to population growth. In mid-2012 and mid-2013 natural change contributed the most to population growth.[359] Between 2001 and 2011 the population increased by an average annual rate of approximately 0.7 per cent.[358] This compares to 0.3 per cent per year in the period 1991 to 2001 and 0.2 per cent in the decade 1981 to 1991.[360] The 2011 census also confirmed that the proportion of the population aged 0–14 has nearly halved (31 per cent in 1911 compared to 18 in 2011) and the proportion of older people aged 65 and over has more than tripled (from 5 per cent to 16 per cent).[358] England's population in 2011 was 53 million.[361] It is one of the most densely populated countries in the world, with 420 people resident per square kilometre in mid-2015,[359] with a particular concentration in London and the south-east.[362] The 2011 census put Scotland's population at 5.3 million,[363] Wales at 3.06 million and Northern Ireland at 1.81 million.[361] In 2017 the average total fertility rate (TFR) across the UK was 1.74 children born per woman.[364] While a rising birth rate is contributing to population growth, it remains considerably below the baby boom peak of 2.95 children per woman in 1964,[365] or the high of 6.02 children born per woman in 1815,[366] below the replacement rate of 2.1, but higher than the 2001 record low of 1.63.[367] In 2011, 47.3 per cent of births in the UK were to unmarried women.[368] The Office for National Statistics published a bulletin in 2015 showing that, out of the UK population aged 16 and over, 1.7 per cent identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual (2.0 per cent of males and 1.5 per cent of females); 4.5 per cent of respondents responded with ""other"", ""I don't know"", or did not respond.[369] In 2018 the median age of the UK population was 41.7 years.[370] vte Largest urban areas of the United Kingdom(England and Wales: 2011 census built-up area;[371] Scotland: 2016 estimates settlement;[372] Northern Ireland: 2001 census urban area)[373] Rank Urban area Pop.

Welsh people could be the oldest ethnic group in the UK.[374] A 2006 genetic study shows that more than 50 per cent of England's gene pool contains Germanic Y chromosomes.[375] Another 2005 genetic analysis indicates that ""about 75 per cent of the traceable ancestors of the modern British population had arrived in the British isles by about 6,200 years ago, at the start of the British Neolithic or Stone Age"", and that the British broadly share a common ancestry with the Basque people.[376][377][378][needs update] The UK has a history of non-white immigration with Liverpool having the oldest Black population in the country dating back to at least the 1730s during the period of the African slave trade. During this period it is estimated the Afro-Caribbean population of Great Britain was 10,000 to 15,000[379] which later declined due to the abolition of slavery.[380][381] The UK also has the oldest Chinese community in Europe, dating to the arrival of Chinese seamen in the 19th century.[382] In 1950 there were probably fewer than 20,000 non-white residents in Britain, almost all born overseas.[383] In 1951 there were an estimated 94,500 people living in Britain who had been born in South Asia, China, Africa and the Caribbean, just under 0.2 per cent of the UK population. By 1961 this number had more than quadrupled to 384,000, just over 0.7 per cent of the United Kingdom population.[384] Since 1948 substantial immigration from Africa, the Caribbean and South Asia has been a legacy of ties forged by the British Empire.[385] Migration from new EU member states in Central and Eastern Europe since 2004 has resulted in growth in these population groups, although some of this migration has been temporary.[386] Since the 1990s, there has been substantial diversification of the immigrant population, with migrants to the UK coming from a much wider range of countries than previous waves, which tended to involve larger numbers of migrants coming from a relatively small number of countries.[387][388][389] Academics have argued that the ethnicity categories employed in British national statistics, which were first introduced in the 1991 census, involve confusion between the concepts of ethnicity and race.[390][391] In 2011[update], 87.2 per cent of the UK population identified themselves as white, meaning 12.8 per cent of the UK population identify themselves as of one of number of ethnic minority groups.[392] In the 2001 census, this figure was 7.9 per cent of the UK population.[393] Because of differences in the wording of the census forms used in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, data on the Other White group is not available for the UK as a whole, but in England and Wales this was the fastest growing group between the 2001 and 2011 censuses, increasing by 1.1 million (1.8 percentage points).[394] Amongst groups for which comparable data is available for all parts of the UK level, the Other Asian category increased from 0.4 per cent to 1.4 per cent of the population between 2001 and 2011, while the Mixed category rose from 1.2 per cent to 2 per cent.[392] Ethnic group Population (absolute) Population (per cent) 2001[395] 2011 2011[392] White 54,153,898 (92.14%) 55,010,359 (87.1%) 087.1 % White: Gypsy / Traveller /Irish Traveller[note 14] – 63,193 000.1 % Asian /Asian British Indian 1,053,411 1,451,862 002.3 % Pakistani 747,285 1,174,983 001.9 % Bangladeshi 283,063 451,529 000.7 % Chinese 247,403 433,150 000.7 % other Asian 247,664 861,815 001.4 % Black / African / Caribbean /Black British 1,148,738 1,904,684[note 15] 003.0 % mixed / multiple ethnic groups 677,117 1,250,229 002.0 % other ethnic group 230,615 580,374 000.9 % Total 58,789,194 63,182,178 100.0 % Ethnic diversity varies significantly across the UK. 30.4 per cent of London's population and 37.4 per cent of Leicester's was estimated to be non-white in 2005[update],[398][399] whereas less than 5 per cent of the populations of North East England, Wales and the South West were from ethnic minorities, according to the 2001 census.[400] In 2016[update], 31.4 per cent of primary and 27.9 per cent of secondary pupils at state schools in England were members of an ethnic minority.[401] The 1991 census was the first UK census to have a question on ethnic group. In the 1991 UK census 94.1 per cent of people reported themselves as being White British, White Irish or White Other with 5.9 per cent of people reporting themselves as coming from other minority groups.[402] Languages Main article: Languages of the United Kingdom The UK's de facto official language is English.[403][404] It is estimated that 95 per cent of the UK's population are monolingual English speakers.[405] 5.5 per cent of the population are estimated to speak languages brought to the UK as a result of relatively recent immigration.[405] South Asian languages are the largest grouping which includes Punjabi, Urdu, Bengali/Sylheti, Hindi and Gujarati.[406] According to the 2011 census, Polish has become the second-largest language spoken in England and has 546,000 speakers.[407] In 2019, some three quarters of a million people spoke little or no English.[408] Three indigenous Celtic languages are spoken in the UK: Welsh, Irish and Scottish Gaelic. Cornish, which became extinct as a first language in the late 18th century, is subject to revival efforts and has a small group of second language speakers.[409][410][2][411] In the 2011 Census, approximately one-fifth (19 per cent) of the population of Wales said they could speak Welsh,[412][413] an increase from the 1991 Census (18 per cent).[414] In addition, it is estimated that about 200,000 Welsh speakers live in England.[415] In the same census in Northern Ireland 167,487 people (10.4 per cent) stated that they had ""some knowledge of Irish"" (see Irish language in Northern Ireland), almost exclusively in the nationalist (mainly Catholic) population. Over 92,000 people in Scotland (just under 2 per cent of the population) had some Gaelic language ability, including 72 per cent of those living in the Outer Hebrides.[416] The number of children being taught either Welsh or Scottish Gaelic is increasing.[417] Among emigrant-descended populations some Scottish Gaelic is still spoken in Canada (principally Nova Scotia and Cape Breton Island),[418] and Welsh in Patagonia, Argentina.[419] Scots, a language descended from early northern Middle English, has limited recognition alongside its regional variant, Ulster Scots in Northern Ireland, without specific commitments to protection and promotion.[2][420] It is compulsory for pupils to study a second language up to the age of 14 in England.[421] French and German are the two most commonly taught second languages in England and Scotland. All pupils in Wales are either taught Welsh as a second language up to age 16, or are taught in Welsh as a first language.[422] Religion Main article: Religion in the United Kingdom Westminster Abbey Forms of Christianity have dominated religious life in what is now the United Kingdom for over 1,400 years.[423] Although a majority of citizens still identify with Christianity in many surveys, regular church attendance has fallen dramatically since the middle of the 20th century,[424] while immigration and demographic change have contributed to the growth of other faiths, most notably Islam.[425] This has led some commentators to variously describe the UK as a multi-faith,[426] secularised,[427] or post-Christian society.[428] In the 2001 census 71.6 per cent of all respondents indicated that they were Christians, with the next largest faiths being Islam (2.8 per cent), Hinduism (1.0 per cent), Sikhism (0.6 per cent), Judaism (0.5 per cent), Buddhism (0.3 per cent) and all other religions (0.3 per cent).[429] 15 per cent of respondents stated that they had no religion, with a further 7 per cent not stating a religious preference.[430] A Tearfund survey in 2007 showed only one in 10 Britons actually attend church weekly.[431] Between the 2001 and 2011 census there was a decrease in the number of people who identified as Christian by 12 per cent, whilst the percentage of those reporting no religious affiliation doubled. This contrasted with growth in the other main religious group categories, with the number of Muslims increasing by the most substantial margin to a total of about 5 per cent.[7] The Muslim population has increased from 1.6 million in 2001 to 2.7 million in 2011, making it the second-largest religious group in the United Kingdom.[432] In a 2016 survey conducted by BSA (British Social Attitudes) on religious affiliation; 53 per cent of respondents indicated 'no religion', while 41 per cent indicated they were Christians, followed by 6 per cent who affiliated with other religions (e.g. Islam, Hinduism, Judaism, etc.).[433] Among Christians, adherents to the Church of England constituted 15 per cent, Catholic Church 9 per cent, and other Christians (including Presbyterians, Methodists, other Protestants, as well as Eastern Orthodox), 17 per cent.[433] 71 per cent of young people aged 18––24 said they had no religion.[433] The Church of England is the established church in England.[434] It retains a representation in the UK Parliament and the British monarch is its Supreme Governor.[435] In Scotland, the Church of Scotland is recognised as the national church. It is not subject to state control, and the British monarch is an ordinary member, required to swear an oath to ""maintain and preserve the Protestant Religion and Presbyterian Church Government"" upon his or her accession.[436][437] The Church in Wales was disestablished in 1920 and, as the Church of Ireland was disestablished in 1870 before the partition of Ireland, there is no established church in Northern Ireland.[438] Although there are no UK-wide data in the 2001 census on adherence to individual Christian denominations, it has been estimated that 62 per cent of Christians are Anglican, 13.5 per cent Catholic, 6 per cent Presbyterian, and 3.4 per cent Methodist, with small numbers of other Protestant denominations such as Plymouth Brethren, and Orthodox churches.[439] Migration Main article: Modern immigration to the United Kingdom See also: Foreign-born population of the United Kingdom Estimated foreign-born population by country of birth from April 2007 to March 2008 The United Kingdom has experienced successive waves of migration. The Great Famine in Ireland, then part of the United Kingdom, resulted in perhaps a million people migrating to Great Britain.[440] Throughout the 19th century a small population of 28,644 German immigrants built up in England and Wales. London held around half of this population, and other small communities existed in Manchester, Bradford and elsewhere. The German immigrant community was the largest group until 1891, when it became second to Russian Jews.[441] After 1881, Russian Jews suffered bitter persecutions and 2,000,000 left the Russian Empire by 1914. Around 120,000 settled permanently in Britain, becoming the largest ethnic minority from outside the British Isles;[442][443] this population had increased to 370,000 by 1938.[444][445][446] Unable to return to Poland at the end of World War II, over 120,000 Polish veterans remained in the UK permanently.[447] After the Second World War, many people immigrated from colonies and former-colonies in the Caribbean and Indian subcontinent, as a legacy of empire or driven by labour shortages.[448] In 1841, 0.25 per cent of the population of England and Wales was born in a foreign country, increasing to 1.5 per cent by 1901,[449] 2.6 per cent by 1931 and 4.4 per cent in 1951.[450] In 2014 the immigration net increase was 318,000: Immigration was at 641,000, up from 526,000 in 2013, while the number of emigrants leaving for over a year was 323,000.[451] A recent migration trend has been the arrival of workers from the new EU member states in Eastern Europe, known as the A8 countries.[386] In 2011, citizens of new EU member states made up 13 per cent of immigrants.[452] The UK applied temporary restrictions to citizens of Romania and Bulgaria, which joined the EU in January 2007.[453] Research conducted by the Migration Policy Institute for the Equality and Human Rights Commission suggests that, between May 2004 and September 2009, 1.5 million workers migrated from the new EU member states to the UK, most of them Polish. Many subsequently returned home, resulting in a net increase in the number of nationals of the new member states in the UK.[454][455] The late-2000s recession in the UK reduced economic incentive for Poles to migrate to the UK,[456] making migration temporary and circular.[457] The proportion of foreign-born people in the UK remains slightly below that of many other European countries.[458] Immigration is now contributing to a rising population,[459] with arrivals and UK-born children of migrants accounting for about half of the population increase between 1991 and 2001. 27 per cent of UK live births in 2014 were to mothers born outside the UK, according to official statistics released in 2015.[460] The ONS reported that net migration rose from 2009 to 2010 by 21 per cent to 239,000.[461] In 2013, approximately 208,000 foreign nationals were naturalised as British citizens, the highest number since 1962. This figure fell to around 125,800 in 2014. Between 2009 and 2013, the average British citizenships granted annually was195,800. The most common previous nationalities of those naturalised in 2014 were India, Pakistan, the Philippines, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Nepal, China, South Africa, Poland and Somalia.[462] The total number of grants of settlement, which confer permanent residence in the UK but not citizenship,[463] was approximately 154,700 in 2013, higher than the previous two years.[462] Year Foreign born population of England and Wales Total population[450][464][449][465][466][467] Irish born population Percentage of total population that was born abroad 1851 100,000 17,900,000 520,000 0.6 1861 150,000 20,100,000 600,000 0.7 1871 200,000 22,700,000 565,000 0.9 1881 275,000 26,000,000 560,000 1.1 1891 350,000 29,000,000 460,000 1.2 1901 475,000 32,500,000 425,000 1.5 1911 900,000 32,500,000 375,000 2.5 1921 750,000 37,900,000 365,000 2 1931 1,080,000 40,000,000 380,000 2.7 1951 1,875,000 43,700,000 470,000 4.3 1961 2,290,000 46,000,000 645,000 5.0 1971 3,100,000 48,700,000 585,000 6.4 1981 3,220,000 48,500,000 580,000 6.6 1991 3,625,000 49,900,000 570,000 7.3 2001 4,600,000 52,500,000 475,000 8.8 2011 7,500,000 56,000,000 400,000 13.4 Estimated number of British citizens living overseas by country in 2006 In 2008, the British Government introduced a points-based immigration system for immigration from outside the European Economic Area to replace former schemes, including the Scottish Government's Fresh Talent Initiative.[468] In June 2010 a temporary limit on immigration from outside the EU was introduced, aiming to discourage applications before a permanent cap was imposed in April 2011.[469] Emigration was an important feature of British society in the 19th century. Between 1815 and 1930, around 11.4 million people emigrated from Britain and 7.3 million from Ireland. Estimates show that by the end of the 20th century, some 300 million people of British and Irish descent were permanently settled around the globe.[470] Today, at least 5.5 million UK-born people live abroad,[471][472][473] mainly in Australia, Spain, the United States and Canada.[471][474] Education Main article: Education in the United Kingdom Education in the United Kingdom is a devolved matter, with each country having a separate education system. Considering the four systems together, about 38 per cent of the United Kingdom population has a university or college degree, which is the highest percentage in Europe, and among the highest percentages in the world.[475][476] The United Kingdom trails only the United States in terms of representation on lists of top 100 universities.[477][478][479][480] A government commission's report in 2014 found that privately educated people comprise 7 per cent of the general population of the UK but much larger percentages of the top professions, the most extreme case quoted being 71 per cent of senior judges.[481][482] In 2018, more than 57,000 children were being homeschooled in the United Kingdom.[483] England Main article: Education in England Christ Church, Oxford, is part of the University of Oxford, which traces its foundations back to c. 1096. Whilst education in England is the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Education, the day-to-day administration and funding of state schools is the responsibility of local authorities.[484] Universally free of charge state education was introduced piecemeal between 1870 and 1944.[485][486] Education is now mandatory from ages 5 to 16, and in England youngsters must stay in education or training until they are 18.[487] In 2011, the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) rated 13–14-year-old pupils in England and Wales 10th in the world for maths and 9th for science.[488] The majority of children are educated in state-sector schools, a small proportion of which select on the grounds of academic ability. Two of the top 10 performing schools in terms of GCSE results in 2006 were state-run grammar schools. In 2010, over half of places at the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge were taken by students from state schools,[489] while the proportion of children in England attending private schools is around 7 per cent, which rises to 18 per cent of those over 16.[490][491] King's College (right) and Clare College (left), both part of the University of Cambridge, which was founded in 1209 New College of the University of Edinburgh Scotland Main article: Education in Scotland Education in Scotland is the responsibility of the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning, with day-to-day administration and funding of state schools the responsibility of Local Authorities. Two non-departmental public bodies have key roles in Scottish education. The Scottish Qualifications Authority is responsible for the development, accreditation, assessment and certification of qualifications other than degrees which are delivered at secondary schools, post-secondary colleges of further education and other centres.[492] Learning and Teaching Scotland provides advice, resources and staff development to education professionals.[493] Scotland first legislated for compulsory education in 1496.[494] The proportion of children in Scotland attending private schools is just over 4 per cent in 2016, but it has been falling slowly in recent years.[495] Scottish students who attend Scottish universities pay neither tuition fees nor graduate endowment charges, as fees were abolished in 2001 and the graduate endowment scheme was abolished in 2008.[496] Wales Main article: Education in Wales The Welsh Government's Minister for Education has responsibility for education in Wales. A significant number of Welsh students are taught either wholly or largely in the Welsh language; lessons in Welsh are compulsory for all until the age of 16.[497] As part of the Welsh Government's long-term vision of achieving a million Welsh speakers in Wales by 2050, there are plans to increase the proportion of learners in each school year group receiving Welsh-medium education from 22 per cent in 2017 to 40 per cent by 2050.[498] Northern Ireland Main article: Education in Northern Ireland Education in Northern Ireland is the responsibility of the Minister of Education, although responsibility at a local level is administered by the Education Authority which is further sub-divided into five geographical areas. The Council for the Curriculum, Examinations & Assessment (CCEA) is the body responsible for advising the government on what should be taught in Northern Ireland's schools, monitoring standards and awarding qualifications.[499] Health Main articles: Health in the United Kingdom and Healthcare in the United Kingdom The Royal Aberdeen Children's Hospital, an NHS Scotland specialist children's hospital Healthcare in the United Kingdom is a devolved matter and each country has its own system of private and publicly funded health care. Public healthcare is provided to all UK permanent residents and is mostly free at the point of need, being paid for from general taxation. The World Health Organization, in 2000, ranked the provision of healthcare in the United Kingdom as fifteenth best in Europe and eighteenth in the world.[500][501] Since 1979 expenditure on healthcare has been increased significantly.[502] The UK spends around 8.4 per cent of its gross domestic product on healthcare, which is 0.5 percentage points below the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average.[503] Regulatory bodies are organised on a UK-wide basis such as the General Medical Council, the Nursing and Midwifery Council and non-governmental-based, such as the Royal Colleges. Political and operational responsibility for healthcare lies with four national executives; healthcare in England is the responsibility of the UK Government; healthcare in Northern Ireland is the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Executive; healthcare in Scotland is the responsibility of the Scottish Government; and healthcare in Wales is the responsibility of the Welsh Government. Each National Health Service has different policies and priorities, resulting in contrasts.[504][505] Culture Main article: Culture of the United Kingdom The culture of the United Kingdom has been influenced by many factors including: the nation's island status; its history as a western liberal democracy and a major power; as well as being a political union of four countries with each preserving elements of distinctive traditions, customs and symbolism. As a result of the British Empire, British influence can be observed in the language, culture and legal systems of many of its former colonies including Australia, Canada, India, Ireland, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa and the United States; a common culture coined today as the Anglosphere. The substantial cultural influence of the United Kingdom has led it to be described as a ""cultural superpower"".[136][137] A global opinion poll for the BBC saw the United Kingdom ranked the third most positively viewed nation in the world (behind Germany and Canada) in 2013 and 2014.[506][507] Literature Main article: British literature The Chandos portrait, believed to depict William Shakespeare ""British literature"" refers to literature associated with the United Kingdom, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. Most British literature is in the English language. In 2005, some 206,000 books were published in the United Kingdom and in 2006 it was the largest publisher of books in the world.[508] The English playwright and poet William Shakespeare is widely regarded as the greatest dramatist of all time.[509][510][511] The 20th-century English crime writer Agatha Christie is the best-selling novelist of all time.[512] Eight of the top 10 of 100 novels by British writers chosen by a BBC poll of global critics were written by women; these included works by George Eliot, Virginia Woolf, Charlotte and Emily Bronte, and Mary Shelley.[513] A photograph of Victorian-era novelist Charles Dickens Scotland's contributions include the detective writer Arthur Conan Doyle (the creator of Sherlock Holmes), romantic literature by Sir Walter Scott, the children's writer J. M. Barrie, the epic adventures of Robert Louis Stevenson and the celebrated poet Robert Burns. More recently the modernist and nationalist Hugh MacDiarmid and Neil M. Gunn contributed to the Scottish Renaissance. A more grim outlook is found in Ian Rankin's stories and the psychological horror-comedy of Iain Banks. Scotland's capital, Edinburgh, was UNESCO's first worldwide City of Literature.[514] Britain's oldest known poem, Y Gododdin, was composed in Yr Hen Ogledd (The Old North), most likely in the late 6th century. It was written in Cumbric or Old Welsh and contains the earliest known reference to King Arthur.[515] From around the 7th century, the connection between Wales and the Old North was lost, and the focus of Welsh-language culture shifted to Wales, where Arthurian legend was further developed by Geoffrey of Monmouth.[516] Wales's most celebrated medieval poet, Dafydd ap Gwilym (fl. 1320–1370), composed poetry on themes including nature, religion and especially love. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest European poets of his age.[517] Until the late 19th century the majority of Welsh literature was in Welsh and much of the prose was religious in character. Daniel Owen is credited as the first Welsh-language novelist, publishing Rhys Lewis in 1885. The best-known of the Anglo-Welsh poets are both Thomases. Dylan Thomas became famous on both sides of the Atlantic in the mid-20th century. He is remembered for his poetry – his ""Do not go gentle into that good night; Rage, rage against the dying of the light"" is one of the most quoted couplets of English language verse – and for his ""play for voices"", Under Milk Wood. The influential Church in Wales ""poet-priest"" and Welsh nationalist R. S. Thomas was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1996. Leading Welsh novelists of the twentieth century include Richard Llewellyn and Kate Roberts.[518][519] There have been a number of authors whose origins were from outside the United Kingdom but who moved to the UK and became British. These include Joseph Conrad,[520] T. S. Eliot,[521] Kazuo Ishiguro[522] and Sir Salman Rushdie.[523] Others have chosen to live and work in the UK without taking up British citizenship, such as Ezra Pound.[524][525] Historically, a number of Irish writers, living at a time when all of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom, also spent much of their working lives in England. These include Oscar Wilde,[526][527] Bram Stoker[528] and George Bernard Shaw.[529][530] Music Main article: Music of the United Kingdom See also: Rock music in the United Kingdom The Beatles are the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed band in popular music, selling over a billion records.[531][532][533] Various styles of music are popular in the UK, including the indigenous folk music of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Notable composers of classical music from the United Kingdom and the countries that preceded it include William Byrd, Henry Purcell, Sir Edward Elgar, Gustav Holst, Sir Arthur Sullivan (most famous for working with the librettist Sir W. S. Gilbert), Ralph Vaughan Williams and Benjamin Britten, pioneer of modern British opera. Sir Harrison Birtwistle is one of the foremost living composers. The UK is also home to world-renowned symphonic orchestras and choruses such as the BBC Symphony Orchestra and the London Symphony Chorus. Notable conductors include Sir Simon Rattle, Sir John Barbirolli and Sir Malcolm Sargent. Some of the notable film score composers include John Barry, Clint Mansell, Mike Oldfield, John Powell, Craig Armstrong, David Arnold, John Murphy, Monty Norman and Harry Gregson-Williams. George Frideric Handel became a naturalised British citizen and wrote the British coronation anthem, while some of his best works, such as Messiah, were written in the English language.[534][535] Andrew Lloyd Webber is a prolific composer of musical theatre. His works have dominated London's West End since the late 20th century and have also been a commercial success worldwide.[536] According to the website of The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, the term ""pop music"" originated in Britain in the mid-1950s to describe rock and roll's fusion with the ""new youth music"".[537] The Oxford Dictionary of Music states that artists such as The Beatles and The Rolling Stones drove pop music to the forefront of popular music in the early 1960s.[538] In the following years, Britain widely occupied a part in the development of rock music, with British acts pioneering hard rock;[539] raga rock;[540][incomplete short citation] art rock;[541][incomplete short citation] heavy metal;[542] space rock; glam rock;[543] new wave;[citation needed] Gothic rock,[544] and ska punk. In addition, British acts developed progressive rock;[545][incomplete short citation] psychedelic rock;[546] and punk rock.[547] Besides rock music, British acts also developed neo soul and created dubstep.[548][549][550] The Beatles have international sales of over 1 billion units and are the biggest-selling and most influential band in the history of popular music.[531][532][533][551] Other prominent British contributors to have influenced popular music over the last 50 years include The Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, Queen, Led Zeppelin, the Bee Gees, and Elton John, all of whom have worldwide record sales of 200 million or more.[552][553][554][555][556][557] The Brit Awards are the BPI's annual music awards, and some of the British recipients of the Outstanding Contribution to Music award include; The Who, David Bowie, Eric Clapton, Rod Stewart, The Police, and Fleetwood Mac (who are a British-American band).[558] More recent UK music acts that have had international success include George Michael, Oasis, Spice Girls, Radiohead, Coldplay, Arctic Monkeys, Robbie Williams, Amy Winehouse, Adele, Ed Sheeran, One Direction and Harry Styles.[559][560][561][562] A number of UK cities are known for their music. Acts from Liverpool have had 54 UK chart number 1 hit singles, more per capita than any other city worldwide.[563] Glasgow's contribution to music was recognised in 2008 when it was named a UNESCO City of Music, one of only three cities in the world to have this honour.[564] Manchester played a role in the spread of dance music such as acid house, and from the mid-1990s, Britpop. London and Bristol are closely associated with the origins of electronic music sub-genres such as drum and bass and trip hop.[565] Pop remains the most popular music genre in the UK, with 33.4 per cent of unit sales in 2016, followed by hip-hop and R&B at 24.5 per cent of unit sales.[566] Rock is not far behind, at 22.6 per cent of unit sales.[566] The modern UK is known to produce some of the most prominent English-speaking rappers along with the United States, including Stormzy, Kano, Yxng Bane, Ramz and Skepta.[567] Visual art Main article: Art of the United Kingdom J. M. W. Turner self-portrait, oil on canvas, c. 1799 The history of British visual art forms part of western art history. Major British artists include: the Romantics William Blake, John Constable, Samuel Palmer and J.M.W. Turner; the portrait painters Sir Joshua Reynolds and Lucian Freud; the landscape artists Thomas Gainsborough and L. S. Lowry; the pioneer of the Arts and Crafts Movement William Morris; the figurative painter Francis Bacon; the Pop artists Peter Blake, Richard Hamilton and David Hockney; the pioneers of Conceptual art movement Art & Language;[568] the collaborative duo Gilbert and George; the abstract artist Howard Hodgkin; and the sculptors Antony Gormley, Anish Kapoor and Henry Moore. During the late 1980s and 1990s the Saatchi Gallery in London helped to bring to public attention a group of multi-genre artists who would become known as the ""Young British Artists"": Damien Hirst, Chris Ofili, Rachel Whiteread, Tracey Emin, Mark Wallinger, Steve McQueen, Sam Taylor-Wood and the Chapman Brothers are among the better-known members of this loosely affiliated movement. The Royal Academy in London is a key organisation for the promotion of the visual arts in the United Kingdom. Major schools of art in the UK include: the six-school University of the Arts London, which includes the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design and Chelsea College of Art and Design; Goldsmiths, University of London; the Slade School of Fine Art (part of University College London); the Glasgow School of Art; the Royal College of Art; and The Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art (part of the University of Oxford). The Courtauld Institute of Art is a leading centre for the teaching of the history of art. Important art galleries in the United Kingdom include the National Gallery, National Portrait Gallery, Tate Britain and Tate Modern (the most-visited modern art gallery in the world, with around 4.7 million visitors per year).[569] Cinema Main article: Cinema of the United Kingdom Alfred Hitchcock has been ranked as one of the greatest and most influential British filmmakers of all time.[570] The United Kingdom has had a considerable influence on the history of the cinema. The British directors Alfred Hitchcock, whose film Vertigo is considered by some critics as the best film of all time,[571] and David Lean are among the most critically acclaimed of all time.[572] Many British actors have achieved international fame and critical success. Some of the most commercially successful films of all time have been produced in the United Kingdom, including two of the highest-grossing film franchises (Harry Potter and James Bond).[573] Ealing Studios has a claim to being the oldest continuously working film studio in the world.[574] In 2009, British films grossed around $2 billion worldwide and achieved a market share of around 7 per cent globally and 17 per cent in the United Kingdom.[575] UK box-office takings totalled £944 million in 2009, with around 173 million admissions.[575] The annual British Academy Film Awards are hosted by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.[576] Cuisine Main article: British cuisine British cuisine developed from various influences reflective of its land, settlements, arrivals of new settlers and immigrants, trade and colonialism. Celtic agriculture and animal breeding produced a wide variety of foodstuffs for indigenous Celts and Britons. Anglo-Saxon England developed meat and savoury herb stewing techniques before the practice became common in Europe. The Norman conquest introduced exotic spices into England in the Middle Ages.[577] The British Empire facilitated a knowledge of Indian cuisine with its ""strong, penetrating spices and herbs"". British cuisine has absorbed the cultural influence of those who have settled in Britain, producing many hybrid dishes, such as the Anglo-Indian chicken tikka masala.[578][579] Media Main article: Media of the United Kingdom Broadcasting House in London, headquarters of the BBC, the oldest and largest broadcaster in the world[580][581][582] The BBC, founded in 1922, is the UK's publicly funded radio, television and Internet broadcasting corporation, and is the oldest and largest broadcaster in the world.[580][581][582] It operates numerous television and radio stations in the UK and abroad and its domestic services are funded by the television licence.[583][584] Other major players in the UK media include ITV plc, which operates 11 of the 15 regional television broadcasters that make up the ITV Network,[585] and News Corporation, which owns a number of national newspapers through News International such as the most popular tabloid The Sun and the longest-established daily ""broadsheet"" The Times,[586] as well as holding a large stake in satellite broadcaster British Sky Broadcasting until 2018.[587][588] London dominates the media sector in the UK: national newspapers and television and radio are largely based there, although Manchester is also a significant national media centre. Edinburgh and Glasgow, and Cardiff, are important centres of newspaper and broadcasting production in Scotland and Wales, respectively.[589] The UK publishing sector, including books, directories and databases, journals, magazines and business media, newspapers and news agencies, has a combined turnover of around £20 billion and employs around 167,000 people.[590] In 2009, it was estimated that individuals viewed a mean of 3.75 hours of television per day and 2.81 hours of radio. In that year the main BBC public service broadcasting channels accounted for an estimated 28.4 per cent of all television viewing; the three main independent channels accounted for 29.5 per cent and the increasingly important other satellite and digital channels for the remaining 42.1 per cent.[591] Sales of newspapers have fallen since the 1970s and in 2010 41 per cent of people reported reading a daily national newspaper.[592] In 2010, 82.5 per cent of the UK population were Internet users, the highest proportion amongst the 20 countries with the largest total number of users in that year.[593] Philosophy Main article: British philosophy The United Kingdom is famous for the tradition of 'British Empiricism', a branch of the philosophy of knowledge that states that only knowledge verified by experience is valid, and 'Scottish Philosophy', sometimes referred to as the 'Scottish School of Common Sense'.[594] The most famous philosophers of British Empiricism are John Locke, George Berkeley[note 16] and David Hume; while Dugald Stewart, Thomas Reid and William Hamilton were major exponents of the Scottish ""common sense"" school. Two Britons are also notable for the ethical theory of utilitarianism, a moral philosophy first used by Jeremy Bentham and later by John Stuart Mill in his short work Utilitarianism.[595][596] Sport Main article: Sport in the United Kingdom Wembley Stadium, London, home of the England national football team, is the fifth most expensive stadium ever built.[597] Association football, tennis, table tennis, badminton, rugby union, rugby league, rugby sevens, golf, boxing, netball, water polo, field hockey, billiards, darts, rowing, rounders and cricket originated or were substantially developed in the UK, with the rules and codes of many modern sports invented and codified in the late 19th century Victorian Britain. In 2012, the President of the IOC, Jacques Rogge, stated, ""This great, sports-loving country is widely recognised as the birthplace of modern sport. It was here that the concepts of sportsmanship and fair play were first codified into clear rules and regulations. It was here that sport was included as an educational tool in the school curriculum"".[598][599] A 2003 poll found that football is the most popular sport in the United Kingdom.[600] England is recognised by FIFA as the birthplace of club football, and The Football Association is the oldest of its kind, with the rules of football first drafted in 1863 by Ebenezer Cobb Morley.[601][602] Each of the Home Nations has its own football association, national team and league system and individually are the governing members of the International Football Association Board alongside FIFA. The English top division, the Premier League, is the most watched football league in the world.[603] The first international football match was contested by England and Scotland on 30 November 1872.[604] England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland usually compete as separate countries in international competitions.[605] The Millennium Stadium of Cardiff opened for the 1999 Rugby World Cup. In 2003, rugby union was ranked the second most popular sport in the UK.[600] The sport was created in Rugby School, Warwickshire, and the first rugby international took place on 27 March 1871 between England and Scotland.[606][607] England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, France and Italy compete in the Six Nations Championship; the premier international tournament in the northern hemisphere. Sport governing bodies in England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland organise and regulate the game separately.[608] Every four years, England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales make a combined team known as the British and Irish Lions. The team tours Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. Cricket was invented in England, and its laws were established by the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1788.[609] The England cricket team, controlled by the England and Wales Cricket Board,[610] and the Irish cricket team, controlled by Cricket Ireland are the only national teams in the UK with Test status. Team members are drawn from the main county sides, and include both English and Welsh players. Cricket is distinct from football and rugby where Wales and England field separate national teams, although Wales had fielded its own team in the past. Irish and Scottish players have played for England because neither Scotland nor Ireland have Test status and have only recently started to play in One Day Internationals.[611][612] Scotland, England (and Wales), and Ireland (including Northern Ireland) have competed at the Cricket World Cup, with England winning the tournament in 2019. There is a professional league championship in which clubs representing 17 English counties and 1 Welsh county compete.[613] Wimbledon, the oldest Grand Slam tennis tournament, is held in Wimbledon, London every June and July. The modern game of tennis originated in Birmingham, England, in the 1860s, before spreading around the world.[614] The world's oldest tennis tournament, the Wimbledon championships, first occurred in 1877, and today the event takes place over two weeks in late June and early July.[615] The UK is closely associated with motorsport. Many teams and drivers in Formula One (F1) are based in the UK, and the country has won more drivers' and constructors' titles than any other. The UK hosted the first F1 Grand Prix in 1950 at Silverstone, the location of the British Grand Prix held each year in July.[616] St Andrews, Scotland, the home of golf. The standard 18 hole golf course was created at St Andrews in 1764.[617] Golf is the sixth most popular sport, by participation, in the UK. Although The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews in Scotland is the sport's home course,[618] the world's oldest golf course is actually Musselburgh Links' Old Golf Course.[619] In 1764, the standard 18-hole golf course was created at St Andrews when members modified the course from 22 to 18 holes.[617] The oldest golf tournament in the world, and the first major championship in golf, The Open Championship, is played annually on the weekend of the third Friday in July.[620] Rugby league originated in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire in 1895 and is generally played in Northern England.[621] A single 'Great Britain Lions' team had competed in the Rugby League World Cup and Test match games, but this changed in 2008 when England, Scotland and Ireland competed as separate nations.[622] Great Britain is still retained as the full national team. Super League is the highest level of professional rugby league in the UK and Europe. It consists of 11 teams from Northern England, and one each from London, Wales and France.[623] The 'Queensberry rules', the code of general rules in boxing, was named after John Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry in 1867, and formed the basis of modern boxing.[624] Snooker is another of the UK's popular sporting exports, with the world championships held annually in Sheffield.[625] In Northern Ireland Gaelic football and hurling are popular team sports, both in terms of participation and spectating, and Irish expatriates in the UK and the US also play them.[626] Shinty (or camanachd) is popular in the Scottish Highlands.[627] Highland games are held in spring and summer in Scotland, celebrating Scottish and celtic culture and heritage, especially that of the Scottish Highlands.[628] Symbols Main article: Symbols of the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man The Statue of Britannia in Plymouth. Britannia is a national personification of the UK. The flag of the United Kingdom is the Union Flag (also referred to as the Union Jack). It was created in 1606 by the superimposition of the Flag of England on the Flag of Scotland and updated in 1801 with the addition of Saint Patrick's Flag. Wales is not represented in the Union Flag, as Wales had been conquered and annexed to England prior to the formation of the United Kingdom. The possibility of redesigning the Union Flag to include representation of Wales has not been completely ruled out.[629] The national anthem of the United Kingdom is ""God Save the Queen"", with ""Queen"" replaced with ""King"" in the lyrics whenever the monarch is a man. Britannia is a national personification of the United Kingdom, originating from Roman Britain.[630] Britannia is symbolised as a young woman with brown or golden hair, wearing a Corinthian helmet and white robes. She holds Poseidon's three-pronged trident and a shield, bearing the Union Flag. Beside the lion and the unicorn and the dragon of heraldry, the bulldog is an iconic animal and commonly represented with the Union Jack. It has been associated with Winston Churchill's defiance of Nazi Germany.[631] A now rare personification is the character John Bull.

In the English tradition, such laws are not necessary; proclamation and usage are sufficient to make it the national anthem. ""God Save the Queen"" also serves as the Royal anthem for certain Commonwealth realms. The words Queen, she, her, used at present (in the reign of Elizabeth II), are replaced by King, he, him, his when the monarch is male. ^ The coat of arms on the left is used in England, Northern Ireland, and Wales; the version on the right is used in Scotland. ^ Scots, Ulster Scots, Welsh, Cornish, Scottish Gaelic and Irish are classed as regional or minority languages under the Council of Europe's European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.[2] These include defined obligations to promote those languages.[3][4][5] See also Languages of the United Kingdom.

The White Paper had indicated that this was to be the approach taken in the legislation. The Scottish Parliament is not to be seen as a reflection of the settled will of the people of Scotland or of popular sovereignty but as a reflection of its subordination to a higher legal authority. Following the logic of this argument, the power of the Scottish Parliament to legislate can be withdrawn or overridden... ^ Elliot, M. (2004). ""United Kingdom: Parliamentary sovereignty under pressure"". International Journal of Constitutional Law. 2 (3): 545–627, 553–554. doi:10.1093/icon/2.3.545. Notwithstanding substantial differences among the schemes, an important common factor is that the U.K. Parliament has not renounced legislative sovereignty in relation to the three nations concerned. For example, the Scottish Parliament is empowered to enact primary legislation on all matters, save those in relation to which competence is explicitly denied ... but this power to legislate on what may be termed ""devolved matters"" is concurrent with the Westminster Parliament's general power to legislate for Scotland on any matter at all, including devolved matters ... In theory, therefore, Westminster may legislate on Scottish devolved matters whenever it chooses... ^ Walker, G. (2010). ""Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Devolution, 1945–1979"". Journal of British Studies. 39 (1): 117–142. doi:10.1086/644536. ^ Gamble, A. (2006). ""The Constitutional Revolution in the United Kingdom"". Publius. 36 (1): 19–35 [p. 29]. doi:10.1093/publius/pjj011. The British parliament has the power to abolish the Scottish parliament and the Welsh assembly by a simple majority vote in both houses, but since both were sanctioned by referenda, it would be politically difficult to abolish them without the sanction of a further vote by the people. In this way, several of the constitutional measures introduced by the Blair government appear to be entrenched and not subject to a simple exercise of parliamentary sovereignty at Westminster. ^ Meehan, E. (1999). ""The Belfast Agreement – Its Distinctiveness and Points of Cross-Fertilization in the UK's Devolution Programme"". Parliamentary Affairs. 52 (1): 19–31 [p. 23]. doi:10.1093/pa/52.1.19. [T]he distinctive involvement of two governments in the Northern Irish problem means that Northern Ireland's new arrangements rest upon an intergovernmental agreement. If this can be equated with a treaty, it could be argued that the forthcoming distribution of power between Westminster and Belfast has similarities with divisions specified in the written constitutions of federal states...Although the Agreement makes the general proviso that Westminster's 'powers to make legislation for Northern Ireland' remains 'unaffected', without an explicit categorical reference to reserved matters, it may be more difficult than in Scotland or Wales for devolved powers to be repatriated. The retraction of devolved powers would not merely entail consultation in Northern Ireland backed implicitly by the absolute power of parliamentary sovereignty but also the renegotiation of an intergovernmental agreement. ^ ""CIBC PWM Global – Introduction to The Cayman Islands"".

She urged Western governments to share their prosperity with the rest of the world and in the 1960s turned her attention to environmental questions as well. She was an early advocate of sustainable development before this term became familiar and was well known as a journalist, lecturer and broadcaster. Ward was adviser to policy-makers in the UK, United States and elsewhere.

Her father was a solicitor with Quaker tendencies, while her mother was a devout Catholic. She attended a convent school before studying in Paris, first at a lycée, then for some months at the Sorbonne before going on to Germany. Though she had once planned to study modern languages, her interest in public affairs led to a degree course in politics, philosophy, and economics at Somerville College, Oxford University, from which she graduated in 1935.[1] She did post-graduate work on Austrian politics and economics. After witnessing antisemitism there and in Nazi Germany she began to help Jewish refugees, and mobilise Roman Catholic support for any forthcoming UK war effort, although she had initially been ""sympathetic to Hitler"".[2] With Christopher Dawson, the historian, as leader and Ward as secretary, the Sword of the Spirit was established as an organisation to bring together Catholics and Anglicans opposing Nazism. It became a Roman Catholic group whose policies were promoted by the Dublin Review, which Dawson edited, and for which Ward wrote regularly.[3] During the Second World War, she worked for the Ministry of Information and travelled in Europe and the US. Partly on the strength of her 1938 book, The International Share-out, Geoffrey Crowther, editor of The Economist, offered her a job. She left the magazine in 1950 having risen to foreign editor, but continued to contribute articles throughout her life. As well as writings on economic and foreign policy, her broadcasts on Christian values in wartime were published as The Defence of the West by Sword of the Spirit. During this time she was also president of the Catholic Women's League and a popular panel member of the BBC programme The Brains Trust which answered listeners' questions. In 1946 she became a governor of the BBC and of the Old Vic theatre. After the war, Ward was a supporter of the Marshall Plan, of a strong Europe, and of a European free trade area.[4] International influence, and marriage[edit] In 1950, Barbara Ward married Australian Commander Robert Jackson, an administrator for the United Nations. Their son Robert was born in 1956, the same year that his father was knighted. Ward continued to use her own name professionally and was not widely known as Lady Jackson. Over the next few years they lived in West Africa and made various visits to India, and these experiences helped form Ward's views on the need for Western nations to contribute to the economic development of poorer countries. For the next two decades both husband and wife travelled a great deal, and eventually their marriage suffered from this.[2] A legal separation was arranged in the early 1970s though Ward, as a Catholic, did not want divorce. In 1976 when she was given a life peerage she used her estranged husband's surname for her title as Baroness Jackson of Lodsworth.[1] Ward had been a frequent public speaker since leaving university, and by the 1960s her lectures attracted international respect; several lecture series, including some presented in Canada, Ghana and India, were published in book form. Ward spent increasing amounts of time in the US, much of her work there funded by the Carnegie Foundation. In 1957 Harvard University gave her an honorary LittD and until 1968 she was a Carnegie fellow there, living for part of each year in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1966.[5] She got to know Adlai Stevenson and John F Kennedy and acted as adviser to various influential policy makers, including Robert McNamara at the World Bank and Lyndon B Johnson, who welcomed her thoughts on his Great Society projects despite her opposition to the Vietnam war.[6] She influenced James Wolfensohn's thinking on development questions. She had influence in the Vatican, helped set up a pontifical commission for justice and peace, and in 1971 was the first woman ever to address a synod of Roman Catholic bishops. One of her proposals was that richer countries should commit a certain proportion of their GNP in aid to the developing world, and she also spoke of the need for institutions to enable and manage both 'aid and trade'. This was a practical as well as an ethical concern: Ward believed such policies would encourage stability and peace. She is sometimes called a ""distributist"".[6] Environmental concerns[edit] Ward started to see a close connection between wealth distribution and conservation of planetary resources. ""… the careful husbandry of the Earth is sine qua non for the survival of the human species, and for the creation of decent ways of life for all the people of the world.""[7] She used the phrases ""inner limits and ""outer limits"" to refer to the inner limits of the human right to an adequate standard of living and the outer limits of what the Earth can sustain.[8] In 1966, she published Spaceship Earth and is sometimes said to have coined the phrase. Ward is seen by some as a pioneer of sustainable development. She and René Dubos, co-authors of Only One Earth (ISBN 039330129X), have been described as ""parents"" of a concept which ""did not know its own name at first"".[9] Only One Earth: The Care and Maintenance of a Small Planet was written for the 1972 UN Stockholm conference on the Human Environment. The report was commissioned by Maurice Strong, secretary general of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment. Ward's work was rooted in her sense of morality and Christian values. She saw care of the environment and concern for the well-being of all humankind as a ""dual responsibility"", especially for anyone sharing her religious outlook.[10] At the same time, she believed wealth distribution combined with conservation was essentially a rational policy: ""We are a ship's company on a small ship. Rational behaviour is the condition of survival.""[11] In 1971 she founded the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED), acting as president from 1973 and chairman from 1980.[12] Later life[edit] Ward had recovered from cancer in the late 1940s thanks, she believed, to the spiritual support of Padre Pio. The illness recurred twenty years later but surgery did not cure her. In 1973 she retired from Columbia University where she had been Schweitzer Professor of Economic Development for the previous five years and went to live in Lodsworth, Sussex. The next year she was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire,[13] and on 18 October 1976 a life peer as Baroness Jackson of Lodsworth, of Lodsworth in the County of West Sussex;[14] she and her husband both held noble titles in their own right. She wrote her last book, Progress for a Small Planet, despite her deteriorating health, discussing the ""planetary community"", dwindling resources used up too fast by wealthy countries, and the needs of poorer parts of the world. It was published in 1979, two years before her death on 31 May 1981, aged 67. Legacy[edit] In 1980, she received the Jawaharlal Nehru Award.[15] Pope John Paul II sent a Cardinal to represent him at Ward's requiem service. At her own request, she was buried in the graveyard of the local Anglican parish church. Her brother, John Ward, was a noted civil engineer who, after his work on the M4 motorway in the 1960s, was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire. Her great-niece, Marsha Shandur, is now a music presenter on radio.

Many emerging economies are based on exporting natural resources to industrialised countries fuelling global markets in much needed raw materials. In accountable States, the income generated should be used to serve development needs, for example to finance the construction of infrastructures or programmes for poverty alleviation.

The aim of the Institute is to achieve a new paradigm for civilization and conduct innovative policy development and strategic research for environmental measures, reflecting the results of research into political decisions for realising sustainable development both in the Asia-Pacific region and globally. IGES made the transition to a Public Interest Incorporated Foundation in April 2012. According to the Charter for the Establishment of the IGES, the Institute will tackle fundamental challenges to human society, which exists thanks to the bounty of the global environment, and to redefine the values and value systems of our present societies that have resulted in the global environmental crisis, in order to create new ways of conducting activities and a new paradigm for civilization. Based on the principles of this new paradigm, new social and economic systems will be built, so that a new era of the global environment can begin. IGES also recognises that the realisation of sustainable development in the Asia-Pacific region is a vital issue for the international community, as the region is home to more than half of the world's population and is experiencing rapid economic growth. Thus the region plays a critical role in the protection of the global environment. By recognising these crucial issues, IGES will promote research cooperation with international organisations, governments, local governments, research institutions, business sectors, non-governmental organisations (NGO) and citizens. As well as conducting research, the Institute will share its research results and also host international conferences and study workshops.

Background[edit] ""The Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES), established by an initiative of the Japanese Government in 1998, is a research institute that conducts pragmatic and innovative strategic policy research to support sustainable development in the Asia-Pacific region. While the Asia-Pacific region is experiencing rapid economic growth and extensive urbanisation together with continued population increase, the region is still facing the issue of poverty. Efforts towards regional economic integration bring with them opportunities for further economic progress and poverty reduction but at the same time, there is concern that this will greatly increase the impact on natural resources and the environment through forest degradation, air and water pollution and an increase in waste generation. Climate change, the most urgent issue facing the world today, also presents the region with challenges: the region is one of the major sources of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and it is also likely to be affected by the severe impact of global warming on regional economies, society and the lives of ordinary citizens. In the face of mounting challenges, the mission of IGES is to create effective strategies and propose practical solutions to support sustainable development, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, while looking ahead 50 or even 100 years into the future. Expectations and requests are increasing that the Asia-Pacific region plays an important role in international efforts to deal with climate change and other critical environmental issues. It is vital to carry out appropriate policy proposals based on conditions in each area of the region, which is characterised by diversities in terms of economy, politics, culture and natural environment. IGES will enhance collaborations with a broad range of stakeholders such as national governments, local authorities, businesses, non-governmental organisations, citizens and experts, to carry out strategic policy research from an Asia-Pacific perspective and to disseminate the results around the world, so that it can contribute to the transition towards a sustainable society.""

Beginning in 2005, the Institute embarked on a “fast-action” climate mitigation campaign to promote strategies that will result in significant reductions of emissions, temperature, and impacts in the near-term, focusing primarily on strategies to reduce non-CO2 climate pollutants, to complement cuts in CO2. IGSD’s over-arching, multi-venue approach to fast-action climate mitigation is presented in a 2009 article by Molina, Zaelke, Sarma, Andersen, Ramanathan & Kaniaru, Reducing abrupt climate change risk using the Montreal Protocol and other regulatory actions to complement cuts in CO2 emissions in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.  The HFC part of this approach was further elaborated in a November 2012 article by Zaelke, Andersen & Borgford-Parnell, Strengthening Ambition for Climate Mitigation: The Role of the Montreal Protocol in Reducing Short-lived Climate Pollutants, in the Review of European Community & International Environmental Law. IGSD’s fast-action strategies can be started in two to three years, substantially implemented in five years in developed countries, and ten years in developing countries, and can produce a response in the climate system on a timescale of decades, to complement cuts in CO2, which operate on a longer timescale.  They also include measures to capture, reuse, and / or store CO2 after it is emitted, including biosequestration and strategies to turn biomass into more stable forms of carbon for long-term storage. In 2012, IGSD was elected to serve as the NGO representative on the Coalition's Steering Committee.

It was founded in 1988 and is an independent registered charity.[2] IPPR has offices in Newcastle, Manchester, and Edinburgh.[3][4] Funding comes from trust and foundation grants, government support, and individual donors.[5] The think tank aims to maintain the momentum of progressive thought in the United Kingdom through well-researched and clearly argued policy analysis, reports, and publications; as well as a high media profile.[6] Contents 1 History 2 Publications 2.1 Journal 2.2 Reports 3 Funding 4 References History[edit] The Institute for Public Policy Research was founded in 1988 by Lord Hollick and Lord Eatwell.[7] The founding director was James Cornford[8] and Tessa Blackstone was the first chair.[7] According to academic Peter Ruben its primary aim was to provide theoretical analysis for modernisers in the UK Labour Party; offering alternatives to free market fundamentalism.[9] In 1992 IPPR published the highly influential report of the Commission on Social Justice, laying out out an ambitious agenda of social policy reform and revitalise progressive thinking as New Labour became ascendant.[7] IPPR North was launched in 2004 with an office opening in Newcastle;[10] a second office was opened in Manchester in 2012.[11] Matthew Taylor was director between 1998 and 2003. Tom Kibasi was the group's director between April 2016 and December 2019.[12] Carys Roberts became Executive Director of IPPR in February 2020.[13] Publications[edit] IPPR publishes about fifty reports each year, topics include economic policy, energy, transport, climate change, families, work, migration, integration, communities, democracy, devolution and public services.[14] Journal[edit] IPPR Progressive ReviewDisciplinePoliticsLanguageEnglishEdited byJoshua Emden, Shreya Nanda, Rachel Statham and Chris ThomasPublication detailsFormer name(s)New EconomyPublic Policy ResearchJunctureHistory1994–presentPublisherWiley (United Kingdom)Standard abbreviationsISO 4 (alt) · Bluebook (alt1 · alt2)NLM (alt) · MathSciNet (alt )ISO 4IPPR Progress.

The report recommendations included; the minimum wage raised to £10.20 per hour in London and to £8.75 outside London, workers on zero hours contracts to be paid at least 20% above the higher rate, an industrial strategy boosting exports, with a new national investment bank raising £15bn a year to get public investment to 3.5% of GDP (the G7 average), large changes to government of UK companies including workers on company boards, raising the headline rate of corporation tax and a minimum corporation tax rate to fight tax avoidance by multinationals and a single income tax for all types of incomes. Currently the poorest 20% pay 35% of their incomes in tax, a higher proportion than any other income groups.[16][17][18] Prosperity and justice: A plan for the new economy - The final report of the IPPR Commission on Economic Justice, Tom Kibasi, Michael Jacobs, Catherine Colebrook, Mathew Lawrence, Carys Roberts, Grace Blakeley, Laurie Laybourn-Langton, Lesley Rankin, Alfie Stirling (September 2018) Polity Press[19] The IPPR published the ""State of the North 2019"" report, from IPPR North, which blames power centralisation and lack of devolution for adding to regional divisions. The report showed that the UK has larger regional divisions than any other country at a comparable level of economic development. The mortality rate in Blackpool, Hull and Manchester is higher than in some Turkish and Polish cities. Luke Raikes of the IPPR North, said, “It is no surprise that people across the country feel so disempowered. Both political and economic power are hoarded by a handful of people in London and the south-east and this has damaged all parts of the country, from Newcastle to Newham.” There are also bigger divides in job opportunities and productivity than in comparable nations. Areas in London and the South East rank among the most productive in the developed world, but areas in Northern Ireland, Wales and the North of England are less productive than areas in Hungary, Poland and Romania. The report authors maintain centralisation created and worsened these regional divisions and point out that 95p in every £1 paid in tax goes to Whitehall, compared with 69p in Germany. UK local government spends 1% of GDP on economic affairs while France and Germany spend twice as much locally and regionally. The UK is, “consistently more divided than any comparable country” over vital topics like productivity, income, unemployment, health and politics. Economists believe productivity is vital for economic growth and increasing living standards, there the UK is the most regionally divided nation of its size and development level and during the last decade has not improved. Regional inequality of inome has increased over the years to 2019, reaching an average £48,000 per person difference between the most prosperous and the most deprived areas. Arianna Giovannini of IPPR North, said 2019 had, “exposed our country’s regional divides (...) But 2019 also showed the great promise of devolution. Mayors in the north have shown what’s possible, despite the limited amount of devolved power they currently have. Devolution must be the way forward for the country, and all areas need substantial power and funding. The next government must lead a devolution parliament – an unprecedented and irreversible shift of power – so that England’s regions, towns and cities can work together to bridge our regional divides.”[20][21] Funding[edit] IPPR has been rated as 'broadly transparent' in its funding by Transparify[22] and has been a given a B grade for funding transparency by Who Funds You?[23] References[edit] ^ Redding, Emily (2020-09-15).

255,"Institute for Transportation and Development Policy - Wikipedia Institute for Transportation and Development Policy From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Promoting Sustainable and Equitable Transportation Worldwide.Founder(s)Michael ReplogleEstablished1985Exec. DirectorClayton LaneAddress9 E. 19th St. New York, NYLocationNew York, NY, US (Headquarters)Websitewww.itdp.org The Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP) is a non-governmental non-profit organization that focuses on developing bus rapid transit (BRT) systems, promoting biking, walking, and non-motorized transport, and improving private bus operators margins.[1] Other programs include parking reform, traffic demand management, and global climate and transport policy. According to its mission statement, ITDP is committed to ""promoting sustainable and equitable transportation worldwide.""[2] In addition to its role supporting and consulting local governmental efforts to develop more sustainable transportation, ITDP publishes the magazine Sustainable Transport annually, produces the BRT Standard and other research, and sits on the committee for the annual Sustainable Transport Award. Contents 1 Overview 2 Key areas of operation 2.1 Public transport 2.2 Cycling and walking 2.3 Sustainable urban development 2.4 International sustainable transport policy 3 See also 4 References 5 External links Overview[edit] ITDP was founded in 1985 by Michael Replogle and other sustainable transport advocates in the United States to counteract the spread of costly and environmentally damaging car-centric urban development models, and to promote biking, walking, and public transit in transportation planning.[3][4][5] In its first ten years, ITDP worked to support and grow local bicycle industries in Haiti, Nicaragua, Mozambique, South Africa, and West Africa. By 1989, ITDP's Bikes Not Bombs campaign had shipped 10,000 second-hand bicycles to support health and education efforts in Nicaragua and used these to establish a bicycle assembly industry in that country. ITDP advocated for the redirection of lending activity by the World Bank and other multi-lateral institutions. Where these global institutions had an exclusive focus on road projects, ITDP worked to open up funding for multi-modal transport solutions.[5] ITDP advocated for sustainable transport initiatives in U.S. transportation policy, influencing the 1991 Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA). Responding to ITDP pressure, the Peace Corps put its volunteers on bicycles rather than motorcycles. In the early nineties, ITDP helped establish the Transport Sector Task Force, an advisory panel to the US Treasury Department's Multi-lateral Development Bank liaison office, to comment on specific transport projects. In its 1994 study ""Counting on Cars, Counting Out People"" ITDP published a preliminary set of guidelines for reforming the World Bank Transport Sector economic appraisal to make it less biased in favor of motorways. The report's key recommendation that economic impacts on non-motorized road users be included in the appraisal has been incorporated into World Bank practice.[6] ITDP has offices in seven countries, with projects and relationships in over 100 cities worldwide.[7] In 2009, former mayor of Bogotá, Colombia Enrique Peñalosa, who was instrumental in the establishment of that city's TransMilenio BRT system, was elected as President of the Board of Directors of ITDP.[8][9] Walter B. Hook served as the organizations executive director from 1993 to 2014. Heather Thompson is ITDP's interim CEO. Key areas of operation[edit] Public transport[edit] A TransJakarta bus serving Corridor 2 (Harmoni-Pulo Gadung). ITDP works to encourage safe, modern, and efficient public transportation systems in cities worldwide. ITDP is currently active in a design and/or consulting capacity in the BRT programs of Ahmedabad, India; Dar es Salaam, Tanzania; Johannesburg, South Africa (Rea Vaya); Jakarta, Indonesia (TransJakarta); Guangzhou, Lanzhou, and Yichang, China; Mexico City, Mexico, Buenos Aires, Argentina, and more.[10] In June 2007, ITDP published the Bus Rapid Transit Planning Guide along with the United Nations Environment Programme, the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ), the Hewlett Foundation, and Viva. The guide draws from the extensive BRT design experience of Latin American transit planners, and aims to disseminate this information in the US and other countries around the world.[11] The guide is currently available in English, Spanish, Portuguese, and Chinese, and is free for download in .pdf format from the ITDP website.[11] In addition, ITDP developed the BRT Standard, a design guide and rating system for Bus Rapid Transit systems around the world. The Standard establishes a common definition for BRT and identifies BRT best practices, as well as functioning as a scoring system to allow BRT corridors to be evaluated and recognized for their superior design and management aspects. It uses a systematic method of evaluating BRT systems, rating their quality as ""gold, silver, or bronze"". Some systems that had been branded as BRT failed to meet even minimal standards distinguishing BRT from regular urban bus service. A related report on BRT in the US[12] noted that ""Some American systems reviewed had so few essential characteristics that calling them a BRT system at all does a disservice to efforts to gain broader adoption of BRT in the United States...These systems, with relatively few BRT characteristics, have helped confuse the American public about what exactly constitutes BRT.""[12]:34 Cycling and walking[edit] ITDP encourages urban design that prioritizes human-powered forms of transportation, such as walking, cycling, and the use of rickshaws. Specifically, ITDP often works with cities to encourage car-free days and bike share programs, create safe streets for pedestrians and cyclists, and provide high-quality bicycles.[13] A modernized cycle rickshaw in Vrindavan, India In December 2013 the ITDP published the Bike-Share Planning Guide with the aim ""to bridge the divide between developing and developed countries’ experiences with bike-share."" The guide is expected to be useful for planning and implementing a bike sharing system regardless of the location, size, or density of the city. The guide is currently available only in English and is free for download in .pdf format from the ITDP website.[14] ITDP works with local governments on the expansion and design of bike lanes, and pedestrian networks throughout the city. In São Paulo, Brazil ITDP assisted in the design of a pilot bicycle path in the neighborhood of Butantã. For the project, ITDP commissioned a report for a 58 kilometer feeder network, which will lead cyclists from adjacent streets and sidewalks to the bicycle path. The path will pass through a high-visibility corridor of the city, and if successfully implemented could be expanded to surrounding neighborhoods and throughout the city.[15] Past projects have included a redesign of India's traditional cycle rickshaw in collaboration with local experts, reducing the weight of the vehicles by 30% and adding a multi-gear system to increase efficiency; increasing Africa's cycling capacity while bolstering local industry through the establishment of the California Bike Coalition (CBC); and traffic impact and mitigation analysis along with outreach to local interest groups in the pedestrianization of Malioboro Road in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.[16][17][18][19] Sustainable urban development[edit] ITDP works to integrate transport and smart urban design to help remake cities and suburbs into livable spaces that foster economic opportunities, encourage low carbon lifestyles, and attract residents. This is done through designing environments for cycling and walking, fostering the development of pedestrian and transit based real estate development, and creating policies that help turn cultural and physical spaces into economic assets.[20] In November 2013 ITDP published ""The TOD Standard"" which elaborates in eight key principles for guiding the implementation of transit-oriented development (TOD). The guide is available for download in .pdf format from the ITDP website.[21] ITDP has initiated advised on a number of projects in cities around the world. ITDP worked with the Mexico City government to provide technical support for the revitalization of Mexico City's Historic Center. ITDP managed the planning and implementation efforts of the revitalization, in addition to promoting street maintenance and cleanliness, supplementation of public security, and the management and controlling of parking and street vending activity in the area. ITDP claims that this reorientation of the Historic Center towards pedestrian and transit oriented development will reverse decades of deterioration, attract tourism and investment, and improve air quality in the notoriously polluted city. Additionally, ITDP participated as part of the team developing Mexico City’s Bicycle Master Plan to design routes that connect to the Historic Center, further integrating multi-modal development of the area.[22] International sustainable transport policy[edit] ITDP co-founded the Partnership on Sustainable Low Carbon Transport (SLoCaT) in 2009 and through that helped secure in 2012 a $175 billion 10-year commitment from the world's largest multilateral development banks to support sustainable transport, with annual reporting and monitoring. Working with SLoCaT, ITDP helped mainstream sustainable transport strategies in the United Nations' post-2015 development agenda and in discussions of climate change mitigation strategies in the run-up to the 2015 global climate summit in Paris (COP-15). With the University of California Davis, ITDP in 2014 published, A Global High Shift Scenario: Impacts and Potential for More Public Transport, Walking, and Cycling With Lower Car Use, showing how a shift in transport funding to support alternatives to more driving could save over $100 trillion cumulatively for consumers and governments by 2050 while cutting cumulative climate change pollution from urban transport by 25% and improving equity of access to opportunities for the poor.

That is one of the key takeaways of a landmark report from the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released on Monday.Authored by 234 scientists in 66 countries, the first chapter of the IPCC’s sixth assessment report also said it was “more likely than not” that the world will hit 1.5C of global warming sometime between 2021 and 2040. Urgent and immediate action is needed to keep aspirations to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels within reach.The milestone report comes shortly before Cop26, a global climate summit taking place in Glasgow in November. The findings will provide the backdrop for discussions on how best to tackle the climate crisis at the key meeting of global leaders.Beyond this, the landmark assessment will also inform the work of scientists studying changes to Earth’s climate in the years ahead.Below, The Independent has gathered the thoughts of 12 scientists on what they view to be the main messages contained within the report’s 3,000 pages.RecommendedIPCC report – live: UN report warns time running out to save planet10 key takeaways from the IPCC’s landmark climate report1.5C goal slipping beyond reach, warns IPCC climate report Prof Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist at The Nature ConservancyThese latest IPCC conclusions couldn’t speak any louder. It’s clear we’re all in the same boat – facing a challenge that will affect every one of us within our lifetimes, not to mention future generations and most other life on Earth. The need to act collectively and decisively has never been more urgent.Scientists have predicted the likelihood of accelerating climate change for more than a century now – yet too often their warnings have been disregarded. My hope is that the rigour, transparency, and unprecedented urgency of this latest IPCC report will make it simply impossible to ignore.Prof Simon Lewis, global change scientist, University College London and the University of LeedsThe very careful scientific language of the new report contains a stark message: the level of devastation we face is in our collective hands. If the world slashes CO2 emissions now and reduces them to net zero by 2050 we would keep the global temperature rise close to 1.5C and avoid the worst impacts.Cutting emissions to net zero means keeping fossil fuels in the ground, ending deforestation, and rapidly moving to using renewable energy to power the global economy.The new report significantly raises the pressure on world leaders to agree detailed and achievable plans to immediately cut emissions when they meet for the UN climate summit in Glasgow in November.Dr Ella Gilbert, post-doctoral research assistant at the University of ReadingClimate change is happening before our very eyes. Recent events across the world only emphasise that – from devastating wildfires in California, Greece and Turkey, to floods in England, Belgium and Germany, to heatwaves in Siberia and Canada. This report reminds us of what we already know – that these kinds of events will only become more frequent and hard-hitting with ongoing warming.The science should come as no surprise – but it serves as a stark warning. As the report says – “every tonne of CO2 emissions adds to global warming” – so what we do now has never been more important.Prof Petteri Taalas, secretary-general of the UN’s World Meteorological OrganisationThe harsh reality of climate change is playing out in real time before our very eyes.It is a foretaste of what faces future generations. Some of the negative changes are already locked into the climate system but others still can be addressed if we make strong, rapid and sustained reductions in emissions now.✕5 key takeaways from the IPCC’s landmark climate reportDr Shilpi Srivastava, research fellow at the Institute of Development Studies at the University of SussexThe findings should serve as a reminder that we need to urgently prioritise support for those who are most disadvantaged and already experiencing the worst impacts of climate change.We need transformative climate justice for people across the globe who’ve been marginalised and excluded from decision-making on impacts and interventions. We need to talk about loss and damage for vulnerable communities and must hold governments accountable to deliver programmes that bring meaningful and positive change in the lives of those most affected by climate change.Leaders meeting at Cop26 need to listen to science and take decisive actions to keep fossil fuels in the ground. In parallel, they must ensure that policies for adaptation and mitigation, including achieving net zero emissions are just and inclusive.Prof Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development in BangladeshThe just published seminal sixth assessment report of the IPCC should be termed the “Loss and Damage” report because it will usher in the new era of Loss and Damage from human induced climate change! The worst impacts are still avoidable by urgent actions by all countries before Cop26. (On Twitter.)Dr Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick, climate extremes fellow at the University of New South Wales, SydneyThe latest IPCC report underlines that climate change is happening now, and will continue to get worse if drastic cuts to emissions are not undertaken.The world has warmed by almost 1.1C and Australia by 1.4C. With this change, we have seen increases in the frequency and severity of heatwaves, more severe bushfires, more intense rainfall events, and more droughts over some regions. Compound extreme events, which occur at the same time, have also increased.Many of these changes scale with global warming – the more global warming we experience, the worse these extremes will be.Prof Dave Reay, director of Edinburgh Climate Change Institute, University of EdinburghThis report should send a shiver down the spine of everyone who reads it. In the unblinking delivery style of the IPCC it sets out where we are now and where we are headed and climate change: in a hole, and still digging.Extreme temperatures, and the loading of the heat wave dice our emissions are causing, get deserved attention. A searing “one-in-50 year event” of the past for instance, is already more than four times more likely and, under a high emissions future, could become around 40 times more likely, and five degrees hotter to boot.What really stands out are the new assessments of tipping points in our global climate system, and the climate change lock-ins we are forging for scores of generations to come. For the tipping points – things like massive die-back of the forests and belching of carbon from thawing soils – it’s clear that every extra tonne of CO2 emitted today is pushing us into a minefield of feedback effects tomorrow.Dr Michael E Mann, distinguished professor of atmospheric science at Pennsylvania State UniversityIdeologically-motivated science denial is, as we’ve seen, deadly when it comes to Covid 19.And, as we’ve seen, when it comes to the climate crisis. (On Twitter.)Prof Martin Siegert, co-director of the Grantham Institute at Imperial College LondonOn sea level rise, the [report] is a much better reflection of the state of knowledge than previous [IPCC assessment reports] that have tended to underestimate, or even ignore, the highest possible outcomes.There are great uncertainties in ice-sheet processes (the dominant contributor in future), and this lack of knowledge and the consequences for sea level projections – coupled with an appreciation of how ice sheets can change rapidly from palaeo studies – is reflected explicitly and properly.Dr Andrew King, a lecturer in climate science at the University of MelbourneThe sixth IPCC assessment report provides a comprehensive review of the state of Earth’s climate and the possible futures that lie ahead. There is increased confidence around many key statements, but the central message remains the same as before: Our use of fossil fuels has caused the climate to warm and if we don’t drastically reduce our greenhouse gas emissions we risk a much warmer world and worse climate change impacts.This report includes an increased focus on climate extremes as the science around climate change and high-impact events has grown. For example, the burgeoning area of event attribution, in which the role of human-caused climate change on extreme events may be examined, is used to show that some recent hot extremes would have been extremely unlikely to occur without human influences on the climate.Prof Mark Maslin, earth system scientist at University College LondonThis report is a scientific and political wake-up call for all governments of the world to take climate change seriously. It acts as a reminder of the urgency of the climate crisis and warns.Governments must now work in solidarity, taking heed of this report and increasing their ambitions to ensure we can avoid the worst effects of climate change, adapt to its impacts, and protect our most vulnerable populations. The IPCC report gives governments the essential tools to rapidly adapt to climate change and shows emission pathways needed to limit climate change.More aboutScientistsIPCCClimateCop26 Join our new commenting forumJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesView comments 1/1How scientists around the world reacted to the IPCC climate report How scientists around the world reacted to the IPCC climate reportThe role that humans have played in driving the climate crisis is ‘unequivocal’, said the landmark reportGetty ✕Subscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this articleWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The program involves a combination of international research seminars, high-level policy conferences and commissioned working papers on a central theme of importance to international energy policy. It is hoped that the program, by bringing together senior policy makers and scholars from a variety of important countries from around the world, will promote enhanced discussion and cooperation on international energy policy.

With the diversification of social needs during the three and a half decades of its operation, IEEJ has expanded its scope of research activities to include such topics as environmental problems and international cooperation closely related to energy. The Energy Data and Modeling Center (EDMC), which merged with the IEEJ in July 1999, was established in October 1984 as an IEEJ-affiliated organization to carry out such tasks as the development of energy data bases, the building of various energy models and the econometric analyses of energy. Previous Research: JPEC In past years, the Energy Forum collaborated with the Japan Petroleum Energy Center (JPEC) to publish five joint studies on energy policy and energy science and technology policy. The studies covered Japanese energy policy; micro-nuclear technology; emerging technologies in the natural gas sector; and Persian Gulf politics and oil, post-September 11, and Energy In Russia. There was further collaboration on a major study on the ""Role of National Oil Companies"" which was finalized in 2007. JPEC was established in May 1986 by the petroleum subcommittee in the Petroleum Council, which is an advisory committee to the Minister of International Trade and Industry. JPEC's mission is to promote structural renovation that will effectively enhance technological development in the petroleum industry and to cope with the need for the rationalization of the refining system. JPEC's international collaborations cover joint research and exchange of researchers and information with oil producing countries and international institutions and support for infrastructure improvement and solving environmental problems of the petroleum industries in oil producing countries.

Geographical coverage Western Europe, Eastern Europe Name of lead organisation Global Investor Coalition on Climate Change (GIC) Type of lead organisation Network/Consortium/Partnership Location/Nationality of lead organisation United Kingdom Description Description The Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) is a forum for collaboration on climate change for investors. Objectives IIGCC provides investors with a collaborative platform to encourage public policies, investment practices, and corporate behavior that address long-term risks and opportunities associated with climate change. IIGCC pursues its mission through two strategic objectives: 1. Changing market signals by encouraging the adoption of strong and credible public policy solutions that ensure an orderly and efficient move to a low carbon economy, as well as measures for adaptation. 2. Informing investment practices to preserve and enhance long-term investment values. Activities To deliver on its objectives, IIGCC operates a number of programmes that commission research, produce reports and engage with various stakeholders. These are some of the planned and on-going projects in each of IIGCCs main focus areas: 1. Policy The mission of IIGCCs Policy programme is to develop and communicate investor positions on policy and regulatory frameworks at international, regional and national level to support a shift in favour of less carbon-intensive investment. 2. Climate Risk The aim of IIGCCs Climate Risk programme is to help investors identify, and to the extent possible, quantify the strategic implications of policy measures and physical risks to long-term investments with a view to inform communication with other stakeholders. 3. Corporate The mission of IIGCCs Corporate programme is to deepen investor understanding of the nature of risks and opportunities faced by companies, as well as their strategies and performance in addressing them. There is also a special focus on company views on climate change policy. 4. Property IIGCCs Property programme has two principal aims: The first is to engage with policymakers to ensure appropriate policies are put in place which maximise environmental benefits whilst maintaining and enhancing property investment returns. The second aim is to ensure that considerations of climate change and its implications are integrated into the management and decision-making process for property investment portfolios. 5. Global IIGCC collaborates with regional investor networks and others. The Global Investor Coalition on Climate Change is a collaboration between IIGCC, INCR, IGCC and AIGCC for shared international initiatives on climate policy and other projects of common interest.

The organizational score represents the degree to which the organization influencing climate policy and legislation. Corporations also have relationship scores reflecting their links with influencers like trade associations. Both are combined to place the corporation in a performance band. Full details can be found here. close D+ Performance Band 52% Organisation Score 2% Engagement Intensity Engagement Intensity The engagement intensity (EI) is a metric of the extent to which the company is engaging on climate change policy matters, whether positively or negatively. It is a number from 0 (no engagement at all) to 100 (full engagement on all queries/data points). Clearly energy companies are more affected by climate regulations and will have a higher EI than, for example retailers. So an organization’s score should be looked at in conjunction with this metric to gauge the amount of evidence we are using in each case as a basis for scoring. On our scale, an EI of more than 35 indicates a relatively large amount of climate policy engagement. close Modifications to InfluenceMap Scoring Relationship Score, December 2020 A new batch of industry associations has been uploaded onto the InfluenceMap system and the relationship scores recalculated accordingly. Updated terminology, February 2021 We adjusted the terminology used to describe the queries running down the left-hand side of our scoring matrix and added additional explanatory text to the info-boxes. This has no impact on the scores and methodology. It has been done following user feedback to improve clarity. close Sector: Financials Head​quarters: London, United Kingdom Official Web Site: www.iigcc.org Wikipedia: Details of Organization Score What do the 0,1,2 and NSs, NAs mean? Each cell in the organization's matrix presents a chance for us to assess each data source against our column of climate change policy queries. We score from -2 to 2, with negative scores representing evidence of obstructive influence. ""NA"" means ""not applicable"" and ""NS"" means ""not scored"" - that is we did not find any evidence either way. In both cases, the cell's weighting is re-distributed over others. Red and blue cells represent highly interesting negative or positive influence respectively. Full details can be found here. close QUERIES DATA SOURCES Main Web Site The main organizational Web site of the company and its direct links to major affiliates and attached documents. Social Media We search other media and sites funded or controlled by the organization, such as social media (Twitter, Facebook) and direct advertising campaigns of the organization. CDP Responses We assess and score responses to two questions from CDP's climate change information request (12.3 a & 12.3c) related to political influence questions (currently these are not numerically scored by the CDP process). Legislative Consultations Comments from the entity being scored on governmental regulatory consultation processes, including those obtained by InfluenceMap through Freedom of Information requests.

View all members Become a member Environmental, social and governance considerations sit at the heart of our business. In putting the investor perspective on climate change on the European and global agenda, IIGCC has been a pioneer in the sustainable finance space for many years. Being able to contribute as a member in continuing to move the sector forward is an important way for BNP Paribas Asset Management to demonstrate that we put our values into practice. Frederic Janbon - CEO, BNP Paribas Asset Management Climate change is the biggest challenge the world currently faces, affecting all countries and sectors of the global economy. It is vital that investors, as stewards of global capital, play a leading role in supporting the transition to a low-emission and climate-resilient future. We support IIGCC’s efforts in driving this crucial agenda forward and encourage all investors to ensure they are actively contributing to the transformation we need to achieve. Patricia Espinosa - Executive Secretary, UN Climate Change For Elo, IIGCC membership enhances our ability to analyse climate risk as well as strengthen our engagement with companies and policy-makers. Given IIGCC’s members consist of market leaders on sustainable investment, there is also mutual benefit in sharing new ideas and collaborating on such a vital topic. Hanna Hiidenpalo - CIO, Elo At Generation we think deeply about climate risk and ways in which sustainability measures could affect long-term value creation. As many of IIGCC’s members are leaders in the field, it is mutually advantageous to collaborate and share knowledge in this area to accelerate the transition to a more sustainable form of capitalism. David Blood - President and co-founder, Generation Investment Management Addressing climate change with responsible investment goes hand in hand with good financial performance for us. As a meeting point for leading investors, IIGCC enables participants to engage with companies and policy-makers to debate and influence how we invest for a prosperous, low-carbon future. Peter Branner - CIO, APG Asset Management We are members of IIGCC because it is recognised as a leading organisation for expertise and actions supporting the integration of climate change into decision making. Informed IIGCC engagement work also complements other initiatives helping investors drive the transition to a low carbon economy, like the Transition Pathway Initiative. Emma Howard Boyd - Chair of the Environment Agency Pension Fund Investment Committee and Chair of the Environment Agency As a board member of the two largest U.S. public pension funds, I value IIGCC’s work in organising European investors to engage with their portfolio companies on the urgent need for climate risk disclosure. With the powerful collaboration of the Climate Action 100+ initiative, investors can gain valuable insight into how well companies have aligned their business strategies to meet the 2-degrees goal.

Organisational structure The four regional groups collaborate in a consensus decision making approach. Each regional group will be represented by their senior executive. By forming a coalition, the regional investor groups have a platform to conduct international activities on climate policy and investment practice. As the regional groups have similar objectives, work programmes and membership, a global platform enables more information sharing and common projects to better serve members. Geographical coverage Global Name of lead organisation Type of lead organisation Location/Nationality of lead organisation Description Description The Global Investor Coalition on Climate Change is a joint initiative of four regional climate change investor groups: IIGCC (Europe), INCR (North America), IGCC (Australia & New Zealand) and AIGCC (Asia). The coalition has come together to provide a global platform for dialogue between and amongst investors and governments on international policy and investment practice related to climate change. The four investor groups that make up the Global Investor Coalition on Climate Change have agreed to partner on global carbon policy initiatives, agreements and projects to deliver better investor and climate outcomes. The GIC regional investor networks collaborate on joint international projects focused on climate policy, corporate engagement and investment practices, including investor statements on climate change. The GIC collaborates and coordinates investor engagement on climate change issues with key international organizations and institutions including the United Nations, the G20, OECD, the World Bank, IFC, regional development banks and a number of NGOs. The GIC has launched several joint projects and statements to date. Objectives Activities ■ Work with policy makers to support and inform their efforts to develop and implement policy measures that encourage capital deployment at scale to finance the transition to a low carbon economy and encourage investment in climate change adaptation. ■ Identify and evaluate low carbon investment opportunities that meet GICs investment criteria and consider investment vehicles that invest in low carbon assets subject to our risk and return objectives. ■ Develop GICs capacity to assess the risks and opportunities presented by climate change and climate policy to our investment portfolios, and integrate, where appropriate, this information into our investment decisions. ■ Work with the companies in which GICs invests to ensure that they are minimising and disclosing the risks and maximising the opportunities presented by climate change and climate policy. ■ Continue to report on the actions GIC has taken and the progress we have made in addressing climate risk and investing in areas such as renewable energy, energy efficiency and climate change adaptation Projects: Low Carbon Investment Registry Investor Platform on Climate Actions Visit the projects page for more information: http://globalinvestorcoalition.org/projects/ One or two success stories achieved Monitoring and Impacts Function of initiative Technical dialogue, Political dialogue Activity of initiative Knowledge dissemination and exchange, Awareness raising and outreach, Knowledge production and innovation Indicators Goals Comments on indicators and goals How will goals be achieved Have you changed or strenghtened your goals Progress towards the goals How are you tracking progress of your initiative Available reporting Participants Participants Number Names Members 413 Companies 409 Investors signed the Global Investor Statement on Climate Change (2014-2015) Business organisations 0 Research and educational organisations 0 Non-governmental organisations 4 GIC is a joint initiative of four regional groups that represent investors on climate change and the transition to a low carbon economy: IIGCC (Europe),  INCR (North America),  IGCC (Australia & New Zealand) and AIGCC (Asia) National states 0 Governmental actors 0 Regional / state / county actors 0 City / municipal actors 0 Intergovernmental organisations 0 Financial Institutions 0 Faith based organisations 0 Other members 0 Supporting partners 0 Number of members in the years 2018413 Have only national states as participators No Theme Transport Agriculture Forestry Business Financial institutions Buildings Industry Waste Cities and subnational governments Short Term Pollutants International maritime transport Energy Supply Fluorinated gases Energy efficiency Renewable energy Supply chain emission reductions Adaptation Other Resilience Innovation Energy Access and Efficiency Private Finance No No No No Yes No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No Last update: 10 September 2018 14:35:34 Not only have national states as participators Retrieved from ""http://climateinitiativesplatform.org/index.php?title=Global_Investor_Coalition_on_Climate_Change_(GIC)&oldid=15872"" Category: Climate initiative Disclaimers Log In",Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change Ltd.
