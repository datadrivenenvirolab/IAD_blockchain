The Society for Threatened Peoples International STPI (German: Gesellschaft für bedrohte Völker-International, GfbV-International) is an international NGO and human rights organization with its headquarters in Göttingen, Germany. Its aim is to create awareness of and protect minority peoples around the world who are threatened by oppressive governments. The society states that it ""campaigns against all forms of genocide and ethnocide."" It has consultative status with the United Nations, participatory status with the Council of Europe, and has branches in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Iraqi Kurdistan. The Secretary General of the Society for Threatened Peoples International (STPI) and Society for Threatened Peoples-Germany (STP) is Tilman Zülch.[1] The society awards the Victor Gollancz Prize. The Society for Threatened Peoples has a strong focus on Eastern Europe and other parts of Eurasia, including Russia and the Balkans, but it also works with countries in Africa and the Middle East. Contents 1 History 2 Organization and areas of work 3 Political goals and strategies 4 References 5 External links History[edit] The Society for Threatened Peoples Germany emerged in 1970 from the Hamburg-based ""Aktion Biafra-Hilfe."" Aktion Biafra-Hilfe was founded in June 1968 by Tilman Zülch and Klaus Guerke during the Biafra War to draw attention of the world to the occurrences within Biafra in present-day Nigeria and to stop the hunger and genocide going on there.[citation needed] Zülch went to the area to witness the atrocities and eventually wrote a book together with Klaus Guerke.[citation needed] The experience campaigning for the protection of the victims and refugees encouraged campaigns for other minorities transforming Aktion Biafra-Hilfe into the Society for Threatened Peoples-Germany.[citation needed] In 1978 the headquarters of the Society for Threatened Peoples Germany moved from Hamburg to Göttingen. Since 1993 the STP has consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. The STPI is also a Member organization of Committee for a Democratic UN. Since January 2005 the STPI also has participatory status at the Council of Europe. Organization and areas of work[edit] The STPI is one of several European minority rights organizations. In December 2011, the organization had 5774 members and 675 sponsors, most of whom are based in Germany. The organization's activities are coordinated in Göttingen. Regional groups support the work of the STP-Germany in a few German cities, including Berlin, Hamburg, Munich, Münster and Nuremberg. The STPI publishes press releases, organizes public demonstrations, arranges post card fund raising campaigns, prepares reports for court hearings,[citation needed] produces educational materials for teachers,[citation needed] and publishes the journal ""Pogrom"", which is a source of information about the situation of ethnic and religious minorities. Since its founding, a main focus of the human rights work of the STP, has been the African continent;[citation needed] though the STPI is not represented by a section. Since the Yugoslav wars the STPI has been disproportionately active in Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as Kosovo. In Kosovo the STP-Germany paid for a team that, under the direction of the human rights worker Paul Polansky, worked for the interests of the Roma. In Bosnia and Herzegovina the support of the survivors of the Srebrenica Massacre is particularly important for the German chapter of the STPI. Another focus of the STPI is indigenous peoples. Renate Domnick, a volunteer for the STP-Germany, organized the first large European trip of an Indian delegation from 16 American countries. In the Middle East the Kurds play an important role for the STP: This pushed the STP-Germany to open a STPI office in the Kurdish area of northern Iraq.[citation needed] Prominent supporters of STP-Germany include: the writer and futurologist Robert Jungk,[citation needed], the author Günter Grass,[citation needed] former German chancellor Willy Brandt,[citation needed] current President of East Timor José Ramos-Horta, and Marek Edelman a leader in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising.[2] Political goals and strategies[edit] The Society for Threatened Peoples places the fight against genocide, forced migration, racism, all forms of minority oppression, and deportation of refugees in their country of origin as the center of their work. Their themes include the cultural and religious groupings like the Falun Gong in China, the Christian minorities in Iran, or ethnic groups like the Roma or Chechen. The Society for Threatened Peoples lobbies politicians and uses letter writing campaigns to apply pressure for its causes. The Society for Threatened Peoples has always maintained that forced migration, today often known as ethnic cleansing, of people is wrong and constitute a crime. The Society for Threatened Peoples has advocated for a Centre against Expulsions.[3] The Society for Threatened Peoples has in special situations supported military interventions. The society supported the NATO intervention in the Kosovo War in 1999. In 2006 the Society for Threatened Peoples supported the protection of elections in the Congo by the German military.

(October 2018) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Dengel receives an honorary doctorate (Nijmegen, 1958) English Logo of the Medical Mission Sisters The Medical Mission Sisters (MMS) are a religious congregation of women in the Roman Catholic Church founded in 1925 and dedicated to providing the poor of the world better access to health care. They were formerly officially known as the ""Society of the Catholic Medical Missions"". Contents 1 History 2 Music 3 Beginnings of international hospitals 4 Current status 5 See also 6 References History[edit] The congregation grew out of the experiences of Dr. Anna Dengel, a native of Austria. Dr. Dengel had served for several years as a medical missionary to the poor of what was then Northern India and today is the nation of Pakistan. She had experienced firsthand the unnecessary sickness and death of countless Muslim women and children, whose customs kept them cut off from medical care administered by male physicians. After months of traveling to give talks about the conditions in India, and speaking with many members of the clergy, Dr. Dengel became convinced that only a group of Religious Sisters who had been professionally trained as physicians could reach these women, who were cut off from adequate medical care by cultural and religious traditions. Such a project, however, was contrary to canon law of the time, which prohibited members of religious institutes from practicing medicine. Nevertheless, she drew up a Constitution for the Community she had in mind and wrote that the members were “to live for God...to dedicate themselves to the service of the sick for the love of God and ...to be properly trained according to the knowledge and standards of the time in order to practice medicine in its full scope, to which the Sisters were to dedicate their lives.” Permission was granted on June 12, 1925, to begin the new Congregation and, on September 30, 1925, the “First Four”—Dr. Anna Dengel of Austria, Dr. Johanna Lyons of Chicago, Evelyn Flieger, R.N., originally from Britain, and Marie Ulbrich, R.N., of Luxemburg, Iowa—came together in Washington, D.C., to begin the Medical Mission Sisters. The “First Four” were unable to profess religious vows officially because the Catholic Church had yet to approve Sisters working in the medical field, yet they lived as professed Sisters just the same. Finally, in 1935, after the Medical Mission Sisters had grown, the Catholic Church changed its regulations and approved Sisters’ working in medicine and all of its branches. The Medical Mission Sisters then made their public, canonical vows, and they began to establish communities around the world. Music[edit] The North American headquarters for the Congregation came to be established in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1964 when, like The Singing Nun (Soeur Sourire) had done a year earlier - the Sisters began singing their own homegrown brand of spiritually-themed folk music as an aide to the medical health and wellness they professed. In 1965 one of the most prolific of these composers, Sister Miriam Therese Winter had composed what would become a Grammy-award-winning worldwide hit Joy is Like the Rain.[1] Response was so strong to the song that other songs were written and a marathon eight-hour recording session was commissioned in Philadelphia in early 1966, at which this song was recorded along with dozens of others which would make up their first five albums.[citation needed] Beginnings of international hospitals[edit] In 1965, at the request of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Addis Ababa in Ethiopia, Mother Anna made a visit to that nation to investigate the possibilities of starting a hospital for the people of that nation. Two Medical Mission Sisters arrived in Ethiopia in 1967 to start the groundwork for this mission. A few more Sisters came in 1969, and their work was able to begin. As of 2008, there were a dozen Sisters serving there, both foreigners and native Ethiopians.[2] Current status[edit] As of 2010, there are about 600 Sisters in the congregation, serving in 17 nations around the globe. The four first Sisters of the Congregation were from three different nations. In keeping with this heritage of internationality among the ""First Four"", the Sisters in the Congregation today come from 23 nations. The Sisters serve in a wide variety of ways. Among them, through: health care and education; wholeness and wellness programs; the development of women; work for justice; worship and spirituality; and music and song. They also have 80 Associates, women and men of many nations who share their values and have committed themselves to live the mission of the Society, which is ""to be a healing presence at the heart of a wounded world."" As examples of the range of services the Sisters do in different countries: In India, the Sisters run the Center for Healing and Integration, to train the people low to get low-cost health care through natural resources. In Pasco County, Florida, they run a community-based program to connect the unemployed with potential employers. A Learning Center for Ecological Spirituality was established in Udenhout, the Netherlands.[3] Sr. Margaret McKenna runs a drug recover center.[4] Medical Mission Sisters have worked as course instructors since its inception at the Holy Cross - Centre for Christian Meditation and Spirituality in the Holy Cross Church in Frankfurt-Bornheim.[5][6] See also[edit] Anna Dengel Miriam Therese Winter Monika Hellwig References[edit] ^ Joy is Like the Rain ^ Ethiopian Catholic Church Archived 2011-05-21 at the Wayback Machine ^ Medical Mission Sisters website ^ Kolodziej, Maureen (2006).

We are committed to promote healing and wholeness in all aspects of life.History Medical Mission Sisters were founded in September 1925 in Washington, D.C., by a young Austrian doctor named Anna Dengel.  Working in what was then North India in the early 1920s, Anna witnessed first-hand the complications and deaths of countless Muslim women and babies during childbirth due to their customs which prohibited them from receiving certain aspects of medical care from men. Anna went to the U.S. to begin raising funds and awareness.  She had a vision that a group of women health professionals who dedicated their lives to God could make a difference in helping women have access to the health care they deserved.  She saw this not only as a work of charity, but also one of justice. After about a year of “Making the Cause Known”, Anna was joined by Dr. Joanna Lyons, Mary Evelyn Flieger, RN, and Agnes Marie Ulbrich, RN, and on September 30, 1925, the Medical Mission Sisters began.  Our headquarters were in Washington, D.C. until the late 1930s when we were invited by Cardinal Dennis Dougherty to Philadelphia.  Philadelphia remains our North American headquarters today.  Our international headquarters is in London, England. From its inception we have offered care and compassion to millions of individuals in the world.  As the times and the needs have evolved, so too has our focus in mission — from curative, to include preventative, promotive, community-based, and holistic health care.  We also advocate and work for the health of our Earth and for a just sharing of our world’s limited resources. In every ministry, each of us strives to be a healing presence in the community of life. Conscious that ""justice is essential to comprehensive healing, health and wellbeing,"" today we also address problems of widespread poverty, hunger and malnutrition, unemployment, illiteracy, inadequate housing and unsafe water supplies.  Anna Dengel recognized long ago the unjust and oppressive structures that deprived Muslim women of basic health care. In addition to our Canonical members who make life vows of poverty, chastity and obedience, we have had Associate members for almost 50 years.  These women and men share the mission of healing presence and commit themselves to live it purposefully in their individual areas of service and ways of life.

They were formerly officially known as the ""Society of the Catholic Medical Missions"". Contents 1 History 2 Music 3 Beginnings of international hospitals 4 Current status 5 See also 6 References History[edit] The congregation grew out of the experiences of Dr. Anna Dengel, a native of Austria. Dr. Dengel had served for several years as a medical missionary to the poor of what was then Northern India and today is the nation of Pakistan. She had experienced firsthand the unnecessary sickness and death of countless Muslim women and children, whose customs kept them cut off from medical care administered by male physicians. After months of traveling to give talks about the conditions in India, and speaking with many members of the clergy, Dr. Dengel became convinced that only a group of Religious Sisters who had been professionally trained as physicians could reach these women, who were cut off from adequate medical care by cultural and religious traditions. Such a project, however, was contrary to canon law of the time, which prohibited members of religious institutes from practicing medicine. Nevertheless, she drew up a Constitution for the Community she had in mind and wrote that the members were “to live for God...to dedicate themselves to the service of the sick for the love of God and ...to be properly trained according to the knowledge and standards of the time in order to practice medicine in its full scope, to which the Sisters were to dedicate their lives.” Permission was granted on June 12, 1925, to begin the new Congregation and, on September 30, 1925, the “First Four”—Dr. Anna Dengel of Austria, Dr. Johanna Lyons of Chicago, Evelyn Flieger, R.N., originally from Britain, and Marie Ulbrich, R.N., of Luxemburg, Iowa—came together in Washington, D.C., to begin the Medical Mission Sisters. The “First Four” were unable to profess religious vows officially because the Catholic Church had yet to approve Sisters working in the medical field, yet they lived as professed Sisters just the same. Finally, in 1935, after the Medical Mission Sisters had grown, the Catholic Church changed its regulations and approved Sisters’ working in medicine and all of its branches. The Medical Mission Sisters then made their public, canonical vows, and they began to establish communities around the world. Music[edit] The North American headquarters for the Congregation came to be established in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1964 when, like The Singing Nun (Soeur Sourire) had done a year earlier - the Sisters began singing their own homegrown brand of spiritually-themed folk music as an aide to the medical health and wellness they professed. In 1965 one of the most prolific of these composers, Sister Miriam Therese Winter had composed what would become a Grammy-award-winning worldwide hit Joy is Like the Rain.[1] Response was so strong to the song that other songs were written and a marathon eight-hour recording session was commissioned in Philadelphia in early 1966, at which this song was recorded along with dozens of others which would make up their first five albums.[citation needed] Beginnings of international hospitals[edit] In 1965, at the request of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Addis Ababa in Ethiopia, Mother Anna made a visit to that nation to investigate the possibilities of starting a hospital for the people of that nation. Two Medical Mission Sisters arrived in Ethiopia in 1967 to start the groundwork for this mission. A few more Sisters came in 1969, and their work was able to begin. As of 2008, there were a dozen Sisters serving there, both foreigners and native Ethiopians.[2] Current status[edit] As of 2010, there are about 600 Sisters in the congregation, serving in 17 nations around the globe. The four first Sisters of the Congregation were from three different nations. In keeping with this heritage of internationality among the ""First Four"", the Sisters in the Congregation today come from 23 nations. The Sisters serve in a wide variety of ways. Among them, through: health care and education; wholeness and wellness programs; the development of women; work for justice; worship and spirituality; and music and song. They also have 80 Associates, women and men of many nations who share their values and have committed themselves to live the mission of the Society, which is ""to be a healing presence at the heart of a wounded world."" As examples of the range of services the Sisters do in different countries: In India, the Sisters run the Center for Healing and Integration, to train the people low to get low-cost health care through natural resources. In Pasco County, Florida, they run a community-based program to connect the unemployed with potential employers. A Learning Center for Ecological Spirituality was established in Udenhout, the Netherlands.[3] Sr. Margaret McKenna runs a drug recover center.[4] Medical Mission Sisters have worked as course instructors since its inception at the Holy Cross - Centre for Christian Meditation and Spirituality in the Holy Cross Church in Frankfurt-Bornheim.[5][6] See also[edit] Anna Dengel Miriam Therese Winter Monika Hellwig References[edit] ^ Joy is Like the Rain ^ Ethiopian Catholic Church Archived 2011-05-21 at the Wayback Machine ^ Medical Mission Sisters website ^ Kolodziej, Maureen (2006).

After months of traveling to give talks about the conditions in India, and speaking with many members of the clergy, Dr. Dengel became convinced that only a group of Religious Sisters who had been professionally trained as physicians could reach these women, who were cut off from adequate medical care by cultural and religious traditions. Such a project, however, was contrary to canon law of the time, which prohibited members of religious institutes from practicing medicine. Nevertheless, she drew up a Constitution for the Community she had in mind and wrote that the members were “to live for God...to dedicate themselves to the service of the sick for the love of God and ...to be properly trained according to the knowledge and standards of the time in order to practice medicine in its full scope, to which the Sisters were to dedicate their lives.” Permission was granted on June 12, 1925, to begin the new Congregation and, on September 30, 1925, the “First Four”—Dr. Anna Dengel of Austria, Dr. Johanna Lyons of Chicago, Evelyn Flieger, R.N., originally from Britain, and Marie Ulbrich, R.N., of Luxemburg, Iowa—came together in Washington, D.C., to begin the Medical Mission Sisters. The “First Four” were unable to profess religious vows officially because the Catholic Church had yet to approve Sisters working in the medical field, yet they lived as professed Sisters just the same. Finally, in 1935, after the Medical Mission Sisters had grown, the Catholic Church changed its regulations and approved Sisters’ working in medicine and all of its branches. The Medical Mission Sisters then made their public, canonical vows, and they began to establish communities around the world. Music[edit] The North American headquarters for the Congregation came to be established in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1964 when, like The Singing Nun (Soeur Sourire) had done a year earlier - the Sisters began singing their own homegrown brand of spiritually-themed folk music as an aide to the medical health and wellness they professed. In 1965 one of the most prolific of these composers, Sister Miriam Therese Winter had composed what would become a Grammy-award-winning worldwide hit Joy is Like the Rain.[1] Response was so strong to the song that other songs were written and a marathon eight-hour recording session was commissioned in Philadelphia in early 1966, at which this song was recorded along with dozens of others which would make up their first five albums.[citation needed] Beginnings of international hospitals[edit] In 1965, at the request of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Addis Ababa in Ethiopia, Mother Anna made a visit to that nation to investigate the possibilities of starting a hospital for the people of that nation. Two Medical Mission Sisters arrived in Ethiopia in 1967 to start the groundwork for this mission. A few more Sisters came in 1969, and their work was able to begin. As of 2008, there were a dozen Sisters serving there, both foreigners and native Ethiopians.[2] Current status[edit] As of 2010, there are about 600 Sisters in the congregation, serving in 17 nations around the globe. The four first Sisters of the Congregation were from three different nations. In keeping with this heritage of internationality among the ""First Four"", the Sisters in the Congregation today come from 23 nations. The Sisters serve in a wide variety of ways. Among them, through: health care and education; wholeness and wellness programs; the development of women; work for justice; worship and spirituality; and music and song. They also have 80 Associates, women and men of many nations who share their values and have committed themselves to live the mission of the Society, which is ""to be a healing presence at the heart of a wounded world."" As examples of the range of services the Sisters do in different countries: In India, the Sisters run the Center for Healing and Integration, to train the people low to get low-cost health care through natural resources. In Pasco County, Florida, they run a community-based program to connect the unemployed with potential employers. A Learning Center for Ecological Spirituality was established in Udenhout, the Netherlands.[3] Sr. Margaret McKenna runs a drug recover center.[4] Medical Mission Sisters have worked as course instructors since its inception at the Holy Cross - Centre for Christian Meditation and Spirituality in the Holy Cross Church in Frankfurt-Bornheim.[5][6] See also[edit] Anna Dengel Miriam Therese Winter Monika Hellwig References[edit] ^ Joy is Like the Rain ^ Ethiopian Catholic Church Archived 2011-05-21 at the Wayback Machine ^ Medical Mission Sisters website ^ Kolodziej, Maureen (2006).

China Society of Entrepreneurs and Ecology (SEE), Alxa, Inner Mongolia, China Summary: Introduction to the SEE, an environmental NGO News Status: Active News Category: Secretariat, CivilSociety, RCU_Asia Media Type: Photo Language: English (United States) Body: ​​​ The Society of Entrepreneurs and Ecology, Alxa Prefecture of Inner Mongolia (SEE) is an environmental NGO which is founded by almost 100 Chinese entrepreneurs in the Alxa Prefecture, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China in 2004. SEE is mainly focused on sand dune stabilization, desertification control, and land degradation rehabilitation, especially in Alxa Prefucture and other affected regions in Western China. In this field, SEE has established two projects – Plantation of One Hundred Million Haloxylon Ammodendron spp. Shrubs and Dry Farming of Millet Crop cultivation in Alxa Prefecture. <Figure​ 1. The Plantation of One Hundred Million Haloxylon Ammodendron spp. Shrubs Project.> Alxa Prefecture, located at the east edge of Tengger Sand Desert, far west area of Inner Mongolia, is characterized by arid climate with strong winds and rich moving sand source. Experts believe that degradation of arid desert ecosystem of the Alxa Prefecture will surely affect two million square kilometers of its neighboring regions and provinces. It is concluded that the effectiveness of protecting and remaining of the arid land ecosystem in the Alxa Prefecture will help improve the degraded ecosystem and living environment of the Three North Region of China (Northwest China, Northeast China and Northern Plain of China). The three well-known deserts, the Badain Jilin Sand Desert, the Tengger Sand Desert and the Ulan Buh Desert, have already converged across the project district and are gradually spreading. In order to prevent Alxa and its neighboring regions from further desertification, some biological approaches to combat desertification and control land degradation are needed, such as windbreaks, sandbreaks and artificial barriers to stop sand movement and mitigate desertification. The 800 sq. kilometer vegetation plantation in the Alxa Prefecture, which is mainly composed of Haloxylon Ammodendron spp shrubs, has been severely damaged.  The natural regeneration rate of Haloxylon Ammodendron spp. shrubs in the dry land is very slow. Therefore, artificial plantation based on local condition was implemented to recover and revegetate man-made biological barriers against dust and sand storm, desertification and land degradation through rational plantation of Haloxylon Ammodendron spp. In the affected areas, including its neighbouring regions. After selecting the regions suitable for Haloxylon Ammodendron spp. Plantation, the SEE project operates a set of standardized procedures to plant the desert plant. To improve the degraded arid land ecosystem and desert steppe, SEE will also conduct plantation of Haloxylon Ammodendron spp. with rational density, 750 individuals of the plant per ha. <Figure 2. SEE staff reviewing the Ha​loxylon Ammodendron spp.shrubs plantation with local ​partners, autumn in 2014> ​​ For collective impact, SEE cooperate with local governments, communities, farmers/herds and entrepreneurs to mitigate desertification, land degradation and stabilize shifting sands and rehabilitate the degraded ecosystem, to increase income of local villagers, and to improve economy and ecology at the same time. In addition, SEE will seek donations from domestic CSOs, corporates, and individuals in different ways to continue this project. ​<Figure 3. Dry Farming of Millet Crop cu​ltivation in Alxa Prefecture> The “Dry Farming of Millet Crop” project is a milestone toward solving current environmental problems in Alxa Prefecture through social entrepreneurship to protect the underground water resources in oasis. The Millet Crop is cultivated at the periphery of the Tengger Sand Desert and Yaoba Oasis of the Alxa Prefecture, Inner Mongolia, which is characterized by arid sand desert, irrigated oasis and desert steppe in West part of Inner Mongolia. In the Alxa Prefecture, most of the crops are high-water-consuming maize. SEE and its social enterprise aim to encourage more farmers to cultivate millet instead of maize, because millet is a water-saving crop. Since 2009, SEE started experiment for planting this millet crop in consideration of local soil condition and climate regime. After five years of practice, SEE has gradually developed planting guidelines and skill for planting water-saving millet, which is welcome cereal at both rural and urban levels with satisfied production of this organic crop.

A refugee camp in Kenya was the first to receive a large scale solar cooking project - The Kakuma Refugee Camp was formed in 1972 when Sudanese refugees first arrived in Kakuma, Kenya. Introducing solar cooking to the camp was Solar Cookers International’s first large-scale refugee project, beginning in January 1995. Kakuma had considerable refugee turnover, but by 2004, when Solar Cookers International (SCI) concluded the project, the camp had tripled in size to nearly 90,000 refugees. Though rapid growth posed problems for assisting all those who wanted to solar cook, SCI ultimately served over 15,000 families. This project was one of the earliest to use the CooKit solar panel cooker to introduce solar cooking. The program also extended solar cooker technology to schools, especially primary school, through demonstrations, poems, songs and drama. See other most significant solar cooking projects worldwide. News NEW: August 2021: SCI named as winner! - Solar Cookers International has been named as a winner in the Keeling Curve Prize for sustainable planet solutions. SCI won for its work “improving human and environmental health by supporting the expansion of effective carbon-free solar cooking in world regions of greatest need” in the Social and Cultural Pathways category. Dr. Shishpal Rawat, SCI’s Board President, said, “This recognition helps elevate the role of solar cookers as a key technology to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.” SCI estimates that there are over four million solar cookers directly and positively impacting over 14 million people, preventing over 5.8 million tons of CO2 emissions annually, equivalent to taking more than 1.25 million cars off the road, and an estimated 30 million tons of CO2 is prevented over the lifetime of solar cookers distributed, equivalent to not burning over 34 billion pounds of coal or driving over 76 billion miles.

22,"1000 Solutions to change the World AboutThe foundationBertrand PiccardEducationPartnersTeam About the foundation 1000+ Solutions to change the World Watch the video Watch the video A Challenge Efficient solutions for a clean economic growth To address sustainability challenges while enabling economic growth, Bertrand Piccard and the Solar Impulse Foundation have identified 1000+ clean and profitable solutions. The Solar Impulse Foundation has organized these solutions into a Guide in order to support their implementation at scale. By giving political and economic decision-makers the tools to adopt much more ambitious energy and environmental policies, the Foundation will help them to set a roadmap to reach their environmental objectives. A Vision Bertrand Piccard One of the first to envision ecology through the lens of profitability, Bertrand Piccard has always advocated that solving climate change – rather than an expensive problem – is a fantastic market opportunity. He actively speaks out against the absurdity of the outdated and polluting devices and systems we are still using and promotes the benefits of existing efficient technologies to motivate governments and industries to take action. More about Bertrand Piccard Protection of the environment would become a reality only if it was perceived as economically viable and requiring no financial or behavioral sacrifices. Today, efficient solutions exist that can boost economic growth, while at the same time reducing our impact on the planet. Bertrand Piccard Testimonials What they say about us They are decision makers but also pioneers in theirs fields, encouraging new ways of building a cleaner and sustainable world. They believe in the impact of our action. Patricia Espinosa Executive Secretary, UNFCCC “Initiatives like the World Alliance and its goal of selecting 1000 efficient solutions, are exactly what we need to further enable investors, governments, cities and citizens to harvest the rich variety of clean technologies that already exist or are under development, and accomplish the goals of the Paris Climate Change Agreement and all the Sustainable Development Goals to catalyse a healthy and prosperous future for all.” Dr. Fatih Birol Executive Director of the International Energy Agency “It is inspiring to see so many technology and business ideas with the Efficient Solutions Label that could help reduce emissions. The IEA supports efforts to achieve a secure, sustainable energy future for all – and innovation will play a vital role.” Werner Hoyer President of the European Investment Bank “It is our ambition to mobilise EUR 1 trillion in climate action and environmental sustainability investment by 2030 – however, EIB is not only about big numbers. This partnership opens doors for hundreds of project promoters that are already benefitting from the support of the Solar Impulse Foundation, and now also have access to the EIB Group and its network of investors.” Maroš Šefčovič Vice-President, European Commission “Europe is committed to a clean energy transition. But this can only happen if we break down silos, if all those who share this commitment work together and focus on tangible and efficient solutions. That it is why I support the World Alliance: it creates an umbrella of solution providers, government representatives, start-ups, established companies, financers, local authorities, national governments, intergovernmental organizations. I look forward to hearing about the 1000 solutions, and I can guarantee full support of the European Commission in this important journey.” Historic Flight 1st round-the-world with a solar airplane When Bertrand Piccard completed the first ever solar-powered flight around the world in July 2016,  his speech emphasized that Solar Impulse had achieved a first for energy even more than a first for aviation. This historical flight highlighted that clean technologies can achieve impossible goals and should be used much more for reducing our energy consumption, protect natural resources and improve the quality of life on Earth.

Climate Change Conference.[17] In February 2020, Piccard told GreenBiz that the solar powered-flight around the world was phase I, and in phase II the Solar Impulse Foundation would certify and promote 1000 profitable technologies that decarbonize systems, cut energy use and clean up air and water.[4] In an interview in June 2018 with La Tribune, Piccard stated that solutions from all over the world can apply for the Efficient Solution Label.[18] At that time Piccard said the Solar Impulse Foundation had received applications from 700 companies.[18] To apply for the Efficient Solution Label from the Solar Impulse Foundation, companies must be members of the World Alliance, which is free to join.[14] They must also fill out an extensive application and go through an Ernst & Young-certified process where their solutions are vetted by members of the World Alliance to evaluate the potential for economic success and to estimate the length of the payback period for investors.[2][14] To qualify for the label, solutions must fit one of five sustainable development goals from the United Nations, specifically water, clean energy, industry, cities, and responsible consumption and production.[14] They must also be available for purchase or ready for market.[14] In his January 2021 LCI interview Piccard stated that 420 experts had approved and labeled 850 solutions, growing from 400 labeled solutions in October 2020 and from 287 a year earlier.[17][19][20] Piccard stated in a Reuters interview that the foundation planned to reach 1000 labeled solutions in mid-April 2021.[2] On April 13, 2021, the foundation announced that it had identified all 1000 solutions.[21] Funding and Partnerships[edit] The Solar Impulse foundation receives financial support from its 16 corporate sponsors, which include Swiss food and drink company Nestlé, an organization that helped provide food for the two pilots on the round-the-world flight Solar Impulse 2; Air Liquide, Solvay, and others, as well as private donors.[2][16] The Solar Impulse Foundation funds the World Alliance for Efficient Solutions, whose annual operating budget was reported by GreenBiz in 2018 to be $2.9 million U.S. dollars per year.[14] The World Alliance also collaborates with other global environmental organizations, including the World Economic Forum, IEA, IRENA, and others.[14] In May 2020, Piccard and the corporate partners of the Solar Impulse Foundation published a statement in the Financial Times calling governments to prioritize the implementation of clean technologies in their global COVID-19 recovery efforts.[22] This commitment was co-authored by 12 Solar Impulse Foundation business partners, including French utility Engie; European energy company Schneider Electric and nine more.[22][23] In December 2020, CNN reported that the Solar Impulse Foundation was supporting close to 400 companies with solutions that help the environment.[24] See also[edit] Solar Impulse World Alliance for Clean Technologies References[edit] ^ a b c d Mun-Delsalle, Y-Jean (March 7, 2015).

Make A Donation Home Projects Solutions From the Land Projects Solutions From the Land Solutions From the Land (SFL) is a national dialogue of landowners and conservationists focused on the sustainable policies and practices needed to meet food, feed, fiber and energy production needs while protecting natural resources and ecosystems. In a report released in March 2013, SFL identified five broad challenges around which future policies, practices and land management approaches might be constructed. This report “was developed to help jump start a solutions-oriented, forward-looking conversation about America’s agricultural and forestry future,” said A.G. Kawamura, owner/partner of Orange County Produce, LLC and co-chair of SFL. The report, A New Vision for United States Agriculture, Forestry and Conservation, is the result of a three-year conversation among thought leaders in agriculture, forestry and conservation to identify the land challenges faced today and in the years ahead, and propose pathways to address those challenges. The pathways proposed are not intended to be prescriptive, but rather to serve as the basis for robust, solutions-oriented conversations among the diverse range of stakeholders with interests in land use issues. This includes foresters, farmers, ranchers, conservationists, community leaders, recreation enthusiasts, the wildlife community, policy makers and agribusiness leaders. Read the full report:  A New Vision for United States Agriculture, Forestry and Conservation Read the Executive Summary The SFL report identifies five broad challenges to land management: Loss of working lands. Conflicting policies and inadequate rewards for ecosystem services. Declining investments in research and innovation. The changing climate. Multiple risks, such as volatile global markets, policy uncertainties and unpredictable weather. The report also identifies potential ways to address these challenges: Implement landscape-scale solutions through coalitions of many stakeholders. Harmonize policy frameworks by reconciling conflicting policies and removing redundant paperwork. Develop a clear system to measure the value of ecosystem services and reward that stewardship accordingly. Energize and coordinate land management research. Transform and modernize networks to share information on sustainable practices. Each of these five areas requires further development through a national conversation among the stakeholders to produce workable solutions that can realistically be delivered from the land.  SFL is working to encourage groups and individuals to get involved. For more information on opportunities to get involved in the SFL conversation visit the SFL website www.sfldialogue.net. SFL’s founding partners include Farm Foundation, NFP, The Nature Conservancy, the United Nations  Foundation and Conservation International.

Among the many projects and programs funded by UNFSSC, below are a few highlights: In 2017, the Global South-South Development (GSSD) Expo was hosted by the Government of Turkey in Antalya. GSSD Expo is an annual event organized by the United Nations Office for South-South Cooperation (UNOSSC) in collaboration with United Nations agencies and other partners. The event strategically engaged all development actors, including the private sector, civil society, academic and philanthropic organizations, to scale up concrete Southern-grown initiatives to help achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. More than 800 delegates from over 120 United Nations Member States participated in the 2017 Expo, which featured 37 sessions organized by close to 50 institutional partners. The South-South Development Center (SSDC), a partnership between the China International Center for Economic and Technical Exchanges (CICETE) and UNOSSC, successfully completed China Development Report on South-South Cooperation IV in 2017 which aims to present a systematic analysis of the history of the economic and trade cooperation between China and Africa. In addition, the SSDC provided five new small grants to SSDC members to facilitate South-South knowledge sharing and technology exchange in areas including sustainable building materials; small hydropower; and agricultural development. The Third Regional Networking Forum for the Arab States, Europe and the CIS on Scaling Up Southern Development Solutions through Advanced Youth Leadership was conducted as a side-event of the GSSD Expo 2017 in Antalya, Turkey in November 2017. It joined over 60 participants, including national focal points, heads and high-levels of international and regional organizations and institutions, OIC institutions, and UN agencies and funds contributing to empowering youth as key actors in attaining the SDGs. The South-South Global Assets and Technology Exchange (SS-GATE), established as a global and sustainable South-South transaction platform to facilitate market-driven, transparent exchanges of technology, assets, services and financial resources among the private sector, public sector, and civil society, underwent a final project evaluation. This evaluation found that SS-GATE was well established and successfully carried out its mandate. Overall, the platform was effective, efficient, well maintained and sustainable. UNOSSC welcomed the transition of SS-GATE to sustainability with the Secretariat as an independent organization and encouraged the organization to explore ways to maintain and enhance the platform. The United Nations Southern Climate Partnership Incubator (SCPI), a joint initiative between the Executive Office of the Secretary-General and UNOSSC to foster, support, and promote South-South and triangular cooperation on climate change, organized a High-level Forum on South-South Cooperation on Climate Change titled, “Partnership for Climate-Friendly and Sustainable Development: Southern Countries in Action” at the 22nd Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Bonn, Germany. The event was attended by senior officials from over one dozen developing countries as well as participants from member states, civil society groups, financial institutions, and business men and women. The United Nations officially announced the South-South Cooperation Action Plan, which is an integral part of the implementation of the Secretary-General’s United Nations system-wide Climate Change Engagement Strategy. The Maritime-Continental Silk Road Cities Alliance (MCSR CA) is an initiative launched, under the umbrella of the “Belt and Road Initiative” championed by China, to promote dialogue between cities and facilitate the building of partnerships for development at the city level. UNOSSC and China International Centre for Economic and Technical Exchanges, under the Ministry of Commerce, jointly implemented a new global project in September 2017 to support the institutional building of the MCSR CA. Since then, the MCSR CA have been organizing or planning several activities and exhibitions, and participating at several global events including the UN Habitat’s World Urban Forum 9 in KL, Malaysia; 2018 High-Level International Forum on Sustainable Urban Development in Chengdu, China; Bridges for Cities Forum in Vienna, Austria; and the World Green Economy Summit in Dubai, UAE. In addition, contributions to the fund have had an upward trajectory, as member states and organizations contributed $8.5 million towards innovative pilot SSC projects, nearly double that of the previous year. Finally, this year, the United Nations Office for South-South Cooperation (UNOSSC) developed a new strategic framework for 2018-2021. This framework responds to requests from member states to strengthen knowledge-sharing and access to high-quality advisory services, as well as facilitate demand-driven initiatives that address the needs of developing countries. UNOSSC is actively working to provide advisory services and promote knowledge of South-South principles and practices gained during the management of the UNFSSC as well as other UNOSSC trust funds.

South-South Cooperation is a term historically used to describe the exchange of resources, technology, and knowledge between developing countries, and is being promoted as an essential cross-cutting mechanism designed to deliver capacity building and technology support activities in developing countries and regions of the South. South-South cooperation can also be identified as a complement to North-South cooperation to enhance technical, financial, scientific and technological exchanges and innovations for development. Triangular cooperation involves two or more developing countries in collaboration with a third party, typically a developed country government or organization, contributing to the exchanges with its own know-how and resources. Why is it important? Biodiversity is a key economic, financial, cultural, and strategic asset for developing countries, and is critical for economic and social development as well as poverty reduction. The loss of biodiversity undermines the possibilities for sustained growth of developing countries. Considering that the 2010 target to achieve a significant reduction of the current rate of biodiversity loss was not met and that the majority of the world’s biodiversity resides in the global “South”, it is obvious that developing countries are facing the serious challenge of sustainable development. Traditional North-South cooperation has continuously been used in the efforts to cope with this crisis. However, the potential of developing countries has been growing rapidly by accumulating knowledge, experience and expertise on biodiversity in recent years. With this increased capacity, South-South cooperation can in many ways complement North-South exchanges with a more efficient use of resources. Under these circumstances, the Parties to the CBD have recognized the urgent need to enhance implementation of the Convention through South-South and triangular cooperation, and welcomed the Multi-Year Plan of Action for South-South Cooperation on Biodiversity for Development (adopted by the Group of 77 and China at the South-South Cooperation Forum held on 17 October 2010 in Nagoya, Japan) as an important contribution to the implementation of the 2011-2020 Strategic Plan of the CBD (Decision X/23).

SACAU was originally formed in 1992 by six farmer organizations[1]but has since expanded its membership to include 17 farmer organisations in 12 countries.[2] In addition, there are associate members, including regional commodity organizations and private companies associated with agricultural value chains on a regional basis.[2] SACAU's headquarters are in Centurion, Republic of South Africa. SACAU aims to be the main voice of farmers within the region and to promote effective producers’ organizations in all regional countries. Its mandate is to foster understanding between farmers’ organisations and policymakers in southern Africa by providing a forum for the discussion of matters of common interest and by disseminating information about agriculture in the region to relevant agencies, organizations and companies. [3]It has been very successful in obtaining external support for such activities, giving it an annual budget far in excess of that obtained from its annual membership fee. Funding bodies include:[4] Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA) Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) European Commission International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD) Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation ACP-EU (CTA) References[edit] ^ ""SACAU Profile"".

37,"Strategy - SACAU Home Membership Strategy Partnerships & Collaborations Board of Directors Secretariat Publications Contact Us Select Page Strategy Strategy SACAU’s Strategic Framework, subtitled “The future we want: a well-performing, sustainable and globally competitive agricultural sector for southern Africa”, articulates the ambitions of the organisation for the period 2019 – 2023. Its overall objective is to promote the growth and development of a productive, inclusive, and globally competitive agricultural sector in southern Africa. The framework is underpinned by three strategic areas of work (SAW), namely: (SAW1) Advocacy for a strong and well-performing agricultural sector in southern Africa; (SAW2) capacity development of farmers’ organisations (FOs); and (SAW3) the provision of strategic information to members and stakeholders. SAW1 is aimed at influencing policies that support the growth and development of an agricultural sector that is competitive and globally significant, while the SAW2 aims to strengthen the organisational and technical competencies of FOs. Lastly, SAW3 aims to support informed choices and strategic decision making by farmers organisation and to enhance the image of agriculture in the region. Projects, which are the main instrument for operationalising the strategy, are developed and implemented within this framework, thereby minimising diversion from strategic intentions.

SSN carries this out by connecting people and information, increasing capability and mobilising resources to innovatively respond to challenges and opportunities presented by a changing climate. SSN envisions “a climate resilient world, where ethical and equitable resource management drives a sustainable future.” SSN projects are funded by The Adaptation Fund, UK Department for International Development, Natural Environment Research Council, and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation. One of SSNs larger community focused projects The Community Adaptation Small Grants Facility (SGF), was an adaptation project costing 29 million ZAR; which ran from 2015-2020. The project was based in two target areas in South Africa: the Namakwa District in the Northern Cape and the Mopani district in Limpopo. The SGF project aims to reduce vulnerability and increase resilience to the projected impacts of climate change within vulnerable rural communities within the aforementioned regions. This is done by a granting mechanism known as enhanced direct access, which allows civil society organisations access to climate finance to apply locally relevant adaptation projects at a community-level. The three types of adaptation funded by the SGF are: ClimateSmart Agriculture, Climate Resilient Livelihoods and Climate Proof Settlements. To date, the SGF project has provided 13 small grants with an approved combined value of 18 million ZAR; this has benefited 1762 women, 1248 men, and 964 youth. Climate adaptation technologies established through the SGF in rural communities are: 12 saving groups, 2 compost toilets, 65 (350 offspring) climate-resilient livestock, 40 water tanks, 10 homes insulated. The agricultural sector of South Africa is projected to be one of the hardest hit sectors by climate change as it is a naturally water scarce country and water resources are expected to be further constrained by the impacts of climate change. Particularly vulnerable are small-scale farmers without resources to adapt to changes that would allow for continued farming in a very different climate in the near-future. Adaptation initiatives such as the SGF have great potential in South Africa given the success in the two target areas. The effects of climate change are already being felt, as once prominent agricultural regions are facing extreme water shortages such as the Eastern Cape and the Western Cape. The continuation of the small-scale agricultural sector in South Africa is dependent on adaptive techniques to combat a changing climate. 380 Like this post?

Overview Current Grants Grantmaking History FAQ Strategic grants to catalyze real-world results ClimateWorks manages a portfolio of grants that support organizations and projects working to mitigate climate change. Our grantmaking is guided by portfolio priorities and aligned with our values. ClimateWorks supports regionally based programs in China, Indonesia, Europe, Latin America, and the United States, as well as global and transnational initiatives. We work collaboratively with other foundations that share our commitment to mitigating climate change, at scale. We allocate funds strategically in a way that supports portfolio goals and initiatives. We are a strategic grantmaker, committed to evaluating our work and the work of our partners, learning from our successes and failures, and improving how we work. With a global perspective, we work with partners to understand context and trends, learn from experience, and reveal opportunities for impact. In the process, we contribute to more strategic, efficient, and effective climate philanthropy. ClimateWorks' grantmaking includes core support and project support grants. Core support ClimateWorks collaborates with and provides core support grants to a global network of regional partners whose missions align with ours. These organizations play a central role in developing portfolios of philanthropic investments designed to achieve large-scale greenhouse gas emissions reductions in the regions and countries where they operate. Working with a host of local grantees, regional partners design and lead geographically based strategies and fund fine-grained grant portfolios. Project support ClimateWorks supports mature, emerging, and experimental opportunities to curb climate change. Project grants fund global, regional, and transnational strategies that ClimateWorks develops, implements, and monitors. Most of our project support grants prioritize global and transnational opportunities, and we work closely with our foundation partners to invest in potentially game-changing opportunities. Project grants also enable rapid response to emerging opportunities and challenges in the field. We also make grants on behalf of programs and initiatives we host.

Through this support, ClimateWorks injected unprecedented philanthropic capital into the climate and clean energy field. In total, during our first six years, ClimateWorks awarded 868 grants to 227 grantees, totaling $799,152,683. ClimateWorks’ annual reports include more information about our grantmaking history. During this period, the strategies that ClimateWorks supported — along with countless other funders and grantees — helped bring about significant policy change in the regions and sectors with the greatest greenhouse gas emissions. In total, we estimate that these associated policy outcomes have the potential to reduce approximately 5.6 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide per year by 2020 — more than the annual emissions of 1,400 coal-fired power plants. These results, while not nearly enough to put the world on a 2°C pathway, show that there is momentum for change and opportunities for philanthropy to make a difference in the fight against climate change.

Climate Action Network South Asia (CANSA) statement on the signing of Paris Climate Agreement [22 April 2016, New Delhi/Colombo]: Climate Action Network South Asia (CANSA), a coalition of over 140 civil society organizations of south Asia, welcomed the ceremonial signing of the Paris Climate Agreement at the United Nations in New York today by more than 160 countries as a welcome first step confirming commitments made by these countries at the 21st Conference of Parties of UNFCCC in Paris in December. CANSA Director Sanjay Vashist said: “World governments must urgently turn these commitments into action by ratifying and implementing the Paris Climate Agreement at a national level while ratcheting up their ambition towards climate action as the current commitments are not enough to avoid a world that is 3°C warmer. The first three months of 2016 are already recorded as warmest in hundred years and effects of which can be seen across the subcontinent reeling under unprecedented heat waves that has already claimed hundreds of lives.” CANSA Policy & Advocacy Coordinator Ms. Vositha Wijenayake said: “Now more than ever developed countries have to ensure that adequate climate finance is in place to help millions of vulnerable people to respond to the worst impacts of climate change. The current Paris agreement is still unclear on how climate action will be implemented equitably and fairly.  This should be the key priority for negotiators meeting at Bonn next month to pick up where the Paris climate meeting left off.” For more information and interviews: Mr. Sanjay Vashist : Telephone: +91 99100 961625;  Email – sanjay@cansouthasia.net Ms. Vositha Wijenayake : Telephone : +94 777 597 387;  Email – vositha@cansouthasia.net Contact We wish to learn from you.

Hivos verschaft financiële en politieke ondersteuning aan partnerorganisaties in Afrika, Latijns-Amerika en Azië. Samen met deze lokale organisaties wil Hivos een bijdrage leveren aan een vrije, eerlijke en duurzame wereld, waarin iedereen gelijke toegang heeft tot middelen en kansen voor ontwikkeling. Hivos is ervan overtuigd dat als mensen een eerlijke kans krijgen, hun mogelijkheden bijna onbegrensd zijn. Vandaar ook de slogan van Hivos: ""people unlimited"". Een belangrijke leidraad is de versterking van de maatschappelijke positie van vrouwen, lhbti's en andere gemarginaliseerde groepen. Hivos © Vysotsky, CC BY-SA 4.0 Hoofdkantoor Den Haag Motto people unlimited Media Website http://www.hivos.nl Inhoud 1 Geschiedenis 2 Organisatie 3 Humanistische waarden 4 Werkwijze 5 Thema's 6 Samenwerking 7 Externe link Geschiedenis De stichting Hivos werd opgericht in 1968 door het Humanistisch Verbond, de Vereniging Weezenkas en Humanitas. Hivos strijdt voor een vrije, eerlijke en duurzame wereld. Hivos werkt hiervoor samen met partnerorganisaties in Afrika, Azië en Latijns-Amerika en partners in Nederland en Europa. Hivos nam in de jaren 1980 als een van de eerste Nederlandse ngo’s het besluit regionale kantoren te openen in bijvoorbeeld Zimbabwe (1988) en Costa Rica (1994). De meeste programma’s worden uitgevoerd door de regionale Hivos-hubs in Latijns-Amerika, Oost-Afrika, Zuidelijk Afrika en MENA (Midden-Oosten en Noord-Afrika). Daarnaast zijn er in acht landen kleinere kantoren. Hivos draagt het werk in Zuidoost-Azië over aan de lokale NGO in oprichting, de Yayasan Hivos in Jakarta, Indonesie. In 2020 werkte Hivos samen met 563 partnerorganisaties, waarvan 111 in Latijns Amerika, 291 in Afrika en 117 in Azië. Organisatie Begin 2020 telde Hivos in totaal 375 werknemers, van wie ongeveer 130 op het hoofdkantoor in Den Haag en 265 op de regiokantoren in Jakarta (Indonesië), San José (Costa Rica), Harare (Zimbabwe) en Nairobi (Kenia) of op een van de acht additionele landenkantoren werkzaam waren. Hivos wordt bestuurd door een raad van bestuur. Het managementteam bestaat uit de hoofden van de afdelingen 'Strategie & impact' en 'Bisnuss development', de vier directeuren van de regionale hoofdkantoren en een aantal ander management functies. Boven de directie staat de raad van toezicht; daarnaast kan de directie een beroep doen op een college van adviseurs. Humanistische waarden Het humanistische gedachtegoed staat centraal in het beleid van Hivos. Het Humanisme stelt de mens centraal en gaat uit van diens waarde. Kernelementen van het beleid zijn daarom: menselijke waardigheid en zelfbeschikking, afkeer van dogmatisme en autoritaire stelsels, pluralisme en democratie, onderlinge solidariteit, verantwoordelijk burgerschap, en respect voor de culturele en sociale identiteit. Bij de uitvoering van het werk hanteert Hivos de onderstaande uitgangspunten: Vrijheid en waardigheid: Ieder mens heeft het recht om in vrijheid en waardigheid te leven, ongeacht seksuele geaardheid, etniciteit, religie of sociaaleconomische positie. Mensen moeten de vrijheid hebben om te geloven wat ze willen en te zijn wie ze zijn, hun mening te uiten en de gevestigde orde uit te dagen en te beïnvloeden. Verantwoord burgerschap: Mensen hebben zowel rechten als plichten en verantwoordelijkheden. Het respecteren van en zorg dragen voor iedereen om ons heen, dichtbij en ver weg, en op een manier leven die anderen en onze planeet niet beschadigt, zou vanzelfsprekend moeten zijn. Zelfbeschikking en diversiteit: Mensen moeten zelf keuzes en beslissingen kunnen maken op basis van hun eigen voorkeuren en interesses, ongedacht hun seksuele geaardheid, afkomst of religie. Ieder mens is uniek en onze diversiteit is iets om te koesteren en te beschermen. Gelijkwaardigheid en rechtvaardigheid: Mensen zijn niet hetzelfde, maar we zijn wel gelijkwaardig. We moeten als zodanig behandeld worden en elkaar ook zo behandelen. Gelijkwaardigheid en rechtvaardigheid moeten tot uiting komen in de manier waarop onze sociale, economische en juridische systemen werken. Duurzaam gebruik van de planeet: De mensheid beschikt over maar een planeet. Een met een rijke maar kwetsbare biodiversiteit en grote maar eindige hulpbronnen. Duurzaam omgaan met de aarde en leven in balans met de natuur is van levensbelang voor huidige en toekomstige generaties. Dit betekent dat niet alleen de impact op het milieu moeten worden verminderd, maar dat er ook actief moet worden gewerkt aan herstellen van wat is aangetast. De toekomst van elk levend wezen hangt daarvan af. Werkwijze Hivos steunt lokale particuliere organisaties in meer dan 33 landen. Aan deze partners levert ze financiële middelen, kennis, advies en politieke ondersteuning. Daarnaast onderneemt de organisatie lobby-activiteiten, zowel lokaal, nationaal en internationaal. Hivos is ervan overtuigd dat moedige mensen de sleutel zijn in het bestrijden van machtsongelijkheid. Hun ideeën en inzet zijn cruciaal bij het realiseren van klimaatrechtvaardigheid, gendergelijkheid, diversiteit en inclusie. Over de hele wereld bevordert Hivos dat gemarginaliseerde groepen gehoord worden en een stem krijgen in het debat. Met hen streeft de organisatie naar structurele verandering. Daarom werkt ze samen met pionierende organisaties, innovatieve bedrijven en bereidwillige overheden. Met hen deelt Hivos een droom waarin economieën duurzaam zijn en samenlevingen openstaan voor iedereen. Thema's Hivos richt zich op: Gendergelijkwaardigheid, diversiteit en inclusie: Zonder gelijkwaardigheid, diversiteit en inclusie bestaat er geen vrije en rechtvaardige samenleving. Daarom wordt gestreden voor gelijke rechten en gelijkwaardige kansen voor alle mensen, ongeacht genderidentiteit- en expressie, geslacht, seksuele oriëntatie, etniciteit, leeftijd, beperkingen, religie of culturele achtergrond. De organisatie vindt dat de stemmen van gemarginaliseerde, gediscrimineerde en uitgesloten groepen gehoord moeten worden en dat hun rechten op alle niveaus worden erkend en gerespecteerd. Daarbij richt ze zich in het bijzonder op (jonge) vrouwen en LHBTIQ+-personen.Klimaatrechtvaardigheid: Goed en effectief klimaatbeleid begint bij het betrekken van groepen die onevenredig hard worden getroffen door klimaatverandering. Daarom is er samenwerking met vrouwen, jongeren, inheemse groepen, arme stadsbewoners en kleine boeren. De organisatie richt zich op het opbouwen van een sterke beweging van maatschappelijke organisaties met een gemeenschappelijke klimaatagenda. Ze helpt bij met druk uitoefenen op besluitvormers en met het krijgen van brede maatschappelijke steun en financiering voor lokale klimaatoplossingen. Burgerrechten en vrijheid van meningsuiting: Over de hele wereld ziet Hivos burgerrechten en vrijheden onder druk staan: verdeeldheid neemt toe, de meest kwetsbaren worden uitgesloten en het vertrouwen in democratische instellingen neemt in rap tempo af. Mensen, organisaties en initiatieven die aan deze ontwikkeling tegengas durven geven worden door Hivos gesteund. Samen met hen bouwt ze aan inclusieve en open samenlevingen waarin iedere stem telt en wordt gehoord.Het Humanistisch Instituut voor Ontwikkelingssamenwerking zet zich tevens in voor de millenniumdoelstellingen zoals opgesteld door de Verenigde Naties. Samenwerking Hivos werkt samen met andere maatschappelijke organisaties, bedrijven en overheden over de hele wereld. Complementariteit – in expertise, werkvelden en rollen – en bundeling van krachten zijn cruciaal in het bereiken van de doelstellingen. In Europees verband werkt Hivos samen met gelijkgezinde ontwikkelingsorganisaties in Alliance2015. Internationale lobby bedrijft ze bij voorkeur op herkenbare thema’s en in nauwe samenwerking met lokale, nationale en internationale partnerorganisaties. In Nederland bundelt de organisatie de krachten met maatschappelijke organisaties die deskundig zijn op een van de beleidsspeerpunten. Daarnaast werkt ze samen met verwante organisaties binnen de brancheorganisatie Partos.

Hivos provides support to civil society organizations working in Africa, Latin America, the Middle East and Asia. Contents 1 History 2 Organization 2.1 Location 2.2 Governance 3 References History[edit] Hivos was founded in 1968 by the Humanist Association, the Association and Humanitas Weezenkas. The founders held the conviction that development work should be secular, as true cooperation presumes respect for differing beliefs. In the first ever brochure, the founders wrote that “necessary changes should spring from communities themselves – from people at the base of society.” These convictions are still reflected in Hivos its work. In the 1980s and 1990s, Hivos was one of the first major Dutch NGOs that opened offices in the Global South to operate in the close vicinity of its civil society partners, beneficiaries and other stakeholders there. Organization[edit] Location[edit] Hivos' Global Office is in The Hague. Hivos currently works in 40 countries and has regional hubs in Latin America, East Africa, Southern Africa and North Africa and the Middle East (MENA). Hivos’ regional hubs, working alongside many partner organizations and take the lead in defining regionally and nationally specific programs. In the next several years, Hivos will particularly seek to expand collaborations and partnerships in the MENA region and increase its advocacy efforts in the Netherlands. It will continue its presence in Latin America and merge the hubs in East Africa and Southern Africa. Hivos will hand over its Southeast Asia activities to the recently formed local NGO Yayasan Hivos in Indonesia. At the beginning of 2020, one third of Hivos staff worked at the Global Office in The Hague, while two-thirds work at regional and country offices. Staff in the regions are mainly non-Dutch and also hold management positions in the regional offices, including those of Regional Director. Governance[edit] Hivos is managed by the Executive Board, consisting of Executive Director Edwin Huizing and the Chief Operations Officer Michel Farkas. The Management Team is made up of the heads of the Strategy and Impact Department and the Business Development Department, the four directors of their regional hubs and a few other management positions. The Strategy and Impact Department is headed by Biranchi Upadhyaya. Will Janssen serves as the head of the Business Development Department. References[edit] ^ a b ""History"". Hivos International.

Samen met hen strijden we voor gelijkwaardige en inclusieve samenlevingen, en verzetten we ons tegen machtsmisbruik. We werken met activisten, journalisten, ondernemers, kunstenaars en innovatieve organisaties in meer dan veertig landen. Zij hebben de originele ideeën en het lef ze uit te voeren. Wij ondersteunen hen met kennis, contacten, geld en bescherming. Zo komen we samen op voor een vrije, eerlijke en duurzame wereld. Onze overtuiging We gaan al meer dan vijftig jaar uit van de kracht van mensen en hun vermogen zélf hun leven vorm te geven. Ongeacht wat zij geloven of hoe zij zichzelf identificeren. De unieke verscheidenheid van mensen is waardevol en moet gekoesterd worden. Want, een leven in vrijheid en waardigheid, met respect voor elkaar en de planeet, leidt tot een groter individueel welzijn en een eerlijke en veerkrachtige samenleving. Tot op de dag van vandaag worden wij door deze overtuiging geïnspireerd en bepaalt het hoe wij naar de wereld kijken. Humanistische oorsprong Hivos is in 1968 opgericht vanuit een humanistische overtuiging. Onze naam staat oorspronkelijk dan ook voor: Humanistisch Instituut voor Ontwikkelingssamenwerking. In het verzuilde Nederland van de jaren zestig, waren onze oprichters ervan overtuigd dat ontwikkelingssamenwerking seculier zou moeten zijn omdat échte samenwerking uitgaat van respect voor álle overtuigingen en alle religies. Onze waarden Onze overtuiging vind je terug in onze waarden. Deze waarden vormen de leidraad van ons werk. Vrijheid en waardigheid Ieder mens heeft het recht om in vrijheid en waardigheid te leven, ongeacht seksuele geaardheid, etniciteit, religie of sociaaleconomische positie. Mensen moeten de vrijheid hebben om te geloven wat ze willen en te zijn wie ze zijn, hun mening te uiten en de gevestigde orde uit te dagen en te beïnvloeden. Verantwoord burgerschap Mensen hebben zowel rechten als plichten en verantwoordelijkheden. Het respecteren van en zorg dragen voor iedereen om ons heen, dichtbij en ver weg, en op een manier leven die anderen en onze planeet niet beschadigt, zou vanzelfsprekend moeten zijn.

Dit betekent dat we niet alleen onze impact op het milieu moeten verminderen, maar ook actief moeten werken aan herstellen wat al is aangetast. De toekomst van elk levend wezen hangt hiervan af. Waar wij aan werken Werken aan een rechtvaardige en inclusieve samenleving verreist een lange adem. Hivos is ervan overtuigd dat moedige mensen de sleutel zijn in het bestrijden van machtsongelijkheid. Hun ideeën en inzet zijn cruciaal bij het realiseren van klimaatrechtvaardigheid, gendergelijkheid, diversiteit en inclusie.

Daarom werken we ook samen met pionierende organisaties, innovatieve bedrijven en bereidwillige overheden. Met hen delen wij een droom waarin economieën duurzaam zijn en samenlevingen openstaan voor iedereen. Om dat voor elkaar te krijgen, richt ons werk zich op drie gebieden. Gendergelijkwaardigheid, diversiteit en inclusie Zonder gelijkwaardigheid, diversiteit en inclusie bestaat er geen vrije en rechtvaardige samenleving. Daarom strijden wij voor gelijke rechten en gelijkwaardige kansen voor alle mensen, ongeacht genderidentiteit- en expressie, geslacht, seksuele oriëntatie, etniciteit, leeftijd, beperkingen, religie of culturele achtergrond.

Contents 1 History 2 Organization 2.1 Location 2.2 Governance 3 References History[edit] Hivos was founded in 1968 by the Humanist Association, the Association and Humanitas Weezenkas. The founders held the conviction that development work should be secular, as true cooperation presumes respect for differing beliefs. In the first ever brochure, the founders wrote that “necessary changes should spring from communities themselves – from people at the base of society.” These convictions are still reflected in Hivos its work. In the 1980s and 1990s, Hivos was one of the first major Dutch NGOs that opened offices in the Global South to operate in the close vicinity of its civil society partners, beneficiaries and other stakeholders there. Organization[edit] Location[edit] Hivos' Global Office is in The Hague. Hivos currently works in 40 countries and has regional hubs in Latin America, East Africa, Southern Africa and North Africa and the Middle East (MENA). Hivos’ regional hubs, working alongside many partner organizations and take the lead in defining regionally and nationally specific programs. In the next several years, Hivos will particularly seek to expand collaborations and partnerships in the MENA region and increase its advocacy efforts in the Netherlands. It will continue its presence in Latin America and merge the hubs in East Africa and Southern Africa. Hivos will hand over its Southeast Asia activities to the recently formed local NGO Yayasan Hivos in Indonesia. At the beginning of 2020, one third of Hivos staff worked at the Global Office in The Hague, while two-thirds work at regional and country offices. Staff in the regions are mainly non-Dutch and also hold management positions in the regional offices, including those of Regional Director. Governance[edit] Hivos is managed by the Executive Board, consisting of Executive Director Edwin Huizing and the Chief Operations Officer Michel Farkas.

It is also a digital tool that the EU-LAC International Foundation makes available to public entities and civil society actors interested in collaborating in the framework of this strategic partnership. Its purpose is to facilitate mutual knowledge and visibility of the work of different organisations in both regions, providing information on opportunities to promote projects, foster alliances and encourage cooperation, especially in the priority areas of the partnership. In this spirit, MAPEO is also a means of communication through which the Foundation shares relevant information for the bi-regional dialogue, thus promoting the interest of the registered organisations to learn more about the opportunities and potential of such dialogue. If your organisation belongs to one of the following categories, we invite you to register it by following the steps below. An organisation refers to a legally constituted entity or institution with legal personality. MAPEO is updated regularly. Do not hesitate to contact us in order to put the relevant information about your organisation to date. For its part, the Foundation will contact the entities at least once a year to ensure that the information is updated and thus make of it a constantly useful tool at the service of the bi-regional partnership. Through the search engine tool you can filter the registered entities by the subject area in which they work, the region and country in which they are located, the type of organisation, and the services they provide.

Some of these events like Transport Day are recurring every year. For more information, please see www.slocat.net/ Monitoring and Impacts Sustainable Development Impact: Function of initiative Political dialogue Activity of initiative Advocacy Indicators Goals Sustainable transport is a cross-cutting theme in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It supports the achievement of at least 8 of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and makes direct and indirect contributions to at least 13 SDG targets. In addition, transport is directly related to five SDG indicators. The 2030 Agenda encourages member states to submit Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) to the United Nations High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), which has been convening annually since 2016 under the auspices of the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). The VNR process aims to facilitate the sharing of experiences among countries, including successes, challenges and lessons learned, with a view to accelerating the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. Since the first HLPF in 2016, the SLoCaT Partnershiphas been assessing transport references in the VNRs submitted each year. The assessment aims to: - Provide a useful resource for policy-makers to better understand the role of transport in achieving the SDGs; - Outline recommendations to policy-makers on goal-setting, implementing and reporting on sustainable transport progress; - Help the transport community (and other relevant sectors e.g. energy, health) better understand the pattern, gaps and opportunities in reporting sustainable transport in the VNR process.

In the coming years we will be focusing more on our targets and exploring the impact of digitization as a new thematic field. We see our role as helping to shape the processes of societal transformation. The new themes on which we will be working in future are Digital Society, Europe in the World, Climate Action, and Participation and Cohesion. In all these areas, an important role is played by questions relating to the transformation of social cohesion, the future of democracy and functioning multilateralism. Digital Society The process of digitization is not simply about providing society with new tools that allow things to continue as before. The contours of a fundamental shift in almost all areas of society have been highlighted, if they were not already evident beforehand, by the growing use of algorithmic systems. Stiftung Mercator plans to address this transformation in three respects over the coming years: it wants to support the adaptation of basic normative principles of social coexistence, it wants to defend democracy against the negative consequences of the digital society, and it wants to increase people’s ability and willingness to take part in public discourse. Europa in the World The continued existence of the European Union in the world depends on its degree of internal cohesion and on how it forges relationships with other countries. Stiftung Mercator promotes the European civic education of young people so that they are able to understand and help shape the EU. It is also committed to upholding the rule of law in the European Union. For many years, China and Turkey have been a focus in the foundation‘s work. The foundation still wants to better understand the actions of China and Turkey and the nature of their societies, and to organize formats for understanding that are as wide-ranging as possible with a view to promoting exchange and encounters with people from these countries. In future, Stiftung Mercator wishes to support the creation of knowledge and ideas about the role of Europe in the world, including about the future development of a rule-based international order. Climate Action Stiftung Mercator is committed to making Germany greenhouse gas-neutral by 2050. The foundation wants to help Germany and the EU assume a global leadership role in climate action. Stiftung Mercator sees the challenge as being not only to lower emissions as part of the climate revolution, but also to give economies impetus for innovation and growth, while at the same time reducing social inequality. To this end, the foundation plans to create a solid analytical basis. A more in-depth study is to be made in future of how climate change affects different areas of life, such as finance and health. Stiftung Mercator wishes to strengthen societal support for climate action by fostering exchange between climate action stakeholders and other groups in civil society that are affected by specific aspects of climate change. We will continue to promote fact-based media reporting in order to combat the polarization of public discourse. Participation and Cohesion Stiftung Mercator is committed to ensuring that everyone in Germany, regardless of their social or economic situation and their cultural or ethnic background, are given equal opportunities to access education and participate in society. To achieve this equality of opportunity, it is essential in the view of Stiftung Mercator to change the way diversity is handled in key areas of society and to give people the right to equal opportunity education. By encouraging people to embrace difference and diversity, and by promoting exchange and encounters between those of different backgrounds, the foundation wants to contribute to greater social cohesion. In addition, it supports the development of viable integration policy approaches at state and municipal levels that will make it easier for newly arrived migrants to settle, that will improve their access to the labour market, and will therefore enable them to participate in society.

The foundation started officiallyiin 1996, with a regional focus on the North Rhine-Westfalia region in Germany.In 2008, the foundation did a strategic review and has focused on three programmatic areas and three geographical areas. The review has has also resulted in substantial growth, an increase in budget and staff numbers. Today, it is one of the largest private foundations in Germany. Mission To prevent dangerous climate change, promote integration and strengthen arts, education, and to provide fair and equal opportunities so that everyone can participate in today’s society. Geographic Focus The foundation has, apart from its homeland Germany, three regional areas of focus, placing Germany in a globalised world; Europe, Turkey and China. Programme Areas The foundation’s motto is “inspiring ideas”, something which it achieves by combining advocacy and practical work around three areas: science and humanities, education and international affairs. Overarching these, the foundation has defined three interdisciplinary thematic clusters to further broaden its profile: • Integration • Climate change • Cultural education Integration Aims to reduce by 2025 the inequality in Germany in terms of school and university qualifications (based on the 2005 level) by 70% for young people of migrant background, aged 15-30. As an interim target, the foundation is working to reduce these discrepancies by 30% by 2015. Climate change Aims to reduce man-made greenhouse gas emissions in Germany by 40% by 2020 and by at least 80% by 2050, measured against the 1990 levels. Cultural education Aims to anchor cultural education permanently within the formal educational system in North Rhine-Westphalia and three other states in Germany by 2015, and in all of the country’s federal states by 2025.

It is organized into three centers: science and humanities; education; and international affairs. Mercator’s international interests focus mainly on pan-Europe, Turkey, and China. The foundation defines themes that cut across its work in all three centers, one of which is climate change. Grant Programs for Agriculture, Energy, Environment, Natural Resources Climate Change. The foundation supports actions in energy, transport, and land use that reduce human-caused emissions of greenhouse gases. The foundation focuses its actions for climate protection on Germany. However, it promotes an interest in climate protection at the pan-European level, and it supports broader international cooperation to prevent dangerous climate change. Particular interests are climate and culture, low-carbon future cities, and the intersection of climate change with international affairs — e.g., in relation to the foundation’s work with China. There is no minimum or maximum grant size. About the theme APPLICATION: Applicants read the foundation’s grant-making guidelines and submit applications in either German or English. German-based organizations may apply for funding for a project outside Germany.

We need to prepare ourselves for a future with more severe droughts and floods, with more unpredictable rainfall patterns and dramatically rising sea levels. Our best chance is to focus on smart, water-related solutions that build resilient societies and ecosystems whilst cutting greenhouse gas emissions and improving carbon storage. This is the next generation of climate solutions. Read more Cooperation Over Shared Waters Cooperation Over Shared Waters Regional cooperation on transboundary waters is a public good that benefits all parties and can open new opportunities for riparian states to sustainably develop water resources. SIWI helps basin actors to engage in transboundary processes with a long-term perspective of promoting both security and development, and encourages a holistic approach that includes the perspectives of other affected sectors. By employing tools such as modelling, SIWI enables decision makers to gain understanding of risks, benefits and opportunities associated with different strategies.

The Week attracts participants from more than 130 countries and consists of a broad array of parallel activities convened by leading international organizations on a broad array of water-related topics, ranging from food security and health to agriculture, technology, biodiversity, and the climate crisis. In 2021, World Water Week will be held in a new digital format so that people across the world can join, regardless of the circumstances. This will make World Water Week broader and more inclusive at a time when international cooperation is needed more than ever. The digital format makes it easier to welcome new stakeholders, who may not have a background in water. Another benefit is that the content produced can be revisited and reused also after the conference. In short, it takes us closer to our aim of being a year-round movement rather than a moment.

We work across the world to help countries, cities, and companies find smarter ways to manage and use water. Today’s SIWI is a world-leading water institute with an international team of advisors, researchers, and facilitators, active in many different fields of work. We trace our roots back to 1991 and the launch of the Stockholm Water Prize and the Stockholm Water Symposium. Three decades later, the Stockholm Water Prize is the world’s most prestigious water award and the symposium has evolved into World Water Week, the leading international water conference. SIWI runs a great number of projects and programmes from our offices in Stockholm, Bogotá, and Pretoria. We generate new knowledge and help bridge the gap between research and practice. In an era of rapid global warming and degraded ecosystems, our expertise is more important than ever. The best way to tackle water crises, and help bring about lasting change, is to strengthen water governance among public and private actors alike. With the competition over freshwater expected to intensify, we must ensure that both people and nature get their fair share. SIWI works actively to improve water management and support cooperation over shared water resources. As an independent, not-for-profit foundation, SIWI can bring together actors from different countries and sectors. We are a trusted and impartial facilitator of dialogues, also in sensitive contexts. SIWI hosts several flagship programmes, including the UNDP-SIWI Water Governance Facility, the International Centre for Water Cooperation (ICWC), the Action Platform for Source-to-Sea Management (S2S Platform), and the Alliance for Global Water Adaptation (AGWA). Through the Swedish Water House, we connect Swedish water stakeholders with each other and to international processes.

With over 33,000 students at four different faculties: law, humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences, it is one of the largest universities in Scandinavia. The institution is regarded as one of the top 100 universities in the world by the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU).[2] Stockholm University was granted university status in 1960, making it the fourth oldest Swedish university. As with other public universities in Sweden, Stockholm University's mission includes teaching and research anchored in society at large.[3] Contents 1 History 2 Organisation 2.1 Intra-university bodies 3 Departments, institutes and centers 4 Courses and programmes 5 Research 6 Field stations 7 Student unions 8 Rankings 9 Campus 10 Public transportation to Stockholm University 11 Notable people 11.1 Academics 11.2 Alumni 12 See also 13 References 14 External links History[edit] The initiative for the formation of Stockholm University was taken by the Stockholm City Council. The process was completed after a decision in December 1865 regarding the establishment of a fund and a committee to ""establish a higher education institution in the capital"".[4] The nine members of the Committee were respected and prominent citizens whose work had helped the evolution of science and society.[5] The next important step was taken in October 1869, when the Stockholm University College Association was established.[6] Several members of the committee became members of the association – including Professor Pehr Henrik Malmsten.[7] The association's mission was to establish a college in Stockholm and would ""not be dissolved until the college came into being and its future could be considered secure."" The memorandum of the Stockholm University College was adopted in May 1877, and in the autumn semester of the following year, actual operations began. In 1878, the university college Stockholms högskola started its operations with a series of lectures on natural sciences, open to curious citizens (a tradition still upheld by yearly publicly open lectures). Notable in the university's early history is the appointment of Sofia Kovalevskaya to hold a chair in the mathematics department in 1889, making her the third female professor in Europe. In 1904 the college became an official degree granting institution. Fredrik Blom's house at Experimentalfältet, now used for the central administration of Stockholm University In 1960, the college was granted university status, becoming Sweden's fourth state university. The university premises were situated in central Stockholm at Observatorielunden but increased enrollment resulted in a lack of space, which required the university campus to be shifted to a bigger facility. Since 1970 most of the university operations are located at the main campus at Frescati north of the city center, the former Experimentalfältet, previously used by the Royal Swedish Academy of Agriculture and Forestry. Organisation[edit] Stockholm University is a state agency and is governed by decisions taken by the government and parliament. The university has the right, within the limits the government provides, to decide on many issues such as their internal organization, educational provision and the admission of students. Intra-university bodies[edit] The University Board is the university's highest governing body. The board is responsible for the university's mission as a government agency and for following the requirements of laws and regulations. The board reports to the government. It consists of eight external members (including the Chairman and Vice-Chairman), four business representatives from the university with two group deputies and three student representatives (one graduate student representative) with one deputy. The University Board is above the rector who is the head of the agency and has operational responsibility for all operations. The rector has a pro rector to replace him/her if necessary. There are two area boards at the university, the Area board of science and the Area board of humanities, law and social sciences. They are headed by a vice rector. The area boards are responsible for strategic planning of education and research, coordination of faculty teaching, research and internal and external collaboration. After the area boards, the faculty boards are the highest decision-making bodies at the faculty level. The faculty boards consists of the dean, the assistant dean, other business representatives and student representatives. The deans are appointed by the president after proposal by choice within the faculty. After faculties, decisions are taken at the departmental level, where each department has a department head who manages and makes decisions together with the departmental board. The University administration is the preparation and service organization for the University Board, rector and other decision-making bodies, and it is led by the executive director. The University administration has a number of units, for example, finance department, IT department, HR department and the student section. There are also units for strategy, planning and communications. The Executive Director is the most senior official at Stockholm University and decides on matters including the university administration's organization and finances. Departments, institutes and centers[edit] Education and research at Stockholm University is carried out within the natural sciences and the humanities/social sciences. Within these fields, there are four faculties with 56 departments, institutes and centers within the humanities, law, natural sciences and social sciences. Research and training also takes place at a number of centers and institutes with a separate governing board, but that organisationally belong to a department.[8] Courses and programmes[edit] This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (August 2019) Stockholm University offers courses at both undergraduate[9] and advanced level.[10] There are 190 study programmes in total, including 75 master's programmes taught in English, and 1,700 courses to choose from within human science and science. Students can choose between studying one or more free-standing courses, that each may last between five weeks and one semester, or apply for a full study programme. Research[edit] The university's researchers engage in governmental investigations, are active in the media, provide responses to proposed legislation and are included in several Nobel committees and international expert bodies.[11] Field stations[edit] Askö Laboratory Stockholm University Marine Research center (SMF) provides ""Askö Laboratory"", where Research on ecosystems, ecology and the impact of human interference is carried out. The field station was built in 1961 by Professor Lars Silén, Head of the Department of Zoology, and is now established as a renowned marine research center.[12] Tarfala Tarfala research station belongs to the Department of Physical Geography. The station is located 1135 meters above sea level in Tarfaladalen, on the east side of Kebnekaise in arctic / alpine surroundings and conducts glaciological, hydrological, meteorological and climatological research. The station has the capacity to accommodate groups of up to 25 people and the staff consists of 2–5 people.[13] Tovetorp Tovetorp Zoological Research Station belongs to the Department of Zoology, and is located about 95 km southwest of Stockholm. It conducts research and training activities in ecology and ethology. Every year Tovetorp is visited by up to 600 students who live and study between 2–10 days on the station. On the research side, over 20 people work today with different research projects. The number of employees are currently 6 people.[14] Student unions[edit] Prior to 2008, Stockholm University had only one student union called Stockholm University Student Union (Stockholm universitets studentkår, SUS). However, since 2008 the computer and system science students[15] and the teacher students have their own, independent, student unions called DISK and ""The Teacher's College's Student Union"" (Lärarhögskolans studentkår). The law students also have their own student union, as do journalism students (Studentkåren vid JMK). The future of the Teacher's College's Student Union is however not entirely safe, as Stockholm University's Student Union has declared it will begin talks with the Teacher's College's Student Union on transferring its members to it, as it already has a teacher's division. In contrast to common belief, DISK is not an abbreviation.[16] Rankings[edit] University rankingsGlobal – OverallARWU World[17]69QS World[18]148THE World[19]134USNWR Global[20]114 In the Academic Ranking of World Universities 2020, an annual publication of university rankings by Shanghai Ranking Consultancy/Academic Ranking of World Universities, Stockholm University was placed as the 69th overall best university worldwide.[21] The Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings 2018 listed Stockholm University at position 134[22] on the list of the world's top universities. Times Higher Education World University Rankings are annual university rankings published by British Times Higher Education (THE) magazine.

In the CWTS Leiden Ranking 2014,[25] Stockholm University was placed at 140 on the list of universities in the world. Campus[edit] The main part of Stockholm University is in the Frescati area, which extends from the Bergius Botanical Garden in the north to Sveaplan in the south. It is located in the world's first national urban park and the area is characterized by nature, architecture and modern art, featuring such notable buildings as the Aula Magna (auditorium). Within Frescati, the areas Albano, the Bergius Botanical Garden, Frescati Backe, Frescati Hage, Kräftriket, Lilla Frescati and Sveaplan are located. The names of many of these areas have a history dating back to the late 1700s. After Gustav III's trip to Italy in 1783–84, several places at Brunnsviken were given Italian names. Stockholm University has another campus in Kista, which houses the Department of computer and systems sciences.[26] Public transportation to Stockholm University[edit] There are many ways to get to Stockholm University. The main campus Frescati is located near the underground railway station Universitetet metro station, on the red line of the Stockholm Metro. The commuter train line Roslagsbanan also stop close to the main campus, at Universitetet railway station. SL buses 50, 52, 540, 608, 624C, 628C, 639, 670, 676 och 680 can also be used to get to the campus. The Computer Science campus, Kista, also is close to an underground station called Kista. It is also located close to the pendeltåg station Helenelund, only one or two stops (depending on bus line) from the bus station Torsnäsgatan located next to the campus area.

With over 33,000 students at four different faculties: law, humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences, it is one of the largest universities in Scandinavia. The institution is regarded as one of the top 100 universities in the world by the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU).[2] Stockholm University was granted university status in 1960, making it the fourth oldest Swedish university. As with other public universities in Sweden, Stockholm University's mission includes teaching and research anchored in society at large.[3] Contents 1 History 2 Organisation 2.1 Intra-university bodies 3 Departments, institutes and centers 4 Courses and programmes 5 Research 6 Field stations 7 Student unions 8 Rankings 9 Campus 10 Public transportation to Stockholm University 11 Notable people 11.1 Academics 11.2 Alumni 12 See also 13 References 14 External links History[edit] The initiative for the formation of Stockholm University was taken by the Stockholm City Council. The process was completed after a decision in December 1865 regarding the establishment of a fund and a committee to ""establish a higher education institution in the capital"".[4] The nine members of the Committee were respected and prominent citizens whose work had helped the evolution of science and society.[5] The next important step was taken in October 1869, when the Stockholm University College Association was established.[6] Several members of the committee became members of the association – including Professor Pehr Henrik Malmsten.[7] The association's mission was to establish a college in Stockholm and would ""not be dissolved until the college came into being and its future could be considered secure."" The memorandum of the Stockholm University College was adopted in May 1877, and in the autumn semester of the following year, actual operations began. In 1878, the university college Stockholms högskola started its operations with a series of lectures on natural sciences, open to curious citizens (a tradition still upheld by yearly publicly open lectures). Notable in the university's early history is the appointment of Sofia Kovalevskaya to hold a chair in the mathematics department in 1889, making her the third female professor in Europe. In 1904 the college became an official degree granting institution. Fredrik Blom's house at Experimentalfältet, now used for the central administration of Stockholm University In 1960, the college was granted university status, becoming Sweden's fourth state university. The university premises were situated in central Stockholm at Observatorielunden but increased enrollment resulted in a lack of space, which required the university campus to be shifted to a bigger facility. Since 1970 most of the university operations are located at the main campus at Frescati north of the city center, the former Experimentalfältet, previously used by the Royal Swedish Academy of Agriculture and Forestry. Organisation[edit] Stockholm University is a state agency and is governed by decisions taken by the government and parliament. The university has the right, within the limits the government provides, to decide on many issues such as their internal organization, educational provision and the admission of students. Intra-university bodies[edit] The University Board is the university's highest governing body. The board is responsible for the university's mission as a government agency and for following the requirements of laws and regulations. The board reports to the government. It consists of eight external members (including the Chairman and Vice-Chairman), four business representatives from the university with two group deputies and three student representatives (one graduate student representative) with one deputy. The University Board is above the rector who is the head of the agency and has operational responsibility for all operations. The rector has a pro rector to replace him/her if necessary. There are two area boards at the university, the Area board of science and the Area board of humanities, law and social sciences. They are headed by a vice rector. The area boards are responsible for strategic planning of education and research, coordination of faculty teaching, research and internal and external collaboration. After the area boards, the faculty boards are the highest decision-making bodies at the faculty level. The faculty boards consists of the dean, the assistant dean, other business representatives and student representatives. The deans are appointed by the president after proposal by choice within the faculty. After faculties, decisions are taken at the departmental level, where each department has a department head who manages and makes decisions together with the departmental board. The University administration is the preparation and service organization for the University Board, rector and other decision-making bodies, and it is led by the executive director. The University administration has a number of units, for example, finance department, IT department, HR department and the student section. There are also units for strategy, planning and communications. The Executive Director is the most senior official at Stockholm University and decides on matters including the university administration's organization and finances. Departments, institutes and centers[edit] Education and research at Stockholm University is carried out within the natural sciences and the humanities/social sciences. Within these fields, there are four faculties with 56 departments, institutes and centers within the humanities, law, natural sciences and social sciences. Research and training also takes place at a number of centers and institutes with a separate governing board, but that organisationally belong to a department.[8] Courses and programmes[edit] This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (August 2019) Stockholm University offers courses at both undergraduate[9] and advanced level.[10] There are 190 study programmes in total, including 75 master's programmes taught in English, and 1,700 courses to choose from within human science and science. Students can choose between studying one or more free-standing courses, that each may last between five weeks and one semester, or apply for a full study programme. Research[edit] The university's researchers engage in governmental investigations, are active in the media, provide responses to proposed legislation and are included in several Nobel committees and international expert bodies.[11] Field stations[edit] Askö Laboratory Stockholm University Marine Research center (SMF) provides ""Askö Laboratory"", where Research on ecosystems, ecology and the impact of human interference is carried out. The field station was built in 1961 by Professor Lars Silén, Head of the Department of Zoology, and is now established as a renowned marine research center.[12] Tarfala Tarfala research station belongs to the Department of Physical Geography. The station is located 1135 meters above sea level in Tarfaladalen, on the east side of Kebnekaise in arctic / alpine surroundings and conducts glaciological, hydrological, meteorological and climatological research. The station has the capacity to accommodate groups of up to 25 people and the staff consists of 2–5 people.[13] Tovetorp Tovetorp Zoological Research Station belongs to the Department of Zoology, and is located about 95 km southwest of Stockholm. It conducts research and training activities in ecology and ethology. Every year Tovetorp is visited by up to 600 students who live and study between 2–10 days on the station. On the research side, over 20 people work today with different research projects. The number of employees are currently 6 people.[14] Student unions[edit] Prior to 2008, Stockholm University had only one student union called Stockholm University Student Union (Stockholm universitets studentkår, SUS). However, since 2008 the computer and system science students[15] and the teacher students have their own, independent, student unions called DISK and ""The Teacher's College's Student Union"" (Lärarhögskolans studentkår). The law students also have their own student union, as do journalism students (Studentkåren vid JMK). The future of the Teacher's College's Student Union is however not entirely safe, as Stockholm University's Student Union has declared it will begin talks with the Teacher's College's Student Union on transferring its members to it, as it already has a teacher's division. In contrast to common belief, DISK is not an abbreviation.[16] Rankings[edit] University rankingsGlobal – OverallARWU World[17]69QS World[18]148THE World[19]134USNWR Global[20]114 In the Academic Ranking of World Universities 2020, an annual publication of university rankings by Shanghai Ranking Consultancy/Academic Ranking of World Universities, Stockholm University was placed as the 69th overall best university worldwide.[21] The Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings 2018 listed Stockholm University at position 134[22] on the list of the world's top universities.

Campus[edit] The main part of Stockholm University is in the Frescati area, which extends from the Bergius Botanical Garden in the north to Sveaplan in the south. It is located in the world's first national urban park and the area is characterized by nature, architecture and modern art, featuring such notable buildings as the Aula Magna (auditorium). Within Frescati, the areas Albano, the Bergius Botanical Garden, Frescati Backe, Frescati Hage, Kräftriket, Lilla Frescati and Sveaplan are located. The names of many of these areas have a history dating back to the late 1700s. After Gustav III's trip to Italy in 1783–84, several places at Brunnsviken were given Italian names. Stockholm University has another campus in Kista, which houses the Department of computer and systems sciences.[26] Public transportation to Stockholm University[edit] There are many ways to get to Stockholm University. The main campus Frescati is located near the underground railway station Universitetet metro station, on the red line of the Stockholm Metro. The commuter train line Roslagsbanan also stop close to the main campus, at Universitetet railway station. SL buses 50, 52, 540, 608, 624C, 628C, 639, 670, 676 och 680 can also be used to get to the campus. The Computer Science campus, Kista, also is close to an underground station called Kista. It is also located close to the pendeltåg station Helenelund, only one or two stops (depending on bus line) from the bus station Torsnäsgatan located next to the campus area.

The University Board is above the rector who is the head of the agency and has operational responsibility for all operations. The rector has a pro rector to replace him/her if necessary. There are two area boards at the university, the Area board of science and the Area board of humanities, law and social sciences. They are headed by a vice rector. The area boards are responsible for strategic planning of education and research, coordination of faculty teaching, research and internal and external collaboration. After the area boards, the faculty boards are the highest decision-making bodies at the faculty level. The faculty boards consists of the dean, the assistant dean, other business representatives and student representatives. The deans are appointed by the president after proposal by choice within the faculty. After faculties, decisions are taken at the departmental level, where each department has a department head who manages and makes decisions together with the departmental board. The University administration is the preparation and service organization for the University Board, rector and other decision-making bodies, and it is led by the executive director. The University administration has a number of units, for example, finance department, IT department, HR department and the student section. There are also units for strategy, planning and communications. The Executive Director is the most senior official at Stockholm University and decides on matters including the university administration's organization and finances. Departments, institutes and centers[edit] Education and research at Stockholm University is carried out within the natural sciences and the humanities/social sciences. Within these fields, there are four faculties with 56 departments, institutes and centers within the humanities, law, natural sciences and social sciences. Research and training also takes place at a number of centers and institutes with a separate governing board, but that organisationally belong to a department.[8] Courses and programmes[edit] This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (August 2019) Stockholm University offers courses at both undergraduate[9] and advanced level.[10] There are 190 study programmes in total, including 75 master's programmes taught in English, and 1,700 courses to choose from within human science and science. Students can choose between studying one or more free-standing courses, that each may last between five weeks and one semester, or apply for a full study programme. Research[edit] The university's researchers engage in governmental investigations, are active in the media, provide responses to proposed legislation and are included in several Nobel committees and international expert bodies.[11] Field stations[edit] Askö Laboratory Stockholm University Marine Research center (SMF) provides ""Askö Laboratory"", where Research on ecosystems, ecology and the impact of human interference is carried out. The field station was built in 1961 by Professor Lars Silén, Head of the Department of Zoology, and is now established as a renowned marine research center.[12] Tarfala Tarfala research station belongs to the Department of Physical Geography. The station is located 1135 meters above sea level in Tarfaladalen, on the east side of Kebnekaise in arctic / alpine surroundings and conducts glaciological, hydrological, meteorological and climatological research. The station has the capacity to accommodate groups of up to 25 people and the staff consists of 2–5 people.[13] Tovetorp Tovetorp Zoological Research Station belongs to the Department of Zoology, and is located about 95 km southwest of Stockholm. It conducts research and training activities in ecology and ethology. Every year Tovetorp is visited by up to 600 students who live and study between 2–10 days on the station. On the research side, over 20 people work today with different research projects. The number of employees are currently 6 people.[14] Student unions[edit] Prior to 2008, Stockholm University had only one student union called Stockholm University Student Union (Stockholm universitets studentkår, SUS). However, since 2008 the computer and system science students[15] and the teacher students have their own, independent, student unions called DISK and ""The Teacher's College's Student Union"" (Lärarhögskolans studentkår). The law students also have their own student union, as do journalism students (Studentkåren vid JMK). The future of the Teacher's College's Student Union is however not entirely safe, as Stockholm University's Student Union has declared it will begin talks with the Teacher's College's Student Union on transferring its members to it, as it already has a teacher's division. In contrast to common belief, DISK is not an abbreviation.[16] Rankings[edit] University rankingsGlobal – OverallARWU World[17]69QS World[18]148THE World[19]134USNWR Global[20]114 In the Academic Ranking of World Universities 2020, an annual publication of university rankings by Shanghai Ranking Consultancy/Academic Ranking of World Universities, Stockholm University was placed as the 69th overall best university worldwide.[21] The Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings 2018 listed Stockholm University at position 134[22] on the list of the world's top universities.

With over 33,000 students at four different faculties: law, humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences, it is one of the largest universities in Scandinavia. The institution is regarded as one of the top 100 universities in the world by the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU).[2] Stockholm University was granted university status in 1960, making it the fourth oldest Swedish university. As with other public universities in Sweden, Stockholm University's mission includes teaching and research anchored in society at large.[3] Contents 1 History 2 Organisation 2.1 Intra-university bodies 3 Departments, institutes and centers 4 Courses and programmes 5 Research 6 Field stations 7 Student unions 8 Rankings 9 Campus 10 Public transportation to Stockholm University 11 Notable people 11.1 Academics 11.2 Alumni 12 See also 13 References 14 External links History[edit] The initiative for the formation of Stockholm University was taken by the Stockholm City Council. The process was completed after a decision in December 1865 regarding the establishment of a fund and a committee to ""establish a higher education institution in the capital"".[4] The nine members of the Committee were respected and prominent citizens whose work had helped the evolution of science and society.[5] The next important step was taken in October 1869, when the Stockholm University College Association was established.[6] Several members of the committee became members of the association – including Professor Pehr Henrik Malmsten.[7] The association's mission was to establish a college in Stockholm and would ""not be dissolved until the college came into being and its future could be considered secure."" The memorandum of the Stockholm University College was adopted in May 1877, and in the autumn semester of the following year, actual operations began. In 1878, the university college Stockholms högskola started its operations with a series of lectures on natural sciences, open to curious citizens (a tradition still upheld by yearly publicly open lectures). Notable in the university's early history is the appointment of Sofia Kovalevskaya to hold a chair in the mathematics department in 1889, making her the third female professor in Europe. In 1904 the college became an official degree granting institution. Fredrik Blom's house at Experimentalfältet, now used for the central administration of Stockholm University In 1960, the college was granted university status, becoming Sweden's fourth state university. The university premises were situated in central Stockholm at Observatorielunden but increased enrollment resulted in a lack of space, which required the university campus to be shifted to a bigger facility. Since 1970 most of the university operations are located at the main campus at Frescati north of the city center, the former Experimentalfältet, previously used by the Royal Swedish Academy of Agriculture and Forestry. Organisation[edit] Stockholm University is a state agency and is governed by decisions taken by the government and parliament. The university has the right, within the limits the government provides, to decide on many issues such as their internal organization, educational provision and the admission of students.

The coalition ran the I Count campaign in 2006–07 and organised The Wave, a campaign focused on the climatic impacts of energy production which took place on 5 December 2009, in the run up to the UN talks in Copenhagen. The coalition encourages individuals to lobby the government of the United Kingdom for what they see as positive policies on climate change. From 2005 to 2010 the director of the coalition was Ashok Sinha. There is also a Scottish secretariat called Stop Climate Chaos Scotland. Contents 1 The I Count Campaign 2 The Energy Campaign 3 The Wave 4 Lobby of MPs 5 Members 6 See also 7 References 8 External links The I Count Campaign[edit] The I Count campaign aimed to ensure that world leaders act on rising global greenhouse gas emissions in order to keep average global temperature increase to under 2 °C (3.6 °F) and so avoiding the more serious consequences of global warming. In 2006, the campaign focused on the lead up to the Queen's speech, urging the Government to introduce a Climate Change Bill in the forthcoming Parliamentary session, including legally binding cuts in emissions (3% per year and 50% by 2050), and an annual carbon budget. The I Count London Climate Change Rally was a demonstration in London on November 4, 2006. It was attended by 20,000 to 25,000 people and was timed to coincide with the release of the Stern Report, calling on the government to take more serious action to prevent damage from climate change. The event started with an initial rally at Grosvenor Square, outside the US Embassy, where George Monbiot, Caroline Lucas, and Norman Baker addressed the crowd. The rally marched to Trafalgar Square, joining with an already assembled crowd. The campaign then focussed on the contents of the Climate Change Bill and criticised the initial proposals as failing to take into account the 2 °C 'global warming danger threshold'.[1] The Energy Campaign[edit] At the end of 2008, with the climate change act through parliament, the coalition switched its attention to energy policy. The new campaign demands were for the government to boost investment in renewables and scrap plans for a string of coal power stations beginning with Kingsnorth. Via a pair of e actions on their website, thousands of emails were sent to Ed Miliband, Gordon Brown and campaigners' local MPs requesting energy policy is rethought. The coalition are also working with The Age of Stupid team on their Not Stupid campaign. The Wave[edit] On 5 December 2009, people from all walks of life gathered in London and Glasgow to mark the United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009 which took place in Copenhagen. The aim was to rally the British Government and other members of other parties in the United Kingdom to ‘Quit Dirty Coal’, ‘Protect the Poorest’ and ‘Act Fair & Fast’ to avoid the worst impacts of Climate Change. Reports of attendance vary from 40,000 to 60,000 people, which makes it the largest demonstration on climate change in the world to date. Lobby of MPs[edit] In November 2010, the coalition organised the ""Big Climate Connection"", a lobby of MPs regarding the Cancún climate summit and the forthcoming Energy Bill.

The Student Energy Leaders Fellowship is a 10-month online program designed to provide participants with leadership skills training, energy knowledge, connections to global leaders and young professionals, and the hands-on experience young people need to take action on climate and contribute to the growth of the clean economy. Show Details The Leaders program attracts youth from across the globe Past Leaders Fellows are well equipped to pursue energy projects in their communities Accelerating youth innovation The Leaders Fellowship program consists of online course work and mentoring sessions paired with experiential education through a project. The course is broken down into two tracks: Track 1 is the energy knowledge component of the program, where we teach young people about the current energy system, and the different systems that influence it; Track 2 focuses on leadership skills, and allows participants to learn and practice these skills in relation to their projects. Content Pages Within each monthly unit there will be a corresponding content page that will provide more insight to participants. Topic pages will provide an overview of the content, global trends, and dive-deeper resources. WEBINARS Webinars will be held monthly, and cover the topic of the month from Track 1, our energy knowledge track. Each webinar will include an interview with an experienced professional in the corresponding field. There will be a question-and-answer period during each webinar to ensure participants have the opportunity to ask specific questions relevant to their interests. The purpose is to give participants a closer look at what a career in the unit topic might look like, how it applies to their project, and to gain a deeper understanding of the current challenges in the field. COACHING AND PROJECT Coupled with the online learning, participants will be applying their new knowledge to a project. Student Energy will provide one-on-one coaching to each participating team to support them on their project. Fellows will be encouraged to take on projects that match their interest: from launching a business, to conducting research, to working with a company – the sky is the limit! 2021 Leaders Fellows Decolonizing Policies: Unlearning and Relearning at the wake of Clean Energy Transitions - Aarisha Vancouver, Canada Aarisha has a background in Political Science from the University of British Columbia. She felt there was a disconnect between academia and collective action until she found herself participating in a global seminar in Peru that introduced her to the concept of Rights of Nature– a concept which would later shape her passion for social and climate justice. Living and learning from the Indigenous Kichwa-Lamista community, that experience not only left an imprint moving forward with her activism, but also her way of life on how to hold space. Her project is inspired by many who has taught her about the environmental movement, and shehopes to learn what it means to decolonize the current systems in place through policy writing. Through reflection, Aarisha believes reconciliation is the most important key in creating a sustainable transition and combating the impacts of climate change. With that, this project aims to bridge knowledge gaps in energy transition, and mobilize communities about the urgency of climate action while highlighting the intersections of environmental, social and economic issues of communities who are often burdened with the impacts of climate change.

Student Energy impact stories Our History Student Energy started with a spark. Three driven students, passionate about energy, found that young people like themselves had no space to engage directly with the decision-makers and influential leaders who were determining their energy future. It took just one ambitious idea: an international conference where young people set the agenda, led the discussions, and asked the questions, bringing together hundreds of youth passionate about energy and some of the world’s most influential energy leaders. Since this first International Student Energy Summit took place in 2009, Student Energy has expanded into a global organization. Our co-founders Janice Tran, Kali Taylor, and Sean Collins take you through the history of how Student Energy became a global organization, starting from the first International Student Energy Summit in Calgary in 2009 to where we are today. Student Energy has now expanded its programming to offer a groundbreaking digital Energy System Map that has reached over 3 million visitors, empowered thousands of youth through post-secondary level Student Energy Chapters, and hosted six youth-led international Summits. The International Student Energy Summit is now the largest forum in the world for students on energy, and in 2019, we held our largest Summit yet, bringing together 650 students from over 100 countries, more than double our numbers from year one. This growing movement of students is Student Energy’s greatest success story, with over 50,000 students from over 120 countries engaged in our programs. Our alumni have gone on to develop and implement renewable energy technologies, run for political office, advise the United Nations, and work with the largest energy companies on the planet to push for a clean energy future.

The topics identified as ‘Influences’ are also are areas where young people can take action to transform the energy system – for example, by developing innovative policy mechanisms, pursuing careers in research and technology development, or working with their peers to build public support for climate action. Climate Change Energy Justice Energy Policy Sustainable Development Goals Source This is the category of natural resources, both renewable and non-renewable, that can be converted into forms of usable energy. Generally, energy sources are grouped into three categories – fossil fuels, alternative energy, and renewables. Fossil fuels refer to resources created by thousands of years of heat and pressure on prehistoric organisms. Alternative energy refers to any form of energy that is not a fossil fuel; this includes renewables and nuclear energy. Renewable energy refers to sources of energy that can be replenished in a human lifetime. These categories are further broken down into individual sources like oil, coal, wind, solar, hydro and nuclear that require specific and unique processes to be converted into usable forms of energy. Energy Alternative Energy Energy Efficiency Fossil Fuel Energy Renewable Energy Biomass Coal Geothermal Hydrogen Natural Gas Nuclear Oil Solar Water Wind Conventional Gas Conventional Oil Hydro Power Tidal Power Unconventional Gas Unconventional Oil Arctic Oil Coal Bed Methane Enhanced Oil Recovery Gas Hydrates Heavy Oil Offshore Gas Offshore Oil Oil Sands Oil Shale Shale Gas Tight Oil Production Production refers to the methods used to get an energy source into a state where it can be converted into a usable form of energy. For natural resources found in the Earth, this generally involves exploration, extraction and basic processing of the resource. For other resources such as hydrogen, production may involve a chemical process to obtain the element in its pure form. Many renewable resources, such as wind and solar, skip production processes because they undergo direct conversion into a usable form of energy. Drilling Electrolysis Hydraulic Fracturing In Situ In Situ Gasification Mining Oil Sands Mining Steam Methane Reforming Upgrading Conversion Conversion refers to the processes that convert an energy resource into a usable form of energy. Energy is only consumed in a few major forms – such as electricity or transportation fuels. Our infrastructure – such as our grid or the internal combustion engine – is built around these forms of energy and therefore resources must be converted to be consumed. Biodigestion Coal Liquefaction Fission Fusion Gasification Power Plant Pyrolysis Refining Solar PV Solar Thermal Waste to Energy Cogeneration Combined Cycle Fuel Cell Gas Turbine Steam Turbine Form Form refers to the states energy has been converted to so that it can be efficiently utilized for its end use. Energy can neither be created nor destroyed; it simply changes form. Raw natural resources must be converted to usable forms of energy so that they can be consumed to perform work. Biochar Electricity Refined Products Biofuels Transport Transport refers to the various methods for moving energy resources from where they are produced to where they are converted. Resource transportation is most common for fossil fuels because they are seldom produced and converted in the same location. Natural Gas Transport Oil Transport Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Natural Gas Storage Oil Storage Distribution Distribution refers to the various technologies that enable the delivery of usable energy forms to the places where they will be consumed. Once a natural resource has been converted into a usable form of energy it needs to be delivered to consumers. The electric grid is our largest piece of energy distribution infrastructure. Electrical Grid Transport Fuels Energy Storage Smart Grid Use Use is the service that people acquire from energy. Ultimately, the reason our energy system exists is so that our society can benefit from the services energy enables. Energy allows us to transport ourselves efficiently from point A to point B, stay warm in cold months or cool in hot months, have light and power to run our various home appliances; the list could go on and on. Energy is the ability to do work and therefore use can be thought of as all the ways in which energy allows us to do work.

Of this total, 19 million hectares are Protected Areas (PAs) state. However, the creation of a PA for sustainable use does not in itself guarantee environmental preservation, requiring a number of other initiatives, including management, supervision, and, most importantly, to add value for its forest assets, providing economic incentive for keeping it standing. The lack of job opportunities and income generation makes the forest felling one of the livelihood strategies in the region, which makes it necessary to implement programs and projects that provide sustainable economic alternatives to the inhabitants in order to reduce deforestation pressures. In this context, an effective strategy is to develop an economy based on products derived from sustainable forest management. The Bolsa Floresta Program (PBF), run by FAS since 2007, contributes to facilitate this strategy, through payments for environmental services (sustainable natural resources management, conservation and environmental protection) and products to traditional communities, in order to encourage voluntary deforestation reduction. The program has four components: Income, Association, Family and Social. The Bolsa Floresta Income Program is directed to the generation of sustainable economic alternatives for the local population, from support for small enterprises and development of clusters. The Bolsa Floresta Association program supports the strengthening of local associations and training for the management of collective enterprises. The Bolsa Floresta Family component is a monthly credit, currently R $ 50.00, paid directly to mothers of riverine families living in protected areas. The beneficiary family is committed not to open new areas from primary forest; keep their children in school; and participate in associations and training workshops on climate change and environmental services. Finally, the Bolsa Floresta Social component includes investments in education, health, communication and transportation, from demands of the local population. The support from the Amazon Fund is directed to Income and Association programs. THE PROJECT The ""Bolsa Floresta Program +"" supports in 16 PAs of sustainable use in the state of Amazonas: the continuity of actions under component Bolsa Floresta Income through training in good sustainable management practices and direct investment (equipment, works and installations) to increase the production of small community enterprises. It will also be supported actions that contribute to better integration in the market for products and services for sustainable production arrangements in the region, such as: preparation of business plans, product development and certification, and technical assistance; the strengthening of associations representing PAs under the Bolsa Floresta Association component, through financial support both for structural actions (repairs at headquarters, equipment purchase), and for organizing meetings and other expenses necessary for the decisions and the management of investments be taken collectively; the management of the knowledge accumulated by FAS and the communities in implementing solutions for sustainable development in the Amazon. These actions aim to systematize and disseminate good practices and lessons learned for the various stakeholders interested in the subject, turning it into public knowledge in order to replicate the actions in other locations. Technical and scientific publications on sustainable production arrangements will be supported, including evaluations of social and economic impacts of investments in income generation. Seminars around the theme will be held, allowing the appropriation of this knowledge by academia, government and third sector. It will also supported the spread of this knowledge to the inhabitants of the region covered by the project, through dissemination actions, radio spots, workshops, community forums and discussion circles; and the implementation of a public call, in order to support small and medium sustainable productive community-based projects in the regions surrounding the protected areas included in the project and at the ecological corridors in the state of Amazonas.

This participatory process prioritized the acquisition of equipment to increase added value of production and facilitate the marketing of a variety of products, in addition to training producers in good management and production practices. Some of the actions undertaken include: Workshops on good management and handling and processing of Brazil nuts; License maintenance of ten small-scale timber forest management plans in the Rio Negro Sustainable Development Reserve (SDR) and filing of three others in the Rio Amapá SDR; Purchase of equipment and support for training, logistics and market access for vegetable oils and cocoa production chains; Building of floating bases for pirarucu fishing and support for the establishment of processing (fish dryer) and freezing facilities (cold rooms and freezing tunnel), in addition to support for the holding of fishing fairs; Support for guarana production and recovery of guarana groves, purchase of agricultural machinery and implements, as well as the structuring of a guarana processing plant; Provision of management and entrepreneurship training for craft and tourism small entrepreneurs of the Rio Negro and Mamirauá SDRs, aiming to increase access to new consumer markets; Purchase of inputs and provision of technical assistance for family farmers of products such as bananas, watermelons and small-scale livestock farming; Provision of training and support for structuring actions aimed at improving the management and commercialization of flour, such as obtaining the Origens Brasil seal for Farinha Ribeirinha. Within the scope of the Forest Assistance Program’s Association component, leadership training workshops and meetings of community leaders were held, and support was provided for community assemblies, board meetings and for lectures and seminars aimed at the sharing of experiences and training. FAS also concluded the Standing Forest Public Call, which selected 17 projects, prepared by community associations and cooperatives and focusing on sustainable productive activities, to receive up to R$ 150,000 each. Three seminars on good business management practices were held, aimed at supporting 11 different production chains. The seminars’ results will be reported in a publication called “Standing Forest Public Call: Results and Dissemination of Good Practices.” The knowledge generated by the FAP+ will also be systematized in the series “Sustainable Solutions,” which will address all priority production chains and include a collection of videos and technical pieces, which will be made available before the project’s completion at http://fas-amazonas.org/fundoamazonia.

It provides direct financial assistance and indirect support to the residents of sustainable use protected areas of Brazil in exchange for their engaging in conservation measures. Contents 1 History 2 Participation 3 Program components 4 Replacement of the program 5 Notes 6 Sources History[edit] The Amazonas Sustainability Foundation (Fundação Amazonas Sustentável: FAS) is a private NGO based in Manaus, Amazonas, that promotes environmental conservation through sustainable development in state conservation units. It is a partnership between the government of the state of Amazonas and Banco Bradesco.[1] The FAS was created in December 2007 to manage environmental products and services from State conservation units, and manage the Bolsa Floresta program.[2] It is funded by affiliated NGOs, government bodies and private individuals and enterprises. Most of the funding comes from private sources such as Coca-Cola, Samsung, Grupo Abril and Marriott International.[3] The Bolsa Floresta[a] Program (Programa Bolsa Floresta: PBF) has its origins in the Zona Franca Verde initiatives launched in 2003 by The Amazonas State Secretariat of the Environment and Sustainable Development (SDS) to promote sustainable use of natural resources in order to increase the environmental benefits of the forests.[3] The SDS initiated the program in September 2007 and assigned it to the FAS in March 2008.[4] Bolsa Floresta is the main FAS program.[1] The main funding comes from Bradesco and the Amazon Fund, which is supported by the Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES) and the Government of Norway.[3] Deforestation is monitored annually by the FAS, SDS, and analysis of satellite images by partner organisations.[5] Participation[edit] The Bolsa Floresta program, which is voluntary, involves families living along the rivers within state-run conservation units in Amazonas. The initial focus on conservation units is due to the availability of an existing legal framework. It is planned is to later extend the program to other areas.[2] The formal income of most of the eligible families would place them at the extreme poverty level. However, this is raised considerably after accounting for the value of slash-and-burn cultivation of cassava, hunting, fishing and collection of forest products.[6] The program provides social benefits and support for community associations in return for participation in workshops on environmental services, commitment not to open new areas of cultivation in the primary forest, and permanent enrolment of children in school. The basic goal is to improve the quality of life by valuing the standing forest.[4] Bolsa Floresta imposes slightly more stringent rules than those set out in the conservation unit management plans. The family must join the reserve association and pay the association fee, must send their children to school, cannot increase the area under cultivation and can only clear secondary growth for crop rotation.[7] However, enrolment in Bolsa Floresta by eligible families is close to 100%.[8] By the end of 2008, the program covered the Uatumã, Mamirauá, Piagaçu-Purus, Uacari and Cujubim sustainable development reserves and the Catuá-Ipixuna Extractive Reserve. There were plans to extend the program by 2010 to also include Maués State Forest, the Amanã, Juma, Rio Madeira, and Rio Amapá sustainable development reserves and the Rio Gregório Extractive Reserve.[9] As of 2016 the program was operating in fifteen conservation units covering a total of more than 100,000 square kilometres (39,000 sq mi). Of these the Juma Sustainable Development Reserve was a certified REDD+ initiative and the other fourteen were in the REDD+ readiness phase.[10] Program components[edit] The program has four components: income, family, association and social. The income component of the program supports sustainable income-generation activities including local processing of products to add value, ecotourism, fish farming, natural honey production and breeding of small livestock.[8] The family component gives a small monthly payment of R$50 (US$30) to each household in exchange for a commitment to preserve the forest.[6] The stipend is paid to the mothers of families who live in conservation units as a reward for conserving the forest.[11] The association component provides funds to associations of residents of the reserves, who may freely decide how they want to use the funds.[6] The association component, which aims to strengthen community organisation and control of the program, is equal to about 10% of the family component.[11] The social component, coordinated with government institutions, improves education, sanitation, health, communications and transport infrastructure.[8] Health is seen as an essential part of the program, since the other benefits have limited value if not accompanied by improved health. The program works with other state and private organisations to improve health among the Bolsa Floresta participants.[9] Malaria, diarrhea, influenza and helminthiasis (worm infection) together make up about 95% of diseases in Bolsa Floresta conservation units. The FAS is involved in training health care workers in ways of preventing these diseases, and in developing plans for each conservation unit.[12] For example, distribution of sachets for purifying water in Rio Gregório Extractive Reserve in 2015 resulted in a drastic drop in cases of diarrhea.[13] Replacement of the program[edit] In 2018, it was replaced by a new program called ""Programa Floresta em Pé"" (""Standing Forests"").[14] Notes[edit] ^ Bolsa Floresta may be translated ""Forest Allowance"". ^ a b Riyong Kim Bakkegaard & Sven Wunder 2014, pp. 57. ^ a b Virgilio M.

She is a member of the Academy of Management. Partners University of South Australia provides funding as a member of The Conversation AU. View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger More than half of Australian companies plan to scale back environmental initiatives to weather the financial harm caused by the COVID pandemic, a report released this month suggests. But such a move would be bad for business, and the planet. Over the past few decades, regulatory and societal pressures have prompted businesses to adopt environmental initiatives at a growing rate. The measures may involve divesting from fossil fuels, preventing pollution, developing eco-friendly products or even collaborating with competitors to help other organisations in their supply chains, such as distributors and retailers, become sustainable. My research focuses on social and environmental sustainability issues confronting organisations. Environmental initiatives require a long-term focus, and in my view, businesses would be unwise to scale back these measures in response to the pandemic. Research by myself and colleagues suggests most firms with good environmental performance also do well financially. And firms that ignore environmental issues face enormous risk. Renowned US economist Milton Friedman famously argued, “the only social responsibility of business is to make profits”. But even Friedman suggests firms are better off dealing with environmental issues when they become a risk. Climate change and extreme weather, such as heavy rainfall, is a business risk. Flooded supermarket carpark Business can be a force for good Sustainability measures by business are crucial in helping mitigate and adapt to climate change. Production processes creating fewer greenhouse gas emissions help slow global warming. And when firms make products that require fewer natural resources (such as by using recycled materials), this lowers stress on global ecosystems. In fact, our research shows businesses can be one of society’s most powerful actors in bringing about fast and furious change on environmental and social sustainability. However a recent international survey by Deloitte found 54% of 75 surveyed Australian companies were downgrading sustainability initiatives during the pandemic. This is a troubling figure, but below the global average of 65%. And, it should be noted, no surveyed organisation planned to stop their efforts completely and not resume, indicating the changes will not be permanent. The results are not necessarily representative of the entire Australian business sector. But as a general rule, slowing the momentum on environmental initiatives increases business exposure to climate risk – and may affect future profitability. A firm’s environmental capabilities can take decades to hone. They can involve complex strategies and years of consultations inside and outside the company. Stopping or slowing these actions can undo hard-earned gains. Slowing the momentum on environmental initiatives increases business exposure to climate risk. Shutterstock In recent years, the business community has increasingly recognised how climate change and other environmental damage poses a risk to their returns. These risks include: extreme weather which disrupts operations, damages infrastructure and increases insurance costs increased business costs due to scarcer resources lower consumer demand for unsustainable products stranded assets (those that can’t make a financial return due to changes in technology, regulation or the market) reputation damage and shareholder backlash. Read more: Cyclone Seroja just demolished parts of WA – and our warming world will bring more of the same Rio Tinto experienced the latter last year after its disastrous decision to blow up two ancient rock shelters at Juukan Gorge. The move prompted public outrage and enraged shareholders forced the resignation of Rio’s chief executive, Jean-Sébastien Jacques. And shareholders in Australian energy giant AGL have urged its board to hasten the closure of its coal-fired power stations. Sustainable business activities need not damage a business’ financial returns. This month it was reported that BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, had examined divestment by hundreds of funds and concluded the portfolios experienced “modest improvement in fund return”. Protesters rally outside the Rio Tinto office in Perth earlier this year. RICHARD WAINWRIGHT/AAP Flattening the climate curve Rather than abandoning environmental initiatives, governments, businesses and societies should use the pandemic to reset our collective response to climate change. For businesses, the pandemic presents a unique opportunity to rethink how they engage with their workforce. Do businesses really need all their energy-guzzling office buildings? Do their employees need to commute to work every day? Is international travel necessary? Can they pool scarce resources and work with competitors to gain traction on environmental issues? For governments, this is a good time to seriously consider pricing carbon, which financially penalises high-emitting companies. Renewable energy is becoming more reliable each year – strengthening the case to move to a low-carbon economy. Governments should also consider earmarking a decent fraction of further stimulus payments to encourage business action on climate change. After the global financial crisis in 2007-09, many national governments issued financial stimulus to kickstart economies. Pioneering electric carmaker Tesla emerged from one such stimulus loan in the United States. And more broadly, as a capitalist society, must we continue on the path of incessant economic growth that is making our planet sick? Or can we use the pause caused by this pandemic to take a more sustainable route? Read more: I've seriously tried to believe capitalism and the planet can coexist, but I've lost faith The pandemic is a time to question the mantra of endless economic growth. Dean Lewins/AAP A dry run The COVID-19 pandemic can be viewed as a dry run for the impending climate crisis. But the size and scale of climate change demands much more sustained commitment and action than the pandemic. Successfully flattening the emissions curve will take decades, not months. And the pain from climate change, while slower to arrive, will last much longer, and perhaps forever change civilisation as we know it. Businesses have long been a big part of the climate problem. They, along with governments and society, cannot continue their uncoordinated, piecemeal response to climate change. This includes not dumping environmental initiatives when it all feels too hard.

Vienna is Austria's most populous city, with about 2 million inhabitants[9] (2.6 million within the metropolitan area,[10] nearly one third of the country's population), and its cultural, economic, and political centre. It is the 6th-largest city by population within city limits in the European Union. Until the beginning of the 20th century, Vienna was the largest German-speaking city in the world, and before the splitting of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in World War I, the city had 2 million inhabitants.[11] Today, it is the second-largest German-speaking city after Berlin.[12][13] Vienna is host to many major international organizations, including the United Nations, OPEC and the OSCE. The city is located in the eastern part of Austria and is close to the borders of the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. These regions work together in a European Centrope border region. Along with nearby Bratislava, Vienna forms a metropolitan region with 3 million inhabitants. In 2001, the city center was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In July 2017 it was moved to the list of World Heritage in Danger.[14] Additionally, Vienna is known as the ""City of Music""[15] due to its musical legacy, as many famous classical musicians such as Beethoven and Mozart called Vienna home. Vienna is also said to be the ""City of Dreams"", because of it being home to the world's first psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud.[16] Vienna's ancestral roots lie in early Celtic and Roman settlements that transformed into a Medieval and Baroque city. It is well known for having played a pivotal role as a leading European music center, from the age of Viennese Classicism through the early part of the 20th century. The historic center of Vienna is rich in architectural ensembles, including Baroque palaces and gardens, and the late-19th-century Ringstraße lined with grand buildings, monuments and parks.[17] Vienna is known for its high quality of life. In a 2005 study of 127 world cities, the Economist Intelligence Unit ranked the city first (in a tie with Vancouver and San Francisco) for the world's most livable cities. Between 2011 and 2015, Vienna was ranked second, behind Melbourne.[18] Monocle's 2015 ""Quality of Life Survey"" ranked Vienna second on a list of the top 25 cities in the world ""to make a base within.""[19] Monocle's 2012 ""Quality of Life Survey"" ranked Vienna fourth on a list of the top 25 cities in the world ""to make a base within"" (up from sixth in 2011 and eighth in 2010).[20] The UN-Habitat classified Vienna as the most prosperous city in the world in 2012/2013.[21] The city was ranked 1st globally for its culture of innovation in 2007 and 2008, and sixth globally (out of 256 cities) in the 2014 Innovation Cities Index, which analyzed 162 indicators in covering three areas: culture, infrastructure, and markets.[22][23][24] Vienna regularly hosts urban planning conferences and is often used as a case study by urban planners.[25] Between 2005 and 2010, Vienna was the world's number-one destination for international congresses and conventions.[26] It attracts over 6.8 million tourists a year.[27] Contents 1 Etymology 2 History 2.1 Early history 2.2 Austrian Empire and the early 20th century 2.3 Anschluss and World War II 2.4 Four-power Vienna 2.5 Austrian State Treaty and afterwards 3 Demographics 3.1 Religion 4 Geography 4.1 Climate 5 World heritage in danger 6 Districts and enlargement 7 Politics 7.1 Political history 7.2 Government 8 Economy 8.1 Research and development 8.2 Information technologies 8.3 Tourism and conferences 9 Rankings 10 Urban development 10.1 Central Railway Station 10.2 Aspern 10.3 Smart City 11 Culture 11.1 Music, theater and opera 11.2 Actors from Vienna 11.3 Musicians from Vienna 11.4 Notable Jewish cultural figures from Vienna 11.5 Notable writers from Vienna 11.6 Notable politicians from Vienna 11.7 Museums 11.8 Architecture 11.9 Vienna balls 11.10 Language 12 Education 12.1 Universities 12.2 International schools 13 Leisure activities 13.1 Parks and gardens 13.2 Sport 14 Culinary specialities 14.1 Food 14.2 Drinks 14.3 Viennese cafés 15 Tourist attractions 16 Transportation 17 Viennese 18 International relations 18.1 International organizations in Vienna 18.2 Charitable organizations in Vienna 18.3 International city cooperations 18.4 District to district partnerships 19 See also 20 References 21 Further reading 22 External links 22.1 Official websites 22.2 History of Vienna 22.3 Further information on Vienna Etymology[edit] See also Other names of Vienna The English name Vienna is borrowed from the homonymous Italian name. The etymology of the city's name is still subject to scholarly dispute. Some claim that the name comes from vedunia, meaning ""forest stream"", which subsequently produced the Old High German uuenia (wenia in modern writing), the New High German wien and its dialectal variant wean.[28] Others believe that the name comes from the Roman settlement name of Celtic extraction Vindobona, probably meaning ""fair village, white settlement"" from Celtic roots, vindo-, meaning ""bright"" or ""fair"" – as in the Irish fionn and the Welsh gwyn –, and -bona ""village, settlement"".[29] The Celtic word vindos may reflect a widespread prehistorical cult of Vindos, a Celtic deity who survives in Irish Mythology as the warrior and seer Fionn mac Cumhaill. A variant of this Celtic name could be preserved in the Czech, Slovak and Polish names of the city (Vídeň, Viedeň and Wiedeń respectively) and in that of the city's district Wieden.[30] The name of the city in Hungarian (Bécs), Serbo-Croatian (Beč; Cyrillic: Беч) and Ottoman Turkish (Beç) has a different, probably Slavonic origin, and originally referred to an Avar fort in the area.[31] Slovene-speakers call the city Dunaj, which in other Central European Slavic languages means the river Danube, on which the city stands. History[edit] Main articles: History of Vienna and Timeline of Vienna Early history[edit] Depiction of Vienna in the Nuremberg Chronicle, 1493 Vienna in 1683 Evidence has been found of continuous habitation in the Vienna area since 500 BC, when Celts settled the site on the Danube.[citation needed] In 15 BC, the Romans fortified the frontier city they called Vindobona to guard the empire against Germanic tribes to the north. Close ties with other Celtic peoples continued through the ages. The Irish monk Saint Colman (or Koloman, Irish Colmán, derived from colm ""dove"") is buried in Melk Abbey and Saint Fergil (Virgil the Geometer) served as Bishop of Salzburg for forty years. Irish Benedictines founded twelfth-century monastic settlements; evidence of these ties persists in the form of Vienna's great Schottenstift monastery (Scots Abbey), once home to many Irish monks. Vienna from Belvedere by Bernardo Bellotto, 1758 In 976, Leopold I of Babenberg became count of the Eastern March, a district centered on the Danube on the eastern frontier of Bavaria. This initial district grew into the duchy of Austria. Each succeeding Babenberg ruler expanded the march east along the Danube, eventually encompassing Vienna and the lands immediately east. In 1145, Duke Henry II Jasomirgott moved the Babenberg family residence from Klosterneuburg in Lower Austria to Vienna. From that time, Vienna remained the center of the Babenberg dynasty.[32] In 1440, Vienna became the resident city of the Habsburg dynasty. It eventually grew to become the de facto capital of the Holy Roman Empire (800–1806) in 1437 and a cultural center for arts and science, music and fine cuisine. Hungary occupied the city between 1485 and 1490. In the 16th and 17th centuries Christian forces twice stopped Ottoman armies outside Vienna, in the 1529 Siege of Vienna and the 1683 Battle of Vienna. The Great Plague of Vienna ravaged the city in 1679, killing nearly a third of its population.[33] Austrian Empire and the early 20th century[edit] Vienna's Ringstraße and the State Opera in around 1870 In 1804, during the Napoleonic Wars, Vienna became the capital of the newly formed Austrian Empire. The city continued to play a major role in European and world politics, including hosting the Congress of Vienna in 1814/15. After the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, Vienna remained the capital of what became the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The city functioned as a center of classical music, for which the title of the First Viennese School (Haydn/Mozart/Beethoven) is sometimes applied. Colour lithograph of Vienna, 1900 During the latter half of the 19th century, Vienna developed what had previously been the bastions and glacis into the Ringstraße, a new boulevard surrounding the historical town and a major prestige project. Former suburbs were incorporated, and the city of Vienna grew dramatically. In 1918, after World War I, Vienna became capital of the Republic of German-Austria, and then in 1919 of the First Republic of Austria. From the late-19th century to 1938, the city remained a center of high culture and of modernism. A world capital of music, Vienna played host to composers such as Brahms, Bruckner, Mahler and Richard Strauss. The city's cultural contributions in the first half of the 20th century included, among many, the Vienna Secession movement in art, psychoanalysis, the Second Viennese School (Schoenberg, Berg, Webern), the architecture of Adolf Loos and the philosophy of Ludwig Wittgenstein and the Vienna Circle. In 1913 Adolf Hitler, Leon Trotsky, Josip Broz Tito, Sigmund Freud and Joseph Stalin all lived within a few kilometres of each other in central Vienna, some of them becoming regulars at the same coffeehouses.[34] Austrians came to regard Vienna as a center of socialist politics, sometimes referred to as ""Red Vienna""(“Das rote Wien”). In the Austrian Civil War of 1934 Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss sent the Austrian Army to shell civilian housing such as the Karl Marx-Hof occupied by the socialist militia. Anschluss and World War II[edit] Main article: Anschluss Crowds greet Adolf Hitler as he rides in an open car through Vienna in March 1938 In 1938, after a triumphant entry into Austria, the Austrian-born German Chancellor Adolf Hitler spoke to the Austrian Germans from the balcony of the Neue Burg, a part of the Hofburg at the Heldenplatz. In the ensuing days the new Nazi authorities oversaw the harassment of Viennese Jews, the looting of their homes, and their on-going deportation and murder.[35][need quotation to verify][36] Between 1938 (after the Anschluss) and the end of the Second World War in 1945, Vienna lost its status as a capital to Berlin, because Austria ceased to exist and became part of Nazi Germany. During the November pogroms on November 9, 1938, 92 synagogues in Vienna were destroyed. Only the city temple in the 1st district was spared, as the data of all Jews in Vienna were collected in the adjacent archives. Adolf Eichmann held office in the expropriated Palais Rothschild and organized the expropriation and persecution of the Jews. Of the almost 200,000 Jews in Vienna, around 120,000 were driven to emigrate and around 65,000 were killed. After the end of the war, the Jewish population of Vienna was about only 5,000.[37][38][39][40] Vienna was also the center of the important resistance group around Heinrich Maier, which provided the Allies with plans for V-1, V-2 rockets, Peenemünde, Tiger tanks, Messerschmitt Bf 109, Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet and other aircraft. The information was important to Operation Crossbow and Operation Hydra, both preliminary missions for Operation Overlord. In addition, factory locations for war-essential products were communicated as targets for the Allied Air Force. The group was exposed and most of its members were executed after months of torture by the Gestapo in Vienna.[41][42][43][44] The group around the later executed Karl Burian even tried to blow up the Gestapo headquarters in the Hotel Metropole.[45] On 2 April 1945 the Soviet Red Army launched the Vienna Offensive against the Germans holding the city and besieged it. British and American air-raids, as well as artillery duels between the Red Army and the SS and Wehrmacht, crippled infrastructure, such as tram services and water- and power-distribution, and destroyed or damaged thousands of public and private buildings. The Red Army was helped by an Austrian resistance group in the German Wehrmacht. The group tried under the code name Radetzky to prevent the destruction and fighting in the city. Vienna fell eleven days later.[46] At the end of the war, Austria again became separated from Germany, and Vienna regained its status as the capital city of the Republic of Austria, but the Soviet hold[citation needed] on the city remained until 1955, when Austria regained full sovereignty. Four-power Vienna[edit] Further information: Allied-occupied Austria Occupation zones in Vienna, 1945–55 After the war, Vienna was part of Soviet-occupied Eastern Austria until September 1945. As in Berlin, Vienna in September 1945 was divided into sectors by the four powers: the US, the UK, France, and the Soviet Union and supervised by an Allied Commission. The four-power occupation of Vienna differed in one key respect from that of Berlin: the central area of the city, known as the first district, constituted an international zone in which the four powers alternated control on a monthly basis. The control was policed by the four powers on a de facto day-to-day basis, the famous ""four soldiers in a jeep"" method.[47] The Berlin Blockade of 1948 raised Western concerns that the Soviets might repeat the blockade in Vienna. The matter was raised in the UK House of Commons by MP Anthony Nutting, who asked: ""What plans have the Government for dealing with a similar situation in Vienna? Vienna is in exactly a similar position to Berlin.""[48] There was a lack of airfields in the Western sectors, and authorities drafted contingency plans to deal with such a blockade. Plans included the laying down of metal landing mats at Schönbrunn. The Soviets did not blockade the city. The Potsdam Agreement included written rights of land access to the western sectors, whereas no such written guarantees had covered the western sectors of Berlin. Also, there was no precipitating event to cause a blockade in Vienna. (In Berlin, the Western powers had introduced a new currency in early 1948 to economically freeze out the Soviets.) During the 10 years of the four-power occupation, Vienna became a hotbed for international espionage between the Western and Eastern blocs. In the wake of the Berlin Blockade, the Cold War in Vienna took on a different dynamic. While accepting that Germany and Berlin would be divided, the Soviets had decided against allowing the same state of affairs to arise in Austria and Vienna. Here, the Soviet forces controlled districts 2, 4, 10, 20, 21, and 22 and all areas incorporated into Vienna in 1938. Barbed wire fences were installed around the perimeter of West Berlin in 1953, but not in Vienna. By 1955, the Soviets, by signing the Austrian State Treaty, agreed to relinquish their occupation zones in Eastern Austria as well as their sector in Vienna. In exchange they required that Austria declare its permanent neutrality after the allied powers had left the country. Thus they ensured that Austria would not be a member of NATO and that NATO forces would therefore not have direct communications between Italy and West Germany. The atmosphere of four-power Vienna is the background for Graham Greene's screenplay for the film The Third Man (1949). Later he adapted the screenplay as a novel and published it. Occupied Vienna is also depicted in the 1991 Philip Kerr novel, A German Requiem. Austrian State Treaty and afterwards[edit] Vienna in 1966 The four-power control of Vienna lasted until the Austrian State Treaty was signed in May 1955. That year, after years of reconstruction and restoration, the State Opera and the Burgtheater, both on the Ringstraße, reopened to the public. The Soviet Union signed the State Treaty only after having been provided with a political guarantee by the federal government to declare Austria's neutrality after the withdrawal of the allied troops. This law of neutrality, passed in late October 1955 (and not the State Treaty itself), ensured that modern Austria would align with neither NATO nor the Soviet bloc, and is considered one of the reasons for Austria's delayed entry into the European Union in 1995. In the 1970s, Austrian Chancellor Bruno Kreisky inaugurated the Vienna International Center, a new area of the city created to host international institutions. Vienna has regained much of its former international stature by hosting international organizations, such as the United Nations (United Nations Industrial Development Organization, United Nations Office at Vienna and United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime), the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization, the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.

In 1910, Vienna had more than two million inhabitants, and was the third largest city in Europe after London and Paris.[51] Around the start of the 20th century, Vienna was the city with the second-largest Czech population in the world (after Prague).[52] After World War I, many Czechs and Hungarians returned to their ancestral countries, resulting in a decline in the Viennese population. After World War II, the Soviets used force to repatriate key workers of Czech, Slovak and Hungarian origins to return to their ethnic homelands to further the Soviet bloc economy.[citation needed] Under the Nazi regime, 65,000 Jews were deported and murdered in concentration camps by Nazi forces; approximately 130,000 fled.[53] By 2001, 16% of people living in Austria had nationalities other than Austrian, nearly half of whom were from former Yugoslavia;[54][55] the next most numerous nationalities in Vienna were Turks (39,000; 2.5%), Poles (13,600; 0.9%) and Germans (12,700; 0.8%).[56] As of 2012[update], an official report from Statistics Austria showed that more than 660,000 (38.8%) of the Viennese population have full or partial migrant background, mostly from Ex-Yugoslavia, Turkey, Germany, Poland, Romania and Hungary.[9][57] From 2005 to 2015 the city's population grew by 10.1%.[58] According to UN-Habitat, Vienna could be the fastest growing city out of 17 European metropolitan areas until 2025 with an increase of 4.65% of its population, compared to 2010.[59] Religion[edit] Karlskirche, located on the south side of Karlsplatz in the 4th city district According to the 2001 census, 49.2% of Viennese were Catholic, while 25.7% were of no religion, 7.8% were Muslim, 6.0% were members of an Eastern Orthodox Christian denomination, 4.7% were Protestant (mostly Lutheran), 0.5% were Jewish and 6.3% were either of other religions or did not reply.[56] A 2011 report by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis showed the proportions had changed, with 41.3% Catholic, 31.6% no affiliation, 11.6% Muslim, 8.4% Eastern Orthodox, 4.2% Protestant, and 2.9% other.[60] Based on information provided to city officials by various religious organizations about their membership, Vienna's Statistical Yearbook 2019 reports in 2018 an estimated 610,269 Roman Catholics, or 32.3% of the population, and 195,000 (10.3%) Muslims, 70,298 (3.7%) Orthodox, 57,502 (3.0%) other Christians, and 9,504 (0.5%) other religions.[61] A study conducted by the Vienna Institute of Demography estimated the 2018 proportions to be 34% Catholic, 30% unaffiliated, 15% Muslim, 10% Orthodox, 4% Protestant, and 6% other religions.[62] Vienna is the seat of the Metropolitan Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Vienna, in which is also vested the exempt Ordinariate for Byzantine-rite Catholics in Austria; its Archbishop is Cardinal Christoph Schönborn. Many Catholic churches in central Vienna feature performances of religious or other music, including masses sung to classical music and organ. Some of Vienna's most significant historical buildings are Catholic churches, including the St. Stephen's Cathedral (Stephansdom), Karlskirche, Peterskirche and the Votivkirche. On the banks of the Danube, there is a Buddhist Peace Pagoda, built in 1983 by the monks and nuns of Nipponzan Myohoji. Geography[edit] Satellite image of Vienna (2018) Vienna is located in northeastern Austria, at the easternmost extension of the Alps in the Vienna Basin. The earliest settlement, at the location of today's inner city, was south of the meandering Danube while the city now spans both sides of the river. Elevation ranges from 151 to 542 m (495 to 1,778 ft). The city has a total area of 414.65 square kilometers (160.1 sq mi), making it the largest city in Austria by area. Climate[edit] Vienna has an oceanic climate (Köppen classification Cfb). The city has warm summers, with periodical precipitations that can reach its yearly peak in July and August (66.6 and 66.5 mm respectively) and average high temperatures from June to September of approximately 21 to 27 °C (70 to 81 °F), with a record maximum exceeding 38 °C (100 °F) and a record low in September of 5.6 °C (42 °F). Winters are relatively dry and cold with average temperatures at about freezing point. Spring is variable and autumn cool, with possible snowfalls already in November. Precipitation is generally moderate throughout the year, averaging around 550 mm (21.7 in) annually, with considerable local variations, the Vienna Woods region in the west being the wettest part (700 to 800 mm (28 to 31 in) annually) and the flat plains in the east being the driest part (500 to 550 mm (20 to 22 in) annually). Snow in winter is common, even if not so frequent compared to the Western and Southern regions of Austria.

The main reason was a planned high-rise development.[73] The city's social democratic party planned construction of a 6,500 square metres (70,000 sq ft) complex in 2019.[73] The plan includes a 66.3 metres (218 ft)-high tower, which was reduced from 75 metres (246 ft) due to opposition.[73] UNESCO believed that the project ""fails to comply fully with previous committee decisions, notably concerning the height of new constructions, which will impact adversely the outstanding universal value of the site.""[73] UNESCO set the restriction for the height of the construction in the city center to 43 metres (141 ft).[73] The citizens of Vienna also opposed the construction of the complex because they are afraid of losing UNESCO status and also of encouraging future high-rise development.[73] The city officials replied that they will convince the WHC to maintain UNESCO world heritage status and said that no further high-rise developments are being planned.[73] UNESCO is concerned about the height of high-rise development in Vienna as it can dramatically influence the visual integrity of the city,[74] specifically the baroque palaces.[74] Visual impact studies are being done in the Vienna city center to assess the level of visual disturbance to visitors and how the changes influenced the city's visual integrity.[74] Districts and enlargement[edit] Main article: Districts of Vienna Map of the districts of Vienna with numbers Vienna is composed of 23 districts (Bezirke). Administrative district offices in Vienna (called Magistratische Bezirksämter) serve functions similar to those in the other Austrian states (called Bezirkshauptmannschaften), the officers being subject to the mayor of Vienna; with the notable exception of the police, which is under federal supervision. District residents in Vienna (Austrians as well as EU citizens with permanent residence here) elect a District Assembly (Bezirksvertretung). City hall has delegated maintenance budgets, e.g., for schools and parks, so that the districts are able to set priorities autonomously. Any decision of a district can be overridden by the city assembly (Gemeinderat) or the responsible city councilor (amtsführender Stadtrat). Albertina Terrace in the Innere Stadt The heart and historical city of Vienna, a large part of today's Innere Stadt, was a fortress surrounded by fields in order to defend itself from potential attackers. In 1850, Vienna with the consent of the emperor annexed 34 surrounding villages,[75] called Vorstädte, into the city limits (districts no. 2 to 8, after 1861 with the separation of Margareten from Wieden no. 2 to 9). Consequently, the walls were razed after 1857,[76] making it possible for the city center to expand. In their place, a broad boulevard called the Ringstraße was built, along which imposing public and private buildings, monuments, and parks were created by the start of the 20th century. These buildings include the Rathaus (town hall), the Burgtheater, the University, the Parliament, the twin museums of natural history and fine art, and the Staatsoper. It is also the location of New Wing of the Hofburg, the former imperial palace, and the Imperial and Royal War Ministry finished in 1913. The mainly Gothic Stephansdom is located at the center of the city, on Stephansplatz. The Imperial-Royal Government set up the Vienna City Renovation Fund (Wiener Stadterneuerungsfonds) and sold many building lots to private investors, thereby partly financing public construction works. The Ring Road (Ringstraße) with a historical tram From 1850 to 1890, city limits in the West and the South mainly followed another wall called Linienwall at which a road toll called the Liniengeld was charged. Outside this wall from 1873 onwards a ring road called Gürtel was built. In 1890 it was decided to integrate 33 suburbs (called Vororte) beyond that wall into Vienna by 1 January 1892[77] and transform them into districts no. 11 to 19 (district no. 10 had been constituted in 1874); hence the Linienwall was torn down beginning in 1894.[78] In 1900, district no. 20, Brigittenau, was created by separating the area from the 2nd district. From 1850 to 1904, Vienna had expanded only on the right bank of the Danube, following the main branch before the regulation of 1868–1875, i.e., the Old Danube of today. In 1904, the 21st district was created by integrating Floridsdorf, Kagran, Stadlau, Hirschstetten, Aspern and other villages on the left bank of the Danube into Vienna, in 1910 Strebersdorf followed. On 15 October 1938 the Nazis created Great Vienna with 26 districts by merging 97 towns and villages into Vienna, 80 of which were returned to surrounding Lower Austria in 1954.[77] Since then Vienna has had 23 districts. Industries are located mostly in the southern and eastern districts. The Innere Stadt is situated away from the main flow of the Danube, but is bounded by the Donaukanal (""Danube canal""). Vienna's second and twentieth districts are located between the Donaukanal and the Danube. Across the Danube, where the Vienna International Center is located (districts 21–22), and in the southern areas (district 23) are the newest parts of the city. Politics[edit] Political history[edit] The Debating Chamber of the former House of Deputies of Austria in the parliament In the twenty years before the First World War and until 1918, Viennese politics were shaped by the Christian Social Party. In particular, long-term mayor Karl Lueger was able to not apply the general voting rights for men introduced by and for the parliament of imperial Austria, the Reichsrat, in 1907, thereby excluding most of the working class from taking part in decisions. For Adolf Hitler, who spent some years in Vienna, Lueger was a teacher of how to use antisemitism in politics. Vienna is today considered the center of the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ). During the period of the First Republic (1918–1934), the Vienna Social Democrats undertook many social reforms. At that time, Vienna's municipal policy was admired by Socialists throughout Europe, who therefore referred to the city as ""Red Vienna"" (Rotes Wien). In February 1934 troops of the Austrian federal government under Engelbert Dollfuss, who had closed down the first chamber of the federal parliament, the Nationalrat, in 1933, and paramilitary socialist organizations were engaged in the Austrian Civil War, which led to the ban of the Social Democratic party. The SPÖ has held the mayor's office and control of the city council/parliament at every free election since 1919. The only break in this SPÖ dominance came between 1934 and 1945, when the Social Democratic Party was illegal, mayors were appointed by the austro-fascist and later by the Nazi authorities. The mayor of Vienna is Michael Ludwig of the SPÖ. The city has enacted many social democratic policies. The Gemeindebauten are social housing assets that are well integrated into the city architecture outside the first or ""inner"" district. The low rents enable comfortable accommodation and good access to the city amenities. Many of the projects were built after the Second World War on vacant lots that were destroyed by bombing during the war. The city took particular pride in building them to a high standard. Government[edit] Main article: Gemeinderat and Landtag of Vienna Interior of Vienna's historical Rathaus, the seat of city mayor Since Vienna obtained federal state (Bundesland) status of its own by the federal constitution of 1920, the city council also functions as the state parliament (Landtag), and the mayor (except 1934–1945) also doubles as the Landeshauptmann (governor/minister-president) of the state of Vienna. The Rathaus accommodates the offices of the mayor (de:Magistrat der Stadt Wien) and the state government (Landesregierung). The city is administered by a multitude of departments (Magistratsabteilungen), politically supervised by amtsführende Stadträte (members of the city government leading offices; according to the Vienna constitution opposition parties have the right to designate members of the city government not leading offices). Under the city constitution of 1920, municipal and state business must be kept separate. Hence, the city council and state parliament hold separate meetings, with separate presiding officers–the chairman of the city council or the president of the state Landtag–even though the two bodies' memberships are identical. When meeting as a city council, the deputies can only deal with the affairs of the city of Vienna; when meeting as a state parliament, they can only deal with the affairs of the state of Vienna. In the 1996 City Council election, the SPÖ lost its overall majority in the 100-seat chamber, winning 43 seats and 39.15% of the vote. The SPÖ had held an outright majority at every free municipal election since 1919. In 1996 the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ), which won 29 seats (up from 21 in 1991), beat the ÖVP into third place for the second time running. From 1996 to 2001, the SPÖ governed Vienna in a coalition with the ÖVP. In 2001 the SPÖ regained the overall majority with 52 seats and 46.91% of the vote; in October 2005, this majority was increased further to 55 seats (49.09%). In course of the 2010 city council elections the SPÖ lost their overall majority again and consequently forged a coalition with the Green Party – the first SPÖ/Green coalition in Austria.[79] This coalition was maintained following the 2015 election. Economy[edit] Messe Wien Congress Center Austria Center Vienna (ACV) Vienna is one of the wealthiest regions in the European Union: Its gross regional product of EUR 47,200 per capita constituted 25.7% of Austria's GDP in 2013. It amounts to 159% of the EU average.[80] The city improved its position from 2012 on the ranking of the most economically powerful cities reaching number nine on the listing in 2015.[81][82] With a share of 85.5% in gross value added, the service sector is Vienna's most important economic sector. Industry and commerce have a share of 14.5% in gross value added, the primary sector (agriculture) has a share of 0.07% and therefore plays a minor role in the local added value.[83] However, the cultivation and production of wines within the city borders have a high socio-cultural value. The most important business sectors are trade (14.7% of added value in Vienna), scientific and technological services, real estate and housing activities as well as manufacturing of goods. In 2012, Vienna's contribution in Austria's outgoing and incoming foreign direct investments was of about 60%, which demonstrates Vienna's role as an international hub for domestic and foreign companies.[83] Since the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989, Vienna has expanded its position as gateway to Eastern Europe: 300 international companies have their Eastern European headquarters in Vienna and its environs. Among them are Hewlett Packard, Henkel, Baxalta and Siemens.[84] Companies in Vienna have extensive contacts and competences in business with Eastern Europe due to the city's historical role as center of the Habsburg Empire.[85] The number of international businesses in Vienna is still growing: In 2014 159 and in 2015 175 international firms established offices in Vienna.[86] Altogether, approximately 8,300 new companies have been founded in Vienna every year since 2004.[87] The majority of these companies are operating in fields of industry-oriented services, wholesale trade as well as information and communications technologies and new media.[88] Vienna makes effort to establish itself as a start-up hub. Since 2012, the city hosts the annual Pioneers Festival, the largest start-up event in Central Europe with 2,500 international participants taking place at Hofburg Palace. Tech Cocktail, an online portal for the start-up scene, has ranked Vienna sixth among the top ten start-up cities worldwide.[89][90][91] Research and development[edit] The city of Vienna attaches major importance to science and research and focuses on creating a positive environment for research and development. In 2014, Vienna has accommodated 1,329 research facilities; 40,400 persons are employed in the R&D sector and 35% of Austria's R&D expenses are invested in the city. With a research quota of 3.4% Vienna exceeds the Austrian average of 2.77% and has already met the EU target of 3.0% by 2020.[83] A major R&D sector in Vienna are life sciences. The Vienna Life Science Cluster is Austria's major hub for life science research, education and business. Throughout Vienna, five universities and several basic research institutes form the academic core of the hub with more than 12,600 employees and 34,700 students. Here, more than 480 medical device, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies with almost 23,000 employees generate around 12 billion euros in revenue (2017). This corresponds to more than 50% of the revenue generated by life science companies in Austria (22.4 billion euros).[92][93] Vienna is home to global players like Boehringer Ingelheim, Octapharma, Ottobock and Takeda.[94] However, there is also a growing number of start-up companies in the life sciences and Vienna was ranked first in the 2019 PeoplePerHour Startup Cities Index.[95] Companies such as Apeiron Biologics, Hookipa Pharma, Marinomed, mySugr, Themis Bioscience and Valneva operate a presence in Vienna and regularly hit the headlines internationally.[96] To facilitate tapping the economic potential of the multiple facettes of the life sciences at Austria's capital, the Austrian Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs and the local government of City of Vienna have joined forces: Since 2002, the LISAvienna platform is available as a central contact point. It provides free business support services at the interface of the Austrian federal promotional bank, Austria Wirtschaftsservice and the Vienna Business Agency and collects data that inform policy making.[97] The main academic hot spots in Vienna are the Life Science Center Muthgasse with the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences (BOKU), the Austrian Institute of Technology, the University of Veterinary Medicine, the AKH Vienna with the MedUni Vienna and the Vienna Biocenter.[98] Central European University, a graduate institution expelled from Budapest in the midst of a Hungarian government steps to take control of academic and research organizations, welcomes the first class of students to its new Vienna campus in 2019.[99] Information technologies[edit] The Viennese sector for information and communication technologies is comparable in size with the sector in Helsinki, Milan or Munich and thus among Europe's largest IT locations. In 2012 8,962 IT businesses with a workforce of 64,223 were located in the Vienna Region. The main products are instruments and appliances for measuring, testing and navigation as well as electronic components. More than ⅔ of the enterprises provide IT services. Among the biggest IT firms in Vienna are Kapsch, Beko Engineering & Informatics, air traffic control experts Frequentis, Cisco Systems Austria, Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft Austria, IBM Austria and Samsung Electronics Austria.[100][101] The US technology corporation Cisco runs its Entrepreneurs in Residence program for Europe in Vienna in cooperation with the Vienna Business Agency.[102][103] The British company UBM has rated Vienna one of the Top 10 Internet Cities worldwide, by analyzing criteria like connection speed, WiFi availability, innovation spirit and open government data.[104] In 2011 74.3% of Viennese households were connected with broadband, 79% were in possession of a computer. According to the broadband strategy of the city, full broadband coverage will be reached by 2020.[100][101] Tourism and conferences[edit] There were 17.6 million overnight stays in Vienna in 2019 (+6.8% compared to 2018). The top ten incoming markets in 2019 were Germany, Austria, the United States, Italy, United Kingdom, Spain, China, France, Russia and Switzerland.[105] In 2019 the International Congress and Convention Association (ICCA) ranked Vienna 6th in the world for association meetings.[106] The Union of International Associations (UIA) ranked Vienna 5th in the world for 2019 with 306 international meetings, behind Singapore, Brussels, Seoul and Paris.[107] The city's largest conference center, the Austria Center Vienna (ACV) has a total capacity for around 22,800 people and is situated next to the United Nations Headquarters in Vienna.[108] Other centers are the Messe Wien Exhibition & Congress Center (up to 3,000 people) and the Hofburg Palace (up to 4,900 people). Rankings[edit] Vienna was ranked top in the 2019 Quality of Living Ranking by the international Mercer Consulting Group for the tenth consecutive year.[109] In the 2015 liveability report by the Economist Intelligence Unit as well as in the Quality of Life Survey 2015 of London-based Monocle magazine Vienna was equally ranked second most livable city worldwide.[110][111] The United Nations Human Settlements Programme UN-Habitat has ranked Vienna the most prosperous city in the world in its flagship report State of the World Cities 2012/2013.[112] According to the 2014 City RepTrack ranking by the Reputation Institute, Vienna has the best reputation in comparison with 100 major global cities.[113] The Innovation Cities Global Index 2014 by the Australian innovation agency 2thinknow ranks Vienna sixth behind San Francisco-San Jose, New York City, London, Boston and Paris.[114] In 2019 PeoplePerHour put Vienna at the top of their Startup Cities Ranking.[115] US climate strategist Boyd Cohen placed Vienna first in his first global smart cities ranking of 2012. In the 2014 ranking, Vienna reached third place among European cities behind Copenhagen and Amsterdam.[116] The Mori Memorial Institute for Urban Strategies ranked Vienna in the top ten of their Global Power City Index 2016.[117] Urban development[edit] “HoHo Wien” in January 2020 Central Railway Station[edit] Vienna's new Central Railway Station was opened in October 2014.[118] Construction began in June 2007 and was due to last until December 2015. The station is served by 1,100 trains with 145,000 passengers. There is a shopping center with approximately 90 shops and restaurants. In the vicinity of the station a new district is emerging with 550,000 m2 (5,920,000 sq ft) office space and 5,000 apartments until 2020.[119][120][121] Aspern[edit] Seestadt Aspern is one of the largest urban expansion projects of Europe. A 5 hectare artificial lake, offices, apartments and a subway station within walking distance are supposed to attract 20,000 new citizens when construction is completed in 2028.[122][123] In addition, the highest wooden skyscraper in the world, “HoHo Wien”, will be built within 3 years, starting in 2015.[124] Smart City[edit] In 2014, the Vienna City Council adopted the Smart City Wien Framework Strategy 2050. It is a long-term umbrella strategy that is supposed to establish a conducive, long-term and structural framework in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from 3.1 tonnes per capita to 1 tonne per capita by 2050, have 50% of Vienna's gross energy consumption originate from renewable sources and to reduce motorized individual traffic from the current 28% to 15% by 2030. A stated goal is that, by 2050, all vehicles within the municipal boundaries will run without conventional propulsion technologies. Additionally, Vienna aims to be one of the five biggest European research and innovation hubs in 2050.[125] Culture[edit] Music, theater and opera[edit] See also: Music of Vienna and Music of Austria Monument of Johann Strauss II at Stadtpark, Vienna Famous composers including Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Joseph Haydn, Ludwig van Beethoven, Ferdinand Ries, Franz Schubert, Johannes Brahms, Gustav Mahler, Robert Stolz, and Arnold Schoenberg have worked in Vienna. Art and culture had a long tradition in Vienna, including theater, opera, classical music and fine arts. The Burgtheater is considered one of the best theaters in the German-speaking world alongside its branch, the Akademietheater. The Volkstheater Wien and the Theater in der Josefstadt also enjoy good reputations. There is also a multitude of smaller theaters, in many cases devoted to less mainstream forms of the performing arts, such as modern, experimental plays or cabaret. State Opera (Staatsoper) Vienna is also home to a number of opera houses, including the Theater an der Wien, the Staatsoper and the Volksoper, the latter being devoted to the typical Viennese operetta. Classical concerts are performed at venues such as the Wiener Musikverein, home of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra known across the world for the annual widely broadcast ""New Year's Day Concert"", as well as the Wiener Konzerthaus, home of the internationally renowned Vienna Symphony. Many concert venues offer concerts aimed at tourists, featuring popular highlights of Viennese music, particularly the works of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Johann Strauss I, and Johann Strauss II. Hofburg Palace Musikverein Vienna Up until 2005, the Theater an der Wien hosted premieres of musicals, but since 2006 (a year dedicated to the 250th anniversary of Mozart's birth), has devoted itself to opera again, becoming a stagione opera house offering one new production each month. Since 2012, Theater an der Wien has taken over the Wiener Kammeroper, a historical small theater in the first district of Vienna seating 300 spectators, turning it into its second venue for smaller sized productions and chamber operas created by the young ensemble of Theater an der Wien (JET). Before 2005 the most successful musical was Elisabeth, which was later translated into several languages and performed all over the world. The Wiener Taschenoper is dedicated to stage music of the 20th and 21st century. The Haus der Musik (""house of music"") opened in the year 2000. The Wienerlied is a unique song genre from Vienna. There are approximately 60,000 – 70,000 Wienerlieder.[126] In 1981 the popular British new romantic group Ultravox paid a tribute to Vienna on an album and an artful music video recording called Vienna. The inspiration for this work arose from the cinema production called The Third Man with the title Zither music of Anton Karas. The Vienna's English Theatre (VET) is an English theater in Vienna. It was founded in 1963 and is located in the 8th Vienna's district. It is the oldest English-language theater in continental Europe. In May 2015, Vienna hosted the Eurovision Song Contest following Austria's victory in the 2014 contest.

Museums[edit] See also: List of museums in Vienna Courtyard of the Museumsquartier with Enzi seating furniture Leopold Museum The Hofburg is the location of the Imperial Treasury (Schatzkammer), holding the imperial jewels of the Habsburg dynasty. The Sisi Museum (a museum devoted to Empress Elisabeth of Austria) allows visitors to view the imperial apartments as well as the silver cabinet. Directly opposite the Hofburg are the Kunsthistorisches Museum, which houses many paintings by old masters, ancient and classical artifacts, and the Naturhistorisches Museum. Liechtenstein Museum A number of museums are located in the Museumsquartier (museum quarter), the former Imperial Stalls which were converted into a museum complex in the 1990s. It houses the Museum of Modern Art, commonly known as the MUMOK (Ludwig Foundation), the Leopold Museum (featuring the largest collection of paintings in the world by Egon Schiele, as well as works by the Vienna Secession, Viennese Modernism and Austrian Expressionism), the AzW (museum of architecture), additional halls with feature exhibitions, and the Tanzquartier. The Liechtenstein Palace contains much of one of the world's largest private art collections, especially strong in the Baroque. The Belvedere, built under Prince Eugene, has a gallery containing paintings by Gustav Klimt (The Kiss), Egon Schiele, and other painters of the early 20th century, also sculptures by Franz Xaver Messerschmidt, and changing exhibitions too. There are a multitude of other museums in Vienna, including the Albertina, the Military History Museum, the Technical Museum, the Burial Museum, the Museum of Art Fakes, the KunstHausWien, Museum of Applied Arts, the Sigmund Freud Museum, and the Mozarthaus Vienna. The museums on the history of the city, including the former Historical Museum of the City of Vienna on Karlsplatz, the Hermesvilla, the residences and birthplaces of various composers, the Museum of the Romans, and the Vienna Clock Museum, are now gathered together under the group umbrella Vienna Museum. The Jewish Museum Vienna, founded 1896, is the oldest of its kind. In addition there are museums dedicated to Vienna's individual districts. They provide a record of individual struggles, achievements and tragedy as the city grew and survived two world wars. For readers seeking family histories these are good sources of information. Architecture[edit] See also: Category:Buildings and structures in Austria Hotel Sacher A variety of architectural styles can be found in Vienna, such as the Romanesque Ruprechtskirche and the Baroque Karlskirche. Styles range from classicist buildings to modern architecture. Art Nouveau left many architectural traces in Vienna. The Secession building, Karlsplatz Stadtbahn Station, and the Kirche am Steinhof by Otto Wagner rank among the best known examples of Art Nouveau in the world. Wagner's prominent student Jože Plečnik from Slovenia also left important traces in Vienna. His works include the Langer House (1900) and the Zacherlhaus (1903–1905). Plečnik's 1910–1913 Church of the Holy Spirit (Heilig-Geist-Kirche [de]) in Vienna is remarkable for its innovative use of poured-in-place concrete as both structure and exterior surface, and also for its abstracted classical form language. Most radical is the church's crypt, with its slender concrete columns and angular, cubist capitals and bases. Concurrent to the Art Nouveau movement was the Wiener Moderne, during which some architects shunned the use of extraneous adornment. A key architect of this period was Adolf Loos, whose works include the Looshaus (1909), the Kärntner Bar or American Bar (1908) and the Steiner House (1910). The Hundertwasserhaus by Friedensreich Hundertwasser, designed to counter the clinical look of modern architecture, is one of Vienna's most popular tourist attractions. Another example of unique architecture is the Wotrubakirche by sculptor Fritz Wotruba. In the 1990s, a number of quarters were adapted and extensive building projects were implemented in the areas around Donaustadt (north of the Danube) and Wienerberg (in southern Vienna). View of the city from Stephansdom The 220-meter high DC Tower 1 located on the Northern bank of the Danube, completed in 2013, is the tallest skyscraper in Vienna.[128][129] In recent years, Vienna has seen numerous architecture projects completed which combine modern architectural elements with old buildings, such as the remodeling and revitalization of the old Gasometer in 2001. Most buildings in Vienna are relatively low; in early 2006 there were around 100 buildings higher than 40 metres (130 feet). The number of high-rise buildings is kept low by building legislation aimed at preserving green areas and districts designated as world cultural heritage. Strong rules apply to the planning, authorization and construction of high-rise buildings. Consequently, much of the inner city is a high-rise free zone. Vienna balls[edit] Vienna is the last great capital of the 19th-century ball. There are over 450 balls per year, some featuring as many as nine live orchestras.[130] Balls are held in the many palaces in Vienna, with the principal venue being the Hofburg Palace in Heldenplatz. While the Opera Ball is the best known internationally of all the Austrian balls, other balls such as the Kaffeesiederball (Cafe Owners Ball), the Jägerball (Hunter's Ball) and the Life Ball (AIDS charity event) are almost as well known within Austria and even better appreciated for their cordial atmosphere. Viennese of at least middle class may visit a number of balls in their lifetime.[clarification needed] Dancers and opera singers from the Vienna State Opera often perform at the openings of the larger balls. A Vienna ball is an all-night cultural attraction. Major Vienna balls generally begin at 9 pm and last until 5 am, although many guests carry on the celebrations into the next day. Viennese balls are being exported (with support from the City of Vienna) to around 30 cities worldwide such as New York, Barcelona, Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, Rome, Prague, Bucharest, Berlin and Moscow.[130][131][132] Language[edit] Vienna is part of the Austro-Bavarian language area, in particular Central Bavarian (Mittelbairisch).[133] In recent years, linguistics experts have seen a decline in the use of the Viennese variant.[134][135] Manfred Glauninger, sociolinguist at the Institute for Austrian Dialect and Name Lexica, has observed three issues. First, many parents feel there's a stigma attached to the Viennese dialect so they speak Standard German to their children. Second, many children have recently immigrated to Austria and are learning German as a second language in school. Third, young people are influenced by mass media which is most always delivered in Standard German.[136] Education[edit] Vienna is Austria's main center of education and home to many universities, professional colleges and gymnasiums (high schools). Statue of Friedrich Schiller in front of the Academy of Fine Arts The Vienna University of Economics and Business The University of Vienna's main building TU Wien Universities[edit] Academy of Fine Arts Vienna Central European University Diplomatic Academy of Vienna Medical University of Vienna PEF Private University of Management Vienna University of Applied Arts Vienna University of Applied Sciences Campus Vienna University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna University of Vienna Vienna University of Economics and Business University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna University of Applied Sciences Technikum Wien TU Wien Webster University Vienna Sigmund Freud University Vienna International Anti-Corruption Academy (in Laxenburg, 24 km (15 mi) south of Vienna) International schools[edit] Danube International School International University Vienna SAE Vienna Lauder Business School Lycée Français de Vienne Vienna Christian School Vienna International School American International School Japanische Schule in Wien (Japanese school) Amadeus International School Leisure activities[edit] Parks and gardens[edit] The Schönbrunn gardens in autumn Vienna possesses many parks, including the Stadtpark, the Burggarten, the Volksgarten (part of the Hofburg), the Schlosspark at Schloss Belvedere (home to the Vienna Botanic Gardens), the Donaupark, the Schönbrunner Schlosspark, the Prater, the Augarten, the Rathauspark, the Lainzer Tiergarten, the Dehnepark, the Resselpark, the Votivpark, the Kurpark Oberlaa, the Auer-Welsbach-Park and the Türkenschanzpark. Green areas include Laaer-Berg (including the Bohemian Prater) and the foothills of the Wienerwald, which reaches into the outer areas of the city. Small parks, known by the Viennese as Beserlparks, are everywhere in the inner city areas. Many of Vienna's parks include monuments, such as the Stadtpark with its statue of Johann Strauss II, and the gardens of the baroque palace, where the State Treaty was signed. Vienna's principal park is the Prater which is home to the Riesenrad, a Ferris wheel, and Kugelmugel, a micronation the shape of a sphere. The imperial Schönbrunn's grounds contain an 18th-century park which includes the world's oldest zoo, founded in 1752. The Donauinsel, part of Vienna's flood defenses, is a 21.1 km (13.1 mi) long artificial island between the Danube and Neue Donau dedicated to leisure activities. Sport[edit] Ernst-Happel-Stadion in the Prater Austria's capital is home to numerous football teams. The best known are the local football clubs include FK Austria Wien (21 Austrian Bundesliga titles and record 27-time cup winners), SK Rapid Wien (record 32 Austrian Bundesliga titles), and the oldest team, First Vienna FC. Other important sports clubs include the Raiffeisen Vikings Vienna (American Football), who won the Eurobowl title between 2004 and 2007 4 times in a row and had a perfect season in 2013, the Aon hotVolleys Vienna, one of Europe's premier Volleyball organizations, the Vienna Wanderers (baseball) who won the 2012 and 2013 Championship of the Austrian Baseball League, and the Vienna Capitals (Ice Hockey). Vienna was also where the European Handball Federation (EHF) was founded. There are also three rugby clubs; Vienna Celtic, the oldest rugby club in Austria, RC Donau, and Stade Viennois Vienna hosts many different sporting events including the Vienna City Marathon, which attracts more than 10,000 participants every year and normally takes place in May. In 2005 the Ice Hockey World Championships took place in Austria and the final was played in Vienna. Vienna's Ernst Happel Stadium was the venue of four Champions League and European Champion Clubs' Cup finals (1964, 1987, 1990 and 1995) and on 29 June it hosted the final of Euro 2008 which saw a Spanish 1–0 victory over Germany. Tennis tournament Vienna Open also takes place in the city since 1974. The matches are played in the Wiener Stadthalle. The Neue Donau, which was formed after the Donauinsel was created, is free of river traffic and a popular destination for leisure and sports activities. Vienna will host the official 2021 3x3 Basketball World Cup.[137] Culinary specialities[edit] Food[edit] See also: Austrian cuisine Sachertorte Vienna is well known for Wiener Schnitzel, a cutlet of veal (Kalbsschnitzel) or pork (Schweinsschnitzel) that is pounded flat, coated in flour, egg and breadcrumbs, and fried in clarified butter. It is available in almost every restaurant that serves Viennese cuisine and can be eaten hot or cold. The traditional 'Wiener Schnitzel' though is a cutlet of veal. Other examples of Viennese cuisine include Tafelspitz (very lean boiled beef), which is traditionally served with Geröstete Erdäpfel (boiled potatoes mashed with a fork and subsequently fried) and horseradish sauce, Apfelkren (a mixture of horseradish, cream and apple) and Schnittlauchsauce (a chives sauce made with mayonnaise and stale bread). Wiener Schnitzel Vienna has a long tradition of producing cakes and desserts. These include Apfelstrudel (hot apple strudel), Milchrahmstrudel (milk-cream strudel), Palatschinken (sweet pancakes), and Knödel (dumplings) often filled with fruit such as apricots (Marillenknödel). Sachertorte, a delicately moist chocolate cake with apricot jam created by the Sacher Hotel, is world-famous. In winter, small street stands sell traditional Maroni (hot chestnuts) and potato fritters. Sausages are popular and available from street vendors (Würstelstand) throughout the day and into the night. The sausage known as Wiener (German for Viennese) in the U.S. and in Germany, is called a Frankfurter in Vienna. Other popular sausages are Burenwurst (a coarse beef and pork sausage, generally boiled), Käsekrainer (spicy pork with small chunks of cheese), and Bratwurst (a white pork sausage). Most can be ordered ""mit Brot"" (with bread) or as a ""hot dog"" (stuffed inside a long roll). Mustard is the traditional condiment and usually offered in two varieties: ""süß"" (sweet) or ""scharf"" (spicy). Kebab, pizza and noodles are, increasingly, the snack foods most widely available from small stands. The Naschmarkt is a permanent market for fruit, vegetables, spices, fish, meat, etc., from around the world. The city has many coffee and breakfast stores. Drinks[edit] A typical Heurigen-Restaurant in Grinzing Vienna, along with Paris, Santiago, Cape Town, Prague, Canberra, Bratislava and Warsaw, is one of the few remaining world capital cities with its own vineyards.[138] The wine is served in small Viennese pubs known as Heuriger, which are especially numerous in the wine growing areas of Döbling (Grinzing, Neustift am Walde, Nußdorf, Salmannsdorf, Sievering), Floridsdorf (Stammersdorf, Strebersdorf), Liesing (Mauer) and Favoriten (Oberlaa). The wine is often drunk as a Spritzer (""G'spritzter"") with sparkling water. The Grüner Veltliner, a dry white wine, is the most widely cultivated wine in Austria.[139] Another wine very typical for the region is ""Gemischter Satz"", which is typically a blend of different types of wines harvested from the same vineyard.[140] Beer is next in importance to wine. Vienna has a single large brewery, Ottakringer, and more than ten microbreweries. A ""Beisl"" is a typical small Austrian pub, of which Vienna has many. Also, local soft drinks such as Almdudler are popular around the country as an alternative to alcoholic beverages, placing it on the top spots along American counterparts such as Coca-Cola in terms of market share. Another popular drink is the so-called ""Spezi"", a mix between Coca-Cola and the original formula of Orange Fanta or the more locally renowned Frucade. Viennese cafés[edit] Demel Café Viennese cafés have an extremely long and distinguished history that dates back centuries, and the caffeine addictions of some famous historical patrons of the oldest are something of a local legend.[citation needed] These coffee houses are unique to Vienna and many cities have unsuccessfully sought to copy them. Some people consider cafés as their extended living room where nobody will be bothered if they spend hours reading a newspaper while enjoying their coffee. Traditionally, the coffee comes with a glass of water. Viennese cafés claim to have invented the process of filtering coffee from booty captured after the second Turkish siege in 1683. Viennese cafés claim that when the invading Turks left Vienna, they abandoned hundreds of sacks of coffee beans. The Polish King John III Sobieski, the commander of the anti-Turkish coalition of Poles, Germans, and Austrians, gave Franz George Kolschitzky (Polish – Franciszek Jerzy Kulczycki) some of this coffee as a reward for providing information that allowed him to defeat the Turks. Kolschitzky then opened Vienna's first coffee shop. Julius Meinl set up a modern roasting plant in the same premises where the coffee sacks were found, in 1891. Tourist attractions[edit] Further information: Tourist attractions in Vienna Major tourist attractions include the imperial palaces of the Hofburg and Schönbrunn (also home to the world's oldest zoo, Tiergarten Schönbrunn) and the Riesenrad in the Prater.

Vienna is the seat of a number of United Nations offices and various international institutions and companies, including the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), the OPEC Fund for International Development (OFID), the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO), the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA) and the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA). Vienna is the world's third ""UN city"", next to New York, Geneva, and Nairobi. Additionally, Vienna is the seat of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law's secretariat (UNCITRAL). In conjunction, the University of Vienna annually hosts the prestigious Willem C. Vis Moot, an international commercial arbitration competition for students of law from around the world. Diplomatic meetings have been held in Vienna in the latter half of the 20th century, resulting in documents bearing the name Vienna Convention or Vienna Document. Among the more important documents negotiated in Vienna are the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, as well as the 1990 Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe. Vienna also hosted the negotiations leading to the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on Iran's nuclear program as well as the Vienna peace talks for Syria. Vienna also headquartered the International Taekwon-Do Federation (ITF). Charitable organizations in Vienna[edit] Alongside international and intergovernmental organizations, there are dozens of charitable organizations based in Vienna. One such organization is the network of SOS Children's Villages, founded by Hermann Gmeiner in 1949. Today, SOS Children's Villages are active in 132 countries and territories worldwide. Others include HASCO. Another popular international event is the annual Life Ball, which supports people with HIV or AIDS. Guests such as Bill Clinton and Whoopi Goldberg were recent attendees. International city cooperations[edit] The general policy of the City of Vienna is not to sign any twin or sister city agreements with other cities. Instead Vienna has only cooperation agreements in which specific cooperation areas are defined.[144] Athens, Greece Belgrade, Serbia Bratislava, Slovakia Brno, Czech Republic Budapest, Hungary Chengdu, China Hamburg, Germany Kraków, Poland Ljubljana, Slovenia Paris, France Tehran, Iran Sanandaj, Iran Trieste, Italy Vancouver, Canada Zurich, Switzerland District to district partnerships[edit] In addition, individual Viennese districts have international partnerships all over the world. A detailed list is published on the website of the City of Vienna.[145] See also[edit] Donauinselfest List of honorary citizens of Vienna List of restaurants in Vienna List of Viennese List of World Heritage Sites in Austria OPENCities Outline of Vienna Soviet War Memorial (Vienna) Vienna Biennale Vienna Porcelain Manufactory Viennese German References[edit] ^ ""Dauersiedlungsraum der Gemeinden, Politischen Bezirke und Bundesländer, Gebietsstand 1.1.2019"".

We help global leaders understand and appreciate the linkages between these spheres by bridging partnerships and creating dialogue. Through our diplomatic efforts, we help decision-makers understand the far-reaching and cross-cutting benefits of sustainable energy and the risks of being left behind. Much of our sustainable energy diplomacy stems from our strong working relationships and partnerships with government, business leaders and the UN. We recognize that good policy and appropriate finance accelerate critical action on Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7). We support ambition on sustainable energy within the UN system and at other global goal setting and implementation fora. Our CEO serves as the UN Secretary-General’s Special Representative for Sustainable Energy for All (SRSG), which creates opportunities for SEforALL to contribute to the UN agenda on energy. Members of SEforALL’s senior management team identify strategic speaking engagements and bilateral meetings to deliver key messages on the critical path to success in achieving SDG7.

Its Advisory Board comprises distinguished leaders and experts from around the world who have pledged to act on this vision of a sustainable energy future. The initiative is supported in its work by a global facilitation team led by Kandeh Yumkella, the UN Secretary General’s Special Representative for Sustainable Energy. The World Bank Group (WBG) has launched a series of initiatives to enhance its financing and policy advice to help countries move towards the SE4ALL goals. In Sub-Saharan Africa and developing Asia, the focus is on access, where most of those without electricity live. For middle income countries the focus is on doubling the share of renewables, and on doubling the improvement of energy efficiency. Since 2012, ESMAP has helped deliver on a number of the commitments that the WBG has made towards the SE4All goals. That support has expanded to encompass a wide range of activities undertaken by ESMAP, other WBG energy teams, and World Bank partners. One of the largest ongoing programs is the SE4All Technical Assistance Program, which works to help countries achieve the goal of universal energy access by 2030. Complementing this program, ESMAP and the World Bank’s Energy Global Practice have established an SE4All Global Knowledge Hub. One of a number of regional and thematic hubs established by SE4ALL, the Global Knowledge Hub is designed to facilitate the creation, enhancement, and exchange of knowledge for the overall initiative.

Africa is at the forefront of the implementation of SE4All. Hosted by the African Development Bank (AfDB), the SE4All Africa Hub was officially launched in May 2013, during the AfDB’s Annual Meetings in Marrakesh, in partnership with African Union Commission (AUC), NEPAD Planning and Coordination Agency (NPCA) and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, President of the African Development Bank Group and Member of the SE4All Advisory Board, highlighted that “The SE4All Africa Hub plays an important role in forging the transformative partnerships needed to make access to energy for all a reality”. SE4All Africa Hub: Organisation and mission The Africa Hub is part of the SE4All global implementation structure, working closely with the Global Facilitation Team. It is composed of an Oversight and Operations Committee(OOC) and a Secretariat. The OOC provides strategic guidance for the operations of the Secretariat and comprises representatives from AUC, NPCA, AfDB, UNDP, and Southern African Development Community (SADC), which represents Regional Economic Communities. The Secretariat is responsible for carrying out the activities of the Africa Hub and its work program. The SE4ALL Africa Hub’s mission is to coordinate and facilitate implementation of the SE4All initiative following   a resolution of the Conference of Energy Ministers of Africa (CEMA). The Hub promotes African ownership, inclusiveness and a comprehensive approach to implementation in the 44 African countries that have joined SE4All. It provides guidance to African governments and energy stakeholders, delivers technical assistance, fosters networking and communication, and contributes towards finance mobilisation. In close collaboration with partners, the Africa Hub has further worked to define the SE4All country action processes. Specifically, the Hub led the development of the Action Agenda template and promoted its adoption as an umbrella framework for long-term country-level energy sector development. It also served as a coordination platform for sector-wide coherence and synergy in attaining SE4All goals. As a result, SE4All Action Agendas and Investment Prospectuses are under development in 28 and 18 African countries respectively. They are developed through a multi-stakeholder process bringing together government actors, development partners, private sector and civil society. In addition, the Africa Hub has been providing direct technical assistance in response to government requests to more than 10 African countries to advance SE4All country actions. In 2015, the Africa Hub started implementing the Green Mini-Grid Market Development Program in cooperation with the Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa (SEFA) to scale-up the adoption of mini-grids as an integral solution to enhancing energy access in rural areas. With the adoption of a dedicated Sustainable Development Goal on Energy (SDG 7) in September 2015 in New York, the focus must shift toward implementation of activities described in Action Agendas and mobilisation of required investments to implement project opportunities identified in Investment Prospectuses. The Africa Hub will therefore play a vital role in realising this progression in close collaboration with SE4All partners. The Africa Hub’s Support Network Two instruments support the SE4All Africa Hub in its operations: Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa (SEFA) SEFA was established in 2011 at the African Development Bank with Denmark’s commitment of $56 million to allow the AfDB to scale-up its engagement in the small to medium-sized renewable energy and energy efficiency space. Subsequently, SEFA was transformed into a multi-donor facility with an initial $5 million commitment from the United States, as part of a multi-year engagement under President Obama’s Power Africa Initiative, and a contribution of GBP 10 million from the UK’s Department for International Cooperation. SEFA is one of Africa’s instruments under the SE4All Initiative and cooperates closely with the Africa Hub. SEFA operates through three financing components all focused on unlocking private investments in small to medium sustainable energy projects: (i) grants to facilitate the preparation of bankable projects; (ii) equity investments to bridge the financing gap and infuse managerial capacity, and (iii) support to public sector in improving the enabling environment. Since its inception, SEFA has played a key role in structuring the first truly Pan-African $200 million private equity fund focused on renewable energy, the African Renewable Energy Fund (AREF), of which SEFA and the AfDB are the anchor sponsors, having invested more than $50 million. African Climate Technology Centre (ACTC) The ACTC is financed by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) with some US$ 14.3 million, and implemented by the AfDB over a three-year period. The objective of the Centre is to support sub-Saharan African countries in scaling-up the deployment of low carbon and climate resilient technologies for climate change mitigation and adaptation by: (1) Enhancing networking and knowledge dissemination with respect to climate technology transfer and financing; (2) Enabling the scaling-up of technology transfer through policy, institutional and organisational reforms of the country and regional enabling environments; and (3) Integrating climate change technologies into investment programmes and projects. The mitigation activities focus exclusively on the energy sector, and are aligned with the SE4All initiative. Since its inception in 2014, the Centre has been financing technical assistance activities related to SE4All implementation in 10 sub-Saharan African countries.

On Earth Day in April 2007, Mayor Bloomberg announced plaNYC2030 and presented it as a bold and comprehensive strategy to address the challenges of population growth, aging infrastructure, and the environment. The plan set forth ten broad goals and 127 different initiatives to address issues affecting land, water, transportation, energy, air, and climate change.  Four years later in April 2011, an updated version of the plan was announced, providing information regarding the project's progress as well as the introduction of many new initiatives including the regulation of heating fuels, planting one million trees, and the reduction of green house gases. Whether we praise or criticize the details of the plan, it is important to keep alive the many discussions about long-term sustainability in New York City. Sustainability Watch aims to look at how the plan is working, gaps between the stated goals and the practice of city agencies, and ways to improve the plan.This is an opportunity for open public discussion about a range of city policies, and a first concerted attempt to tackle thorny environmental problems.

As an organic farmer, observer of the food system, and former scientist, I am of the opinion that growing your own food on a local level with as few inputs as possible is the only truly sustainable way for humans to continue producing and consuming food on this planet. SHI empowers willing participants to do just that. Through this process, more carbon is stored in the soil, the effects of climate change are mitigated, the lives of participant families are improved, and essential knowledge is gathered. The work of these farmers and the work of SHI not only benefit those taking up the effort to grow their own food but benefit present and future life on Earth.

Their work is amazing, and I was hooked when I heard the stories of volunteer work where the board of directors went down to work with farming families who were in various phases of the 5 year training program. On one farm, they installed a watering system on a super steep hillside, that was so hard to water before, and now it is super easy! SHI's work usually starts with building a latrine, to keep their water from being contaminated and making their whole family sick. They also work with each farming family and talk about what kind of crops they would like to grow - to creating a varied batch of foods to grow with multi story cropping, not just all corn. So if they plant a mahogany tree that must grow for many years before it becomes valuable as timber, how do they keep farmers from chopping them down too soon - grow vanilla bean vines up on the mahogany trees! To restore soli, they have ways to introduce nitrogen (bio char and a fast growing nitrogen fixing plant (the name I forgot, but it can grow in the worst soil) , and to keep the soil healthy they can build a moveable chicken coop - the chicken poop is fertilizer. And how to grow and plant seedlings. SHI installs wood conserving stoves in families homes which improves conditions and reduces asthma! Children's diets improve so they are not suffering from malnutrition. I mean how ironic is it that farmers children have been suffering from malnutrition? There are so many clever things that they teach farming families, I am always amazed. My daughter is serving on the board now, and I could not be prouder of her!

It is one of the few environmental organizations that realized early that environmental sustainability is tied to the health of soils which, in turn can give people hope for a better life. Improve soil health without harmful chemical inputs, and people will thrive no matter where they are. If they understand their health and welfare are tied to the soil and have sufficient basic knowledge and practices to be good stewards of the soil, anything is possible. Climate change could even be reversed if large farms adopted regenerative practices. The earth is abundant and can support all life if we learn the lessons of soil stewardship.

This non-profit was started by a former volunteer in my program who served in Panama. She has won numerous awards and they have kept true to their mission promoting organic agriculture, agroforestry and sustainable practices for the poorest farmers. I know in supporting this organization, I am helping people AND the environment which is not easy to do these days. They have a terrific staff and have made great strides in the past three years. Great organization worthy of support. But what have they done, you ask? Here are a few of the stats: Helped families plant over 3.7 million trees provided long term support (average 5 years) to 1,127 families to convert from slash and burn agriculture Increased average agricultural family income by 23% Built many wood conserving stoves, water systems and latrines.

She went on to do some amazing things. She has assembled a terrific board and staff that is dedicated to working up to five years with individual families, bringing them knowledge of how to transition from the terribly destructive 'slash and burn' farming to sustainable practices. This is essential for the conservation of forests, wildlife and water. It is also critical to the wellbeing of rural communities. SHI maintains low overhead, making sure that gifts and grants result in program field results in Belize, Panama, Honduras and Nicaragua. Thanks SHI for making the world a better place for all of us.

The founder is creative, smart, driven, caring and dedicated - and she has built an amazing team of super talented people. Very well run and efficient. Their work helps heal the earth, rejuvenating the soil - in rural communities, they work with farming families giving long term training in organic methods of farming. This helps families eat better with a more varied diet, and allows them to have surplus produce to sell. The farming methods sequester carbon, so it helps clean the air we all breath.Sustainable Harvest International is Good for the Environment, Good for People.

General Member of the Public 10/15/2019 Rating: 5 10/15/2019 I got to know the work of Sustainable Harvest International, (SHI), while serving in the Peace Corps in Panama. Although my scope of work was to support my small community’s efforts for a safe and well-maintained water supply, I became aware of SHI and of their work in a neighboring community. I invited SHI to adopt my community and they gracefully accepted the invitation.During my two years in Panama I had the opportunity to observe firsthand the amazing work that this organization is doing in the field. SHI employs local experts who visit the adopted communities weekly and help the families that participate in its program by giving them not only training and advise, but also seeds, saplings, and tools as the need may be. The experts know the local culture, how to identify the people who need assistance the most, and how to maximize the outcome of their limited resources.When I left Panama in August 2019 SHI had been working in my community for 7 months. I participated in the training of making organic fertilizer, in the formation of a demonstrative farming plot, and in the construction of an “eco-stove” that burns ¼ of the wood that traditional stoves use. I also saw pastureland that had never been cultivated before transformed into a vegetable farm based on the guidance of SHI.I consider SHI’s adopting my community as the major accomplishment of my Peace Corps service.

I was lucky to be part of a Church women's trip in 2009 and spent 10 days working along side the small farmers and their families. They were elated that we had traveled so far to spend time with them and visit their humble homes. SHI has provided tools and knowledge for a better way to plant without using the slash/burning practice that is so common in Central America They also provide materials to build a very efficient burning stove with a chimney creating a healthier environment for the women and children who spend most of their time inside the house. All the practices are sustainable and organic, no pesticides but the most important part is that is a partnership with the farmers to increase access to healthy food and income. I got so impressed that I became involved first as a volunteer and now as a Board member. SHI has my fully support!

Share this review: Flag review Previous Stories 2 Charlotte Dougherty Board Member 09/12/2013 Rating: 5 09/12/2013 I have spent most of my professional life working on social change from the top down, assisting government agencies in creating programs and policies that promote environmental protection, conservation, and sustainable development. I have often been frustrated by political roadblocks, problems with implementation, or limited results on the ground. I am coming to realize that real social change happens from the bottom up in individuals, families and communities. This is how lives are transformed and positive impacts are sustained. This is what Sustainable Harvest International (SHI) is doing in Central America. While in Piedras Negras, Honduras as an SHI volunteer, I witnessed the commitment that families make to alleviate their hunger – from the backbreaking tilling of small hillside plots of parched land, to hauling water, bottle-by-bottle from a distant stream to water tender seedlings. I experienced how community members supported and trained one another – sharing limited resources and tools, working together to build chicken coops and wood-conserving stoves for other families, and looking after each other’s children. I saw adults in the community care for the land - nourishing it for future generations and devoting themselves to teaching children sustainable farming methods. I have returned to Piedras Negras with SHI several times since my first visit, and I am astounded at the palpable changes resulting from SHI’s work. I no longer see malnourished children. Miquel and Candia, (my hosts) are now happy and healthy – laughing and playing with their children and proud of their accomplishments. The plantains that I helped Evan and his family plant two years ago are not only a staple of the families improved diet, but are also a commercial crop providing needed income for the children’s school fees. Sustainable Harvest International does an amazing job of motivating social change from the bottom up. The organization works in rural farming communities in Belise, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama, providing seeds, training and support to families desparate to grow food and sustain themselves and their land. SHI is truly changing lives and the productivity of land that those lives depend on.

Selling surplus produce helps with school fees for their children and needed medical attention.

I have had the opportunity as a volunteer to work with SHI programs in Belize and Panama, and the experience was life changing. It quickly became apparent to me that The SHI model truly works. I was so impressed with this organization that I became a committee member for several years, and am now serving my second year as a board member.

I have found SHI to be a truly unique organization in a variety of very positive ways. SHI's small staff accomplishes amazing things. It is addressing some of the most important global issues such as climate change on a local level. By teaching farmers how to grow healthy vegetables through organic farming, SHI is is able to provide healthy food for families and to market their excess crops thereby generating some income for their families. SHI's 5 phase program usually takes about 5 to 6 years to complete. It is a comprehensive plan that produces outstanding results. An additional benefit of SHI's program is that, by teaching farmers how to grow their crops using organic methods, they no longer engage in the traditional slash and burn techniques which have been destroying the tropical rain forests which is a leading cause of climate change. I am very proud to be associated with such a worthwhile organizations which has a record achieving outstanding results.

I have been involved as a board member and staff member of a number of NGOs working overseas. SHI stands out as an organization that works hand in hand with local farmers and helps build the local infrastructure so that local farmers are helping train and educate other local farmers. It has a well thought out 5 phase program that results in outstanding crop production that does not deplete the soil. It creates a real win - win situation as the local farmers no longer need to use the slash and burn technique of their forefathers, which was devastating the forests. With sustainable agriculture, not only do the farmers have a broad variety of crops with better yields, but the forests and the many species who call the forests home, are no longer being burned. So SHI not only helps the farmers, it also has a significant impact upon the environment by saving tens of thousands of trees each year. I had the opportunity to visit SHI programs in Panama this year and was impressed by the results being achieved. In one small village I saw many farmers graduating from the 5 phase program. One local farmer had significantly diversified his crops, created a fish pond, created a rice paddy, installed an irrigation system. He also installed a composting toilet and a very energy efficient stove. All this was accomplished with the advice and support of the local SHI field trainer. SHI has a very small staff in the US so that most of the money donated to SHI can be used to support the local organizations with which it works in four Central American countries - Belize, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama. These local organizations, with the support of SHI, hire and train the local staff who then work with the local farmers. As a donor to non-profits, I want to see my donations having a real impact. With SHI, I am assured of my donation having an impact in supporting sustainable agriculture in Central America and saving the forests. It also has positive impact upon the environment.

Not only do participant families learn to plant healthy foods in a sustainable manner--while preserving tropical forests--but they also feel empowered in many aspects of their lives. Women have noted that learning to cultivate food and often earn income has helped them take on new leadership roles in their community. Individuals who formerly had little access to education now have the confidence and resources to send their children off to school. And communities feel empowered to come together around any issue, challenge, or opportunity as a result of their work with Sustainable Harvest International. SHI changes peoples' lives and those changes even ripple out to impact others in the community for the better.

SHI works to lift families out of poverty in four Central American countries by providing field trainers who promote sustainable farming methods instead of traditional slash and burn. Results to date have shown improved nutrition and added income which pays for school fees and other needs. Benefits to the planet include improving the farm soil, preventing erosion, planting trees and improving biodiversity. During my visit to Belize I saw the results first hand and got to meet the dedicated and enthusiastic field trainers. It is important to me that SHI uses residents of the country as field trainers rather than US experts. Share this review: Flag review 1 Carole W.

I traveled to Belize with them on a trip where we met the families that were working with SHI and who had experienced improvement in their annual income and changed the way they farm. I volunteered by helping to plant trees, built a solar latrine and a stove for a Maya family that previously had no stove. This stove used only 1/3 of the wood previously used and eliminated the smoke from their home which contributed to poor health.

One farmer, Demitrio Martinez, decided to farm because of bad experiences working in commercial rice fields. The first year he rented the land and started immediately with SHI-Panama. Eventually his father bought the land for him. Because of his experience with the chemicals in the commercial rice fields, he was quite willing to work with sustainable, organic methods. This was hard work since it meant working steep slopes with very abused soil and lots of insects and hauling buckets of water up from a small stream during the dry season. His number one income-producing crops are greens -- which he calls mustard greens and many other kinds of vegetables as well. He and his farm have been such a success that it is now a demonstration farm, with many other improvements including a fish pond and rice paddy. SHI's board was there to tour the farm and to attend a graduation ceremony for Demetrio and 35 other families. It was wonderful to see so many women and men with their families graduating and we had a special ceremony, lunch and musical entertainment to top it off. It was a remarkable day and a remarkable testament to the mission of SHI - providing farming families in Central America with the training and tools to preserve our planet's tropical forests while overcoming poverty. SHI is making our world a better place for all of us.

Much of my work over the past 25 years has been in the international field, primarily in Africa, Asia, and Europe. I became aware of SHI through a contact with Flo Reed, SHI's founder. The more I researched the work that they are doing in four Central American countries, the more convinced I became that this was an organization worth supporting with my donations. As I became more knowledgeable about what SHI was able to accomplish, my commitment to SHI became even stronger and I agreed to serve on its board. SHI has a great leadership group in the US that works together in support of the programs in Central America. I have visited SHI programs in Panama and Belize and will be visiting SHI programs in Honduras in February 2015. I have seen firsthand how the SHI programs are transforming farming in these communities. It has virtually eliminated the slash and burn method of farming. It has created a far more diverse and healthier diet for the families. The crops are rotated and are grown using organic methods. It is a real win for preserving the rain forests, a win for the families in eating a far healthier diet, and finally a win producing food that can be sold at local markets, which also helps the financial position of the families.

Each time I have come away deeply impressed with the dedication and sensitivity of the field trainers and the pride and motivation of the farming families. I see the sense of empowerment as they chose to learn new more environmentally-friendly and healthy alternatives to slash-and-burn agriculture and to plant a variety of vegetables that they previously had to buy -- when they had the money to do so. The progress in the communities which I visit each year with a group from Washington DC has been astounding. There are productive gardens near the homes; there are fields with basic crops (corn and beans), a huge variety of vegetables and herbs, and ""forest gardens"" where mahogany and coffee plants shade smaller crops like ginger. I wish I could take everyone interested in SHI to meet Don Noe of La Majada. Noe farms less than two acres, but he is so proud of the crops he is harvesting.

Grown from Flo's deeply held values SHI allows poor farmers to take responsibility for reversing environmental degradation and achieving economic viability within their own countries. The most amazing thing is that after 16 years this organization is thriving with 60 percent of its support coming from individuals who believe in the mission and want to ensure its capacity to work with farmers and communities. More amazing is that this tiny organization returns 83 percent of its $1.6 million budget to programs that serve 4 affiliate offices in 4 countries and thousands of men, women, and children.

I discovered SHI on-line while researching for my MBA of Sustainable Business at Marylhurst University in Portland Oregon. The reports that I have received to translate from communities in Panama, Nicaragua, and Honduras have given me a valuable look at the wonderful work SHI is doing in remote locations that have very few options, if any, to earn money to send their children to school, start home-based businesses, and restore the environment using sustainable agricultural practices. The success stories and testimonials that I have translated not only inform me about how critical the SHI mission is to those most in need, but in a model that does not patronize or lock them into destructive globalization strategies. SHI truly helps these communities, sometimes one family at a time, but more often raising the hopes and living standards of entire communities in sustainable ways.

WHAT'S THE STORY?It all started in the early 1990’s. Florence Reed was serving as an environmental education and forestry extension Peace Corps volunteer in Panama. During her service, she witnessed the tragic human component of tropical deforestation: huge swaths of lush tropical forests being burnt to a crisp as desperate farmers sought new land to farm. To make matters worse, the new land only provided enough nutrients for several years before more forest had to be burned down. Reed knew that the farmers recognized the catastrophic impacts of slash-and-burn agriculture, but they could't see any other way to provide for their families. Through living, eating, and working alongside these farmers, Reed realized that practical training in more sustainable agricultural methods could provide them with a way to continue to provide for their families and protect and restore their precious ecosystems. Driven to find an alternative to slash-and-burn, Reed did extensive research on sustainable alternatives during her Peace Corps tenure, training farmers on new techniques and tools. Together, they met with considerable success. As a Peace Corps Volunteer, however, the time Reed had to train farmers on sustainable agriculture and agroforestry was limited. It was through this experience that Reed saw the need to create a multi-year program that would give farmers ample time to learn, experiment, adjust, and potentially adopt these new practices.Reed connected with so many farmers in Coclé, Panama that her Peace Corps Program Director joked that they should rename the province ""Floclé"" for all the work she had done to create lasting environmental and economic change there. Moved by the power of these sustainable techniques and how they met the expressed needs of the farmers and the environment, Reed sought to build upon this tremendous potential to create significant and lasting change throughout Central America. Investing in infrastructure, funds, staffing, and ensuring buy-in from local communities were a crucial part of the start-up process. Much of the brainstorming during this phase happened in a spare bedroom Reed's parents donated for use as her first office space. Reed started in Honduras, visiting potential communities and organizations doing similar work. She wanted to ensure that rural farmers were 100% invested. From experience, she knew that grassroots change is the longest lasting. After cultivating a relationship with concerned university professors, small business owners, teachers, and non-profit executives, Sustainable Harvest International was founded in 1997, complete with a Board of Directors, three employees, and 50 participant families in one Central American country (Honduras). A pilot program started in Honduras and then extended to Belize, Nicaragua, and Panama. Sustainable Harvest International now has programs in three Central American countries, a strong dynamic board of directors, seven US-based staff, 24 field staff, and a lively community of dedicated donors that allow our locally-hired field trainers to keep doing their important work. We've now worked with over 2,891 families and planted 4 million trees and look forward to what we can accomplish in the future with your help.Read more about Florence Reed and how Sustainable Harvest International started in this profile in the Portland Press Herald. Don Cheyo graduated from Sustainable Harvest International's 5-phase program, fully replacing slash-and-burn with organic farming techniques, and his income rose over 900%!

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.Find sources: ""Sustainable Population Australia"" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR (February 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Sustainable Population Australia (SPA) (formerly Australians for an Ecologically Sustainable Population) is an Australian special advocacy group, founded in Canberra in 1988, that seeks to establish an ecologically sustainable human population. SPA claims that it is an ""ecological group dedicated to preserving species' habitats globally and in Australia from the degradation caused by human population growth"", and that it ""works on many fronts to encourage informed public debate about how Australia and the world can achieve an ecologically sustainable population"". SPA argues that population growth exacerbates Australia's water shortage and adds to greenhouse gas emissions. SPA also seeks to highlight what it claims are the negative economic effects of population growth, such as increased housing costs, lower wages and living standards, and opposes the current historically high level of immigration to Australia. Immigration to Australia has averaged around 200,000 per annum over the past decade. It is the highest rate of immigration in the world.[citation needed] SPA also opposes plans by the government to increase population growth with the baby bonus, a payout that encourages parents to have more children.[1] SPA believes that the baby bonus, and the many other government ""breeding incentives"", should only be paid for the first child, halved for the second, and not paid at all for any more births than that.[citation needed] See also[edit] Optimum population Sustainable Australia Stop Population Growth Now Big Australia References[edit] ^ ""Baby Bonus Bad for Environment"" (PDF).

As energy efficiency is not ""visible"", it is often not given the policy and investment priority it needs to deliver the Sustainable Development Goals. As a result, the energy efficiency rate of improvement has declined, leaving it well below the level needed to achieve the SDG 7.3 target. However, energy efficiency has the potential to cost-effectively contribute 40 percent of the emissions savings goals of the Paris Agreement, can accelerate SDG 7.1 energy access progress and support increasing the “share” of renewable energy needed to achieve SDG 7.2. Activities SEforALL seeks partnerships to support strategic interventions that will drive action towards delivering and achieving energy efficiency commitments, to strengthen the enabling environment for investment in energy efficiency infrastructure and projects that will deliver energy efficiency and sustainable development progress. To operationalize this objective, we see three distinct stages to support our theory of change: Elevate energy efficiency: advocating for energy efficiency in global agendas, creating a clear narrative to advocate for energy efficiency, convening partners and matching solution offers Support energy efficiency: Three Percent Club partners to deliver strategic support and technical assistance in countries on key issues for high impact sectors Invest in energy efficiency: project implementation delivered through loans, grants and incentives for infrastructure and projects by member countries, funds and financial institution partners SEforALL and partners support progress to enable energy efficiency investment in: Buildings: energy efficient and sustainable buildings with the Building Efficiency Accelerator, Zero Carbon Building Accelerator, GlobalABC and partners Cities: energy efficient and sustainable cities with networks, such as C40, Global Covenant of Mayors, the World Economic Forum Net Zero Carbon Cities program and partners Energy supply: efficient and sustainable generation, distribution and transmission of energy with the District Energy Initiative and partners Industry: efficient, sustainable and productive industries with Industrial Energy Accelerator, Mission Possible Partnership and partners Products: energy efficient and sustainable appliances, technologies and materials with United for Efficiency, Efficiency for Access and partners Services: effective energy efficiency services with Global ESCO Network and partners Transport: energy efficient and sustainable mobility with Sustainable Mobility for All, Global Fuel Economy Initiative and partners Goals SEforALL will support partners and countries to increase or redirect spending to cost-effective energy efficiency investments.

What is Sustainable Energy?Sustainability: According to the United Nations (the UN’s Brundtland Commission popularized the term in 1987), sustainability is defined as “meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” True sustainability is when everyone, everywhere can meet their basic needs forever.What is Sustainable Energy?Using the above definition for sustainability, sustainable energy is energy that meets the needs of the present generations without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Sustainable energy is about finding clean, renewable sources of energy—sources that renew themselves, rather than sources that can be depleted.Sustainable energy is energy that we will never use up or deplete. It is inexhaustible.Several forms of energy can be considered sustainable. In addition to the most commonly considered sources—wind, solar, and water—there’s also bioenergy and geothermal energy. Bioenergy is the process of creating energy from biological masses such as straw, manure and other agricultural byproducts. Geothermal energy is energy from Earth’s internal energy sources, like geysers.  Energy sustainability can also be achieved through improved energy conservation and efficiency.Sure, the sources of energy most commonly used may meet our current needs, but at the rate we’re using our current sources, like coal and natural gas, we’ll burn through them (no pun intended), leaving none behind for our children. Future generations will then be forced to do what we could already be doing—finding new ways to generate energy.Sustainable energy is not only naturally replenished, but it causes no harm to the environment, as there are no greenhouse gasses or other pollutants emitted.America has never been about standing still and resting on our laurels. Just because something works does not automatically mean it cannot be improved. Why should energy be any different? Why should we stand around and wait until a change is the only option? We can make changes today that make lives better for our current generation, creating new jobs while providing clean energy, and also improving the lives of future generations.Sustainable energy sources are the best sources of energy for our homes and businesses, because they are not only renewable but are also frequently developed closer to the end-user than are traditional power plants.Many are already making the move to solar, wind, and other sources of sustainable energy. You can, too, and the price is much lower than you might think. The price for sustainable-energy sources has decreased dramatically in the last decade, making them more affordable than ever. In many areas, including much of Alabama, an investment will pay off in just a few short years.We at Energy Alabama believe that we should not put off until tomorrow what we can change today. Sustainable energy should be encouraged, and we are doing everything we can to educate our community and encourage businesses and residents to make changes towards sustainable energy. We highly encourage you to consider what you can do to make the change to sustainable energy as well. If you aren’t sure what you can do, feel free to contact us and we’ll be glad to help. That’s why we’re here. There will always be sunlight, wind, and rain; therefore, these make for the best sources of energy. Will you join us in moving Alabama, and the United States, towards sustainable energy? “There is one thing more powerful than all the armies of the world, and that is an idea whose time has come.” — Victor Hugo Advance Clean Energy on Facebook!

149,"Sustainable energy - Wikipedia Sustainable energy From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search ""Green power"" redirects here. For other uses, see Green power (disambiguation). Sustainable energy involves increasing production of renewable energy, making safe energy universally available, and energy conservation. Clockwise from top left: Concentrated solar power with molten salt heat storage in Spain, wind energy in South Africa, clean cooking in Ethiopia, public transport in Singapore The use of energy is considered sustainable if it meets the needs of the present without compromising the needs of future generations. Definitions of sustainable energy typically include environmental aspects such as greenhouse gas emissions, and social and economic aspects such as energy poverty. Renewable energy sources such as wind, hydroelectric power, solar, and geothermal energy are generally far more sustainable than fossil fuel sources. However, some renewable energy projects, such as the clearing of forests to produce biofuels, can cause severe environmental damage. The role of non-renewable energy sources has been controversial. Nuclear power is a low-carbon source and has a safety record comparable to wind and solar,[1] but its sustainability has been debated because of concerns about nuclear proliferation, radioactive waste and accidents. Switching from coal to natural gas has environmental benefits but may lead to a delay in switching to more sustainable options. Carbon capture and storage technology can be built into power plants to remove their carbon dioxide emissions, but is expensive and has seldom been implemented. The global energy system, which is 85% based on fossil fuels, is responsible for over 70% of the greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change. More than 750 million people lack access to electricity and over 2.6 billion rely on polluting fuels such as wood or charcoal to cook. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions to levels consistent with the Paris Agreement will require a system-wide transformation of the way energy is produced, distributed, stored, and consumed. As the burning of fossil fuels and biomass is a major contributor to air pollution, which causes an estimated 7 million deaths each year, the transition to a low-carbon energy system would have strong co-benefits for human health. Pathways exist to provide universal access to electricity and clean cooking technologies in ways that are compatible with climate goals, while bringing major health and economic benefits to developing countries. Climate change mitigation scenarios describe pathways in which the world would rapidly shift to low-emission methods of generating electricity, rely less on burning fuels for energy, and rely more on electricity instead. For some energy-intensive technologies and processes that are difficult to electrify, many scenarios describe a growing role for hydrogen fuel produced from low-emission energy sources. To accommodate larger shares of variable renewable energy, electrical grids require flexibility through infrastructure such as energy storage. To make deep cuts in emissions, infrastructure and technologies that use energy, such as buildings and transport systems, would need to be modified to use clean forms of energy and also to conserve energy. Some critical technologies for eliminating energy-related greenhouse gas emissions are not yet mature. Wind and solar energy sources generated 8.5% of worldwide electricity in 2019, a share that has grown rapidly while costs have fallen and are projected to continue falling. The IPCC estimates that 2.5% of world GDP would need to be invested in the energy system each year between 2016 and 2035 to limit global warming to 1.5 °C (2.7 °F). Well-designed government policies that promote energy system transformation can lower greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality simultaneously, and in many cases can also increase energy security. Policy approaches include carbon-pricing, renewable portfolio standards, phase-outs of fossil fuel subsidies, and the development of infrastructure to support electrification and sustainable transport.

Development is not possible without energy, and sustainable development is not possible without sustainable energy."" UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon[2] Definitions[edit] The United Nations Brundtland Commission in its 1987 report, Our Common Future, described the concept of sustainable development, for which energy is a key component. It defined sustainable development as development that ""meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs"".[3] This description of sustainable development has since been referenced in many definitions and explanations of sustainable energy.[3][4][5][6] No single interpretation of how the concept of sustainability applies to energy has gained worldwide acceptance.[7] Working definitions of sustainable energy encompass multiple dimensions of sustainability, such as environmental, economic, and social dimensions.[6] Within sustainable development, the theme of environmental sustainability was historically the most prominent, but this later widened to encompass the economic and social pillar of sustainable development.[8] The environmental dimension includes greenhouse gas emissions, impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems, the production of hazardous waste and toxic emissions,[7] water consumption,[9] and depletion of non-renewable resources.[6] Energy sources with low environmental impact are sometimes referred to as 'green energy' or 'clean energy'. The economic dimension covers economic development, efficient use of energy and energy security to ensure that each country has constant access to sufficient energy.[7][10][11] Social issues include the access to affordable and reliable energy for all people, workers rights and land rights.[6][7] Environmental issues[edit] The use of modern renewable energy sources increased from 2000 to 2019 but coal, oil, and natural gas remain the most-used global energy sources.[12] The current energy system contributes to many environmental problems, including climate change, air pollution, biodiversity loss, the release of toxins into the environment, and water scarcity. As of 2019, 85% of the world's energy needs are met by burning fossil fuels.[13] Energy production and consumption are responsible for 76% of annual human-caused greenhouse gas emissions as of 2018.[14][15] The burning of fossil fuels and biomass is a major source of air pollutants.[16][17] The combustion of coal releases gases which form into ground-level ozone and acid rain, especially if the coal is not cleaned before combustion.[18] Air pollution is the second-leading cause of death from non-infectious disease.[19] Around 91% of the world's population lives with levels of air pollution that exceed the World Health Organization's (WHO) recommended limits.[20] The WHO estimates that outdoor air pollution causes 4.2 million deaths per year.[21] Cooking with polluting fuels such as such as wood, animal dung, coal, or kerosene is responsible for nearly all indoor air pollution, which causes in an estimated 1.6 to 3.8 million deaths annually,[22][19] and also contributes significantly to outdoor air pollution.[23] Health effects are concentrated among women, who are likely to be responsible for cooking, and young children.[23] Environmental impacts extend beyond the by-products of combustion. Oil spills at sea harm marine life and may cause fires which release toxic emissions.[24] Around 10% of global water use goes to energy production, mainly for cooling in thermal energy plants. In dry regions, this contributes to water scarcity. Bioenergy production, coal mining and processing, and oil extraction also require large amounts of water.[25] Excessive harvesting of wood and other combustible material for burning can cause serious local environmental damage, including desertification.[26] Sustainable development goals[edit] Further information: Energy poverty and Energy poverty and cooking World map showing where people without access to electricity lived in 2016 – mainly in sub-Saharan Africa Meeting existing and future energy demand in a sustainable way is a critical challenge for the global ambition to reduce the impact of climate change while maintaining economic growth and enabling living standards to rise.[27] Reliable and affordable energy, particularly electricity, is essential for health care, education, and economic development.[28] As of 2019, 770 million people, three-quarters of whom live in sub-Saharan Africa, do not have access to electricity.[29] As of 2020, more than 2.6 billion people in developing countries rely on burning polluting fuels for cooking.[30] Improving energy access in the least-developed countries and making energy cleaner are key to achieving most of the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, which cover issues ranging from climate action to gender equality.[31] Sustainable Development Goal 7 calls for ""access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all"" by 2030.[32] Energy conservation[edit] Main articles: Energy conservation and Efficient energy use Global energy usage is highly unequal. High income countries such as the United States and Canada use 100 times as much energy per capita as some of the least developed countries in Africa.[33] The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that increasing energy efficiency can achieve 40% of greenhouse gas emission reductions needed to fulfil the Paris agreement.[34] Climate change mitigation pathways that are in line with these goals (keeping global warming limited to well below 2 °C (3.6 °F) or to 1.5 °C (2.7 °F)) show energy usage growing until 2050, but significantly slower than scenarios without climate policy.[35] Reducing overall energy demand would allow the growth in renewable energy sources to more rapidly displace fossil fuels.[36] Energy can be conserved by increasing the technical efficiency of appliances, vehicles, industrial processes and buildings.[37] Another approach is to use less materials that require a lot of energy for production, for example through better building design and recycling. Behavioural changes such as using videoconferencing rather than business flights, or making urban trips by cycling, walking or public transport rather than by car, are another way to conserve energy.[38] Government policies to improve efficiency can include building codes, performance standards, carbon pricing, and the development of energy-efficient infrastructure to encourage changes in transport modes.[38][39] The energy intensity of the global economy (the amount of energy needed per unit of GDP) is a rough indicator of the energy efficiency of economic production.[40] Energy intensity has been gradually decreasing for decades, however improvements have slowed in recent years,[40] and faster rate of efficiency improvement would be necessary to meet global targets for 2030.[40][41] Efficiency improvements often lead to a rebound effect in which consumers use the money they save to buy more energy-intensive goods and services.[42] Recent technical efficiency improvements in transport and buildings have been largely offset by trends in consumer behaviour, such as purchasing larger vehicles and homes.[41] Energy sources[edit] Renewable energy sources[edit] Main article: Renewable energy Growth of renewables was 45% larger in 2020 compared to 2019, including a 90% rise in global wind capacity additions (green) and a 23% expansion of new solar photovoltaic installations (yellow).[43] Renewable energy technologies are essential contributors to sustainable energy, as they generally contribute to global energy security and reduce dependence on fossil fuel resources, thus mitigating greenhouse gas emissions.[44] The term renewable energy refers to energy from resources that replenish naturally, while energy is considered sustainable if it is available for the foreseeable future. As such, renewable sources that are depleted by overuse may become unsustainable.[45] Renewable energy projects sometimes raise significant sustainability concerns, such as risks to biodiversity when areas of high ecological value are converted to bioenergy production, wind or solar farms.[46][47] Hydropower is the largest source of renewable electricity while solar and wind energy are growing rapidly. Photovoltaic solar and onshore wind are the cheapest forms of new power generation capacity in most countries.[48][49] For more than half of the 770 million people who currently lack access to electricity, decentralised renewable energy solutions such as solar-powered mini-grids are likely to be the cheapest method of providing access by 2030.[29] Solar[edit] A photovoltaic power station in California, United States Main articles: Solar power and Solar water heating The Sun is Earth's primary source of energy, a clean and abundantly available resource in many regions.[50] In 2019, solar power provided around 3% of global electricity,[51] mostly through solar panels based on photovoltaic cells (PV). The panels are mounted on top of building, or installed in utility-scale solar parks. Costs of solar photovoltaic cells have dropped rapidly, driving a strong growth in worldwide capacity.[52] The cost of electricity from new solar farms is competitive with, or in many places, cheaper than electricity from existing coal plants.[53] Various projections of future energy use identify solar PV as one of the main sources of energy generation in a sustainable mix.[54][55] Most components of solar panels can be easily recycled, but it is not always done in the absence of regulation.[56] Panels typically contain heavy metals, so they pose environmental risks if put in landfill.[57] Solar panels require energy for their production, equivalent to under two years of their own generation, but less if materials are recycled rather than mined.[58] In concentrated solar power, solar rays are concentrated by a field of mirrors, heating a fluid. Electricity is produced from the resulting steam with a heat engine. A part of the heat is typically stored, making this type of solar power dispatchable: it can be produced when needed.[59][60] In addition to electricity production, solar energy is also used more directly; solar thermal heating systems are applied for hot water production, heating buildings, drying and desalination.[61] Wind power[edit] Main articles: Wind power and Environmental impact of wind power Wind turbines in Xinjiang, China As a clean energy source, wind has been an important driver of development over millennia, providing transportation on water and mechanical energy for industrial processes and land reclamation.[62] In 2019, wind turbines provided approximately 6% of global electricity.[51] Electricity from onshore wind farms is often cheaper than existing coal plants, and competitive with natural gas and nuclear.[53] Wind turbines can be placed in the ocean where winds are steadier and stronger than on land but construction and maintenance costs are higher. According to some analyst forecasts, offshore wind power will become cheaper than onshore wind by the mid-2030s.[63] Onshore wind farms, often built in wild or rural areas, have a visual impact on the landscape.[64] While collisions with wind turbines kill both bats and to a lesser extent birds, these impacts are fewer than from other infrastructure such as windows and transmission lines.[65][66] The noise and flickering light created by the turbines can be annoying, and constrain construction near densely populated areas. Wind power, in contrast to nuclear and fossil fuel plants does not consume water to produce power.[67] Little energy is needed for wind turbine construction compared to the energy produced by the wind power plant itself.[68] Turbine blades are not fully recyclable and research into methods of manufacturing easier-to-recycle blades is ongoing.[69] Hydropower[edit] Main article: Hydroelectricity Guri Dam, a hydroelectric dam in Venezuela Hydroelectric plants convert the energy of moving water into electricity. On average, hydropower ranks among the energy sources with the lowest levels of greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy produced, but levels of emissions vary enormously between projects.[70] In 2020, hydropower supplied 17% of the world's electricity, down from a high of nearly 20% in the mid-to-late 20th century.[71][72] In conventional hydropower, a reservoir is created behind a dam. Conventional hydropower plants provide a highly flexible, dispatchable electricity supply and can be combined with wind and solar power to provide peak load and to compensate when wind and sun are less available.[73] In most conventional hydropower projects, the biological matter that becomes submerged in the reservoir's flooding decomposes, becoming a source of carbon dioxide and methane. The carbon footprint may be half of that of conventional fossil fuels.[74] Levels of these emissions are particularly high in tropical regions.[75] Deforestation and climate change can reduce energy generation from hydroelectric dams.[73] Depending on location, the implementing large-scale dams can displace residents and cause significant local environmental damage; potential dam failure could place the surrounding population at risk.[73] Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity facilities generally have less environmental impact than reservoir-based facilities, but their ability to generate power depends on river flow which can vary with daily and seasonal weather. Reservoirs provide water quantity controls that are used for flood control and flexible electricity generation output while also providing security during drought for drinking water supply and irrigation.[76] Geothermal[edit] Main articles: Geothermal power and Geothermal heating Cooling towers at a geothermal power plant in Larderello, Italy Geothermal energy is produced by tapping into the heat that exists below the earth's crust,[77] which can be harnessed for electricity generation and for heating. The use of geothermal energy is concentrated in regions where heat extraction is economical: a combination is needed of high temperatures, heat flow and permeability (the ability of the rock to allow fluids to pass through).[78] Power is produced via wells drilled into reservoirs. Fluids heat up underground, and can be captured as steam to drive a heat turbine.[79] Together with solar thermal, geothermal energy provided 2.2% of worldwide demand for heating in buildings in 2019.[80] Geothermal energy is a renewable resource because thermal energy is constantly replenished from neighbouring hotter regions and the radioactive decay of naturally occurring isotopes.[81] The median life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions of geothermal electric stations are less than 5% of carbon intensity of coal.[70] Geothermal energy carries a risk of inducing earthquakes, needs effective protection to avoid water pollution, and releases toxic emissions, which can be captured.[82] Bioenergy[edit] Main article: Bioenergy Further information: Sustainable biofuel Kenyan farmer lighting a biogas lamp. Biogas produced from biomass is a renewable energy source that can be used for cooking or to provide light. A sugarcane plantation to produce ethanol in Brazil Biomass is a versatile and common source of renewable energy. If the production of biomass is well-managed, carbon emissions can be significantly offset by the absorption of carbon dioxide by the plants during their lifespans.[83] Biomass can either be burned to produce heat and to generate electricity or converted to modern biofuels such as biodiesel and ethanol.[84][85] Biofuels are often produced from corn or sugar cane. They are used to power transport, often blended with liquid fossil fuels.[83] Use of farmland for growing biomass can result in less land being available for growing food. Since photosynthesis captures only a small fraction of the energy in sunlight and crops require significant amounts of energy to harvest, dry, and transport, a lot of land is needed to produce biomass.[86] If biomass is harvested from crops such as tree plantations, the cultivation of these crops can displace natural ecosystems, degrade soils and consume water resources and synthetic fertilisers.[87][88] Approximately one-third of all wood used for fuel is harvested unsustainably.[89] In some cases, these impacts can result in higher overall carbon emissions compared to using petroleum-based fuels.[88][90] In the United States, corn-based ethanol has replaced around 10% of motor gasoline, which requires a significant proportion of the yearly corn harvest.[91][92] In Malaysia and Indonesia, clearing forests to produce palm oil for biodiesel has led to serious social and environmental effects, as these forests are critical carbon sinks and habitats for endangered species.[93] More sustainable sources of biomass include algae, waste and crops grown on soil unsuitable for food production.[83] If the biomass source is agricultural or municipal waste, burning it or converting it into biogas provides a way to dispose of this waste.[87] Second-generation biofuels which are produced from non-food plants reduce competition with food production, but may have other negative effects including trade-offs with conservation areas and local air pollution.[83] Carbon capture and storage technology can be used to capture emissions from bioenergy power plants. This process is known as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and can result in net carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere. However, the BECCS process can also result in net positive emissions depending on how the biomass material is grown, harvested, and transported. Deployment of BECCS at scales described in some climate change mitigation pathways would also require converting large amounts of cropland.[94] Marine energy[edit] Main article: Marine energy Marine energy represents the smallest share of the energy market. It encompasses tidal power, which is approaching maturity and wave power, which is earlier in its development. Two tidal barrage systems, in France and in South Korea make up 90% of total production. While single marine energy devices pose little risk to the environment, the impacts of larger devices are less well known.[95] Non-renewable energy sources[edit] Fossil fuel switching and mitigation[edit] Switching from coal to gas has advantages in terms of sustainability. For a given unit of energy produced, the life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of natural gas are around 40 times the emissions of wind or nuclear energy, but are much less than coal. Natural gas produces around half the emissions of coal when used to generate electricity and around two-thirds the emissions of coal when used to produce heat. Reducing methane leaks in the process of extracting and transporting natural gas could further decrease its climate impact.[96] Natural gas produces less air pollution than coal.[97] Building gas-fired power plants and gas pipelines is promoted as a way to phase out coal and wood burning pollution and increase energy supply in some African countries with fast growing populations and economies,[98] but this practice is controversial. Developing natural gas infrastructure risks the creation of carbon lock-in and stranded assets, where new fossil infrastructure either commits to decades of carbon emissions, or has to be written off prematurely.[99] The greenhouse gas emissions of fossil fuel and biomass power plants can be significantly reduced through carbon capture and storage (CCS), however deployment of this technology is still very limited, with only 21 large-scale CCS plants in operation worldwide as of 2020.[100] The CCS process is expensive, with costs depending considerably on the location's proximity to suitable geology for carbon dioxide storage.[63][101] Most studies use a working assumption that CCS can capture 85–90% of the CO2 emissions from a power plant.[102][103] If 90% of emitted CO2 is captured from a coal-fired power plant, its uncaptured emissions would still be many times greater than the emissions of nuclear, solar or wind energy per unit of electricity produced.[104][105] Since coal plants using CCS would be less efficient, they would require more coal and thus increase the pollution associated with mining and transporting coal.[106] Nuclear power[edit] Main article: Nuclear power debate Since 1985, the proportion of electricity generated from low-carbon sources has barely increased. Advances in deploying renewables have been mostly offset by retirement of nuclear power plants.[107] Nuclear power plants have been used since the 1950s as a low-carbon source of baseload electricity.[108] Nuclear power plants in over 30 countries generate about 10% of global electricity,[109] and as of 2019, over a quarter of all low-carbon energy, the second largest source after hydropower.[110] Nuclear power's lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions—including the mining and processing of uranium—are similar to the emissions from renewable energy sources.[111] Nuclear power uses little land per unit of energy produced, compared to the major renewables,[112] and does not create local air pollution.[113] The uranium ore used to fuel nuclear fission plants is a non-renewable resource, but sufficient quantities exist to provide a supply for hundreds to thousands of years.[114][115] Climate change mitigation pathways consistent with ambitious goals typically see an increase in power supply from nuclear.[116] There is controversy over whether nuclear power can be considered sustainable.[117] Radioactive nuclear waste must be managed over multi-generation timescales[118] and nuclear power plants can create fissile material that could be used for nuclear weapon proliferation.[118] The perceived risk of nuclear accidents has a major influence on public opinion of nuclear energy,[118] although for each unit of energy produced, nuclear energy is far safer than fossil fuel energy and comparable to renewable sources.[119] Public opposition often makes nuclear plants politically difficult to implement.[118] Experts from the Joint Research Centre (JRC), the scientific expert arm of the EU, stated in April 2021 that nuclear power is ""sustainable"".[120] Two other groups of experts—SCHEER (Scientific Committee on Health, Environmental and Emerging Risks) and ""Article 31""—largely confirmed JRC findings in July 2021.[121] Reducing the time and the cost of building new nuclear plants have been goals for decades, but progress has been limited.[122][123] Various new forms of nuclear energy are in development, hoping to address the drawbacks of conventional plants. Fast breeder reactors are capable of recycling nuclear waste and therefore can significantly reduce the amount of waste that requires geological disposal but have not yet been deployed on a large-scale commercial basis.[124] Nuclear power based on thorium, rather than uranium, may be able to provide higher energy security for countries that do not have a large supply of uranium.[125] Small modular reactors may have several advantages over current large reactors: it should be possible to build them faster, and their modularization would allow for cost reductions via learning-by-doing.[126] Several countries are attempting to develop nuclear fusion reactors, which would generate small amounts of waste and no risk of explosions.[127] Energy system transformation[edit] Main article: Energy transition Energy use in industry caused 24.2% of all GHG emissions in 2016. Energy use in buildings and transport caused 17.5% and 16.2% of emissions, respectively. Another 15.3% of emissions came from other energy use and fugitive emissions from the production of energy.[128] The emissions reductions necessary to keep global warming below 2 °C will require a system-wide transformation of the way energy is produced, distributed, stored, and consumed.[13] For a society to replace one form of energy with another, multiple technologies and behaviours in the energy system must change. For example, transitioning from oil to solar power as the energy source for automobiles requires the generation of solar electricity, modifications to the electrical grid to accommodate fluctuations in solar panel output and higher overall demand, adoption of electric cars, and the development of a network of vehicle rechargers and repair shops.[129] Many climate change mitigation scenarios envision that the energy system will use low-emission energy sources to produce electricity, and also that electricity will be increasingly used as a substitute for the direct burning of fossil fuels.[130] For energy-intensive technologies and processes that are difficult to electrify, there are several options. Biofuels and synthetic carbon-neutral fuels can power many vehicles that are designed to burn fossil fuels, however biofuels cannot be sustainably produced in the quantities needed and synthetic fuels are currently very expensive.[131] For some applications, the most prominent alternative to electrification is to develop a system based on sustainably-produced hydrogen fuel.[132] In addition to electrification, climate change mitigation scenarios envision accelerated adoption of energy efficiency measures.[130] Full decarbonization of the global energy system is expected to take several decades and can mostly be achieved by deploying existing technology.[129] The International Energy Agency states that further innovation in the energy sector, such as in battery technologies and carbon-neutral fuels, is needed to reach net-zero emissions in 2050.[133] Development of new technologies requires research and development, demonstration and cost reductions via deployment.[133] A woman in rural Rajasthan (India) collects firewood for cooking. Firewood is labour-intensive to gather and causes harmful indoor and outdoor air pollution.The transition to a zero-carbon energy system would bring strong co-benefits for human health: The WHO estimates that efforts to limit global warming to 1.5 °C could save millions of lives each year from air pollution alone.[134][135] With responsible planning and management, pathways exist to provide universal access to electricity and clean cooking by 2030 in ways that are consistent with climate goals.[136][137] Historically, several countries have made rapid economic gains through coal usage, particularly in Asia.[136] However, there remains a window of opportunity for many poor countries and regions to ""leapfrog"" fossil fuel dependency by developing their energy systems based on renewables, given adequate international investment and knowledge transfer.[136] Integrating variable energy sources[edit] Buildings in the Solar Settlement at Schlierberg, Germany, produce more energy than they consume. They incorporate rooftop solar panels and are built for maximum energy efficiency. To deliver reliable electricity from variable renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, electrical power systems will need to become more flexible.[138] Most electrical grids were constructed for non-intermittent energy sources such as coal-fired power plants.[139] As larger amounts of solar and wind energy are integrated into the grid, changes have to be made to the energy system to ensure that the supply of electricity is matched to demand.[140] In 2019, these sources generated 8.5% of worldwide electricity, a share that has grown rapidly.[51] There are various ways to make the electricity system more flexible. In many places, wind and solar production are complementary on a daily and a seasonal scale: There is more wind during the night and in winter when solar energy production is low.[140] Linking different geographical regions through long-distance transmission lines allows for further cancelling out of variability.[141] Energy demand can be shifted in time through energy demand management and the use of smart grids, matching the times when variable energy production is highest. With grid energy storage, energy produced in excess can be released when needed.[140] Further flexibility could be provided from sector coupling, i.e. coupling the electricity sector to the heat and mobility sector via power-to-heat-systems and electric vehicles.[142] Building overcapacity for wind and solar generation can help to ensure that enough electricity is produced even during poor weather – during optimal weather energy generation may have to be curtailed, if excess electricity cannot be used or stored. The final demand-supply mismatch may be covered by using dispatchable energy sources such as hydropower, bioenergy, or natural gas.[143] Energy storage[edit] Main articles: Energy storage and Grid energy storage Construction of salt tanks to store thermal energy Energy storage helps overcome barriers for intermittent renewable energy and is an important aspect of a sustainable energy system.[144] The most commonly used storage method is pumped-storage hydroelectricity, which requires locations with large differences in height and access to water.[144] Batteries, and specifically lithium-ion batteries whose costs have been coming down rapidly, are also deployed widely.[145] Batteries typically store electricity for short periods; research is ongoing into technology with sufficient capacity to last through seasons.[146] Pumped hydro storage and power-to-gas (converting electricity to gas, and back) with capacity for multi-month usage has been implemented in some locations.[147][148] Electrification[edit] Main article: Electrification The outdoor section of a heat pump. Emissions from heating buildings can be significantly reduced by using heat pumps instead of oil or gas boilers.[149] As of 2019, 37% of global electricity is produced from low-carbon sources, i.e. renewables and nuclear energy.[150] Fossil fuels, primarily coal, produce the rest of the electricity supply.[150] One of the easiest and fastest ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is to phase out coal-fired power plants and increase renewable electricity generation.[130] As of 2018, about a quarter of all electricity generation came from renewable sources other than biomass.[151] In addition to decarbonizing the generation of electricity, climate change mitigation scenarios envision extensive electrification — the use of electricity as a substitute for the direct burning of fossil fuels.[130] Many options exist to produce electricity sustainably, but producing fuels or heat on a large scale sustainably is relatively difficult.[152] Ambitious climate policy would see a doubling of energy consumed as electricity by 2050, from 20% in 2020.[153] One of the challenges in providing universal access to electricity is distributing power to rural areas. Off-grid and mini-grid systems based on renewable energy, such as small solar PV installations that generate and store enough electricity for a village, are important solutions.[154] Wider access to reliable electricity would lead to less use of kerosene lighting and diesel generators, which are currently common in the developing world.[155] Infrastructure for generating and storing renewable electricity requires minerals and metals, such as cobalt and lithium for batteries and copper for solar panels.[156] Recycling can meet some of this demand if product lifecycles are well-designed, however achieving net zero emissions would still require major increases in mining for 17 types of metals and minerals.[156] A small group of countries or companies sometimes dominate the markets for these commodities raising geopolitical concerns.[157] Cobalt, for instance, is mined in Congo, a politically unstable region where mining is often associated with human rights risks. More diverse geographical sourcing may ensure the stability of the supply chain.[158][159] Hydrogen[edit] Main articles: Hydrogen economy, Hydrogen fuel, and Hydrogen storage Hydrogen is a gas that can be burned to produce heat or can power fuel cells to generate electricity, with zero emissions at the point of usage. The overall lifecycle emissions of hydrogen depend on how it is produced. Very little of the world's current supply of hydrogen is currently created from sustainable sources.[160] The predominant reaction route is steam methane reforming in which hydrogen is produced from a chemical reaction between steam and methane, which is derived from natural gas. Producing one tonne of hydrogen through this process emits 6.6–9.3 tonnes of carbon dioxide.[161] While carbon capture can remove a large fraction of these emissions, the overall carbon footprint of hydrogen from natural gas is difficult to assess as of 2021[update], in part because of emissions due to the production of the natural gas itself.[162] Another more sustainable approach for hydrogen production is through electrolysis, by using electricity to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen; if the electricity is generated sustainably, the resultant fuel will also be sustainable. This process is currently more expensive than creating hydrogen from fossil fuels, and the efficiency of energy conversion is inherently low.[132] Hydrogen can be produced when there is a surplus of intermittent renewable electricity, then stored and used to generate heat or to re-generate electricity.[163] It can be further transformed into synthetic fuels such as ammonia and methanol, or into feedstock for the chemical industry, indirectly electrifying those applications.[164] This dual character of hydrogen, both a chemical reagent and as an energy carrier, makes it likely hydrogen use will expand in the coming decades.[161] Innovation in hydrogen electrolysers could make large-scale production of hydrogen from electricity more cost-competitive.[165] There is potential for hydrogen to play a significant role in decarbonising energy systems because in certain sectors, replacing fossil fuels with direct use of electricity would be very difficult.[132] Hydrogen fuel can produce the intense heat required for industrial production of steel, cement, glass, and chemicals. For steelmaking, hydrogen can function as a clean energy carrier and simultaneously as a low-carbon catalyst replacing coal-derived coke.[166] Energy usage technologies[edit] Transport[edit] Utility cycling infrastructure, such as this bike lane in Vancouver, encourages sustainable transport. Main article: Sustainable transport There are multiple ways to make transport more sustainable. Public transport frequently emits fewer greenhouse gases per passenger than personal vehicles, especially with high occupancy.[167][168] High-speed rail journeys, which use much less fuel, can replace short-distance flights.[169][170] Stimulating non-motorised transport such as walking and cycling, particularly in cities, can make transport cleaner and healthier.[171][172] The energy efficiency of cars has increased because of technological progress,[173] but shifting to electric vehicles is an important further step towards decarbonising transport and reducing air pollution.[174] A large proportion of traffic-related air pollution consists of particulate matter from road dust and the wearing-down of tyres and brake pads.[175] Substantially reducing pollution from these sources cannot be achieved by electrification; it requires measures such as making vehicles lighter and driving them less.[176] Making freight transport sustainable is challenging.[177] Hydrogen vehicles may be an option for larger vehicles such as lorries which have not yet been widely electrified because of the weight of batteries needed for long-distance travel.[178] Many of the techniques needed to lower emissions from shipping and aviation are still early in their development, with clean ammonia a promising candidate for shipping fuel.[179] Aviation biofuel may be one of the better uses of bioenergy, providing some carbon is captured and stored during manufacture of the fuel.[180] Buildings and cooking[edit] Further information: Renewable heat, Green building, and Energy poverty and cooking Passive cooling features, such as these windcatcher towers in Iran, bring cool air into buildings without any use of energy.[181] For cooking, electric induction stoves are one of the most energy-efficient and safest options.[182][183] For heating buildings, alternatives to burning fossil fuels and biomass include electrification (heat pumps, or the less efficient electric heater), geothermal, solar thermal, and waste heat.[184][185][186] Seasonal thermal energy storage has been implemented in some high-latitude regions for household heating.[187] Heat pumps currently provide only 5% of space and water heating requirements globally, but the IEA estimates they could provide over 90%.[188] In densely populated urban areas, space for heat pumps may be limited and district heating may better meet demand.[189] While traditionally using mostly fossil fuels, modern and cold district heating systems are designed to use lower temperatures, high shares of renewable energy such as central solar heating and geothermal energy and waste heat to provide low-carbon heating.[190][191] The costs of all these technologies strongly depend on location, and uptake of the technology sufficient for deep decarbonisation requires stringent policy interventions.[186] Efficient cooling of buildings requires passive building design and urban planning, in addition to air conditioning, which requires electrification and additional power demand and is therefore not always accessible for poorer households. Some air conditioning units use refrigerants which warm the climate: replacing those with climate-friendly refrigerants, as required under the internationally agreed Kigali Amendment, would reduce the climate impacts of cooling.[192] In developing countries where populations suffer from energy poverty, polluting fuels such as wood or animal dung are often used for cooking. Cooking with these fuels is generally unsustainable because it causes harmful smoke and because the harvesting of wood can lead to forest degradation.[193] The universal adoption of clean cooking facilities, which are already ubiquitous in rich countries,[182] would dramatically improve health and have minimal effects on climate.[194][195][196] Clean cooking facilities typically use natural gas, LPG, or electricity as the energy source; biogas systems are a promising alternative in some contexts.[182] Improved cookstoves that burn biomass more efficiently than traditional stoves are an interim solution where transitioning to clean cooking systems is difficult.[197] Industry[edit] Over one-third of energy use is by industry. Most of that energy is deployed in thermal processes: generating steam, drying, and refrigeration. The share of renewable energy in industry was 14.5% in 2017—mostly low-temperature heat supplied by bioenergy and electricity. The more energy-intensive activities in industry have the lowest shares of renewable energy, as they face limitations in generating heat at temperatures over 200 °C (390 °F).[198] For some industrial processes, such as steel production, commercialisation of technologies that have not yet been built or operated at full scale will be needed to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions.[199] The production of plastic, cement and fertilizers also requires significant amounts of energy, with limited possibilities available to decarbonise.[200] A switch to a circular economy would make industry more sustainable, as it involves recycling more and thereby using less energy compared to extracting new raw materials.[201] Government policies[edit] Further information: Politics of climate change and Energy policy Several countries and the European Union have committed to dates for all new cars to be zero-emissions vehicles.[202] Well-designed government policies that promote energy system transformation can lower greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality simultaneously, and in many cases can also increase energy security.[203] Energy-specific programs and regulations have historically been the mainstays of efforts to reduce fossil fuel emissions.[204] Some governments have committed to dates for phasing out coal-fired power plants, ending new fossil fuel exploration, requiring that new passenger vehicles produce zero emissions, and requiring new buildings to be heated by electricity instead of gas.[202] Renewable portfolio standards have been enacted in several countries requiring utilities to increase the percentage of electricity they generate from renewable sources.[205][206] Governments can accelerate energy system transformation by leading the development of infrastructure such as long-distance electrical transmission lines, smart grids and hydrogen pipelines.[207] In transport, appropriate infrastructure and incentives can make travel more efficient and less car-dependent.[203] Urban planning to discourage sprawl can reduce energy use in local transport and buildings while enhancing quality of life.[203] Financial incentives may be useful to encourage research, development, and demonstration of newer technologies such as low-carbon fuels, and to create a level playing field with mature fossil fuel-based technologies.[208] Carbon pricing is an approach that gives industries and consumers an incentive to reduce emissions, while giving them flexibility in how to do so, e.g. by shifting to low-emission energy sources, improving energy efficiency, or buying fewer energy-intensive products and services. Carbon pricing has encountered strong political pushback in some jurisdictions, whereas energy-specific policies tend to be politically safer.[204] Most studies indicate that to limit global warming to 1.5 °C, carbon pricing would need to be complemented by stringent energy-specific policies.[209] As of 2019, carbon pricing covers about 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions; in most of these cases the price on carbon is lower than what would be needed to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement.[210] Carbon taxes provide a source of revenue that can be used to lower other taxes[211] or to help lower-income households afford higher energy costs.[212] The scale and pace of policy reforms that have been initiated as of 2020 are far less than needed to fulfil the climate goals of the Paris Agreement.[213][214] In addition to domestic policies, greater international cooperation will be required to accelerate innovation and to assist poorer countries in establishing a sustainable path to full energy access.[215] Countries may pursue policy to stimulate renewables for the creation of jobs.[216] The International Labour Organization estimates that efforts to limit global warming to 2 °C would result in net job creation in most sectors of the economy.[217] It predicts that 24 million new jobs would be created in areas such as renewable electricity generation, improving energy-efficiency in buildings and the transition to electric vehicles, while 6 million jobs in the fossil fuel industry would be lost.[217] Governments can make the transition to sustainable energy more politically and socially feasible by ensuring a just transition for workers and regions that depend on the fossil fuel industry to ensure they have alternative economic opportunities.[136] Finance[edit] Further information: Climate finance Electrified heat and transport are key parts of investment for the renewable energy transition. Mobilising sufficient finance for innovation and investment is a prerequisite for the energy transition.[218] The IPCC estimates that to limit global warming to 1.5 °C, US$2.4 trillion would need to be invested in the energy system each year between 2016 and 2035. Most studies project that these costs, equivalent to 2.5 percent of world GDP, would be small compared to the economic and health benefits.[219] Average annual investment in low-carbon energy technologies and energy efficiency would need to be upscaled by roughly a factor of six by 2050 compared to 2015.[220] Underfunding is particularly acute in the least developed countries.[221] The Paris Agreement includes a pledge of additional funds for poorer countries of $100 billion per year, but this goals has not been achieved. The mobilised money reaches poorer countries via more than a hundred channels often controlled by rich countries.[222] The UNFCCC estimates that climate financing totalled $681 billion in 2016,[223] with most of this being private-sector investment in renewable energy deployment, public-sector investment in sustainable transport and private-sector investment in energy efficiency.[224] Fossil fuel funding and subsidies form a significant barrier to the energy transition.[225][218] Direct global fossil fuel subsidies reached $319 billion in 2017, and $5.2 trillion when indirect costs such as air pollution are priced in.[226] Ending these could lead to a 28% reduction in global carbon emissions and a 46% reduction in air pollution deaths.[227] Funding for clean energy has been largely unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic and required economic stimulus packages offer possibilities for a green recovery.[228][229] See also[edit] Low-carbon economy Timeline of sustainable energy research 2020–present References[edit] Notes[edit] ^ Ritchie, Hannah (10 February 2020).

Renewable Energy vs Sustainable Energy: What’s the Difference? 2 July, 2021 Solving the energy crisis is one of the most essential undertakings of the 21st century. Perfect solutions will be hard to come by, due not only to drastic differences in political and public support for sustainable energy throughout the world, but the extensive knowledge required to address the many challenges associated with the global energy landscape. “Renewable energy” and “sustainable energy” are often used interchangeably, even among industry experts and veterans. There is some overlap between the two, as many sustainable energy sources are also renewable. However, these two terms are not exactly the same. A clear understanding of renewable energy versus sustainable energy can help: Students make the right college and career choices based on their interests Energy industry leaders make the correct decisions based on their organizational objectives Policymakers craft appropriate, effective legislation Consumers advocate for and adopt the energy methods they find most suitable Renewable energy … Sustainable energy … Comes from sources that naturally renew themselves at a rate that allows us to meet our energy needs Includes biomass, geothermal, hydropower, solar and wind Not all renewable energy is also sustainable, but improving the sustainability of renewables and fossil fuels can have environmental benefits Comes from sources that can fulfill our current energy needs without compromising future generations Also involves collection and distribution; the energy must be efficiently acquired and distributed in order to be sustainable Includes geothermal, hydropower, solar and wind. What Is Renewable Energy? Produced from existing resources that naturally sustain or replenish themselves over time, renewable energy can be a much more abiding solution than our current top energy sources. Unlike fossil fuels, renewables are increasingly cost-efficient, and their impact on the environment is far less severe. By taking advantage of the earth’s ability to grow and recycle organisms, renewable power sources will theoretically be able to supply our energy needs indefinitely. Renewable energy is defined by the time it takes to replenish the primary energy resource, compared to the rate at which energy is used. This is why traditional resources like coal and oil, which take millions of years to form, are not considered renewable. On the other hand, solar power can always be replenished, even though conditions are not always optimal for maximizing production. Under this definition, examples of renewable energy sources include: Biomass: Organic material that is burned or converted to liquid or gaseous form. Biomass from trees was the leading source of energy in the United States before the mass adoption of fossil fuels. Modern examples of biomass include ethanol and biodiesel, which are collectively referred to as biofuels. Geothermal: Heat produced by decaying radioactive particles found deep within the earth. Geothermal energy can be used as a direct heat source or to generate electricity. Hydropower: One of the oldest sources of electricity, requiring not only massive amounts of water but also a formidable amount of force. Hydropower was the largest source of renewable electricity until 2019. Solar: A favored green alternative, although production requires a large surface area and consistent sunlight. Solar farms should be combined with storage solutions in order to harness the sun’s potential. Like geothermal energy, solar power is often used as a direct heat source and electricity generator. Wind: Utilizes turbines to convert the wind’s kinetic energy into mechanical energy, which is then used to accomplish a task like grinding rain. Alternatively, the mechanical energy can be rotated at high speeds to produce electricity. What Is Sustainable Energy? Sustainable energy is derived from resources that can maintain current operations without jeopardizing the energy needs or climate of future generations. The most popular sources of sustainable energy, including wind, solar and hydropower, are also renewable. Biofuel is a unique form of renewable energy, as its consumption emits climate-affecting greenhouse gasses, and growing the original plant product uses up other environmental resources. However, biofuel remains a major part of the green revolution. The key challenge with biofuel is finding ways to maximize energy output while minimizing the impact of sourcing biomass and burning the fuel. Even with resources that are both renewable and sustainable, like wind and solar power, an important question remains: Is sustainable energy the solution to our energy and climate needs? It is a promising but nuanced option, and the answer isn’t as simple as transitioning from so-called “dirty” resources to sustainable ones. In addition to the biomatter conundrum, not all sustainable solutions can be used in every situation. Their efficiency and/or effectiveness depends on factors such as climate and location, and once the energy is generated, collected and stored, it must then be distributed. For instance, wind is produced by temperature changes in the air, which aren’t consistent across the planet. In the U.S., this means that the best place to put wind farms is in the Midwest, the Texas region, or offshore. How do we ensure this energy fairly provides for other regions, like the Northeast? Furthermore, disparities in regulations and target goals can create a problem where the best place to produce energy may not have the public interest or infrastructure necessary to support it. For example, a windy state may struggle to pass legislation for financing the construction of turbines, while its neighbor may be eager for a nearby source of clean energy. How do we navigate such situations in a way that allows consumers to get what they want, no matter where they live? Answering these and other questions requires the advanced critical thinking skills and social, political and economic awareness that a master’s degree in sustainable energy can provide. It will take more to support widespread adoption of renewable and sustainable resources than technical knowledge alone. The Renewable Energy vs. Sustainable Energy Debate Energy leaders need to not only understand the nuances between these two terms, but be mindful of how they use them in legislation and organizational decision-making. Not only will the precise use of language benefit consumers, allowing them to understand the implications of their energy choices, but it will also help officials ensure their policies accurately reflect their objectives. For example, a policymaker who drafts a green bill only using the term “renewable energy” may subvert the effect of their own legislation by failing to account for the potential environmental impact of energy sources like biofuels. Additionally, by using these terms appropriately, energy leaders can be sure to craft initiatives that align with the ideals of the public, thereby increasing the chances of receiving public backing. Support for greener energy sources is high: As of 2017, 82% of people worldwide agree that the world should be fully powered by renewable energy. Researchers found this support consistent across people of different ages, education levels and political ideologies. Renewable energy has bipartisan support in the U.S., although reasoning differs among political lines. Generally, Republicans are interested in the economic benefits of renewables, while Democrats are more focused on climate change. Even with these two differences—or perhaps because of them, with the Democratic concern making the case for sustainable options—such overwhelming support suggests a positive future for sustainable energy, as well as a need for legislators, private sector decision-makers and non-profit leaders to develop comprehensive strategies for moving forward. The question then becomes: How do we go from simply supporting sustainable energy to widespread adoption? The answer is multifaceted, but higher education plays a significant role. Energy professionals must understand how energy creation, distribution and consumption are affected by factors such as: Geography: Where and how can we obtain energy in ways that provide for efficient use, reduce environmental impact and remain cost-effective? Economics: How do we finance the transition to sustainable energy sources? How does the cost of creating and distributing sustainable energy affect the rate of adoption? What about areas with little money to invest in sustainable energy? Availability: How do we provide sustainable energy to areas less likely to produce it? How do we account for the earth’s natural shifts in resources when quantifying and meeting our energy needs? Politics: How do we navigate political interests and arguments for and against sustainable energy? Even those currently in the industry may find themselves bewildered by the field’s rapid pace and myriad influences. They need the opportunity to build on their existing knowledge and skills in order to address the needs of now and the future. A master’s degree can introduce energy sector professionals, both experienced and new, to the various issues surrounding the energy crisis. Successfully completing courses that cover multiple aspects of the energy industry, including but not limited to its organization, markets, end-use, policy, financing and global governance, prepares students to tackle some of the biggest energy and climate challenges of today and tomorrow.

Its goal is to improve youth participation and youth empowerment as it relates to advancing sustainable development. SustainUS works particularly with youth and young people aged 13–29 and on United Nations conferences related to youth and/or sustainability. SustainUS has helped to create youth coalitions in the United States and internationally and has gained particular attention for its climate change advocacy and for being entirely youth-run. Contents 1 History 2 Programs 3 References 4 External links History[edit] SustainUS was founded in May 2001 at the International Youth Summit in Borgholm, Sweden, to prepare U.S. youth for the World Summit on Sustainable Development.[2] Programs[edit] SustainUS operates several programs: Agents of Change (AoC), begun in 2003, brings delegations of U.S.-based youth to conferences and summits related to international sustainability policy, primarily at the United Nations. Youth delegates work with government delegates, fellow civil society members, and other youth to promote cooperation, focusing on youth-friendly and future-oriented policies. AoC has been active at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change since at least 2005, also the International Forum on the Eradication of Poverty, the Commission for Social Development, Commission on the Status of Women, and the Commission on Sustainable Development. Citizen Science is a nationwide youth-led citizen science initiative committed to providing a platform for young scientists and engineers to engage in policy discourse and share scientific knowledge as it relates to sustainable development. The primary goal is to raise the awareness of United States' citizens regarding existing and emerging technologies designed to improve economic, social, and environmental conditions for not only current, but future generations as well. Citizen Science attempts to bring together the many fields of science into a holistic scientific forum to support and disseminate the principles of sustainable development. Citizen Science holds an annual paper competition based upon the discussion topics of the upcoming Commission on Sustainable Development. The purpose of the competition is to make technical aspects of those topics relevant and understandable to the general public and influence sound public policy. Competition winners have their work published in the journal Citizen Science, and present to activists and policy-makers at the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development at the UN Headquarters in New York City as a member of the UN youth delegation. Lead Now Fellowship, begun in 2012, trains, supports, and inspires youth to become leaders in advancing sustainable development. SustainUS offers a small group of fellows individualized mentorship, trainings, and resources to develop their leadership skills and apply them to a sustainable development initiative that they are leading.

Swarthmore also is affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania through the Quaker Consortium, which allows for students to cross-register for classes at all four institutions.[10] Swarthmore offers over 600 courses per year in more than 40 areas of study, including an ABET-accredited engineering program that culminates in a Bachelor of Science in engineering.[11] Swarthmore has a variety of sporting teams with a total of 22 Division III Intercollegiate sports teams, and it competes in the Centennial Conference, a group of private colleges in Pennsylvania and Maryland.[12] The school's alumni have attained prominence in a broad range of fields. Graduates include five Nobel Prize winners (as of 2016[update], the third-highest number of Nobel Prize winners per graduate in the U.S.),[13] 11 MacArthur Foundation fellows, 30 Rhodes Scholars, 27 Truman Scholars, 10 Marshall Scholars, and 201 Fulbright Grantees.

Alice Paul and David Kemp, two of the newer buildings, won the American Institute of Architects Housing Awards in 2010.[14] The name ""Swarthmore"" has its roots in early Quaker history. In England, Swarthmoor Hall near the town of Ulverston, Cumbria, (previously in Lancashire), was the home of Thomas and Margaret Fell in 1652 when George Fox, (1624–1691), fresh from his epiphany atop Pendle Hill in 1651, came to visit. The visitation turned into a long association, as Fox persuaded Thomas and Margaret Fell of his views. Swarthmore was used for the first meetings of what became known as the Religious Society of Friends (later colloquially labeled ""The Quakers""). The College was founded in 1864 by Deborah Fisher Wharton, along with her industrialist son, Joseph Wharton, together with a committee of members of the Hicksite Yearly Meetings of Philadelphia, New York and Baltimore. It is the only college founded by the Hicksite branch of the Society of Friends: previous Quaker institutions, like nearby Haverford College, were Orthodox in their founding history. Swarthmore held its first classes in 1869[8] and Edward Parrish (1822–1872) was the first president. Lucretia Mott (1793–1880) and Martha Ellicott Tyson (1795–1873)[15][16] were among those Friends who insisted that the new college of Swarthmore be coeducational. Edward Hicks Magill, the second president, served for 17 years.[17] His daughter, Helen Magill, (1853–1944), was in the first class to graduate in 1873; in 1877, she was the first woman in the United States to earn a Doctor of Philosophy degree, (Ph.D.); hers was in Greek from Boston University in Boston, Massachusetts.[18] Around 11 p.m. on September 25, 1881, a fire occurred in Parrish Hall, destroying all but the exterior of the building. Parrish Hall reopened on January 18, 1883.[8] In the early 1900s, the College had a major collegiate American football program during the formation period of the soon-to-be nationwide sport (playing Navy, Princeton, Columbia, and other larger schools) and an active fraternity and sorority life.[19] The 1921 appointment of Frank Aydelotte as president began the development of the school's current academic focus, particularly with his vision for the Honors program based on his experience as a Rhodes Scholar.[20] During World War II, Swarthmore was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program, which offered students a path to a U.S. Navy commission.[21] Wolfgang Köhler, Hans Wallach and Solomon Asch were noted psychologists who became professors at Swarthmore, a center for Gestalt psychology. Both Wallach, who was Jewish, and Köhler, who was not, had left Nazi Germany because of its discriminatory policies against Jews. Köhler came to Swarthmore in 1935 and served until his retirement in 1958. Wallach came in 1936, first as a researcher, and also teaching from 1942 until 1975. Asch, who was Polish-American and had immigrated as a child to the US in 1920, joined the faculty in 1947 and served until 1966, conducting his noted conformity experiments at Swarthmore.[22] The 1960s and 1970s saw the construction of new buildings: Sharples Dining Hall in 1964, Worth Health Center in 1965, the Dana/Hallowell Residence Halls in 1967, and Lang Music Building in 1973.[8] They also saw a 1967 review of the college initiated by President Courtney Smith, a Black protest movement, in which African-American students conducted an eight-day sit-in in the admissions office in 1969 to demand increased Black enrollment, and the establishment of both a Black Cultural Center (1970) and Women's Resource Center (1974).[8][23][24] The Environmental Studies program and the Intercultural Center were established in 1992, and in 1993 the Lang Performing Arts Center was opened; the Kohlberg Hall was then established in 1996 and a renovation of the Trotter hall was undertaken in 1997.[8] In 1999 the college began purchasing renewable energy credits in the form of wind power, and in the 2002–2003 academic year it constructed its first green roof.[8] In 2008, Swarthmore's first mascot, Phineas the Phoenix, made its debut.[8] Academics[edit] Observatory Swarthmore's Oxbridge tutorial-inspired Honors Program allows students to take double-credit seminars from their third year, and they often write honors theses. Seminars are usually composed of four to eight students. Students in seminars will usually write at least three 10-page papers per seminar, and often one of these papers is expanded into a 20–30 page paper by the end of the seminar. At the end of their final year, Honors students take oral and written examinations conducted by outside experts in their field. Usually one student in each discipline is awarded ""Highest Honors""; others are either awarded ""High Honors"" or ""Honors""; rarely, a student is denied Honors altogether by the outside examiner. Each department usually has a grade threshold for admission to the Honors program.[25] Uncommon for a liberal arts college, Swarthmore has an engineering program in which, at the completion of four years' work, students are granted a B.S. in Engineering. Other notable programs include minors in peace and conflict studies, cognitive science, and interpretation theory.[11] Swarthmore has a total undergraduate student enrollment of 1,620 (for the 2016–2017 year) and 187 faculty members (99% with a terminal degree), for a student-faculty ratio of 8:1. The small college offers more than 600 courses per year in over 40 courses of study.[26] Swarthmore has a reputation as a very academically oriented college, with 66% of students participating in undergraduate research or independent creative projects, and 90% of graduates eventually attending graduate or professional school. Rankings[edit] Academic rankings National ARWU[27] 155–175 Forbes[28] 25 THE/WSJ[29] 28 Global ARWU[30] 601–700 Liberal arts colleges U.S. News & World Report[31] 3 Washington Monthly[32] 15 Some sources, including Greene's Guides,[33] have termed Swarthmore one of the ""Little Ivies"". In its 2019 college ranking, U.S. News & World Report ranked Swarthmore as the third-best liberal arts college in the nation, behind Williams and Amherst and tied with Wellesley.[34] Since the inception of the ""U.S. News"" rankings, Amherst, Williams, and Swarthmore are the only colleges to have been ranked for the number one liberal arts college. Swarthmore has been ranked the number one liberal arts college in the country a total of six times.[35] In its 2019 ranking of 650 U.S. colleges, universities and service academies, Forbes magazine ranked Swarthmore twenty-fifth.[36] Swarthmore ranked fourth among all institutions of higher education in the United States as measured by the percentage of graduates who went on to earn Ph.D.s between 2002–2011.[37] In 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2013,[38] Swarthmore was named the #1 ""Best Value"" private college by The Princeton Review.[39] Overall selection criteria included more than 30 factors in three areas: academics, costs and financial aid. Swarthmore was also placed on The Princeton Review's Financial Aid Honor Roll along with twelve other institutions for receiving the highest possible rating in its ranking methodology.[40] Admissions[edit] Admission Statistics 2018[41][42] 2017[43][44] 2016[45] 2015[46] 2014[47] Applicants 10,749 9,383 7,717 7,818 5,540 Admits 1,016 1,004 988 976 943 Admit rate 9.45% 10.7% 12.8% 12.5% 17.0% Enrolled 422 399 415 407 407 SAT range (Critical Reading + Math) N/A 1370–1540 1305–1530 1340–1530 1360–1540 ACT range N/A 31–34 30–34 30–34 29–34 The college is considered by U.S. News & World Report as ""most selective,” with 10.7% accepted of the 9,383 applicants during the 2016–2017 admissions cycle.[44] The number of applicants was the highest in the college's history and among the highest overall of any liberal arts college.[48][49][50][51] The college saw increases in the number of underrepresented students, first generation college students, and international students. The college reports that ""Twenty-five percent of the admitted students are among the first generation in their family to attend college"" and ""Of the admitted students attending high schools reporting class rank, 94 percent are in the top decile"".[43] The 2018 admission statistics are only partially released; it is known so far that 10,749 applicants resulted in 1,016 admits for an admit rate of 9.45%.[41][42] In 2012, The Princeton Review gave Swarthmore a 99 out of 99 on their Admissions Selectivity Rating.[52] Graduates[edit] At Swarthmore, 16% of earners of undergraduate degrees immediately enter graduate or professional school, and, within five years of graduation, 77% of alumni enter these programs. Alumni of the school earn graduate degrees most commonly at institutions that include University of California-Berkeley, University of Michigan, Harvard, Columbia, New York University, University of Pennsylvania, Cambridge University, Oxford University, Johns Hopkins, Stanford, and Yale.[53] At graduate programs, the most common fields for Swarthmore graduates to enter are humanities, math & physical sciences, life sciences, and social sciences.[53] PayScale reports that Swarthmore graduates have an average starting salary of $61,300 and an average mid-career salary of $130,900, making their salaries 39th highest among all colleges and universities, and 10th among liberal arts colleges alone.[54][55] Endowment and tuition fees[edit] The cost of tuition, student activity fees, room, and board for the 2017–2018 academic year was $65,774 (tuition fees alone were $50,424).[26] The college meets 100% of admitted student demonstrated need without use of student loans, an important distinction from the many schools that meet 100% of demonstrated need, but only through loans (which must be repaid) rather than institutional grant- and scholarship-based funding (which does not require repayment). In total, 56% of the student body receives financial aid, and the average financial aid award was $50,361 during the 2017–18 year.[7] As a need-blind school, Swarthmore makes admission decisions and financial aid decisions independently. Operating revenue for the 2016 fiscal year was $148,086,000, over 50% of which was provided by the endowment.[7] Swarthmore ended a $230 million capital campaign on October 6, 2006, when President Bloom declared the project completed, three months ahead of schedule. The campaign, christened the ""Meaning of Swarthmore"", had been underway officially since the fall of 2001. 87% of the college's alumni participated in the effort. Swarthmore's endowment at the end of the 2019 fiscal year was $2.13 billion. Endowment per student was $1,370,157 for the same year, one of the highest rates in the country.[3] At the end of 2007, the Swarthmore Board of Managers approved the decision for the college to eliminate student loans from all financial aid packages. Instead, additional aid scholarships are granted.[56] Campus[edit] Parrish Hall from Magill Walk The campus consists of 425 acres (1.72 km2), based on a north-south axis anchored by Parrish Hall, which houses numerous administrative offices and student lounges, as well as two floors of student housing. The fourth floor houses campus radio station WSRN-FM as well as the weekly student newspaper, The Phoenix. Many acres are wooded and include trails. From the SEPTA Swarthmore commuter train station and the ""ville"" or borough of Swarthmore to the south, the oak-lined Magill Walk leads north up a hill to Parrish. The campus is coterminous with the grounds of the Scott Arboretum, cited by some as a main staple of the campus's renowned beauty.[57] In 2011, Travel+Leisure named Swarthmore one of the most beautiful college campuses in the United States.[58] The majority of the buildings housing classrooms and department offices are located to the north of Parrish, as are Kyle and Woolman dormitories. McCabe Library is to the east of Parrish, as are the dorms Willets, Mertz, Worth, The Lodges, Alice Paul, and David Kemp. To the west are the dorms Wharton, Dana, Hallowell, and Danawell, along with the Scott Amphitheater, an open wooded outdoor amphitheater, in which graduations and college collections (meetings) are held. The Crum Woods extend westward from the main campus, and many buildings on the forest side of the campus incorporate views of the woods. South of Parrish are Sharples dining hall and other smaller buildings. Palmer, Pittenger, and Roberts dormitories are south of the railroad station, as are the athletic facilities, while the Mary Lyon dorm is off-campus to the southwest.[59] The College has three main libraries (McCabe Library, the Cornell Library of Science and Engineering, and the Underhill Music and Dance Library) and seven other specialized collections.[60] Since 1923, McCabe library has been a Federal Depository library for selected U.S. Government documents. The birthplace of American artist Benjamin West is on the campus. Friends Historical Library[edit] Friends Historical Library was established in 1871 to collect, preserve, and make available archival, manuscript, printed, and visual records concerning the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) from their origins mid-seventeenth century to the present. Besides the focus on Quaker history, the holdings are a significant research collection for the regional and local history of the middle-Atlantic region of the United States and the history of American social reform. Quakers played prominent roles in almost every major reform movement in American history, including abolition, African-American history, Indian rights, women's rights, prison reform, humane treatment of the mentally ill, and temperance. The collections also reflect the significant role Friends played in the development of science, technology, education, and business in Britain and America. The Library also maintains the Swarthmore College Archives and the papers of the Swarthmore Historical Society.[61][62] Within the archives is what was formerly known as the Jane Addams Peace Collection and later called the Swarthmore College Peace Collection (SCPC).[63] The SCPC includes papers from Jane Addams' collection and material from over 59 countries.[64] The Nobel Peace Prize, awarded to Addams, is part of the collection.[64] The SCPC states that ""Well over fifty percent of all the holdings in the Peace Collection concern women's activism around the world.""[65] The SCPC was started when a member of the board of managers discovered that Addams was burning her old papers, and convinced her to donate them instead to the Friends Historical Library.[66] After World War II, the librarian at Princeton University, Julian P. Boyd, appraised the papers in the SCPC's collection and found that they were of ""rare historic value"".[67] Student life[edit] 1647 students (colloquially referred to as ""Swatties"") attend Swarthmore as of 2018[update]. The student life is typically characterized as intensely intellectual and nerdy.[68] The median family income of Swatties is $165,500, with 53% of students coming from the top 10% highest-earning families and 18.2% from the bottom 60%.[69] Mock Trial[edit] Founded in 2000,[70] the Swarthmore Mock Trial team placed 10th at the 2000 American Mock Trial Association (AMTA) National Championship Tournament and was awarded ""Best New School"". Dennis Cheng '01 was awarded the prestigious ""Spirit of AMTA"" award in 2000.[71][72] Swarthmore's team placed 2nd at the 2001 AMTA National Championship Tournament.[72] The Swarthmore Mock Trial program has also won numerous accolades and boasted a team of over 25 members for the 2013–2014 season. The 2010–2011 competitive season resulted in all three teams competing at Regional Championships, two teams going on to Opening Round Championships, and one team qualifying and competing at the 2011 National Championships held in Des Moines, Iowa, where the team placed 15th in their division. Other successes included placing first at the Philadelphia Regional competition in February 2011, and winning the University of Massachusetts Amherst's invitational tournament in February 2014.[73] The Amos J. Peaslee Debate Society[edit] This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (December 2019) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The Amos J. Peaslee Debate Society, named after a former United States Ambassador to Australia, is one of the few independently endowed organizations on campus. Members of the Society debate on the American Parliamentary Debate Association (APDA) circuit in addition to traveling abroad to Britain, Canada, and the World Universities Debating Championship for British Parliamentary Style tournaments. The team has won four APDA national championships, including one as recently as 2017. It has also won Team of the Year two times and Speaker of the Year once. In 2018, it was ranked as the top liberal arts debate program in the country. ΦΣΚ's Phi Chapter, at Swarthmore, circa 1944 Greek life[edit] Until 2019, two Greek organizations existed on the campus in the form of fraternities: Delta Upsilon and local Phi Psi, a former chapter of Phi Kappa Psi. A third, Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity, maintained a chapter on campus from 1906 to 1991 and continues strong alumni involvement.[74][75] Sororities were abandoned in the 1930s following student outrage about discrimination within the sorority system, and leading to a 79-year ban.[76][77] However, in September 2012, the college announced that the ban on sororities would be reversed as of the 2013 term, citing Title IX regulations.[78] The four women who helped overturn the ban subsequently spearheaded the reestablishment of a Kappa Alpha Theta chapter the following spring.[79][80] The announcement sparked controversy on campus; a petition seeking a referendum to continue the ban was dismissed, again citing a legal opinion that to disallow the sorority chapter would be a violation of Title IX regulations. The sorority admitted its first pledge class in the Spring of 2013. A further non-binding referendum was later distributed, but by then the controversy had cooled: Of the six items on the referendum, only one passed, which asked ""Do you support admitting students of all genders to sororities and fraternities?"" No action was taken on the referendum.[81] In April 2019, two student publications, Voices and The Phoenix, published leaked minutes from Swarthmore's chapter of Phi Psi dating from 2013 to 2016. The 116-page document contained a plethora of misogynistic, racist, and homophobic jokes and slurs as well as pornographic images and evidence of hazing.[82][83] Students responded by calling for the college's administration to immediately terminate all fraternity leases on campus, staging a sit-in at the Phi Psi house until the demands were met.[84] Both Delta Upsilon and Phi Psi announced their voluntary disbandment on April 30, 2019.[75] President Valerie Smith subsequently announced on May 10, 2019 that Greek letter organizations were no longer allowed at Swarthmore.[85] Athletics[edit] Swarthmore’s athletic department has a total of 22 varsity intercollegiate sports teams including badminton, baseball, basketball, cross country, field hockey, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track and field and volleyball. The football team was controversially eliminated in 2000,[86] along with wrestling and, initially, badminton. The Board of Managers cited lack of athletes on campus and difficulty of recruiting as reasons for terminating the programs.[87][88][89] The department also offers a number of club sport options, including men's and women's rugby, ultimate frisbee, volleyball, fencing, and squash.[90] In total, 40 percent of Swarthmore students participate in intercollegiate or club sports.[91] Swarthmore is a charter member of the Centennial Conference, a group of private colleges in Pennsylvania and Maryland and is a member of NCAA Division III.[92] The men’s basketball team is currently coached by Landry Kosmalski who was named Division III's National Coach of the Year in 2020.[93] In the 2018–19 season, the Garnet reached the NCAA Division III Championship Game for the first time but lost to the University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh 96–82.[94] The 2019–20 team began the season 26–0 and were the last unbeaten team remaining out of all of Division I, II, and III.[95] The Garnet were ranked No. 1 in the nation by D3hoops.com for the entirety of the season, becoming the first team to be ranked at the top of that poll from start to finish.[96] Swarthmore has won 26 Centennial Conference team championships and claims four national championships in men’s lacrosse in 1900, 1904, 1905 and 1910, four national championships in men’s tennis in 1977, 1981, 1985 and 1990, two men’s tennis doubles national championships in 1976 and 1985, and one individual championship in women’s track and field in 2015.[97][98] Student safety[edit] Based on federal campus safety data for 2014, Swarthmore College was the third highest in the nation in ""total reports of rape per 1,000 students"" on its main campus, with 11 reports of rape per 1,000 students.[99] In 2018 there were six reports of rape, or 3.85 reports per 1,000 students.[100] Media[edit] Swarthmore has two main student news publications, The Swarthmore Phoenix, a weekly newspaper, and Voices, a daily publication, along with several magazines and a radio station, WSRN 91.5 FM. The Swarthmore Phoenix[edit] The Swarthmore Phoenix has been the independent campus newspaper of Swarthmore College since 1881 or 1882.[101][102][103] The phoenix has deep roots in Swarthmore lore. When the College's iconic Parrish Hall was gutted by fire in 1881, it was immediately rebuilt, rising, some noted, from the ashes like the bird found in Egyptian and Greek mythology. Thereafter, The Phoenix became the name of the campus newspaper.[104][105] With an early staff that often numbered fewer than ten people, The Phoenix was first published monthly, then moved to a bi-weekly schedule in 1894. It is now published weekly with a paid staff of more than forty editors, reporters, and columnists. The Phoenix first appeared online in September 1995.[103] The Phoenix, which is published nearly every Thursday, began putting stories online in 1995. Two thousand copies are distributed across the college campus and to the Borough of Swarthmore. The newspaper is printed by Hocking News in Lancaster County.[106] Voices (and The Daily Gazette)[edit] Voices was founded in 2017 as ""an online news publication solely dedicated to centering marginalized voices and creating space for them to tell their own stories"", in response to controversial articles about African-american protests in the already-existing online publication The Daily Gazette.[107] In May 2018, The Daily Gazette, which had been published since 1996, merged with The Phoenix.[108] The birthplace of Benjamin West is on campus. Magazines[edit] There are a number of magazines at Swarthmore, most of which are published semi-annually at the end of each semester. One is Spike, Swarthmore's humor magazine, founded in 1993. The others are literary magazines, including Nacht, which publishes long-form non-fiction, fiction, poetry, and artwork; Small Craft Warnings, which publishes poetry, fiction and artwork; Scarlet Letters, which publishes women's literature; Enie, for Spanish literature; Visibility Zine, for literature and art by historically marginalized groups;[109] OURstory, for literature relating to diversity issues; Bug-Eyed Magazine, a very limited-run science fiction/fantasy magazine published by Psi Phi, formerly known as Swarthmore Warders of Imaginative Literature (SWIL); Remappings (formerly ""CelebrASIAN""), published by the Swarthmore Asian Organization; Alchemy, a collection of academic writings published by the Swarthmore Writing Associates; Mjumbe, published by the Swarthmore African-American Student Society; and a magazine for French literature. An erotica magazine, ! (pronounced ""bang"") was briefly published in 2005 in homage to an earlier publication, Untouchables. Most of the literary magazines print approximately 500 copies, with around 100 pages. There is also a photography magazine, Pun/ctum, which features work from students and alumni.[110] Radio station[edit] WSRN 91.5 FM is the college radio station. It has a mix of indie, rock, hip-hop, electronic dance, folk, world, jazz, and classical music, as well as a number of radio talk shows. At one time, WSRN had a significant news department, and covered events such as the 1969 black protest movement extensively.[111] In the 1990s, WSRN centered its programming on the immensely popular ""Hank and Bernie Show"", starring undergraduates Hank Hanks and Bernie Bernstein. Hank and Bernie conducted wide-ranging and entertaining interviews of sports stars and cultural icons such as Lou Piniella, Mark Grace, Jake Plummer, Greg Ostertag, Andy Karich and Mark ""the Bird"" Fidrych, and also engaged the Swarthmore community in discussions on campus issues and current events. Upwards of 90 percent of the Swarthmore community would tune in to the Hank and Bernie Show and many members of the surrounding villages and towns would also listen and call in. Many archived recordings of musical and spoken word performances exist, such as the once-annual Swarthmore Folk Festival.[112] Today WSRN focuses virtually exclusively on entertainment, though it has covered significant news developments such as the athletic cuts in 2000[113] and the effects of the September 11 attacks on campus. War News Radio and The Sudan Radio Project (formerly the Darfur Radio Project) do broadcast news on WSRN, however. Currently, the longest running show in WSRN's lineup is ""Oído al Tambor"", which focuses on news and music from Latin America. The show has been running non-stop, on Sundays from 4:00 to 6:00 p.m., since September 2006. After its members graduated in December 2009, the show's concept was revived by the show ""Rayuela"", which has been running since September 2009. Another notable show is Deep Sound,[114] hosted by Swarthmore students Arjun Madan and Steven Hergenroeder who mix their top house, deep house, techno, and trance tracks live on set. Swarthmore SEPTA Station at the foot of campus. Societies and Groups[edit] A cappella[edit] The collegiate a cappella groups include Sixteen Feet, the College's oldest group (founded in 1981), as well as its first and only all-male group. Grapevine is its corresponding all-female group (founded in 1983), and Mixed Company is a co-ed group. Essence of Soul is the college's all-black group. The youngest group, OffBeat was founded in the fall of 2013 as a group open to all genders and identities. In addition, Chaverim is a co-ed group that includes students from the Tri-College Consortium and draws on music from cultures around the world for its repertoire. The groups, self-run as volunteer clubs with college support, travel to other schools to participate in concerts. Once every semester, all of the school's a cappella groups collaborate for a joint concert called Jamboree, which includes visiting groups from other colleges and universities.[115] Swarthmore Fire and Protective Association[edit] Swarthmore College students are eligible to participate in the local emergency department, the Swarthmore Fire and Protective Association. They are trained as firefighters and as emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and are qualified on both the state and national level. The fire department responds to over 200 fire calls and almost 800 EMS calls a year.[116] A fire horn is located within the Swarthmore campus and its sound has become a fixture of campus life.[117] Students affectionately refer to the noise as the call of the Fire Moose or the Space Whale, although the names themselves are in a constant state of evolution. Swarthmore College Computer Society[edit] Swarthmore College Computer Society (SCCS) is a student-run volunteer organization independent of the official ITS department of the college.[118] SCCS operates a set of servers that provide web applications for the Swarthmore College community, e-mail accounts, Unix shell login accounts, server storage space, and webspace to students, professors, alumni, and other student-run organizations. SCCS hosts over 100 mailing lists used by various student groups, and over 130 organizational websites. SCCS also provides a computer lab and gaming room, located in Clothier basement beneath Essie Mae's snack bar.[119] Impact[edit] In September 2003, the SCCS servers survived a Slashdotting while hosting a copy of the Diebold memos on behalf of the student group Free Culture Swarthmore, then known as the Swarthmore Coalition for the Digital Commons. SCCS staff promptly complied with the relevant DMCA takedown request received by the college's ITS department.[120] SCCS was noted in PC Magazine's article ""Top 20 Wired Colleges"" as one of the reasons for ranking Swarthmore #4 on that list.[121] During the 2004–2005 school year, the SCCS Media Lounge served as the early home of War News Radio, a weekly webcast run by Swarthmore students and providing news about the Iraq war, providing resources, space, and technical support for the project in its infancy. Three SCCS-related papers have been accepted for publication at the USENIX Large Installation System Administration (LISA) Conference, one of which was awarded Best Paper.[122][123][124][125] Alumni[edit] Main article: List of Swarthmore College people Swarthmore's alumni include five Nobel Prize winners, namely the 2006 Physics laureate John C.

Swarthmore also is affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania through the Quaker Consortium, which allows for students to cross-register for classes at all four institutions.[10] Swarthmore offers over 600 courses per year in more than 40 areas of study, including an ABET-accredited engineering program that culminates in a Bachelor of Science in engineering.[11] Swarthmore has a variety of sporting teams with a total of 22 Division III Intercollegiate sports teams, and it competes in the Centennial Conference, a group of private colleges in Pennsylvania and Maryland.[12] The school's alumni have attained prominence in a broad range of fields. Graduates include five Nobel Prize winners (as of 2016[update], the third-highest number of Nobel Prize winners per graduate in the U.S.),[13] 11 MacArthur Foundation fellows, 30 Rhodes Scholars, 27 Truman Scholars, 10 Marshall Scholars, and 201 Fulbright Grantees.

Alice Paul and David Kemp, two of the newer buildings, won the American Institute of Architects Housing Awards in 2010.[14] The name ""Swarthmore"" has its roots in early Quaker history. In England, Swarthmoor Hall near the town of Ulverston, Cumbria, (previously in Lancashire), was the home of Thomas and Margaret Fell in 1652 when George Fox, (1624–1691), fresh from his epiphany atop Pendle Hill in 1651, came to visit. The visitation turned into a long association, as Fox persuaded Thomas and Margaret Fell of his views. Swarthmore was used for the first meetings of what became known as the Religious Society of Friends (later colloquially labeled ""The Quakers""). The College was founded in 1864 by Deborah Fisher Wharton, along with her industrialist son, Joseph Wharton, together with a committee of members of the Hicksite Yearly Meetings of Philadelphia, New York and Baltimore. It is the only college founded by the Hicksite branch of the Society of Friends: previous Quaker institutions, like nearby Haverford College, were Orthodox in their founding history. Swarthmore held its first classes in 1869[8] and Edward Parrish (1822–1872) was the first president. Lucretia Mott (1793–1880) and Martha Ellicott Tyson (1795–1873)[15][16] were among those Friends who insisted that the new college of Swarthmore be coeducational. Edward Hicks Magill, the second president, served for 17 years.[17] His daughter, Helen Magill, (1853–1944), was in the first class to graduate in 1873; in 1877, she was the first woman in the United States to earn a Doctor of Philosophy degree, (Ph.D.); hers was in Greek from Boston University in Boston, Massachusetts.[18] Around 11 p.m. on September 25, 1881, a fire occurred in Parrish Hall, destroying all but the exterior of the building. Parrish Hall reopened on January 18, 1883.[8] In the early 1900s, the College had a major collegiate American football program during the formation period of the soon-to-be nationwide sport (playing Navy, Princeton, Columbia, and other larger schools) and an active fraternity and sorority life.[19] The 1921 appointment of Frank Aydelotte as president began the development of the school's current academic focus, particularly with his vision for the Honors program based on his experience as a Rhodes Scholar.[20] During World War II, Swarthmore was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program, which offered students a path to a U.S. Navy commission.[21] Wolfgang Köhler, Hans Wallach and Solomon Asch were noted psychologists who became professors at Swarthmore, a center for Gestalt psychology. Both Wallach, who was Jewish, and Köhler, who was not, had left Nazi Germany because of its discriminatory policies against Jews. Köhler came to Swarthmore in 1935 and served until his retirement in 1958. Wallach came in 1936, first as a researcher, and also teaching from 1942 until 1975. Asch, who was Polish-American and had immigrated as a child to the US in 1920, joined the faculty in 1947 and served until 1966, conducting his noted conformity experiments at Swarthmore.[22] The 1960s and 1970s saw the construction of new buildings: Sharples Dining Hall in 1964, Worth Health Center in 1965, the Dana/Hallowell Residence Halls in 1967, and Lang Music Building in 1973.[8] They also saw a 1967 review of the college initiated by President Courtney Smith, a Black protest movement, in which African-American students conducted an eight-day sit-in in the admissions office in 1969 to demand increased Black enrollment, and the establishment of both a Black Cultural Center (1970) and Women's Resource Center (1974).[8][23][24] The Environmental Studies program and the Intercultural Center were established in 1992, and in 1993 the Lang Performing Arts Center was opened; the Kohlberg Hall was then established in 1996 and a renovation of the Trotter hall was undertaken in 1997.[8] In 1999 the college began purchasing renewable energy credits in the form of wind power, and in the 2002–2003 academic year it constructed its first green roof.[8] In 2008, Swarthmore's first mascot, Phineas the Phoenix, made its debut.[8] Academics[edit] Observatory Swarthmore's Oxbridge tutorial-inspired Honors Program allows students to take double-credit seminars from their third year, and they often write honors theses. Seminars are usually composed of four to eight students. Students in seminars will usually write at least three 10-page papers per seminar, and often one of these papers is expanded into a 20–30 page paper by the end of the seminar. At the end of their final year, Honors students take oral and written examinations conducted by outside experts in their field. Usually one student in each discipline is awarded ""Highest Honors""; others are either awarded ""High Honors"" or ""Honors""; rarely, a student is denied Honors altogether by the outside examiner. Each department usually has a grade threshold for admission to the Honors program.[25] Uncommon for a liberal arts college, Swarthmore has an engineering program in which, at the completion of four years' work, students are granted a B.S. in Engineering. Other notable programs include minors in peace and conflict studies, cognitive science, and interpretation theory.[11] Swarthmore has a total undergraduate student enrollment of 1,620 (for the 2016–2017 year) and 187 faculty members (99% with a terminal degree), for a student-faculty ratio of 8:1. The small college offers more than 600 courses per year in over 40 courses of study.[26] Swarthmore has a reputation as a very academically oriented college, with 66% of students participating in undergraduate research or independent creative projects, and 90% of graduates eventually attending graduate or professional school. Rankings[edit] Academic rankings National ARWU[27] 155–175 Forbes[28] 25 THE/WSJ[29] 28 Global ARWU[30] 601–700 Liberal arts colleges U.S. News & World Report[31] 3 Washington Monthly[32] 15 Some sources, including Greene's Guides,[33] have termed Swarthmore one of the ""Little Ivies"". In its 2019 college ranking, U.S. News & World Report ranked Swarthmore as the third-best liberal arts college in the nation, behind Williams and Amherst and tied with Wellesley.[34] Since the inception of the ""U.S. News"" rankings, Amherst, Williams, and Swarthmore are the only colleges to have been ranked for the number one liberal arts college. Swarthmore has been ranked the number one liberal arts college in the country a total of six times.[35] In its 2019 ranking of 650 U.S. colleges, universities and service academies, Forbes magazine ranked Swarthmore twenty-fifth.[36] Swarthmore ranked fourth among all institutions of higher education in the United States as measured by the percentage of graduates who went on to earn Ph.D.s between 2002–2011.[37] In 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2013,[38] Swarthmore was named the #1 ""Best Value"" private college by The Princeton Review.[39] Overall selection criteria included more than 30 factors in three areas: academics, costs and financial aid. Swarthmore was also placed on The Princeton Review's Financial Aid Honor Roll along with twelve other institutions for receiving the highest possible rating in its ranking methodology.[40] Admissions[edit] Admission Statistics 2018[41][42] 2017[43][44] 2016[45] 2015[46] 2014[47] Applicants 10,749 9,383 7,717 7,818 5,540 Admits 1,016 1,004 988 976 943 Admit rate 9.45% 10.7% 12.8% 12.5% 17.0% Enrolled 422 399 415 407 407 SAT range (Critical Reading + Math) N/A 1370–1540 1305–1530 1340–1530 1360–1540 ACT range N/A 31–34 30–34 30–34 29–34 The college is considered by U.S. News & World Report as ""most selective,” with 10.7% accepted of the 9,383 applicants during the 2016–2017 admissions cycle.[44] The number of applicants was the highest in the college's history and among the highest overall of any liberal arts college.[48][49][50][51] The college saw increases in the number of underrepresented students, first generation college students, and international students. The college reports that ""Twenty-five percent of the admitted students are among the first generation in their family to attend college"" and ""Of the admitted students attending high schools reporting class rank, 94 percent are in the top decile"".[43] The 2018 admission statistics are only partially released; it is known so far that 10,749 applicants resulted in 1,016 admits for an admit rate of 9.45%.[41][42] In 2012, The Princeton Review gave Swarthmore a 99 out of 99 on their Admissions Selectivity Rating.[52] Graduates[edit] At Swarthmore, 16% of earners of undergraduate degrees immediately enter graduate or professional school, and, within five years of graduation, 77% of alumni enter these programs. Alumni of the school earn graduate degrees most commonly at institutions that include University of California-Berkeley, University of Michigan, Harvard, Columbia, New York University, University of Pennsylvania, Cambridge University, Oxford University, Johns Hopkins, Stanford, and Yale.[53] At graduate programs, the most common fields for Swarthmore graduates to enter are humanities, math & physical sciences, life sciences, and social sciences.[53] PayScale reports that Swarthmore graduates have an average starting salary of $61,300 and an average mid-career salary of $130,900, making their salaries 39th highest among all colleges and universities, and 10th among liberal arts colleges alone.[54][55] Endowment and tuition fees[edit] The cost of tuition, student activity fees, room, and board for the 2017–2018 academic year was $65,774 (tuition fees alone were $50,424).[26] The college meets 100% of admitted student demonstrated need without use of student loans, an important distinction from the many schools that meet 100% of demonstrated need, but only through loans (which must be repaid) rather than institutional grant- and scholarship-based funding (which does not require repayment). In total, 56% of the student body receives financial aid, and the average financial aid award was $50,361 during the 2017–18 year.[7] As a need-blind school, Swarthmore makes admission decisions and financial aid decisions independently. Operating revenue for the 2016 fiscal year was $148,086,000, over 50% of which was provided by the endowment.[7] Swarthmore ended a $230 million capital campaign on October 6, 2006, when President Bloom declared the project completed, three months ahead of schedule. The campaign, christened the ""Meaning of Swarthmore"", had been underway officially since the fall of 2001. 87% of the college's alumni participated in the effort. Swarthmore's endowment at the end of the 2019 fiscal year was $2.13 billion. Endowment per student was $1,370,157 for the same year, one of the highest rates in the country.[3] At the end of 2007, the Swarthmore Board of Managers approved the decision for the college to eliminate student loans from all financial aid packages. Instead, additional aid scholarships are granted.[56] Campus[edit] Parrish Hall from Magill Walk The campus consists of 425 acres (1.72 km2), based on a north-south axis anchored by Parrish Hall, which houses numerous administrative offices and student lounges, as well as two floors of student housing. The fourth floor houses campus radio station WSRN-FM as well as the weekly student newspaper, The Phoenix. Many acres are wooded and include trails. From the SEPTA Swarthmore commuter train station and the ""ville"" or borough of Swarthmore to the south, the oak-lined Magill Walk leads north up a hill to Parrish. The campus is coterminous with the grounds of the Scott Arboretum, cited by some as a main staple of the campus's renowned beauty.[57] In 2011, Travel+Leisure named Swarthmore one of the most beautiful college campuses in the United States.[58] The majority of the buildings housing classrooms and department offices are located to the north of Parrish, as are Kyle and Woolman dormitories. McCabe Library is to the east of Parrish, as are the dorms Willets, Mertz, Worth, The Lodges, Alice Paul, and David Kemp. To the west are the dorms Wharton, Dana, Hallowell, and Danawell, along with the Scott Amphitheater, an open wooded outdoor amphitheater, in which graduations and college collections (meetings) are held. The Crum Woods extend westward from the main campus, and many buildings on the forest side of the campus incorporate views of the woods. South of Parrish are Sharples dining hall and other smaller buildings. Palmer, Pittenger, and Roberts dormitories are south of the railroad station, as are the athletic facilities, while the Mary Lyon dorm is off-campus to the southwest.[59] The College has three main libraries (McCabe Library, the Cornell Library of Science and Engineering, and the Underhill Music and Dance Library) and seven other specialized collections.[60] Since 1923, McCabe library has been a Federal Depository library for selected U.S. Government documents. The birthplace of American artist Benjamin West is on the campus. Friends Historical Library[edit] Friends Historical Library was established in 1871 to collect, preserve, and make available archival, manuscript, printed, and visual records concerning the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) from their origins mid-seventeenth century to the present. Besides the focus on Quaker history, the holdings are a significant research collection for the regional and local history of the middle-Atlantic region of the United States and the history of American social reform. Quakers played prominent roles in almost every major reform movement in American history, including abolition, African-American history, Indian rights, women's rights, prison reform, humane treatment of the mentally ill, and temperance. The collections also reflect the significant role Friends played in the development of science, technology, education, and business in Britain and America. The Library also maintains the Swarthmore College Archives and the papers of the Swarthmore Historical Society.[61][62] Within the archives is what was formerly known as the Jane Addams Peace Collection and later called the Swarthmore College Peace Collection (SCPC).[63] The SCPC includes papers from Jane Addams' collection and material from over 59 countries.[64] The Nobel Peace Prize, awarded to Addams, is part of the collection.[64] The SCPC states that ""Well over fifty percent of all the holdings in the Peace Collection concern women's activism around the world.""[65] The SCPC was started when a member of the board of managers discovered that Addams was burning her old papers, and convinced her to donate them instead to the Friends Historical Library.[66] After World War II, the librarian at Princeton University, Julian P. Boyd, appraised the papers in the SCPC's collection and found that they were of ""rare historic value"".[67] Student life[edit] 1647 students (colloquially referred to as ""Swatties"") attend Swarthmore as of 2018[update]. The student life is typically characterized as intensely intellectual and nerdy.[68] The median family income of Swatties is $165,500, with 53% of students coming from the top 10% highest-earning families and 18.2% from the bottom 60%.[69] Mock Trial[edit] Founded in 2000,[70] the Swarthmore Mock Trial team placed 10th at the 2000 American Mock Trial Association (AMTA) National Championship Tournament and was awarded ""Best New School"". Dennis Cheng '01 was awarded the prestigious ""Spirit of AMTA"" award in 2000.[71][72] Swarthmore's team placed 2nd at the 2001 AMTA National Championship Tournament.[72] The Swarthmore Mock Trial program has also won numerous accolades and boasted a team of over 25 members for the 2013–2014 season. The 2010–2011 competitive season resulted in all three teams competing at Regional Championships, two teams going on to Opening Round Championships, and one team qualifying and competing at the 2011 National Championships held in Des Moines, Iowa, where the team placed 15th in their division. Other successes included placing first at the Philadelphia Regional competition in February 2011, and winning the University of Massachusetts Amherst's invitational tournament in February 2014.[73] The Amos J. Peaslee Debate Society[edit] This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (December 2019) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The Amos J. Peaslee Debate Society, named after a former United States Ambassador to Australia, is one of the few independently endowed organizations on campus. Members of the Society debate on the American Parliamentary Debate Association (APDA) circuit in addition to traveling abroad to Britain, Canada, and the World Universities Debating Championship for British Parliamentary Style tournaments. The team has won four APDA national championships, including one as recently as 2017. It has also won Team of the Year two times and Speaker of the Year once. In 2018, it was ranked as the top liberal arts debate program in the country. ΦΣΚ's Phi Chapter, at Swarthmore, circa 1944 Greek life[edit] Until 2019, two Greek organizations existed on the campus in the form of fraternities: Delta Upsilon and local Phi Psi, a former chapter of Phi Kappa Psi. A third, Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity, maintained a chapter on campus from 1906 to 1991 and continues strong alumni involvement.[74][75] Sororities were abandoned in the 1930s following student outrage about discrimination within the sorority system, and leading to a 79-year ban.[76][77] However, in September 2012, the college announced that the ban on sororities would be reversed as of the 2013 term, citing Title IX regulations.[78] The four women who helped overturn the ban subsequently spearheaded the reestablishment of a Kappa Alpha Theta chapter the following spring.[79][80] The announcement sparked controversy on campus; a petition seeking a referendum to continue the ban was dismissed, again citing a legal opinion that to disallow the sorority chapter would be a violation of Title IX regulations. The sorority admitted its first pledge class in the Spring of 2013. A further non-binding referendum was later distributed, but by then the controversy had cooled: Of the six items on the referendum, only one passed, which asked ""Do you support admitting students of all genders to sororities and fraternities?"" No action was taken on the referendum.[81] In April 2019, two student publications, Voices and The Phoenix, published leaked minutes from Swarthmore's chapter of Phi Psi dating from 2013 to 2016. The 116-page document contained a plethora of misogynistic, racist, and homophobic jokes and slurs as well as pornographic images and evidence of hazing.[82][83] Students responded by calling for the college's administration to immediately terminate all fraternity leases on campus, staging a sit-in at the Phi Psi house until the demands were met.[84] Both Delta Upsilon and Phi Psi announced their voluntary disbandment on April 30, 2019.[75] President Valerie Smith subsequently announced on May 10, 2019 that Greek letter organizations were no longer allowed at Swarthmore.[85] Athletics[edit] Swarthmore’s athletic department has a total of 22 varsity intercollegiate sports teams including badminton, baseball, basketball, cross country, field hockey, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track and field and volleyball. The football team was controversially eliminated in 2000,[86] along with wrestling and, initially, badminton. The Board of Managers cited lack of athletes on campus and difficulty of recruiting as reasons for terminating the programs.[87][88][89] The department also offers a number of club sport options, including men's and women's rugby, ultimate frisbee, volleyball, fencing, and squash.[90] In total, 40 percent of Swarthmore students participate in intercollegiate or club sports.[91] Swarthmore is a charter member of the Centennial Conference, a group of private colleges in Pennsylvania and Maryland and is a member of NCAA Division III.[92] The men’s basketball team is currently coached by Landry Kosmalski who was named Division III's National Coach of the Year in 2020.[93] In the 2018–19 season, the Garnet reached the NCAA Division III Championship Game for the first time but lost to the University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh 96–82.[94] The 2019–20 team began the season 26–0 and were the last unbeaten team remaining out of all of Division I, II, and III.[95] The Garnet were ranked No. 1 in the nation by D3hoops.com for the entirety of the season, becoming the first team to be ranked at the top of that poll from start to finish.[96] Swarthmore has won 26 Centennial Conference team championships and claims four national championships in men’s lacrosse in 1900, 1904, 1905 and 1910, four national championships in men’s tennis in 1977, 1981, 1985 and 1990, two men’s tennis doubles national championships in 1976 and 1985, and one individual championship in women’s track and field in 2015.[97][98] Student safety[edit] Based on federal campus safety data for 2014, Swarthmore College was the third highest in the nation in ""total reports of rape per 1,000 students"" on its main campus, with 11 reports of rape per 1,000 students.[99] In 2018 there were six reports of rape, or 3.85 reports per 1,000 students.[100] Media[edit] Swarthmore has two main student news publications, The Swarthmore Phoenix, a weekly newspaper, and Voices, a daily publication, along with several magazines and a radio station, WSRN 91.5 FM. The Swarthmore Phoenix[edit] The Swarthmore Phoenix has been the independent campus newspaper of Swarthmore College since 1881 or 1882.[101][102][103] The phoenix has deep roots in Swarthmore lore. When the College's iconic Parrish Hall was gutted by fire in 1881, it was immediately rebuilt, rising, some noted, from the ashes like the bird found in Egyptian and Greek mythology. Thereafter, The Phoenix became the name of the campus newspaper.[104][105] With an early staff that often numbered fewer than ten people, The Phoenix was first published monthly, then moved to a bi-weekly schedule in 1894. It is now published weekly with a paid staff of more than forty editors, reporters, and columnists. The Phoenix first appeared online in September 1995.[103] The Phoenix, which is published nearly every Thursday, began putting stories online in 1995. Two thousand copies are distributed across the college campus and to the Borough of Swarthmore. The newspaper is printed by Hocking News in Lancaster County.[106] Voices (and The Daily Gazette)[edit] Voices was founded in 2017 as ""an online news publication solely dedicated to centering marginalized voices and creating space for them to tell their own stories"", in response to controversial articles about African-american protests in the already-existing online publication The Daily Gazette.[107] In May 2018, The Daily Gazette, which had been published since 1996, merged with The Phoenix.[108] The birthplace of Benjamin West is on campus. Magazines[edit] There are a number of magazines at Swarthmore, most of which are published semi-annually at the end of each semester. One is Spike, Swarthmore's humor magazine, founded in 1993. The others are literary magazines, including Nacht, which publishes long-form non-fiction, fiction, poetry, and artwork; Small Craft Warnings, which publishes poetry, fiction and artwork; Scarlet Letters, which publishes women's literature; Enie, for Spanish literature; Visibility Zine, for literature and art by historically marginalized groups;[109] OURstory, for literature relating to diversity issues; Bug-Eyed Magazine, a very limited-run science fiction/fantasy magazine published by Psi Phi, formerly known as Swarthmore Warders of Imaginative Literature (SWIL); Remappings (formerly ""CelebrASIAN""), published by the Swarthmore Asian Organization; Alchemy, a collection of academic writings published by the Swarthmore Writing Associates; Mjumbe, published by the Swarthmore African-American Student Society; and a magazine for French literature. An erotica magazine, ! (pronounced ""bang"") was briefly published in 2005 in homage to an earlier publication, Untouchables. Most of the literary magazines print approximately 500 copies, with around 100 pages. There is also a photography magazine, Pun/ctum, which features work from students and alumni.[110] Radio station[edit] WSRN 91.5 FM is the college radio station. It has a mix of indie, rock, hip-hop, electronic dance, folk, world, jazz, and classical music, as well as a number of radio talk shows. At one time, WSRN had a significant news department, and covered events such as the 1969 black protest movement extensively.[111] In the 1990s, WSRN centered its programming on the immensely popular ""Hank and Bernie Show"", starring undergraduates Hank Hanks and Bernie Bernstein. Hank and Bernie conducted wide-ranging and entertaining interviews of sports stars and cultural icons such as Lou Piniella, Mark Grace, Jake Plummer, Greg Ostertag, Andy Karich and Mark ""the Bird"" Fidrych, and also engaged the Swarthmore community in discussions on campus issues and current events. Upwards of 90 percent of the Swarthmore community would tune in to the Hank and Bernie Show and many members of the surrounding villages and towns would also listen and call in. Many archived recordings of musical and spoken word performances exist, such as the once-annual Swarthmore Folk Festival.[112] Today WSRN focuses virtually exclusively on entertainment, though it has covered significant news developments such as the athletic cuts in 2000[113] and the effects of the September 11 attacks on campus. War News Radio and The Sudan Radio Project (formerly the Darfur Radio Project) do broadcast news on WSRN, however. Currently, the longest running show in WSRN's lineup is ""Oído al Tambor"", which focuses on news and music from Latin America. The show has been running non-stop, on Sundays from 4:00 to 6:00 p.m., since September 2006. After its members graduated in December 2009, the show's concept was revived by the show ""Rayuela"", which has been running since September 2009. Another notable show is Deep Sound,[114] hosted by Swarthmore students Arjun Madan and Steven Hergenroeder who mix their top house, deep house, techno, and trance tracks live on set. Swarthmore SEPTA Station at the foot of campus. Societies and Groups[edit] A cappella[edit] The collegiate a cappella groups include Sixteen Feet, the College's oldest group (founded in 1981), as well as its first and only all-male group. Grapevine is its corresponding all-female group (founded in 1983), and Mixed Company is a co-ed group. Essence of Soul is the college's all-black group. The youngest group, OffBeat was founded in the fall of 2013 as a group open to all genders and identities. In addition, Chaverim is a co-ed group that includes students from the Tri-College Consortium and draws on music from cultures around the world for its repertoire. The groups, self-run as volunteer clubs with college support, travel to other schools to participate in concerts. Once every semester, all of the school's a cappella groups collaborate for a joint concert called Jamboree, which includes visiting groups from other colleges and universities.[115] Swarthmore Fire and Protective Association[edit] Swarthmore College students are eligible to participate in the local emergency department, the Swarthmore Fire and Protective Association. They are trained as firefighters and as emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and are qualified on both the state and national level. The fire department responds to over 200 fire calls and almost 800 EMS calls a year.[116] A fire horn is located within the Swarthmore campus and its sound has become a fixture of campus life.[117] Students affectionately refer to the noise as the call of the Fire Moose or the Space Whale, although the names themselves are in a constant state of evolution. Swarthmore College Computer Society[edit] Swarthmore College Computer Society (SCCS) is a student-run volunteer organization independent of the official ITS department of the college.[118] SCCS operates a set of servers that provide web applications for the Swarthmore College community, e-mail accounts, Unix shell login accounts, server storage space, and webspace to students, professors, alumni, and other student-run organizations. SCCS hosts over 100 mailing lists used by various student groups, and over 130 organizational websites. SCCS also provides a computer lab and gaming room, located in Clothier basement beneath Essie Mae's snack bar.[119] Impact[edit] In September 2003, the SCCS servers survived a Slashdotting while hosting a copy of the Diebold memos on behalf of the student group Free Culture Swarthmore, then known as the Swarthmore Coalition for the Digital Commons. SCCS staff promptly complied with the relevant DMCA takedown request received by the college's ITS department.[120] SCCS was noted in PC Magazine's article ""Top 20 Wired Colleges"" as one of the reasons for ranking Swarthmore #4 on that list.[121] During the 2004–2005 school year, the SCCS Media Lounge served as the early home of War News Radio, a weekly webcast run by Swarthmore students and providing news about the Iraq war, providing resources, space, and technical support for the project in its infancy. Three SCCS-related papers have been accepted for publication at the USENIX Large Installation System Administration (LISA) Conference, one of which was awarded Best Paper.[122][123][124][125] Alumni[edit] Main article: List of Swarthmore College people Swarthmore's alumni include five Nobel Prize winners, namely the 2006 Physics laureate John C.

See also: Top 100 Most Affordable Universities Top 100 Most Affordable Colleges Top 100 Highest Acceptance Top 100 Lowest Acceptance Top Colleges by Major Ranking Methodology At the end of the day, going to college and earning a degree isn't about prestige, diversity, scholarly publications, social mobility or even reputation–it's about ROI. It's about what students are going to receive from their college experience and education based on what they're required to invest. That's right, invest. College is an investment in the future. Our top colleges rankings include those ""traditional"" four-year colleges and universities that provide students the biggest return on their investment. Where other popular ranking publications focus on various selectivity metrics such as SAT scores, admission rates, or even ""contribution to the public good"" (ie., Washington Monthly, Princeton Review, etc.), we focus strictly on those metrics that have a direct correlation with ROI. Our Top 100 Colleges rankings report is generated using the following five metrics: Post-Graduate Success (35%) Student Satisfaction (25%) Student Debt (25%) Graduation Rate (10%) Academic Success (5%) Post-Graduate Success Whatever your motivation for attending college, if you can't find a good job after you graduate or aren't able to advance in your chosen career path, then your investment of time, money and resources in your college education is greatly depreciated. We believe that first and foremost the value of a college education should be evaluated based on the post-graduate career success of the students and the alumni it produces. As such, our rankings are weighted heavily on metrics we've believe to be the most accurate indicators of post-graduate success. The metrics we evaluate in calculating post-graduate success include: (1) Early and mid-career salary, (2) Net price of a 4-year undergraduate education and (3) whether or not an institution appears on the America's Leaders List produced by the Center for College Affordability and Productivity. Early and mid-career salary figures used in our calculations are based on surveys produced by payscale.com&#8211a leader in employment, salary and compensation data. The ""Early Career Salary"" reflects the average salary for school alumni for years 1-5 following graduation from college. The ""Mid Career Salary"" reflects the average salary for school alumni with 10+ years of full-time work experience following graduation from college. Both figures are used in our calculation of ROI and overall college rankings. For sake of space, only mid-career salary figures are displayed in the rankings above. Cost of education is an essential element of our college ranking calculation with respect to post-graduate success. Without cost, an absolute measure of ROI, or relative value, cannot be ascertained. The cost figure we use to calculate ROI, and determine relative value, is based on the ""Net Price"" of college attendance reported by each individual school in surveys published by the National Center for Education Statistics. Net price, as defined by the National Center for Education Statistics, is the total cost of attendance minus the average amount of financial aid, where total cost includes the cost of tuition, books and supplies, average room and board costs, fees and other expenses, and financial aid includes federal, state and local government grants, and scholarship aid. We calculate 4-year Net Price by multiplying the annual ""Net Price"" figure reported by the National Center for Education Statistics by 4–the average time required to graduate from a ""traditional"" undergraduate college program. A few highly publicized college ranking reports rely heavily on the America's Leaders List in their calculation college rankings with respect to post-graduate success. While we also rely on the America's Leaders List in our calculation of college rankings, we place much less weight on this list than other publications such as Forbes. We feel that relying too heavily on this list, as a determination of post-graduate success, biases rankings in favor of colleges that have produced a few exemplary students. We do not believe this list accurately reflects the post-graduate success of an entire student body at any one institution. Student Satisfaction Student satisfaction is measured as a function of three variables: (1) Student ""happiness"" as reported by Ratemyprofessor.com (based on student surveys), (2) actual freshman-to-sophomore student retention rates and (3) predicted freshman-to-sophomore retention rates, as reported by the National Center for Education Statistics. The student ""happiness"" score published by Ratemyprofessor.com offers a rough indication of how much students enjoy their education experience at a specific institution. It does not however, in our opinion, reflect the sentiment of most students, as survey size and scope is limited. For this reason, it is not weighted heavily in our calculation of student satisfaction. We feel that together, actual and predicted freshman-to-sophomore retention rates are a much better indication of how satisfied students are with the quality of education they're receiving. That is, students attending schools with high levels of student retention are more satisfied with their education than students attending schools with lower levels of student retention. Student retention is assigned more weight in our calculation of overall student satisfaction. Student Debt As of 2019, around 70% of college students graduated with student debt. In 2018, seniors graduated from college with an average student debt of $29,200 – a 26% increase from 2008. This trend has been particularly troublesome among students graduating from for-profit colleges, where the average debt was $39,900 in 2019, a 26% increase from 2008. Student debt is becoming a problem of catastrophic proportion and it is a key component in our calculation of college rankings. In our calculation of college rankings we evaluate two aspects of student debt: (1) default rates and (2) debt load. Together, these metrics (1) indicate the relative affordability of attending an institution and (2) the ability of graduates to pay off their student debt after graduation. The inability to qualify for jobs and salaries required to pay back student debt, is one indicator that students paid a price higher than the value of the education they received. If nothing more, when comparing one college to another, these metrics offer a very good indicator of relative value. Graduation Rate While not weighted as heavily as other ranking metrics, graduation rate is still an important component of our college ranking calculations. A low graduation rate can be a reflection of many things: lacking educational offering, low level of student support, an unclear communication of expectations, or simply the college overselling its offering to new students. However, graduation rates may also simply be a reflection of varying educational offerings and programs – which vary from school to school. The graduation rates we use in our calculations are provided by the National Center for Education Statistics. They reflect those students who (1) began college as full-time students seeking either a degree or certificate and (2) finished their program within 150% of the ""normal time"" required for completion of that program on a national basis – in most cases four years. One of the pitfalls of using graduation rate as a factor in generating college rankings is that it's difficult to determine what a ""normal time"" is for completing a degree. For example, it may take only four-years to complete a full-time undergraduate bachelor's degree at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) where the focus is purely academic, but because students at Northeastern are required to spend time on ""co-ops"" or extracurricular learning activities, it takes them substantially longer to complete a similar ""four year"" bachelor degree. This doesn't mean that the educational offering at UCLA is substantially better than that provided at Northeastern. In this case, the difference in graduation rate is simply a reflection of two different educational programs. The same holds true for another college, Brigham Young University (BYU). In terms of ROI and other post-graduation metrics, BYU is an exceptional school. However, if you were to base their ranking heavily on the accepted definition of graduation rate (which some ranking reports do), they'd be at the bottom of the pack. Almost all male students at BYU leave to serve a 2-year religious mission after their freshman year. So does BYU have a lower calibur educational offering? Well, they have the No.1 ranked accounting program in the United. They also have one of the best finance programs in the nation and due to their international missionary program they offer one of the best foreign language programs in the world. In a uniformly perfect world, graduation rate would be a better metric for assessing relative value, but higher education doesn't operate in a uniformly perfect world. Academic Success It would seem like academic success should be an important metric when it comes to calculating a college's relative rank – and it is. But the fact is, academic success, when compared to other metrics, really isn't the best measure of value, if ROI is at the core of your ranking methodology. The grades a student earned, and awards received, will mean little a few years after graduation when college is a thing of the past. Our academic success metric rewards schools who have a relatively high number of students – compared with other schools – who (1) win prestigious awards and/or (2) go on to earn a graduate (Phd) or professional degree (JD, MBA, PsyD, etc.) after completing their undergraduate education. Calculating ROI As part of our Top 100 Colleges in America rankings we calculate and present an estimated Annualized Return on Investment (ARI) over a 20-year period for each college using the following commonly accepted ARI formula: ARI=(gain+principal/principal)^(1/years)-1 Principal - reflects the Net Price of college attendance, as previously defined and reported by the National Center for Education Statistics, multiplied by 4–the average number of years required to complete an undergraduate degree Gain - calculated by taking the sum of the early career salaries (years 1-5), estimated salaries for years 6-10, and mid career salaries (years 11-20) and adding them to the principal, then subtracting the 20 year estimated annual earnings for those with a high school diploma* minus the 4 years of lost earnings for the time required to complete a college degree. Annual salary for workers with only a high school diploma are based on a weekly earnings figure of $688–as reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Years - 20 years Estimated salaries years 6-10 - based on 1.5 times annual ""Early career"" salary as reported for school alumni on payscale.com While the ARI figure we present may not be 100% accurate in absolute terms, it provides a very accurate measure of relative ROI and value when comparing one institution to another.

Students educated in racially and ethnically diverse settings perform better academically and reap greater professional success than peers from more homogeneous learning environments. The advantage of a multicultural education extends far beyond the classroom and professional life. The idea of democracy is truly dependent on the next generation of leaders, leaders who are prepared to engage with individuals and groups that make up the Melting Pot we call America. Only those who can rejoice in the beauty of our differences while valuing human life will change the world. Our list was based on the following criteria: No race can have more than 45% representationAt least three races are represented by over 12%Percentage of total minorities graduated 2012-13Scholarships, clubs, organizations, and associations available for ethnic groups *Statistics and definitions of race/ethnicity were gathered from the National Center for Education Statistics and Diverse Issues in Higher Education. 50. University of Washington – Tacoma Part of the University of Washington network, UW Tacoma is located in the historic Union Station District with beautiful old brick buildings. UW Tacoma is much smaller than UW Seattle, with 4,500 students, of which more than 80 percent of students transfer from community colleges or other universities. Commitment to diversity at all levels is evident at UW Tacoma. The Office for Equity and Diversity was created to help cultivate differences, and the Diversity Task Force “serves to bring to life the campus’ expression of its value of diversity, and to provide campus guidance for equity, diversity, and multicultural teaching and learning.” The Diversity Resource Center also aides in enhancing campus education, developing community partnerships, and building diversity. Student life includes an MLK Day Unity Breakfast or attending events such as the upcoming 2015 Diversity Summit, titled“Oppression: Know More.” 49. Western New Mexico University Founded in 1893, Western New Mexico University (WNMU) has grown to serve about 3,700 total students. Located in Silver City, New Mexico, WNMU is surrounded by much natural beauty, including the Gala National Forrest. There are over 18 countries represented on campus, and 44 percent of undergraduates are Hispanic. WNMU is designated as a Hispanic Serving Institution. There are multiple cultural clubs to choose from and students participate in Black History Month, Cinco de Mayo, Chinese New Year, and other multicultural celebrations. AT WNMU, there is a strong effort on serving local needs, for example, the Gardner Learning Center “offers affordable access to education with anappreciation for the multicultural, multilingual nature of our population.” 48. Houston Baptist University Houston Baptist University is a private Baptist institution founded in 1960. It is located in Greater Sharpstown in Houston, Texas. It was formed by the Baptist General Convention of Texas on November 15, 1960, culminating from many years of work and study. The aim of the College founder was Celebration of life as well as the quality of learning. Within the campus community, there is a great diversity amongst the students, with 13 percent Asian, 20 percent Black or African-American, 26 percent Hispanic/Latino, and 26 percent White. Students are supported by a variety of cultural organizations including the African Student Association, Filipino Student Organization, International Student Organization, Hispanic Student Organization, and Vietnamese Student Association. 47. Pacific Union College Diversity is part of the essence of Pacific Union College in California. The college is a Seventh-Day Adventist school in the liberal arts tradition and was founded in 1882. Their most popular programs are nursing, biology, business administration, communication and visual arts. Amongst the student body, 17.7 percent are Asian, 27.7 percent White, and 27.1 percent Hispanic/Latino. The campus is alive with many multi-cultural flavors. There are 30 cultural, academic and special interest clubs for the nearly 1700 undergraduates at the Pacific Union. Specifically, there are six cultural clubs or unions for Asian, Black, Filipino, Latino, and Korean students. Interestingly, Pacific Union sends over 1300 student missionaries to places all around the world, adding to the ethnic and global feel of the college.

The first written mention of Alnarp is from 1325. In 1674 it became the official residence of the governor-general of Scania.[2] In 1862, the existing Alnarp Castle was built to house a new school of agronomy, now part of the Alnarp campus of the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences. Alnarp also housed the headquarters of the NordGen.[3] The park at Alnarp Castle is famous for its great diversity of tree species. The campus area also consist of Alnarp Rehabilitation Garden, where the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences conducts R&D as well as education in horticultural therapy, environmental psychology and landscape architecture, regarding connections between people's stay in nature and garden environments and their health and well-being.

Sweden (Swedish: Sverige [ˈsvæ̌rjɛ] (listen)), officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: Konungariket Sverige [ˈkôːnɵŋaˌriːkɛt ˈsvæ̌rjɛ] (listen)), is a Nordic country in Northern Europe.[20] It borders Norway to the west and north, Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund Strait. At 450,295 square kilometres (173,860 sq mi), Sweden is the largest country in Northern Europe, the third-largest country in the European Union, and the fifth largest country in Europe. The capital and largest city is Stockholm. Sweden has a total population of 10.4 million;[12] and a low population density of 25 inhabitants per square kilometre (65/sq mi). 87% of Swedes live in urban areas, which cover 1.5% of the entire land area. The highest concentration is in the central and southern half of the country. Sweden is part of the geographical area of Fennoscandia. The climate is in general mild for its northerly latitude due to significant maritime influence. In spite of the high latitude, Sweden often has warm continental summers, being located in between the North Atlantic, the Baltic Sea, and vast Russia. The general climate and environment vary significantly from the south and north due to the vast latitudal difference, and much of Sweden has reliably cold and snowy winters. Southern Sweden is predominantly agricultural, while the north is heavily forested and includes a portion of the Scandinavian Mountains. Germanic peoples have inhabited Sweden since prehistoric times, emerging into history as the Geats (Swedish: Götar) and Swedes (Svear) and constituting the sea peoples known as the Norsemen. An independent Swedish state emerged during the early 12th century. After the Black Death in the middle of the 14th century killed about a third of the Scandinavian population,[21][22] the dominance of the Hanseatic League in Northern Europe threatened Scandinavia economically and politically. This led to the forming of the Scandinavian Kalmar Union in 1397,[23] which Sweden left in 1523. When Sweden became involved in the Thirty Years' War on the Protestant side, an expansion of its territories began and eventually the Swedish Empire was formed. This became one of the great powers of Europe until the early 18th century. Swedish territories outside the Scandinavian Peninsula were gradually lost during the 18th and 19th centuries, ending with the annexation of present-day Finland by Russia in 1809. The last war in which Sweden was directly involved was in 1814 when Norway was militarily forced into a personal union, which peacefully dissolved in 1905. Since then, Sweden has been at peace, maintaining an official policy of neutrality in foreign affairs.[24] In 2014, Sweden celebrated 200 years of peace, breaking even Switzerland's record for peace.[25] Sweden was formally neutral through both world wars and the Cold War, albeit Sweden has since 2009 openly moved towards cooperation with NATO. Sweden is a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary democracy, with legislative power vested in the 349-member unicameral Riksdag. It is a unitary state, currently divided into 21 counties and 290 municipalities. Sweden maintains a Nordic social welfare system that provides universal health care and tertiary education for its citizens. It has the world's eleventh-highest per capita income and ranks very highly in quality of life, health, education, protection of civil liberties, economic competitiveness, income equality, gender equality, prosperity and human development.[26][27][28] Sweden joined the European Union on 1 January 1995, but has rejected NATO membership, as well as Eurozone membership following a referendum. It is also a member of the United Nations, the Nordic Council, the Council of Europe, the World Trade Organization and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

As early as 1287, references are found in Middle Dutch referring to a lande van sweden (""land of (the) Swedes""), with swede as the singular form.[29] In Old English the country was named Swéoland and Swíoríce (Old Norse Svíaríki). Anglo-Norman of the 12th and 13th centuries used Suane, Swane (with the adjective as Suaneis). In Scots Swane, Swaine, appears in the 16th century. Early Modern English used Swedeland.[30] The Swedish name Sverige (a compound of the words Svea and rike, with lenition of the consonant [k], first recorded in the cognate Swēorice in Beowulf)[31] literally means ""realm of the Swedes"", excluding the Geats in Götaland. Variations of the name Sweden are used in most languages, with the exception of Danish and Norwegian using Sverige, Faroese Svøríki, Icelandic Svíþjóð, and the more notable exception of some Finnic languages where Ruotsi (Finnish) and Rootsi (Estonian) are used, names commonly considered as referring to the people from the coastal areas of Roslagen, Uppland, who were known as the Rus', and through them etymologically related to the English name for Russia.[citation needed] The etymology of Swedes, and thus Sweden, is generally agreed to derive from a root *s(w)e, meaning ""one's own"",[32][33][34] referring to one's own Germanic tribe. History Main article: History of Sweden Prehistory Main article: Prehistoric Sweden A Vendel-era helmet, at the Swedish Museum of National Antiquities Sweden's prehistory begins in the Allerød oscillation, a warm period around 12,000 BC,[35] with Late Palaeolithic reindeer-hunting camps of the Bromme culture at the edge of the ice in what is now the country's southernmost province, Scania. This period was characterized by small bands of hunter-gatherer-fishers using flint technology.[36] Sweden is first described in a written source in Germania by Tacitus in 98 AD.[37] In Germania 44 and 45 he mentions the Swedes (Suiones) as a powerful tribe (distinguished not merely for their arms and men, but for their powerful fleets) with ships that had a prow at each end (longships).[38] Which kings (kuningaz) ruled these Suiones is unknown, but Norse mythology presents a long line of legendary and semi-legendary kings going back to the last centuries BC. As for literacy in Sweden itself, the runic script was in use among the south Scandinavian elite by at least the 2nd century AD, but all that has come down to the present from the Roman Period is curt inscriptions on artefacts, mainly of male names, demonstrating that the people of south Scandinavia spoke Proto-Norse at the time, a language ancestral to Swedish and other North Germanic languages.[39] In the 6th century, Jordanes names two tribes living in Scandza, both of which are now considered to be synonymous with the Swedes: the Suetidi and Suehans. Suetidi is considered to be the Latin form of Svíþjóð, the Old Norse name for the Swedes. Jordanes describes the Suetidi and Dani as being of the same stock and the tallest of people. He later mentions other Scandinavian tribes as being of a same stature.[40] The Suehans were known to the Roman world as suppliers of black fox skins and, according to Jordanes, had very fine horses, similar to those of the Thyringi of Germania (alia vero gens ibi moratur Suehans, quae velud Thyringi equis utuntur eximiis). The Icelandic historian Snorri Sturluson also wrote that the Swedish king Adils (Eadgils) had the finest horses of his day.[citation needed] The Vikings See also: Early Swedish history, Foundation of Modern Sweden, and Varangians Viking expeditions (blue lines) The Swedish Viking Age lasted roughly from the 8th century to the 11th century. It is believed that Swedish Vikings and Gutar mainly travelled east and south, going to Finland, Estonia, the Baltic countries, Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, the Black Sea and even as far as Baghdad. Their routes passed through the Dnieper south to Constantinople, on which they carried out numerous raids. The Byzantine Emperor Theophilos noticed their great skills in war, and invited them to serve as his personal bodyguard, known as the Varangian Guard. The Swedish Vikings, called Rus are believed to be the founding fathers of Kievan Rus'.[41] The Arab traveller Ibn Fadlan described these Vikings as follows: I have seen the Rus as they came on their merchant journeys and encamped by the Itil. I have never seen more perfect physical specimens, tall as date palms, blond and ruddy; they wear neither tunics nor caftans, but the men wear a garment which covers one side of the body and leaves a hand free. Each man has an axe, a sword, and a knife, and keeps each by him at all times. The swords are broad and grooved, of Frankish sort.[42] The Tjängvide image stone dating from 800 to 1099, example of Viking art The actions of these Swedish Vikings are commemorated on many runestones in Sweden, such as the Greece runestones and the Varangian runestones. There was also considerable participation in expeditions westwards, which are commemorated on stones such as the England runestones. The last major Swedish Viking expedition appears to have been the ill-fated expedition of Ingvar the Far-Travelled to Serkland, the region south-east of the Caspian Sea. Its members are commemorated on the Ingvar runestones, none of which mentions any survivor. What happened to the crew is unknown, but it is believed that they died of sickness. The Kingdom of Sweden It is not known when and how the kingdom of Sweden was born, but the list of Swedish monarchs is drawn from the first kings known to have ruled both Svealand (Sweden) and Götaland (Gothia) as one province, beginning with Eric the Victorious. Sweden and Gothia were two separate nations long before that and since antiquity. It is not known how long they existed: the epic poem Beowulf describes semi-legendary Swedish-Geatish wars in the 6th century. Götaland in this sense mainly includes the provinces of Östergötland (East Gothia) and Västergötland (West Gothia). The island of Gotland was disputed by other than Swedes, at this time (Danish, Hanseatic, and Gotland-domestic). Småland was at that time of little interest to anyone due to the deep pine forests, and only the city of Kalmar with its castle was of importance. The south-west parts of the Scandinavian peninsula consisted of three Danish provinces (Scania, Blekinge and Halland). North of Halland, Denmark had a direct border to Norway and its province Bohuslän. But there were Swedish settlements along the southern coastline of Norrland. Gamla Uppsala (Old Uppsala), a site of religious and political importance in the early days of Sweden During the early stages of the Scandinavian Viking Age, Ystad in the Danish province Scania and Paviken on Gotland were flourishing centres of trade, but they were not parts of the early Swedish Kingdom. Remains of what is believed to have been a large market dating from 600 to 700 CE have been found in Ystad.[43] In Paviken, an important centre of trade in the Baltic region during the 9th and 10th century, remains have been found of a large Viking Age harbour with shipbuilding yards and handicraft industries. Between 800 and 1000, trade brought an abundance of silver to Gotland, and according to some scholars, the Gotlanders of this era hoarded more silver than the rest of the population of Scandinavia combined.[43] St Ansgar is usually credited with introducing Christianity in 829, but the new religion did not begin to fully replace paganism until the 12th century. During the 11th century, Christianity became the prevalent religion, and from 1050 Sweden is counted as a Christian nation. The period between 1100 and 1400 was characterised by internal power struggles and competition among the Nordic kingdoms. In the years 1150–1293 according to the legend of Eric IX and the Eric Chronicles Swedish kings made a first, second and third crusade to pagan Finland against Finns, Tavastians and Karelians and started conflicts with the Rus' who no longer had any connection with Sweden.[44] The Swedish colonisation of the coastal areas of Finland started also during the 12th and 13th century.[45][46] In the 14th century, the Swedish colonisation of coastal areas of Finland began to be more organised and in the end of the century several of the coastal areas of Finland were inhabited mostly by Swedes.[47] Skog tapestry, made most probably during the late 13th century. Except for the provinces of Scania, Blekinge and Halland in the south-west of the Scandinavian peninsula, which were parts of the Kingdom of Denmark during this time, feudalism never developed in Sweden as it did in the rest of Europe.[48] The peasantry, therefore, remained largely a class of free farmers throughout most of Swedish history. Slavery (also called thralldom) was not common in Sweden,[49] and what slavery there was tended to be driven out of existence thanks to the spread of Christianity as well as to the difficulty to obtain slaves from the lands east of the Baltic Sea, and by the development of cities before the 16th century.[50] Indeed, both slavery and serfdom were abolished altogether by a decree of King Magnus IV in 1335. Former slaves tended to be absorbed into the peasantry, and some became labourers in the towns. Still, Sweden remained a poor and economically backward country in which barter was the primary means of exchange. For instance, the farmers of the province of Dalsland would transport their butter to the mining districts of Sweden and exchange it there for iron, which they would then take to the coast and trade for fish, which they consumed, while the iron would be shipped abroad.[51] In the middle of the 14th century, Sweden was struck by the Black Death.[52] The population of Sweden and most of Europe was decimated. The population (at same territory) did not reach the numbers of the year 1348 again until the beginning of the 19th century. One third of the population died in the triennium of 1349–1351. During this period, the Swedish cities began to acquire greater rights and were strongly influenced by German merchants of the Hanseatic League, active especially at Visby. In 1319, Sweden and Norway were united under King Magnus Eriksson, and in 1397 Queen Margaret I of Denmark effected the personal union of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark through the Kalmar Union. However, Margaret's successors, whose rule was also centred in Denmark, were unable to control the Swedish nobility. Gustav I liberated Sweden from Christian II of Denmark, ending the Kalmar Union. He established the House of Vasa which ruled Sweden and Poland until the 17th century Many times the Swedish crown was inherited by child kings over the course of the kingdom's existence; consequently, real power was held for long periods by regents (notably those of the Sture family) chosen by the Swedish parliament. King Christian II of Denmark, who asserted his claim to Sweden by force of arms, ordered a massacre of Swedish nobles in Stockholm in 1520. This came to be known as the ""Stockholm blood bath"" and stirred the Swedish nobility to new resistance and, on 6 June (now Sweden's national holiday) in 1523, they made Gustav Vasa their king.[53] This is sometimes considered as the foundation of modern Sweden. Shortly afterwards the new king rejected Catholicism and led Sweden into the Protestant Reformation. The Hanseatic League had been officially formed at Lübeck on the Baltic coast of Northern Germany in 1356. The League sought civil and commercial privileges from the princes and royalty of the countries and cities along the coasts of the Baltic Sea.[54] In exchange, they offered a certain amount of protection to the joining cities. Having their own navy, the Hansa were able to sweep the Baltic Sea free of pirates.[55] The privileges obtained by the Hansa included assurances that only Hansa citizens would be allowed to trade from the ports where they were located. They sought agreement to be free of all customs and taxes. With these concessions, Lübeck merchants flocked to Stockholm, where they soon came to dominate the city's economic life and made the port city of Stockholm into the leading commercial and industrial city of Sweden.[56] Under the Hanseatic trade, two-thirds of Stockholm's imports consisted of textiles, while the remaining third was salt. The main exports from Sweden were iron and copper.[56] However, the Swedes began to resent the monopoly trading position of the Hansa (mostly consisting of German citizens), and to resent the income they felt they lost to the Hansa. Consequently, when Gustav Vasa or Gustav I broke the monopoly power of the Hanseatic League he was regarded as a hero by the Swedish people.[57] History now views Gustav I as the father of the modern Swedish nation. The foundations laid by Gustav would take time to develop. Furthermore, when Sweden did develop, freed itself from the Hanseatic League, and entered its golden era, the fact that the peasantry had traditionally been free meant that more of the economic benefits flowed back to them rather than going to a feudal landowning class.[58] The end of the 16th century was marked by a final phase of rivalry between the remaining Catholics and the new Protestant communities. In 1592, Gustav Vasa's Catholic grandson and king of Poland, Sigismund, ascended the Swedish throne.[59] He pursued to strengthen Rome's influence by initiating Counter-Reformation and created a dual monarchy, which temporarily became known as the Polish-Swedish Union. His despotic rule, strongly characterized by intolerance towards the Protestants, sparked a civil war that plunged Sweden into poverty.[60] In opposition, Sigismund's uncle and successor, Charles Vasa, summoned the Uppsala Synod in 1593 which officially confirmed the modern Church of Sweden as Lutheran. Following his deposition in 1599, Sigismund attempted to reclaim the throne at every expense and hostilities between Poland and Sweden continued for the next one hundred years.[61] Swedish Empire Gustavus Adolphus at the Battle of Breitenfeld in 1631. See also: History of Sweden (1611–48), Swedish Empire, Swedish overseas colonies, Age of Liberty, Gustavian era, Sweden–Finland, and Union between Sweden and Norway During the 17th century, Sweden emerged as a European great power. Before the emergence of the Swedish Empire, Sweden was a poor and sparsely populated country on the fringe of European civilisation, with no significant power or reputation. Sweden rose to prominence on a continental scale during the tenure of king Gustavus Adolphus, seizing territories from Russia and Poland–Lithuania in multiple conflicts, including the Thirty Years' War.[62] During the Thirty Years' War, Sweden conquered approximately half of the Holy Roman states and defeated the Imperial army at the Battle of Breitenfeld in 1631.[63] Gustav Adolphus planned to become the new Holy Roman Emperor, ruling over a united Scandinavia and the Holy Roman states, but he died at the Battle of Lützen in 1632. After the Battle of Nördlingen in 1634, Sweden's only significant military defeat of the war, pro-Swedish sentiment among the German states faded.[63] These German provinces excluded themselves from Swedish power one by one, leaving Sweden with only a few northern German territories: Swedish Pomerania, Bremen-Verden and Wismar. From 1643 to 1645, during the last years of the war, Sweden and Denmark-Norway fought the Torstenson War. The result of that conflict and the conclusion of the Thirty Years' War helped establish postwar Sweden as a major force in Europe.[63] The Swedish Empire between 1611 and 1815, with its absolute peak between 1658 and 1660. In the middle of the 17th century Sweden was the third-largest country in Europe by land area, surpassed by only Russia and Spain. Sweden reached its largest territorial extent under the rule of Charles X after the treaty of Roskilde in 1658, following Charles X's risky but successful crossing of the Danish Belts.[64][65] The foundation of Sweden's success during this period is credited to Gustav I's major changes to the Swedish economy in the 16th century, and his introduction of Protestantism.[66] In the 17th century, Sweden was engaged in many wars, for example with the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, with both sides competing for territories of today's Baltic states, with the disastrous Battle of Kircholm being one of the highlights.[67] One-third of the Finnish population died in the devastating Great Famine of 1695–1697 that struck the country.[68] Famine also hit Sweden, killing roughly 10% of Sweden's population.[69] The Swedes conducted a series of invasions into the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, known as the Deluge.[70] After more than half a century of almost constant warfare, the Swedish economy had deteriorated. It became the lifetime task of Charles X's son, Charles XI, to rebuild the economy and refit the army.[71] His legacy to his son, the coming ruler of Sweden, Charles XII, was one of the finest arsenals in the world, a large standing army and a great fleet.[72] Sweden's largest threat at this time, Russia, had a larger army but was far behind in both equipment and training.[73] After the Battle of Narva in 1700, one of the first battles of the Great Northern War, the Russian army was so severely devastated that Sweden had an open chance to invade Russia.[74] However, Charles XII did not pursue the Russian army, instead turning against Poland–Lithuania and defeating the Polish king, Augustus II the Strong, and his Saxon allies at the Battle of Kliszów in 1702.[75] This gave Russia time to rebuild and modernise its army. The Battle of Poltava in 1709. In the following years, Russia and her allies occupied all Swedish dominions on the Baltic coast and even Finland. After the success of invading Poland, Charles XII decided to make an attempt at invading Russia, but this ended in a decisive Russian victory at the Battle of Poltava in 1709.[76] After a long march exposed to Cossack raids, the Russian Tsar Peter the Great's scorched-earth techniques and the extremely cold winter of 1709, the Swedes stood weakened with a shattered morale and were enormously outnumbered against the Russian army at Poltava.[77] The defeat meant the beginning of the end for the Swedish Empire. In addition, the plague raging in East Central Europe devastated the Swedish dominions and reached Central Sweden in 1710.[78][79] Returning to Sweden in 1715, Charles XII launched two campaigns against Norway on 1716 and 1718, respectively. During the second attempt, he was shot to death during the siege of Fredriksten fortress.[80] The Swedes were not militarily defeated at Fredriksten, but the whole structure and organisation of the campaign fell apart with the king's death, and the army withdrew. Forced to cede large areas of land in the Treaty of Nystad in 1721, Sweden also lost its place as an empire and as the dominant state on the Baltic Sea.[81] With Sweden's lost influence, Russia emerged as an empire and became one of Europe's dominant nations. As the war finally ended in 1721, Sweden had lost an estimated 200,000 men, 150,000 of those from the area of present-day Sweden and 50,000 from the Finnish part of Sweden.[82] In the 18th century, Sweden did not have enough resources to maintain its territories outside Scandinavia, and most of them were lost, culminating with the loss in 1809 of eastern Sweden to Russia, which became the highly autonomous Grand Principality of Finland in Imperial Russia.[83] In interest of re-establishing Swedish dominance in the Baltic Sea, Sweden allied itself against its traditional ally and benefactor, France, in the Napoleonic Wars. However, in 1810, a French Marshal, Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, was chosen as heir presumptive to the decrepit Charles XIII; in 1818, he established the House of Bernadotte, taking the regnal name of Charles XIV. Sweden's role in the Battle of Leipzig gave it the authority to force Denmark–Norway, an ally of France, to cede Norway to the King of Sweden on 14 January 1814 in exchange for the northern German provinces, at the Treaty of Kiel.[84] The Norwegian attempts to keep their status as a sovereign state were rejected by the Swedish king, Charles XIII. He launched a military campaign against Norway on 27 July 1814, ending in the Convention of Moss, which forced Norway into a personal union with Sweden under the Swedish crown, which lasted until 1905.[85] The 1814 campaign was the last time Sweden was at war.[86] Modern history See also: Modernization of Sweden and Swedish emigration to the United States Illustration of starvation in northern Sweden, Famine of 1867–1869 The Swedish East India Company, Ostindiska Kompaniet, began in 1731. The obvious choice of home port was Gothenburg at Sweden's west coast, the mouth of Göta älv river is very wide and has the county's largest and best harbour for high-seas journeys. The trade continued into the 19th century, and caused the little town to become Sweden's second city.[87] There was a significant population increase during the 18th and 19th centuries, which the writer Esaias Tegnér in 1833 attributed to ""the peace, the smallpox vaccine, and the potatoes"".[88] Between 1750 and 1850, the population in Sweden doubled. According to some scholars, mass emigration to America became the only way to prevent famine and rebellion; over 1% of the population emigrated annually during the 1880s.[89] Nevertheless, Sweden remained poor, retaining a nearly entirely agricultural economy even as Denmark and Western European countries began to industrialise.[89][90] Swedish emigrants boarding ship in Gothenburg in 1905 Many looked towards America for a better life during this time. It is thought that between 1850 and 1910 more than one million Swedes moved to the United States.[91] In the early 20th century, more Swedes lived in Chicago than in Gothenburg (Sweden's second largest city).[92] Most Swedish immigrants moved to the Midwestern United States, with a large population in Minnesota, with a few others moving to other parts of the United States and Canada. Despite the slow rate of industrialisation into the 19th century, many important changes were taking place in the agrarian economy due to constant innovations and a rapid population growth.[93] These innovations included government-sponsored programmes of enclosure, aggressive exploitation of agricultural lands, and the introduction of new crops such as the potato.[93] Because the Swedish peasantry had never been enserfed as elsewhere in Europe,[94][citation needed] the Swedish farming culture began to take on a critical role in Swedish politics, which has continued through modern times with modern Agrarian party (now called the Centre Party).[95] Between 1870 and 1914, Sweden began developing the industrialised economy that exists today.[96] Strong grassroots movements sprang up in Sweden during the latter half of the 19th century (trade unions, temperance groups, and independent religious groups), creating a strong foundation of democratic principles. In 1889 The Swedish Social Democratic Party was founded. These movements precipitated Sweden's migration into a modern parliamentary democracy, achieved by the time of World War I. As the Industrial Revolution progressed during the 20th century, people gradually moved into cities to work in factories and became involved in socialist unions. A communist revolution was avoided in 1917, following the re-introduction of parliamentarism, and the country was democratised. World War I and World War II Main articles: Sweden during World War I and Sweden during World War II Sweden was officially neutral during World War I, although, under German pressure, they did take steps which were detrimental to the Allied powers including mining the Øresund channel, thus closing it to Allied shipping, and allowing the Germans to use Swedish facilities and the Swedish cipher to transmit secret messages to their overseas embassies.[97] Sweden also allowed volunteers to fight for the White Guards alongside the Germans against the Red Guards and Russians in the Finnish Civil War, and briefly occupied the Åland Islands in co-operation with Germany. A Swedish soldier during World War II. Sweden remained neutral during the conflict. As in the First World War, Sweden remained officially neutral during World War II, although its neutrality during World War II has been disputed.[98][99] Sweden was under German influence for much of the war, as ties to the rest of the world were cut off through blockades.[98] The Swedish government felt that it was in no position to openly contest Germany,[100] and therefore made some concessions.[101] Sweden also supplied steel and machined parts to Germany throughout the war. The Swedish government unofficially supported Finland in the Winter War and the Continuation War by allowing volunteers and materiel to be shipped to Finland. However, Sweden supported Norwegian resistance against Germany, and in 1943 helped rescue Danish Jews from deportation to Nazi concentration camps. During the last year of the war, Sweden began to play a role in humanitarian efforts, and many refugees, among them several thousand Jews from Nazi-occupied Europe, were rescued thanks to the Swedish rescue missions to internment camps and partly because Sweden served as a haven for refugees, primarily from the Nordic countries and the Baltic states.[100] The Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg and his colleagues ensured the safety of tens of thousands of Hungarian Jews.[102] Nevertheless, both Swedes and others have argued that Sweden could have done more to oppose the Nazis' war efforts, even if it meant increasing the risk of occupation.[100] Post-war era Tage Erlander (left), Prime Minister under the ruling Swedish Social Democratic Party from 1946 to 1969. Sweden was officially a neutral country and remained outside NATO and Warsaw Pact membership during the Cold War, but privately Sweden's leadership had strong ties with the United States and other western governments. Following the war, Sweden took advantage of an intact industrial base, social stability and its natural resources to expand its industry to supply the rebuilding of Europe.[103] Sweden received aid under the Marshall Plan and participated in the OECD. During most of the post-war era, the country was governed by the Swedish Social Democratic Party largely in co-operation with trade unions and industry. The government actively pursued an internationally competitive manufacturing sector of primarily large corporations.[104] Sweden was one of the founding states of the European Free Trade Area (EFTA). During the 1960s the EFTA countries were often referred to as the Outer Seven, as opposed to the Inner Six of the then-European Economic Community (EEC).[105] Sweden, like many industrialised countries, entered a period of economic decline and upheaval following the oil embargoes of 1973–74 and 1978–79.[106] In the 1980s several key Swedish industries were significantly restructured. Shipbuilding was discontinued, wood pulp was integrated into modernised paper production, the steel industry was concentrated and specialised, and mechanical engineering was robotised.[107] Between 1970 and 1990, the overall tax burden rose by over 10%, and the growth was low compared with other countries in Western Europe. Eventually, the government began to spend over half of the country's gross domestic product. Swedish GDP per capita ranking declined during this time.[104] Recent history See also: History of Sweden (1991–present) Sweden joined the European Union in 1995 and signed the Lisbon Treaty in 2007. A bursting real estate bubble caused by inadequate controls on lending combined with an international recession and a policy switch from anti-unemployment policies to anti-inflationary policies resulted in a fiscal crisis in the early 1990s.[108] Sweden's GDP declined by around 5%. In 1992, a run on the currency caused the central bank to briefly increase interest rates to 500%.[109][110] The response of the government was to cut spending and institute a multitude of reforms to improve Sweden's competitiveness, among them reducing the welfare state and privatising public services and goods. Much of the political establishment promoted EU membership, and a referendum passed with 52.3% in favour of joining the EU on 13 November 1994. Sweden joined the European Union on 1 January 1995. In a 2003 referendum the Swedish electorate voted against the country joining the Euro currency. In 2006 Sweden got its first majority government for decades as the centre-right Alliance defeated the incumbent Social Democrat government. Following the rapid growth of support for the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats, and their entrance to the Riksdag in 2010, the Alliance became a minority cabinet. Sweden remains non-aligned militarily, although it participates in some joint military exercises with NATO and some other countries, in addition to extensive co-operation with other European countries in the area of defence technology and defence industry. Among others, Swedish companies export weapons that were used by the American military in Iraq.[111] Sweden also has a long history of participating in international military operations, including Afghanistan, where Swedish troops are under NATO command, and in EU-sponsored peacekeeping operations in Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Cyprus. Sweden also participated in enforcing a UN mandated no-fly zone over Libya during the Arab Spring. Sweden held the chair of the European Union from 1 July to 31 December 2009. Second day of the Stockholm Husby riots. The picture shows three cars on fire in the Stockholm suburb of Husby, 20 May 2013 In recent decades Sweden has become a more culturally diverse nation due to significant immigration; in 2013 it was estimated that 15 per cent of the population was foreign-born, and an additional 5 per cent of the population were born to two immigrant parents. The influx of immigrants has brought new social challenges. Violent incidents have periodically occurred[112][113] including the 2013 Stockholm riots which broke out following the police shooting of an elderly Portuguese immigrant.[114] In response to these violent events, the anti-immigration opposition party, the Sweden Democrats, promoted their anti-immigration policies, while the left-wing opposition blamed growing inequality caused by the centre-right government's socioeconomic policies.[115] In 2014, Stefan Löfven (Social Democrats) won the General Election and became the new Swedish Prime Minister. The Sweden Democrats held the balance of power and voted the government's budget down in the Riksdag, but due to agreements between the government and the Alliance, the government was able to hang onto power.[116] Sweden was heavily affected by the 2015 European migrant crisis, eventually forcing the government to tighten regulations of entry to the country, as Sweden received thousands of asylum seekers and migrants predominantly from Africa and the Middle East per week in autumn, overwhelming existing structures.[117] Some of the asylum restrictions were relaxed again later.[118] The 2018 general election saw the Red-greens lose seats to the right-wing Sweden Democrats and to the centre-right parties of the former Alliance. Despite holding only 33% of the seats in the Riksdag, the Social Democrats and the Greens managed to form a minority government in January 2019, relying on supply and confidence from the Centre Party, Liberals and the Left Party. Geography Main article: Geography of Sweden View of the Stora Sjöfallet National Park Situated in Northern Europe, Sweden lies west of the Baltic Sea and Gulf of Bothnia, providing a long coastline, and forms the eastern part of the Scandinavian Peninsula. To the west is the Scandinavian mountain chain (Skanderna), a range that separates Sweden from Norway. Finland is located to its north-east. It has maritime borders with Denmark, Germany, Poland, Russia, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, and it is also linked to Denmark (south-west) by the Öresund Bridge. Its border with Norway (1,619 km long) is the longest uninterrupted border within Europe. Sweden lies between latitudes 55° and 70° N, and mostly between longitudes 11° and 25° E (part of Stora Drammen island is just west of 11°). Scania in southern Sweden Sandhamn island, Stockholm archipelago At 449,964 km2 (173,732 sq mi), Sweden is the 55th-largest country in the world,[119] the fifth-largest country in Europe, and the largest country in Northern Europe. The lowest elevation in Sweden is in the bay of Lake Hammarsjön, near Kristianstad, at −2.41 m (−7.91 ft) below sea level. The highest point is Kebnekaise at 2,111 m (6,926 ft) above sea level. Sweden has 25 provinces or landskap, based on culture, geography and history. While these provinces serve no political or administrative purpose, they play an important role in people's self-identity. The provinces are usually grouped together in three large lands, parts, the northern Norrland, the central Svealand and southern Götaland. The sparsely populated Norrland encompasses almost 60% of the country. Sweden also has the Vindelfjällen Nature Reserve, one of the largest protected areas in Europe, totaling 562,772 ha (approx. 5,628 km2). About 15% of Sweden lies north of the Arctic Circle. Southern Sweden is predominantly agricultural, with increasing forest coverage northward. Around 65% of Sweden's total land area is covered with forests. The highest population density is in the Öresund Region in southern Sweden, along the western coast up to central Bohuslän, and in the valley of lake Mälaren and Stockholm. Gotland and Öland are Sweden's largest islands; Vänern and Vättern are its largest lakes. Vänern is the third largest in Europe, after Lake Ladoga and Lake Onega in Russia. Combined with the third- and fourth-largest lakes Mälaren and Hjälmaren, these lakes take up a significant part of the southern Sweden's area. Sweden's extensive waterway availability throughout the south was exploited with the building of the Göta Canal in the 19th century, shortening the potential distance between the Baltic Sea south of Norrköping and Gothenburg by using the lake and river network to facilitate the canal.[120] Climate Most of Sweden has a temperate climate, despite its northern latitude, with largely four distinct seasons and mild temperatures throughout the year. The winter in the far south is usually weak and is manifested only through some shorter periods with snow and sub-zero temperatures, autumn may well turn into spring there, without a distinct period of winter. The northern parts of the country have a subarctic climate while the central parts have a humid continental climate. The coastal south can be defined as having either a humid continental climate using the 0°C isotherm, or an oceanic climate using the -3°C isotherm. Sweden is much warmer and drier than other places at a similar latitude, and even somewhat farther south, mainly because of the combination of the Gulf Stream[121][122] and the general west wind drift, caused by the direction of planet Earth's rotation. Continental west-coasts (to which all of Scandinavia belongs, as the westernmost part of the Eurasian continent), are notably warmer than continental east-coasts; this can also be seen by comparing e.g. the Canadian cities of Vancouver and Halifax, Nova Scotia with each other, the winter in west coast Vancouver is much milder; also, for example, central and southern Sweden has much milder winters than many parts of Russia, Canada, and the northern United States.[123] Because of Sweden's high latitude, the length of daylight varies greatly. North of the Arctic Circle, the sun never sets for part of each summer, and it never rises for part of each winter. In the capital, Stockholm, daylight lasts for more than 18 hours in late June but only around 6 hours in late December. Sweden receives between 1,100 and 1,900 hours of sunshine annually.[124] During July there is not much difference in temperature between the north and south of the country. With the exception of in the mountains, the whole country has a July-average temperature within the range of 15 °C (59 °F) to 17.5 °C (63.5 °F) (a difference of 2.5 degrees Celsius), while the January-average temperatures vary from freezing point down to below −15 °C (5 °F) along the border with Finland (a difference of 15 degrees Celsius).[125] Köppen climate classification types of Sweden using the 0°C isotherm Köppen climate classification types of Sweden using the -3°C isotherm The highest temperature ever recorded in Sweden was 38 °C (100 °F) in Målilla in 1947,[citation needed] while the coldest temperature ever recorded was −52.6 °C (−62.7 °F) in Vuoggatjålme on 2 February 1966.[126] Temperatures expected in Sweden are heavily influenced by the large Fennoscandian landmass, as well as continental Europe and western Russia, which allows hot or cool inland air to be easily transported to Sweden. That, in turn, renders most of Sweden's southern areas having warmer summers than almost everywhere in the nearby British Isles, even matching temperatures found along the continental Atlantic coast as far south as in northern Spain. In winter, however, the same high-pressure systems sometimes put the entire country far below freezing temperatures. There is some maritime moderation from the Atlantic which renders the Swedish continental climate less severe than that of nearby Russia. Even though temperature patterns differ between north and south, the summer climate is surprisingly similar all through the entire country in spite of the large latitudinal differences. This is due to the south's being surrounded by a greater mass of water, with the wider Baltic Sea and the Atlantic air passing over lowland areas from the south-west. Apart from the ice-free Atlantic bringing marine air into Sweden tempering winters, the mildness is further explained by prevailing low-pressure systems postponing winter, with the long nights often staying above freezing in the south of the country due to the abundant cloud cover. By the time winter finally breaks through, daylight hours rise quickly, ensuring that daytime temperatures soar quickly in spring. With the greater number of clear nights, frosts remain commonplace quite far south as late as April. The cold winters occur when low-pressure systems are weaker. An example is that the coldest ever month (January 1987) in Stockholm was also the sunniest January month on record.[127][128] The relative strength of low and high-pressure systems of marine and continental air also define the highly variable summers. When hot continental air hits the country, the long days and short nights frequently bring temperatures up to 30 °C (86 °F) or above even in coastal areas. Nights normally remain cool, especially in inland areas. Coastal areas can see so-called tropical nights above 20 °C (68 °F) occur due to the moderating sea influence during warmer summers.[129] Summers can be cool, especially in the north of the country. Transitional seasons are normally quite extensive and the four-season climate applies to most of Sweden's territory, except in Scania where some years do not record a meteorological winter (see table below) or in the high Lapland mountains where polar microclimates exist. On average, most of Sweden receives between 500 and 800 mm (20 and 31 in) of precipitation each year, making it considerably drier than the global average. The south-western part of the country receives more precipitation, between 1,000 and 1,200 mm (39 and 47 in), and some mountain areas in the north are estimated to receive up to 2,000 mm (79 in). Despite northerly locations, southern and central Sweden may have almost no snow in some winters. Most of Sweden is located in the rain shadow of the Scandinavian Mountains through Norway and north-west Sweden. The blocking of cool and wet air in summer, as well as the greater landmass, leads to warm and dry summers far north in the country, with quite warm summers at the Bothnia Bay coast at 65 degrees latitude, which is unheard of elsewhere in the world at such northerly coastlines. It is predicted that as the Barents Sea gets less frozen in the coming winters, becoming thus ""Atlantified"", additional evaporation will increase future snowfalls in Sweden and much of continental Europe.[130] Vegetation See also: Wildlife of Sweden Map of Sweden's five major vegetation zones Sweden has a considerable south to north distance (stretching between the latitudes N 55:20:13 and N 69:03:36) which causes large climatic difference, especially during the winter. The related matter of the length and strength of the four seasons plays a role in which plants that naturally can grow at various places. Sweden is divided in five major vegetation zones. These are: The southern deciduous forest zone The southern coniferous forest zone The northern coniferous forest zone, or the Taiga The alpine-birch zone The bare mountain zone Southern deciduous forest zone, also known as the nemoral region, the southern deciduous forest zone is a part of a larger vegetation zone which also includes Denmark and large parts of Central Europe. It has to a rather large degree become agricultural areas, but larger and smaller forests still exist. The region is characterised by a large wealth of trees and shrubs. The beech are the most dominant tree, but oak can also form smaller forests. elm at one time formed forests, but have been heavily reduced due to Dutch Elm disease. Other important trees and shrubs in this zone include hornbeam, elder, hazel, fly honeysuckle, linden (lime), spindle, yew, alder buckthorn, blackthorn, aspen, European rowan, Swedish whitebeam, juniper, European holly, ivy, dogwood, goat willow, larch, bird cherry, wild cherry, maple, ash, alder along creeks, and in sandy soil birch compete with pine.[131] Spruce is not native but between approximately 1870 and 1980, large areas were planted with it.[132] They tend to grow too quickly due to being outside of their native range[133] and large distances between the tree rings cause poor board quality.[134] Later some spruce trees began to die before reaching optimal height, and many more of the coniferous trees were uprooted during cyclones.[135][136] During the last 40–50 years large areas of former spruce plantings have been replanted with deciduous forest.[137] Southern coniferous forest zone, also known as the boreo-nemoral region, the southern coniferous forest zone is delimited by the oak's northern natural limit (limes norrlandicus) and the Spruce's southern natural limit,[138] between the southern deciduous zone and the Taiga farther north. In the southern parts of this zone the coniferous species are found, mainly spruce and pine, mixed with various deciduous trees. Birch grows largely everywhere. The beech's northern boundary crosses this zone. This is however not the case with oak and ash. Although in its natural area, also planted Spruce are common, and such woods are very dense, as the spruces can grow very tight, especially in this vegetation zone's southern areas. The northern coniferous forest zone or the Taiga begins north of the natural boundary of the oak. Of deciduous species the birch is the only one of significance. Pine and spruce are dominant, but the forests are slowly but surely more sparsely grown the farther towards the north it gets. In the extreme north is it difficult to state the trees forms true forests at all, due to the large distances between the trees.[139] The alpine-birch zone, in the Scandinavian mountains, depending on both latitude and altitude, is an area where only a smaller kind of birch (Betula pubescens or B.tortuosa) can grow. Where this vegetation zone ends, no trees grow at all: the bare mountain zone.[140] Sweden had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 5.35/10, ranking it 103th globally out of 172 countries.[141] Politics Constitutional framework Main article: Politics of Sweden The current King of Sweden, Carl XVI Gustaf, and his consort, Queen Silvia Sweden has four fundamental laws (Swedish: grundlagar) which together form the Constitution: the Instrument of Government (Swedish: Regeringsformen), the Act of Succession (Swedish: Successionsordningen), the Freedom of the Press Act (Swedish: Tryckfrihetsförordningen), and the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression (Swedish: Yttrandefrihetsgrundlagen).[142][143] The public sector in Sweden is divided into two parts: the legal person known as the State (Swedish: staten)[b] and local authorities:[c] the latter include regional County Councils (Swedish: landsting) and local Municipalities (Swedish: kommuner).[144][145][146][147] The local authorities, rather than the State, make up the larger part of the public sector in Sweden.[148] County Councils and Municipalities are independent of one another, the former merely covers a larger geographical area than the latter.[148][149] The local authorities have self-rule, as mandated by the Constitution, and their own tax base.[145][150] Notwithstanding their self-rule, local authorities are nevertheless in practice interdependent upon the State, as the parameters of their responsibilities and the extent of their jurisdiction are specified in the Local Government Act (Swedish: Kommunallagen) passed by the Riksdag.[145][151] Sweden is a constitutional monarchy, and King Carl XVI Gustaf is the head of state, but the role of the monarch is limited to ceremonial and representative functions.[152] Under the provisions of the 1974 Instrument of Government, the King lacks any formal political power.[153][154] The King opens the annual Riksdag session, chairs the Special Council held during a change of Government, holds regular Information Councils with the Prime Minister and the Government, chairs the meetings of the Advisory Council on Foreign Affairs (Swedish: Utrikesnämnden), and receives Letters of Credence of foreign ambassadors to Sweden and signs those of Swedish ambassadors sent abroad.[155][156] In addition, the King pays State Visits abroad and receives those incoming as host.[155] Apart from strictly official duties, the King and the other members of Royal Family undertake a variety of unofficial and other representative duties within Sweden and abroad.[157] Legislative power is vested in the unicameral Riksdag with 349 members. General elections are held every four years, on the second Sunday of September. Legislation may be initiated by the Government or by members of the Riksdag. Members are elected on the basis of proportional representation to a four-year term. The internal workings of the Riksdag are, in addition to the Instrument of Government, regulated by the Riksdag Act (Swedish: Riksdagsordningen).[158] The fundamental laws can be altered by the Riksdag alone; only an absolute majority with two separate votes, separated by a general election in between, is required.[142] Rosenbad, in central Stockholm, has been the seat of the Government since 1981.[159] The Government (Swedish: Regeringen) operates as a collegial body with collective responsibility and consists of the Prime Minister — appointed and dismissed by the Speaker of the Riksdag (following an actual vote in the Riksdag before an appointment can be made) — and other cabinet ministers (Swedish: Statsråd), appointed and dismissed at the sole discretion of the Prime Minister.[160] The Government is the supreme executive authority and is responsible for its actions to the Riksdag.[161] Most of the State administrative authorities (Swedish: statliga förvaltningsmyndigheter) report to the Government, including (but not limited to) the Armed Forces, the Enforcement Authority, the National Library, the Swedish police and the Tax Agency. A unique feature of Swedish State administration is that individual cabinet ministers do not bear any individual ministerial responsibility for the performance of the agencies within their portfolio; as the director-generals and other heads of government agencies reports directly to the Government as a whole; and individual ministers are prohibited to interfere; thus the origin of the pejorative in Swedish political parlance term ministerstyre (English: ""ministerial rule"") in matters that are to be handled by the individual agencies, unless otherwise specifically provided for in law. The Judiciary is independent from the Riksdag, Government and other State administrative authorities.[162] The role of judicial review of legislation is not practised by the courts; instead, the Council on Legislation gives non-binding opinions on legality.[163] There is no stare decisis in that courts are not bound by precedent, although it is influential.[164] Political parties and elections Main articles: List of political parties in Sweden and Elections in Sweden The Riksdag chamber, at the time of a vote, in 2009 The Swedish Social Democratic Party has played a leading role in Swedish politics since 1917, after the Reformists had confirmed their strength and the left-wing revolutionaries formed their own party. After 1932, most governments have been dominated by the Social Democrats. Only five general elections since World War II—1976, 1979, 1991, 2006 and 2010—have given the assembled bloc of centre-right parties enough seats in the Riksdag to form a government. For over 50 years, Sweden had had five parties who continually received enough votes to gain seats in the Riksdag—the Social Democrats, the Moderate Party, the Centre Party, the Liberal People's Party and the Left Party—before the Green Party became the sixth party in the 1988 election. In the 1991 election, while the Greens lost their seats, two new parties gained seats for the first time: the Christian Democrats and New Democracy. The 1994 election saw the return of the Greens and the demise of New Democracy. It was not until elections in 2010 that an eighth party, the Sweden Democrats, gained Riksdag seats. In the elections to the European Parliament, parties who have failed to pass the Riksdag threshold have managed to gain representation at that venue: the June List (2004–2009), the Pirate Party (2009–2014), and Feminist Initiative (2014–2019). The party leaders lined up before the start of the televised live debate on 12 September 2014. In the 2006 general election the Moderate Party formed the centre-right Alliance for Sweden bloc and won a majority of the Riksdag seats. In the 2010 general election the Alliance contended against a unified left block consisting of the Social Democrats, the Greens and the Left Party.[165] The Alliance won a plurality of 173 seats, but remained two seats short of a 175-seat majority. Nevertheless, neither the Alliance, nor the left block, chose to form a coalition with the Sweden Democrats.[166] The outcome of the 2014 general election resulted in the attainment of more seats by the three centre-left parties in comparison to the centre-right Alliance for Sweden, with the two blocs receiving 159 and 141 seats respectively.[167] The non-aligned Sweden Democrats more than doubled their support and won the remaining 49 seats.[167] On 3 October 2014, Stefan Löfven formed a minority government consisting of the Social Democrats and the Greens.[168][169] Election turnout in Sweden has always been high by international comparison. Although it declined in recent decades, the latest elections saw an increase in voter turnout (80.11% in 2002, 81.99% in 2006, 84.63% in 2010, 85.81 in 2014)[170] and 87.18% in 2018.[171] Swedish politicians enjoyed a high degree of confidence from the citizens in the 1960s, However, that level of confidence has since declined steadily, and is now at a markedly lower level than in its Scandinavian neighbours.[172] Administrative divisions Main articles: Counties of Sweden and Municipalities of Sweden Municipal divisions of Sweden Sweden is a unitary state divided into 21 county councils (landsting) and 290 municipalities (kommuner). Every county council corresponds to a county (län) with a number of municipalities per county. County councils and municipalities have different roles and separate responsibilities relating to local government. Health care, public transport and certain cultural institutions are administered by county councils. Preschools, primary and secondary schooling, public water utilities, garbage disposal, elderly care and rescue services are administered by the municipalities. Gotland is a special case of being a county council with only one municipality and the functions of county council and municipality are performed by the same organisation.[173] Municipal and county council government in Sweden is similar to city commission and cabinet-style council government. Both levels have legislative assemblies (municipal councils and county council assemblies of between 31 and 101 members (always an uneven number) that are elected from party-list proportional representation at the general election which are held every four years in conjunction with the national parliamentary elections. Municipalities are also divided into a total of 2,512 parishes (församlingar). These have no official political responsibilities but are traditional subdivisions of the Church of Sweden and still have some importance as census districts for census-taking and elections. The Swedish government has 21 County Administrative Boards (Swedish: länsstyrelser), which are responsible for regional state administration not assigned to other government agencies or local government. Each county administrative boards is led by a County Governor (Swedish: landshövding) appointed for a term of six years. The list of previous officeholders for the counties stretches back, in most cases, to 1634 when the counties were created by Lord High Chancellor Count Axel Oxenstierna. The main responsibility of the County Administrative Board is to co-ordinate the development of the county in line with goals set by the Riksdag and Government. There are older historical divisions, primarily the twenty-five provinces and three lands, which still retain cultural significance. Further information: Subdivisions of Sweden and National Areas of Sweden Political history Kingdoms of Svear (Sweonas) and Götar (Geats) in the 12th century, with modern borders in grey The actual age of the kingdom of Sweden is unknown.[174] Establishing the age depends mostly on whether Sweden should be considered a nation when the Svear (Sweonas) ruled Svealand or if the emergence of the nation started with the Svear and the Götar (Geats) of Götaland being united under one ruler. In the first case, Svealand was first mentioned as having one single ruler in the year 98 by Tacitus, but it is almost impossible to know for how long it had been this way. However, historians usually start the line of Swedish monarchs from when Svealand and Götaland were ruled under the same king, namely Eric the Victorious (Geat) and his son Olof Skötkonung in the 10th century. These events are often described as the consolidation of Sweden, although substantial areas were conquered and incorporated later. Earlier kings, for which no reliable historical sources exist, can be read about in mythical kings of Sweden and semi-legendary kings of Sweden. Many of these kings are only mentioned in various saga and blend with Norse mythology. The title Sveriges och Götes Konung was last used for Gustaf I of Sweden, after which the title became ""King of Sweden, of the Goths and of the Wends"" (Sveriges, Götes och Vendes Konung) in official documentation. Up until the beginning of the 1920s, all laws in Sweden were introduced with the words, ""We, the king of Sweden, of the Goths and Wends"". This title was used up until 1973.[175] The present King of Sweden, Carl XVI Gustaf, was the first monarch officially proclaimed ""King of Sweden"" (Sveriges Konung) with no additional peoples mentioned in his title. The term riksdag was used for the first time in the 1540s, although the first meeting where representatives of different social groups were called to discuss and determine affairs affecting the country as a whole took place as early as 1435, in the town of Arboga.[176] During the Riksdag assemblies of 1527 and 1544, under King Gustav Vasa, representatives of all four estates of the realm (clergy, nobility, townsmen and peasants) were called on to participate for the first time.[176] The monarchy became hereditary in 1544. Executive power was historically shared between the King and an aristocratic Privy council until 1680, followed by the King's autocratic rule initiated by the commoner estates of the Riksdag. As a reaction to the failed Great Northern War, a parliamentary system was introduced in 1719, followed by three different flavours of constitutional monarchy in 1772, 1789 and 1809, the latter granting several civil liberties. Already during the first of those three periods, the 'Era of Liberty' (1719–72) the Swedish Rikstag had developed into a very active Parliament, and this tradition continued into the nineteenth century, laying the basis for the transition towards modern democracy at the end of that century.[177] In 1866 Sweden became a constitutional monarchy with a bicameral parliament, with the First Chamber indirectly elected by local governments, and the Second Chamber directly elected in national elections every four years. In 1971 the parliament became unicameral. Legislative power was (symbolically) shared between the King and the Riksdag until 1975. Swedish taxation is controlled by the Riksdag. The Riksdag, the Swedish Parliament in 2014 Sweden has a history of strong political involvement by ordinary people through its ""popular movements"" (Folkrörelser), the most notable being trade unions, the independent Christian movement, the temperance movement, the women's movement, and the intellectual property pirate movements. Sweden was the first country in the world to outlaw corporal punishment of children by their parents (parents' right to spank their own children was first removed in 1966, and it was explicitly prohibited by law from July 1979[178]). Sweden is currently leading the EU in statistics measuring equality in the political system and equality in the education system.[179] The Global Gender Gap Report 2006 ranked Sweden as the number one country in terms of gender equality.[180] Some Swedish political figures have become known worldwide, among these are: Raoul Wallenberg, Folke Bernadotte, the former Secretary-General of the United Nations Dag Hammarskjöld, the former Prime Minister Olof Palme, the former Prime Minister and later Foreign minister Carl Bildt, the former President of the General Assembly of the United Nations Jan Eliasson, and the former International Atomic Energy Agency Iraq inspector Hans Blix. Judicial system Main article: Judiciary of Sweden The courts are divided into two parallel and separate systems: The general courts (allmänna domstolar) for criminal and civil cases, and general administrative courts (allmänna förvaltningsdomstolar) for cases relating to disputes between private persons and the authorities.[181] Each of these systems has three tiers, where the top tier court of the respective system typically only will hear cases that may become precedent. There are also a number of special courts, which will hear a narrower set of cases, as set down by legislation. While independent in their rulings, some of these courts are operated as divisions within courts of the general or general administrative courts. Bonde Palace in Stockholm, seat of the Supreme Court of Sweden The Supreme Court of Sweden (Swedish: Högsta domstolen) is the third and final instance in all civil and criminal cases in Sweden. Before a case can be decided by the Supreme Court, leave to appeal must be obtained, and with few exceptions, leave to appeal can be granted only when the case is of interest as a precedent. The Supreme Court consists of 16 Justices (Swedish: justitieråd), appointed by the Government, but the court as an institution is independent of the Riksdag, and the Government is not able to interfere with the decisions of the court. According to a victimisation survey of 1,201 residents in 2005, Sweden has above-average crime rates compared to other EU countries. Sweden has high or above-average levels of assaults, sexual assaults, hate crimes, and consumer fraud. Sweden has low levels of burglary, car theft and drug problems. Bribe seeking is rare.[182] A mid-November 2013 news report announced that four prisons in Sweden were closed during the year due to a significant drop in the number of inmates. The decrease in the number of Swedish prisoners was considered ""out-of-the-ordinary"" by the head of Sweden's prison and probation services, with prison numbers in Sweden falling by around 1% a year since 2004. Prisons were closed in the towns of Åby, Håja, Båtshagen, and Kristianstad.[183] Foreign relations Main article: Foreign relations of Sweden The EU parliament in Brussels. Sweden is a member state of the European Union. Throughout the 20th century, Swedish foreign policy was based on the principle of non-alignment in peacetime and neutrality in wartime. Sweden's government pursued an independent course of nonalignment in times of peace so that neutrality would be possible in the event of war.[103] Sweden's doctrine of neutrality is often traced back to the 19th century as the country has not been in a state of war since the end of the Swedish campaign against Norway in 1814. During World War II Sweden joined neither the allied nor axis powers. This has sometimes been disputed since in effect Sweden allowed in select cases the Nazi regime to use its railroad system to transport troops and goods,[98][100] especially iron ore from mines in northern Sweden, which was vital to the German war machine.[100][184] However, Sweden also indirectly contributed to the defence of Finland in the Winter War, and permitted the training of Norwegian and Danish troops in Sweden after 1943. Development aid measured in GNI in 2009. Source: OECD. As a percentage Sweden is the largest donor. During the early Cold War era, Sweden combined its policy of non-alignment and a low profile in international affairs with a security policy based on strong national defence.[185] The function of the Swedish military was to deter attack.[186] At the same time, the country maintained relatively close informal connections with the Western bloc, especially in the realm of intelligence exchange. In 1952, a Swedish DC-3 was shot down over the Baltic Sea by a Soviet MiG-15 jet fighter. Later investigations revealed that the plane was actually gathering information for NATO.[187] Another plane, a Catalina search and rescue plane, was sent out a few days later and shot down by the Soviets as well. Prime Minister Olof Palme made an official visit to Cuba during the 1970s, during which he denounced Fulgencio Batista's government and praised contemporary Cuban and Cambodian revolutionaries in a speech. Beginning in the late 1960s, Sweden attempted to play a more significant and independent role in international relations. It involved itself significantly in international peace efforts, especially through the United Nations, and in support to the Third World. On 27 October 1981, a Whiskey-class submarine (U 137) from the Soviet Union ran aground close to the naval base at Karlskrona in the southern part of the country. Research has never clearly established whether the submarine ended up on the shoals through a navigational mistake or if an enemy committed espionage against Swedish military potential. The incident triggered a diplomatic crisis between Sweden and the Soviet Union. Following the 1986 assassination of Olof Palme and with the end of the Cold War, Sweden has adopted a more traditional foreign policy approach. Nevertheless, the country remains active in peace keeping missions and maintains a considerable foreign aid budget. Since 1995 Sweden has been a member of the European Union, and as a consequence of a new world security situation the country's foreign policy doctrine has been partly modified, with Sweden playing a more active role in European security co-operation. Military Main articles: Swedish Armed Forces and Law enforcement in Sweden The Saab JAS 39 Gripen is an advanced Swedish multi-role fighter aircraft of the Swedish Air Force. The law is enforced in Sweden by several government entities. The Swedish police is a Government agency concerned with police matters. The National Task Force is a national SWAT unit within the police force. The Swedish Security Service's responsibilities are counter-espionage, anti-terrorist activities, protection of the constitution and protection of sensitive objects and people. The Försvarsmakten (Swedish Armed Forces) are a government agency reporting to the Swedish Ministry of Defence and responsible for the peacetime operation of the armed forces of Sweden. The primary task of the agency is to train and deploy peacekeeping forces abroad, while maintaining the long-term ability to refocus on the defence of Sweden in the event of war. The armed forces are divided into Army, Air Force and Navy. The head of the armed forces is the Supreme Commander (Överbefälhavaren, ÖB), the most senior commissioned officer in the country. Up to 1974, the King was pro forma Commander-in-Chief, but in reality it was clearly understood through the 20th century that the monarch would have no active role as a military leader. The Infantry fighting vehicle CV90, which is produced and used by Sweden Until the end of the Cold War, nearly all males reaching the age of military service were conscripted. In recent years, the number of conscripted males has shrunk dramatically, while the number of female volunteers has increased slightly. Recruitment has generally shifted towards finding the most motivated recruits, rather than solely focusing on those otherwise most fit for service. By law, all soldiers serving abroad must be volunteers. In 1975, the total number of conscripts was 45,000. By 2003, it was down to 15,000. On 1 July 2010, Sweden ended routine conscription, switching to an all-volunteer force unless otherwise required for defence readiness.[188][189][190] Emphasis was to be placed on only recruiting those later prepared to volunteer for international service. The total forces gathered would consist of about 60,000 personnel. This in comparison with the 1980s, before the fall of the Soviet Union, when Sweden could gather up to 1,000,000 servicemembers. However, on 11 December 2014, due to tensions in the Baltic area, the Swedish Government reintroduced one part of the Swedish conscription system, refresher training.[191] On 2 March 2017, the government decided to reintroduce the remaining part of the Swedish conscription system, basic military training. The first recruits began their training in 2018. As the law is now gender neutral, both men and women may have to serve.[192] Sweden decided not to sign the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.[193] Swedish units have taken part in peacekeeping operations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cyprus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Liberia, Lebanon, Afghanistan and Chad. Economy Main article: Economy of Sweden Gross Regional Product (GRP) per capita in thousands of kronor (2014) A proportional representation of Sweden exports, 2019 Sweden is the sixteenth-richest country in the world in terms of GDP (gross domestic product) per capita and a high standard of living is experienced by its citizens. Sweden is an export-oriented mixed economy. Timber, hydropower and iron ore constitute the resource base of an economy with a heavy emphasis on foreign trade. Sweden's engineering sector accounts for 50% of output and exports, while telecommunications, the automotive industry and the pharmaceutical industries are also of great importance. Sweden is the ninth-largest arms exporter in the world. Agriculture accounts for 2% of GDP and employment. The country ranks among the highest for telephone and Internet access penetration.[194] Trade unions, employers' associations and collective agreements cover a large share of the employees in Sweden.[195][196] The high coverage of collective agreements is achieved despite the absence of state mechanisms extending collective agreements to whole industries or sectors. Both the prominent role of collective bargaining and the way in which the high rate of coverage is achieved reflect the dominance of self-regulation (regulation by the labour market parties themselves) over state regulation in Swedish industrial relations.[197] When the Swedish Ghent system was changed in 2007, resulting in considerably raised fees to unemployment funds, a substantial decline in union density and density of unemployment funds occurred.[198][199] Sweden is home to Volvo Cars, an automobile company with its headquarters in Gothenburg In 2010 Sweden's income Gini coefficient was the third lowest among developed countries, at 0.25—slightly higher than Japan and Denmark—suggesting Sweden had low income inequality. However, Sweden's wealth Gini coefficient at 0.853 was the second highest in developed countries, and above European and North American averages, suggesting high wealth inequality.[200][201] Even on a disposable income basis, the geographical distribution of Gini coefficient of income inequality varies within different regions and municipalities of Sweden. Danderyd, outside Stockholm, has Sweden's highest Gini coefficient of income inequality, at 0.55, while Hofors near Gävle has the lowest at 0.25. In and around Stockholm and Scania, two of the more densely populated regions of Sweden, the income Gini coefficient is between 0.35 and 0.55.[202] In terms of structure, the Swedish economy is characterised by a large, knowledge-intensive and export-oriented manufacturing sector; an increasing, but comparatively small, business service sector; and by international standards, a large public service sector. Large organisations, both in manufacturing and services, dominate the Swedish economy.[203] High and medium-high technology manufacturing accounts for 9.9% of GDP.[204] The 20 largest (by turnover) registered Swedish companies in 2007 were Volvo, Ericsson, Vattenfall, Skanska, Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications AB, Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget, Electrolux, Volvo Personvagnar, TeliaSonera, Sandvik, Scania, ICA, Hennes & Mauritz, IKEA, Nordea, Preem, Atlas Copco, Securitas, Nordstjernan and SKF.[205] The vast majority of Sweden's industry is privately controlled, unlike many other industrialised Western countries, and, in accordance with a historical standard, publicly owned enterprises are of minor importance. Real GDP growth in Sweden, 1996–2006 An estimated 4.5 million Swedish residents are employed and around a third of the workforce completed tertiary education. In terms of GDP per-hour-worked, Sweden was the world's ninth highest in 2006 at US$31, compared to US$22 in Spain and US$35 in the United States.[206] GDP per-hour-worked is growing 2.5% per year for the economy as a whole and the trade-terms-balanced productivity growth is 2%.[206] According to the OECD, deregulation, globalisation, and technology sector growth have been key productivity drivers.[206] Sweden is a world leader in privatised pensions and pension funding problems are relatively small compared to many other Western European countries.[207] A pilot program to test the feasibility of a six-hour workday, without loss of pay, will commence in 2014, involving the participation of Gothenburg municipal staff. The Swedish government is seeking to reduce its costs through decreased sick leave hours and increased efficiency.[208] Sweden is part of the Schengen Area and the EU single market. The typical worker receives 40% of his or her labour costs after the tax wedge. Total tax collected by Sweden as a percentage of its GDP peaked at 52.3% in 1990.[209] The country faced a real estate and banking crisis in 1990–1991, and consequently passed tax reforms in 1991 to implement tax rate cuts and tax base broadening over time.[210][211] Since 1990, taxes as a percentage of GDP collected by Sweden have been dropping, with total tax rates for the highest income earners dropping the most.[212] In 2010 45.8% of the country's GDP was collected as taxes, the second highest among OECD countries, and nearly double the percentage in the US or South Korea.[209] Tax income-financed employment represents a third of the Swedish workforce, a substantially higher proportion than in most other countries. Overall, GDP growth has been fast since reforms—especially those in manufacturing—were enacted in the early 1990s.[213] Nordstan is one of the largest shopping malls in northern Europe Sweden is the fourth-most competitive economy in the world, according to the World Economic Forum in its Global Competitiveness Report 2012–2013.[28] Sweden is the top performing country in the 2014 Global Green Economy Index (GGEI).[214] Sweden is ranked fourth in the IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook 2013.[215] According to the book The Flight of the Creative Class by the US economist Professor Richard Florida of the University of Toronto, Sweden is ranked as having the best creativity in Europe for business and is predicted to become a talent magnet for the world's most purposeful workers. The book compiled an index to measure the kind of creativity it claims is most useful to business—talent, technology and tolerance.[216] Sweden maintains its own currency, the Swedish krona (SEK), a result of the Swedes having rejected the euro in a referendum. The Swedish Riksbank—founded in 1668 and thus the oldest central bank in the world—is currently focusing on price stability with an inflation target of 2%. According to the Economic Survey of Sweden 2007 by the OECD, the average inflation in Sweden has been one of the lowest among European countries since the mid-1990s, largely because of deregulation and quick utilisation of globalisation.[206] The largest trade flows are with Germany, the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Denmark and Finland. Financial deregulation in the 1980s impacted adversely on the property market, leading to a bubble and eventually a crash in the early 1990s. Commercial property prices fell by up to two thirds, resulting in two Swedish banks having to be taken over by the government. In the following two decades the property sector strengthened. By 2014, legislators, economists and the IMF were again warning of a bubble with residential property prices soaring and the level of personal mortgage debt expanding. Household debt-to-income rose above 170% as the IMF was calling on legislators to consider zoning reform and other means of generating a greater supply of housing as demand was outstripping what was available, pushing prices higher. By August 2014, 40% of home borrowers had interest-only loans while those that didn't were repaying principal at a rate that would take 100 years to fully repay.[217] Energy See also: Energy in Sweden, Electricity in Sweden, Nordic energy market, and Nuclear power in Sweden Ringhals Nuclear Power Plant, located south of Gothenburg Sweden's energy market is largely privatised. The Nordic energy market is one of the first liberalised energy markets in Europe and it is traded in NASDAQ OMX Commodities Europe and Nord Pool Spot. In 2006, out of a total electricity production of 139 TWh, electricity from hydropower accounted for 61 TWh (44%), and nuclear power delivered 65 TWh (47%). At the same time, the use of biofuels, peat etc. produced 13 TWh (9%) of electricity, while wind power produced 1 TWh (1%). Sweden was a net importer of electricity by a margin of 6 TWh.[218] Biomass is mainly used to produce heat for district heating and central heating and industry processes. The 1973 oil crisis strengthened Sweden's commitment to decrease dependence on imported fossil fuels. Since then, electricity has been generated mostly from hydropower and nuclear power. The use of nuclear power has been limited, however. Among other things, the accident of Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station (United States) prompted the Riksdag to ban new nuclear plants. In March 2005, an opinion poll showed that 83% supported maintaining or increasing nuclear power.[219] Politicians have made announcements about oil phase-out in Sweden, decrease of nuclear power, and multibillion-dollar investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency.[220][221] The country has for many years pursued a strategy of indirect taxation as an instrument of environmental policy, including energy taxes in general and carbon dioxide taxes in particular.[220] Sweden was in 2014 a net exporter of electricity by a margin of 16 TWh; the production from windpower mills had increased to 11.5 TWh.[222] Transport Main article: Transport in Sweden The Öresund Bridge between Malmö and Copenhagen in Denmark Sweden has 162,707 km (101,101 mi) of paved road and 1,428 km (887 mi) of expressways. Motorways run through Sweden and over the Øresund Bridge to Denmark. New motorways are still under construction and a new motorway from Uppsala to Gävle was finished on 17 October 2007. Sweden had left-hand traffic (Vänstertrafik in Swedish) from approximately 1736 and continued to do so well into the 20th century. Voters rejected right-hand traffic in 1955, but after the Riksdag passed legislation in 1963 changeover took place on 3 September 1967, known in Swedish as Dagen H. The Stockholm metro is the only underground system in Sweden and serves the city of Stockholm via 100 stations. The rail transport market is privatised, but while there are many privately owned enterprises, the largest operators are still owned by state. The counties have financing, ticket and marketing responsibility for local trains. For other trains the operators handle tickets and marketing themselves. Operators include SJ, Veolia Transport, DSB, Green Cargo, Tågkompaniet and Inlandsbanan. Most of the railways are owned and operated by Trafikverket. Stockholm Central Station Most tram nets were closed in 1967, as Sweden changed from left-side to right-side driving. But they survived in Norrköping, Stockholm and Gothenburg, with Gothenburg tram network being the largest. A new tram line opened in Lund on 13 December 2020. The largest airports include Stockholm–Arlanda Airport (16.1 million passengers in 2009) 40 km (25 mi) north of Stockholm, Göteborg Landvetter Airport (4.3 million passengers in 2008), and Stockholm–Skavsta Airport (2.0 million passengers). Sweden hosts the two largest port companies in Scandinavia, Port of Göteborg AB (Gothenburg) and the transnational company Copenhagen Malmö Port AB. The most used airport for a large part of Southern Sweden is Kastrup or Copenhagen Airport which is located only 12 minutes by train from the closest Swedish railway station, Hyllie. Copenhagen Airport also is the largest international airport in Scandinavia and Finland. Sweden also has a number of car ferry connections to several neighbouring countries.[223] This includes a route from Umeå across the Gulf of Bothnia to Vaasa in Finland. There are several connections from the Stockholm area across the Sea of Åland to Mariehamn in the Åland Islands as well as Turku and Helsinki on the Finnish mainland and beyond to Estonia and St Petersburg in Russia. Ferry routes from the Stockholm area also connect with Ventspils and Riga in Latvia as well as Gdańsk in Poland across the Baltic Sea. The ferry ports of Karlskrona and Karlshamn in southeastern Sweden serve Gdynia, Poland, and Klaipeda, Lithuania. Ystad and Trelleborg near the southern tip of Sweden have ferry links with the Danish island of Bornholm and the German ports of Sassnitz, Rostock and Travemünde, respectively, and ferries run to Świnoujście, Poland, from both of them. Trelleborg is the busiest ferry port in Sweden in terms of weight transported by lorry.[224] Its route to Sassnitz started as a steam-operated railway ferry in the 19th century, and today's ferry still carries trains to Berlin during the summer months.[225] Another ferry route to Travemünde originates from Malmö. Despite the opening of the fixed link to Denmark, the Øresund Bridge, the busiest ferry route remains the short link across the narrowest section of the Øresund between Helsingborg and the Danish port of Helsingør, known as the HH Ferry route. There are over seventy departures a day each way; during peak times, a ferry departs every fifteen minutes.[226] Ports higher up the Swedish west coast include Varberg, with a ferry connection across the Kattegat to Grenaa in Denmark, and Göteborg, serving Frederikshavn at the northern tip of Denmark and Kiel in Germany. Finally, there are ferries from Strömstad near the Norwegian border to destinations around the Oslofjord in Norway. There used to be ferry services to the United Kingdom from Göteborg to destinations such as Immingham, Harwich and Newcastle, but these have been discontinued. Sweden has two domestic ferry lines with large vessels, both connecting Gotland with the mainland. The lines leave from Visby harbour on the island, and the ferries sail to either Oskarshamn or Nynäshamn.[227] A smaller car ferry connects the island of Ven in Øresund with Landskrona.[228] Public policy See also: Nordic model and Social welfare in Sweden Sweden has one of the most highly developed welfare states in the world. According to a 2012 OECD report, the country had the second-highest public social spending as a percentage of its GDP after France (27.3% and 28.4%, respectively), and the third-highest total (public and private) social spending at 30.2% of its GDP, after France and Belgium (31.3% and 31.0%, respectively).[229] Sweden spent 6.3% of its GDP, the 9th-highest among 34 OECD countries, to provide equal access to education.[230] On health care, the country spent 10.0% of its total GDP, the 12th highest.[231] Historically, Sweden provided solid support for free trade (except agriculture) and mostly relatively strong and stable property rights (both private and public), though some economists have pointed out that Sweden promoted industries with tariffs and used publicly subsidised R&D during the country's early critical years of industrialisation.[232] After World War II a succession of governments expanded the welfare state by raising the taxes. During this period Sweden's economic growth was also one of the highest in the industrial world. A series of successive social reforms transformed the country into one of the most equal and developed on earth. The consistent growth of the welfare state led to Swedes achieving unprecedented levels of social mobility and quality of life—to this day Sweden consistently ranks at the top of league tables for health, literacy and Human Development—far ahead of some wealthier countries (for example the United States).[233] However, from the 1970s and onwards Sweden's GDP growth fell behind other industrialised countries and the country's per capita ranking fell from 4th to 14th place in a few decades.[234] From the mid-1990s until today Sweden's economic growth has once again accelerated and has been higher than in most other industrialised countries (including the US) during the last 15 years.[235] A report from the United Nations Development Program predicted that Sweden's rating on the Human Development Index will fall from 0.949 in 2010 to 0.906 in 2030.[236] Sweden began slowing the expansion of the welfare state in the 1980s, and even trimming it back. Sweden has been relatively quick to adopt neoliberal policies, such as privatization, financialization and deregulation,[237][238] compared to countries such as France.[206][239] The current Swedish government is continuing the trend of moderate rollbacks of previous social reforms.[206][240] Growth has been higher than in many other EU-15 countries. Also since the mid-1980s, Sweden has had the fastest growth in inequality of any developed nation, according to the OECD. This has largely been attributed to the reduction in state benefits and a shift toward the privatisation of public services. According to Barbro Sorman, an activist of the opposition Left Party, ""The rich are getting richer, and the poor are getting poorer. Sweden is starting to look like the USA."" Nevertheless, it remains far more egalitarian than most nations.[115][241] Partly as a result of these privatisations and widening economic disparity, the Swedes in the 2014 elections put the Social Democrats back in power.[242][243] Sweden adopted free market agricultural policies in 1990. Since the 1930s, the agricultural sector had been subject to price controls. In June 1990, the Riksdag voted for a new agricultural policy marking a significant shift away from price controls. As a result, food prices fell somewhat. However, the liberalisations soon became moot because EU agricultural controls supervened.[244] Since the late 1960s, Sweden has had the highest tax quota (as percentage of GDP) in the industrialised world, although today the gap has narrowed and Denmark has surpassed Sweden as the most heavily taxed country among developed countries. Sweden has a two-step progressive tax scale with a municipal income tax of about 30% and an additional high-income state tax of 20–25% when a salary exceeds roughly 320,000 SEK per year. Payroll taxes amount to 32%. In addition, a national VAT of 25% is added to many things bought by private citizens, with the exception of food (12% VAT), transportation, and books (6% VAT). Certain items are subject to additional taxes, e.g. electricity, petrol/diesel and alcoholic beverages. In 2007[update], total tax revenue was 47.8% of GDP, the second-highest tax burden among developed countries, down from 49.1% 2006.[245] Sweden's inverted tax wedge – the amount going to the service worker's wallet – is approximately 15%, compared to 10% in Belgium, 30% in Ireland, and 50% in the United States.[234] Public sector spending amounts to 53% of the GDP. State and municipal employees total around a third of the workforce, much more than in most Western countries. Only Denmark has a larger public sector (38% of Danish workforce). Spending on transfers is also high. In 2015 and 2016, 69 per cent of the employed workers is organised in trade unions. Union density in 2016 was 62% among blue-collar-workers (most of them in the Swedish Trade Union Confederation, LO) and 75% among white-collar workers (most of them in the Swedish Confederation of Professional Employees, TCO, and the Swedish Confederation of Professional Associations, SACO).[246] Sweden has state-supported union unemployment funds (Ghent system).[247] Trade unions have the right to elect two representatives to the board in all Swedish companies with more than 25 employees. Sweden has a relatively high amount of sick leave per worker in OECD: the average worker loses 24 days due to sickness.[213] The unemployment rate was 7.2% in May 2017 while the employment rate was 67.4%, with the workforce consisting of 4,983,000 people while 387,000 are unemployed.[248][249] Unemployment among youth (aged 24 or younger) in 2012 was 24.2%, making Sweden the OECD country with the highest ratio of youth unemployment versus unemployment in general.[250] Science and technology Main article: Swedish inventions Alfred Nobel, inventor of dynamite and institutor of the Nobel Prize In the 18th century, Sweden's scientific revolution took off. Previously, technical progress had mainly come from mainland Europe. In 1739, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences was founded, with people such as Carl Linnaeus and Anders Celsius as early members. Many of the companies founded by early pioneers still remain major international brands. Gustaf Dalén founded AGA, and received the Nobel Prize for his sun valve. Alfred Nobel invented dynamite and instituted the Nobel Prizes. Lars Magnus Ericsson started the company bearing his name, Ericsson, still one of the largest telecom companies in the world. Jonas Wenström was an early pioneer in alternating current and is along with Serbian-American inventor Nikola Tesla credited as one of the inventors of the three-phase electrical system.[251] The traditional engineering industry is still a major source of Swedish inventions, but pharmaceuticals, electronics and other high-tech industries are gaining ground. Tetra Pak was an invention for storing liquid foods, invented by Erik Wallenberg. Losec, an ulcer medicine, was the world's best-selling drug in the 1990s and was developed by AstraZeneca. More recently Håkan Lans invented the Automatic Identification System, a worldwide standard for shipping and civil aviation navigation. A large portion of the Swedish economy is to this day based on the export of technical inventions, and many large multinational corporations from Sweden have their origins in the ingenuity of Swedish inventors.[251] Swedish inventors held 47,112 patents in the United States in 2014[update], according to the United States Patent and Trademark Office. As a nation, only ten other countries hold more patents than Sweden.[252] Combined, the public and the private sector in Sweden allocate over 3.5% of GDP to research & development (R&D) per year, making Sweden's investment in R&D as a percentage of GDP the second-highest in the world.[253] For several decades the Swedish government has prioritised scientific and R&D activities. As a percentage of GDP, the Swedish government spends the most of any nation on research and development.[254] Sweden tops other European countries in the number of published scientific works per capita.[255] Swedish–ESO Submillimetre Telescope discovered the Boomerang Nebula and the first extragalactic silicon monoxide maser.[256] In 2009, the decisions to construct Sweden's two largest scientific installations, the synchrotron radiation facility MAX IV Laboratory and the European Spallation Source (ESS), were taken.[257][258] Both installations will be built in Lund. The European Spallation Source, costing some SEK 14 billion to construct,[259] will begin initial operations in 2019 with construction completion scheduled for 2025. The ESS will give an approximately 30 times stronger neutron beam than any of today's existing neutron source installations.[260] The MAX IV, costing some SEK 3 billion, was inaugurated on 21 June 2016. Both facilities have strong implications on material research. Taxes Main article: Taxation in Sweden On average, 27% of taxpayer's money in Sweden goes to education and healthcare, whereas 5% goes to the police and military, and 42% to social security.[261] The typical worker receives 40% of his or her labour costs after the tax wedge. Total tax collected by Sweden as a percentage of its GDP peaked at 52.3% in 1990.[209] The country faced a real estate and banking crisis in 1990–1991, and consequently passed tax reforms in 1991 to implement tax rate cuts and tax base broadening over time.[210][211] Since 1990, taxes as a percentage of GDP collected by Sweden have been dropping, with total tax rates for the highest income earners dropping the most.[212] In 2010 45.8% of the country's GDP was collected as taxes, the second highest among OECD countries, and nearly double the percentage in the US or South Korea.[209] Pensions Main article: Social security in Sweden Every Swedish resident receives a state pension. Swedish Pensions Agency is responsible for pensions. People who have worked in Sweden, but relocated to another country, can also receive the Swedish pension. There are several types of pensions in Sweden: national retirement, occupational and private pensions. A person can receive a combination of the various types of pensions. Demographics Main articles: Demographics of Sweden and Swedes Population density in the counties of Sweden.people/km²  0–9.9  10–24.9  25–49.9  50–99.9  100–199.9  200+ The total resident population of Sweden was 10,377,781 in October 2020.[12] The population exceeded 10 million for the first time on Friday 20 January 2017.[262][263] The average population density is just over 25 people per km2 (65 per square mile), with 1 437 persons per km2 in localities (continuous settlement with at least 200 inhabitants).[264],[265] 87% of the population live in urban areas, which cover 1.5% of the entire land area.[266] 63% of Swedes are in large urban areas.[266] It is substantially higher in the south than in the north. The capital city Stockholm has a municipal population of about 950,000 (with 1.5 million in the urban area and 2.3 million in the metropolitan area). The second- and third-largest cities are Gothenburg and Malmö. Greater Gothenburg counts just over a million inhabitants and the same goes for the western part of Scania, along the Öresund. The Öresund Region, the Danish-Swedish cross-border region around the Öresund that Malmö is part of, has a population of 4 million. Outside of major cities, areas with notably higher population density include the agricultural part of Östergötland, the western coast, the area around Lake Mälaren and the agricultural area around Uppsala. Norrland, which covers approximately 60% of the Swedish territory, has a very low population density (below 5 people per square kilometre). The mountains and most of the remote coastal areas are almost unpopulated. Low population density exists also in large parts of western Svealand, as well as southern and central Småland. An area known as Finnveden, which is located in the south-west of Småland, and mainly below the 57th parallel, can also be considered as almost empty of people. Between 1820 and 1930, approximately 1.3 million Swedes, a third of the country's population at the time, emigrated to North America, and most of them to the United States. There are more than 4.4 million Swedish Americans according to a 2006 US Census Bureau estimate.[267] In Canada, the community of Swedish ancestry is 330,000 strong.[268] There are no official statistics on ethnicity, but according to Statistics Sweden, around 2,634,967 (25.5%) inhabitants of Sweden were of a foreign background in 2019, defined as being born abroad or born in Sweden with foreign born parents.[269] Of these inhabitants, 2,019,733 persons were born abroad and 615,234 persons were born in Sweden to parents born abroad. In addition, 780,199 persons had one parent born abroad with the other parent born in Sweden. Sweden has one of the oldest populations in the world, with the average age of 41.1 years.[270] vte Largest cities or towns in Sweden""Kommungruppsindelning 2017"".

Norwegians have little difficulty understanding Swedish, and Danes can also understand it, with slightly more difficulty than Norwegians. The same goes for standard Swedish speakers, who find it far easier to understand Norwegian than Danish. The dialects spoken in Scania, the southernmost part of the country, are influenced by Danish because the region traditionally was a part of Denmark and is nowadays situated closely to it. Sweden Finns are Sweden's largest linguistic minority, comprising about 5% of Sweden's population,[271] and Finnish is recognised as a minority language.[17] Owing to a 21st-century influx of native speakers of Arabic, the use of Arabic is likely more widespread in the country than that of Finnish. However, no official statistics are kept on language use.[272] Along with Finnish, four other minority languages are also recognised: Meänkieli, Sami, Romani, and Yiddish. Swedish became Sweden's official language on 1 July 2009, when a new language law was implemented.[17] The issue of whether Swedish should be declared the official language had been raised in the past, and the Riksdag voted on the matter in 2005, but the proposal narrowly failed.[273] In varying degrees, depending largely on frequency of interaction with English, a majority of Swedes, especially those born after World War II, understand and speak English, owing to trade links, the popularity of overseas travel, a strong Anglo-American influence and the tradition of subtitling rather than dubbing foreign television shows and films, and the relative similarity of the two languages which makes learning English easier. In a 2005 survey by Eurobarometer, 89% of Swedes reported the ability to speak English.[274] English became a compulsory subject for secondary school students studying natural sciences as early as 1849, and has been a compulsory subject for all Swedish students since the late 1940s.[275] Depending on the local school authorities, English is currently a compulsory subject between first grade and ninth grade, with all students continuing in secondary school studying English for at least another year. Most students also study one and sometimes two additional languages. These include (but are not limited to) German, French and Spanish. Some Danish and Norwegian is at times also taught as part of Swedish courses for native speakers. Because of the extensive mutual intelligibility between the three continental Scandinavian languages Swedish speakers often use their native language when visiting or living in Norway or Denmark. Religion Main article: Religion in Sweden Religions in Sweden (2018)[5] Church of Sweden (57.7%)  Other Protestants (3.4%)  Eastern Orthodox Churches (1.7%)  Catholic Church (1.2%)  Other Christian denominations (0.3%)  Islam (1.9%)  Other religions (0.3%)  Unaffiliated (33.5%) Before the 11th century, Swedes adhered to Norse paganism, worshiping Æsir gods, with its centre at the Temple in Uppsala. With Christianisation in the 11th century, the laws of the country changed, forbidding worship of other deities until the late 19th century. After the Protestant Reformation in the 1530s, a change led by Martin Luther's Swedish associate Olaus Petri, the authority of the Roman Catholic Church was abolished and Lutheranism became widespread. Adoption of Lutheranism was completed by the Uppsala Synod of 1593, and it became the official religion. During the era following the Reformation, usually known as the period of Lutheran orthodoxy, small groups of non-Lutherans, especially Calvinist Dutchmen, the Moravian Church and French Huguenots played a significant role in trade and industry, and were quietly tolerated as long as they kept a low religious profile.[276] The Sami originally had their own shamanistic religion, but they were converted to Lutheranism by Swedish missionaries in the 17th and 18th centuries. The Protestant Katarina Church in Stockholm The second oldest mosque in Sweden is the Malmö Mosque, inaugurated in 1984 With religious liberalisations in the late 18th century believers of other faiths, including Judaism and Roman Catholicism, were allowed to live and work freely in the country. However, until 1860 it remained illegal for Lutherans to convert to another religion. The 19th century saw the arrival of various evangelical free churches, and, towards the end of the century, secularism, leading many to distance themselves from church rituals. Leaving the Church of Sweden became legal with the so-called dissenter law of 1860, but only under the provision of entering another Christian denomination. The right to stand outside any religious denomination was formally established in the law on freedom of religion in 1951. In 2000, the Church of Sweden was disestablished. Sweden was the second Nordic country to disestablish its state church (after Finland did so in the Church Act of 1869).[277] At the end of 2018, 57.7% of Swedes belonged to the Church of Sweden; this number had been decreasing by about 1.5 percentage points a year for the previous 7 years and one percentage point a year on average for the previous two decades.[278][279][280] Approximately 2% of the church's members regularly attend Sunday services.[281] The reason for the large number of inactive members is partly that, until 1996, children automatically became members at birth if at least one of the parents was a member. Since 1996, only children and adults who are christened become members. Some 275,000 Swedes are today members of various Evangelical Protestant free churches (where congregation attendance is much higher), and due to recent immigration, there are now some 100,000 Eastern Orthodox Christians and 92,000 Roman Catholics living in Sweden.[282] The first Muslim congregation was established in 1949, when a small contingent of Tatars migrated from Finland. Islam's presence in Sweden remained marginal until the 1960s, when Sweden started to receive migrants from the Balkans and Turkey. Further immigration from North Africa and the Middle East have brought the estimated Muslim population to 600,000.[283] However, only about 110,000 were members of a congregation around 2010.[284][285][286] According to the Eurobarometer Poll 2010,[287] 18% of Swedish citizens responded that ""they believe there is a god"". 45% answered that ""they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force"". 34% answered that ""they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, god, or life force"". According to a Demoskop study in 2015 about the beliefs of the Swedish showed that 21% believed in a god (down from 35 percent in 2008). 16% believed in ghosts. 14% believed in creationism or intelligent design.[288][289] Sociology professor Phil Zuckerman claims that Swedes, despite a lack of belief in God, commonly question the term atheist, preferring to call themselves Christians while being content with remaining in the Church of Sweden.[290] Religion continues to play a role in Swedish cultural identity.[291] This is evidenced by the fact that the majority of Swedish adults continue to remain members of the Lutheran Church despite having to pay a church tax; moreover, rates of baptism remain high and church weddings are increasing in Sweden.[291] Health See also: Healthcare in Sweden and Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare Healthcare in Sweden is mainly tax-funded, universal for all citizens and decentralized,[292] although private health care also exists. The health care system in Sweden is financed primarily through taxes levied by county councils and municipalities. A total of 21 councils are in charge with primary and hospital care within the country. Private healthcare is a rarity in Sweden, and even those private institutions work under the mandated city councils.[293] The city councils regulates the rules and the establishment of potential private practices. Although in most countries care for the elderly or those who need psychiatric help is conducted privately, in Sweden local, publicly funded authorities are in charge of this type of care.[294] Healthcare in Sweden is similar in quality to other developed nations. Sweden ranks in the top five countries with respect to low infant mortality. It also ranks high in life expectancy and in safe drinking water.[295] In 2018, health and medical care represented around 11 per cent of GDP.[296] Education Main article: Education in Sweden Uppsala University (established 1477) Children aged 1–5 years old are guaranteed a place in a public kindergarten (Swedish: förskola or, colloquially, dagis). Between the ages of 6 and 16, children attend compulsory comprehensive school. In the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), Swedish 15-year-old pupils score close to the OECD average.[297] After completing the 9th grade, about 90% of the students continue with a three-year upper secondary school (gymnasium), which can lead to both a job qualification or entrance eligibility to university. The school system is largely financed by taxes. The Swedish government treats public and independent schools equally[298] by introducing education vouchers in 1992 as one of the first countries in the world after the Netherlands. Anyone can establish a for-profit school and the municipality must pay new schools the same amount as municipal schools get. School lunch is free for all students in Sweden, and providing breakfast is also encouraged.[299] There are a number of different universities and colleges in Sweden, the oldest and largest of which are situated in Uppsala, Lund, Gothenburg and Stockholm. In 2000, 32% of Swedish people held a tertiary degree, making the country 5th in the OECD in that category.[300] Along with several other European countries, the government also subsidises tuition of international students pursuing a degree at Swedish institutions, although a recent bill passed in the Riksdag will limit this subsidy to students from EEA countries and Switzerland.[301] The large influx of immigrants to Swedish schools has been cited as a significant part of the reason why Sweden has dropped more than any other European country in the international PISA rankings.[302][303][304][305] Immigration Main article: Immigration to Sweden Immigration has been a major source of population growth and cultural change throughout much of the history of Sweden, and in recent centuries the country has been transformed from a nation of net emigration, ending after World War I, to a nation of net immigration, from World War II onwards. The economic, social, and political aspects of immigration have caused controversy regarding ethnicity, economic benefits, jobs for non-immigrants, settlement patterns, impact on upward social mobility, crime, and voting behaviour.[306] There are no exact numbers on the ethnic background of migrants and their descendants in Sweden because the Swedish government does not base any statistics on ethnicity. This is, however, not to be confused with the migrants' national backgrounds, which are recorded. Immigrants in Sweden are mostly concentrated in the urban areas of Svealand and Götaland.[307] Since the early 1970s, immigration to Sweden has been mostly due to refugee migration and family reunification from countries in the Middle East and Latin America.[308] In 2019, Sweden granted 21,958 people asylum, and 21,502 in 2018.[309] The ten largest groups of foreign-born persons in the Swedish civil registry in 2019 were from:[310] Syria (191,530) Iraq (146,048) Finland (144,561) Poland (93,722) Iran (80,136) Somalia (70,173) Former Yugoslavia (64,349) Bosnia and Herzegovina (60,012) Afghanistan (58,780) Turkey (51,689) According to an official investigation by The Swedish Pensions Agency on order from the government, the immigration to Sweden will double the state's expenses for pensions to the population. The total immigration to Sweden for 2017 will be roughly 180 000 people, and after that 110 000 individuals every year.[311][312] Crime Main article: Crime in Sweden Further information: Bombings in Sweden and Rape in Sweden Figures from the 2013 Swedish Crime Survey (SCS) show that exposure to crime decreased from 2005 to 2013.[313] Since 2014 there has been an increase in exposure to some categories of crimes, including fraud, some property crime and especially sexual offences (with a 70% increase since 2013, which was partly caused by laws broadening the definition of rape[314]) according to the 2016 SCS.[315] Violence (both lethal and non-lethal) has been on a downward trend the last 25 years.[316] The figures for fraud and property damage (excluding car theft) are in contrast with the numbers of reported crimes under such categories which have remained roughly constant over the period 2014–16.[317] The number of reported sexual offences clearly reflect the figures in the 2016 SCS, and car related damages/theft are also somewhat reflected.[318][319] The number of convictions up to 2013 has remained between 110,000 and 130,000 in the 2000s — a decrease since the 1970s, when they numbered around 300,000 — despite the population growth.[320] Consistent with other Western countries in the postwar era, the number of reported crimes has increased when measured from the 1950s; which can be explained by a number of factors, such as immigration, statistical and legislative changes and increased public willingness to report crime.[321] Culture Main article: Culture of Sweden Nationalmuseum in Stockholm Sweden has many authors of worldwide recognition including August Strindberg, Astrid Lindgren, and Nobel Prize winners Selma Lagerlöf and Harry Martinson. In total seven Nobel Prizes in Literature have been awarded to Swedes. The nation's most well-known artists are painters such as Carl Larsson and Anders Zorn, and the sculptors Tobias Sergel and Carl Milles. Swedish 20th-century culture is noted by pioneering works in the early days of cinema, with Mauritz Stiller and Victor Sjöström. In the 1920s–1980s, the filmmaker Ingmar Bergman and actors Greta Garbo and Ingrid Bergman became internationally noted people within cinema. More recently, the films of Lukas Moodysson, Lasse Hallström, and Ruben Östlund have received international recognition. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s Sweden was seen as an international leader in what is now referred to as the ""sexual revolution"", with gender equality having particularly been promoted.[322] The early Swedish film I Am Curious (Yellow) (1967) reflected a liberal view of sexuality, including scenes of love making that caught international attention, and introduced the concept of the ""Swedish sin"" that had been introduced earlier in the US with Ingmar Bergman's Summer with Monika. The image of ""hot love and cold people"" emerged. Sexual liberalism was seen as part of modernisation process that by breaking down traditional borders would lead to the emancipation of natural forces and desires.[323] Sweden has also become very liberal towards homosexuality, as is reflected in the popular acceptance of films such as Show Me Love, which is about two young lesbians in the small Swedish town of Åmål. Since 1 May 2009, Sweden repealed its ""registered partnership"" laws and fully replaced them with gender-neutral marriage,[324] Sweden also offers domestic partnerships for both same-sex and opposite-sex couples. Cohabitation (sammanboende) by couples of all ages, including teenagers as well as elderly couples, is widespread. As of 2009, Sweden is experiencing a baby boom.[325] Music Main article: Music of Sweden The Swedish band ABBA in April 1974, a few days after they won the Eurovision Song Contest Historical re-creations of Norse music have been attempted based on instruments found in Viking sites. The instruments used were the lur (a sort of trumpet), simple string instruments, wooden flutes and drums. Sweden has a significant folk-music scene. The joik, a type of Sami music, is a chant that is part of the traditional Sami animistic spirituality. Notable composers include Carl Michael Bellman and Franz Berwald. Sweden also has a prominent choral music tradition. Out of a population of 9.5 million, it is estimated that five to six hundred thousand people sing in choirs.[326] In 2007, with over 800 million dollars in revenue, Sweden was the third-largest music exporter in the world and surpassed only by the US and the UK.[327][328][better source needed] According to one source 2013, Sweden produces the most chart hits per capita in the world, followed by the UK and the USA.[329] Sweden has a rather lively jazz scene. During the last sixty years or so it has attained a remarkably high artistic standard, stimulated by domestic as well as external influences and experiences. The Centre for Swedish Folk Music and Jazz Research has published an overview of jazz in Sweden by Lars Westin.[330] Architecture Main article: Architecture of Sweden Djurgårdsbron Before the 13th century almost all buildings were made of timber, but a shift began towards stone. Early Swedish stone buildings are the Romanesque churches on the country side. As so happens, many of them were built in Scania and are in effect Danish churches. This would include the Lund Cathedral from the 11th century and the somewhat younger church in Dalby, but also many early Gothic churches built through influences of the Hanseatic League, such as in Ystad, Malmö and Helsingborg. Cathedrals in other parts of Sweden were also built as seats of Sweden's bishops. The Skara Cathedral is of bricks from the 14th century, and the Uppsala Cathedral in the 15th. In 1230 the foundations of the Linköping Cathedral were made, the material was there limestone, but the building took some 250 years to finish. Among older structures are also some significant fortresses and other historical buildings such as at Borgholm Castle, Halltorps Manor and Eketorp fortress on the island Öland, the Nyköping fortress and the Visby city wall. Kalmar Cathedral Around 1520 Sweden was out of the Middle Ages and united under King Gustav Vasa, who immediately initiated grand mansions, castles and fortresses to be built. Some of the more magnificent include Kalmar Castle, Gripsholm Castle and the one at Vadstena. In the next two centuries, Sweden was designated by Baroque architecture and later the rococo. Notable projects from that time include the city Karlskrona, which has now also been declared a World Heritage Site and the Drottningholm Palace. 1930 was the year of the great Stockholm exhibition, which marked the breakthrough of Functionalism, or ""funkis"" as it became known. The style came to dominate in the following decades. Some notable projects of this kind were the Million Programme, offering affordable living in large apartment complexes. The Ericsson Globe is the largest hemispherical building on Earth, Shaped like a large white ball, and took two and a half years to build. It's located in Stockholm. Media Main article: Media in Sweden Headquarters of Sveriges Television in Stockholm Swedes are among the greatest consumers of newspapers in the world, and nearly every town is served by a local paper. The country's main quality morning papers are Dagens Nyheter (liberal), Göteborgs-Posten (liberal), Svenska Dagbladet (liberal conservative) and Sydsvenska Dagbladet (liberal). The two largest evening tabloids are Aftonbladet (social democratic) and Expressen (liberal). The ad-financed, free international morning paper, Metro International, was founded in Stockholm, Sweden. The country's news is reported in English by, among others, The Local (liberal).[331] The public broadcasting companies held a monopoly on radio and television for a long time in Sweden. Licence funded radio broadcasts started in 1925. A second radio network was started in 1954 and a third opened 1962 in response to pirate radio stations. Non-profit community radio was allowed in 1979 and in 1993 commercial local radio started. The licence-funded television service was officially launched in 1956. A second channel, TV2, was launched in 1969. These two channels (operated by Sveriges Television since the late 1970s) held a monopoly until the 1980s when cable and satellite television became available. The first Swedish language satellite service was TV3 which started broadcasting from London in 1987. It was followed by Kanal 5 in 1989 (then known as Nordic Channel) and TV4 in 1990. In 1991 the government announced it would begin taking applications from private television companies wishing to broadcast on the terrestrial network. TV4, which had previously been broadcasting via satellite, was granted a permit and began its terrestrial broadcasts in 1992, becoming the first private channel to broadcast television content from within the country. Around half the population are connected to cable television. Digital terrestrial television in Sweden started in 1999 and the last analogue terrestrial broadcasts were terminated in 2007. Literature Main article: Swedish literature The writer and playwright August Strindberg The first literary text from Sweden is the Rök runestone, carved during the Viking Age c. 800 AD. With the conversion of the land to Christianity around 1100 AD, Sweden entered the Middle Ages, during which monastic writers preferred to use Latin. Therefore, there are only a few texts in the Old Swedish from that period. Swedish literature only flourished when the Swedish language was standardised in the 16th century, a standardisation largely due to the full translation of the Bible into Swedish in 1541. This translation is the so-called Gustav Vasa Bible. With improved education and the freedom brought by secularisation, the 17th century saw several notable authors develop the Swedish language further. Some key figures include Georg Stiernhielm (17th century), who was the first to write classical poetry in Swedish; Johan Henric Kellgren (18th century), the first to write fluent Swedish prose; Carl Michael Bellman (late 18th century), the first writer of burlesque ballads; and August Strindberg (late 19th century), a socio-realistic writer and playwright who won worldwide fame. The early 20th century continued to produce notable authors, such as Selma Lagerlöf, (Nobel laureate 1909), Verner von Heidenstam (Nobel laureate 1916) and Pär Lagerkvist (Nobel laureate 1951). In recent decades, a handful of Swedish writers have established themselves internationally, including the detective novelist Henning Mankell and the writer of spy fiction Jan Guillou. The Swedish writer to have made the most lasting impression on world literature is the children's book writer Astrid Lindgren, and her books about Pippi Longstocking, Emil, and others. In 2008, the second best-selling fiction author in the world was Stieg Larsson, whose Millennium series of crime novels is being published posthumously to critical acclaim.[332] Larsson drew heavily on the work of Lindgren by basing his central character, Lisbeth Salander, on Longstocking.[333] Holidays Main article: Public holidays in Sweden Walpurgis Night bonfire in Sweden Apart from traditional Protestant Christian holidays, Sweden also celebrates some unique holidays, some of a pre-Christian tradition. They include Midsummer celebrating the summer solstice; Walpurgis Night (Valborgsmässoafton) on 30 April lighting bonfires; and Labour Day or Mayday on 1 May is dedicated to socialist demonstrations. The day of giver-of-light Saint Lucia, 13 December, is widely acknowledged in elaborate celebrations which betoken its Italian origin and commence the month-long Christmas season. 6 June is the National Day of Sweden and has since 2005 been a public holiday. Furthermore, there are official flag flying day observances and a Namesdays in Sweden calendar. In August many Swedes have kräftskivor (crayfish dinner parties). Martin of Tours Eve is celebrated in Scania in November with Mårten Gås parties, where roast goose and svartsoppa ('black soup', made of goose stock, fruit, spices, spirits and goose blood) are served. The Sami, one of Sweden's indigenous minorities, have their holiday on 6 February and Scania celebrate their Scanian Flag day on the third Sunday in July.[334] Cuisine Main article: Swedish cuisine Cinnamon rolls originated in Sweden and Denmark. Swedish cuisine, like that of the other Nordic countries (Denmark, Norway and Finland), was traditionally simple. Fish (particularly herring), meat, potatoes and dairy products played prominent roles. Spices were sparse. Preparations include Swedish meatballs, traditionally served with gravy, boiled potatoes and lingonberry jam; pancakes; pyttipanna, a spiced fried hash of meat and potatoes originally meant to use up any left-overs of meat; lutfisk; and the smörgåsbord, or lavish buffet. Akvavit is a popular alcoholic distilled beverage, and the drinking of snaps is of cultural importance. The traditional flat and dry crisp bread has developed into several contemporary variants. Regionally important foods are the surströmming (a fermented fish) in northern Sweden and eel in southern Sweden. Swedish traditional dishes, some of which are many hundreds of years old, are still an important part of Swedish everyday meals, in spite of the fact that modern-day Swedish cuisine adopts many international dishes. In August, at the traditional feast known as crayfish party, kräftskiva, Swedes eat large amounts of crayfish boiled with dill. Cinema Main article: Cinema of Sweden Swedes have been fairly prominent in the film area through the years. A number of Swedish people have found success in Hollywood, including Ingrid Bergman, Greta Garbo and Max von Sydow. Amongst several directors who have made internationally successful films can be mentioned Ingmar Bergman, Lukas Moodysson and Lasse Hallström. Fashion Interest in fashion is big in Sweden and the country is headquartering famous brands like Hennes & Mauritz (operating as H&M), J. Lindeberg (operating as JL), Acne, Lindex, Odd Molly, Cheap Monday, Gant, WESC, Filippa K, and Nakkna within its borders. These companies, however, are composed largely of buyers who import fashionable goods from throughout Europe and America, continuing the trend of Swedish business toward multinational economic dependency like many of its neighbours. Sports Main article: Sport in Sweden Former World No. 1 tennis player Björn Borg Sport activities are a national movement with half of the population actively participating in organised sporting activities. The two main spectator sports are football and ice hockey. Second to football, horse sports (of which most of the participants are women) have the highest number of practitioners. Thereafter, golf, orienteering, gymnastics, track and field, and the team sports of ice hockey, handball, floorball, basketball and bandy are the most popular in terms of practitioners.[335] The Swedish national men's ice hockey team, affectionately known as Tre Kronor (English: Three Crowns; the national symbol of Sweden), is regarded as one of the best in the world. The team has won the World Championships nine times, placing them third in the all-time medal count. Tre Kronor also won Olympic gold medals in 1994 and 2006. In 2006, Tre Kronor became the first national hockey team to win both the Olympic and world championships in the same year. The Swedish national football team has seen some success at the World Cup in the past, finishing second when they hosted the tournament in 1958, and third twice, in 1950 and 1994. Athletics has enjoyed a surge in popularity due to several successful athletes in recent years, such as Carolina Klüft and Stefan Holm. Sweden hosted the 1912 Summer Olympics, Equestrian at the 1956 Summer Olympics and the FIFA World Cup in 1958. Other big sports events include the UEFA Euro 1992, 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup, 1995 World Championships in Athletics, UEFA Women's Euro 2013, and several championships of ice hockey, curling, athletics, skiing, bandy, figure skating and swimming. Successful football players include Gunnar Nordahl, Gunnar Gren, Nils Liedholm, Henrik Larsson, Freddie Ljungberg, Caroline Seger, Lotta Schelin, Hedvig Lindahl, and Zlatan Ibrahimović. Successful tennis players include former world number 1 players Björn Borg, Mats Wilander and Stefan Edberg. Other famous Swedish athletes include the heavyweight boxing champion and International Boxing Hall of Famer Ingemar Johansson, World Golf Hall of Famer Annika Sörenstam, and multiple World Championships and Olympics medalist in table tennis Jan-Ove Waldner. Due to its northerly latitude numerous world class winter sports athletes have come from Sweden. This includes alpine skiers Ingemar Stenmark, Anja Pärson and Pernilla Wiberg as well as cross country-skiers Gunde Svan, Thomas Wassberg, Charlotte Kalla and Marcus Hellner, all Olympic gold medalists. In 2016, The Swedish Poker Federation (Svepof) has joined The International Federation of Poker (IFP).[336] See also Sweden portal List of Sweden-related topics Outline of Sweden 329 Svea Notes ^ The Monarch and dynastic members of the Royal House must at all times be Protestant Christians of the Church of Sweden, but protestantism has not been the official state religion since the year 2000.[3][4][5] However, the Church is recognized by law[6] and is still supported by the state.[7] ^ The State (Swedish: staten) is also descriptively translated into English as the ""central government"", not to be confused with the Government, i.e. the cabinet which is but one organ of the State. ^ An alternate English translation is ""local governments"".

Though Denmark, where industrialization had begun in the 1850s, was reasonably prosperous by the end of the nineteenth century, both Sweden and Norway were terribly poor. Only the safety valve of mass emigration to America prevented famine and rebellion. At the peak of emigration in the 1880s, over 1% of the total population of both countries emigrated annually. ^ Koblik, Steven (1975). Sweden's Development From Poverty to Affluence, 1750–1970. University of Minnesota Press. pp. 8–9. ISBN 978-0816607662. In economic and social terms the eighteenth century was more a transitional than a revolutionary period. Sweden was, in light of contemporary Western European standards, a relatively poor but stable country. ...It has been estimated that 75–80% of the population was involved in agricultural pursuits during the late eighteenth century. One hundred years later, the corresponding figure was still 72%. ^ Einhorn, Eric and John Logue (1989), p. 8. ^ Ulf Beijbom, ""European emigration"", The House of Emigrants, Växjö, Sweden Archived 3 August 2008 at the Wayback Machine ^ a b Koblik, pp. 9–10. ^ ""Sweden: Social and economic conditions (2007)"".

Mr. Zuckerman, a sociologist who teaches at Pitzer College in Claremont, Calif., has reported his findings on religion in Denmark and Sweden in ""Society Without God"" (New York University Press, 2008). Much that he found will surprise many people, as it did him. The many nonbelievers he interviewed, both informally and in structured, taped and transcribed sessions, were anything but antireligious, for example. They typically balked at the label ""atheist."" An overwhelming majority had in fact been baptized, and many had been confirmed or married in church. Though they denied most of the traditional teachings of Christianity, they called themselves Christians, and most were content to remain in the Danish National Church or the Church of Sweden, the traditional national branches of Lutheranism. ^ a b Herbert, David (2003). Religion and Civil Society: Rethinking Public Religion in the Contemporary World. Ashgate. p. 13. ISBN 978-0-7546-1339-8. More than 80 percent of adults continue to choose to belong to the Lutheran Church in spite of its recent disestablishment and the cost of having to pay the church tax. Rates of baptism remain high and church weddings are increasing. In Sweden, religion appears to play a continuing role in cultural identity, in locating the individual to tradition. ^ ""Getting Better Value for Money from Sweden's Healthcare System | OECD READ edition"".

(February 2017) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) ‹ The template Infobox organization is being considered for merging. › World Business Council for Sustainable DevelopmentFounded1995FounderStephan SchmidheinyFocusSustainable DevelopmentLocationGeneva, SwitzerlandArea served GlobalKey peopleSunny Verghese (Chairman)[1] Peter Bakker (CEO & President)Employees 80Websitewww.wbcsd.org The World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) is a CEO-led organization of over 200 international companies.[2] The Council is also connected to 60 national and regional business councils and partner organizations.[3] Its origins date back to the Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit of 1992,[4] when Stephan Schmidheiny, a Swiss business entrepreneur, was appointed chief adviser for business and industry to the secretary general of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED).[5] He created a forum called ""Business Council for Sustainable Development"", which went on to become Changing Course, a book that coined the concept of eco-efficiency.[6] The WBCSD was created in 1995 as a merger of the Business Council for Sustainable Development and the World Industry Council for the Environment[7] and is based at the Maison de la paix in Geneva, Switzerland,[8] with offices in New York and New Delhi. Contents 1 Operations 2 Impact and influence 3 Membership 3.1 Forética 4 Governance 5 Geographic balance 6 Controversies 7 References 8 External links Operations[edit] The Council works on a variety of issues related to sustainable development. It works to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through the transformation of six economic systems. These are circular economy,[9] Cities and Mobility,[10] Climate and Energy,[11] Food, Land and Water,[12] People[13] and Redefining Value.[14] Each system transformation is set up as a WBCSD Program with a number of supplementary Projects.[15] Impact and influence[edit] A 2003 World Bank/IFC commissioned study identified the WBCSD as one of the ""most influential forums"" for companies on corporate social responsibility (CSR) issues.[16] A 2004 Globescan survey found the WBCSD as the second most effective SD research organization.[17] The 2006 survey by the same company reports that 54% of all surveyed experts believe the WBCSD will play a ""major role"" in advancing sustainable development. Only the European Union received higher approval (69%).[18] In the 2007's Ethisphere Institute list of the 100 Most Influential People in Business Ethics, WBCSD President Bjoern Stigson has been ranked ninth, which made him the second most influential NGO leader.[19] Membership[edit] Membership of the WBCSD is by invitation of the Executive Committee to companies committed to sustainable development. Among its over 180 members[20] are well-known companies such as DuPont, 3M, Nestlé, BP, Danone and Royal Dutch Shell. WBCSD provides its members with the value, impact and voice to navigate unprecedented global changes and allows them to prosper from transforming their operations. By joining the WBCSD, member companies benefit from insights into the latest knowledge on sustainability, sustainability tools, peer collaboration across the value chain, participation in policy development and a chance to profile their sustainability work.[20] Member companies pledge their support and contribution to the WBCSD by making available their knowledge and experience, and appropriate human resources. They are asked to publicly report on their environmental performance and to aspire to widen their reporting to cover all three pillars of sustainable development – economic, social and environmental. A key element is the personal commitment of the Chief Executive Officers (CEOs), acting as Council Members. They are influential advocates for the WBCSD's policy positions and they co-chair the working groups. They also organize support for the WBCSD's work program and ensure the adoption of sustainable management practices within their companies. Forética[edit] Forética claims to be global network of Spanish speaking businesses and professionals whose mission is to promote an ethical management and corporate social responsibility by the establishment of a National standard in Spain known as SGE-21, (sistema de gestación ética para siglo 21) which is also Annex 1 to ISO 26000 and supported by CSR Europe[21] Membership is said to around 400 and includes companies of all sizes and sectors, as well as individual specialists, professionals and academics and it was incorporated into WBCSD on 2 September 2014.[22] Governance[edit] The WBCSD is a member-led organization governed by a Council composed of the Council Members of its member companies. The Council elects the Executive Committee, including the Chairman and four Vice Chairmen. Past chairmen include: Rodney F. Chase – BP (1995) Livio D. DeSimone – 3M (1996/97) Egil Myklebust – Norsk Hydro (1998/99) Charles O. Holliday, Jr. – DuPont (2000/01) Sir Philip Watts KCMG – Royal Dutch Shell (2002/03) Bertrand Collomb – Lafarge (2004/05) Travis Engen – Alcan (2006/07) Sam DiPiazza – PwC (2008/09) Paul Polman – Unilever (2012–17) Sunny Verghese – Olam (2018–2020) Geographic balance[edit] Most of WBCSD's member companies are headquartered in Europe (47%). 22% member companies are headquartered in Asia, 22% in North America and 5% in Latin America. The geographically least represented regions are Africa, Australasia and the Middle East with 1% each.[20] Controversies[edit] According to Greenpeace the World Business Council for Sustainable Development is among the key players responsible for holding the world societies from tackling the climate change and energy management challenges for the past 20 years. The WBCSD Executive Committee was dominated by the largest non-renewable energy and carbon-intensive companies in the world at least until 2011. According to Greenpeace the WBCSD executive committee has been a 'Who's Who' of the world's largest carbon-intensive companies.[23] The Sierra Club has collaborated with the World Business Council on a number of initiatives, as well as inviting its representatives to speak at Sierra Club events.[24][25] The Environmental Defense Fund recommends the World Business Council's auditing methods to companies seeking to reduce greenhouse emissions,[26] and the Natural Resources Defense Council has drawn upon WBCSD guidelines in drawing up their own guidelines for determining biofuels sustainability.[27] The WBCSD's Vision 2050 report was highlighted by The Guardian as ""the largest concerted corporate sustainability action plan to date – include reversing the damage done to ecosystems, addressing rising greenhouse gas emissions and ensuring societies move to sustainable agriculture.""[28] References[edit] ^ ""Sunny Verghese appointed as WBCSD Chair from 2018"".

174,"Stephan Schmidheiny - Wikipedia Stephan Schmidheiny From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Stephan Schmidheiny (1992) Stephan Ernst Schmidheiny (born 29 October 1947) is a Swiss entrepreneur, philanthropist and advocate of sustainable development[citation needed]. In 2019, his net worth was estimated by Forbes to be $2.3 billion.[1] He's also well known for being convicted over his role in the Italian asbestos scandal. [2] Contents 1 Life 2 Career 2.1 Eternit / Exit from Asbestos, Reflection and Legal Disputes 2.2 Sentenced for Involuntary Manslaughter 2.3 Other engagements 3 Philanthropy 3.1 Rio Summit 1992 3.2 AVINA Foundation 3.3 Other philanthropy 4 Awards 5 References 6 External links Life[edit] Stephan Ernest Schmidheiny was born in Balgach, St. Gallen, Switzerland, on 29 October 1947 as a fourth generation member of one of the key industrial families in Switzerland and completed his Law studies with a doctorate at the University of Zurich in 1972.[citation needed] From 1974 until 2002, Stephan Schmidheiny was married to Ruth Schmidheiny (Administrator of the Daros Latinamerica AG from 1974 until 2002). He has a son and a daughter with Ruth and currently lives in Hurden, Switzerland. Since 2012, he has been married to Dr. Viktoria Schmidheiny-Werner.[citation needed] Schmidheiny is an advocate and leader in the field of sustainable development.[citation needed] Career[edit] Eternit / Exit from Asbestos, Reflection and Legal Disputes[edit] In 1972, Stephan Schmidheiny started his business career at Eternit. In 1976, at the age of 29, he was named CEO of the Swiss Eternit Group. According to his brother Thomas Schmidheiny, their father Max Schmidheiny decided to divide his industrial empire into two halves: asbestos for Stephan, cement for Thomas.[3] As a result of this split of activities, Stephan Schmidheiny inherited Eternit. According to his official biography,[4] he ended the company's use of asbestos in 1986. Five years before in 1981, Schmidheiny, then Chairman, announced Eternit's intention to dispense entirely with its involvement in asbestos production and distribution, far ahead of the 2005 European-wide asbestos ban. Subsequently, Eternit worked to develop and fund research to develop new fiber blends to replace asbestos. In 1984, a majority of Eternit products were manufactured asbestos free. Since 2009, due to his involvement in his family's industrial dynasty and despite his efforts to exit from asbestos, Stephan Schmidheiny has been involved in trials in Italy, one for environmental disaster and another for voluntary manslaughter, both connected to the employ of asbestos in the factories of Eternit.[3] In the first trial Stephan Schmidheiny was sentenced to 16 years imprisonment on February 13, 2012.[5] On June 3, 2013, the judgment given in February was not only confirmed, but also increased to 18 years imprisonment for environmental damage by the Turin Appeal Court,[6] In November 2014, it was ruled that the statute of limitations had passed.[7][8] In 2014, Schmidheiny was acquitted of the charges for alleged negligent behavior in Italy. In 2015, a second trial called ""Eternit Bis"" began,[9] Stephan Schmidheiny defended against the accusation of voluntary manslaughter. On November 29, 2016 the allegations raised in Eternit Bis were dismissed by the court in Turin and the case closed. Some legal proceedings regarding negligent homicide are still possible, e.g. in Vercelli, Reggio Emilia, Naples as well as in Turin [10] Schmidheiny has emphasized that his involvement with the Eternit group was long before the health risks of asbestos were understood, and long before production was prohibited in Italy; this ban did not happen until 1992. He admitted in an interview in 2015[11] that the strain from the legal proceedings in Italy had deeply affected him. Later, however, he felt the proceedings had become absurd, especially after an Italian judge compared him to Hitler and his actions comparable with “the final solution”. Beyond the aforementioned legal proceedings, Stephan Schmidheiny set up funds for victims of asbestos-related diseases in South Africa and Italy, as these countries had no successor company to Eternit, which could bear the financial consequences of asbestos exposure.[12] Sentenced for Involuntary Manslaughter[edit] In May 2019, Stephan Schmidheiny, the former majority shareholder in Italian asbestos company Eternit Genova, has been sentenced to four years in prison by a Turin court for the death of two workers.[13] The ruling marks the latest twist in a decade-long battle between Schmidheiny, the Italian government, former Eternit workers and residents of towns near the company’s asbestos plants. Prosecutor Gianfranco Colace said the ruling was the “first step” in setting a precedent on deaths from cancer and pulmonary diseases, which can take years to develop after contact with asbestos fibers.[14] Other engagements[edit] While Schmidheiny withdrew from asbestos production and Eternit, he invested in new industrial segments, building up a multinational conglomerate of shareholdings by adding enterprises in the areas of forestry, banking, consumer goods, power generation, as well as electronic and optical equipment. He also joined the boards of directors of leading companies such as ABB Asea Brown Boveri, Nestlé, Swatch, and UBS AG. In 1985 Schmidheiny supported Nicolas Hayek in his bid for the Swiss watch holding company Société de Microélectronique et d'Horlogerie(SMH), which resulted in the rescue of the Swiss watch industry. Later from this valuable alliance, the present day Swatch Group was formed.[15] In 1987, as an anchor shareholder in Brown, Boveri & Cie (BBC), Schmidheiny co-organized a merger of BBC with ASEA of Sweden. This led to the creation of the newly positioned, market leader in its segment, ASEA Brown Boveri, today known as ABB Group.[citation needed] In 1987, he took over two-thirds of the capital of Landis + Gyr from the family shareholders, as they could provide no successor for leadership. In doing so, Schmidheiny was aware that major changes were necessary, as the company was not doing well. Schmidheiny restructured the company. In 1995, the company was taken over by the Swiss company Elektrowatt.[citation needed] Philanthropy[edit] Philanthropic pursuits have been important to Schmidheiny and since the 1990s, he has devoted his life to these pursuits. Schmidheiny is an advocate and leader in the field of sustainable development. He served as adviser on sustainability to the United Nations as well as to the OECD.[16][17] In the 1980s he created FUNDES,[18] an organization that supports the development of small and medium-sized enterprises in several Latin American countries. According to recent Swiss accounts, Schmidheiny began buying Chilean forest land in 1982, and he now owns over 120,000 hectares in Southern Chile, near Concepción, land which the Mapuche Indians claim has been theirs since time immemorial. The Mapuche charge that some of the land Schmidheiny bought was stolen from them during the Pinochet dictatorship, using that regime's standard techniques of intimidation, torture, and murder.[19] In 2019 Forbes put Schmidheiny in the list of the world's most generous philanthropists outside of the US.[20] Rio Summit 1992[edit] In 1990 Schmidheiny was appointed chief adviser for business and industry to the secretary general of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), better known as the Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit of 1992. The conference took place in 1992, with 172 governments participating. As chief advisor to this conference, Schmidheiny created a forum in which leading businessmen from all parts of the world developed a business perspective on environment and development challenges. This forum later became the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), an organization that today counts the world's 160 most important companies as its members. Schmidheiny was elected honorary chairman, in recognition of his pioneering role in the phase-out of production of building materials containing asbestos. Following his involvement in the Rio Summit, Schmidheiny authored the book Change of Course: Global Business Prospects for Development and the Environment,[21] published by MIT Press in 1992. His book offers an extensive analysis of how businesses can make sustainable development their focus, his book has been translated into fifteen languages.[22] He also contributed to Financing Change: The Financial Community, Eco-efficiency, and Sustainable Development [23] also published by MIT Press. AVINA Foundation[edit] In the 1990s Schmidheiny established the Fundación AVINA ,[24] which contributes to sustainable development in Latin America by encouraging productive alliances among social and business leaders and today is a leading player in that field. Schmidheiny's foundation pioneered a South American microfinance system similar to that of Muhammad Yunus whose widely praised system benefits the citizens of Bangladesh. Stephan Schmidheiny's charitable activities in South America have meant a donation of over one billion US dollars to the region.[25] After the creation of VIVA Trust in 2003, Schmidheiny retired from all of his executive functions, including his positions in GrupoNueva [26] and AVINA. Other philanthropy[edit] In 1993, Schmidheiny in memory of his late brother Alexander, who died in 1992, founded the Alexander Schmidheiny Foundation [27] with the inheritance from his brother's estate. This Foundation is active in the St. Gallen Rhine Valley.[citation needed] Schmidheiny supports arts and culture through a series of initiatives. He has developed and expanded the art collection of his deceased brother Alexander, the Daros Collection. The Daros Collection, based in Zurich is a substantial collection of North American and European art from the second half of the 20th century.[28] Stephan is a contributor to the Zurich Chamber Orchestra and other important cultural institutions.[citation needed] In Gstaad, he and his wife Victoria are seeking to build a new cultural center called Les Arts Gstaad.[29] On Schmidheiny's website[30] is possible to find a specific section about his ""philanthropic activities"" and another about his engagement for ""ecological efficience"".[citation needed] According to information from Fundacion MarViva, Schmidheiny has played a foundational role in starting this organization that bridges scientific research with public activism for the promotion of marine habitat near and in the Costa Rica Thermal Dome, with an organizational presence in Costa Rica, Panama, and Columbia.[31] Awards[edit] Schmidheiny has received a large number of prizes and awards in recognition of his leadership and his contribution to sustainable development.[citation needed] These include a 1993 honorary doctorate from the Instituto Centroamerica de Administración de Empresas (INCAE), Costa Rica [32] and the same honorary doctorate in 1996 by Yale University.[33] and in 2001 by Rollins College,[34] Florida, and the Andrés Bello Catholic University (UCAB), Caracas.[35] In 2001, Schmidheiny received the Zayed International Prize for the Environment for ""Environmental Action Leading to Positive Change in Society"".[36] In 2007, during the PODER Green Forum, Schmidheiny was awarded a Philanthropy Award.[37] References[edit] ^ ""Stephan Schmidheiny"".

Contents 1 Operations 2 Impact and influence 3 Membership 3.1 Forética 4 Governance 5 Geographic balance 6 Controversies 7 References 8 External links Operations[edit] The Council works on a variety of issues related to sustainable development. It works to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through the transformation of six economic systems. These are circular economy,[9] Cities and Mobility,[10] Climate and Energy,[11] Food, Land and Water,[12] People[13] and Redefining Value.[14] Each system transformation is set up as a WBCSD Program with a number of supplementary Projects.[15] Impact and influence[edit] A 2003 World Bank/IFC commissioned study identified the WBCSD as one of the ""most influential forums"" for companies on corporate social responsibility (CSR) issues.[16] A 2004 Globescan survey found the WBCSD as the second most effective SD research organization.[17] The 2006 survey by the same company reports that 54% of all surveyed experts believe the WBCSD will play a ""major role"" in advancing sustainable development. Only the European Union received higher approval (69%).[18] In the 2007's Ethisphere Institute list of the 100 Most Influential People in Business Ethics, WBCSD President Bjoern Stigson has been ranked ninth, which made him the second most influential NGO leader.[19] Membership[edit] Membership of the WBCSD is by invitation of the Executive Committee to companies committed to sustainable development. Among its over 180 members[20] are well-known companies such as DuPont, 3M, Nestlé, BP, Danone and Royal Dutch Shell. WBCSD provides its members with the value, impact and voice to navigate unprecedented global changes and allows them to prosper from transforming their operations. By joining the WBCSD, member companies benefit from insights into the latest knowledge on sustainability, sustainability tools, peer collaboration across the value chain, participation in policy development and a chance to profile their sustainability work.[20] Member companies pledge their support and contribution to the WBCSD by making available their knowledge and experience, and appropriate human resources. They are asked to publicly report on their environmental performance and to aspire to widen their reporting to cover all three pillars of sustainable development – economic, social and environmental. A key element is the personal commitment of the Chief Executive Officers (CEOs), acting as Council Members. They are influential advocates for the WBCSD's policy positions and they co-chair the working groups. They also organize support for the WBCSD's work program and ensure the adoption of sustainable management practices within their companies. Forética[edit] Forética claims to be global network of Spanish speaking businesses and professionals whose mission is to promote an ethical management and corporate social responsibility by the establishment of a National standard in Spain known as SGE-21, (sistema de gestación ética para siglo 21) which is also Annex 1 to ISO 26000 and supported by CSR Europe[21] Membership is said to around 400 and includes companies of all sizes and sectors, as well as individual specialists, professionals and academics and it was incorporated into WBCSD on 2 September 2014.[22] Governance[edit] The WBCSD is a member-led organization governed by a Council composed of the Council Members of its member companies. The Council elects the Executive Committee, including the Chairman and four Vice Chairmen. Past chairmen include: Rodney F. Chase – BP (1995) Livio D.

The geographically least represented regions are Africa, Australasia and the Middle East with 1% each.[20] Controversies[edit] According to Greenpeace the World Business Council for Sustainable Development is among the key players responsible for holding the world societies from tackling the climate change and energy management challenges for the past 20 years. The WBCSD Executive Committee was dominated by the largest non-renewable energy and carbon-intensive companies in the world at least until 2011. According to Greenpeace the WBCSD executive committee has been a 'Who's Who' of the world's largest carbon-intensive companies.[23] The Sierra Club has collaborated with the World Business Council on a number of initiatives, as well as inviting its representatives to speak at Sierra Club events.[24][25] The Environmental Defense Fund recommends the World Business Council's auditing methods to companies seeking to reduce greenhouse emissions,[26] and the Natural Resources Defense Council has drawn upon WBCSD guidelines in drawing up their own guidelines for determining biofuels sustainability.[27] The WBCSD's Vision 2050 report was highlighted by The Guardian as ""the largest concerted corporate sustainability action plan to date – include reversing the damage done to ecosystems, addressing rising greenhouse gas emissions and ensuring societies move to sustainable agriculture.""[28] References[edit] ^ ""Sunny Verghese appointed as WBCSD Chair from 2018"".

Situated where the Rhône exits Lake Geneva, it is the capital of the Republic and Canton of Geneva. The municipality (ville de Genève) has a population (as of December 2019[update]) of 203,951, and the canton (essentially the city and its inner-ring suburbs) has 504,128 residents.[5] In 2014, the compact agglomération du Grand Genève had 946,000 inhabitants in 212 communities in both Switzerland and France.[6] Within Swiss territory, the commuter area named ""Métropole lémanique"" contains a population of 1.26 million.[7][8] This area is essentially spread east from Geneva towards the Riviera area (Vevey, Montreux) and north-east towards Yverdon-les-Bains, in the neighbouring canton of Vaud. Geneva is a global city, a financial centre, and a worldwide centre for diplomacy due to the presence of numerous international organizations, including the headquarters of many agencies of the United Nations[9] and the Red Cross.[10] Geneva hosts the highest number of international organizations in the world.[11] It is also where the Geneva Conventions were signed, which chiefly concern the treatment of wartime non-combatants and prisoners of war. Together with, for instance, New York City (global headquarters of the UN), Basel (Bank for International Settlements), and Strasbourg (Council of Europe), Geneva is a city serving as the headquarters of one of the most important international organizations, without being the capital of a country.[12][13][14] In 2021, Geneva was ranked as the world's ninth most important financial centre for competitiveness by the Global Financial Centres Index, fifth in Europe behind London, Zürich, Frankfurt and Luxembourg.[15] In 2019, Geneva was ranked among the ten most liveable cities in the world by Mercer together with Zürich and Basel.[16] The city has been referred to as the world's most compact metropolis[17] and the ""Peace Capital"".[18] In 2019, Mercer ranked Geneva as the thirteenth most expensive city in the world.[19] In a UBS ranking of global cities in 2018, Geneva was ranked first for gross earnings, second most expensive, and fourth in purchasing power.[20] Contents 1 Name 2 History 3 Geography 3.1 Topography 3.2 Climate 4 Politics 4.1 Coat of arms 4.2 Administrative divisions 4.3 Government 4.4 Parliament 4.5 Elections 4.5.1 National Council 4.6 International relations 5 Demographics 5.1 Population 5.2 Historical population 5.3 Religion 5.3.1 ""Protestant Rome"" 5.4 Crime 6 Cityscape 7 Heritage sites of national significance 8 Society and culture 8.1 Media 8.2 Traditions and customs 8.3 Music and festivals 9 Education 10 Economy 11 Sport 12 Infrastructure 12.1 Transportation 12.2 Utilities 13 International organisations 14 Notable people 14.1 A–C 14.2 D–G 14.3 H–M 14.4 N-R 14.5 S–Z 15 See also 16 Notes and references 17 Bibliography 18 External links Name[edit] The city was mentioned in Latin texts, by Caesar, with the spelling Genava,[21] probably from the Celtic *genawa- from the stem *genu- (""bend, knee""), in the sense of a bending river or estuary, an etymology shared with the Italian port city of Genoa (in Italian Genova).[22] The medieval county of Geneva in Middle Latin was known as pagus major Genevensis or Comitatus Genevensis (also Gebennensis). After 1400 it became the Genevois province of Savoy (albeit not extending to the city proper, until the reformation of the seat of the Bishop of Geneva).[23] History[edit] Main articles: History of Geneva and Timeline of Geneva For the Catholic ecclesiastical history, see bishopric of Geneva. A view of Geneva by Frances Elizabeth Wynne, 4 August 1858 L'Escalade is what Genevans call the failed surprise attack of 12 December 1602 by troops sent by Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy, to take Geneva. This imaginative image was drawn by Matthias Quad, or the workshop of Frans Hogenberg, around 1603. Invaders are pictured crossing the moat in the center left while reinforcements are entering Plainpalais at the bottom. A column of defenders is in the center, headed toward the Savoyards. Lake Léman is at center top. Geneva was an Allobrogian border town, fortified against the Helvetii tribe,[24] when the Romans took it in 121 BC. It became Christian under the Late Roman Empire, and acquired its first bishop in the 5th century, having been connected to the Bishopric of Vienne in the 4th. Aerial view (1966) In the Middle Ages, Geneva was ruled by a count under the Holy Roman Empire until the late 14th century, when it was granted a charter giving it a high degree of self-governance. Around this time, the House of Savoy came to at least nominally dominate the city. In the 15th century, an oligarchic republican government emerged with the creation of the Grand Council. In the first half of the 16th century, the Protestant Reformation reached the city, causing religious strife, during which Savoy rule was thrown off and Geneva allied itself with the Swiss Confederacy. In 1541, with Protestantism on the rise, John Calvin, the Protestant Reformer and proponent of Calvinism, became the spiritual leader of the city and established the Republic of Geneva. By the 18th century, Geneva had come under the influence of Catholic France, which cultivated the city as its own. France tended to be at odds with the ordinary townsfolk, which inspired the failed Geneva Revolution of 1782, an attempt to win representation in the government for men of modest means. In 1798, revolutionary France under the Directory annexed Geneva. At the end of the Napoleonic Wars, on 1 June 1814, Geneva was admitted to the Swiss Confederation. In 1907, the separation of Church and State was adopted. Geneva flourished in the 19th and 20th centuries, becoming the seat of many international organizations.[25] Geography[edit] Topography[edit] Satellite view of Geneva; Cointrin Airport is centre left. Geneva is located at 46°12' North, 6°09' East, at the south-western end of Lake Geneva, where the Rhône flows out. It is surrounded by three mountain chains, each belonging to the Jura: the Jura main range lies north-westward, the Vuache southward, and the Salève south-eastward. The Geneva area seen from the Salève in France. The Jura mountains are on the horizon. The city covers an area of 15.93 km2 (6.2 sq mi), while the area of the canton is 282 km2 (108.9 sq mi), including the two small exclaves of Céligny in Vaud. The part of the lake that is attached to Geneva has an area of 38 km2 (14.7 sq mi) and is sometimes referred to as petit lac (small lake). The canton has only a 4.5-kilometre-long (2.8 mi) border with the rest of Switzerland. Of 107.5 km (66.8 mi) of border, 103 are shared with France, the Département de l'Ain to the north and west and the Département de la Haute-Savoie to the south and east. Of the land in the city, 0.24 km2 (0.093 sq mi), or 1.5%, is used for agricultural purposes, while 0.5 km2 (0.19 sq mi), or 3.1%, is forested. The rest of the land, 14.63 km2 (5.65 sq mi), or 91.8%, is built up (buildings or roads), 0.49 km2 (0.19 sq mi), or 3.1%, is either rivers or lakes and 0.02 km2 (4.9 acres), or 0.1%, is wasteland.[26] Of the built up area, industrial buildings made up 3.4%, housing and buildings made up 46.2% and transportation infrastructure 25.8%, while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 15.7%. Of the agricultural land, 0.3% is used for growing crops. Of the water in the municipality, 0.2% is composed of lakes and 2.9% is rivers and streams.[26] Confluence of the Rhône and the Arve The altitude of Geneva is 373.6 metres (1,225.7 ft) and corresponds to the altitude of the largest of the Pierres du Niton, two large rocks emerging from the lake which date from the last ice age. This rock was chosen by General Guillaume Henri Dufour as the reference point for surveying in Switzerland.[27] The second main river of Geneva is the Arve, which flows into the Rhône just west of the city centre. Mont Blanc can be seen from Geneva and is an hour's drive from the city. Climate[edit] Average temperature and precipitation 1961–1990[28] The climate of Geneva is a temperate climate, more specifically an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification: Cfb). Winters are cool, usually with light frosts at night and thawing conditions during the day. Summers are relatively warm. Precipitation is adequate and is relatively well-distributed throughout the year, although autumn is slightly wetter than other seasons. Ice storms near Lac Léman are normal in the winter: Geneva can be affected by the Bise, a north-easterly wind. This can lead to severe icing in winter.[29] In summer, many people swim in the lake and patronise public beaches such as Genève Plage and the Bains des Pâquis. The city, in certain years, receives snow during colder months. The nearby mountains are subject to substantial snowfall and are suitable for skiing. Many world-renowned ski resorts such as Verbier and Crans-Montana are less than three hours away by car. Mont Salève (1,379 m (4,524 ft)), just across the border in France, dominates the southerly view from the city centre, and Mont Blanc, the highest of the Alpine range, is visible from most of the city, towering high above Chamonix, which, along with Morzine, Le Grand Bornand, La Clusaz, and resorts of the Grand Massif such as Samoens, Morillon, and Flaine, are the closest French skiing destinations to Geneva. During the years 2000–2009, the mean yearly temperature was 11 °C and the mean number of sunshine-hours per year was 2003.[30] The highest temperature recorded in Genève–Cointrin was 39.7 °C (103.5 °F) in July 2015, and the lowest temperature recorded was −20.0 °C (−4.0 °F) in February 1956.

The right bank includes: (1) Saint-Jean and Charmilles; (2) Servette and Petit-Saconnex; (3) Grottes and Saint-Gervais; and (4) Paquis and Nations.[35] Government[edit] See also: List of mayors of Geneva Logo of the city of Geneva, 2004 The Administrative Council (Conseil administratif) constitutes the executive government of the city of Geneva and operates as a collegiate authority. It is composed of five councilors (French: Conseiller administratif/ Conseillère administrative), each presiding over a department. The president of the executive department acts as mayor (la maire/le maire). In the governmental year 2021–2022, the Administrative Council is presided over by Madame la maire de Genève Frédérique Perler. Departmental tasks, coordination measures and implementation of laws decreed by the Municipal Council are carried out by the Administrative Council. Elections for the Administrative Council are held every five years. The current term of (la législature) is from 1 June 2020 to 31 May 2025. The delegates are elected by means of a system of Majorz. The mayor and vice change each year, while the heads of the other departments are assigned by the collegiate. The executive body holds its meetings in the Palais Eynard, near the Parc des Bastions.[36] As of 2020[update], Geneva's Administrative Council is made up of two representatives each of the Social Democratic Party (PS) and the Green Party (PES), and one member of the Christian Democratic Party (PDC). This gives the left-wing parties four out of the five seats and, for the first time in history, a female majority. The last election was held on 15 March/5 April 2020.[37] Except for the mayor, all other councillors have been elected for the first time.[38] Le Conseil administratif of Geneva [38] Councillor(M. Conseiller administratif/ Mme Conseillère administrative) Party Head of Office (Département, since) of elected in Frédérique Perler[SR 1] PES Planning, Construction, and Mobility (de l'aménagement, des constructions et de la mobilité, 2020) 2020 Marie Barbey-Chappuisat[SR 2] PDC Security and Sport (de la sécurité et des sports, 2020) 2020 Sami Kanaan PS Culture and Digital Change (de la culture et de la transition numérique, 2020) 2011 Alfonso Gomez PES Finance, Environment and Housing (des finances, de l'environnement et du logement, 2020) 2020 Christina Kitsos PS Social Cohesion and Solidarity (de la cohésion sociale et de la solidarité, 2020) 2020 ^ Mayor (la maire de Genève) 2021/22 ^ Vice President (Vice-présidente) 2021/22 Parliament[edit] Le Conseil municipal of Geneva for the mandate period of 2020–2025 Ensemble à gauche (PST-POP & Sol) (8.8%)  PS (23.8%)  Les Verts (PES) (22.5%)  PDC (10%)  PLR (17.5%)  UDC (8.8%)  MCG (8.8%) The Municipal Council (Conseil municipal) holds legislative power. It is made up of 80 members, with elections held every five years. The Municipal Council makes regulations and by-laws that are executed by the Administrative Council and the administration. The delegates are selected by means of a system of proportional representation with a seven percent threshold. The sessions of the Municipal Council are public. Unlike members of the Administrative Council, members of the Municipal Council are not politicians by profession, and they are paid a fee based on their attendance. Any resident of Geneva allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the Municipal Council. The Council holds its meetings in the Town Hall (Hôtel de Ville), in the old city.[39] The last election of the Municipal Council was held on 15 March 2020 for the (législature) of 2020–2025. Currently, the Municipal Council consists of: 19 members of the Social Democratic Party (PS), 18 Green Party (PES), 14 Les Libéraux-Radicaux (PLR), 8 Christian Democratic People's Party (PDC); 7 Geneva Citizens' Movement (MCG,), 7 Ensemble à Gauche (an alliance of the left parties PST-POP (Parti Suisse du Travail – Parti Ouvrier et Populaire) and solidaritéS), 6 Swiss People's Party (UDC).[40] Elections[edit] National Council[edit] In the 2019 federal election for the Swiss National Council the most popular party was the Green Party which received 26% (+14.6) of the vote. The next seven most popular parties were the PS (17.9%, -5.9), PLR (15.1%, -2.4), the UDC (12.6%, -3.7), the PdA/solidaritéS (10%, +1.3), the PDC (5.4%, -5.3), the pvl (5%, +2.9), and MCR (4.9%, -2.7).[41] In the federal election a total of 34,319 votes were cast, and the voter turnout was 39.6%.[42] In the 2015 federal election for the Swiss National Council the most popular party was the PS which received 23.8% of the vote. The next five most popular parties were the PLR (17.6%), the UDC (16.3%), the Green Party (11.4%), the PDC (10.7%), and the solidaritéS (8.8%). In the federal election a total of 36,490 votes were cast, and the voter turnout was 44.1%.[43] International relations[edit] Geneva does not have any sister relationships with other cities. It declares itself related to the entire world.[44][45] Demographics[edit] Population[edit] The Flowered Clock at the Quai du Général-Guisan (English Garden), during the 2012 Geneva Festival Rue Pierre-Fatio in Geneva Geneva has a population (as of December 2019[update]) of 203,951.[5] The city of Geneva is at the centre of the Geneva metropolitan area, known as Grand Genève in French (Greater Geneva). Greater Geneva includes the Canton of Geneva, the District of Nyon in the Canton of Vaud and several areas in the French departments of Haute-Savoie and Ain. In 2011, the agglomération franco-valdo-genevoise had 915,000 inhabitants, two-thirds of whom lived on Swiss soil and one-third on French soil.[46] The Geneva metropolitan area is experiencing steady demographic growth of 1.2% a year and the population of the agglomération franco-valdo-genevoise is expected to reach a total of one million people in the near future.[46] The official language of Geneva (both the city and the canton) is French. English is also common due to the high number of anglophone expatriates and foreigners working in international institutions and in the bank sector. As of 2000[update], 128,622 or 72.3% of the population speaks French as a first language, with English being the second most common (7,853 or 4.4%) language. 7,462 inhabitants speak Spanish (or 4.2%), 7,320 speak Italian (4.1%), 7,050 speak German (4.0%) and 113 people who speak Romansh.[47] As a result of immigration flows in the 1960s and 1980s, Portuguese is also spoken by a considerable proportion of the population. In the city of Geneva, as of 2013[update], 48% of the population are resident foreign nationals.[48] For a list of the largest groups of foreign residents see the cantonal overview. Over the last 10 years (1999–2009), the population has changed at a rate of 7.2%; a rate of 3.4% due to migration and at a rate of 3.4% due to births and deaths.[49] As of 2008[update], the gender distribution of the population was 47.8% male and 52.2% female. The population was made up of 46,284 Swiss men (24.2% of the population) and 45,127 (23.6%) non-Swiss men. There were 56,091 Swiss women (29.3%) and 43,735 (22.9%) non-Swiss women.[50] As of 2000[update] approximately 24.3% of the population of the municipality were born in Geneva and lived there in 2000 – 43,296. A further 11,757 or 6.6% who were born in the same canton, while 27,359 or 15.4% were born elsewhere in Switzerland, and 77,893 or 43.8% were born outside of Switzerland.[47] In 2008[update], there were 1,147 live births to Swiss citizens and 893 births to non-Swiss citizens, and in the same time span there were 1,114 deaths of Swiss citizens and 274 non-Swiss citizen deaths. Ignoring immigration and emigration, the population of Swiss citizens increased by 33, while the foreign population increased by 619. There were 465 Swiss men and 498 Swiss women who emigrated from Switzerland. At the same time, there were 2933 non-Swiss men and 2662 non-Swiss women who immigrated from another country to Switzerland. The total Swiss population change in 2008 (from all sources, including moves across municipal borders) was an increase of 135 and the non-Swiss population increased by 3181 people. This represents a population growth rate of 1.8%.[51] As of 2000[update], children and teenagers (0–19 years old) make up 18.2% of the population, while adults (20–64 years old) make up 65.8% and seniors (over 64 years old) make up 16%.[49] As of 2000[update], there were 78,666 people who were single and never married in the municipality. There were 74,205 married individuals, 10,006 widows or widowers and 15,087 individuals who are divorced.[47] As of 2000[update], there were 86,231 private households in the municipality, and an average of 1.9 persons per household.[49] There were 44,373 households that consist of only one person and 2,549 households with five or more people. Out of a total of 89,269 households that answered this question, 49.7% were households made up of just one person and there were 471 adults who lived with their parents. Of the rest of the households, there are 17,429 married couples without children, 16,607 married couples with children. There were 5,499 single parents with a child or children. There were 1,852 households that were made up of unrelated people and 3,038 households that were made up of some sort of institution or another collective housing.[47] Apartment buildings in the Quartier des Grottes Geneva, with Lake Geneva in the background In 2000[update], there were 743 single family homes (or 10.6% of the total) out of a total of 6,990 inhabited buildings. There were 2,758 multi-family buildings (39.5%), along with 2,886 multi-purpose buildings that were mostly used for housing (41.3%) and 603 other use buildings (commercial or industrial) that also had some housing (8.6%). Of the single family homes, 197 were built before 1919, while 20 were built between 1990 and 2000. The greatest number of single family homes (277) were built between 1919 and 1945.[52] In 2000[update], there were 101,794 apartments in the municipality. The most common apartment size was 3 rooms of which there were 27,084. There were 21,889 single room apartments and 11,166 apartments with five or more rooms. Of these apartments, a total of 85,330 apartments (83.8% of the total) were permanently occupied, while 13,644 apartments (13.4%) were seasonally occupied and 2,820 apartments (2.8%) were empty.[52] As of 2009[update], the construction rate of new housing units was 1.3 new units per 1000 residents.[49] As of 2003[update], the average price to rent an average apartment in Geneva was 1163.30 Swiss francs (CHF) per month (US$930, £520, €740 approx. exchange rate from 2003). The average rate for a one-room apartment was 641.60 CHF (US$510, £290, €410), a two-room apartment was about 874.46 CHF (US$700, £390, €560), a three-room apartment was about 1126.37 CHF (US$900, £510, €720) and a six or more room apartment cost an average of 2691.07 CHF (US$2150, £1210, €1720). The average apartment price in Geneva was 104.2% of the national average of 1116 CHF.[53] The vacancy rate for the municipality, in 2010[update], was 0.25%.[49] In June 2011, the average price of an apartment in and around Geneva was 13,681 CHF per square metre (11 square feet). The average can be as high as 17,589 Swiss francs (CHF) per square metre (11 square feet) for a luxury apartment and as low as 9,847 Swiss francs (CHF) for an older or basic apartment. For houses in and around Geneva, the average price was 11,595 Swiss francs (CHF) per square metre (11 square feet) (June 2011), with a lowest price per square metre (11 square feet) of 4,874 Swiss francs (CHF), and a maximum price of 21,966 Swiss francs (CHF).[54] Historical population[edit] William Monter calculates that the city's total population was 12,000–13,000 in 1550, doubling to over 25,000 by 1560.[55] The historical population is given in the following chart:[56] Historic population data[56] Year Total population German-speaking French-speaking Catholic Protestant Other Jewish Islamic No religion given Swiss Non-Swiss 1850 37,724 11,123 26,446 29,203 8,521 1870 60,004 27,092 35,064 39,012 24,507 1888 75,709 10,806 61,429 32,168 41,605 1,330 654 47,482 28,227 1900 97,359 11,703 77,611 44,958 49,875 1,918 1,055 58,376 38,983 1910 115,243 14,566 86,697 53,248 55,474 4,267 2,170 67,430 47,813 1930 124,121 18,717 93,058 49,531 66,016 4,584 2,224 92,693 31,428 1950 145,473 20,603 111,314 58,556 74,837 6,164 2,642 118,863 26,610 1970 173,618 19,657 111,553 90,555 65,393 22,591 3,128 959 6,164 115,107 58,511 1990 171,042 9,610 112,419 79,575 34,492 39,227 2,444 4,753 29,747 98,812 72,230 2000 177,964 7,050 128,622 66,491 26,020 34,972 2,601 8,698 41,289 99,935 78,029 Religion[edit] The 2000 census[update] recorded 66,491 residents (37.4% of the population) as Catholic, while 41,289 people (23.20%) belonged to no church or were agnostic or atheist, 24,105 (13.5%) belonged to the Swiss Reformed Church, and 8,698 (4.89%) were Muslim. There were also 3,959 members of an Orthodox church (2.22%), 220 individuals (or about 0.12% of the population) who belonged to the Christian Catholic Church of Switzerland, 2,422 (1.36%) who belonged to another Christian church, and 2,601 people (1.46%) who were Jewish. There were 707 individuals who were Buddhist, 474 who were Hindu and 423 who belonged to another church. 26,575 respondents (14.93%) did not answer the question.[47] According to 2012 statistics by Swiss Bundesamt für Statistik 49.2% of the population are Christian, divided into 34.2% Catholic, 8.8% Swiss Reformed (organized in the Protestant Church of Geneva) and 6.2% other Christian (mostly various other Protestants), 38% of Genevans are non-religious, 6.1% are Muslim and 1.6% are Jews.[57] Geneva has historically been considered a Protestant city and was known as the Protestant Rome due to it being the base of John Calvin, William Farel, Theodore Beza and other Protestant reformers. Over the past century, substantial immigration from France and other predominantly Catholic countries, as well as general European secularization has changed its religious landscape. As a result, three times as many Roman Catholics as Protestants lived in the city in 2000, while a large number of residents were members of neither group. Geneva forms part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Lausanne, Geneva and Fribourg. The World Council of Churches and the Lutheran World Federation both have their headquarters at the Ecumenical Centre in Grand-Saconnex, Geneva. The World Communion of Reformed Churches, a worldwide organization of Presbyterian, Continental Reformed, Congregational and other Calvinist churches gathering more than 80 million people around the world was based here from 1948 until 2013. The Executive Committee of the World Communion of Reformed Churches voted in 2012 to move its offices to Hanover, Germany, citing the high costs of running the ecumenical organization in Geneva, Switzerland. The move was completed in 2013. Likewise, the Conference of European Churches have moved their headquarters from Geneva to Brussels. ""Protestant Rome""[edit] Reformation Wall in Geneva; from left to right: William Farel, John Calvin, Theodore Beza, and John Knox Prior to the Protestant Reformation the city was de jure and de facto Catholic. Reaction to the new movement varied across Switzerland. John Calvin went to Geneva in 1536 after William Farel encouraged him to do so. In Geneva, the Catholic bishop had been obliged to seek exile in 1532. Geneva became a stronghold of Calvinism. Some of the tenets created there influenced Protestantism as a whole. St. Pierre Cathedral was where Calvin and his Protestant reformers preached. It constituted the epicentre of the newly developing Protestant thought that would later become known as the Reformed tradition. Many prominent Reformed theologians operated there, including William Farel and Theodore Beza, Calvin's successor who progressed Reformed thought after his death. Geneva was a shelter for Calvinists, but at the same time it persecuted Roman Catholics and others considered heretics. The case of Michael Servetus, an early Nontrinitarian, is notable. Condemned by both Catholics and Protestants alike, he was arrested in Geneva and burnt at the stake as a heretic by order of the city's Protestant governing council. John Calvin and his followers denounced him, and possibly contributed to his sentence. In 1802, during its annexation to France under Napoleon I, the Diocese of Geneva was united with the Diocese of Chambéry, but the 1814 Congress of Vienna and the 1816 Treaty of Turin stipulated that in the territories transferred to a now considerably extended Geneva, the Catholic religion was to be protected and that no changes were to be made in existing conditions without an agreement with the Holy See.[24] Napoleon's common policy was to emancipate Catholics in Protestant-majority areas, and the other way around, as well as emancipating Jews. In 1819, the city of Geneva and 20 parishes were united to the Diocese of Lausanne by Pope Pius VII and in 1822, the non-Swiss territory was made into the Diocese of Annecy. A variety of concord with the civil authorities came as a result of the separation of church and state, enacted with strong Catholic support in 1907.[24] Crime[edit] See also: Crime in Switzerland In 2014 the incidence of crimes listed in the Swiss Criminal Code in Geneva was 143.9 per thousand residents. During the same period the rate of drug crimes was 33.6 per thousand residents. The rate of violations of immigration, visa and work permit laws was 35.7 per thousand residents.[58] Cityscape[edit] View of Geneva to the south. Mont Salève (in France) dominates the foreground, with the white summit of Mont Blanc just visible behind it and 70 km (43 mi) away to the southeast. To the left of Mont Blanc is the point of Le Môle. View of Geneva from the Salève. Heritage sites of national significance[edit] There are 82 buildings or sites in Geneva that are listed as Swiss heritage sites of national significance, and the entire old city of Geneva is part of the Inventory of Swiss Heritage Sites.[59] Religious buildings: Cathedral St-Pierre et Chapel des Macchabés, Notre-Dame Church, Russian church, St-Germain Church, Temple de la Fusterie, Temple de l'Auditoire Civic buildings: Former Arsenal and Archives of the City of Genève, Former Crédit Lyonnais, Former Hôtel Buisson, Former Hôtel du Résident de France et Bibliothèque de la Société de lecture de Genève, Former école des arts industriels, Archives d'État de Genève (Annexe), Bâtiment des forces motrices, Bibliothèque de Genève, Library juive de Genève «Gérard Nordmann», Cabinet des estampes, Centre d'Iconographie genevoise, Collège Calvin, École Geisendorf, University Hospital of Geneva (HUG), Hôtel de Ville et tour Baudet, Immeuble Clarté at Rue Saint-Laurent 2 and 4, Immeubles House Rotonde at Rue Charles-Giron 11–19, Immeubles at Rue Beauregard 2, 4, 6, 8, Immeubles at Rue de la Corraterie 10–26, Immeubles at Rue des Granges 2–6, Immeuble at Rue des Granges 8, Immeubles at Rue des Granges 10 and 12, Immeuble at Rue des Granges 14, Immeuble and Former Armory at Rue des Granges 16, Immeubles at Rue Pierre Fatio 7 and 9, House de Saussure at Rue de la Cité 24, House Des arts du Grütli at Rue du Général-Dufour 16, House Royale et les deux immeubles à côté at Quai Gustave Ador 44–50, Tavel House at Rue du Puits-St-Pierre 6, Turrettini House at Rue de l'Hôtel-de-Ville 8 and 10, Brunswick Monument, Palais de Justice, Palais de l'Athénée, Palais des Nations with library and archives of the SDN and ONU, Palais Eynard et Archives de la ville de Genève, Palais Wilson, Parc des Bastions avec Mur des Réformateurs, Place de Neuve et Monument du Général Dufour, Pont de la Machine, Pont sur l'Arve, Poste du Mont-Blanc, Quai du Mont-Blanc, Quai et Hôtel des Bergues, Quai Général Guisan and English Gardens, Quai Gustave-Ador and Jet d'eau, Télévision Suisse Romande, University of Geneva, Victoria Hall.

Le Courrier mainly focuses on Geneva. Both Le Temps (headquartered in Geneva) and Le Matin are widely read in Geneva, but cover the whole of Romandy. Geneva is the main media center for French-speaking Switzerland. It is the headquarters for the numerous French language radio and television networks of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation, known collectively as Radio Télévision Suisse. While both networks cover the whole of Romandy, special programs related to Geneva are sometimes broadcast on some of the local radio frequencies. Other local radio stations broadcast from the city, including YesFM (FM 91.8 MHz), Radio Cité (non-commercial radio, FM 92.2 MHz), OneFM (FM 107.0 MHz, also broadcast in Vaud), and World Radio Switzerland (FM 88.4 MHz). Léman Bleu is a local TV channel, founded in 1996 and distributed by cable. Due to the proximity to France, many French television channels are also available. Traditions and customs[edit] Geneva observes Jeûne genevois on the first Thursday following the first Sunday in September. By local tradition, this commemorates the date news of the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of Huguenots reached Geneva. Geneva celebrates L'Escalade on the weekend nearest 12 December, celebrating the defeat of the surprise attack of troops sent by Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy during the night of 11–12 December 1602. Festive traditions include chocolate cauldrons filled with vegetable-shaped marzipan treats and the Escalade procession on horseback in seventeenth century armour. Geneva has also been organizing a 'Course de l'Escalade', which means 'Climbing Race'. This race takes place in Geneva's Old Town, and has been popular across all ages. Non-competitive racers dress up in fancy costumes, while walking in the race. Since 1818, a particular chestnut tree has been used as the official ""herald of the spring"" in Geneva. The sautier (secretary of the Parliament of the Canton of Geneva) observes the tree and notes the day of arrival of the first bud. While this event has no practical effect, the sautier issues a formal press release and the local newspaper will usually mention the news.[60] As this is one of the world's oldest records of a plant's reaction to climatic conditions, researchers have been interested to note that the first bud has been appearing earlier and earlier in the year. During the 19th century many dates were in March or April. In recent years, they have usually been in late February (sometimes earlier).[61] In 2002, the first bud appeared unusually early, on 7 February, and then again on 29 December of the same year. The following year, one of the hottest years recorded in Europe, was a year with no bud. In 2008, the first bud also appeared early, on 19 February. Music and festivals[edit] Fireworks at the Fêtes de Genève, 2012 The opera house, the Grand Théâtre de Genève, which officially opened in 1876, was partly destroyed by a fire in 1951 and reopened in 1962. It has the largest stage in Switzerland. It features opera and dance performances, recitals, concerts and, occasionally, theatre. The Victoria Hall is used for classical music concerts. It is the home of the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande. Every summer the Fêtes de Genève (Geneva Festival) are organised in Geneva. According to Radio Télévision Suisse in 2013 hundreds of thousands of people came to Geneva to see the annual hour-long grand firework display of the Fêtes de Genève.[62] An annual music festival takes place in June. Groups of artists perform in different parts of the city. In 2016 the festival celebrated its 25th anniversary.[63] Further annual festivals are the Fête de l'Olivier, a festival of Arabic music, organized by the ICAM since 1980,[64] and the Genevan Brass Festival, founded by Christophe Sturzenegger in 2010.[65] Education[edit] Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies The Canton of Geneva's public school system has écoles primaires (ages 4–12) and cycles d'orientation (ages 12–15). Students can leave school at 15, but secondary education is provided by collèges (ages 15–19), the oldest of which is the Collège Calvin, which could be considered one of the oldest public schools in the world,[62][66] écoles de culture générale (15–18/19) and the écoles professionnelles (15–18/19). The écoles professionnelles offer full-time courses and part-time study as part of an apprenticeship. Geneva also has a number of private schools.[67] In 2011 89,244 (37.0%) of the population had completed non-mandatory upper secondary education, and 107,060 or (44.3%) had completed additional higher education (either university or a Fachhochschule). Of the 107,060 who completed tertiary schooling, 32.5% were Swiss men, 31.6% were Swiss women, 18.1% were non-Swiss men and 17.8% were non-Swiss women. During the 2011–2012 school year, there were a total of 92,311 students in the Geneva school system (primary to university). The education system in the Canton of Geneva has eight years of primary school, with 32,716 students. The secondary school program consists of three lower, obligatory years of schooling, followed by three to five years of optional, advanced study. There were 13,146 lower-secondary students who attended schools in Geneva. There were 10,486 upper-secondary students from the municipality along with 10,330 students who were in a professional, non-university track program. An additional 11,797 students were attending private schools.[68] The University of Geneva. Geneva is home to the University of Geneva where approximately 16,500 students are regularly enrolled.[69] In 1559 John Calvin founded the Geneva Academy, a theological and humanist seminary. In the 19th century the Academy lost its ecclesiastic links and in 1873, with the addition of a medical faculty, it became the University of Geneva. In 2011 it was ranked 35th European university.[70] The Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies was among the first academic institutions in the World to teach international relations. It is one of Europe's most prestigious institutions, offering MA and PhD programmes in law, political science, history, economics, international affairs, and development studies. The oldest international school in the world is the International School of Geneva, founded in 1924 along with the League of Nations. The Geneva School of Diplomacy and International Relations is a private university in the grounds of the Château de Penthes. CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research) is probably the best known of Geneva's educational and research facilities, most recently for the Large Hadron Collider. Founded in 1954, CERN was one of Europe's first joint ventures and has developed as the world's largest particle physics laboratory. Physicists from around the world travel to CERN to research matter and explore the fundamental forces and materials that form the universe. Geneva is home to five major libraries, the Bibliothèques municipales Genève, the Haute école de travail social, Institut d'études sociales, the Haute école de santé, the Ecole d'ingénieurs de Genève and the Haute école d'art et de design. There were (as of 2008[update]) 877,680 books or other media in the libraries, and in the same year 1,798,980 items were loaned.[71] Economy[edit] Geneva's economy is largely service-driven and closely linked to the rest of the canton. The city is often ranked as one of the strongest global financial centres, ranking 9th in the world in 2020[72] and 2nd in Europe behind London. Three main sectors dominate the financial sector: commodity trading; trade finance, and wealth management. Around a third of the world's free traded oil, sugar, grains and oil seeds is traded in Geneva. Approximately 22% of the world's cotton is traded in the Lake Geneva region. Other major commodities traded in the canton include steel, electricity, or coffee.[73] Large trading companies have their regional or global headquarters in the canton, such as Bunge, Cargill, Vitol, Gunvor, BNP Paribas, or Mercuria Energy Group, in addition to being home to the world's second largest shipping company, Mediterranean Shipping Company. Commodity trading is sustained by a strong trade finance sector, with large banks such as BCGE, BCP, BNP Paribas, BCV, Crédit Agricole, Credit Suisse, ING, Société Générale, and UBS, all having their headquarters in the area for this business. Wealth management is dominated by private banks, particularly Pictet, Lombard Odier, Edmond de Rothschild Group, Union Bancaire Privée, Mirabaud Group, Dukascopy Bank, Bordier & Cie, Banque SYZ, or REYL & Cie. In addition, the canton is home to the largest concentration of foreign-owned banks in Switzerland, such as HSBC Private Bank, JPMorgan Chase, or Arab Bank. Behind the financial sector, the next largest major economic sector is watchmaking, dominated by luxury firms Rolex, Richemont, Patek Philippe, Piaget, Roger Dubuis, and others, whose factories are concentrated in the Les Acacias neighbourhood, as well as the neighbouring municipalities of Plan-les-Ouates, Satigny, and Meyrin. Trade finance, wealth management, and watchmaking, approximately contribute two thirds of the corporate tax paid in the canton[74] Other large multinationals are also headquartered in the city and canton, such as Firmenich (in Satigny), and Givaudan (in Vernier), the world's two largest manufacturers of flavours, fragrances and active cosmetic ingredients; SGS, the world's largest inspection, verification, testing and certification services company; Temenos, a large banking software provider; or the local headquarters for Procter & Gamble, Japan Tobacco International, or L'Oréal (in Vernier). Although they do not directly contribute to the local economy, the city of Geneva is also host to the world's largest concentration of international organisations and UN agencies, such as the Red Cross, the World Health Organization, the World Trade Organization, the International Telecommunication Union, the World Intellectual Property Organization, the World Meteorological Organization, and the International Labour Organization, as well as the European headquarters of the United Nations. Its international mindedness, well-connected airport, and centrality in the continent, also make Geneva a good destination for congresses and trade fairs, of which the largest is the Geneva Motor Show held in Palexpo. Agriculture is commonplace in the hinterlands of Geneva, particularly wheat and wine. Despite its relatively small size, the canton produces around 10% of the Swiss wine and has the highest vineyard density in the country.[75] The largest strains grown in Geneva are gamay, chasselas, pinot noir, gamaret, and chardonnay. As of  2019[update], Geneva had an unemployment rate of 3.9%.[76] As of 2008[update], there were five[clarification needed] people employed in the primary economic sector and about three[clarification needed] businesses involved in this sector. 9,783 people were employed in the secondary sector and there were 1,200 businesses in this sector. 134,429 people were employed in the tertiary sector, with 12,489 businesses in this sector.[49] There were 91,880 residents of the municipality who were employed in some capacity, with women making up 47.7% of the workforce. In 2008[update], the total number of full-time equivalent jobs was 124,185. The number of jobs in the primary sector was four, all of which were in agriculture. The number of jobs in the secondary sector was 9,363 of which 4,863 or (51.9%) were in manufacturing and 4,451 (47.5%) were in construction. The number of jobs in the tertiary sector was 114,818. In the tertiary sector; 16,573 or 14.4% were in wholesale or retail sales or the repair of motor vehicles, 3,474 or 3.0% were in the movement and storage of goods, 9,484 or 8.3% were in a hotel or restaurant, 4,544 or 4.0% were in the information industry, 20,982 or 18.3% were the insurance or financial industry, 12,177 or 10.6% were technical professionals or scientists, 10,007 or 8.7% were in education and 15,029 or 13.1% were in health care.[77] In 2000[update], there were 95,190 workers who commuted into the municipality and 25,920 workers who commuted away. The municipality is a net importer of workers, with about 3.7 workers entering the municipality for every one leaving. About 13.8% of the workforce coming into Geneva are coming from outside Switzerland, while 0.4% of the locals commute out of Switzerland for work.[78] Of the working population, 38.2% used public transportation to get to work, and 30.6% used a private car.[49] Sport[edit] Ice hockey is the most popular sport in Geneva.[79] Geneva is home to Genève-Servette HC, which plays in the National League (NL). They play their home games in the 7,135-seat Patinoire des Vernets. In 2008, 2010 and 2021 the team made it to the league finals but lost to the ZSC Lions, SC Bern and EV Zug respectively.[80] The team is by far the most popular one in both the city and the canton of Geneva, drawing three times more spectators than the football team in 2017.[81][82] The town is home to Servette FC, a football club founded in 1890 and named after a borough on the right bank of the Rhône. The home of Servette FC is the 30,000-seat Stade de Genève. Servette FC plays in the Credit Suisse Super League. Étoile Carouge FC and Urania Genève Sport also play in the city. Geneva is home to the basketball team Lions de Genève, 2013 and 2015 champions of the Swiss Basketball League. The team plays its home games in the Pavilion des Sports. Geneva Jets Australian Football Club have been playing Australian Football in the AFL Switzerland league since 2019. Infrastructure[edit] Transportation[edit] This section needs to be updated. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (July 2020) Main article: Transports Publics Genevois Geneva railway station TCMC (Tramway Cornavin – Meyrin – CERN) The city is served by the Geneva Airport. It is connected by Geneva Airport railway station (French: Gare de Genève-Aéroport) to both the Swiss Federal Railways network and the French SNCF network, including links to Paris, Lyon, Marseille and Montpellier by TGV. Geneva is connected to the motorway systems of both Switzerland (A1 motorway) and France. Public transport by bus, trolleybus or tram is provided by Transports Publics Genevois. In addition to an extensive coverage of the city centre, the network extends to most of the municipalities of the Canton, with a few lines reaching into France. Public transport by boat is provided by the Mouettes Genevoises, which link the two banks of the lake within the city, and by the Compagnie Générale de Navigation sur le lac Léman which serves more distant destinations such as Nyon, Yvoire, Thonon, Évian, Lausanne and Montreux using both modern diesel vessels and vintage paddle steamers. Geneva Sécheron railway station Trains operated by Swiss Federal Railways connect the airport to the main station of Cornavin in six minutes. Regional train services are being developed towards Coppet and Bellegarde. At the city limits two new railway stations have been opened since 2002: Genève-Sécheron (close to the UN and the Botanical Gardens) and Lancy-Pont-Rouge. In 2011 work started on the CEVA rail (Cornavin – Eaux-Vives – Annemasse) project, first planned in 1884, which will connect Cornavin with the Cantonal hospital, Eaux-Vives railway station and Annemasse, in France. The link between the main railway station and the classification yard of La Praille already exists; from there, the line runs mostly underground to the Hospital and Eaux-Vives, where it links to the existing line to France. The line fully opened in December 2019, as part of the Léman Express regional rail network. TOSA Bus at PALEXPO Flash bus stops In May 2013, the demonstrator electric bus system[83] with a capacity of 133 passengers commenced between Geneva Airport and Palexpo. The project aims to introduce a new system of mass transport with electric ""flash"" recharging of the buses at selected stops while passengers are disembarking and embarking.[84] Taxis in Geneva can be difficult to find, and may need to be booked in advance, especially in the early morning or at peak hours. Taxis can refuse to take babies and children because of seating legislation.[85] An ambitious project to close 200 streets in the centre of Geneva to cars was approved by the Geneva cantonal authorities in 2010 and was planned to be implemented over a span of four years (2010–2014), though as of 2018[update], work on the project has yet to be started.[86] Utilities[edit] Water, natural gas and electricity are provided to the municipalities of the Canton of Geneva by the state-owned Services Industriels de Genève, known as SIG. Most of the drinking water (80%) is extracted from the lake; the remaining 20% is provided by groundwater, originally formed by infiltration from the Arve. 30% of the Canton's electricity needs is locally produced, mainly by three hydroelectric dams on the Rhône (Seujet, Verbois and Chancy-Pougny). In addition, 13% of the electricity produced in the Canton is from the burning of waste at the waste incineration facility of Les Cheneviers. The remaining needs (57%) are covered by imports from other cantons in Switzerland or other European countries; SIG buys only electricity produced by renewable methods, and in particular does not use electricity produced using nuclear reactors or fossil fuels. Natural gas is available in the City of Geneva, as well as in about two-thirds of the municipalities of the canton, and is imported from Western Europe by the Swiss company Gaznat. SIG also provides telecommunication facilities to carriers, service providers and large enterprises. From 2003 to 2005, ""Voisin, voisine"" a fibre to the Home pilot project with a triple play offering was launched to test the end-user market in the Charmilles district. International organisations[edit] See also: List of international organizations based in Geneva The World Intellectual Property Organization. The assembly hall of the Palace of Nations. Geneva is the European headquarters of the United Nations, in the Palace of Nations building, which was also the headquarters of the former League of Nations. Several agencies are headquartered at Geneva, including the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the World Health Organization, the International Labour Organization, International Telecommunication Union, the International Baccalaureate Organization and the World Intellectual Property Organization. Apart from the UN agencies, Geneva hosts many inter-governmental organizations, such as the World Trade Organization, the South Centre, the World Meteorological Organization, the World Economic Forum, the International Organization for Migration, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the International Committee of the Red Cross. The Maison de la Paix building hosts the three Geneva centres supported by the Swiss Confederation: the International Centre for Humanitarian Demining, the Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces and the Geneva Centre for Security Policy, as well as other organisations active in the field of peace, international affairs and sustainable development.[87] Organizations on the European level include the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research) which is the world's largest particle physics laboratory. The Geneva Environment Network (GEN) publishes the Geneva Green Guide,[88] an extensive listing of Geneva-based global organisations working on environment protection and sustainable development. A website,[89] jointly run by the Swiss Government, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, the United Nations Environment Programme and the International Union for Conservation of Nature, includes accounts of how NGOs, business, government and the UN cooperate. By doing so, it attempts to explain why Geneva has been picked by so many NGOs and UN bodies as their headquarters' location. The World Organization of the Scout Movement and the World Scout Bureau Central Office are headquartered in Geneva.

Contents 1 Operations 2 Impact and influence 3 Membership 3.1 Forética 4 Governance 5 Geographic balance 6 Controversies 7 References 8 External links Operations[edit] The Council works on a variety of issues related to sustainable development. It works to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through the transformation of six economic systems. These are circular economy,[9] Cities and Mobility,[10] Climate and Energy,[11] Food, Land and Water,[12] People[13] and Redefining Value.[14] Each system transformation is set up as a WBCSD Program with a number of supplementary Projects.[15] Impact and influence[edit] A 2003 World Bank/IFC commissioned study identified the WBCSD as one of the ""most influential forums"" for companies on corporate social responsibility (CSR) issues.[16] A 2004 Globescan survey found the WBCSD as the second most effective SD research organization.[17] The 2006 survey by the same company reports that 54% of all surveyed experts believe the WBCSD will play a ""major role"" in advancing sustainable development. Only the European Union received higher approval (69%).[18] In the 2007's Ethisphere Institute list of the 100 Most Influential People in Business Ethics, WBCSD President Bjoern Stigson has been ranked ninth, which made him the second most influential NGO leader.[19] Membership[edit] Membership of the WBCSD is by invitation of the Executive Committee to companies committed to sustainable development. Among its over 180 members[20] are well-known companies such as DuPont, 3M, Nestlé, BP, Danone and Royal Dutch Shell. WBCSD provides its members with the value, impact and voice to navigate unprecedented global changes and allows them to prosper from transforming their operations. By joining the WBCSD, member companies benefit from insights into the latest knowledge on sustainability, sustainability tools, peer collaboration across the value chain, participation in policy development and a chance to profile their sustainability work.[20] Member companies pledge their support and contribution to the WBCSD by making available their knowledge and experience, and appropriate human resources. They are asked to publicly report on their environmental performance and to aspire to widen their reporting to cover all three pillars of sustainable development – economic, social and environmental. A key element is the personal commitment of the Chief Executive Officers (CEOs), acting as Council Members. They are influential advocates for the WBCSD's policy positions and they co-chair the working groups. They also organize support for the WBCSD's work program and ensure the adoption of sustainable management practices within their companies. Forética[edit] Forética claims to be global network of Spanish speaking businesses and professionals whose mission is to promote an ethical management and corporate social responsibility by the establishment of a National standard in Spain known as SGE-21, (sistema de gestación ética para siglo 21) which is also Annex 1 to ISO 26000 and supported by CSR Europe[21] Membership is said to around 400 and includes companies of all sizes and sectors, as well as individual specialists, professionals and academics and it was incorporated into WBCSD on 2 September 2014.[22] Governance[edit] The WBCSD is a member-led organization governed by a Council composed of the Council Members of its member companies. The Council elects the Executive Committee, including the Chairman and four Vice Chairmen. Past chairmen include: Rodney F. Chase – BP (1995) Livio D. DeSimone – 3M (1996/97) Egil Myklebust – Norsk Hydro (1998/99) Charles O. Holliday, Jr. – DuPont (2000/01) Sir Philip Watts KCMG – Royal Dutch Shell (2002/03) Bertrand Collomb – Lafarge (2004/05) Travis Engen – Alcan (2006/07) Sam DiPiazza – PwC (2008/09) Paul Polman – Unilever (2012–17) Sunny Verghese – Olam (2018–2020) Geographic balance[edit] Most of WBCSD's member companies are headquartered in Europe (47%). 22% member companies are headquartered in Asia, 22% in North America and 5% in Latin America. The geographically least represented regions are Africa, Australasia and the Middle East with 1% each.[20] Controversies[edit] According to Greenpeace the World Business Council for Sustainable Development is among the key players responsible for holding the world societies from tackling the climate change and energy management challenges for the past 20 years. The WBCSD Executive Committee was dominated by the largest non-renewable energy and carbon-intensive companies in the world at least until 2011. According to Greenpeace the WBCSD executive committee has been a 'Who's Who' of the world's largest carbon-intensive companies.[23] The Sierra Club has collaborated with the World Business Council on a number of initiatives, as well as inviting its representatives to speak at Sierra Club events.[24][25] The Environmental Defense Fund recommends the World Business Council's auditing methods to companies seeking to reduce greenhouse emissions,[26] and the Natural Resources Defense Council has drawn upon WBCSD guidelines in drawing up their own guidelines for determining biofuels sustainability.[27] The WBCSD's Vision 2050 report was highlighted by The Guardian as ""the largest concerted corporate sustainability action plan to date – include reversing the damage done to ecosystems, addressing rising greenhouse gas emissions and ensuring societies move to sustainable agriculture.""[28] References[edit] ^ ""Sunny Verghese appointed as WBCSD Chair from 2018"".

We are deeply concerned that since 1 Feb 2021, 550 civilians have been killed, including 46 children (According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners AAPP).

It may require cleanup to comply with Wikipedia's content policies, particularly neutral point of view. Please discuss further on the talk page. (June 2021) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Swisscontact – Swiss Foundation for Technical Cooperation is a Swiss non-profit-organisation, which carries out projects aiming at reducing poverty in developing and transition countries by private sector development. It has been founded in 1959 as a politically and denominationally neutral organisation and has 60 employees in Switzerland and approximately 1,400 staff abroad. The main fields of activity are fostering skills development, small and medium enterprises, financial services and resource efficiency. Contents 1 History 2 Organisation 3 Topical priorities 3.1 Skills development 3.2 Enterprise Promotion 3.3 Inclusive Finance 3.4 Climate-smart Economy 3.5 Senior Expert Corps 4 Further reading 5 References 6 Publications by Swisscontact History[edit] The aim of all of Swisscontact's activities is to reduce poverty by private sector development.[1] Swisscontact was founded in 1959 under the name of Swiss Foundation for Technical Cooperation by leading figures from the Swiss business world, universities and politics. The first initiative came from Anne-Marie Im Hof-Piguet (1916-2010), who was of the opinion ""that because of its wealth and as country without a colonial past, Switzerland should play an important role in development aid"".[2] In the 1960s, Swisscontact set up vocational training colleges in Africa, Asia and Latin America and provided further training for the instructors at these colleges. This was followed in the 1980s by the launch of schemes aimed at promoting small and medium enterprises (SMEs), after graduates from the vocational training colleges had said that there was an urgent need for expert advice when setting up businesses. It was also evident that SMEs were experiencing considerable difficulty in obtaining commercial and investment credits. As a result, the organization introduced programmes favouring the creation of micro-finance institutions. After training car mechanics, Swisscontact also went on to develop integral solutions for preventing air pollution. The organization was renamed in 1972, but retained its old title as a supplement. Organisation[edit] Swisscontact has approximately 1,100 staff worldwide. It carries out around 120 projects in 39 different countries to promote economic stability.[3] The board of trustees consists of about 30 people from the business world, university and politics. Swisscontact is specialized in project implementation, accepts assignments from public and private partners and carries out projects that have been put out to public tender. The organization also runs a programme of its own activities that are financed from donations and contributions from the state. The foundation with headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland, is certified with the ZEWO seal of quality from the Swiss agency responsible for monitoring charitable organizations that raise donations in Switzerland. Two important partners of Swisscontact are the governmental organisations Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) and the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO). Since 2019, Springfield Centre, Durham (GB), has been a subsidiary of Swisscontact.[4] The Springfield Centre is a consulting, training and research company focused on market systems development.[5] Topical priorities[edit] Swisscontact is convinced that employment and income open up pathways out of poverty and can reduce economic disparities. An innovative private sector strengthens structurally weak regions and enables disadvantaged groups to become active market participators.[6] All activities of Swisscontact can be divided into four areas of operation: Skills development[edit] Since 1959 Swisscontact has been committed to providing vocational training and further education, the assumption being that professional competence is the key to the economic and social development of a country. Swisscontact started off by setting up technical vocational training colleges (for mechanics, electricians, electronic technicians, etc.) based on the Swiss model in countries where infrastructure was lacking. Over the past 25 years the main focus in the promotion of vocational training has shifted to instructing vocational training college instructors and setting up national vocational training systems on the one hand and to holding shorter courses on the other, in particular for unemployed youngsters and disadvantaged sectors of the population (in development cooperation usually called «skills training»). In simple basic courses, they can acquire knowledge that will give them the chance to find a job or become self-employed. Emphasis is always placed on getting as many women as possible involved in the schemes. At present, around 45% of those who have benefited are women.[7][8] Swisscontact supports practical vocational training by: Vocational education and training: Swisscontact works locally through existing institutions and training centres, usually by training teachers and instructors or with the establishment of teacher training institutes. Labor market insertion: This includes instruments like counseling, placement services, work programmes, employment incentives, internships, occupational and life skills training, start-up incentives.[9] Enterprise Promotion[edit] Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are the largest employers in developing countries as well. Swisscontact aims at strengthening the competitiveness of small and medium-sized businesses. The organisation's market system development approach, referred to as Inclusive Markets addresses the constraints and opportunities of markets for disadvantaged people. To make markets more inclusive, Swisscontact refers to three different approaches: Value chain development: This approach focuses on a certain sector with growth potential. It supports small businesses, especially farmer organisations, to establish themselves as suppliers in national and global value chains by training and technical assistance or quality management. Regional and local economic development: In cases where geographic isolation is the primary constraint, the specific local development potential is taken as a starting point. Entrepreneurship: Swisscontact supports innovative, risk-oriented individuals to seize business opportunities by facilitating business enabling environments, access to financial services and to non-financial resources such as information and know-how.[10][11] In practice, these approaches are often combined. Inclusive Finance[edit] In development cooperation, all financial services provided for people on low incomes in developing countries are bracketed together under the collective term microfinance. Their aim is to give small and medium enterprises access to banking services that allow them to maintain or expand their companies. Swisscontact does not grant microcredits, but instead assists local microcredit banks, insurance companies and savings and credit associations with advice and further training.[12] Swisscontact's activities in financial services include: develop financial products services and products with local partners for small enterprises capacity building in financial skills develop new technologies and improve infrastructure improve the regulatory framework Swisscontact especially promotes microleasing (leasing productive assets, e.g. agricultural tools, livestock).[13] Climate-smart Economy[edit] Swisscontact is working for an economically, socially and ecologically sustainable development and is considering the responsible use of natural resources a prerequisite to achieve this. The organisations believes that services related to climate protection and associated technologies represent a growth market and will in future be able to provide people with jobs and income in developing countries as well. An example of this is recycling of reusable materials. Swisscontact lends its support by: Situational analyses Public relations work to increase environmental awareness Advising authorities on drafting laws and decrees Training instructors and professionals and strengthening the dialogue between different actors and civil society Transfer of technologies and processes[14] Senior Expert Corps[edit] Since 1979 Swisscontact has a pool of retired professionals called the Senior Expert Corps. Its members are supporting SMEs in developing and transition countries in solving technical and operational problems on a voluntary basis. If necessary they provide further training to the personnel and management of the company. One assignment lasts a maximum of three months.[15] The pool contains experts in: marketing and management consulting, electrical, civil and mechanical engineering, hotel and tourism services, food engineering, education, medical and health care services, agronomy and forestry engineering, construction and other specialized fields.[16] Further reading[edit] Franziska Diener: Die Schweizerische Stiftung für technische Entwicklungshilfe (Swisscontact) 1956 – 1971 Entwicklungszusammenarbeit der Schweizer Privatwirtschaft.

It may require cleanup to comply with Wikipedia's content policies, particularly neutral point of view. Please discuss further on the talk page. (June 2021) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Swisscontact – Swiss Foundation for Technical Cooperation is a Swiss non-profit-organisation, which carries out projects aiming at reducing poverty in developing and transition countries by private sector development. It has been founded in 1959 as a politically and denominationally neutral organisation and has 60 employees in Switzerland and approximately 1,400 staff abroad. The main fields of activity are fostering skills development, small and medium enterprises, financial services and resource efficiency. Contents 1 History 2 Organisation 3 Topical priorities 3.1 Skills development 3.2 Enterprise Promotion 3.3 Inclusive Finance 3.4 Climate-smart Economy 3.5 Senior Expert Corps 4 Further reading 5 References 6 Publications by Swisscontact History[edit] The aim of all of Swisscontact's activities is to reduce poverty by private sector development.[1] Swisscontact was founded in 1959 under the name of Swiss Foundation for Technical Cooperation by leading figures from the Swiss business world, universities and politics. The first initiative came from Anne-Marie Im Hof-Piguet (1916-2010), who was of the opinion ""that because of its wealth and as country without a colonial past, Switzerland should play an important role in development aid"".[2] In the 1960s, Swisscontact set up vocational training colleges in Africa, Asia and Latin America and provided further training for the instructors at these colleges. This was followed in the 1980s by the launch of schemes aimed at promoting small and medium enterprises (SMEs), after graduates from the vocational training colleges had said that there was an urgent need for expert advice when setting up businesses. It was also evident that SMEs were experiencing considerable difficulty in obtaining commercial and investment credits. As a result, the organization introduced programmes favouring the creation of micro-finance institutions. After training car mechanics, Swisscontact also went on to develop integral solutions for preventing air pollution. The organization was renamed in 1972, but retained its old title as a supplement. Organisation[edit] Swisscontact has approximately 1,100 staff worldwide. It carries out around 120 projects in 39 different countries to promote economic stability.[3] The board of trustees consists of about 30 people from the business world, university and politics. Swisscontact is specialized in project implementation, accepts assignments from public and private partners and carries out projects that have been put out to public tender. The organization also runs a programme of its own activities that are financed from donations and contributions from the state. The foundation with headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland, is certified with the ZEWO seal of quality from the Swiss agency responsible for monitoring charitable organizations that raise donations in Switzerland. Two important partners of Swisscontact are the governmental organisations Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) and the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO). Since 2019, Springfield Centre, Durham (GB), has been a subsidiary of Swisscontact.[4] The Springfield Centre is a consulting, training and research company focused on market systems development.[5] Topical priorities[edit] Swisscontact is convinced that employment and income open up pathways out of poverty and can reduce economic disparities. An innovative private sector strengthens structurally weak regions and enables disadvantaged groups to become active market participators.[6] All activities of Swisscontact can be divided into four areas of operation: Skills development[edit] Since 1959 Swisscontact has been committed to providing vocational training and further education, the assumption being that professional competence is the key to the economic and social development of a country. Swisscontact started off by setting up technical vocational training colleges (for mechanics, electricians, electronic technicians, etc.) based on the Swiss model in countries where infrastructure was lacking. Over the past 25 years the main focus in the promotion of vocational training has shifted to instructing vocational training college instructors and setting up national vocational training systems on the one hand and to holding shorter courses on the other, in particular for unemployed youngsters and disadvantaged sectors of the population (in development cooperation usually called «skills training»). In simple basic courses, they can acquire knowledge that will give them the chance to find a job or become self-employed. Emphasis is always placed on getting as many women as possible involved in the schemes. At present, around 45% of those who have benefited are women.[7][8] Swisscontact supports practical vocational training by: Vocational education and training: Swisscontact works locally through existing institutions and training centres, usually by training teachers and instructors or with the establishment of teacher training institutes. Labor market insertion: This includes instruments like counseling, placement services, work programmes, employment incentives, internships, occupational and life skills training, start-up incentives.[9] Enterprise Promotion[edit] Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are the largest employers in developing countries as well. Swisscontact aims at strengthening the competitiveness of small and medium-sized businesses. The organisation's market system development approach, referred to as Inclusive Markets addresses the constraints and opportunities of markets for disadvantaged people. To make markets more inclusive, Swisscontact refers to three different approaches: Value chain development: This approach focuses on a certain sector with growth potential. It supports small businesses, especially farmer organisations, to establish themselves as suppliers in national and global value chains by training and technical assistance or quality management. Regional and local economic development: In cases where geographic isolation is the primary constraint, the specific local development potential is taken as a starting point. Entrepreneurship: Swisscontact supports innovative, risk-oriented individuals to seize business opportunities by facilitating business enabling environments, access to financial services and to non-financial resources such as information and know-how.[10][11] In practice, these approaches are often combined. Inclusive Finance[edit] In development cooperation, all financial services provided for people on low incomes in developing countries are bracketed together under the collective term microfinance. Their aim is to give small and medium enterprises access to banking services that allow them to maintain or expand their companies. Swisscontact does not grant microcredits, but instead assists local microcredit banks, insurance companies and savings and credit associations with advice and further training.[12] Swisscontact's activities in financial services include: develop financial products services and products with local partners for small enterprises capacity building in financial skills develop new technologies and improve infrastructure improve the regulatory framework Swisscontact especially promotes microleasing (leasing productive assets, e.g. agricultural tools, livestock).[13] Climate-smart Economy[edit] Swisscontact is working for an economically, socially and ecologically sustainable development and is considering the responsible use of natural resources a prerequisite to achieve this. The organisations believes that services related to climate protection and associated technologies represent a growth market and will in future be able to provide people with jobs and income in developing countries as well. An example of this is recycling of reusable materials. Swisscontact lends its support by: Situational analyses Public relations work to increase environmental awareness Advising authorities on drafting laws and decrees Training instructors and professionals and strengthening the dialogue between different actors and civil society Transfer of technologies and processes[14] Senior Expert Corps[edit] Since 1979 Swisscontact has a pool of retired professionals called the Senior Expert Corps. Its members are supporting SMEs in developing and transition countries in solving technical and operational problems on a voluntary basis. If necessary they provide further training to the personnel and management of the company. One assignment lasts a maximum of three months.[15] The pool contains experts in: marketing and management consulting, electrical, civil and mechanical engineering, hotel and tourism services, food engineering, education, medical and health care services, agronomy and forestry engineering, construction and other specialized fields.[16] Further reading[edit] Franziska Diener: Die Schweizerische Stiftung für technische Entwicklungshilfe (Swisscontact) 1956 – 1971 Entwicklungszusammenarbeit der Schweizer Privatwirtschaft.

Such technology can prevent carbon dioxide from being emitted to the air. It reduces carbon emission from power plants by about 85%-90%. The technology can be divided into capture, transportation, and storage. In 2005, IPCC set up “Special Report on Carbon Capture and Storage (SRCCS)”. The report indicated the method of CCS and its importance to reduction of greenhouse gas. The principle of CCS is that CO2 stored deeply in the high-pressure formations about 800 meter in depth becomes “fluid” under the high-density supercritical state. Such CO2 is injected into the reservoir beds where a great amount of open pores interconnect with each other. Fluids flow among them and are stored in the inter-space. Geological storage refers to CO2 stored in the formations stably for more than a thousand year. It is currently considered the quite potential mechanism for CO2 reduction in the world. According to Technology Roadmap Carbon capture and storage proposed by International Energy Agency (IEA) in 2013, the goal to reduce the emission of greenhouse gas to half of that in 2009 should be achieved through technologies of greenhouse gas reduction, such as development of renewable energy, improvement in energy efficiency, and carbon capture storage (CCS). Among these technologies, CCS accounts for 14% of the total reduction. Since CCS is the important option for emission reduction, it should be included as one of important technologies to fight against global warming. According to the forecast in Key World Energy Statistics 2005 conducted by IEA in 2005, the global use rate of renewable energy in 2030 was still the same as that in 2003. In the period, the growth rate of supply of renewable energy was the same as that of supply of total energy; that is, an increase by 56.4%. As a result, it is estimated that fossil fuels will remain the main source of energy supply in next 50 or 100 years. In this case, the importance of application of CCS is highlighted.

forecasts global carbon capture capacity to reach 1,265 megatonnes by 2040 Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) 2021-2040 A technology and industry perspective, including carbon pricing, point-source carbon capture, direct air capture, carbon dioxide-to-fuels, carbon dioxide-to-chemicals, enhanced oil recovery, and geological storage By Dr Michael Dent Order now Order in a Subscription About subscriptions Show All Description Contents, Table & Figures List Pricing Related Content Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS), or carbon capture and storage (CCS), refers to the set of technologies that trap carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, before either storing them underground or using them for a range of industrial applications. CCUS technologies may be essential for mitigating global CO2 emissions and keeping the world within the 2°C of warming as outlined in the Paris Agreement. Over the last decade, deployment of CCUS technology has expanded quickly, with global CO2 capture capacity reaching 40 million tonnes by 2020. While this is a significant achievement, it is still not enough to have a meaningful impact on climate change - meeting the Paris Agreement could require global carbon capture capacity to reach gigatonnes per year. Achieving this will require collaboration between industry and government to overcome the technological and economic hurdles associated with CCUS technology, something that could lead to significant opportunity for early movers. This report provides a comprehensive view of the global CCUS industry, providing a detailed analysis of both the technological and economic factors that are set to shape the industry over the next twenty years. The report considers carbon capture, carbon utilization, and carbon storage individually, discussing the technology innovations, key players and opportunities within each area, alongside a twenty-year forecast for the deployment of carbon capture technology. The report also considers carbon pricing, providing an overview of carbon taxes and emissions trading schemes (ETS) across the world and discussing how they can incentivise CCUS deployment. Key questions answered in this reportWhat is CCUS and how can it be used to address climate change?Where is CCUS currently deployed?What is the market outlook for CCUS?What are the key drivers and restraints of market growth?How do carbon pricing schemes look across the worldHow much does carbon capture technology cost?What can carbon dioxide be used for industrially?Where are the key growth opportunities for carbon dioxide utilization?Who are the key players in CCUS?Can CCUS help the world meet the Paris Agreement?  The major steps involved in carbon capture, utilization, and storage. Note, these can all take place within the same facility Carbon CaptureCarbon dioxide can be captured from both industrial waste gas streams (point-source carbon capture) and directly from the atmosphere (direct air capture). It is generally easiest to capture CO2 from point sources, where CO2 concentrations are higher, and all current industrial scale CO2 capture project rely on point source carbon capture. However, although it is more expensive and less technologically developed, direct air capture has the potential to actively remove CO2 from atmosphere (i.e., it is a negative emissions technology) and has drawn much excitement in recent years, with companies such as Climeworks, Carbon Engineering and Global Thermostat raising hundreds of millions of dollars in funding and engaging in partnerships with major oil and gas companies. The report provides a detailed analysis of both point-source carbon capture and direct air capture, discussing the technologies involved in both processes and providing an economic outlook for both industries. It includes analysis of the technologies used by industry players, the costs involved in carbon capture and areas of innovation within the field, alongside an evaluation of the future of the industry. Carbon UtilizationAlthough almost all of the CO2 captured today is stored deep underground, either in dedicated geological storage sites or for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) applications, CO2 is a potentially useful feedstock for a variety of industrial processes. CO2 is a versatile molecule that can be chemically converted into a large range of products, including fuels, chemicals, building materials and polymers. Some of these products, such as fuels, will release the carbon stored in them almost immediately, so can only be carbon-neutral products, whereas others, such as building materials, can sequester the carbon for thousands of years. The main issue with carbon utilization is that CO2 is a very stable molecule, so a lot of energy is needed to convert it into useful products. Innovative companies across the world are developing technology to improve the energy efficiency of CO2 conversion processes, while the increasing availability of cheap, renewable energy is helping to make CO2 utilization a commercially viable industry. The report provides an analysis of the major emerging areas of carbon utilization: CO2-derived fuels, CO2-derived chemicals, CO2-derived building materials, and the use of CO2 to boost yields of biological processes. It discusses the advantages and disadvantages of each application, alongside the potential market size and potential impacts of each area on climate change.  Some key players in the carbon dioxide utilization industry Carbon storageCarbon storage (also known as carbon sequestration or carbon dioxide removal) is the long-term removal, capture or sequestration of CO2, where captured CO2 is stored underground in a range of locations, including oil reservoirs, saline formations and unmineable coal seams. Because the scale of CO2 emissions ¬far exceeds the current capacity for CO2 utilization, it is likely that carbon storage will play a major role in future emissions mitigation. Currently, most carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects use captured CO2 for enhanced oil recovery (EOR), where CO2 is injected into depleted oil wells to help increase oil output. Outside of tax credits, this remains one of the only ways that carbon storage can be monetised, although it can require high oil prices to be commercially viable and may struggle as a long term option in a world increasingly transitioning away from fossil fuels. The report discusses the various options for carbon storage, including the mechanisms of CO2 trapping, the different options for geologic CO2 storage and the global potential for CO2 storage. It discusses how EOR can be an on-ramp for wider CCS deployment, and discusses the implications of oil prices on CCS, particularly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

R&D activities differ from institution to institution, with two primary models[1] of an R&D department either staffed by engineers and tasked with directly developing new products, or staffed with industrial scientists and tasked with applied research in scientific or technological fields, which may facilitate future product development. R&D differs from the vast majority of corporate activities in that it is not intended to yield immediate profit, and generally carries greater risk and an uncertain return on investment.[2] However R&D is crucial for acquiring larger shares of the market through the marketisation of new products.[1] R&D&I or R&D&i are also acronyms with the same general meaning of R&D and stand for research, development and innovation.[3][4][5] Contents 1 Background 2 Business R&D 2.1 Benefit by sector 2.2 Risks 2.3 Global 3 Government expenditures 3.1 United States 3.2 European Union 3.3 Worldwide 4 See also 5 References 6 External links Background[edit] New product design and development is often a crucial factor in the survival of a company. In a global industrial landscape that is changing fast, firms must continually revise their design and range of products. This is necessary as well due to the fierce competition and the evolving preferences of consumers. Without an R&D program, a firm must rely on strategic alliances, acquisitions, and networks to tap into the innovations of others. A system driven by marketing is one that puts the customer needs first, and produces goods that are known to sell.[6] Market research is carried out, which establishes the needs of consumers and the potential niche market of a new product. If the development is technology driven, R&D is directed toward developing products to meet the unmet needs.[citation needed] In general, research and development activities are conducted by specialized units or centers belonging to a company, or can be out-sourced to a contract research organization, universities, or state agencies.[7] In the context of commerce, ""research and development"" normally refers to future-oriented, longer-term activities in science or technology, using similar techniques to scientific research but directed toward desired outcomes and with broad forecasts of commercial yield.[8] Statistics on organizations devoted to ""R&D"" may express the state of an industry, the degree of competition or the lure of progress.[9] Some common measures include: budgets, numbers of patents or on rates of peer-reviewed publications. Bank ratios are one of the best measures, because they are continuously maintained, public and reflect risk. In the United States, a typical ratio of research and development for an industrial company is about 3.5% of revenues; this measure is called ""R&D intensity"".[citation needed] A high technology company, such as a computer manufacturer, might spend 7% or a pharmaceutical companies such as Merck & Co. 14.1% or Novartis 15.1%. Anything over 15% is remarkable, and usually gains a reputation for being a high technology company such as engineering company Ericsson 24.9%, or biotech company Allergan, which tops the spending table with 43.4% investment.[10] Such companies are often seen as credit risks because their spending ratios are so unusual.[citation needed] Generally such firms prosper only in markets whose customers have extreme high technology needs, like certain prescription drugs or special chemicals, scientific instruments, and safety-critical systems in medicine, aeronautics or military weapons.[citation needed]The extreme needs justify the high risk of failure and consequently high gross margins from 60% to 90% of revenues.[citation needed] That is, gross profits will be as much as 90% of the sales cost, with manufacturing costing only 10% of the product price, because so many individual projects yield no exploitable product. Most industrial companies get 40% revenues only.[citation needed] On a technical level, high tech organizations explore ways to re-purpose and repackage advanced technologies as a way of amortizing the high overhead.[citation needed] They often reuse advanced manufacturing processes, expensive safety certifications, specialized embedded software, computer-aided design software, electronic designs and mechanical subsystems.[citation needed] Research from 2000 has shown that firms with a persistent R&D strategy outperform those with an irregular or no R&D investment program.[11] Business R&D[edit] Mercedes Benz Research Development North America (13896037060) Research and development are very difficult to manage, since the defining feature of research is that the researchers do not know in advance exactly how to accomplish the desired result. As a result, ""higher R&D spending does not guarantee more creativity, higher profit or a greater market share"".[12] Research is the most risky financing area because both the development of an invention and its successful realization carries uncertainty including the profitability of the invention.[13] One way entrepreneurs can reduce these uncertainties is to buy the licence for a franchise, so that the know-how is already incorporated in the licence.[14] Benefit by sector[edit] In general, it has been found that there is a positive correlation between the research and development and firm productivity across all sectors, but that this positive correlation is much stronger in high-tech firms than in low-tech firms.[15][16] In research done by Francesco Crespi and Cristiano Antonelli, high-tech firms were found to have ""virtuous"" Matthew effects while low-tech firms experienced ""vicious"" Matthew effects, meaning that high-tech firms were awarded subsidies on merit while low-tech firms most often were given subsidies based on name recognition, even if not put to good use.[17] While the strength of the correlation between R&D spending and productivity in low-tech industries is less than in high-tech industries, studies have been done showing non-trivial carryover effects to other parts of the marketplace by low-tech R&D.[18] Risks[edit] Business R&D is risky for at least two reasons. The first source of risks comes from R&D nature, where R&D project could fail without residual values. The second source of risks comes from takeover risks, which means R&D is appealing to bidders because they could gain technologies from acquisition targets.[19] Therefore, firms may gain R&D profit that co-moves with takeover waves, causing risks to the company which engages in R&D activity.[20] Global[edit] Global R&D management is the discipline of designing and leading R&D processes globally, across cultural and lingual settings, and the transfer of knowledge across international corporate networks.[21] Government expenditures[edit] Further information: Public research and development United States[edit] Mercedes Benz Research Development North America (13896049248) President Barack Obama requested $147.696 billion for research and development in FY2012, 21% of which was destined to fund basic research.[22] According to National Science Foundation in U.S., in 2015, R&D expenditures performed by federal government and local governments are 54 and 0.6 billions of dollars.[23] The federal research and development budget for fiscal year 2020 was $156 billion, 41.4% of which was for the Department of Defense (DOD).[24] DOD's total research, development, test, and evaluation budget was roughly $108.5 billion.[25] European Union[edit] Research and innovation in Europe are financially supported by the programme Horizon 2020, which is open to participation worldwide.[26] A notable example is the European environmental research and innovation policy, based on the Europe 2020 strategy which will run from 2014 to 2020,[27] a multidisciplinary effort to provide safe, economically feasible, environmentally sound and socially acceptable solutions along the entire value chain of human activities.[28] Worldwide[edit] In 2015, research and development constituted an average 2.2% of the global GDP according to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics.[29] See also[edit] Basic research Demonstration Industrial laboratory Innovation List of business and finance abbreviations List of companies by research and development spending List of countries by research and development spending Neglected Tropical Disease Research and Development Prototype Science of science policy Science policy Technological revolution Technology life cycle References[edit] ^ a b c Staff, Investopedia (2003-11-25).

The main island of Taiwan has an area of 35,808 square kilometres (13,826 sq mi), with mountain ranges dominating the eastern two-thirds and plains in the western third, where its highly urbanised population is concentrated. The capital is Taipei, which, along with New Taipei and Keelung, forms the largest metropolitan area of Taiwan. Other major cities include Kaohsiung, Taichung, Tainan and Taoyuan. With 23.57 million inhabitants, Taiwan is among the most densely populated countries in the world. Austronesian-speaking ancestors of Taiwanese indigenous peoples settled the island around 6,000 years ago. In the 17th century, large-scale Han Chinese immigration to western Taiwan began under a Dutch colony and continued under the Kingdom of Tungning. The island was annexed in 1683 by the Qing dynasty of China, and ceded to the Empire of Japan in 1895. The Republic of China, which had overthrown the Qing in 1911, took control of Taiwan on behalf of the World War II Allies following the surrender of Japan in 1945. The resumption of the Chinese Civil War resulted in the ROC's loss of mainland China to forces of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and retreat to Taiwan in 1949. Its effective jurisdiction has since been limited to Taiwan and numerous smaller islands. In the early 1960s, Taiwan entered a period of rapid economic growth and industrialisation called the ""Taiwan Miracle"". In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the ROC transitioned from a one-party military dictatorship to a multi-party democracy with a semi-presidential system. Taiwan's export-oriented industrial economy is the 21st-largest in the world by nominal GDP, and 20th-largest by PPP measures, with major contributions from steel, machinery, electronics and chemicals manufacturing. Taiwan is a developed country,[23][24] ranking 15th in GDP per capita. It is ranked highly in terms of political and civil liberties,[25] education, health care[26] and human development.[i][30] The political status of Taiwan is contentious. The ROC no longer represents China as a member of the United Nations, after UN members voted in 1971 to recognize the PRC instead. Meanwhile, the ROC continued to claim to be the legitimate representative of China and its territory, although this has been downplayed since its democratization in the 1990s. Taiwan is claimed by the PRC, which refuses diplomatic relations with countries that recognise the ROC. Taiwan maintains official diplomatic relations with 14 out of 193 UN member states and the Holy See,[31][32] though many others maintain unofficial diplomatic ties with Taiwan through representative offices and institutions that function as de facto embassies and consulates. International organisations in which the PRC participates either refuse to grant membership to Taiwan or allow it to participate only on a non-state basis under various names. Domestically, the major political contention is between parties favouring eventual Chinese unification and promoting a pan-Chinese identity contrasted with those aspiring to formal international recognition and promoting a Taiwanese identity, although both sides have moderated their positions to broaden their appeal.[33][34] Contents 1 Name 2 History 2.1 Early settlement (to 1683) 2.2 Qing rule (1683–1895) 2.3 Japanese rule (1895–1945) 2.4 Republic of China (1912–1949) 2.5 Republic of China on Taiwan (1949–present) 2.5.1 Martial law era (1949–1987) 2.5.2 Post-martial law era (1987–present) 3 Geography 3.1 Climate 3.2 Geology 4 Political and legal status 4.1 Relations with the PRC 4.2 Foreign relations 4.3 Participation in international events and organizations 4.4 Domestic opinion 5 Government and politics 5.1 Constitution 5.2 Major camps 5.3 National identity 5.4 Administrative divisions 6 Military 7 Economy 8 Transport 9 Education 10 Demographics 10.1 Largest cities and counties 10.2 Ethnic groups 10.3 Languages 10.4 Religion 10.5 LGBT 11 Public health 12 Culture 12.1 Arts 12.2 Popular culture 12.3 Sports 12.4 Calendar 13 See also 14 Notes 14.1 Words in native languages 15 References 15.1 Citations 15.2 Works cited 16 Further reading 17 External links 17.1 Overviews and data 17.2 Government agencies Name See also: Chinese Taipei, Names of China, and China and the United Nations Various names for the island of Taiwan remain in use, each derived from explorers or rulers during a particular historical period. The name Formosa (福爾摩沙) dates from 1542, when Portuguese sailors sighted an uncharted island and noted it on their maps as Ilha Formosa (""beautiful island"").[35][36] The name Formosa eventually ""replaced all others in European literature""[attribution needed][37] and remained in common use among English speakers into the 20th century.[38] In the early 17th century, the Dutch East India Company established a commercial post at Fort Zeelandia (modern-day Anping, Tainan) on a coastal sandbar called ""Tayouan"",[39] after their ethnonym for a nearby Taiwanese aboriginal tribe, possibly Taivoan people, written by the Dutch and Portuguese variously as Taiouwang, Tayowan, Teijoan, etc.[40] This name was also adopted into the Chinese vernacular (in particular, Hokkien, as Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Tāi-oân/Tâi-oân) as the name of the sandbar and nearby area (Tainan). The modern word ""Taiwan"" is derived from this usage, which is written in different transliterations (大員, 大圓, 大灣, 臺員, 臺圓 and 臺窩灣) in Chinese historical records. The area occupied by modern-day Tainan was the first permanent settlement by both European colonists and Chinese immigrants. The settlement grew to be the island's most important trading centre and served as its capital until 1887. Use of the current Chinese name (臺灣/台灣) became official as early as 1684 with the establishment of Taiwan Prefecture which centred in modern-day Tainan. Through its rapid development the entire Formosan mainland eventually became known as ""Taiwan"".[41][42][43][44] In his Daoyi Zhilüe (1349), Wang Dayuan used ""Liuqiu"" as a name for the island of Taiwan, or the part of it closest to Penghu.[45] Elsewhere, the name was used for the Ryukyu Islands in general or Okinawa, the largest of them; indeed the name Ryūkyū is the Japanese form of Liúqiú. The name also appears in the Book of Sui (636) and other early works, but scholars cannot agree on whether these references are to the Ryukyus, Taiwan or even Luzon.[46] The official name of the country is the ""Republic of China""; it has also been known under various names throughout its existence. Shortly after the ROC's establishment in 1912, while it was still located on the Chinese mainland, the government used the short form ""China"" (Zhōngguó (中國)) to refer to itself, which derives from zhōng (""central"" or ""middle"") and guó (""state, nation-state""),[j] a term which also developed under the Zhou dynasty in reference to its royal demesne,[k] and the name was then applied to the area around Luoyi (present-day Luoyang) during the Eastern Zhou and then to China's Central Plain before being used as an occasional synonym for the state during the Qing era.[48] During the 1950s and 1960s, after the government had withdrawn to Taiwan upon losing the Chinese Civil War, it was commonly referred to as ""Nationalist China"" (or ""Free China"") to differentiate it from ""Communist China"" (or ""Red China"").[50] It was a member of the United Nations representing ""China"" until 1971, when it lost its seat to the People's Republic of China. Over subsequent decades, the Republic of China has become commonly known as ""Taiwan"", after the island that comprises 99 per cent of the territory under its control. In some contexts, especially ROC government publications, the name is written as ""Republic of China (Taiwan)"", ""Republic of China/Taiwan"", or sometimes ""Taiwan (ROC)"".[51][52][53] The Republic of China participates in most international forums and organizations under the name ""Chinese Taipei"" due to diplomatic pressure from the People's Republic of China. For instance, it is the name under which it has competed at the Olympic Games since 1984, and its name as an observer at the World Health Organization.[54] History Main articles: History of Taiwan and History of the Republic of China See the History of China article for historical information in mainland China before 1949. Early settlement (to 1683) Main articles: Prehistory of Taiwan, Dutch Formosa, Spanish Formosa, Kingdom of Middag, and Kingdom of Tungning A young Tsou man Taiwan was joined to the Asian mainland in the Late Pleistocene, until sea levels rose about 10,000 years ago.[55] Fragmentary human remains dated 20,000 to 30,000 years ago have been found on the island, as well as later artifacts of a paleolithic culture.[56][57][58] Around 6,000 years ago, Taiwan was settled by farmers, most likely from what is now southeast China.[59] They are believed to be the ancestors of today's Taiwanese indigenous peoples, whose languages belong to the Austronesian language family, but show much greater diversity than the rest of the family, which spans a huge area from Maritime Southeast Asia west to Madagascar and east as far as New Zealand, Hawaii and Easter Island. This has led linguists to propose Taiwan as the urheimat of the family, from which seafaring peoples dispersed across Southeast Asia and the Pacific and Indian Oceans.[60][61] Han Chinese fishermen began settling in the Penghu islands in the 13th century.[62] Hostile tribes, and a lack of valuable trade products, meant that few outsiders visited the main island until the 16th century.[62] During the 16th century, visits to the coast by fishermen and traders from Fujian, as well as Chinese and Japanese pirates, became more frequent.[62] The Dutch East India Company attempted to establish a trading outpost on the Penghu Islands (Pescadores) in 1622, but was driven off by Ming forces.[63] In 1624, the company established a stronghold called Fort Zeelandia on the coastal islet of Tayouan, which is now part of the main island at Anping, Tainan.[44] When the Dutch arrived, they found southwestern Taiwan already frequented by a mostly-transient Chinese population numbering close to 1,500.[64] David Wright, a Scottish agent of the company who lived on the island in the 1650s, described the lowland areas of the island as being divided among 11 chiefdoms ranging in size from two settlements to 72. Some of these fell under Dutch control, including the Kingdom of Middag in the central western plains, while others remained independent.[44][65] The Company encouraged farmers to immigrate from Fujian and work the lands under Dutch control.[66] By the 1660s, some 30,000 to 50,000 Chinese were living on the island.[67] Fort Zeelandia, the Governor's residence in Dutch Formosa In 1626, the Spanish Empire landed on and occupied northern Taiwan as a trading base, first at Keelung and in 1628 building Fort San Domingo at Tamsui.[68] This colony lasted 16 years until 1642, when the last Spanish fortress fell to Dutch forces.[69] The Dutch then marched south, subduing hundreds of villages in the western plains between their new possessions in the north and their base at Tayouan.[69] Following the fall of the Ming dynasty in Beijing in 1644, Koxinga (Zheng Chenggong) pledged allegiance to the Yongli Emperor of Southern Ming and attacked the Qing dynasty along the southeastern coast of China.[70] In 1661, under increasing Qing pressure, he moved his forces from his base in Xiamen to Taiwan, expelling the Dutch in the following year. Some analysts consider his regime to be loyal to the Ming, while others argue that he acted as an independent ruler and his intentions were unclear.[71][72][73] After being ousted from Taiwan, the Dutch allied with the new Qing dynasty in China against the Zheng regime in Taiwan. Following some skirmishes the Dutch retook the northern fortress at Keelung in 1664.[74] Zheng Jing sent troops to dislodge the Dutch, but they were unsuccessful. The Dutch held out at Keelung until 1668, when aborigine resistance,[75] and the lack of progress in retaking any other parts of the island persuaded the colonial authorities to abandon this final stronghold and withdraw from Taiwan altogether.[76] Qing rule (1683–1895) Main article: Taiwan under Qing rule Hunting deer, painted in 1746 In 1683, following the defeat of Koxinga's grandson by an armada led by Admiral Shi Lang of southern Fujian, the Qing dynasty formally annexed Taiwan, placing it under the jurisdiction of Fujian province. The Qing imperial government tried to reduce piracy and vagrancy in the area, issuing a series of edicts to manage immigration and respect aboriginal land rights. Immigrants mostly from southern Fujian continued to enter Taiwan. The border between taxpaying lands and what was considered ""savage"" lands shifted eastward, with some aborigines becoming sinicized while others retreated into the mountains. During this time, there were a number of conflicts between different ethnic groups of Han Chinese, Quanzhou Minnanese feuding with Zhangzhou and Hakkas peasants, and major clan fights between Minnans (Hoklos), Hakkas and aborigines too. There were more than a hundred rebellions, riots, and instances of civil strife during the Qing's administration, including the Lin Shuangwen rebellion (1786–1788). Their frequency was evoked by the common saying ""every three years an uprising, every five years a rebellion"" (三年一反、五年一亂), primarily in reference to the period between 1820 and 1850.[77][78][79] Northern Taiwan and the Penghu Islands were the scene of subsidiary campaigns in the Sino-French War (August 1884 to April 1885). The French occupied Keelung on 1 October 1884, but were repulsed from Tamsui a few days later. The French won some tactical victories but were unable to exploit them, and the Keelung Campaign ended in stalemate. The Pescadores Campaign, beginning on 31 March 1885, was a French victory, but had no long-term consequences. The French evacuated both Keelung and the Penghu archipelago after the end of the war. In 1887, the Qing upgraded the island's administration from being the Taiwan Prefecture of Fujian Province to Fujian-Taiwan-Province, the twentieth in the empire, with its capital at Taipei. This was accompanied by a modernization drive that included building China's first railway.[80] Japanese rule (1895–1945) Main article: Taiwan under Japanese rule Japanese colonial soldiers march Taiwanese captured after the Tapani Incident in 1915 from the Tainan jail to court. Following Qing's defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), Taiwan, its associated islands, and the Penghu archipelago were ceded to the Empire of Japan by the Treaty of Shimonoseki, along with other concessions.[81] Inhabitants on Taiwan and Penghu wishing to remain Qing subjects were given a two-year grace period to sell their property and move to mainland China. Very few Taiwanese saw this as feasible.[82] On 25 May 1895, a group of pro-Qing high officials proclaimed the Republic of Formosa to resist impending Japanese rule. Japanese forces entered the capital at Tainan and quelled this resistance on 21 October 1895.[83] Guerrilla fighting continued periodically until about 1902 and ultimately took the lives of 14,000 Taiwanese, or 0.5 per cent of the population.[84] Several subsequent rebellions against the Japanese (the Beipu uprising of 1907, the Tapani incident of 1915, and the Musha incident of 1930) were all unsuccessful but demonstrated opposition to Japanese colonial rule. Japanese colonial rule was instrumental in the industrialization of the island, extending the railways and other transport networks, building an extensive sanitation system, and establishing a formal education system in Taiwan.[85] Japanese rule ended the practice of headhunting.[86] During this period the human and natural resources of Taiwan were used to aid the development of Japan, and the production of cash crops such as rice and sugar greatly increased. By 1939, Taiwan was the seventh-greatest sugar producer in the world.[87] Still, the Taiwanese and aborigines were classified as second- and third-class citizens. After suppressing Chinese guerrillas in the first decade of their rule, Japanese authorities engaged in a series of bloody campaigns against the mountain aboriginals, culminating in the Musha Incident of 1930.[88] Intellectuals and labourers who participated in left-wing movements within Taiwan were also arrested and massacred (e.g. Chiang Wei-shui and Masanosuke Watanabe).[89] Around 1935, the Japanese began an island-wide assimilation project to bind the island more firmly to the Japanese Empire and people were taught to see themselves as Japanese under the Kominka Movement, during which time Taiwanese culture and religion were outlawed and the citizens were encouraged to adopt Japanese surnames.[90] By 1938, 309,000 Japanese settlers resided in Taiwan.[91] Taiwan held strategic wartime importance as Imperial Japanese military campaigns first expanded and then contracted over the course of World War II. The ""South Strike Group"" was based at the Taihoku Imperial University in Taipei. During World War II, tens of thousands of Taiwanese served in the Japanese military.[92] Over 2,000 women, euphemistically called ""comfort women"", were forced into sexual slavery for Imperial Japanese troops.[93] The Imperial Japanese Navy operated heavily from Taiwanese ports. In October 1944 the Formosa Air Battle was fought between American carriers and Japanese forces based in Taiwan. Important Japanese military bases and industrial centres throughout Taiwan, such as Kaohsiung and Keelung, were targets of heavy raids by American bombers.[94] After Japan's surrender ended World War II, most of Taiwan's approximately 300,000 Japanese residents were expelled and sent to Japan.[95] Republic of China (1912–1949) Main article: Republic of China (1912–1949) General Chen Yi (right) accepting the receipt of General Order No. 1 from Rikichi Andō (left), the last Japanese Governor-General of Taiwan, in Taipei City Hall While Taiwan was still under Japanese rule, the Republic of China was founded on the mainland on 1 January 1912, following the Xinhai Revolution, which began with the Wuchang uprising on 10 October 1911, replacing the Qing dynasty and ending over two thousand years of imperial rule in China.[96] From its founding until 1949 it was based in mainland China. Central authority waxed and waned in response to warlordism (1915–28), Japanese invasion (1937–45), and the Chinese Civil War (1927–50), with central authority strongest during the Nanjing decade (1927–37), when most of China came under the control of the Kuomintang (KMT) under an authoritarian one-party state.[97] After the Surrender of Japan on 25 October 1945, the US Navy ferried ROC troops to Taiwan to accept the formal surrender of Japanese military forces in Taipei on behalf of the Allied Powers, as part of General Order No. 1 for temporary military occupation. General Rikichi Andō, governor-general of Taiwan and commander-in-chief of all Japanese forces on the island, signed the receipt and handed it over to General Chen Yi of the ROC military to complete the official turnover. Chen Yi proclaimed that day to be ""Taiwan Retrocession Day"", but the Allies considered Taiwan and the Penghu Islands to be under military occupation and still under Japanese sovereignty until 1952, when the Treaty of San Francisco took effect.[98][99] Although the 1943 Cairo Declaration had envisaged returning these territories to China, it had no legal status as treaty, and also in the Treaty of San Francisco and Treaty of Taipei Japan renounced all claim to them without specifying to what country they were to be surrendered. This introduced the disputed sovereignty status of Taiwan and whether the ROC has sovereignty over Taiwan or only remaining over Kinmen and Matsu Islands. The ROC administration of Taiwan under Chen Yi was strained by increasing tensions between Taiwanese-born people and newly arrived mainlanders, which were compounded by economic woes, such as hyperinflation. Furthermore, cultural and linguistic conflicts between the two groups quickly led to the loss of popular support for the new government, while the mass movement led by the working committee of the Chinese Communist Party also aimed to bring down the Kuomintang government.[100][101] The shooting of a civilian on 28 February 1947 triggered island-wide unrest, which was suppressed with military force in what is now called the February 28 Incident. Mainstream estimates of the number killed range from 18,000 to 30,000. Those killed were mainly members of the Taiwanese elite.[102][103] The Nationalists' retreat to Taipei After the end of World War II, the Chinese Civil War resumed between the Chinese Nationalists (Kuomintang), led by Director-general Chiang Kai-shek, and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), led by CCP Chairman Mao Zedong. Throughout the months of 1949, a series of Chinese Communist offensives led to the capture of its capital Nanjing on 23 April and the subsequent defeat of the Nationalist army on the mainland, and the Communists founded the People's Republic of China on 1 October.[104] On 7 December 1949, after the loss of four capitals, Chiang evacuated his Nationalist government to Taiwan and made Taipei the temporary capital of the ROC (also called the ""wartime capital"" by Chiang Kai-shek).[105] Some 2 million people, consisting mainly of soldiers, members of the ruling Kuomintang and intellectual and business elites, were evacuated from mainland China to Taiwan at that time, adding to the earlier population of approximately six million. These people came to be known in Taiwan as 'Mainlanders' (Waishengren, 外省人). In addition, the ROC government took to Taipei many national treasures and much of China's gold reserves and foreign currency reserves.[106][107][108] After losing control of mainland China in 1949, the ROC retained control of Taiwan and Penghu (Taiwan, ROC), parts of Fujian (Fujian, ROC)—specifically Kinmen, Wuqiu (now part of Kinmen) and the Matsu Islands and two major islands in the South China Sea (within the Dongsha/Pratas and Nansha/Spratly island groups). These territories have remained under ROC governance until the present day. The ROC also briefly retained control of the entirety of Hainan (an island province), parts of Zhejiang (Chekiang)—specifically the Dachen Islands and Yijiangshan Islands—and portions of the Tibet Autonomous Region (Tibet was de facto independent from 1912 to 1951), Qinghai, Xinjiang (Sinkiang) and Yunnan. The Communists captured Hainan in 1950, captured the Dachen Islands and Yijiangshan Islands during the First Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1955 and defeated the ROC revolts in Northwest China in 1958. ROC forces in Yunnan province entered Burma and Thailand in the 1950s and were defeated by Communists in 1961. Ever since losing control of mainland China, the Kuomintang continued to claim sovereignty over 'all of China', which it defined to include mainland China (including Tibet, which remained independent until 1951), Taiwan (including Penghu), Mongolia (known by the ROC as 'Outer Mongolia', 外蒙古) and other minor territories. In mainland China, the victorious Communists proclaimed the PRC to be the sole legitimate government of China (which included Taiwan, according to their definition) and that the Republic of China had been vanquished.[109] Republic of China on Taiwan (1949–present) Main articles: History of the Republic of China and History of Taiwan (1945–present) Martial law era (1949–1987) See also: Martial law in Taiwan and Taiwan Miracle Chiang Kai-shek, leader of the Kuomintang from 1925 until his death in 1975 Martial law, declared on Taiwan in May 1949,[110] continued to be in effect after the central government relocated to Taiwan. It was not repealed until 38 years later, in 1987.[110] Martial law was used as a way to suppress the political opposition during the years it was active.[111] During the White Terror, as the period is known, 140,000 people were imprisoned or executed for being perceived as anti-KMT or pro-Communist.[112] Many citizens were arrested, tortured, imprisoned and executed for their real or perceived link to the Chinese Communist Party. Since these people were mainly from the intellectual and social elite, an entire generation of political and social leaders was decimated. In 1998, a law was passed to create the ""Compensation Foundation for Improper Verdicts"" which oversaw compensation to White Terror victims and families. President Ma Ying-jeou made an official apology in 2008, expressing hope that there would never be a tragedy similar to White Terror.[113] Initially, the United States abandoned the KMT and expected that Taiwan would fall to the Communists. However, in 1950 the conflict between North Korea and South Korea, which had been ongoing since the Japanese withdrawal in 1945, escalated into full-blown war, and in the context of the Cold War, US President Harry S. Truman intervened again and dispatched the US Navy's 7th Fleet into the Taiwan Strait to prevent hostilities between Taiwan and mainland China.[114] In the Treaty of San Francisco and the Treaty of Taipei, which came into force respectively on 28 April 1952 and 5 August 1952, Japan formally renounced all right, claim and title to Taiwan and Penghu, and renounced all treaties signed with China before 1942. Neither treaty specified to whom sovereignty over the islands should be transferred, because the United States and the United Kingdom disagreed on whether the ROC or the PRC was the legitimate government of China.[115] Continuing conflict of the Chinese Civil War through the 1950s, and intervention by the United States notably resulted in legislation such as the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty and the Formosa Resolution of 1955. With Chiang Kai-shek, US president Dwight D. Eisenhower waved to crowds during his visit to Taipei in June 1960. As the Chinese Civil War continued without truce, the government built up military fortifications throughout Taiwan. Within this effort, KMT veterans built the now famous Central Cross-Island Highway through the Taroko Gorge in the 1950s. The two sides would continue to engage in sporadic military clashes with seldom publicized details well into the 1960s on the China coastal islands with an unknown number of night raids. During the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis in September 1958, Taiwan's landscape saw Nike-Hercules missile batteries added, with the formation of the 1st Missile Battalion Chinese Army that would not be deactivated until 1997. Newer generations of missile batteries have since replaced the Nike Hercules systems throughout the island. During the 1960s and 1970s, the ROC maintained an authoritarian, single-party government while its economy became industrialized and technology-oriented. This rapid economic growth, known as the Taiwan Miracle, was the result of a fiscal regime independent from mainland China and backed up, among others, by the support of US funds and demand for Taiwanese products.[116][117] In the 1970s, Taiwan was economically the second fastest growing state in Asia after Japan.[118] Taiwan, along with Hong Kong, South Korea and Singapore, became known as one of the Four Asian Tigers. Because of the Cold War, most Western nations and the United Nations regarded the ROC as the sole legitimate government of China until the 1970s. Later, especially after the termination of the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty, most nations switched diplomatic recognition to the PRC (see United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758). Until the 1970s the government was regarded by Western critics as undemocratic for upholding martial law, for severely repressing any political opposition, and for controlling media. The KMT did not allow the creation of new parties and those that existed did not seriously compete with the KMT. Thus, competitive democratic elections did not exist.[119][120][121][122][123] From the late 1970s to the 1990s, however, Taiwan went through reforms and social changes that transformed it from an authoritarian state to a democracy. In 1979, a pro-democracy protest known as the Kaohsiung Incident took place in Kaohsiung to celebrate Human Rights Day. Although the protest was rapidly crushed by the authorities, it is today considered as the main event that united Taiwan's opposition.[124] Chiang Ching-kuo, Chiang Kai-shek's son and successor as the ROC president and chairman of the KMT, began reforms to the political system in the mid-1980s. In 1984, the younger Chiang selected Lee Teng-hui, a Taiwanese-born, US-educated technocrat, to be his vice-president. In 1986, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) was formed and inaugurated as the first opposition party in the ROC to counter the KMT. A year later, Chiang Ching-kuo lifted martial law on the main island of Taiwan (martial law was lifted on Penghu in 1979, Matsu island in 1992 and Kinmen island in 1993). With the advent of democratization, the issue of the political status of Taiwan gradually resurfaced as a controversial issue where, previously, the discussion of anything other than unification under the ROC was taboo. Post-martial law era (1987–present) See also: Politics of the Republic of China In 1988, Lee Teng-hui became the first president of the Republic of China born in Taiwan and was the first to be democratically elected in 1996. After the death of Chiang Ching-kuo in January 1988, Lee Teng-hui succeeded him and became the first president born in Taiwan. Lee continued the democratic reforms to the government and decreased the concentration of government authority in the hands of mainland Chinese. Under Lee, Taiwan underwent a process of localization in which Taiwanese culture and history were promoted over a pan-China viewpoint in contrast to earlier KMT policies which had promoted a Chinese identity. Lee's reforms included printing banknotes from the Central Bank rather than the Provincial Bank of Taiwan, and streamlining the Taiwan Provincial Government with most of its functions transferred to the Executive Yuan. Under Lee, the original members of the Legislative Yuan and National Assembly (a former supreme legislative body defunct in 2005),[125] elected in 1947 to represent mainland Chinese constituencies and having held the seats without re-election for more than four decades, were forced to resign in 1991. The previously nominal representation in the Legislative Yuan was brought to an end, reflecting the reality that the ROC had no jurisdiction over mainland China, and vice versa. Restrictions on the use of Taiwanese Hokkien in the broadcast media and in schools were also lifted.[126] Reforms continued in the 1990s. The Additional Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China and the Act Governing Relations between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area defined the status of the ROC, making Taiwan its de facto territory. Lee Teng-hui re-elected in 1996, in the first direct presidential election in the history of the ROC.[127] During the later years of Lee's administration, he was involved in corruption controversies relating to government release of land and weapons purchase, although no legal proceedings commenced. In 1997, ""To meet the requisites of the nation prior to national unification"",[128] the Additional Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China was passed and then the former ""constitution of five powers"" turns to be more tripartite. In 2000, Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party was elected as the first non-Kuomintang (KMT) President and was re-elected to serve his second and last term since 2004. Polarized politics emerged in Taiwan with the formation of the Pan-Blue Coalition, led by the KMT, and the Pan-Green Coalition, led by the DPP. The former prefers eventual Chinese unification, while the latter prefers Taiwanese independence.[129] In early 2006, President Chen Shui-bian remarked: ""The National Unification Council will cease to function. No budget will be ear-marked for it and its personnel must return to their original posts...The National Unification Guidelines will cease to apply.""[130] The ruling DPP has traditionally leaned in favour of Taiwan independence. On 30 September 2007, the ruling DPP approved a resolution asserting a separate identity from China and called for the enactment of a new constitution for a ""normal country"". It also called for general use of ""Taiwan"" as the country's name, without abolishing its formal name, the Republic of China.[131] The Chen administration also pushed for referendums on cross-Strait relations in 2004 and UN entry in 2008, both of which held on the same day as the presidential election. They both failed due to voter turnout below the required legal threshold of 50 per cent of all registered voters.[132] The Chen administration was dogged by public concerns over reduced economic growth, legislative gridlock due to a pan-blue, opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan and corruption involving the First Family as well as government officials.[133][134] Following revelations that lead to an investigation of Chen Shui-bian for corruption charges, the KMT was able to increase its majority in the Legislative Yuan in the January 2008 legislative elections, while its nominee Ma Ying-jeou went on to win the presidency in March of the same year, campaigning on a platform of increased economic growth and better ties with the PRC under a policy of ""mutual non-denial"".[132] Under Ma, Taiwan and China opened up direct flights and cargo shipments, with the latter country even making it possible for Taiwan to participate in the annual World Health Assembly. Threats from China faded from the public's mind, although U.S. analysts Richard Fisher and Richard Bush argued that military tensions with the PRC had not been reduced.[135] Student protest in Taipei against a controversial trade agreement with China in March 2014 In 2014, the a group of university students successfully occupied the Legislative Yuan and prevented the ratification of the Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement in what became known as the Sunflower Student Movement. The movement gave rise to youth-based third parties such as the New Power Party, and is viewed to have contributed to Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) victories the 2016 presidential and legislative elections.[136] This marked the first time in Taiwanese history that the KMT lost its legislative majority. In 2016, Tsai Ing-wen of the DPP became the president of Taiwan. In 2020, she called on the international community to defend the self-ruled island's democracy in the face of renewed threats from China and called on the latter to democratize and renounce the use of military force against Taiwan. Chinese leader Xi Jinping had earlier expressed that Taiwan was part of China, who reserves the right to use force but will strive to achieve peaceful ""reunification"". Xi also offered to discuss unification with parties or individuals under the precondition of ""one China"", but both Tsai and the KMT rejected Xi's proposal.[137][138] In January 2020, Tsai was re-elected and in the simultaneous legislative election President Tsai's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) won a majority with 61 out of 113 seats. The Kuomintang (KMT) got 38 seats.[139] In the 2020 Democracy Index published in 2021, Taiwan was one of ""three countries [in Asia]"" that ""moved from the 'flawed democracy' category to be classified as 'full democracies'."" It ranks 11th globally as of 2021.[update][140][141] Geography Main article: Geography of Taiwan Taiwan is mostly mountainous in the east, with gently sloping plains in the west. The Penghu Islands are west of the main island. Taiwan is an island country in East Asia. The main island, known historically as Formosa, makes up 99 per cent of the area controlled by the ROC, measuring 35,808 square kilometres (13,826 sq mi) and lying some 180 kilometres (112 mi) across the Taiwan Strait from the southeastern coast of mainland China. The East China Sea lies to its north, the Philippine Sea to its east, the Luzon Strait directly to its south and the South China Sea to its southwest. Smaller islands include a number in the Taiwan Strait including the Penghu archipelago, the Kinmen and Matsu Islands near the Chinese coast, and some of the South China Sea Islands. The main island is a tilted fault block, characterized by the contrast between the eastern two-thirds, consisting mostly of five rugged mountain ranges parallel to the east coast, and the flat to gently rolling plains of the western third, where the majority of Taiwan's population reside. There are several peaks over 3,500 m, the highest being Yu Shan at 3,952 m (12,966 ft), making Taiwan the world's fourth-highest island. The tectonic boundary that formed these ranges is still active, and the island experiences many earthquakes, a few of them highly destructive. There are also many active submarine volcanoes in the Taiwan Straits. Taiwan contains four terrestrial ecoregions: Jian Nan subtropical evergreen forests, South China Sea Islands, South Taiwan monsoon rain forests, and Taiwan subtropical evergreen forests.[142] The eastern mountains are heavily forested and home to a diverse range of wildlife, while land use in the western and northern lowlands is intensive. The country had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 6.38/10, ranking it 76th globally out of 172 countries.[143] Climate Köppen climate classification of Taiwan Taiwan lies on the Tropic of Cancer, and its general climate is marine tropical.[12] The northern and central regions are subtropical, whereas the south is tropical and the mountainous regions are temperate.[144] The average rainfall is 2,600 millimetres (100 inches) per year for the island proper; the rainy season is concurrent with the onset of the summer East Asian Monsoon in May and June.[145] The entire island experiences hot, humid weather from June through September. Typhoons are most common in July, August and September.[145] During the winter (November to March), the northeast experiences steady rain, while the central and southern parts of the island are mostly sunny. Due to climate change, the average temperature in Taiwan has risen 1.4 °C (2.5 °F) in the last 100 years, which is twice of the worldwide temperature rise.[146] The goal of the Taiwanese government is to cut carbon emissions by 20 per cent in 2030 compared to 2005 levels, and by 50 per cent in 2050 compared to 2005 levels. Carbon emissions increased by 0.92 per cent between 2005 and 2016.[147] Geology Main article: Geology of Taiwan Dabajian Mountain The island of Taiwan lies in a complex tectonic area between the Yangtze Plate to the west and north, the Okinawa Plate on the north-east, and the Philippine Mobile Belt on the east and south. The upper part of the crust on the island is primarily made up of a series of terranes, mostly old island arcs which have been forced together by the collision of the forerunners of the Eurasian Plate and the Philippine Sea Plate. These have been further uplifted as a result of the detachment of a portion of the Eurasian Plate as it was subducted beneath remnants of the Philippine Sea Plate, a process which left the crust under Taiwan more buoyant.[148] The east and south of Taiwan are a complex system of belts formed by, and part of the zone of, active collision between the North Luzon Trough portion of the Luzon Volcanic Arc and South China, where accreted portions of the Luzon Arc and Luzon forearc form the eastern Coastal Range and parallel inland Longitudinal Valley of Taiwan, respectively.[149] The major seismic faults in Taiwan correspond to the various suture zones between the various terranes. These have produced major quakes throughout the history of the island. On 21 September 1999, a 7.3 quake known as the ""921 earthquake"" killed more than 2,400 people. The seismic hazard map for Taiwan by the USGS shows 9/10 of the island at the highest rating (most hazardous).[150] Political and legal status Main article: Political status of Taiwan See also: List of states with limited recognition and Foreign relations of China § International territorial disputes The political and legal statuses of Taiwan are contentious issues. The People's Republic of China (PRC) claims that the Republic of China government is illegitimate, referring to it as the ""Taiwan Authority"".[151][152] The ROC has its own currency, widely accepted passport, postage stamps, internet TLD, armed forces and constitution with an independently elected president. It has not formally renounced its claim to the mainland, but ROC government publications have increasingly downplayed this historical claim.[153] Internationally, there is controversy[citation needed] on whether the ROC still exists as a state or a defunct state per international law due to the lack of wide diplomatic recognition. Though it was a founding member of United Nations, the ROC now has neither official membership nor observer status in the organization. Broadly speaking, domestic public opinion has preferred the status quo, with a moderate increase in pro-independence sentiment since democratization. In 2020, an annual poll run by National Chengchi University found that 52.3 per cent of respondents preferred postponing a decision or maintaining the status quo indefinitely, 35.1 per cent of respondents preferred eventual or immediate independence, and 5.8 per cent preferred eventual or immediate unification.[154] Relations with the PRC See also: Cross-Strait relations 2015 Ma–Xi meeting The political environment is complicated by the potential for military conflict should Taiwan declare de jure independence. It is the official PRC policy to force unification if peaceful unification is no longer possible, as stated in its anti-secession law, and for this reason there is a substantial military presence on the Fujian coast.[155][156][157][158] For almost 60 years, there were no direct transportation links, including direct flights, between Taiwan and the PRC. This was a problem for many Taiwanese businesses that had opened factories or branches in mainland China. The former DPP administration feared that such links would lead to tighter economic and political integration with mainland China.[citation needed] In the 2006 Lunar New Year Speech, President Chen Shui-bian called for managed opening of links. Direct weekend charter flights between Taiwan and mainland China began in July 2008 under the KMT government, and the first direct daily charter flights took off in December 2008.[159] On 29 April 2005, Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan travelled to Beijing and met with Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Hu Jintao,[160] the first meeting between the leaders of the two parties since the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949. On 11 February 2014, Mainland Affairs Council head Wang Yu-chi travelled to Nanjing and met with Taiwan Affairs Office head Zhang Zhijun, the first meeting between high-ranking officials from either side.[161] Zhang paid a reciprocal visit to Taiwan and met Wang on 25 June 2014, making Zhang the first minister-level PRC official to ever visit Taiwan.[162] On 7 November 2015, Ma Ying-jeou (in his capacity as Leader of Taiwan) and Xi Jinping (in his capacity as leader of Mainland China[163]) travelled to Singapore and met up,[164] marking the highest-level exchange between the two sides since 1945.[165] In response to US support for Taiwan, the PRC defense ministry declared in 2019 that ""If anyone dares to split Taiwan from China, the Chinese military has no choice but to fight at all costs"".[166] The PRC supports a version of the One-China policy, which states that Taiwan and mainland China are both part of China, and that the PRC is the only legitimate government of China. It uses this policy to prevent the international recognition of the ROC as an independent sovereign state, meaning that Taiwan participates in international forums under the name ""Chinese Taipei"". It is the official policy of the PRC to promote reunification but employ non-peaceful means in the event of Taiwan seccession or if peaceful unification is no longer possible.[167][137][168] With the emergence of the Taiwanese independence movement, the name ""Taiwan"" has been used increasingly often on the island.[169] President Tsai Ing-wen has supported the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests and expressed her solidarity with the people of Hong Kong. Tsai pledged that as long as she is Taiwan's president, she will never accept ""one country, two systems"".[170] Foreign relations Main article: Foreign relations of Taiwan Countries maintaining relations with the ROC  diplomatic relations and embassy in Taipei   unofficial relations (see text) Before 1928, the foreign policy of Republican China was complicated by a lack of internal unity—competing centres of power all claimed legitimacy. This situation changed after the defeat of the Peiyang Government by the Kuomintang, which led to widespread diplomatic recognition of the Republic of China.[171] After the KMT's retreat to Taiwan, most countries, notably the countries in the Western Bloc, continued to maintain relations with the ROC. Due to diplomatic pressure, recognition gradually eroded and many countries switched recognition to the PRC in the 1970s. UN Resolution 2758 (25 October 1971) recognized the People's Republic of China as China's sole representative in the United Nations.[172] ROC embassy in Eswatini The PRC refuses to have diplomatic relations with any nation that has diplomatic relations with the ROC, and requires all nations with which it has diplomatic relations to make a statement recognizing its claims to Taiwan.[173] As a result, only 14 UN member states and the Holy See maintain official diplomatic relations with the Republic of China.[31] The ROC maintains unofficial relations with most countries via de facto embassies and consulates called Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Offices (TECRO), with branch offices called ""Taipei Economic and Cultural Offices"" (TECO). Both TECRO and TECO are ""unofficial commercial entities"" of the ROC in charge of maintaining diplomatic relations, providing consular services (i.e. visa applications), and serving the national interests of the ROC in other countries.[174] From 1954 to 1979, the United States was a partner with Taiwan in a mutual defense treaty. The United States remains one of the main allies of Taiwan and, through the Taiwan Relations Act passed in 1979, has continued selling arms and providing military training to the Armed Forces.[175] This situation continues to be an issue for the People's Republic of China, which considers US involvement disruptive to the stability of the region. In January 2010, the Obama administration announced its intention to sell $6.4 billion worth of military hardware to Taiwan. As a consequence, the PRC threatened the US with economic sanctions and warned that their co-operation on international and regional issues could suffer.[176] The official position of the United States is that the PRC is expected to ""use no force or threat[en] to use force against Taiwan"" and the ROC is to ""exercise prudence in managing all aspects of Cross-Strait relations."" Both are to refrain from performing actions or espousing statements ""that would unilaterally alter Taiwan's status"".[177] On 16 December 2015, the Obama administration announced a deal to sell $1.83 billion worth of arms to the armed forces of the ROC.[178][179] The foreign ministry of the PRC had expressed its disapproval for the sales and issued the US a ""stern warning"", saying it would hurt PRC–US relations.[180] Participation in international events and organizations See also: Foreign relations of Taiwan § Relation with International organizations, and Chinese Taipei The ROC was a founding member of the United Nations, and held the seat of China on the Security Council and other UN bodies until 1971, when it was expelled by Resolution 2758 and replaced in all UN organs with the PRC. Each year since 1992, the ROC has petitioned the UN for entry, but its applications have not made it past committee stage.[181] The flag used by Taiwan at the Olympic Games, where it competes as ""Chinese Taipei"" (中華台北) Due to its limited international recognition, the Republic of China has been a member of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO) since the foundation of the organization in 1991, represented by a government-funded organization, the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy (TFD), under the name ""Taiwan"".[182][183] Also due to its One China policy, the PRC only participates in international organizations where the ROC does not participate as a sovereign country. Most member states, including the United States, do not wish to discuss the issue of the ROC's political status for fear of souring diplomatic ties with the PRC.[184] However, both the US and Japan publicly support the ROC's bid for membership in the World Health Organization (WHO) as an observer.[185] However, though the ROC sought to participate in the WHO since 1997,[186][187] their efforts were blocked by the PRC until 2010, when they were invited as observers to attend the World Health Assembly, under the name ""Chinese Taipei"".[188] In 2017, Taiwan again began to be excluded from the WHO even in an observer capacity.[189] This exclusion caused a number of scandals during the COVID-19 outbreak.[190][191] Due to PRC pressure, the ROC has used the name ""Chinese Taipei"" in international events where the PRC is also a party (such as the Olympic Games) since the ROC, PRC, and International Olympic Committee came to an agreement in 1981.[192][193] The ROC is typically barred from using its national anthem and national flag in international events due to PRC pressure; ROC spectators attending events such as the Olympics are often barred from bringing ROC flags into venues.[194] Taiwan also participates in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (since 1991) and the World Trade Organization (since 2002) under the name ""Chinese Taipei"". The ROC was a founding member of the Asian Development Bank, but since China's ascension in 1986 has participated under the name ""Taipei,China"". The ROC is able to participate as ""China"" in organizations in which the PRC does not participate, such as the World Organization of the Scout Movement. A referendum question in 2018 asked if Taiwan should compete as ""Taiwan"" in the 2020 Summer Olympics, but failed after it was alleged that doing so could result in athletes being banned from competing entirely.[195] Domestic opinion See also: Taiwan independence and Chinese Unification Broadly speaking, domestic public opinion has preferred maintaining the status quo, though pro-independence sentiment has steadily risen since democratization, with a significant increase since 2018. In 2020, an annual poll run by National Chengchi University found that 28.5 per cent of respondents preferred postponing a decision, 25.5 per cent supported maintaining the status quo indefinitely, 35.1 per cent of respondents voted for eventual or immediate independence, and 5.8 per cent chose eventual or immediate unification. On the other hand, Taiwanese identity has seen a significant rise in the same poll since democratization: in 2020, 67 per cent of respondents identified as Taiwanese only, versus 27.5 per cent who identified as both Chinese and Taiwanese and 2.4 per cent who identified as Chinese.[154] The KMT, the largest Pan-Blue party, supports the status quo for the indefinite future with a stated ultimate goal of unification. However, it does not support unification in the short term with the PRC as such a prospect would be unacceptable to most of its members and the public.[196] Ma Ying-jeou, chairman of the KMT and former president of the ROC, has set out democracy, economic development to a level near that of Taiwan, and equitable wealth distribution as the conditions that the PRC must fulfill for reunification to occur.[197] The Democratic Progressive Party, the largest Pan-Green party, officially seeks independence, but in practice also supports the status quo because its members and the public would not accept the risk of provoking the PRC.[198][199] On 2 September 2008, Mexican newspaper El Sol de México asked President Ma of the Kuomintang about his views on the subject of ""two Chinas"" and if there was a solution for the sovereignty issues between the two. The president replied that the relations are neither between two Chinas nor two states. It is a special relationship. Further, he stated that the sovereignty issues between the two cannot be resolved at present, but he quoted the ""1992 Consensus"", currently[when?] accepted by both the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party, as a temporary measure until a solution becomes available.[200] On 27 September 2017, Taiwanese premier William Lai of the Democratic Progressive Party said that he was a ""political worker who advocates Taiwan independence"", but that as Taiwan was already an independent country called the Republic of China, it had no need to declare independence.[201] Government and politics Main articles: Government of the Republic of China and Politics of the Republic of China See also: Elections in Taiwan, Human rights in Taiwan, and North-South divide in Taiwan Taiwan's popularly elected president resides in the Presidential Office Building, Taipei, originally built in the Japanese era for colonial governors. The government of the Republic of China was founded on the 1947 Constitution of the ROC and its Three Principles of the People, which states that the ROC ""shall be a democratic republic of the people, to be governed by the people and for the people"".[202] It underwent significant revisions in the 1990s, known collectively as the Additional Articles. The government is divided into five branches (Yuan): the Executive Yuan (cabinet), the Legislative Yuan (Congress or Parliament), the Judicial Yuan, the Control Yuan (audit agency), and the Examination Yuan (civil service examination agency). Tsai Ing-wen, President of the Republic of China The head of state and commander-in-chief of the armed forces is the president, who is elected by popular vote for a maximum of 2 four-year terms on the same ticket as the vice-president. The president has authority over the Yuan. The president appoints the members of the Executive Yuan as their cabinet, including a premier, who is officially the President of the Executive Yuan; members are responsible for policy and administration.[202] The main legislative body is the unicameral Legislative Yuan with 113 seats. Seventy-three are elected by popular vote from single-member constituencies; thirty-four are elected based on the proportion of nationwide votes received by participating political parties in a separate party list ballot; and six are elected from two three-member aboriginal constituencies. Members serve four-year terms. Originally the unicameral National Assembly, as a standing constitutional convention and electoral college, held some parliamentary functions, but the National Assembly was abolished in 2005 with the power of constitutional amendments handed over to the Legislative Yuan and all eligible voters of the Republic via referendums.[202][203] Su Tseng-chang, Premier of the Republic of China The premier is selected by the president without the need for approval from the legislature, but the legislature can pass laws without regard for the president, as neither he nor the Premier wields veto power.[202] Thus, there is little incentive for the president and the legislature to negotiate on legislation if they are of opposing parties. After the election of the pan-Green's Chen Shui-bian as President in 2000, legislation repeatedly stalled because of deadlock with the Legislative Yuan, which was controlled by a pan-Blue majority.[204] Historically, the ROC has been dominated by strongman single party politics. This legacy has resulted in executive powers currently being concentrated in the office of the president rather than the premier, even though the constitution does not explicitly state the extent of the president's executive power.[205] The Judicial Yuan is the highest judicial organ. It interprets the constitution and other laws and decrees, judges administrative suits, and disciplines public functionaries. The president and vice-president of the Judicial Yuan and additional thirteen justices form the Council of Grand Justices.[206] They are nominated and appointed by the president, with the consent of the Legislative Yuan. The highest court, the Supreme Court, consists of a number of civil and criminal divisions, each of which is formed by a presiding judge and four associate judges, all appointed for life. In 1993, a separate constitutional court was established to resolve constitutional disputes, regulate the activities of political parties and accelerate the democratization process. There is no trial by jury but the right to a fair public trial is protected by law and respected in practice; many cases are presided over by multiple judges.[202] The Control Yuan is a watchdog agency that monitors (controls) the actions of the executive. It can be considered a standing commission for administrative inquiry and can be compared to the Court of Auditors of the European Union or the Government Accountability Office of the United States.[202] It is also responsible for the National Human Rights Commission. The Examination Yuan is in charge of validating the qualification of civil servants. It is based on the old imperial examination system used in dynastic China. It can be compared to the European Personnel Selection Office of the European Union or the Office of Personnel Management of the United States.[202] It was downsized in 2019, and there have been calls for its abolition.[207][208] Constitution The constitution was drafted in by the KMT while the ROC still governed the Chinese mainland, went into effect on 25 December 1947.[209] The ROC remained under martial law from 1948 until 1987 and much of the constitution was not in effect.[citation needed] Political reforms beginning in the late 1970s resulted in the end of martial law in 1987, and Taiwan transformed into a multiparty democracy in the early 1990s. The constitutional basis for this transition to democracy was gradually laid in the Additional Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China. In addition, these articles localized the Constitution by suspending portions of the Constitution designed for governance of China and replacing them with articles adapted for the governance of and guaranteeing the political rights of residents of the Taiwan Area, as defined in the Act Governing Relations between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area.[210] National boundaries were not explicitly prescribed by the 1947 Constitution, and the Constitutional Court declined to define these boundaries in a 1993 interpretation, viewing the question as a political question to be resolved by the Executive and Legislative Yuans.[211] The 1947 Constitution included articles regarding representatives from former Qing dynasty territories including Tibet and Mongolia (though it did not specify whether this excluded Outer Mongolia).[212][213] The ROC recognized Mongolia as an independent country in 1946 after signing the 1945 Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, but after retreating to Taiwan in 1949 it reneged on its agreement in order to preserve its claim over China.[214] The Additional Articles of the 1990s did not alter national boundaries, but suspended articles regarding Mongolian and Tibetan representatives. The ROC began to accept the Mongolian passport and removed clauses referring to Outer Mongolia from the Act Governing Relations between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area in 2002.[215] In 2012 the Mainland Affairs Council issued a statement clarifying that Outer Mongolia was not part of the ROC's national territory in 1947,[216] and that the termination of the Sino-Soviet Treaty had not altered national territory according to the Constitution.[217] The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission in the Executive Yuan was abolished in 2017. Major camps The Democratic Progressive Party, the main Pan-Green Coalition partyEmblem of the Kuomintang, the main Pan-Blue Coalition party Taiwan's political scene is divided into two major camps in terms of cross-Strait relations, i.e. how Taiwan should relate to China or the PRC. The Pan-Green Coalition (e.g. the Democratic Progressive Party) leans pro-independence, and the Pan-Blue Coalition (e.g. the Kuomintang) leans pro-unification. Moderates in both camps regard the Republic of China as a sovereign independent state, but the Pan-Green Coalition regard the ROC as synonymous with Taiwan, while moderates in the Pan-Blue Coalition view it as synonymous with China. These positions formed against the backdrop of the PRC's Anti-Secession Law, which threatens invasion in the event of formal independence. Taiwanese-born Tangwai (""independent"") politician Wu San-lien (second left) celebrates with supporters his landslide victory of 65.5 per cent in Taipei's first mayoral election in January 1951. The Pan-Green Coalition is composed of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party and Taiwan Statebuilding Party (TSP). They oppose the idea that Taiwan is part of China, and seeks wide diplomatic recognition and an eventual declaration of formal Taiwan independence.[218][failed verification] In September 2007, the then ruling Democratic Progressive Party approved a resolution asserting separate identity from China and called for the enactment of a new constitution for a ""normal country"". It called also for general use of ""Taiwan"" as the country's name, without abolishing its formal name, the ""Republic of China"".[219] Some members of the coalition, such as former President Chen Shui-bian, argue that it is unnecessary to proclaim independence because ""Taiwan is already an independent, sovereign country"" and the Republic of China is the same as Taiwan.[220] Despite being a member of KMT prior to and during his presidency, Lee Teng-hui also held a similar view and was a supporter of the Taiwanization movement.[221] The Pan-Blue Coalition, composed of the pro-unification Kuomintang, People First Party (PFP) and New Party generally support the spirit of the 1992 Consensus, where the KMT declared that there is one China, but that the ROC and PRC have different interpretations of what ""China"" means. They favour eventual re-unification of China.[222] The more mainstream Pan-Blue position is to lift investment restrictions and pursue negotiations with the PRC to immediately open direct transportation links. Regarding independence, the mainstream Pan-Blue position is to maintain the status quo, while refusing immediate reunification.[196] President Ma Ying-jeou stated that there will be no unification nor declaration of independence during his presidency.[223][224] As of 2009[update], Pan-Blue members usually seek to improve relationships with mainland China, with a current focus on improving economic ties.[225] National identity Main article: Taiwanese people § The current state of Taiwanese identity See also: Opinion polling on Taiwanese identity Results from an identity survey conducted each year since 1992 by the Election Study Center, National Chengchi University.[226] Responses are Taiwanese (green), Chinese (red) or Both Taiwanese and Chinese (hatched). Non-responses are shown as grey. Roughly 84 per cent of Taiwan's population are descendants of Han Chinese immigrants from Qing China between 1683 and 1895. Another significant fraction descends from Han Chinese who immigrated from mainland China in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The shared cultural origin combined with several hundred years of geographical separation, some hundred years of political separation and foreign influences, as well as hostility between the rival ROC and PRC have resulted in national identity being a contentious issue with political overtones. Since democratic reforms and the lifting of martial law, a distinct Taiwanese identity (as opposed to Taiwanese identity as a subset of a Chinese identity) is often at the heart of political debates. Its acceptance makes the island distinct from mainland China, and therefore may be seen as a step towards forming a consensus for de jure Taiwan independence.[227] The Pan-Green camp supports a predominantly Taiwanese identity (although ""Chinese"" may be viewed as cultural heritage), while the Pan-Blue camp supports a predominantly Chinese identity (with ""Taiwanese"" as a regional/diasporic Chinese identity).[222] The KMT has downplayed this stance in the recent years and now supports a Taiwanese identity as part of a Chinese identity.[228][229] In an annual poll conducted by National Chengchi University, Taiwanese identification has increased substantially since democratization in the early 1990s, while Chinese identification has fallen to a low level and identification as both has also seen a reduction. In 1992, 17.6 per cent of respondents identified as Taiwanese only, 25.5 per cent as Chinese only, 46.4 per cent as both, and 10.5 per cent declining to state. In 2020, 64.3 per cent identified as Taiwanese, 2.6 per cent as Chinese, 29.9 per cent as both, and 3.2 per cent declining.[226] A survey conducted in Taiwan in July 2009, showed that 82.8 per cent of respondents consider the ROC and the PRC as two separate countries with each developing on its own.[230] Administrative divisions Main article: Administrative divisions of Taiwan Taiwan is, in practice, divided into 22 subnational divisions, each with a self-governing body led by an elected leader and a legislative body with elected members. Duties of local governments include social services, education, urban planning, public construction, water management, environmental protection, transport, public safety, and more. There are three types of subnational divisions: special municipalities, counties, and cities. Special municipalities and cities are further divided into districts for local administration. Counties are further divided into townships and county-administered cities which have elected mayors and councils, and share duties with the county. Some divisions are indigenous divisions which have different degrees of autonomy to standard ones. In addition, districts, cities and townships are further divided into villages and neighbourhoods.

Military Main article: Republic of China Armed Forces See also: Republic of China Military Academy Republic of China Army Thunderbolt-2000 The Republic of China Army takes its roots in the National Revolutionary Army, which was established by Sun Yat-sen in 1925 in Guangdong with a goal of reunifying China under the Kuomintang. When the People's Liberation Army won the Chinese Civil War, much of the National Revolutionary Army retreated to Taiwan along with the government. It was later reformed into the Republic of China Army. Units which surrendered and remained in mainland China were either disbanded or incorporated into the People's Liberation Army. The ROC and the United States signed the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty in 1954, and established the United States Taiwan Defense Command. About 30,000 US troops were stationed in Taiwan, until the United States established diplomatic relations with the PRC in 1979.[231] Today, Taiwan maintains a large and technologically advanced military, mainly as a defence to the constant threat of invasion by the People's Liberation Army using the Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China as a pretext. This law authorizes the use of military force when certain conditions are met, such as a danger to mainlanders.[156] From 1949 to the 1970s, the primary mission of the Taiwanese military was to ""retake mainland China"" through Project National Glory. As this mission has transitioned away from attack because the relative strength of the PRC has massively increased, the ROC military has begun to shift emphasis from the traditionally dominant Army to the air force and navy. Republic of China Air Force indigenously produced fighter airplane in Ching Chuan Kang Air Base Control of the armed forces has also passed into the hands of the civilian government.[232][233] As the ROC military shares historical roots with the KMT, the older generation of high-ranking officers tends to have Pan-Blue sympathies. However, many have retired and there are many more non-mainlanders enlisting in the armed forces in the younger generations, so the political leanings of the military have moved closer to the public norm in Taiwan.[234] The ROC began a force reduction plan, Jingshi An (translated to streamlining program), to scale down its military from a level of 450,000 in 1997 to 380,000 in 2001.[235] As of 2009[update], the armed forces of the ROC number approximately 300,000,[236] with nominal reserves totalling 3.6 million as of 2015[update].[237] Conscription remains universal for qualified males reaching age eighteen, but as a part of the reduction effort many are given the opportunity to fulfill their draft requirement through alternative service and are redirected to government agencies or arms related industries.[238] Current plans call for a transition to a predominantly professional army over the next decade.[239][240] Conscription periods are planned to decrease from 14 months to 12.[241] In the last months of the Bush administration, Taipei took the decision to reverse the trend of declining military spending, at a time when most Asian countries kept on reducing their military expenditures. It also decided to strengthen both defensive and offensive capabilities. Taipei still keeps a large military apparatus relative to the island's population: military expenditures for 2008 were NTD 334 billion (approximately US $10.5 billion), which accounted for 2.94 per cent of GDP. The C-130H in Songshan AFB The armed forces' primary concern at this time, according to the National Defense Report, is the possibility of an invasion by the PRC, consisting of a naval blockade, airborne assault or missile bombardment.[232] Four upgraded Kidd-class destroyers were purchased from the United States, and commissioned into the Republic of China Navy in 2005–2006, significantly upgrading Taiwan's protection from aerial attack and submarine hunting abilities.[242] The Ministry of National Defense planned to purchase diesel-powered submarines and Patriot anti-missile batteries from the United States, but its budget has been stalled repeatedly by the opposition-Pan-Blue Coalition controlled legislature. The military package was stalled from 2001 to 2007 where it was finally passed through the legislature and the US responded on 3 October 2008, with a $6.5 billion arms package including PAC III Anti-Air systems, AH-64D Apache Attack helicopters and other arms and parts.[243] A significant amount of military hardware has been bought from the United States, and, as of 2009[update], continues to be legally guaranteed by the Taiwan Relations Act.[175] In the past, France and the Netherlands have also sold military weapons and hardware to the ROC, but they almost entirely stopped in the 1990s under pressure of the PRC.[244][245] The first line of protection against invasion by the PRC is the ROC's own armed forces. Current ROC military doctrine is to hold out against an invasion or blockade until the US military responds.[246] There is, however, no guarantee in the Taiwan Relations Act or any other treaty that the United States will defend Taiwan, even in the event of invasion.[247] The joint declaration on security between the US and Japan signed in 1996 may imply that Japan would be involved in any response. However, Japan has refused to stipulate whether the ""area surrounding Japan"" mentioned in the pact includes Taiwan, and the precise purpose of the pact is unclear.[248] The Australia, New Zealand, United States Security Treaty (ANZUS Treaty) may mean that other US allies, such as Australia, could theoretically be involved.[249] While this would risk damaging economic ties with China,[250] a conflict over Taiwan could lead to an economic blockade of China by a greater coalition.[251][252][253][254][255] Economy Main articles: Economy of Taiwan and Economic history of Taiwan Taipei 101 held the world record for skyscraper height from 2004 to 2010. The quick industrialization and rapid growth of Taiwan during the latter half of the 20th century has been called the ""Taiwan Miracle"". Taiwan is one of the ""Four Asian Tigers"" alongside Hong Kong, South Korea and Singapore. Japanese rule prior to and during World War II brought changes in the public and private sectors, most notably in the area of public works, which enabled rapid communications and facilitated transport throughout much of the island. The Japanese also improved public education and made it compulsory for all residents of Taiwan. By 1945, hyperinflation was in progress in mainland China and Taiwan as a result of the war with Japan. To isolate Taiwan from it, the Nationalist government created a new currency area for the island, and began a price stabilization programme. These efforts significantly slowed inflation. When the KMT government fled to Taiwan it brought millions of taels (where 1 tael = 37.5 g or ~1.2 ozt) of gold and the foreign currency reserve of mainland China, which, according to the KMT, stabilized prices and reduced hyperinflation.[256] Perhaps more importantly, as part of its retreat to Taiwan, the KMT brought the intellectual and business elites from mainland China.[257] The KMT government instituted many laws and land reforms that it had never effectively enacted on mainland China. The government also implemented a policy of import-substitution, attempting to produce imported goods domestically.[258] In 1950, with the outbreak of the Korean War, the United States began an aid programme which resulted in fully stabilized prices by 1952.[259] Economic development was encouraged by American economic aid and programmes such as the Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction, which turned the agricultural sector into the basis for later growth. Under the combined stimulus of the land reform and the agricultural development programmes, agricultural production increased at an average annual rate of 4 per cent from 1952 to 1959, which was greater than the population growth, 3.6 per cent.[260] In 1962, Taiwan had a (nominal) per-capita gross national product (GNP) of $170, placing its economy on a par with those of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. On a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis, its GDP per capita in the early 1960s was $1,353 (in 1990 prices). By 2011 per-capita GNP, adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP), had risen to $37,000, contributing to a Human Development Index (HDI) equivalent to that of other developed countries. Neihu Technology Park in Taipei In 1974, Chiang Ching-kuo implemented the Ten Major Construction Projects, the beginning foundations that helped Taiwan transform into its current export driven economy. Since the 1990s, a number of Taiwan-based technology firms have expanded their reach around the world. Well-known international technology companies headquartered in Taiwan include personal computer manufacturers Acer Inc. and Asus, mobile phone maker HTC, as well as electronics manufacturing giant Foxconn, which makes products for Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft. Computex Taipei is a major computer expo, held since 1981. Today Taiwan has a dynamic, capitalist, export-driven economy with gradually decreasing state involvement in investment and foreign trade. In keeping with this trend, some large government-owned banks and industrial firms are being privatized.[261] Real growth in GDP has averaged about 8 per cent during the past three decades. Exports have provided the primary impetus for industrialization. The trade surplus is substantial, and foreign reserves are the world's fifth largest.[262] The currency of Taiwan is the New Taiwan dollar. Since the beginning of the 1990s, the economic ties between Taiwan and the People's Republic of China have been very prolific. As of 2008[update], more than US$150 billion[263] have been invested in the PRC by Taiwanese companies. Although the economy of Taiwan benefits from this situation, some have expressed the view that the island has become increasingly dependent on the mainland Chinese economy. A 2008 white paper by the Department of Industrial Technology states that ""Taiwan should seek to maintain stable relation with China while continuing to protect national security, and avoiding excessive 'Sinicization' of Taiwanese economy.""[264] Others argue that close economic ties between Taiwan and mainland China would make any military intervention by the PLA against Taiwan very costly, and therefore less probable.[265] Taiwan's total trade in 2010 reached an all-time high of US$526.04 billion, according to Taiwan's Ministry of Finance. Both exports and imports for the year reached record levels, totalling US$274.64 billion and US$251.4 billion, respectively.[266] Rice paddy fields in Yilan County In 2001, agriculture constituted only 2 per cent of GDP, down from 35 per cent in 1952.[267] Traditional labour-intensive industries are steadily being moved offshore and with more capital and technology-intensive industries replacing them. High-technology industrial parks have sprung up in every region in Taiwan. The ROC has become a major foreign investor in the PRC, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Vietnam. It is estimated that some 50,000 Taiwanese businesses and 1,000,000 businesspeople and their dependents are established in the PRC.[268] Because of its conservative financial approach and its entrepreneurial strengths, Taiwan suffered little compared with many of its neighbours in the 1997 Asian financial crisis. Unlike its neighbours, South Korea and Japan, the Taiwanese economy is dominated by small and medium-sized businesses, rather than the large business groups. The global economic downturn, however, combined with poor policy co-ordination by the new administration and increasing bad debts in the banking system, pushed Taiwan into recession in 2001, the first whole year of negative growth since 1947. Due to the relocation of many manufacturing and labour-intensive industries to the PRC, unemployment also reached a level not seen since the 1970s oil crisis. This became a major issue in the 2004 presidential election. Growth averaged more than 4 per cent in the 2002–2006 period and the unemployment rate fell below 4 per cent.[269] The ROC often joins international organizations (especially ones that also include the People's Republic of China) under a politically neutral name. The ROC has been a member of governmental trade organizations such as the World Trade Organization under the name Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu (Chinese Taipei) since 2002.[270] Transport Main article: Transportation in Taiwan China Airlines aircraft line-up at Taoyuan International Airport The Ministry of Transportation and Communications of the Republic of China is the cabinet-level governing body of the transport network in Taiwan. Civilian transport in Taiwan is characterised by extensive use of scooters. In March 2019, 13.86 million were registered, twice that of cars.[271] Both highways and railways are concentrated near the coasts, where the majority of the population resides, with 1,619 km (1,006 mi) of motorway. Railways in Taiwan are primarily used for passenger services, with Taiwan Railway Administration (TRA) operating a circular route and Taiwan High Speed Rail (THSR) running high speed services on the west coast. Urban transit systems include Taipei Metro, Kaohsiung Rapid Transit, Taoyuan Metro and New Taipei Metro. Major airports include Taiwan Taoyuan, Kaohsiung, Taipei Songshan and Taichung. There are currently seven airlines in Taiwan, the largest ones being China Airlines and EVA Air. There are four international seaports: Keelung, Kaohsiung, Taichung, and Hualien. Education Main articles: Education in Taiwan, Academia Sinica, and History of education in Taiwan See also: Scholarships in Taiwan and Economy of Taiwan § Science Taiwan's higher education system was established by Japan during the colonial period. However, after the Republic of China took over in 1945, the system was promptly replaced by the same system as in mainland China which mixed features of the Chinese and American educational systems.[272] Taiwanese schoolgirls in 2011 Taiwan is well known for adhering to the Confucian paradigm of valuing education as a means to improve one's socioeconomic position in society.[273][274] Heavy investment and a cultural valuing of education has catapulted the resource-poor nation consistently to the top of global education rankings. Taiwan is one of the top-performing countries in reading literacy, mathematics and sciences. In 2015, Taiwanese students achieved one of the world's best results in mathematics, science and literacy, as tested by the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), with the average student scoring 519, compared with the OECD average of 493, placing it seventh in the world.[275][276][277] The Taiwanese education system has been praised for various reasons, including its comparatively high test results and its major role in promoting Taiwan's economic development while creating one of the world's most highly educated workforces.[278][279] Taiwan has also been praised for its high university entrance rate where the university acceptance rate has increased from around 20 per cent before the 1980s to 49 per cent in 1996 and over 95 per cent since 2008, among the highest in Asia.[280][281][282] The nation's high university entrance rate has created a highly skilled workforce making Taiwan one of the most highly educated countries in the world with 68.5 per cent of Taiwanese high school students going on to attend university.[283] Taiwan has a high percentage of its citizens holding a tertiary education degree where 45 per cent of Taiwanese aged 25–64 hold a bachelor's degree or higher compared with the average of 33 per cent among member countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).[282][284] On the other hand, the system has been criticised for placing excessive pressure on students while eschewing creativity and producing an excess supply of over-educated university graduates and a high graduate unemployment rate. With a large number of university graduates seeking a limited number of prestigious white collar jobs in an economic environment that is increasingly losing its competitive edge, this has led many graduates to be employed in lower-end jobs with salaries far beneath their expectations.[285][274] Taiwan's universities have also been under criticism for not being able to fully meet the requirements and demands of Taiwan's 21st-century fast-moving labour market, citing a skills mismatch among a large number of self-assessed, overeducated university graduates who don't fit the demands of the modern Taiwanese labour market.[286] The Taiwanese government has also received criticism for undermining the economy as it has been unable to produce enough jobs to meet the demands of numerous underemployed university graduates.[280][287] As the Taiwanese economy is largely science and technology based, the labour market demands people who have achieved some form of higher education, particularly related to science and engineering to gain a competitive edge when searching for employment. Although current Taiwanese law mandates only nine years of schooling, 95 per cent of junior high graduates go on to attend a senior vocational high school, university, junior college, trade school, or other higher education institution.[283][288] Since Made in China 2025 was announced in 2015, aggressive campaigns to recruit Taiwanese chip industry talent to support its mandates resulted in the loss of more than 3,000 chip engineers to mainland China,[289] and raised concerns of a ""brain drain"" in Taiwan.[290][289][291] Many Taiwanese students attend cram schools, or buxiban, to improve skills and knowledge on problem solving against exams of subjects like mathematics, nature science, history and many others. Courses are available for most popular subjects and include lectures, reviews, private tutorial sessions, and recitations.[292][293] As of 2018[update], the literacy rate in Taiwan is 98.87 per cent.[294] Demographics Main article: Demographics of Taiwan Population density map of Taiwan (residents per square kilometre) Taiwan has a population of about 23.4 million,[295] most of whom are on the island of Taiwan. The remainder live on the outlying islands of Penghu (101,758), Kinmen (127,723), and Matsu (12,506).[296] Largest cities and counties Main article: List of cities in Taiwan The figures below are the March 2019 estimates for the twenty most populous administrative divisions; a different ranking exists when considering the total metropolitan area populations (in such rankings the Taipei-Keelung metro area is by far the largest agglomeration). The figures reflect the number of household registrations in each city, which may differ from the number of actual residents. vte Largest cities and special municipalities in Taiwansource Rank Name Division Pop.

Alternatively, the ethnic groups of Taiwan may be roughly divided among the Hoklo (70 per cent), the Hakka (14 per cent), the Waishengren (14 per cent), and indigenous peoples (2 per cent).[12] The Hoklo people are the largest ethnic group (70 per cent of the total population), whose Han ancestors migrated from the coastal southern Fujian region across the Taiwan Strait starting in the 17th century. The Hakka comprise about 15 per cent of the total population, and descend from Han migrants to Guangdong, its surrounding areas and Taiwan. Additional people of Han origin include and descend from the 2 million Nationalists who fled to Taiwan following the communist victory on the mainland in 1949.[12] The indigenous Taiwanese aborigines number about 533,600 and are divided into 16 groups.[297] The Ami, Atayal, Bunun, Kanakanavu, Kavalan, Paiwan, Puyuma, Rukai, Saisiyat, Saaroa, Sakizaya, Sediq, Thao, Truku and Tsou live mostly in the eastern half of the island, while the Yami inhabit Orchid Island.[298][299] Languages Map of the most commonly used home language in Taiwan where blue 'cmn' = ""Mandarin"", green 'nan' = ""Hokkien""/""Min Nan"", hot-pink 'hak' = ""Hakka"", burgundy 'map' = austronesian languages. Main article: Languages of Taiwan Mandarin is the primary language used in business and education, and is spoken by the vast majority of the population. Traditional Chinese is used as the writing system.[300] The Republic of China does not have any legally designated official language , but Mandarin plays the role of the defacto official language.[3] Since the May Fourth Movement, written vernacular Chinese had replaced Classical Chinese and emerged as the mainstream written Chinese in the Republic of China. But Classical Chinese continued to be widely used in the Government of the Republic of China. Most government documents in the Republic of China were written in Classical Chinese until reforms in the 1970s, in a reform movement spearheaded by President Yen Chia-kan to shift the written style to a more integrated vernacular Chinese and Classical Chinese style (文白合一行文).[301][302] After January 1, 2005, the Executive Yuan also changed the long-standing official document writing habit from vertical writing style to horizontal writing style. Today, pure Classical Chinese is occasionally used in formal or ceremonial occasions, religious or cultural rites in Taiwan. The National Anthem of the Republic of China (中華民國國歌), for example, is in Classical Chinese. Taoist texts are still preserved in Classical Chinese from the time they were composed. Buddhist texts, or sutras, are still preserved in Classical Chinese from the time they were composed or translated from Sanskrit sources. In practice there is a socially accepted continuum between vernacular Chinese and Classical Chinese. Most official government documents, legal, courts rulings and judiciary documents use a combined vernacular Chinese and Classical Chinese style (文白合一行文).[303] For example, most official notices and formal letters are written with a number of stock Classical Chinese expressions (e.g. salutation, closing). Personal letters, on the other hand, are mostly written in vernacular, but with some Classical phrases, depending on the subject matter, the writer's level of education, etc. As many legal documents are still written in Classical Chinese, which is not easily understood by the general public, a group of Taiwanese had launched the Legal Vernacular Movement hoping to bring more Vernacular Chinese into the legal writings of the Republic of China.[304] 70 per cent of the population belong to the Hoklo ethnic group and speak Hokkien natively in addition to Mandarin. The Hakka group, comprising some 14–18 per cent of the population, speak Hakka. Although Mandarin is the language of instruction in schools and dominates television and radio, non-Mandarin Chinese varieties have undergone a revival in public life in Taiwan, particularly since restrictions on their use were lifted in the 1990s.[300] Formosan languages are spoken primarily by the indigenous peoples of Taiwan. They do not belong to the Chinese or Sino-Tibetan language family, but to the Austronesian language family, and are written in Latin alphabet.[305] Their use among aboriginal minority groups has been in decline as usage of Mandarin has risen.[300] Of the 14 extant languages, five are considered moribund.[306] Taiwan is officially multilingual. A national language in Taiwan is legally defined as ""a natural language used by an original people group of Taiwan and the Taiwan Sign Language"".[9] As of 2019, policies on national languages are in early stages of implementation, with Hakka and indigenous languages designated as such. Religion Main article: Religion in Taiwan Estimated religious composition in 2020[307] Chinese folk religion (including Confucianism) (43.8%)  Buddhists (21.2%)  Others (including Taoists) (15.5%)  Unaffiliated (13.7%)  Christians (5.8%)  Muslims (1%) The Constitution of the Republic of China protects people's freedom of religion and the practices of belief.[308] Freedom of religion in Taiwan is strong and ranks high at 9.2 in 2018 according to world bank.[309] In 2005, the census reported that the five largest religions were: Buddhism, Taoism, Yiguandao, Protestantism, and Roman Catholicism.[310] According to Pew Research, the religious composition of Taiwan in 2020[311] is estimated to be 43.8 per cent Folk religions, 21.2 per cent Buddhist, 15.5 Others (including Taoism), 13.7 per cent Unaffiliated, 5.8 per cent Christian and 1% Muslim. Taiwanese aborigines comprise a notable subgroup among professing Christians: ""...over 64 per cent identify as Christian... Church buildings are the most obvious markers of Aboriginal villages, distinguishing them from Taiwanese or Hakka villages"".[312] There has been a small Muslim community of Hui people in Taiwan since the 17th century.[313] Confucianism is a philosophy that deals with secular moral ethics, and serves as the foundation of both Chinese and Taiwanese culture. The majority of Taiwanese people usually combine the secular moral teachings of Confucianism with whatever religions they are affiliated with. As of 2019[update], there were 15,175 religious buildings in Taiwan, approximately one place of worship per 1,572 residents. 12,279 temples were dedicated to Taoism and Buddhism. There were 9,684 Taoist Temples and 2,317 Buddhist Temples.[314] In Taiwan’s 36,000 square kilometers of land, there are more than 33,000 places for religious (believers) to worship and gather. On average, there is one temple or church (church) or religious building for every square kilometer. The high density of place of worship is rare in the world, and it is the area with the highest density of religious buildings in the Chinese-speaking world. Taiwan is also the most religious region in the Chinese-speaking world. Even for Christianity, there are 2,845 Churches.[314] A significant percentage of the population of Taiwan is non-religious. Taiwan's strong human rights protections, lack of state-sanctioned discrimination, and generally high regard for freedom of religion or belief earned it a joint #1 ranking in the 2018 Freedom of Thought Report, alongside the Netherlands and Belgium.[315] Taiwan is clearly an outlier in the top 3, all-clear countries. It is non-European, and demographically much more religious. But in its relatively open, democratic and tolerant society we have recorded no evidence of laws or social discrimination against members of the non-religious minority.[316] LGBT Main articles: LGBT rights in Taiwan and Same-sex marriage in Taiwan On 24 May 2017, the Constitutional Court ruled that then-current marriage laws had been violating the Constitution by denying Taiwanese same-sex couples the right to marry. The Court ruled that if the Legislative Yuan did not pass adequate amendments to Taiwanese marriage laws within two years, same-sex marriages would automatically become lawful in Taiwan.[317] On 17 May 2019, Taiwan's parliament approved a bill legalising same-sex marriage, making it the first in Asia to do so.[318][319][320] Public health Main article: Healthcare in Taiwan National Taiwan University Hospital The current healthcare system in Taiwan, known as National Health Insurance (NHI, Chinese: 全民健康保險), was instituted in 1995. NHI is a single-payer compulsory social insurance plan that centralizes the disbursement of healthcare funds. The system promises equal access to healthcare for all citizens, and the population coverage had reached 99 per cent by the end of 2004.[321] NHI is mainly financed through premiums, which are based on the payroll tax, and is supplemented with out-of-pocket co-payments and direct government funding. Preventative health service, low-income families, veterans, children under three years old, and catastrophic diseases are exempt from co-payment. Low income households maintain 100 per cent premium coverage by the NHI and co-pays are reduced for disabled or certain elderly people.[citation needed] Early in the program, the payment system was predominantly fee-for-service. Most health providers operate in the private sector and form a competitive market on the health delivery side. However, many healthcare providers took advantage of the system by offering unnecessary services to a larger number of patients and then billing the government. In the face of increasing loss and the need for cost containment, NHI changed the payment system from fee-for-service to a global budget, a kind of prospective payment system, in 2002. The implementation of universal healthcare created fewer health disparities for lower-income citizens in Taiwan. According to a recently published survey, out of 3,360 patients surveyed at a randomly chosen hospital, 75.1 per cent of the patients said they are ""very satisfied"" with the hospital service; 20.5 per cent said they are ""okay"" with the service. Only 4.4 per cent of the patients said they are either ""not satisfied"" or ""very not satisfied"" with the service or care provided.[322] The Taiwanese disease control authority is the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and during the SARS outbreak in March 2003 there were 347 confirmed cases. During the outbreak the CDC and local governments set up monitoring stations throughout public transportation, recreational sites and other public areas. With full containment in July 2003, there has not been a case of SARS since.[323] Owing to the lessons from SARS, a National Health Command Center was established in 2004, which includes the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC). The CECC has since played a central role in Taiwan's approach to epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2019, the infant mortality rate was 4.2 deaths per 1,000 live births, with 20 physicians and 71 hospital beds per 10,000 people.[324][325] Life expectancy at birth in 2020 is 77.5 years and 83.9 years for males and females, respectively.[326] Culture Main articles: Culture of Taiwan, Cultural history of Taiwan, and Chinese Cultural Renaissance See also: Taiwanese Wave Apo Hsu and the NTNU Symphony Orchestra onstage in the National Concert Hall The cultures of Taiwan are a hybrid blend from various sources, incorporating elements of traditional Chinese culture, attributable to the historical and ancestral origin of the majority of its current residents, Japanese cultural influence, traditional Confucianist beliefs, and increasingly Western values. During the martial law period in which the Republic of China was officially anti-communist, the Kuomintang promoted an official traditional Chinese culture over Taiwan in order to emphasize that the Republic of China represents the true orthodoxy to Chinese Culture (and therefore the ""real and legitimate China"") as opposed to Communist China.[327] The government launched what's known as the Chinese Cultural Renaissance movement in Taiwan in opposition to the cultural destructions caused by the Chinese Communist Party during the Cultural Revolution. The General Assembly of Chinese Culture (中華文化總會) was established as a movement promotion council to help promote Chinese Culture in Taiwan and overseas. It was Kuomintang's first structured plan for cultural development on Taiwan. Chiang himself was the head of the General Assembly of Chinese Culture. Subsequent President of the Republic of China also became the head of this General Assembly. The Chinese Cultural Renaissance movement in Taiwan coupled with Chinese Cultural education in Taiwan had helped to elevate the cultural refinement, mannerism and politeness of many Taiwanese, in contrast to the cultural destruction (uncultured behaviour) of many mainland Chinese due to the Cultural Revolution.[328] This has also led to Chinese Culture (esp. its soft culture) being better preserved in Taiwan than in mainland China, esp. when it comes to traditional religious and cultural customs, not to mention the continued use of Traditional Chinese. The influence of Confucianism can be found in the behaviour of Taiwanese people, known for their friendliness and politeness.[329] The uplifting of martial law ushered a period of democratization whereby Freedom of Speech and Expression led to a flourishing Taiwanese literature and Mass media in Taiwan. Reflecting the continuing controversy surrounding the political status of Taiwan, politics continues to play a role in the conception and development of a Taiwanese cultural identity, especially in its relationship to Chinese culture.[330] In recent years, the concept of Taiwanese multiculturalism has been proposed as a relatively apolitical alternative view, which has allowed for the inclusion of mainlanders and other minority groups into the continuing re-definition of Taiwanese culture as collectively held systems of meaning and customary patterns of thought and behaviour shared by the people of Taiwan.[331] Identity politics, along with the over one hundred years of political separation from mainland China, has led to distinct traditions in many areas, including cuisine and music.

(June 2021) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Taiwanese writer, literary critic and politician Wang Tuoh Acclaimed classical musicians include violinist Cho-Liang Lin, pianist Ching-Yun Hu, and the Lincoln Center Chamber Music Society artist director Wu Han. Other musicians include Jay Chou and groups such as Mayday and heavy metal band Chthonic, led by singer Freddy Lim, which has been referred to as the ""Black Sabbath of Asia"".[332][333] Taiwanese television shows are popular in Singapore, Malaysia, and other Asian countries. Taiwanese films have won various international awards at film festivals around the world. Ang Lee, a Taiwanese director, has directed critically acclaimed films such as: Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon; Eat Drink Man Woman; Sense and Sensibility; Brokeback Mountain; Life of Pi; and Lust, Caution. Other famous Taiwanese directors include Tsai Ming-liang, Edward Yang, and Hou Hsiao-hsien. Taiwan has hosted the Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards since 1962. Taiwan hosts the National Palace Museum, which houses more than 650,000 pieces of Chinese bronze, jade, calligraphy, painting, and porcelain and is considered one of the greatest collections of Chinese art and objects in the world.[334] The KMT moved this collection from the Forbidden City in Beijing in 1933 and part of the collection was eventually transported to Taiwan during the Chinese Civil War. The collection, estimated to be one-tenth of China's cultural treasures, is so extensive that only 1 per cent is on display at any time. The PRC had said that the collection was stolen and has called for its return, but the ROC has long defended its control of the collection as a necessary act to protect the pieces from destruction, especially during the Cultural Revolution. Relations regarding this treasure have since warmed, with the National Palace Museum loaning artwork to various museums in the PRC in 2010.[335] Popular culture Karaoke, drawn from contemporary Japanese culture, is extremely popular in Taiwan, where it is known as KTV. KTV businesses operate in a hotel-like style, renting out small rooms and ballrooms according to the number of guests in a group. Many KTV establishments partner with restaurants and buffets to form all-encompassing and elaborate evening affairs for families, friends, or businessmen. Tour buses that travel around Taiwan have several TVs, primarily for singing Karaoke. The entertainment counterpart of a KTV is MTV Taiwan, particularly in urban areas. There, DVD movies can be played in a private theatre room. However, MTV, more so than KTV, has a growing reputation for being a place that young couples will go to be alone and intimate.[336][citation needed] Taiwan has a high density of 24-hour convenience stores, which, in addition to the usual services, provide services on behalf of financial institutions or government agencies, such as collection of parking fees, utility bills, traffic violation fines, and credit card payments.[337] They also provide a service for mailing packages. Chains such as FamilyMart provide clothing laundry services,[338] and it is possible to purchase or receive tickets for TRA and THSR tickets at convenience stores, specifically 7-Eleven, FamilyMart, Hi-Life and OK.[339][340] Taiwanese culture has also influenced other cultures. Bubble tea has now become a global phenomenon with its popularity spreading across the globe.[341] Sports Main article: Sports in Taiwan Yani Tseng with the 2011 Women's British Open trophy Tai Tzu-ying, the current world No.1 in BWF at the 2018 Chinese Taipei Open Baseball is Taiwan's national sport and is a popular spectator sport. The Taiwanese men's baseball team and women's baseball team are world No.2 in the WBSC Rankings as of June 2021. There have been sixteen Taiwanese Major League Baseball players in the United States as of the 2020 MLB Season, including former pitchers Chien-Ming Wang and Wei-Yin Chen. The Chinese Professional Baseball League in Taiwan was established in 1989,[342] and eventually absorbed the competing Taiwan Major League in 2003. As of 2019[update], the CPBL has four teams with average attendance over 5,826 per game.[343] Besides baseball, basketball is Taiwan's other major sport.[344] The P. League+ was established in September 2020 as Taiwan's professional basketball league, consisted of 4 teams.[345] A semi-professional Super Basketball League (SBL) has also been in play since 2003.[346] Two other teams from Taiwan compete in the ASEAN Basketball League, a professional men's basketball league in East and Southeast Asia. Taiwan participates in international sporting organizations and events under the name of ""Chinese Taipei"" due to its political status. In 2009, Taiwan hosted two international sporting events on the island. The World Games 2009 were held in Kaohsiung between 16 and 26 July 2009. Taipei hosted the 21st Summer Deaflympics in September of the same year. Furthermore, Taipei hosted the Summer Universiade in 2017.[347] In the near future, Taipei and New Taipei City will co-host the 2025 World Masters Games, as governed by the International Masters Games Association (IMGA).[348] Taekwondo has become a mature and successful sport in Taiwan in recent years. In the 2004 Olympics, Chen Shih-hsin and Chu Mu-yen won the first two gold medals in the women's flyweight event and the men's flyweight event, respectively. Subsequent taekwondo competitors such as Yang Shu-chun have strengthened Taiwan's taekwondo culture. Taiwan has a long history of strong international presence in table tennis. Chen Pao-pei was a gold medalist in the women's singles at the Asian Table Tennis Championships in 1953 and gold medalist with Chiang Tsai-yun in the 1957 women's doubles and women's team events. Lee Kuo-ting won the men's singles at the 1958 Asian Table Tennis Championships. More recently Chen Chien-an won the 2008 World Junior Table Tennis Championships in singles and pairing with Chuang Chih-yuan won the men's doubles in 2013 at the 52nd World Table Tennis Championships. Playing for Taiwan Chen Jing won a bronze medal at the 1996 Olympic Games and a silver medal at the 2000 Olympic Games. 17-year-old Lin Yun-Ju upset both reigning world champion Ma Long and world ranked No. 3 Fan Zhendong to win the 2019 men's singles in the T2 Diamond Series in Malaysia.[349][350][351][352] In Tennis, Hsieh Su-wei is the country's most successful player, having been ranked inside the top 25 in singles in the WTA rankings.[353] She became joint No. 1 in doubles with her partner Peng Shuai in 2014.[354] The sisters Chan Yung-jan (Latisha Chan) and Chan Hao-ching are doubles specialists. They won their 13th WTA tournament together at the 2019 Eastbourne International,[355] the second-highest number of wins for a pair of sisters after the Williams sisters.[356] Latisha Chan became joint No. 1 with partner Martina Hingis in 2017.[357] The most successful men's player was Lu Yen-hsun, who reached No. 33 in the ATP rankings in 2010.[358] Taiwan is also a major competitor in korfball, placing third place four times at the World Championship (in 1991, 2011, 2015, and 2019), and hosting and taking second place at the U23 World Championship in 2008[359] (as well as taking third in 2012 and second in 2016). Taiwan also took silver at the 2017 World Games and bronze in 2013, 2001, 1997, and at the 2009 games held in Kaohsiung.[360] Taiwan is also set to host the 2023 IKF World Korfball Championship. Yani Tseng is the most famous Taiwanese professional golfer currently playing on the US-based LPGA Tour. She is the youngest player ever, male or female, to win five major championships and was ranked number 1 in the Women's World Golf Rankings for 109 consecutive weeks from 2011 to 2013.[361][362][363] Taiwan's strength in badminton is demonstrated by the current world No. 1 ranking female player, Tai Tzu-ying, and the world No.2 ranking male player Chou Tien-chen in the BWF World Tour.[364][365] Calendar Main article: Minguo calendar See also: Chinese calendar and Public holidays in Taiwan The standard Gregorian calendar is used for most purposes in Taiwan. The year is often denoted by the Minguo era system which starts in 1912, the year the ROC was founded. 2021 is year 110 Minguo (民國110年). The East Asian date format is used in Chinese.[366] Prior to standardisation in 1929, the official calendar was a lunisolar system, which remains in use today for traditional festivals such as the Lunar New Year, the Lantern Festival, and the Dragon Boat Festival.[367] See also Taiwan portal Islands portal Index of Taiwan-related articles Outline of Taiwan Notes ^ Taipei is the official seat of government of the Republic of China although the Constitution of the Republic of China does not specify the de jure capital.[1] ^ Mandarin (de facto)[3]Vernacular Chinese (used in most occasions) Classical Chinese (used in formal or ceremonial occasions, religious or cultural rites, official documents, legal and court rulings and judiciary documents)[4] ^ a b c Not designated but meets legal definition ^ A national language in Taiwan is legally defined as ""a natural language used by an original people group of Taiwan and the Taiwan Sign Language"".[9] ^ Mixed indigenous-Han ancestry is included in the figure for Han Chinese. ^ Interpretations on whether this entails a complete transfer of the territory’s sovereignty to the Republic of China vary.

As early as 1636, a Dutch missionary referred to this group as Taiouwang. From the name of the tribe, the Portuguese called the area around Ping'an as Tayowan, Taiyowan, Tyovon, Teijoan, Toyouan, and so forth. Indeed, already in his ship's log of 1622, the Dutchman Cornelis Reijersen referred to the area as Teijoan and Taiyowan. ^ 蔡玉仙; et al., eds. (2007). 府城文史 (in Chinese). Tainan City Government.

AMAGARD UFRIN The Garamantes were a Saharan Berber-speaking people who used an elaborate underground irrigation system, and founded a kingdom in the Fezzan area of modern-day Libya, in the Sahara desert. They were a local power in the Sahara between 500 BC - 500 AD. There is not much information about the Garamantes, not even the name they used to call themselves; Garamantes was a Greek name which the Romans later adopted.

Wikipedia Portrait Contact Us English French Bref historique de TaxCOOP In 2005-2006, Brigitte Alepin (co-founder of TaxCOOP) conducted a research contract with the Harvard Kennedy School on the question: “How to adapt our tax systems to globalization? “. Tax competition that will result from the implementation of our plans traditional tax in a globalized world.es fiscaux à la mondialisation ?». L’idée de TaxCOOP lui est venue alors qu’elle réalisait la concurrence fiscale qui résultera de l’application de nos régimes traditionnels d’imposition dans un monde mondialisé. TaxCOOP on the GLOBAL TAX 50 of the world's most influential figures and organizations At the beginning of 2013, realising that the crucial issue of international tax competition between nations and between businesses hadn’t been studied globally, Brigitte Alepin met up with Daniel McMahon, President executive officer of l’Ordre des CPA in Quebec to ask him to join her initiative to implement the first global conference about tax competition. He agreed to. In 2013 and 2014, Brigitte Alepin travelled the world to talk to international organisations and tax policy leaders about TaxCoop and seize their appeal. Once tax policy leaders from the OECD and the UN had confirmed their official participation, TaxCOOP was launched. TaxCoop 2015 was introduced in Montréal at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts and was a great success. Never has a conference about taxation been so popular in Canada. Tax COOP 2016 was presented at the World Bank on May 23rd and on the 24th in Washignton. This conference was also a great success. TaxCOOP 2017 was presented to the United Nations in Geneva on October 16, 2017. This is the first major tax conference presented to the United Nations. On 15 December 2017, TaxCOOP was ranked on the prestigious Global tax 50 of the most influential personalities and organizations in the world in taxation. This is the only conference on this prestigious list. TaxCOOP 2018 is presented on 2-3 October 2018 at OECD headquarters on the occasion of the Paris Conference. Learn more ?

213,"Tearfund - Wikipedia Tearfund From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Christian charity ‹ The template Infobox organization is being considered for merging. › TearfundFounded1971FounderGeorge Hoffman and the Evangelical AllianceTypeChristian charityRegistration no.265464 (England & Wales) SC037624 (Scotland)Websitewww.tearfund.org Tearfund is an international Christian relief and development agency based in Teddington, UK. It currently works in around 50 countries, with a primary focus on supporting those in poverty and providing disaster relief for disadvantaged communities.[1] Tearfund states that it offers this support regardless of race or religious affiliation. However, they fulfil the work by operating largely through local Christian churches and other Christian partner organisations around the world.[1] Contents 1 History 2 Sister organisations 3 Projects working within Tearfund in the UK 4 Publications 5 Advocacy and campaigning 6 High profile supporters and ambassadors 7 References 8 External links History[edit] The charity organisation was created by the Evangelical Alliance (EA), which was receiving spontaneous aid from its supporters.[2] The money was distributed to support existing aid agencies, before the EA launched an entirely new organisation. Originally named The Evangelical Alliance Relief Fund Committee,[3]:17this was later abbreviated to the acronym TEAR Fund, before finally changing to Tearfund. The charity was initially headed by former curate, George Hoffman, who was also one of its founders.[3]:21 TEAR fund was launched in 1968 and officially registered as a charity in 1973.[3]:21 In 1972, Tearfund worked overseas for the first time – as opposed to funding projects run by existing agencies – working in hospitals, clinics, and feeding camps of Bangladesh alongside the charity Interserve.[3]:62 John Stott was the first International President of Tearfund and was succeeded in 1997 by joint Presidents Rene Padilla and Elaine Storkey. Launch of disaster response work In 1994, Tearfund set up the Disaster Response Unit, later re-named the Disaster Management Team.[3]:65–66 The first disaster responded to was the aftermath of the Rwandan genocide. Under Executive Director, Doug Balfour, Tearfund became a member of the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC), an umbrella group, comprising 13 charities, including Oxfam and Christian Aid. It has continued to work in cooperation with these charities in emergency disaster work. It also became part of the joint initiative to combat HIV/AIDS, headed up initially by President Dr Elaine Storkey. Tearcraft and the fairtrade movement Tearfund began Tearcraft, an early fairtrade venture, in 1974. They imported goods such as coffee, crafts and jewellery from areas where it was working. Most of the items were sold through a network of volunteer church representatives in the UK. Tearcraft’s work was wound up in 2015, with more and more fairly traded goods available elsewhere. However, the charity Traidcraft, formed in 1979 by Tearcraft founder Richard Adams (businessman), continues very similar work – Adams had left Tearfund, unhappy that Tearcraft only worked with evangelical Christian organisations overseas. Adams also went on to found the Fairtrade Foundation in 1989 which has played a central role in bringing fairly traded goods to a wider public.[3]:133 Child sponsorship programme Tearfund began an early child sponsorship programme, ‘Family Plan’ in 1974 – later renaming it ‘Partners in Childcare’. The first children sponsored were Bangladeshi orphans. Tearfund later changed its emphasis from institutional care to supporting children through families and local churches. Tearfund’s child sponsorship work was wound up in 1999. Micah Network In 1999, Tearfund played a role in the foundation of the Micah Network, which consists of over 750 evangelical organisations worldwide. The network aims to strengthen the work of the member charities, share best practice, and examine the Christian distinctives of their work,.[4] 50th Anniversary Tearfund marked its 50th Anniversary in 2018 with an extensive campaign encouraging financial giving, prayer for an end to extreme poverty and further support for its campaigning work. There have also been a number of events around the UK marking the anniversary, including a service in Coventry Cathedral featuring the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby.[5] Sister organisations[edit] A number of other international charities have been launched in partnership with Tearfund. These are separate organisations that all have ties with Tearfund itself: Tearfund Ireland, founded 2008.[6] Tearfund (New Zealand), founded 1975.[7] Tear based in the Netherlands, founded 1973.[8] Tearfund Canada (formerly World Relief Canada), founded 1970.[9] Sel based in France, founded 1980.[10] Tear Australia, founded 1971.[11] Tearfund Belgium, founded 1979.[12] TearFund (Switzerland), founded 1984.[13] In 2018 Tearfund announced that it was launching Tearfund USA, with Sonia Patterson, founder of the Impact Wisdom website,[14] the first CEO.[15] Projects working within Tearfund in the UK[edit] A number of discrete initiatives currently operate within Tearfund in the UK. These include: Restored: An international Christian Alliance working to end violence against women, with a focus on transforming relationships.[16] Toilet Twinning: Funds the building of latrines and sanitation projects around the world by getting people to twin their toilets in the UK with an overseas latrine.[17] Inspired Individuals: The Tearfund-sponsored programme identifies, nurtures and links up Christian entrepreneurs who are radical changemakers in their communities.[18] Tearfund Learn: An arm of Tearfund that produces a wide range of educational resources for people involved in development work.[19] There are also separate Tearfund offices in Wales,[20] Scotland[21] and Northern Ireland,[22] each initiating nation-specific campaigning and communications as well as coordinating on UK-wide work. Publications[edit] Tearfund produces a number of regular and one-off publications, mostly available in both printed and digital formats. Current publications include: Tear Times – A magazine sent to supporters three times a year, with news, stories and promotions.[23] Prayer Diary – Sent with Tear Times, containing prayer points for every day.[24] Tearfund Learn – publish a number of educational resources, include Footsteps, a community development magazine. It is currently translated into five languages and distributed worldwide three times a year. They also regularly produce training materials on topics such as environmental sustainability.[25] Church publications – Tearfund sends supporting churches regular resources to coincide with appeals and emergencies. It occasionally produces church and Bible study group resources for Christmas and Easter.[26] It also publishes a number of reports on development-related issues such as sustainability.[27][28] Advocacy and campaigning[edit] Advocacy (influencing government policy and practice) and campaigning are a major part of Tearfund’s current work. Tearfund first spoke out about climate change as part of the Whose Earth? campaign in 1992, with evangelical organisations Spring Harvest and Youth for Christ. In 1997, Tearfund started a full-scale programme to equip supporters to campaign on poverty issues called ‘Global Action Network’.[3]:183 Isabel Carter from Tearfund was part of the team that launched the international Jubilee 2000 campaign in 1996.[29] The campaign, which later became the Jubilee Debt Coalition, was based around the biblical idea of Jubilee (Christianity). It called for the debt of the world’s poorest nations to be cancelled, to mark the forthcoming new millennium. In 2005, Tearfund joined a number of NGOs and other groups for the Make Poverty History campaign. This also focused on global debt as well as fairer trade between rich and developing nations and more, ‘better targeted’, aid. Make Poverty History was dissolved in 2006, although the Jubilee Debt Campaign continues to campaign on a number of related issues.[30] In 2012 Tearfund campaigned with the Publish What You Pay coalition, leading to oil, gas, mining and forestry companies registered within the EU being required to publish payments made to governments anywhere in the world.[31][32] Tearfund currently campaigns on climate change – stressing its role in the creation of global poverty – pressing for greater global access to clean energy. They are members of The Climate Coalition (UK), with 130 other charities including Christian Aid and Friends of the Earth. They have extensively promoted the circular economy – an economic model based on the re-use of resources and avoidance of unnecessary waste.[33] In 2019 Tearfund launched a 'Rubbish Campaign' which petitioned large companies such as Coca-Cola, Nestlé, PepsiCo and Unilever to manage their plastic pollution.[34] High profile supporters and ambassadors[edit] Current Tearfund ambassadors include Tamsin Greig and Bear Grylls, along with a number of evangelical Christian leaders including Rev Katei Kirby and Pete Greig.[35] Other supporters have included Sir John Houghton,[36] Dr Krish Kandiah, Bishop Harold Miller and Martha Collison. Sir Cliff Richard has been a long-term supporter, brought into the organisation by John Stott. He dedicated the proceeds one of the charity evenings for his 50th anniversary to the organisation.

This November, world leaders will gather in Glasgow for the UN climate talks, COP26. This is a critical moment: it’s an opportunity to make big decisions that will affect all of us around the world. And the church has a crucial role to play in speaking up and praying for our global neighbours living in poverty, who are most vulnerable to the impacts of the climate crisis. On the middle Sunday during the COP26 summit, Tearfund will host our COP26 church service, along with churches throughout the UK. Your church can get involved by sharing our pre-recorded video, or by joining our livestream. The video content will be available in different segments, so your church can choose how to integrate it into your service. This resource will be available for download in the autumn, but there are two things you can do now: Register your interest using the button below, and be the first to hear when the COP26 church service is available for download.

Tebtebba applies an “Integrated holistic approach for indigenous peoples’ sustainable, self-determined development” (IPSSDD). It integrates the human rights-based approach, ecosystem-based approach, a knowledge-based approach which puts primacy to indigenous peoples’ traditional knowledge but that is open to appropriate and relevant modern scientific knowledge, gender, sustainable economy, inter-generational and inter-culturality. Tebtebba has its base in the Philippines, and has a strong outreach through an extensive network over the world. Our collaboration: Tebtebba has been part of developing the concept of “Community Based Monitroing and Information Systems” (CBMIS) which is based on communities own tools for monitoring their territroies and resources, to the benefit of their governance and decision making. The monitoring can also provide input for monitoring on scales beyond the local. The ongoing project embraces and develop further the activities based on CBMIS and will continue to provide substantial contributions to methods development for bottom up monitoring of the Aichi targets of the CBD, as well as to the IPBES and SDGs. The overall objective is “to enable indigenous communities to assert their rights to lands and territories and manage resources towards attaining food security while strengthening community resilience”. Whereas piloting is done by partners in the Philippines, outreach and upscaling will contribute to the Indigenous Peoples’ Global Partnership on Climate Change, Forests and Sustainable Development, organized by Tebtebba and composed of 18 Indigenous organizations in 13 countries in Tropical and Sub-tropical regions.

Secretary, KJBS, Surendra Ma...sti, Sarpanch, Mahadeiput and Sri Prabhakar Adhikari, Secretary, Pragati encouraged the youth to conserve indigenous seeds. The prime objective of the Seed Mela was to make the youth farmers aware on significance of indigenous seeds and their conservation in the context of adaptation to climate change and climate smart agriculture. 40 youth farmers of Mahadeiput and Kendar Panchayat participated in the programme where about 80 varieties of different indigenous seeds were displayed by the youth farmers. On this occasion, a seed bank was also inaugurated at Daleiput Community Centre. Many of the indigenous seeds have climate resilient properties and their conservation in seed banks and by traditional methods can rejuvenate sustainable agriculture and nutritional food security. #sustainableagriculture #NutritionalFoodSecurity #smallfarmers #indigenousseds #tribal #seedbank #ClimateSmartAgriculture #ClimateChangeChallenges #seedmela See MoreTebtebbaAugust 29 at 10:22 PM · #IUCN #WeAreIndigenous #IndigenousPeoplesCommunity Land Action Now - CLANAugust 29 at 2:11 PMGetting Indigenous groups a seat at the IUCN table has been a decades-long battle, explains Kankana-ey Igorot peoples activist Victoria Tauli-CorpuzIndigenous organizations from every continent will join this year's IUCN’s General Assembly.grist.orgIndigenous peoples are finally getting a say in global conservation policyIndigenous organizations from every continent will join this year's IUCN’s General Assembly.Indigenous organizations from every continent will join this year's IUCN’s General Assembly.See AllSee More",Tebtebba Foundation

It was founded in 1829 at the initiative of Hans Christian Ørsted as Denmark's first polytechnic, and it is today ranked among Europe's leading engineering institutions. Along with École Polytechnique in Paris, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Eindhoven University of Technology, Technical University of Munich and Technion – Israel Institute of Technology, DTU is a member of EuroTech Universities Alliance.[3] Contents 1 History 2 Organization and administration 2.1 Departments 2.2 Research centers 3 Campus 4 Controversy 5 Rankings 6 Extracurricular organizations 6.1 Sports 6.2 Student organizations 7 Notable alumni and faculty 8 See also 9 Notes and references 10 External links History[edit] DTU was founded in 1829 as the ""College of Advanced Technology"" (Danish: Den Polytekniske Læreanstalt). The Physicist Hans Christian Ørsted, at that time a professor at the University of Copenhagen, was one of the driving forces behind this initiative. He was inspired by the École Polytechnique in Paris, France which Ørsted had visited as a young scientist. The new institution was inaugurated on 5 November 1829 with Ørsted becoming its Principal, a position he held until his death in 1851.[4] The College of Advanced Technology's premises in Sølvgade, completed 1889 The first home of the new college consisted of two buildings located in Studiestræde and St- Pederstræde in the center of Copenhagen. Although these buildings were expanded several times, they eventually became inadequate for the requirements of the college. In 1890 a new building complex was completed and inaugurated located in Sølvgade. The new buildings were designed by the architect Johan Daniel Herholdt.[4] In 1903, the College of Advanced Technology commenced the education of electrical engineers in addition to that of the construction engineers, the production engineers, and the mechanical engineers who already at that time were being educated at the college. In the 1920s, space again became insufficient and in 1929 the foundation stone was laid for a new school at Østervold. Completion of this building was delayed by World War II and it was not completed before 1954.[4] From 1933, the institution was officially known as Danmarks tekniske Højskole (DtH), which commonly was translated into English, as the 'Technical University of Denmark'. On 1 April 1994, in connection with the joining of Danmarks Ingeniørakademi (DIA) and DTH, the Danish name was changed to Danmarks Tekniske Universitet, this done to include the word 'University' thus giving rise to the initials DTU by which the university is commonly known today. The formal name, Den Polytekniske Læreanstalt, Danmarks Tekniske Universitet, however, still includes the original name. Main building in Lyngby. R/V Dana is DTU's research vessel, visiting Ystad 18 November 2016. In 1960 a decision was made to move the College of Advanced Technology to new and larger facilities in Lyngby north of Copenhagen. They were inaugurated on 17 May 1974.[4] On 23 and 24 November 1967, the University Computing Center hosted the NATO Science Committee's Study Group first meeting discussing the newly coined term ""Software Engineering"".[5] On 1 January 2007, the university was merged with the following Danish research centers: Forskningscenter Risø, Danmarks Fødevareforskning, Danmarks Fiskeriundersøgelser (from 1 January 2008: National Institute for Aquatic Resources; DTU Aqua), Danmarks Rumcenter, and Danmarks Transport-Forskning. Organization and administration[edit] The university is governed by a board consisting of 10 members: Six members are recruited from outside the university and they form the majority of the board. One member is appointed by the scientific staff and one member is appointed by the administrative staff. Two members are appointed by the university students. The President of DTU is appointed by the university board. The President in turn appoints the Deans, and the Deans appoint the Heads of the departments. In 2014, DTU was granted institutional accreditation by the Danish Accreditation Institution (a member of ENQA). The institutional accreditation ensures that the quality assurance system of the institution is well-described, well-argued, and well-functioning in practice. Since DTU has no faculty senate, and since the faculty is not involved in the appointment of the President, Deans, or Department heads, the university has no faculty governance.[6] Departments[edit] DTU Aqua, National Institute for Aquatic Resources DTU Business, DTU Executive School of Business DTU Cen, Center for Electron Nanoscopy DTU Centre for Technology Entrepreneurship DTU Chemical Engineering, Department of Chemical and Biochemical Engineering DTU Chemistry, Department of Chemistry DTU Civil Engineering, Department of Civil Engineering DTU Compute, Institut for Matematik og Computer Science DTU Danchip, National Center for Micro and Nanofabrication DTU Diplom, Department of Bachelor Engineering DTU Electrical Engineering, Department of Electrical Engineering DTU Environment, Department of Environmental Engineering DTU Executive School of Business DTU Food, National Food Institute DTU Fotonik, Department of Photonics Engineering DTU Management Engineering, Department of Management Engineering DTU Mechanical Engineering, Department of Mechanical Engineering DTU Nanotech, Department of Micro-and Nanotechnology DTU Physics, Department of Physics Risø DTU, National Laboratory for Sustainable Energy DTU Space, National Space Institute DTU Systems Biologi, Department of Systems Biology DTU Library, Technical Information Center of Denmark DTU Vet, National Veterinary Institute DTU Wind Energi, Department of Wind Energy DTU Transport, Department of Transport: The department provides Transportation and Logistics master's degree programs in engineering and technology.

The area was previously home to the airfield Lundtofte Flyveplads. The campus is roughly divided in half by the road Anker Engelunds Vej going in the east-west direction, and, perpendicular to that, by two lengthy, collinear roads located on either side of a parking lot. The campus is thus divided into four parts, referred to as quadrants, numbered 1 through 4 in correspondence with the conventional numbering of quadrants in the Cartesian coordinate system with north upwards. Controversy[edit] DTU was the subject of controversy in 2009 because the (then) institute director of the Department of Chemistry, O.W. Sørensen,[8] was a high-ranking member of Scientology.[9] In relation to this, the university was accused of violating the principles of free speech by threatening to fire employees, among them Rolf W. Berg, who voiced their criticism of the institute director.[10][11][12][13][14][15] On 7 April 2010, the successor of Sørensen was announced, at a department meeting, as Erling Stenby,[16] who officially took over as Director on 1 May 2010.

It was founded in 1829 at the initiative of Hans Christian Ørsted as Denmark's first polytechnic, and it is today ranked among Europe's leading engineering institutions. Along with École Polytechnique in Paris, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Eindhoven University of Technology, Technical University of Munich and Technion – Israel Institute of Technology, DTU is a member of EuroTech Universities Alliance.[3] Contents 1 History 2 Organization and administration 2.1 Departments 2.2 Research centers 3 Campus 4 Controversy 5 Rankings 6 Extracurricular organizations 6.1 Sports 6.2 Student organizations 7 Notable alumni and faculty 8 See also 9 Notes and references 10 External links History[edit] DTU was founded in 1829 as the ""College of Advanced Technology"" (Danish: Den Polytekniske Læreanstalt). The Physicist Hans Christian Ørsted, at that time a professor at the University of Copenhagen, was one of the driving forces behind this initiative. He was inspired by the École Polytechnique in Paris, France which Ørsted had visited as a young scientist. The new institution was inaugurated on 5 November 1829 with Ørsted becoming its Principal, a position he held until his death in 1851.[4] The College of Advanced Technology's premises in Sølvgade, completed 1889 The first home of the new college consisted of two buildings located in Studiestræde and St- Pederstræde in the center of Copenhagen. Although these buildings were expanded several times, they eventually became inadequate for the requirements of the college. In 1890 a new building complex was completed and inaugurated located in Sølvgade. The new buildings were designed by the architect Johan Daniel Herholdt.[4] In 1903, the College of Advanced Technology commenced the education of electrical engineers in addition to that of the construction engineers, the production engineers, and the mechanical engineers who already at that time were being educated at the college. In the 1920s, space again became insufficient and in 1929 the foundation stone was laid for a new school at Østervold. Completion of this building was delayed by World War II and it was not completed before 1954.[4] From 1933, the institution was officially known as Danmarks tekniske Højskole (DtH), which commonly was translated into English, as the 'Technical University of Denmark'. On 1 April 1994, in connection with the joining of Danmarks Ingeniørakademi (DIA) and DTH, the Danish name was changed to Danmarks Tekniske Universitet, this done to include the word 'University' thus giving rise to the initials DTU by which the university is commonly known today. The formal name, Den Polytekniske Læreanstalt, Danmarks Tekniske Universitet, however, still includes the original name. Main building in Lyngby. R/V Dana is DTU's research vessel, visiting Ystad 18 November 2016. In 1960 a decision was made to move the College of Advanced Technology to new and larger facilities in Lyngby north of Copenhagen. They were inaugurated on 17 May 1974.[4] On 23 and 24 November 1967, the University Computing Center hosted the NATO Science Committee's Study Group first meeting discussing the newly coined term ""Software Engineering"".[5] On 1 January 2007, the university was merged with the following Danish research centers: Forskningscenter Risø, Danmarks Fødevareforskning, Danmarks Fiskeriundersøgelser (from 1 January 2008: National Institute for Aquatic Resources; DTU Aqua), Danmarks Rumcenter, and Danmarks Transport-Forskning. Organization and administration[edit] The university is governed by a board consisting of 10 members: Six members are recruited from outside the university and they form the majority of the board. One member is appointed by the scientific staff and one member is appointed by the administrative staff. Two members are appointed by the university students. The President of DTU is appointed by the university board. The President in turn appoints the Deans, and the Deans appoint the Heads of the departments. In 2014, DTU was granted institutional accreditation by the Danish Accreditation Institution (a member of ENQA). The institutional accreditation ensures that the quality assurance system of the institution is well-described, well-argued, and well-functioning in practice. Since DTU has no faculty senate, and since the faculty is not involved in the appointment of the President, Deans, or Department heads, the university has no faculty governance.[6] Departments[edit] DTU Aqua, National Institute for Aquatic Resources DTU Business, DTU Executive School of Business DTU Cen, Center for Electron Nanoscopy DTU Centre for Technology Entrepreneurship DTU Chemical Engineering, Department of Chemical and Biochemical Engineering DTU Chemistry, Department of Chemistry DTU Civil Engineering, Department of Civil Engineering DTU Compute, Institut for Matematik og Computer Science DTU Danchip, National Center for Micro and Nanofabrication DTU Diplom, Department of Bachelor Engineering DTU Electrical Engineering, Department of Electrical Engineering DTU Environment, Department of Environmental Engineering DTU Executive School of Business DTU Food, National Food Institute DTU Fotonik, Department of Photonics Engineering DTU Management Engineering, Department of Management Engineering DTU Mechanical Engineering, Department of Mechanical Engineering DTU Nanotech, Department of Micro-and Nanotechnology DTU Physics, Department of Physics Risø DTU, National Laboratory for Sustainable Energy DTU Space, National Space Institute DTU Systems Biologi, Department of Systems Biology DTU Library, Technical Information Center of Denmark DTU Vet, National Veterinary Institute DTU Wind Energi, Department of Wind Energy DTU Transport, Department of Transport: The department provides Transportation and Logistics master's degree programs in engineering and technology.

The area was previously home to the airfield Lundtofte Flyveplads. The campus is roughly divided in half by the road Anker Engelunds Vej going in the east-west direction, and, perpendicular to that, by two lengthy, collinear roads located on either side of a parking lot. The campus is thus divided into four parts, referred to as quadrants, numbered 1 through 4 in correspondence with the conventional numbering of quadrants in the Cartesian coordinate system with north upwards. Controversy[edit] DTU was the subject of controversy in 2009 because the (then) institute director of the Department of Chemistry, O.W. Sørensen,[8] was a high-ranking member of Scientology.[9] In relation to this, the university was accused of violating the principles of free speech by threatening to fire employees, among them Rolf W. Berg, who voiced their criticism of the institute director.[10][11][12][13][14][15] On 7 April 2010, the successor of Sørensen was announced, at a department meeting, as Erling Stenby,[16] who officially took over as Director on 1 May 2010.

It later became a part of Copenhagen Fief, which was changed to Copenhagen County in 1661. Although Copenhagen County changed many times over the years, Lyngby-Taarbæk always remained within the borders. When the counties were disestablished in 2007, Lyngby-Taarbæk came under the new Capital Region of Denmark. Since 1842, and until the 1970 Danish Municipal Reform, Lyngby-Taarbæk was a parish municipality. It became a regular municipality with the 1970 reform, and its borders have remained unchanged since. Lyngby-Taarbæk wasn't merged with any other municipality in the 2007 municipal reform.[2] Neighbourhoods[edit] Nearly the entirety of Lyngby-Taarbæk Municipality is part of the Greater Copenhagen area and so there are no towns or villages in the municipality. Instead there are named neighborhoods. On the list below are all the neighbourhoods with counted populations (numbers as of 2018).[3] Lyngby Storcenter. Virum 14,454 Kongens Lyngby 12,214 Ulrikkenborg 9,419 Sorgenfri 6,479 Lundtofte 6,210 Hjortekær 5,199 Taarbæk 1,498 Kongens Lyngby[edit] Main article: Kongens Lyngby House in Bondebyen.

Taarbæk is a small town or neighbourhood located in the eastern part of the municipality. It borders the Øresund to the east and Jægersborg Dyrehave to the west. Klampenborg is located to the south. Although Taarbæk is technically connected to the Greater Copenhagen Area, and thus a neighbourhood of Copenhagen, it is in the outskirts of the Greater Copenhagen Area and is occasionally referred to as its own town. Taarbæk is a former fishing village, with many old fishing houses preserved. The neighbourhood is, however, dominated by high-end luxury villas. Taarbæk Church and Taarbæk Harbour are both located centrally in the neighbourhood.[6] Virum[edit] Main article: Virum Virum is a neighbourhood located in the north-western part of the municipality.

The amusement park Dyrehavsbakken is located in the southern part of the park. The park spans 11 km2 and is home to around 2000 red and fallow deer. There are 19 gates to the park, all of them painted a characteristic red. The current design of the gates date back to the 1700s. The park is home to many old oaks, the oldest being around 850 years old and known as Skovfogedegen (literally ""forest ranger oak""), named such because it is located next to the forest ranger house Klampehus. The oak is hollow, and has throughout history been used for many things, including church ceremonies and as a shed for peat. Another oak is named Christian V's Oak, named such because Christian V suffered his fatal hunting injury nearby, when he was kicked by a wounded deer. Another old oak is named Ulvedalsegen and is around 600—700 years old. The park is also home to hawthorn, most of it naturally occurring. In the park is a mass grave from the Black Death victims from the 1600s and 1700s. These graves have been planted with hawthorn.[11] Jægersborg Dyrehave is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, listed among the par force hunting landscape in North Zealand. The park was originally established as hunting grounds, for hunts with hounds. The paths of the park reflects this, with a star-shaped path system, that would allow the hunters a better view of the hunting dogs.[12] The Hermitage Hunting Lodge is located centrally in the park.

The gatekeeper worked on the royal Sorgenfri Castle, and when Princess Charlotte was born in 1789 and the house was renamed to Lottenborg in her honour. Lottenberg eventually became a popular inn, and worked as inn and restaurant for many years. After the death of the owner in 1993, the house was willed to Lyngby-Taarbæk Municipality.

Carpenter Johan Jeremias Reusse built a construction in 1736, allowing the dining room table to be lowered down into the kitchen below. The construction was removed at the end of the 1700s. The hunting lodge underwent restorations in 1979–1991, and has hosted numerous royal banquets. It is available to the current royal family, and the queen hosts dinners at the hunting lodge.[37][13] Sorgenfri Palace is a castle located north of Kongens Lyngby, south of Brede and east of Sorgenfri. The first castle on the location was built in 1705–1706 by François Dieussart for Carl Greve Ahlefeldt. From 1730 it has been owned by the crown and royal family. The castle was rebuilt in 1756–1757 and was expanded again in 1791–1794. Frederik VII gave the castle to the Danish state, but it was given back to the royal family again in 1898. Much of the castle's gardens are open to the public.[38][39] Churches[edit] See List of churches in Lyngby-Taarbæk Municipality Parishes[edit] Parishes of Lyngby-Taarbæk Municipality.

Left is the coat of arms of Lyngby. Right is the coat of arms of Taarbæk. The coat of arms of Lyngby-Taarbæk Municipality is two distinct coats of arms, always portrayed together. On the left is the coat of arms of Lyngby and on the right is the coat of arms of Taarbæk. The coat of arms was first used in 1916. The coat of arms of Lyngby is red with a grey wavy line going across the shield. This line represents the stream Mølleåen, and the three water mill wheels represent the place's history with water mills. Above the grey line is a bronze-coloured crown, referring to former crown lands in the area. Also on the coat of arms are three branches of heather (Danish: Lyng), from which the place has its name. The coat of arms of Taarbæk is blue with two silver oars crossing the center along with a boat hook and an eel trap, also portrayed in silver. The fishing equipment refers to the place's history with fishing in Øresund.[46] Notable residents[edit] Nobility[edit] Frederick IX of Denmark (1899 on Sorgenfri Palace — 1972), king of Denmark from 1947 to 1972 Knud, Hereditary Prince of Denmark (1900 on Sorgenfri Palace — 1976), hereditary prince and former heir presumptive Ingolf of Rosenborg (born 1940 on Sorgenfri Palace), count Public thought and politics[edit] Ingrid Jespersen Vilhelm Theodor Walther (1819 in Kongens Lyngby — 1892), architect and building inspector Ingrid Jespersen (1867 in Kongens Lyngby — 1938), pedagogue and school principal Finn Thiesen (born 1941 in Kongens Lyngby), linguist and translator Carsten Koch (born 1945 in Kongens Lyngby), former MF and minister Lise-Lotte Rebel (born 1951 in Kongens Lyngby), bishop and first woman bishop in the Church of Denmark Mads Tofte (born 1959 in Kongens Lyngby), computer scientist Stine Bosse (born 1960 in Virum), businesswoman Torsten Stiig Jansen (born 1963 in Virum), journalist and diplomat Henrik Sass Larsen (born 1966 in Virum), former MF and minister Daniel Toft Jakobsen (born 1978 in Kongens Lyngby), MF Sofia Osmani (born 1979 in Virum), politician and mayor Stinus Lindgreen (born 1980), MF Art[edit] Lars von Trier Ida Brun (1792 on Sophienholm — 1857), singer, dancer and mime artist Ferdinand Richardt (1819 in Brede — 1895), artist and lithographer Elisa Marie Thornam (1857 in Kongens Lyngby — 1901), landscape painter and botanical illustrator Georg Jensen (1866 in Raadvad — 1935), silversmith and founder of Georg Jensen A/S Olga Wagner (1873 in Kongens Lyngby — 1963), painter and sculptor Karen Bramson (1875 in Taarbæk — 1936), author Dagmar Freuchen-Gale (1907 in Kongens Lyngby — 1991), illustrator, author and editor Kasper Heiberg (1928 in Kongens Lyngby — 1984), painter and sculptor Henning Moritzen (1928 in Taarbæk — 2012), actor Nina Pens Rode (1929 in Kongens Lyngby — 1992), actress Bille August (born 1948 in Brede), director, screenwriter, and cinematographer Kirsten Ortwed (born 1948 in Virum), artist and sculptor Hans Abrahamsen (born 1952 in Kongens Lyngby), composer Lars Haagensen (born 1953 in Sorgenfri), musicians and painter Lars von Trier (born 1956 in Kongens Lyngby), film director and screenwriter Søs Fenger (born 1961 in Kongens Lyngby), musician Morten Wedendahl (born 1961 in Virum), composer Sport[edit] Thomas Kristensen Sofus Rose (1894 in Kongens Lyngby — 1974), long-distance runner Margot Bærentzen (1907 in Kongens Lyngby — 1983), fencer Erling Stuer Lauridsen (1916 in Kongens Lyngby — 2012), wrestler Johan Runge (1924 in Kongens Lyngby — 2005), weightlifter Helge Hansen (1925 in Kongens Lyngby — 2008), cyclist Ib Larsen (born 1945 in Kongens Lyngby), rower Jan Popiel (born 1947 in Virum), ice hockey player Marianne Halfdan-Nielsen (born 1956 in Virum), sailor Klaus Berggreen (born 1958 in Virum), footballer John Helt (born 1959 in Virum), footballer Henrik Larsen (born 1966 in Kongens Lyngby), footballer and football manager Morten Egeblad Christoffersen (born 1968 in Virum), windsurfer Berit Christoffersen (born 1973 in Virum), rower Jakob Piil (born 1973 in Virum, bicycle racer Mikkel Beckmann (born 1983 in Virum), footballer Thomas Kristensen (born 1983 in Virum), footballer Frederik Nielsen (born 1983 in Kongens Lyngby), tennis player Nabil Aslam (born 1984 in Kongens Lyngby), footballer Jeanette Ottesen (born 1987 in Kongens Lyngby), swimmer Mai Grage (born 1992 in Kongens Lyngby), tennis player Mikkel Basse (born 1996 in Virum), footballer Jacob Bruun Larsen (born 1998 in Kongens Lyngby), footballer Christian Rasmussen (born 2003 in Kongens Lyngby), footballer References[edit] ^ ""Statistikbanken"".

It was founded in 1829 at the initiative of Hans Christian Ørsted as Denmark's first polytechnic, and it is today ranked among Europe's leading engineering institutions. Along with École Polytechnique in Paris, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Eindhoven University of Technology, Technical University of Munich and Technion – Israel Institute of Technology, DTU is a member of EuroTech Universities Alliance.[3] Contents 1 History 2 Organization and administration 2.1 Departments 2.2 Research centers 3 Campus 4 Controversy 5 Rankings 6 Extracurricular organizations 6.1 Sports 6.2 Student organizations 7 Notable alumni and faculty 8 See also 9 Notes and references 10 External links History[edit] DTU was founded in 1829 as the ""College of Advanced Technology"" (Danish: Den Polytekniske Læreanstalt). The Physicist Hans Christian Ørsted, at that time a professor at the University of Copenhagen, was one of the driving forces behind this initiative. He was inspired by the École Polytechnique in Paris, France which Ørsted had visited as a young scientist. The new institution was inaugurated on 5 November 1829 with Ørsted becoming its Principal, a position he held until his death in 1851.[4] The College of Advanced Technology's premises in Sølvgade, completed 1889 The first home of the new college consisted of two buildings located in Studiestræde and St- Pederstræde in the center of Copenhagen. Although these buildings were expanded several times, they eventually became inadequate for the requirements of the college. In 1890 a new building complex was completed and inaugurated located in Sølvgade. The new buildings were designed by the architect Johan Daniel Herholdt.[4] In 1903, the College of Advanced Technology commenced the education of electrical engineers in addition to that of the construction engineers, the production engineers, and the mechanical engineers who already at that time were being educated at the college. In the 1920s, space again became insufficient and in 1929 the foundation stone was laid for a new school at Østervold. Completion of this building was delayed by World War II and it was not completed before 1954.[4] From 1933, the institution was officially known as Danmarks tekniske Højskole (DtH), which commonly was translated into English, as the 'Technical University of Denmark'. On 1 April 1994, in connection with the joining of Danmarks Ingeniørakademi (DIA) and DTH, the Danish name was changed to Danmarks Tekniske Universitet, this done to include the word 'University' thus giving rise to the initials DTU by which the university is commonly known today. The formal name, Den Polytekniske Læreanstalt, Danmarks Tekniske Universitet, however, still includes the original name. Main building in Lyngby. R/V Dana is DTU's research vessel, visiting Ystad 18 November 2016. In 1960 a decision was made to move the College of Advanced Technology to new and larger facilities in Lyngby north of Copenhagen. They were inaugurated on 17 May 1974.[4] On 23 and 24 November 1967, the University Computing Center hosted the NATO Science Committee's Study Group first meeting discussing the newly coined term ""Software Engineering"".[5] On 1 January 2007, the university was merged with the following Danish research centers: Forskningscenter Risø, Danmarks Fødevareforskning, Danmarks Fiskeriundersøgelser (from 1 January 2008: National Institute for Aquatic Resources; DTU Aqua), Danmarks Rumcenter, and Danmarks Transport-Forskning. Organization and administration[edit] The university is governed by a board consisting of 10 members: Six members are recruited from outside the university and they form the majority of the board. One member is appointed by the scientific staff and one member is appointed by the administrative staff. Two members are appointed by the university students. The President of DTU is appointed by the university board. The President in turn appoints the Deans, and the Deans appoint the Heads of the departments. In 2014, DTU was granted institutional accreditation by the Danish Accreditation Institution (a member of ENQA). The institutional accreditation ensures that the quality assurance system of the institution is well-described, well-argued, and well-functioning in practice. Since DTU has no faculty senate, and since the faculty is not involved in the appointment of the President, Deans, or Department heads, the university has no faculty governance.[6] Departments[edit] DTU Aqua, National Institute for Aquatic Resources DTU Business, DTU Executive School of Business DTU Cen, Center for Electron Nanoscopy DTU Centre for Technology Entrepreneurship DTU Chemical Engineering, Department of Chemical and Biochemical Engineering DTU Chemistry, Department of Chemistry DTU Civil Engineering, Department of Civil Engineering DTU Compute, Institut for Matematik og Computer Science DTU Danchip, National Center for Micro and Nanofabrication DTU Diplom, Department of Bachelor Engineering DTU Electrical Engineering, Department of Electrical Engineering DTU Environment, Department of Environmental Engineering DTU Executive School of Business DTU Food, National Food Institute DTU Fotonik, Department of Photonics Engineering DTU Management Engineering, Department of Management Engineering DTU Mechanical Engineering, Department of Mechanical Engineering DTU Nanotech, Department of Micro-and Nanotechnology DTU Physics, Department of Physics Risø DTU, National Laboratory for Sustainable Energy DTU Space, National Space Institute DTU Systems Biologi, Department of Systems Biology DTU Library, Technical Information Center of Denmark DTU Vet, National Veterinary Institute DTU Wind Energi, Department of Wind Energy DTU Transport, Department of Transport: The department provides Transportation and Logistics master's degree programs in engineering and technology.

The area was previously home to the airfield Lundtofte Flyveplads. The campus is roughly divided in half by the road Anker Engelunds Vej going in the east-west direction, and, perpendicular to that, by two lengthy, collinear roads located on either side of a parking lot. The campus is thus divided into four parts, referred to as quadrants, numbered 1 through 4 in correspondence with the conventional numbering of quadrants in the Cartesian coordinate system with north upwards. Controversy[edit] DTU was the subject of controversy in 2009 because the (then) institute director of the Department of Chemistry, O.W. Sørensen,[8] was a high-ranking member of Scientology.[9] In relation to this, the university was accused of violating the principles of free speech by threatening to fire employees, among them Rolf W. Berg, who voiced their criticism of the institute director.[10][11][12][13][14][15] On 7 April 2010, the successor of Sørensen was announced, at a department meeting, as Erling Stenby,[16] who officially took over as Director on 1 May 2010.

Information Technologies and the Material Economy The diffusion of information and telecommunication technologies (ICT) resulted in several economic and social impacts. Historically, information required physical means to be diffused, implying that the domains of transportation and information diffusion were similar. For instance, postal services require physical means, making information mobility similar to freight mobility. The invention of the telegraph was the first significant technology contributing to the separation between transportation and telecommunications. Later on, the telephone, the radio, and the television would further contribute to this division by creating information networks separated from transportation networks. A new range of ICT that emerged in the 1980s contributed to a reversal of this trend by making telecommunication and transportation more integrated. These include computers, satellite communication, mobile phones, and finally, the internet. Transportation is a service that requires and processes a large amount of information. The transport sector was conventionally perceived in terms of vehicles and infrastructure managed as assets delivering value by the mobility they confer to passengers and freight. For instance, transportation users decide where and when to travel, which mode to use if they are operating their vehicle, and which routes to take. Inversely, the providers of transportation services must manage their assets so that they effectively match the demand (information) sent by various transportation markets in which they compete. Yet, the interactions between transport supply and demand are far from being efficient, which leads to enduring situations of mismatches (overcapacity, under capacity, and imperfect competition). Better sources of information and the ability to distribute information enable transportation systems to function with a higher level of efficiency because of better interaction between its supply and demand. Looking at the potential impacts of ICT, such as the Internet, may have on mobility must consider how they can support, modify, expand, or substitute the mobility of passengers and freight. It is important to underline that information technologies do not lead to a de-materialization of the economy, which is a common misconception. This is associated with a series of paradigms: Platform corporation paradigm. Usually, a corporation focuses on a set of core competencies (high-profit tasks) and outsourcing activities perceived of lower value. In the manufacturing sector, it is common to focus on product design and retailing and to rely on a network of providers to supply and assemble parts through outsourcing and offshoring. A platform corporation thus organizes the production, distribution, and retailing of the goods it sells. It indirectly and directly generates large amounts of material flows for the supply chains it manages through its information network. Still, the corporation itself may not be manufacturing any material goods.E-commerce paradigm. Online retailers have challenged the conventional paradigm in the retailing sector by acting as an intermediary between suppliers and consumers. They operate a network of e-fulfillment centers (distribution centers), storing hundreds of thousands of items, processing large volumes of orders that are then packaged and delivered by postal or parcel services. A whole array of online retailers is dependent on material flows with the distribution center as the key component of this strategy.Asset management paradigm. Elements of what has been labeled as the ‘sharing economy’ are more effective means to manage existing assets, such as real estate or vehicles, by linking providers and consumers. Even if the managing platform can be perceived as immaterial, it involves tangible assets that are more intensively used. Global Media SystemsDisconnection of Global Production and Distribution The above paradigms underline that the global economy is getting better at producing and distributing goods as well as managing existing material assets by creating extended market opportunities. At times, efficiency can be confused for immateriality because of the digital interfaces in place between assets and their users, including transportation. 2. The Digitalization of Transportation With the emergence of an information society, the transactional structures of the economy have changed drastically towards networked organizational forms of individuals, institutions, organizations, and corporations with more intensive interactions, many of which are associated with new forms of mobility. Mobility can be provided in three major forms: Modal-oriented. The direct ownership and operation of modes and terminals by corporations (owning a fleet) or individuals (owning a vehicle for exclusive use). Ownership guarantees access to mobility at any time. Digitalization involves a more efficient internal use of the assets such as tracking and navigation. Still, the optimal use is bounded by the ownership setting.Operation-oriented. The direct lease and operation of modes and terminals by corporations and individuals. Leasing guarantees access to mobility for the terms of the lease, such as time and condition. Digitalization involves making assets available across a market, reconciling supply and demand.Demand-oriented. Accessing mobility based on expected demand (for corporations) and need (for individuals). Digitalization involves accessing in real-time the availability of transportation assets to temporarily rent their use for a purpose. Mobility is supported by physical foundations, including transportation infrastructure and energy supply systems, as well as a regulatory environment. The digital foundation (or digitalization) of this mobility is becoming increasingly important as it creates new transportation markets. The three major spheres of the digitalization of transportation involve: Personal. ICT enables individuals to interact through additional mediums (e.g. email, messaging, video conferencing), which may lead to more interactions, but also to changes over how these interactions are conducted. The diffusion of mobile personal computing devices (e.g. laptops, smartphones, and tablet computers) has also enabled individuals to enrich their mobility by enabling them to perform various tasks while in transit or outside a conventional work environment setting. Several applications, such as global positioning systems, also enable individuals to manage their mobility better. The intensity and the scheduling of mobility can become highly interactive since users are able to coordinate their mobility considering real-time changes, such as congestion, or changes in time and cost preferences. The smartphone acts as a trip optimization device that has improved the efficiency of vehicles through less confusion and errors, as well as the capability to re-route because of changing traffic conditions. At the aggregate level, these improvements are substantial and could be associated with 10 to 20% in overall efficiency improvements.Consumer to business (C2B). ICT enables consumers to interact with the transportation services they use more effectively. A direct form is purchasing transport services, which are now done online through booking systems for air and rail transport and ride-sharing services. An indirect form is E-commerce, which has opened a whole new array of commercial opportunities complementing or substituting conventional shopping, from basic necessities to discretionary goods. One important convenience of e-commerce is that it removes the distance and temporal restrictions associated with conventional retailing. Customers needed to physically travel to a store, which had defined opening hours. E-commerce does not necessarily imply that there is more consumption but that a growing share of retailing transactions is taking place online, resulting in the growth of home deliveries, which are an indirect form of transportation.Business to business (B2B). ICT enables businesses to transact more effectively, which indirectly results in changes in their transport operations. The increasing scale and intensity of business transactions are commonly linked with supply chain management strategies. For instance, inventory management strategies permitted by ICT enables a greater share of the inventory to be in transit (‘stored’ in vehicles and at terminals), often in line with an increase in the frequency of deliveries. The digitalization of transportation incites the development of new platforms where actors can interact in the provision, use, and exchange of transportation services. The conventional urban mobility landscape is characterized by a patchwork of passengers and freight transportation services, which is associated with the inefficiencies of these assets. By integrating transportation service providers in an ICT platform, a new paradigm emerges, which is referred to as mobility as a service. Organizational Forms in Human SocietiesThe Digitalization of MobilityDiffusion of Personal Computing Devices, 1977-2018Digital Mobility as a ServiceThe Core Principles of BlockchainsBlockchains and Value Creation Mobility as a service concerns transactions related to transportation and supply chains. Conventionally, each actor along a transport chain tended to keep its own centralized ledger recording its information and transactions. The emergence of Blockchain technologies provides an extended and distributed form of ledgers, adding value to the process. It has the potential to improve the transactional efficiency of supply chains by enabling the providers and users of transport services to share a common and distributed electronic ledger system. Exact copies are maintained and simultaneously updated across several nodes. It becomes possible to more effectively manage access to transport infrastructures and conveyances (from a seat in a plane to a slot in a containership), the related data exchange, and payments for service provided. 3. Telecommuting and Tele-Consuming One of the ongoing tenets is that ICT can offer forms of substitution for the physical mobility of passengers and freight. When this substitution involves work-related flows, it is labeled as telecommuting, and when it involves consumption related flows, it is labeled as tele-consuming. Telecommuting. Using information and telecommunication technologies to perform work at a location away from the traditional office location and environment. Commuting is thus substituted, and it is implied that it took place remotely instead. Tele-consuming. Using information and telecommunication technologies to consume products and services that would typically require a physical flow to access. Both have been facilitated with advances in information technologies, particularly the ubiquity of high bandwidth connectivity as well as mobile devices. There are degrees of telecommuting ranging from a partial substitution where a worker may spend one or two days per week performing work at another location, to a complete substitution where the work is performed elsewhere, such as in an offshore location. The latter is much less likely as the vast majority of work tasks tend to be collaborative and require face-to-face meetings. Tele-consuming is more ambiguous and the main factor behind the perception of a dematerialized economy. For instance, many media such as books, newspapers, magazines, movies, and music used to be physically delivered and consumed; they are now mainly accessed (consumed) online. Software that used to be distributed through physical means such as disks can now be downloaded. Still, telecommuting and tele-consuming require substantial telecommunication infrastructure and networks to be effective. Telecommuting has often failed the meet expectations, and its share of total commuting movements remained low and relatively unchanged; 3 to 5% of the total workforce can be telecommuting at least once a month, but this share appears to be growing slightly. There are many reasons for this enduring low share, ranging from activities that cannot be easily substituted to a loss of direct control from management because workers are not present on site. One major factor is that if a job has the potential to be complemented by telecommuting, it is also a target to be relocated to a low-cost location either through outsourcing or offshoring. There is thus a large amount of telecommuting that took place as offshoring instead. Also, many workers use telecommuting forms to work overtime, carry extra work at home, or perform other activities that may still require transportation. Therefore, telecommuting allows employers to impose longer work hours as well as ensure employees to be more available for work on an on-call basis outside regular working hours. 4. Impacts of ICT on Mobility The potential impacts of ICT on mobility either involve a modification (different origin, destination, mode, or route), a substitution (from a physical flow to an information flow), or a generation of a movement. Such an outcome is contingent upon the socioeconomic and geographical context in which mobility is taking place. The expected impacts of ICT on the transportation sector can be summarized by the following. a. Transport substitution The rapid proliferation of ICT, such as mobile phones, intranets, and teleconferencing, promotes new forms of mobility and the possibility to substitute mobility. Reducing vehicle use is one of the expected primary benefits of ICT, as it is assumed that substitution will take place, or those vehicle assets will be used more efficiently. Yet, substitution remains relatively marginal for the physical mobility of people. ICT has permitted additional forms of non-physical interactions. The most important substitution effect has been on postal services where online methods of communication and tele-consumption have been associated with a substantial decline in physical mail volumes and their associated transportation activities. While there were in 1990, about 268 billion mail items sent in the United States, this figure dropped to 146 billion in 2018, in spite of ongoing population growth. Another important form of transport substitution concerns e-commerce where for an online transaction, in-store purchases have been substituted by home deliveries. The Substitution and Generation Effects of Information Technologies on MobilityMail Carried by USPS and Parcels Carried by Major Carriers, United States, 2004-2018 b. Navigation and tracking While navigation devices have been available for a while, the combination of global positioning systems, wireless communication technology to access the internet, and mobile computing devices enabled advanced forms of dynamic navigation and tracking. Navigation assistance and real-time information about traffic conditions provide accurate estimates about travel times and offer the possibility of alternate routes in case of disruptive events. It is estimated that one billion drivers worldwide are using navigation apps. At the aggregate level, this has enabled notable time and fuel savings by road users, both for passengers and freight transport. Assisted navigation also creates challenges such as allocating vehicles on local streets, which can exacerbate local congestion and dealing with disruptions such as school opening hours. It is now possible to track the location of vehicles and consignments, enabling them to better estimate times of arrival or delivery or improve fuel consumption. For temperature-sensitive goods, it becomes possible to monitor the condition of their transport. Tracking, as an inventory management strategy, also allows for more flexible use of transportation since a consignment can be differed or re-routed if demand changes. For containers, industry standards such as Track and Trace (T&T) are being introduced. It defines processes, data, and interface standards that allow stakeholders such as carriers, shippers, and third-party logistics services providers to interact and track containers and their shipments across several modes. A forthcoming change concerns self-driving vehicles that are only commercially implementable if they are provided a substantial amount of real-time information about the environment they navigate in through on-board sensors, but also with information feeds supported by ICT. The large diffusion of self-driving vehicles would have substantial impacts on the transport system, reducing the number of vehicles required to meet the existing demand, enhancing the mobility of those that may have physical or financial impairments, reducing the risks of accidents and improving the time and cost performance of passenger and freight flows alike. c. Mobility as service markets Conventionally, many transportation markets could only have been booked through intermediaries such as travel agents or freight forwarders. The development of the internet has enabled users to book transportation services such as for air, train, and bus travel directly, commonly referred to as mobility as a service. For the airline industry, these changes have been substantial, promoting competition and the convenience of air travel with the possibility to check-in online and even use a mobile device to carry a virtual boarding pass. A similar trend has taken place with rail services, particularly high-speed rail, but this is also entering the mass transit market, including bike rental services. An indirect benefit is a drop in the consumption of resources and energy for issuing travel documents such as tickets, boarding passes, or bills of lading. This also reduces the time passengers spend at terminals queuing. More recently, the diffusion of ride-sharing services (e.g. Uber, Lyft, Didi), as well as car rental services, has opened an entirely new array of opportunities expanding the capacity to connect suppliers of transport services and customers. These services have been highly disruptive for the conventional taxi industry since they are competing directly with them. For public transit, ride-sharing appears to be both competing and complementary. Online commercial platforms are also developing opportunities for the freight sector, enabling providers of freight transport services such as shipping lines or trucking companies to auction services or bid for an offered transport demand. In 2019, the giant e-commerce retailer Amazon started a digital freight brokerage platform, which was able to reduce spot market prices by at least 25%. On a smaller scale, it is also possible for individuals to offer services like ride-sharing, but concerning the deliveries of packages, groceries, and even meals. d. Transport asset management ICT supported transportation services such as ride-sharing results in better management of vehicles, routes, and assets (higher load factor, more trips per vehicle, fewer vehicles for the same capacity, etc.). This is particularly the case with freight distribution with the application of logistics supporting better levels of inventory management and more reliable deliveries. There are numerous applications of ICT in transportation asset management. One concerns appointment systems to terminals (ports and rail yards) and distribution centers. Users can use an online platform to reserve an access time slot to the facility, which should improve the efficiency of both the terminal and the vehicle assets. Just-in-time inventory management, which reduces inventory requirements, would not be possible without significant ICT support, including the ongoing automation of modes, terminals, and distribution facilities. Blockchains can support the complexity of intermodal transportation systems by allowing better synchronization of modes and terminals. Yield management and congestion pricing are also common to better manage available capacity in conditions of high demand, but this requires accurate real-time information about demand and supply characteristics. In the case of yield management, for instance, an airline can dynamically change the pricing of its seats and even request booked customers to delay their travel in exchange for compensation. Retail Logistics and E-commercePotential Benefits of On Demand Services Compared with Conventional Taxi ServicesNumber of Monthly Trips by for Hire Services, New York City, 2015-2019Forms of Transport Automation Although mobility itself has not changed, since it remains passengers or freight flows, ICT has impacted mobility in a variety of ways, often making it more efficient. It is increasingly able to offer a form of substitution to the mobility of passengers and freight, to navigate in a changing environment (e.g. variations in the level of congestion) as well as tracking and managing transportation assets. However, ICT can also have unintended negative consequences. Since 2010, an increase in pedestrian fatalities was observed, particularly in the United States. The main factor for this increase was attributed to distractions created by using portable devices while walking.  A similar observation applies where mobile devices are providing a hazardous distraction to drivers trying to use them while operating their vehicles. This all said, there is also the potential to exaggerate the impacts of ICT on mobility, as the issue of telecommuting underlined. 5. ICT and Location In addition to substitution and mobility issues, ICT has an impact on the location and the operations of economic activities. The most important forces are those of decentralization and relocation. Organizational structures are being transformed from a hierarchy to a network of collaborators. This commonly results in management, which is more flexible and able to adapt to market changes, including new sourcing strategies. ICT improves locational flexibility by offering a wider array of locational choices for administrative, retail, and freight-related activities. This helps lower office and retail footprints by decentralizing some tasks to a lower-cost environment, such as the suburbs or at home, or by permitting their complete relocation (offshoring) to low-cost locations. ICT is, therefore, a corporate strategy to improve the productivity of labor and assets through higher locational flexibility. Central locations and larger building sizes have dominated retailing and offices since the 1950s. Indeed, newer and larger stores overtook smaller rivals and established new distribution structures based on mass retailing. The standard 2,000 square feet market of the 1950s became the 20,000 square feet supermarket in the 1960s and evolved into the 50,000 square feet superstore of the 1990s. The real estate footprint of retail increased substantially during that period, particularly in North America. Following a similar trend, the small office of a company has become several floors in a skyscraper located in downtown areas. The amount of space devoted to administrative functions has increased significantly. ICT is changing the retailing sector by rendering some location structures obsolete and by minimizing inventory costs. The impacts of e-commerce are particularly salient since they permitted new forms of distribution and new retailing forms. Since the distribution center is taking a core role for e-commerce, suburban locations are becoming the setting for new types of facilities such as e-fulfillment and sortation centers. Most corporations use ICT to reduce costs. For office-related activities, the costs of providing office space to employees are very high, far more than just the cost of leasing or building the space and maintaining it. It also concerns parking, which tends to be more expensive in high-density areas often related to the clustering office activities. In some cases, it can run as high as 20 to 30% of disbursed salaries per employee. A common outcome is to outsource or offshore the job instead of focusing on telecommuting. For retail, the most important cost is renting store space, leading to the conventional paradox that the locations that could generate the highest sales volumes were also those commanding the highest rents. A factor behind the competitiveness of online retailing firms is their lower rent structure because their footprint is more focused on distribution centers in lower-cost locations. They do not have the burden to maintain a retail presence in high-cost locations. Information Technologies and the Corporate StructureLogistics Facilities Supporting E-commerceComparison Between Retail and E-commerce Cost Structures for a $150 Apparel PieceKey Information Technology Drivers in Freight Distribution ICT has thus become a force shaping land use and transportation. Cheaper space in the suburbs is an important requirement for newer and smaller firms that are users of telecommunications technologies. A similar observation can be made concerning the distributional structures related to e-commerce, in which fulfillment centers have suburban and exurban locations. The growing capability of ICT allows businesses and other organizations locational flexibility and better tracking, asset management, and regulatory compliance of transport systems.

Webinar Archives Creating a Visual Engagement Strategy in a Government Organization (Jan. 5, 2017) The world has gone visual. YouTube.com, Facebook, Twitter—all focusing on video and visual content. By the end of 2017, nearly 70% of ALL internet traffic will be video. Video is 600% more effective than print. Printed newspapers are a relic from the 19th century and are dropping like flies. So why do we in government still love print and avoid video and visuals to tell our story? Don’t let cost or ability stop you. There is a way to reach beyond the news media filter to tell compelling stories directly to your customers and stakeholders using visuals and video. Emmy® Award-winning journalist and 2016 NAGC Best of Show-winning government communicator Tom Fuller shares the secret sauce to make your organization’s messages cut through the clutter. It’s not just about creating the same boring 10 minute government-y videos either. It’s a strategy you can learn, refine, and implement back home.

By transport one can think of means to carry, move, or convey people from one place to another such as cars, motorbikes, bicycles, boats, etc. or animals used with purpose of conveying people. By communication one can think of a  hardware system, such as mail, telephone, radio, television, or computer for sending and receiving messages. With these practical means more people in often remote communities can be supported. Liliane Foundation and MIVA The Liliane Foundation and MIVA join hands to contribute towards a more inclusive society in which vulnerable and marginalized groups such as children with disabilities can participate to the best of their abilities, develop their potential and enjoy full implementation of their human rights. Reliable means of transportation and communication are essential for local organisations in order to support these people who often live in rural and remote poor areas. Best practices Thanks to the support of MIVA, our partner organisations are able to purchase a variety of means of transport/communication in order to improve their programmes and activities. Based on the experiences a number of best practices are listed below: More mobility and independence from others. Save on time and resources and improve quality of services. Possibility to improve and increase monitoring visits and individual home based counselling. Improvement of communication thanks to different communication means. Case from India: Sisters of the Cross of Chanavod The Congregation of the Sisters of the Cross of Chavanod supports socially and economically abandoned people in the region of Makkuva, in the Vizianagaram district (Andhra Pradesh state). The region is mountainous. Villages are quite isolated and at long distances from one another. A new bus, funded by MIVA, enables the Congregation to attend to the needs of 186 children with disabilities throughout the region. Furthermore, the bus helps the Sisters to support 200 families affected and infected by HIV/AIDS. The programme coordinators and field staff use the vehicle for many purposes: Family and community visits Health awareness programmes in the communities Rehabilitation services in villages for children with mental and physical disabilities Transport of children with disabilities to the daycare center Women’s group meetings to create awareness on social issues Emergency transports to hospital School transport for children during the rain season Transport of food and materials for the Sisters of the Cross children’s home Other areas of expertise We are continuously expanding our expertise in these themes to facilitate our Partner Organizations. • Community Based Rehabilitation • Inclusive Education • Sustainable Livelihood • Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights Theme expert For more information about our activities on Transport and communication, please contact our theme expert.

Oquist became Executive Director in June 2015 after serving as Strategy Director since 2014.[citation needed] Oquist is a regular guest on Agenda (Sky News Australia), The Drum, and a regular column writer for outlets including Guardian Australia,[1] Crikey[2] and the ABC.[3] In October 2018, The Australian Financial Review listed Oquist and Richard Denniss of The Australia Institute in equal tenth-place on their 'Covert Power' list of the most powerful people in Australia.[4] Contents 1 Career 1.1 The Australian Greens 1.2 The Australia Institute 1.2.1 Al Gore, Clive Palmer and carbon tax repeal 2 References 3 External links Career[edit] A 15-year career with Greens leader Bob Brown was broken briefly by a two-year stint with the public affairs company Essential Media Communications.[5][6] Joining The Australia Institute staff in 2014, he became Executive Director in 2015. The Australian Greens[edit] Oquist began working with the Australian Greens in 1996 for both Dee Margetts and Bob Brown. Brown has described Oquist as a ""friend and confidant"" but also as ""a core factor in the Greens becoming the third largest party in Australian politics"".[7] In a 2014 radio interview Brown stated that Oquist's approach to strategy aligned with that of his own.[8] Oquist was reported to have been favoured by Brown for preselection as Greens senator for NSW in 2003.[9] Upon the resignation of Senator Bob Brown on 13 April 2012, Oquist became chief of staff for the new leader, Christine Milne. In September 2013, Oquist was implicated in an attempt to unseat the then leader of the Australian Greens, Christine Milne.[10] It was reported that Oquist was motivated to attempt to remove Milne before she restructured the organisation to remove his influence.[11] Senator Milne had described him as an adherent to a hierarchical administrative structure, citing this as the reason behind his subsequent departure from his role on the Greens staff.[10] His subsequent commencement with the Australia Institute aligned him with the economist and then Executive Director of the Australia Institute Richard Denniss. Denniss was also an outspoken critic of Christine Milne and a former Australian Greens staffer.[6] Oquist was widely sourced for comment on the occasion of the resignation of Christine Milne as leader of the Australian Greens in May 2015, where he praised her role as a climate leader.[12][13] The Australia Institute[edit] Al Gore, Clive Palmer and carbon tax repeal[edit] In July 2014 Oquist, at that time a strategy director of The Australia Institute, was named as a party to the meeting between former US Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore and Clive Palmer.[14] The meeting was instrumental in a deal brokered between the leader of the Palmer United Party, Clive Palmer, and the federal government of Australia for the concessional repeal of the carbon tax.[15] Oquist's role in the context of the repeal was widely reported to be one of pragmatism, driven by a focus on gaining support in particular for the mandated Renewable Energy Target which in 2014 was thought to be under imminent threat.[16][6] Following the demise of the Palmer United Party senate voting block in 2014 the deal collapsed.[17] However, the newly constituted Senate crossbench did not vote to repeal the RET.[18] [19] The Carbon Pricing Scheme was abolished on 17 July 2014. Oquist's role in these events remains controversial as Palmer stood to benefit financially from the repeal through his ownership of a coal refinery.

The institute consists of members who support the Labor party and Unions, who advocate the welfare of the working class. The Australia Institute is based in Canberra, Australian Capital Territory. Contents 1 Philosophy 2 Research 2.1 Climate change and energy 2.2 Tax reform debate 2.3 Centre for Future Work 2.4 The Australia Institute Tasmania 3 Funding 4 Directors 5 References 6 External links Philosophy[edit] The Australia Institute describes itself as ""one of the country’s most influential think tanks"", as well as saying that:The Institute is determined to push public debate beyond the simplistic question of whether markets or governments have all the answers to more important questions: When does government need to intervene in the market? When should it stand back? And when regulation is needed, what form should it take?[2] The Australia Institute has been variously described as left-leaning,[3] independent,[4] progressive[5][6] or centrist.[7] Research[edit] The Australia Institute's researchers are prominent commentators on public policy issues, including work on climate change and energy, emissions trading, taxation policy and inequality. The Australia Institute is also known for its work on environment, taxation, health, consumer affairs and trade practices.[citation needed] Climate change and energy[edit] The Australia Institute is active in promoting global warming mitigation measures, and has been critical of the Australian federal government's perceived lack of action on climate change. The Australia Institute was critical of the Howard Government's decision to refuse to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. It claims that the former Prime Minister and some senior ministers deny the scientific evidence for global warming and that the resources sector drives government energy policy. Leaked minutes of a meeting between the Energy Minister, the Prime Minister and fossil fuel lobbyists provide evidence for these claims.[8][9] The Australia Institute has been active in promoting renewable energy development, and other mitigation measures, and it has campaigned strongly against developing a nuclear industry in Australia.[10] The Australia Institute criticised the Rudd Government's proposed Australian emissions trading scheme (or Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme), arguing that it failed to adequately take into account voluntary action and delivered excessive compensation to polluting industries.[11] The Australia Institute spoke positively of the design of the carbon price mechanism implemented by the Gillard Government, arguing that beginning with a fixed price and transitioning to an emissions trading scheme made sense given that there was no consensus about what the emissions reduction target should be.[12] In 2014, Ben Oquist (then the Australia Institute's Strategy Director) was involved in the Palmer United Party's decision to vote against the abolition of the Renewable Energy Target, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Climate Change Authority.[13] Oquist wrote that ""The Australia Institute is disappointed that the carbon price is likely to be repealed"" but that ""The Palmer-Gore announcement has re-set climate policy and politics. Keeping the CCA, the RET and the CEFC is much more than most expected from the PUP. We have avoided a big step backwards.""[14] In 2017, the Australia Institute reported that Australia's greenhouse gas emissions were ""rising rapidly"" since the abolition of the carbon price, with economist Matt Grudnoff criticising the National Energy Guarantee proposed by the Turnbull Government, saying that it would be “likely to cause our emissions to rise even faster”.[15] In 2017, The Australia Institute took over The Climate Institute's intellectual property after that institute closed, and subsequently launched a Climate and Energy Program to continue the work.[16][17] The first Climate of the Nation report produced by The Australia Institute was released in 2018. Tax reform debate[edit] The Australia Institute employs several economists[18] who have published papers arguing for tax reform, particularly in the areas of superannuation tax concessions, negative gearing, capital gains tax and goods and services tax.[19] During the 2016 Australian federal election, the Institute published a series of critiques of the Coalition's proposed policy of cutting the company tax rate.[20] The Australia Institute has also criticised the final two stages of the Turnbull Government's three-stage income tax cut plan, releasing research into how the benefits from the tax cut are distributed by income [21] and electorate.[22] Centre for Future Work[edit] In 2016, the Australia Institute set up the Centre for Future of Work ""to conduct and publish progressive economic research on work, employment, and labour markets"".[23] Its founding director is Canadian economist Dr Jim Stanford. The Australia Institute Tasmania[edit] In 2017, the Australia Institute established The Australia Institute Tasmania with director Leanne Minshull, to ""look at political, social and economic issues on a state level, and release research and polling on government policies and issues of the day"".[24] Funding[edit] The Australia Institute had a total gross income of $4.46 Million[25] in 2020 and is independently funded by donations from philanthropic trusts and individuals, as well as grants and commissioned research from business, unions and non-government organisations. In its first decade through to 2003, the Australia Institute was largely funded by the Poola Foundation and the Treepot Foundation—philanthropic organisations run by the Kantors.[3] Other significant funders include the McKinnon Family Foundation; David Morawetz’s Social Justice Fund, a sub fund of the Australian Communities Foundation; Diana and Brian Snape AM and the Susan McKinnon Foundation.[26] In recent years, the Australia Institute has reported the number of donations it has received from individuals, with 2,000 individual donors in financial year 2015 [27] and 2,700 in financial year 2017.[28] The Australia Institute does not accept donations or commissioned work from political parties.[2] Directors[edit] Dr John McKinnon (Chair), NGO director and philanthropist Ms Alex Sloan, award winning journalist, interviewer and facilitator Mr Andrew Dettmer, National President of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union Professor Asmi Wood, Australian National University College of law.

242,"The Australia Institute - Wikipedia The Australia Institute From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Organization ‹ The template Infobox organization is being considered for merging. › The Australia InstituteAbbreviationThe Australia InstituteFormation4 May 1994[1]TypePublic policy think tankDirectorBen OquistWebsitetai.org.au The Australia Institute is a progressive Australian think tank conducting public policy research on a broad range of economic, social, transparency and environmental issues in order to inform public debate and bring greater accountability to the democratic process. The institute consists of members who support the Labor party and Unions, who advocate the welfare of the working class. The Australia Institute is based in Canberra, Australian Capital Territory. Contents 1 Philosophy 2 Research 2.1 Climate change and energy 2.2 Tax reform debate 2.3 Centre for Future Work 2.4 The Australia Institute Tasmania 3 Funding 4 Directors 5 References 6 External links Philosophy[edit] The Australia Institute describes itself as ""one of the country’s most influential think tanks"", as well as saying that:The Institute is determined to push public debate beyond the simplistic question of whether markets or governments have all the answers to more important questions: When does government need to intervene in the market? When should it stand back? And when regulation is needed, what form should it take?[2] The Australia Institute has been variously described as left-leaning,[3] independent,[4] progressive[5][6] or centrist.[7] Research[edit] The Australia Institute's researchers are prominent commentators on public policy issues, including work on climate change and energy, emissions trading, taxation policy and inequality. The Australia Institute is also known for its work on environment, taxation, health, consumer affairs and trade practices.[citation needed] Climate change and energy[edit] The Australia Institute is active in promoting global warming mitigation measures, and has been critical of the Australian federal government's perceived lack of action on climate change. The Australia Institute was critical of the Howard Government's decision to refuse to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. It claims that the former Prime Minister and some senior ministers deny the scientific evidence for global warming and that the resources sector drives government energy policy. Leaked minutes of a meeting between the Energy Minister, the Prime Minister and fossil fuel lobbyists provide evidence for these claims.[8][9] The Australia Institute has been active in promoting renewable energy development, and other mitigation measures, and it has campaigned strongly against developing a nuclear industry in Australia.[10] The Australia Institute criticised the Rudd Government's proposed Australian emissions trading scheme (or Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme), arguing that it failed to adequately take into account voluntary action and delivered excessive compensation to polluting industries.[11] The Australia Institute spoke positively of the design of the carbon price mechanism implemented by the Gillard Government, arguing that beginning with a fixed price and transitioning to an emissions trading scheme made sense given that there was no consensus about what the emissions reduction target should be.[12] In 2014, Ben Oquist (then the Australia Institute's Strategy Director) was involved in the Palmer United Party's decision to vote against the abolition of the Renewable Energy Target, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Climate Change Authority.[13] Oquist wrote that ""The Australia Institute is disappointed that the carbon price is likely to be repealed"" but that ""The Palmer-Gore announcement has re-set climate policy and politics. Keeping the CCA, the RET and the CEFC is much more than most expected from the PUP. We have avoided a big step backwards.""[14] In 2017, the Australia Institute reported that Australia's greenhouse gas emissions were ""rising rapidly"" since the abolition of the carbon price, with economist Matt Grudnoff criticising the National Energy Guarantee proposed by the Turnbull Government, saying that it would be “likely to cause our emissions to rise even faster”.[15] In 2017, The Australia Institute took over The Climate Institute's intellectual property after that institute closed, and subsequently launched a Climate and Energy Program to continue the work.[16][17] The first Climate of the Nation report produced by The Australia Institute was released in 2018. Tax reform debate[edit] The Australia Institute employs several economists[18] who have published papers arguing for tax reform, particularly in the areas of superannuation tax concessions, negative gearing, capital gains tax and goods and services tax.[19] During the 2016 Australian federal election, the Institute published a series of critiques of the Coalition's proposed policy of cutting the company tax rate.[20] The Australia Institute has also criticised the final two stages of the Turnbull Government's three-stage income tax cut plan, releasing research into how the benefits from the tax cut are distributed by income [21] and electorate.[22] Centre for Future Work[edit] In 2016, the Australia Institute set up the Centre for Future of Work ""to conduct and publish progressive economic research on work, employment, and labour markets"".[23] Its founding director is Canadian economist Dr Jim Stanford. The Australia Institute Tasmania[edit] In 2017, the Australia Institute established The Australia Institute Tasmania with director Leanne Minshull, to ""look at political, social and economic issues on a state level, and release research and polling on government policies and issues of the day"".[24] Funding[edit] The Australia Institute had a total gross income of $4.46 Million[25] in 2020 and is independently funded by donations from philanthropic trusts and individuals, as well as grants and commissioned research from business, unions and non-government organisations. In its first decade through to 2003, the Australia Institute was largely funded by the Poola Foundation and the Treepot Foundation—philanthropic organisations run by the Kantors.[3] Other significant funders include the McKinnon Family Foundation; David Morawetz’s Social Justice Fund, a sub fund of the Australian Communities Foundation; Diana and Brian Snape AM and the Susan McKinnon Foundation.[26] In recent years, the Australia Institute has reported the number of donations it has received from individuals, with 2,000 individual donors in financial year 2015 [27] and 2,700 in financial year 2017.[28] The Australia Institute does not accept donations or commissioned work from political parties.[2] Directors[edit] Dr John McKinnon (Chair), NGO director and philanthropist Ms Alex Sloan, award winning journalist, interviewer and facilitator Mr Andrew Dettmer, National President of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union Professor Asmi Wood, Australian National University College of law. Dr Elizabeth Cham, former CEO of Philanthropy Australia (96-06) Dr Elizabeth Hill, Senior Lecturer, Political economy at the University of Sydney Mr Josh Bornstein, Head of National Employment and Industrial Law at Maurice Blackburn Lawyers Former board members include: Lin Hatfield Dodds, National Director, UnitingCare Australia Sarah Maddison (Chair), Senior Associate Dean, School of Politics and International Relations, University of New South Wales Tony McMichael, Professor, National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health, Australian National University Meredith Edwards, Emeritus Professor, University of Canberra Sharan Burrow, President, Australian Council of Trade Unions Mark Wootton, Principal and Manager of Jigsaw Farms and Director of the Poola Charitable Foundation Hugh Saddler, Managing Director, Energy Strategies Limited Gerardine (Ged) Kearney, President, Australian Council of Trade Unions Ben Oquist, Executive Director, The Australia Institute Richard Denniss, Chief Economist, The Australia Institute Lee Thomas, Federal Secretary, Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation Max Neutze, Professor, Urban Research Program, Australian National University, inaugural chair Dr David Morawetz, Clinical/Counseling Psychologist, Founder/Director of the Social Justice Fund Professor Barbara Pocock (Deputy Chair), Director, Centre for Work and Life, University of South Australia References[edit] ^ Kirby, Michael.

Close modal What We Lead With: 1 Purpose and Principles Leading with purpose means examining why it is you do what you do—and that isn’t to make a profit. Purpose sets forth intentions that will make a tangible difference in the world. But purpose alone is not enough. It might be a starting point, but leaders need a strong set of principles to bring their purpose to life. And at this crucial turning point for leadership, we believe there are three principles leaders must holistically and boldly embrace: sustainability, equality and accountability. 2 Humility Leaders operating with humility have an honest understanding of their strengths and limitations. They are not seeking to be the hero of their company, but rather a part of a community. A humble leader actively and continually admits to their imperfections while seeking to learn and grow. 3 Courage Courageous leaders are willing to take a personal risk for what is right and use their voice when it matters most. They choose to take the often difficult yet more rewarding path. They acknowledge that the global economic model is broken, but it did not break itself and they have a responsibility to repair it.

The public is calling for it, future generations will depend on it. As leaders and actors within the global economy, we must bear the responsibility to bring this vision to life. We’re working to redefine the culture of accountability in business, for our companies, communities and future generations, by creating and cascading new norms of corporate leadership that can build a better world. As we work toward our vision of the future, a future where business is a force for good, we must face the policies, practices and mindsets that have brought us to a world of broken trust, rapidly rising temperatures and increasing inequality. We must confront the crisis of conformity in leadership. We believe a new formula for leadership is needed if we are to successfully navigate these challenges. We need bold and brave leaders, willing and able to transform their own practices by embracing purpose-driven and holistic leadership, with humanity at the heart, aligned with the principles of sustainability, equality and accountability. Bold Vision, Brave Action: Our Strategy To build this new way of leading, we need business to align around both a bold vision of it and the brave action it’ll require. Since our start, we've rallied behind a future where the purpose of business is to drive inclusive social, environmental and economic benefit. We continue to support business as a force for the well-being of people and our planet—creating new norms of corporate leadership. Looking ahead, we believe the need to build an inclusive economy is more urgent than ever before. The challenges to achieve it are formidable, but we must commit business to an economic future that serves all people.That’s why we’ve come together to craft a five-year strategy to set out our inclusive economy vision and inform the plans, actions and decisions we’ll take forward through to 2025.

A. H. Branson (grandfather)Vanessa Branson (sister)Signature Sir Richard Charles Nicholas Branson (born 18 July 1950)[2] is an English business magnate, investor, and author.[3][4][5] In the 1970s he founded the Virgin Group, which today controls more than 400 companies in various fields.[6] Branson expressed his desire to become an entrepreneur at a young age. His first business venture, at the age of 16, was a magazine called Student. In 1970, he set up a mail-order record business. He opened a chain of record stores, Virgin Records—later known as Virgin Megastores—in 1972. Branson's Virgin brand grew rapidly during the 1980s, as he started Virgin Atlantic airline and expanded the Virgin Records music label. In 1997, Branson founded the Virgin Rail Group to bid for passenger rail franchises during the privatisation of British Rail. The Virgin Trains brand operated the InterCity West Coast franchise from 1997 to 2019, the InterCity CrossCountry franchise from 1997 to 2007, and the InterCity East Coast franchise from 2015 to 2018. In 2004, he founded spaceflight corporation Virgin Galactic, based at Mojave Air and Space Port in California, noted for the SpaceShipTwo suborbital spaceplane designed for space tourism. In March 2000, Branson was knighted at Buckingham Palace for ""services to entrepreneurship"".[7] For his work in retail, music and transport (with interests in land, air, sea and space travel), his taste for adventure and for his humanitarian work, he has become a prominent global figure.[8][9] In 2007, he was placed in the Time 100 Most Influential People in the World list. In July 2021, Forbes listed Branson's estimated net worth at US$5.7 billion.[10] On 11 July 2021, Branson travelled as a passenger onboard Virgin Galactic Unity 22 at the edge of space, a suborbital test flight for his spaceflight company Virgin Galactic.[11][12] The mission lasted approximately one hour, reaching a peak altitude of 53.5 miles (86.1 km). At 71, Branson is the third oldest person to fly to space.[13] Contents 1 Early life 2 Early business career 3 Virgin 3.1 1972–1980: Founding of Virgin Records 3.2 1981–1987: Package holiday industries and Virgin Atlantic Airways success 3.3 1988–2000: Telecoms ventures, railways, and worldwide impact 3.4 2001–2007: Entry into space travel and Virgin Media 3.5 2008–2019: Hotels, healthcare and charitable influence 3.6 2020–present: COVID-19 pandemic difficulties and further space ambitions 4 Failed business ventures 5 World record attempts 6 Television, film and print 7 Humanitarian initiatives 7.1 Climate change pledge 8 Politics 9 Honours and awards 10 Controversies 10.1 Tax evasion 10.2 Promotion of SeaWorld 10.3 Assault claim 11 Personal life 12 Influences 13 Bibliography 14 Notes 15 References 16 External links Early life[edit] Branson was born in Blackheath, London, to Eve Branson (née Evette Huntley Flindt; 1924–2021), a former ballet dancer and air hostess, and Edward James Branson (1918–2011), a barrister.[14][15] He has two younger sisters, Lindy Branson and Vanessa Branson.[16] His grandfather, Sir George Arthur Harwin Branson, was a judge of the High Court of Justice and a Privy Councillor.[17] His third great-grandfather, John Edward Branson, left England for India in 1793; John Edward's father, Harry Wilkins Branson, later joined him in Madras. From 1793, four generations of his family were at Cuddalore Tamilnadu. On the show Finding Your Roots, Branson was shown to have 3.9% South Asian (Indian) DNA, likely through intermarriage.[15] Later, he stated that one of his great-great-great-grandmothers was an Indian named Ariya.[18] Branson was educated at Scaitcliffe School, a prep school in Surrey, before briefly attending Cliff View House School in Sussex.[19] He attended Stowe School, an independent school in Buckinghamshire until the age of sixteen.[19] Branson has dyslexia, and had poor academic performance; on his last day at school, his headmaster, Robert Drayson, told him he would either end up in prison or become a millionaire.[20][19] Branson's parents were supportive of his endeavours from an early age.[21] His mother was an entrepreneur; one of her most successful ventures was building and selling wooden tissue boxes and wastepaper bins.[22] In London, he started off squatting from 1967 to 1968.[23] Early business career[edit] After failed attempts to grow and sell both Christmas trees and budgerigars, Branson launched a magazine named Student in 1966 with Nik Powell. The first issue of Student appeared in January 1968, and a year later, Branson's net worth was estimated at £50,000. The office for the venture was situated in the crypt of St. John's Church, off Bayswater Road, in London.[24] Though not initially as successful as he hoped, the magazine later became a vital component of the mail-order record business Branson started from the same church he used for Student. Branson used the magazine to advertise popular albums, driving his record sales.[25] He interviewed several prominent personalities of the late 1960s for the magazine including Mick Jagger and R. D. Laing.[26] Branson took over full direction of Student after successfully bluffing to Powell that the workers at the magazine opposed Powell's plans to turn the magazine into a cooperative.[27][28] His business sold records for considerably less than the ""High Street"" outlets, especially the chain WHSmith. Branson once said, ""There is no point in starting your own business unless you do it out of a sense of frustration.""[29] At the time, many products were sold under restrictive marketing agreements that limited discounting, despite efforts in the 1950s and 1960s to limit retail price maintenance.[note 1] Branson eventually started a record shop in Oxford Street in London. In 1971, he was questioned in connection with the selling of records declared export stock. The matter was never brought before a court because Branson agreed to repay any unpaid purchase tax of 33% and a £70,000 fine. His parents re-mortgaged the family home to help pay the settlement.[26] Virgin[edit] Main articles: Virgin Group and Timeline of Richard Branson's business ventures 1972–1980: Founding of Virgin Records[edit] The Manor Studio, Richard Branson's recording studio in the manor house at the village of Shipton-on-Cherwell in Oxfordshire In 1972, using money earned from his record store, Branson launched the record label Virgin Records with Nik Powell. The name ""Virgin"" was suggested by one of Branson's early employees because they were all new at business.[30] Branson bought a country estate north of Oxford in which he installed a residential recording studio, The Manor Studio.[31] He leased studio time to fledgling artists, including multi-instrumentalist Mike Oldfield, whose debut album Tubular Bells (1973) was the first release for Virgin Records and became a chart-topping best-seller.[32] Virgin signed controversial bands such as the Sex Pistols, which other companies were reluctant to sign. Virgin Records would go on to sign other artists including the Rolling Stones, Peter Gabriel, XTC, Japan, UB40, Steve Winwood and Paula Abdul, and to become the world's largest independent record label.[33] It also won praise for exposing the public to such lesser known avant-garde music as Faust and Can. Virgin Records also introduced Culture Club to the music world. Branson's net worth was estimated at £5 million by 1979, and a year later, Virgin Records went international.[citation needed] 1981–1987: Package holiday industries and Virgin Atlantic Airways success[edit] Virgin Atlantic Airbus A340 approaching London Heathrow in June 2015 Branson's first successful entry into the airline industry was during a trip to Puerto Rico. His flight was cancelled, so he decided to charter his own plane the rest of the way and offered a ride to the rest of the stranded passengers for a small fee to cover the cost.[34] In 1982, Virgin purchased the gay nightclub Heaven. In 1991, in a consortium with David Frost, Branson made an unsuccessful bid for three ITV franchises under the CPV-TV name. The early 1980s also saw his only attempt as a producer—on the novelty record ""Baa, Baa, Black Sheep"", by Singing Sheep in association with Doug McLean and Grace McDonald. The recording was a series of sheep baa-ing along to a drum-machine-produced track and reached number 42 in the UK charts in 1982.[35] Branson formed Virgin Atlantic and Virgin Cargo in 1984. He formed Virgin Holidays in 1985. 1988–2000: Telecoms ventures, railways, and worldwide impact[edit] Virgin Trains West Coast Class 390 Pendolino at Lichfield in August 2011 In 1992, to keep his airline company afloat, Branson sold the Virgin label to EMI for £500 million.[36] Branson said that he wept when the sale was completed because the record business had been the very start of the Virgin empire. He created V2 Records in 1996 to re-enter the music business, owning 5% himself.[37] Virgin also acquired European short-haul airline Euro Belgian Airlines and renamed it Virgin Express. In 1997, Branson took what many saw as being one of his riskier business exploits by entering into the railway business during the privatisation of British Rail in the late 1990s. Virgin Rail Group won the InterCity CrossCountry and InterCity West Coast franchises, beginning operations in January and March 1997 respectively.[38][39] Both franchises were scheduled to run for 15 years.[40][41] A series of disputes in the early 1990s caused tension between Virgin Atlantic and British Airways, which viewed Virgin as an emerging competitor. Virgin subsequently accused British Airways of poaching its passengers, hacking its computers, and leaking stories to the press that portrayed Virgin negatively. After the so-called campaign of ""dirty tricks"", British Airways settled the case, giving £500,000 to Branson, a further £110,000 to his airline, and had to pay legal fees of up to £3 million. Branson distributed his compensation (the so-called ""BA bonus"") among his staff.[42] Branson launched Virgin Mobile in 1999, and airline Virgin Blue in Australia in 2000.[43] 2001–2007: Entry into space travel and Virgin Media[edit] On 25 September 2004, Branson announced the signing of a deal under which a new space tourism company, Virgin Galactic, will license the technology behind SpaceShipOne—funded by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and designed by aeronautical engineer Burt Rutan—to take paying passengers into suborbital outer space. Virgin Galactic plans to make flights available to the public with tickets priced at US$200,000 using the Scaled Composites White Knight Two.[44] The spacecraft, SpaceShipTwo, is manufactured by The Spaceship Company, which was founded by Branson and Rutan and is now solely owned by Virgin Galactic. In 2013, Branson said that he planned to take his two children, 31-year-old Holly and 28-year-old Sam, on a trip to outer space when they ride the SpaceShipTwo rocket plane on its first public flight, then planned for 2014.[45] As part of his promotion of the firm, Branson has added a variation of the Virgin Galactic livery to his personal business jet, the Dassault Falcon 900EX ""Galactic Girl"" (G-GALX).[46][47] He was ninth in The Sunday Times Rich List 2006 of the wealthiest people or families in the UK, worth slightly more than £3 billion. Branson wrote in his autobiography of the decision to start an airline. My interest in life comes from setting myself huge, apparently unachievable challenges and trying to rise above them ... from the perspective of wanting to live life to the full, I felt that I had to attempt it. In 2006, the airline was merged with SN Brussels Airlines forming Brussels Airlines.[48] It also started a national airline based in Nigeria, called Virgin Nigeria, which ceased operations in 2009.[49] Another airline, Virgin America, began flying out of San Francisco International Airport in August 2007. Branson's next venture with the Virgin group was Virgin Fuels, which was set up to respond to global warming and exploit the recent spike in fuel costs by offering a revolutionary, cheaper fuel for automobiles and, in the near future, aircraft. Branson has stated that he was formerly a global warming sceptic and was influenced in his decision by a breakfast meeting with Al Gore.[50] On 21 September 2006, Branson pledged to invest the profits of Virgin Atlantic and Virgin Trains in research for environmentally-friendly fuels. The investment is estimated to be worth $3 billion.[51][52] On 4 July 2006, Branson sold his Virgin Mobile company to UK cable TV, broadband, and telephone company NTL:Telewest for £900million. A new company was launched with much fanfare and publicity on 8 February 2007, under the name Virgin Media. The decision to merge his Virgin Media Company with NTL was to integrate both companies' compatible parts of commerce. Branson used to own three-quarters of Virgin Mobile, whereas now he gets paid £8.5million each year for the use of the Virgin brand name. He does not own any part of Virgin Media.[53] In 2006, Branson formed Virgin Comics and Virgin Animation, an entertainment company focused on creating new stories and characters for a global audience. The company was founded with author Deepak Chopra, filmmaker Shekhar Kapur, and entrepreneurs Sharad Devarajan and Gotham Chopra.[54] Branson also launched the Virgin Health Bank on 1 February 2007, offering parents-to-be the opportunity to store their baby's umbilical cord blood stem cells in private and public stem-cell banks. In June 2006, a tip-off from Virgin Atlantic led both UK and US competition authorities to investigate price-fixing attempts between Virgin Atlantic and British Airways. In August 2007, British Airways was fined £271 million over the allegations. Virgin Atlantic was given immunity for tipping off the authorities and received no fine—a controversial decision the Office of Fair Trading defended as being in the public interest.[55] Branson with Alberto Hazan in June 2007 helping launch Virgin Radio Italia On 9 February 2007, Branson announced the setting up of a new global science and technology prize—The Virgin Earth Challenge—in the belief that history has shown that prizes of this nature encourage technological advancements for the good of mankind. The Virgin Earth Challenge was to award $25 million to the individual or group who are able to demonstrate a commercially viable design that will result in the net removal of anthropogenic, atmospheric greenhouse gases each year for at least ten years without countervailing harmful effects. This removal must have long-term effects and contribute materially to the stability of the Earth's climate. Branson also announced that he would be joined in the adjudication of the prize by a panel of five judges, all world authorities in their respective fields: Al Gore, Sir Crispin Tickell, Tim Flannery, James E. Hansen, and James Lovelock. In July 2007, Branson purchased his Australian home, Makepeace Island, in Noosa.[56] In August 2007, Branson announced that he bought a 20-percent stake in Malaysia's AirAsia X.[57] On 13 October 2007, Branson's Virgin Group sought to add Northern Rock to its empire after submitting an offer that would result in Branson personally owning 30% of the company and changing the company's name from Northern Rock to Virgin Money.[58] The Daily Mail ran a campaign against his bid; Vince Cable, financial spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats, suggested in the House of Commons that Branson's criminal conviction for tax evasion might be felt by some as a good enough reason not to trust him with public money.[59] 2008–2019: Hotels, healthcare and charitable influence[edit] On 10 January 2008, Virgin Healthcare announced that it would open a chain of health care clinics that would offer conventional medical care alongside homeopathic and complementary therapies, a development that was welcomed by Ben Bradshaw, the UK's health minister.[60] Plans where GPs could be paid for referring National Health Service (NHS) patients to private Virgin services were abandoned in June 2008. The BMA warned the plan would ""damage clinical objectivity"", there would be a financial incentive for GPs to push patients toward the Virgin services at the centre.[61] Plans to take over an NHS Practice in Swindon were abandoned in late September 2008.[62] Branson in April 2009 at the launch of Virgin America in Orange County, California In February 2009, Branson's Virgin organisation was reported as bidding to buy the former Honda Formula One team. Branson later stated an interest in Formula One, but claimed that, before the Virgin brand became involved with Honda or any other team, Formula One would have to develop a more economically efficient and environmentally responsible image. At the start of the 2009 Formula One season on 28 March, it was announced that Virgin would be sponsoring the new Brawn GP team,[63] with discussions also under way about introducing a less ""dirty"" fuel in the medium term.[64] After the end of the season and the subsequent purchase of Brawn GP by Mercedes-Benz, Branson invested in an 80% buyout of Manor Grand Prix,[65][66] with the team being renamed Virgin Racing. In 2010, Virgin Hotels was launched under the Virgin Group. In February 2018, Branson announced the first Virgin hotel in the UK would open in Edinburgh.[67] Branson and Tony Fernandes, owner of Air Asia and Lotus F1 Racing, had a bet for the 2010 F1 season where the losing team's boss should work on the winner's airline during a charity flight dressed as a stewardess. Fernandes escaped as the bet winner, as Lotus Racing ended tenth in the championship, while Virgin Racing ended twelfth and last. Branson kept his word after losing the bet, as he served his duty as a stewardess on an Air Asia flight between Perth and Kuala Lumpur on 12 May 2013.[68] Branson at the Time 100 Gala in May 2010. Known for his informal dress code,[69] this was a rare occasion he didn't wear an open shirt. In 2010, Branson became patron of the UK's Gordon Bennett 2010 gas balloon race, which has 16 hydrogen balloons flying across Europe.[70] In April 2012, Virgin Care commenced a five-year contract for provision of a range of health services which had previously been under the aegis of NHS Surrey, the local primary care trust.[71] By March 2015, Virgin Care was in charge of over 230 services nationwide.[72] In July 2012, Branson announced plans to build an orbital space launch system, designated LauncherOne.[73] Four commercial customers have already contracted for launches and two companies are developing standardised satellite buses optimised to the design of LauncherOne, in expectation of business opportunities created by the new smallsat launcher.[74] In August 2012, when re-tendered the InterCity West Coast franchise was awarded to FirstGroup after a competitive tender process overseen by the Department for Transport. Branson had expressed his concerns about the tender process and questioned the validity of the business plan submitted by FirstGroup. When Virgin Rail lost the contract, Branson said he was convinced the civil servants had ""got their maths wrong"". In October, after an investigation into the bidding process, the deal was scrapped. The Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin announced there were ""significant technical flaws"" in the process and mistakes had been made by transport staff. Virgin Rail continued to operate the West Coast line until 7 December 2019, when it was replaced by Avanti West Coast.[75] In September 2014, Branson announced his investment in drone company 3D Robotics stating, ""It's amazing to see what a little flying object with a GoPro attached can do. Before they came along the alternative was an expensive helicopter and crew. I'm really excited about the potential 3D Robotics sees in drones. They can do a lot of good in the world, and I hope this affordable technology will give many more people the chance to see our beautiful planet from such a powerful perspective.""[76] In 2014, Branson launched the ""Foodpreneur"" food and drink-focused start-up competition. Winners were provided with mentorship from Branson, legal support, and brand counseling.[77] The 2014 winners included Proper Beans, Killer Tomato, Sweetpea Pantry and Sweet Virtues. In 2015, the competition expanded to the Virgin StartUp's Foodpreneur Festival. The 2015 winners were given the opportunity to pitch Target Corporation buyers. The 2015 winners included Pip & Nut, Double Dutch Drinks, Harry Bromptons, Cauli Rice and Mallow and Marsh.[78] In March 2015, Virgin Trains East Coast commenced operating the InterCity East Coast franchise; the company was a joint venture between Stagecoach (90%) and Virgin Group (10%).[79][80] Due to the line performing below VTEC's expectations, it was announced in May 2018 that the contract would be terminated early by the government. VTEC ceased operating on 23 June 2018 and operations passed to a government-owned operator, London North Eastern Railway.[81] In November 2015, Branson announced the addition of Moskito Island to the Virgin Limited Edition portfolio. This resort, The Branson Estate on Moskito Island, offers 11 bedrooms for 22 guests.[82] Branson and Argentina's President Mauricio Macri, 22 January 2016 In 2017, Virgin Group invested in Hyperloop One, developing a strategic partnership between the two. Branson joined the board of directors,[83] and in December 2017, became its chairman.[84] The announced winner of the 2017 Virgin StartUp's Foodpreneur prize was The Snaffling Pig Co., which won a six-week rental space at Intu Lakeside, the retail center with the highest foot traffic in the United Kingdom.[85] In October 2017, Branson appeared on the Season 9 Premiere of Shark Tank as a guest investor,[86] where he invested in Locker Board,[87] a sustainable line of skateboards invented by 11-year-old, Carson Kropfl.[88] Branson told the young business man that he reminded him of himself.[89] Branson became the richest Shark to have appeared on the show.[90] In April 2018, Branson announced the acquisition of the Las Vegas based Hard Rock Casino-Hotel with plans to re-brand the property under his Virgin Hotels business.[91] Virgin Hotels Las Vegas opened on March 25, 2021. In May 2018, it was announced that he would become a partner in a private equity fund that will be co-managed by Metric Capital. The fund will seek out consumer goods firms to invest in.[92][93] In September 2018, Branson took part in his fourth Virgin Strive Challenge, where he and a core team travelled more than 2,000 km from Cagliari in Sardinia to the summit of Mont Blanc entirely under human and sail power. It was a gruelling month-long challenge where they hiked, biked and kayaked across Europe and had a near-miss on Mont Blanc when a rockfall rained down on them as they crossed the perilous Gouter Couloir. They raised more than £1m for Holly and Sam Branson's charity Big Change, which supports young people.[94] In February 2019, Branson helped organise an international benefit concert, Venezuela Aid Live, to bring worldwide attention to the humanitarian crisis and raise funds for humanitarian aid. The concert took place on 22 February in Cúcuta, Colombia, on the Venezuelan border. 2020–present: COVID-19 pandemic difficulties and further space ambitions[edit] Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo Unity in 2016 In March 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic which saw a dramatic decline in international air travel of around 60% globally,[95] Branson and Virgin attracted criticism by asking staff to take eight weeks' unpaid leave.[96] In response to the global pandemic, Branson put his luxury Necker Island up as collateral for a commercial loan to save Virgin Atlantic from going bust.[97] Branson said: ""Over the five decades I have been in business, this is the most challenging time we have ever faced... From a business perspective, the damage to many is unprecedented and the length of the disruption remains worryingly unknown.""[98] On 5 May 2020, it was announced that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the airline would lay off 3000 staff, reduce the fleet size to 35 by the summer of 2022, retire the Boeing 747-400s[99] and would not resume operations from Gatwick following the pandemic.[100] On 11 July 2021, Richard Branson took a flight with Beth Moses, Sirisha Bandla and Colin Bennett and reached edge of space (86 kilometers or 53 miles) on a Virgin Galatic spacecraft called VSS Unity. This made him the first billionaire founder of a space company to travel to the edge of space.[101] Failed business ventures[edit] Branson has been involved in a number of failed business ventures, such as Virgin Cola, Virgin Cars, Virgin Publishing, Virgin Clothing and Virgin Brides.[102][103] However, Branson holds an optimistic view of failure. He has written: ""I suppose the secret to bouncing back is not only to be unafraid of failures but to use them as motivational and learning tools... There's nothing wrong with making mistakes as long as you don't make the same ones over and over again.""[104] World record attempts[edit] The capsule from the Virgin Atlantic Flyer balloon on display at the Imperial War Museum, Duxford, England A 1998 attempt at an around-the-world balloon flight by Branson, Fossett, and Lindstrand ends in the Pacific Ocean on 25 December 1998. Branson made several world record-breaking attempts after 1985, when in the spirit of the Blue Riband he attempted the fastest Atlantic Ocean crossing by ship. His first attempt in the Virgin Atlantic Challenger led to the boat capsizing in British waters and a rescue by RAF helicopter, which received wide media coverage. Some newspapers called for Branson to reimburse the government for the rescue cost. In 1986, in his Virgin Atlantic Challenger II, he beat the record by two hours with sailing expert Daniel McCarthy.[105] A year later his hot air balloon Virgin Atlantic Flyer crossed the Atlantic.[106] In January 1991, Branson crossed the Pacific from Japan to Arctic Canada, 6,700 miles (10,800 km), in a balloon of 2,600,000 cubic feet (74,000 m3). This broke the record, with a speed of 145 miles per hour (233 km/h).[107] Between 1995 and 1998, Branson, Per Lindstrand, Vladimir Dzhanibekov, Larry Newman, and Steve Fossett made attempts to circumnavigate the globe by balloon. In late 1998, they made a record-breaking flight from Morocco to Hawaii but were unable to complete a global flight before Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones in Breitling Orbiter 3 in March 1999. In March 2004, Branson set a record by travelling from Dover to Calais in a Gibbs Aquada in 1 hour, 40 minutes and 6 seconds, the fastest crossing of the English Channel in an amphibious vehicle. The previous record of six hours was set by two Frenchmen.[108] The cast of Top Gear, Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond, attempted to break this record in an amphibious vehicle which they had constructed and, while successfully crossing the channel, did not break Branson's record. After being intercepted by the Coast Guard and asked what their intentions were, Clarkson remarked ""...our intentions are to go across the Channel faster than 'Beardy' Branson!"". The Coast Guard wished them 'Good luck and Bon Voyage'.[109] In September 2008, Branson and his children made an unsuccessful attempt at an eastbound record crossing of the Atlantic Ocean under sail in the 99-foot (30 m) sloop Virgin Money.[110] The boat, also known as Speedboat, is owned by NYYC member Alex Jackson, who was a co-skipper on this passage, with Branson and Mike Sanderson. After two days, four hours, winds of force 7 to 9 (strong gale), and seas of 40 feet (12 m), a 'monster wave' destroyed the spinnaker, washed a ten-man life raft overboard and severely ripped the mainsail. The sloop eventually continued to St. George's, Bermuda.[111] Television, film and print[edit] Branson at the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival Branson has guest starred, usually playing himself, on several television shows, including Friends, Baywatch, Birds of a Feather, Only Fools and Horses, The Day Today, a special episode of the comedy Goodness Gracious Me and Tripping Over. Branson made several appearances during the 1990s on the BBC Saturday morning show Live & Kicking, where he was referred to as 'the pickle man' by comedy act Trev and Simon (in reference to Branston Pickle).[112] Branson also appears in a cameo early in XTC's ""Generals and Majors"" video. He was also the star of a reality television show on Fox called The Rebel Billionaire: Branson's Quest for the Best (2004), in which sixteen contestants were tested for their entrepreneurship and sense of adventure and only lasted one season.[102] His high public profile often leaves him open as a figure of satire—the 2000 AD series Zenith features a parody of Branson as a super villain, as the comic's publisher and favoured distributor and the Virgin group were in competition at the time. He is also caricatured in The Simpsons episode ""Monty Can't Buy Me Love"" as the tycoon Arthur Fortune, as the ballooning megalomaniac Richard Chutney (a pun on Branson, as in Branston Pickle) in Believe Nothing, and voiced himself in ""The Princess Guide"". The character Grandson Richard 39 in Terry Pratchett's Wings is modelled on Branson. He has a cameo appearance in several films: Around the World in 80 Days (2004), where he played a hot-air balloon operator, and Superman Returns (2006), where he was credited as a 'Shuttle Engineer' and appeared alongside his son, Sam, with a Virgin Galactic-style commercial suborbital shuttle at the centre of his storyline. He also has a cameo in the James Bond film Casino Royale (2006). Here, he is seen as a passenger going through Miami Airport security check-in and being frisked – several Virgin Atlantic planes appear soon after. British Airways edited out Branson's cameo in their in-flight screening of the movie.[113] He makes a number of brief and disjointed appearances in the documentary Derek and Clive Get the Horn (1979), which follows the exploits of Peter Cook and Dudley Moore recording their final comedy album. Branson and his mother were also featured in the documentary film Lemonade Stories. On the TV series Rove Live in early 2006, Rove McManus and Sir Richard pushed each other into a swimming pool fully clothed live on TV during a ""Live at your house"" episode. Branson is a Star Trek fan and named his new spaceship VSS Enterprise in honour of the Star Trek spaceships, and in 2006, reportedly offered actor William Shatner a ride on the inaugural space launch of Virgin Galactic. In an interview in Time magazine, published on 10 August 2009, Shatner claimed that Branson approached him asking how much he would pay for a ride on the spaceship. In response, Shatner asked ""how much would you pay me to do it?"" In August 2007, Branson announced on The Colbert Report that he had named a new aircraft Air Colbert. He later doused political satirist and talk show host Stephen Colbert with water from his mug. Branson subsequently took a retaliatory splash from Colbert. The interview quickly ended, with both laughing[114] as shown on the episode aired on Comedy Central on 22 August 2007. The interview was promoted on The Report as the Colbert-Branson Interview Trainwreck. Branson then made a cameo appearance in The Soup, playing an intern working under Joel McHale who had been warned against getting into water fights with Stephen Colbert, and being subsequently fired. In March 2008, he launched Virgin Mobile in India; during that period, he made a cameo appearance in Bollywood film London Dreams.[115] In July 2010, Branson narrated Australian sailor Jessica Watson's documentary about her solo sailing trip around the world. In April 2011, Branson appeared on CNN's Mainsail with Kate Winslet.[116] Together they re-enacted a famous scene from the 1997 film Titanic for the cameras.[117][better source needed] On 17 August 2011, he was featured in the premier episode of Hulu's first long-form original production entitled, A Day in the Life.[118] At the 2012 Pride of Britain Awards on ITV on 30 October, Branson, along with Michael Caine, Elton John, Simon Cowell and Stephen Fry, recited Rudyard Kipling's poem ""If—"" in tribute to the 2012 British Olympic and Paralympics athletes.[119] In 1998, Branson released his autobiography, titled Losing My Virginity, an international best-seller.[120] Branson was deeply saddened by the disappearance of fellow adventurer Steve Fossett in September 2007; the following month he wrote an article for Time magazine, titled ""My Friend, Steve Fossett"".[121] Humanitarian initiatives[edit] In the late 1990s, Branson and musician Peter Gabriel discussed with Nelson Mandela their idea of a small group of leaders working to solve difficult global conflicts.[122] On 18 July 2007, in Johannesburg, South Africa, Mandela announced the formation of a new group, The Elders. Kofi Annan served as Chair of The Elders and Gro Harlem Brundtland as Deputy Chair. The Elders is funded by a group of donors, including Branson and Gabriel. Richard Branson with his mother Eve, and the board of directors of the International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children, April 2014 In 1999, Branson became a founding sponsor of the International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children (""ICMEC""), the goal of which is to help find missing children, and to stop the exploitation of children, as his mother Eve became a founding member of ICMEC's board of directors.[123][124] Through the Carbon War Room, founded in 2009, the entrepreneur sought solutions for global warming and the energy crisis. ""We all have a part to play, but I believe entrepreneurs will have a really significant role to play in bringing investment and commercial skills to help develop the new technologies needed to grow a post-carbon economy"", he said in his interview with Vision. Through Carbon War Room initiative he has focused efforts on finding sustainable alternatives for three industry sectors: shipping, energy efficiency and aviation and renewable jet fuels.[125] He also launched Virgin Startup, an official delivery partner for the UK's Start Up Loans programme. Through this new organisation, he provided loans to entrepreneurs between the ages of 18 and 30 UK-wide. A pilot of the scheme, which ran over 11 months, injected £600,000 into 100 businesses.[125] Branson's other work in South Africa includes the Branson School of Entrepreneurship, set up in 2005 as a partnership between Virgin Unite, the non-profit foundation of Virgin, and entrepreneur Taddy Blecher, the founder of CIDA City Campus, a university in Johannesburg. The school aims to improve economic growth in South Africa by supporting start-ups and micro-enterprises with skills, mentors, services, networks and finance arrangements.[126][127] Fundraising activity to support the school is achieved by The Sunday Times Fast Track 100, sponsored by Virgin Group, at its yearly event, where places to join Richard Branson on trips to South Africa to provide coaching and mentoring to students are auctioned to attendees. In 2009, Jason Luckhurst and Boyd Kershaw of Practicus, Martin Ainscough of the Ainscough Group and Matthew Riley of Daisy Communications helped raise £150,000 through the auction.[128] In March 2008, Branson hosted an environmental gathering at his private island, Necker Island, in the Caribbean with several prominent entrepreneurs, celebrities, and world leaders. They discussed global warming-related problems facing the world, hoping that the meeting would be a precursor to future discussions regarding similar problems. Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales, and Larry Page of Google were in attendance.[129] On 8 May 2009, Branson took over Mia Farrow's hunger strike for three days in protest of the Sudanese government expulsion of aid groups from the Darfur region.[130] In 2010, he and the Nduna Foundation (founded by Amy Robbins), and Humanity United (an organization backed by Pam Omidyar, the wife of eBay founder Pierre Omidyar) founded Enterprise Zimbabwe.[131] Branson at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in 2012 Branson is a signatory of Global Zero campaign, a non-profit international initiative for the elimination of all nuclear weapons worldwide.[132] Since its launch in Paris in December 2008,[133] Global Zero has grown to 300 leaders, including current and former heads of state, national security officials and military commanders, and 400,000 citizens worldwide; developed a practical step-by-step plan to eliminate nuclear weapons; launched an international student campaign with 75 campus chapters in eight countries; and produced a documentary film, Countdown to Zero, in partnership with Lawrence Bender and Participant Media.[134] Since 2010, Branson has served as a Commissioner on the Broadband Commission for Digital Development, a UN initiative which promotes universal access to broadband services.[135] In 2011, Branson served on the Global Commission on Drug Policy with former political and cultural leaders of Latin America and elsewhere, ""in a bid to boost the effort to achieve more humane and rational drug laws.""[136] In December 2013, Branson urged companies to boycott Uganda because of its ""anti-homosexuality bill"". Branson stated that it would be ""against my conscience to support this country...governments must realize that people should be able to love whoever they want.""[137] In 2014, Branson joined forces with African Wildlife Foundation and partner WildAid for the ""Say No"" Campaign, an initiative to bring public awareness to the issues of wildlife poaching and trafficking.[138] Branson is an opponent of the death penalty, stating: ""the death penalty is always cruel, barbaric and inhumane. It has no place in the world.""[139] The US is one of the few countries that practises the death penalty, and on 30 September 2015, Branson released a letter in support of American inmate Richard Glossip on the day he was due to be executed, buying an ad in The Oklahoman newspaper which had advocated the execution.[140] Branson stated the evidence against Glossip was flawed and that ""every person is deserving of a fair trial"", adding: ""Your state is about to execute a man whose guilt has not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.""[140] In October 2018, Branson spoke out for Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist allegedly killed by Saudi authorities in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey by suspending his advisory role from Saudi Arabia's biggest Red Sea tourism project. He issued a statement saying, ""The disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, if proved true, would clearly change the ability of any of us in the West to do business with the Saudi Government.""[141] On 1 December 2020 Virgin Orbit launched The Patti Grace Smith Fellowship, designed to offer paid work experience and mentorship in the aerospace industry for 'extraordinary Black students.'[142] Climate change pledge[edit] Branson discusses climate change with the United States Secretary of State John Kerry in 2016 In 2006, Branson made a high-profile pledge to invest $3 billion toward addressing global warming over the course of the following decade.[143][144] However, author and activist Naomi Klein has criticised Branson for contributing ""well under $300 million"" as of 2014, far below the originally stated goal.[145] Additionally, Klein says Virgin airlines' greenhouse gas emissions increased considerably in the years following his pledge.[146] Politics[edit] In the 1980s, Branson was briefly given the post of ""litter Tsar"" by Margaret Thatcher—charged with ""keeping Britain tidy"".[147][148] During the BBC Coverage of the 1997 UK General Election, Branson was interviewed at the Labour party celebrations at the Royal Festival Hall.[149] In 2005, he declared that there were only negligible differences between the two main parties on economic matters.[150] He was suggested as a candidate for Mayor of London before the first 2000 election, with polls indicating he would be a viable candidate, but he did not express interest.[151][152][153] In March 2015, Branson said that almost all drug use should be decriminalised in the UK, following the example of Portugal.[154] Branson has supported continuing British membership of the European Union and was opposed to the 2016 referendum.[155] On 28 June 2016, interviewed for ITV's Good Morning Britain, he said that his company had lost a third of its value as a result of the referendum result and that a planned venture, employing over 3,000 people, which he had announced before the referendum, had been shelved. He gave his backing for a second referendum.[156] Branson endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the run-up for the 2016 US presidential election.[157] Honours and awards[edit] Waxwork of Branson at Madame Tussauds, London In 1992, Branson received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.[158] In 1993, Branson was awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Technology from Loughborough University.[159] In the New Years Honours list dated 30 December 1999, Elizabeth II signified her intention to confer the honour of Knight Bachelor on him for his ""services to entrepreneurship"".[160][161] He was knighted by Charles, Prince of Wales on 30 March 2000 at an investiture in Buckingham Palace.[162] Also in 2000, Branson received the Tony Jannus Award for his accomplishments in commercial air transportation. In 2000, Branson was inducted into the International Air & Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air & Space Museum.[163] Branson appears at No. 85 on the 2002 list of 100 Greatest Britons on the BBC and voted for by the public. Branson was also ranked in 2007's Time magazine's list of the 100 Most Influential People in The World.[164] On 7 December 2007, United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon presented Branson with the United Nations Correspondents Association Citizen of the World Award for his support for environmental and humanitarian causes.[165] On 24 January 2011, Branson was awarded the German Media Prize (organised by ""Media Control Charts""), previously handed to former US president Bill Clinton and the Dalai Lama. On 14 November 2011, Branson was awarded the ISTA Prize by the International Space Transport Association in The Hague for his pioneering achievements in the development of suborbital transport systems with ""Virgin Galactic"".[166] On 11 February 2012, Branson was honoured with the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences' President's Merit Award for his contributions to the music industry.[167] On 2 June 2013, Branson received an honorary degree of Doctor Honoris Causa from Kaunas Technology University in Kaunas, Lithuania.[168] On 15 May 2014, Branson received the 2014 Business for Peace Award, awarded annually by the Business for Peace Foundation in Oslo, Norway.[169] On 21 September 2014, Branson was recognized by The Sunday Times as the most admired business person over the last five decades.[170] On 9 October 2014, Branson was named as the No. 1 LGBT ally by the OUTstanding organisation.[171] On 29 October 2015, Branson was listed by UK-based company Richtopia at number 1 in the list of 100 Most Influential British Entrepreneurs.[172] In October 2015, Branson received the International Crisis Group Chairman's Award at the United Nations Development Programme's in Pursuit of Peace Awards Dinner.[173] Controversies[edit] Tax evasion[edit] In 1971, Branson was convicted and briefly jailed for tax evasion, having fraudulently obtained export documents for records to be sold on the domestic market to avoid paying Purchase Tax.[174][175] Customs officials caught onto the scheme and executed a sting operation, marking records bought for the international market with invisible ink and subsequently buying them on the domestic market. Branson was advised of the sting by an anonymous tip-off and attempted to dispose of the evidence, but this was unsuccessful.[174][175] Branson's business empire is owned by a complicated series of offshore trusts and companies. The Sunday Times stated that his wealth is calculated at £3 billion; if he were to retire to his Caribbean island and liquidate all of this, he would pay relatively little in tax.[176] Branson has been criticised for his business strategy, and has been accused of being a carpetbagger.[177][178][179] Branson responded that he is living on Necker for health rather than tax reasons.[180] In 2013, Branson described himself as a ""tax exile"", having saved millions in tax by ending his mainland British residency and living in the British Virgin Islands.[181] This was echoed by Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, Labour's John McDonnell, in 2016, amid calls for his knighthood to be revoked.[182] Promotion of SeaWorld[edit] Branson has been criticised by the Whale and Dolphin Conservation organisation for profiting from selling trips to SeaWorld and similar themed parks that hold dolphins, whales and other sea life in captivity for entertainment purposes.[183][184] Assault claim[edit] In November 2017, singer Antonia Jenae, a backing singer for Joss Stone, claimed Branson sexually assaulted her at Necker Island by ""putting his head between her cleavage and making boat engine noises"", a practice that, when performed consensually, is known as motorboating.[185] A spokesperson for Branson confirmed to The Sun newspaper that members of the band had been invited for a party on the island in 2010, but that he and friends and family in attendance had ""no recollection"" of the events and that ""there would never have been any intention to offend or make anyone feel uncomfortable. Richard apologises if anyone felt that way.""[185][186] Personal life[edit] Branson married Kristen Tomassi in 1972 and divorced her in 1979. He has a daughter Holly (b. 1981) and a son Sam (b. 1985) with his second wife, Joan Templeman, whom he met in 1976. They were married in 1989 on Necker Island.[187] He stated in an interview with Piers Morgan that he and Joan also had a daughter named Clare Sarah, who died when she was four days old in 1979.[188][189] In 2007 Branson was ordained as a minister by the Universal Life Church Monastery to conduct an on-flight wedding as part of a marketing effort for domestic flights in the USA on Virgin America airline.[190] From 2013 to 2017 Branson served as President of the Old Stoic Society of Stowe School.[191][192] Branson is also an experienced kitesurfer, holding some world records in the sport.[193][194] In August 2016 Branson was injured while riding his bicycle in the British Virgin Islands and suffered torn ligaments and a cracked cheek as a result. He was taken to hospital in Miami for X-rays and scans.[195] In 2017 Branson's Necker Island home was left uninhabitable after Hurricane Irma.[196] It was the second time the Necker Island home had been severely damaged after the building caught fire when it was struck by lightning caused by Hurricane Irene in 2011.[197] Branson's mother Eve died from COVID-19 complications in January 2021 at the age of 96. A celebration of her life was posted online by her son.[198] Influences[edit] Branson has stated in a number of interviews that he has been much influenced by non-fiction books. He most commonly mentions Nelson Mandela's autobiography, Long Walk to Freedom, explaining that Mandela was ""one of the most inspiring men I have ever met and had the honour to call my friend."" Owing to his interest in humanitarian and ecological issues, Branson also lists Al Gore's best-selling book, An Inconvenient Truth, and The Revenge of Gaia by James Lovelock amongst his favourites. According to Branson's book, Screw It, Let's Do It: Lessons in Life, he is also a fan of Jung Chang's Wild Swans and Antony Beevor's Stalingrad.[199][200] In fiction, Branson has long admired the character Peter Pan,[201] and in 2006, he founded Virgin Comics LLC, stating that Virgin Comics will give ""a whole generation of young, creative thinkers a voice"".[202][203] Bibliography[edit] Branson, Richard (1998).

It advocates for business practices that are more centered on humanity and the climate.[2] Contents 1 History 1.1 Leaders 2 Work and Collective Action 3 References History[edit] In 2013, a group of leaders came together following a series of workshops were held that included civil society leaders, systems experts, sustainability pioneers, economists and entrepreneurs. Inspired by the work of Lester Brown and the B Corporation movement, they labeled their vision for a better way of doing business 'Plan B,' and 'The B Team' emerged. The B Team intends to achieve this vision by starting at home, working to advance Challenges in their own companies that get right to the heart of the issues that cause companies to remain rooted in 'Plan A' - business as usual, and to empower business leaders around the world to join them.[3][4][5] The B Team was incubated by Virgin Unite, the charitable arm of the Virgin Group,[3] which had previously incubated such organizations the Elders and the Carbon War Room. In October 2012, Branson and Zeitz announced the formation of The B Team. Its first CEO was Derek Handley, co-founder of The Hyperfactory.[6] It has since grown to include 28 leaders. Leaders[edit] The founding B Team leaders include: Sir Richard Branson, Founder of the Virgin Group and Co-Founder and Co-Chair of the B Team, Kathy Calvin, President and CEO of the United Nations Foundation, Dr. Gro Harlem Brundtland, Deputy Chair of The Elders, Christiana Figueres, Convener of Mission 2020, Mats Granryd, Director General of GSMA, Arianna Huffington, Founder and CEO of Thrive Global, Mo Ibrahim, Founder of Celtel, Guilherme Leal, Founder and Co-Chairman of Natura, Strive Masiyiwa, Founder and Chairman of Econet Wireless, Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Coordinating Minister of the Economy and Minister of Finance of Nigeria, François-Henri Pinault, CEO and Chairman of Kering, Paul Polman, CEO of Unilever, Mary Robinson, Secretary of The Elders and President of the Mary Robinson Foundation for Climate Justice, Ratan Tata, Chairman Emeritus of the Tata Group, Zhang Yue, Chairman and Founder of Broad Group China, Professor Muhammad Yunus, Chairman of Yunus Centre, Jochen Zeitz, Founder of The Zeitz Foundation, Co-Founder and Co-Chair of The B Team.[7] In 2015, Marc Benioff, Founder, Chairman and CEO of Salesforce.com, Sharan Burrow, General Sectretary of the International Trade Union Confederation, Bob Collymore, CEO of Safaricom[8] and David Crane, ex-CEO of NRG[9] joined as B Team Leaders. In July, 2016 Oliver Bäte, CEO of Allianz Group, Andrew Liveris, Chairman and CEO of Dow Chemical Company and Arif Naqvi, Founder and Group CEO of Abraaj Group also joined the team.[10] Work and Collective Action[edit] In 2015 The B Team leaders advocated for a climate agreement at the COP21 meeting. They supported a long-term goal to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees, to preserve oceans and save low-lying island nations from rising sea levels.[11] Ten companies associated with The B Team set aspirations for their own organisations to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, including the French apparel and accessories group Kering; the US electricity company NRG Energy; the Kenyan mobile network operator Safaricom; the global enterprise cloud computing company Salesforce.com; the internationally renowned jeweler Tiffany & Co; the Chinese construction company BROAD Group, the African telecommunications group Econet, the Brazilian cosmetics manufacturer Natura, the consumer goods company Unilever, and the international investment group Virgin Management.[12] The B Team leaders called on governments around the world to adopt Net-Zero by 2050 as a long-term goal in the COP21 agreement.[13] The B Team worked as part of the We Mean Business Coalition, alongside partners like Ceres and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, to drive bold climate action by business in 2015.[14] In 2014 The B Team, along with Unilever, Natura, Transparency International, Global Witness, Global Financial Integrity and OpenCorporates formed a working group to support and increase the number of companies implementing beneficial ownership transparency and worked to articulate a business case for doing so.[15] B Team leader's advocated to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative board in favour of adopting a beneficial ownership transparency standard for its 51 members, which they did in March 2016.[16] Following the release of the Panama Papers in April 2016 The B Team announced, along with its partners Global Witness, ONE, Open Contracting Partnership, OpenCorporates, The Web Foundation, and Transparency International, the creation of a Global Beneficial Ownership Register for businesses to share their company structures, and eliminate the use of shell companies like those used to obfuscate the owners of assets in the Panama Papers.[17] In 2015 The B Team launched the 100% Human at Work initiative and network as they believed it was ""time for businesses to stop looking at people as resources and to start seeing them as human beings"".[18] The B Team have built the People Innovation Network, to bring companies together to share and learn from one another about how to help their employees thrive at work.[19] Working as part of the Natural Capital Coalition The B Team supported the development of the first global, standard Natural Capital Protocol - a set of tools for companies to measure their impacts and dependencies on nature. The protocol was launched July 2016, following pilots by more than 40 companies, including Kering and Dow Chemical.[20] Kering Group also published its pioneering group-wide environmental profit and loss accounts in 2015.[21] In 2016, as part of their work for The B Team Sir Richard Branson and Marc Benioff launched a movement of entrepreneurs and business leaders building their companies with people and planet alongside profit as part of their DNA from the outset, called ""Born B'"".[22] In 2017 The B Team launched The B Team Africa, its first regional B Team. Its initial leadership included Bob Collymore, Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Dr. Mo Ibrahim, and Jochen Zeitz.[23] Subsequently, it added The B Team Australia Network as a regional team.[24] In 2018, The B Team partnered with Ceres to launch 'Getting Climate Smart - A Primer for Corporate Directors in a Changing Environment'. The project sought to make corporate directors aware that climate change is a board-relevant issue and teach them how to manage the risks and opportunities related to climate. Sponsoring the project was the Ikea Foundation and the We Mean Business Coalition.[25] References[edit] ^ Huffington, Arianna (12 June 2013). ""People, Planet, Profit: Introducing The Be Team"".

The Carbon Trust Triple Standard help organisations communicate their leadership in resource management but also, through our expert advice, receive assistance on how to maintain continuous reduction. The Carbon Trust Standard for Carbon, The Carbon Trust Standard for Water and The Carbon Trust Standard for Waste can also be pursued individually. Case study - Certifying reductions in Iskur Denim’s water use The Carbon Trust Standard for Supply Chain The world’s first independent certification for organisations that are measuring, managing and reducing greenhouse gas (CO2e) emissions in their supply chains. Understanding supply chain emissions and engaging suppliers to drive decarbonisation across the value chain is a key step on the journey to net zero. This Standard is an enabler for supply chain emissions assessment, supplier engagement and a demonstration of dedication to reducing upstream emissions. The Carbon Trust Standard for Zero Waste to Landfill Circular economy is a key instrument to achieving net zero, and this certification recognises organisations taking a best practice approach to waste management, actively diverting all appropriate waste streams from landfill. This Standard also provides advice on waste arisings reduction, therefore enabling ongoing progress. Case study - Zero Waste to Landfill in Costa Rica We chose to work with the Carbon Trust because of its world-leading experience in footprinting, giving us confidence in the credible communication of the water impacts of our denim manufacturing operations. We also now have an accurate baseline, which we can use to measure the progress of our strategy to reduce water use going forward. Özlem Özkan Head of Research & Product Development, Iskur Denim We sought the Zero Waste to Landfill certification because we wanted to provide traceability, trust, credibility and accountability in the organisation’s waste management, internally and externally, through an international organisation.

An economy fit for the planet (pdf) Image I lead the Green Finance team, and it’s exciting to work with a wide range of financial institutions to help them figure out how they can be part of the solution to climate change-related challenges. I work with incredibly motivated and talented colleagues who really care about our mission and are always ready to roll up their sleeves to help; it’s the people here at the Carbon Trust that make it special. Gina V Hall Investment Director and Global Head of Sustainable Finance, The Carbon Trust Image I’m really excited to be leading the growth of our African work from our South African office, where, since 2015 we’ve been increasingly working throughout the continent, working on issues of resource efficiency and sustainability. Particularly fascinating is our work on energy access – it’s here that our experience in sustainability and renewable technology can have meaningful impacts not only on climate change, but also on international development. Benjamin Curnier Director, The Carbon Trust Image Carbon Trust provides a lot of things I value in an organisation - interesting and challenging work, friendly environment and freedom to innovate. Underlying all of this is the important mission on decarbonisation that everyone at the Carbon Trust strives towards, this makes the work quite fulfilling.
