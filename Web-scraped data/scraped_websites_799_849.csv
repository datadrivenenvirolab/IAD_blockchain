The Alliance works with, and for people at the frontline of climate crisis in rural settings, believes that environmental and climate justice will be achieved only if governments recognize the right to justice and respond with policies, resources, and actions to meet the needs and aspirations of their citizens and ensure inclusion of vulnerable groups such as women, indigenous peoples, youth, people living with disabilities in all aspects of decision-making processes especially in climate financing and in climate information and services (CIS). PACJA's Programme mirrors three thematic areas, namely Resilient People Societies and Economies (ReSPE), Just Transition and Energy Access (JTEA), and Climate Finance (CF), which informs its interventions, and particularly the implementation of the Nationally Determined Contributions of the Paris Agreement and overall acceleration of climate action. In collaboration with four other partners, PACJA has received a five-year Grant from the Dutch Government under the Power of voices partnership program, whose implementation kicks-off this year. The Grant will support the African Activists for Climate Justice (AACJ) Consortium, which brings together PACJA , Oxfam Novib, Natural Justice, African Women Communications Network (FEMNET) and African Youth Commission (AYC). The AACJ Consortium believes that it is hugely unjust that people who have contributed least to the changing climate are most affected by its impacts. The Consortium’s collective conviction is that the causes and effects of climate change, and the solutions thereto, must be consistent much more strongly to concepts of justice, in particular, environmental justice and social justice. The Consortium seeks to galvanise the voices of communities at the frontline of climate crisis to ensure their desires, people-centred solutions and fundamental rights are met besides engaging governments, private sector and non-state actors, most of whom find it difficult to balance between the needs of current and future generations and the health of the planet. The AACJ will therefore fortify and contribute to the strengthening of African movement for climate justice while amplifying the voices of Africans in the global conversations around climate action. The Consortium will work with women, youth and indigenous and local communities – as well as other traditionally side-lined groups, such as people with disabilities - to strengthen movements, develop African narratives, strengthen human rights frameworks and build communities’ adaptive-resilience capacities. It will work to increase the political will for change; to call on governments and the private sector to boldly act on the climate crisis while upholding the rights of all people to live a decent and dignified life in a healthy environment. For the effective implementation of the Project, the Consortium seeks to recruit suitably qualified persons whose details can be downloaded from the following links: Display # 5 10 15 20 25 30 50 100 All PROJECT AND CONTRACT MANAGER [Closed] 19 May 2021 Hits: 1502 COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER [Closed] 19 May 2021 Hits: 1873 ADVOCACY OFFICER [Closed] 19 May 2021 Hits: 1304 PROJECT SUPPORT OFFICER [Closed] 19 May 2021 Hits: 3065 MONITORING, EVALUATION, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND LEARNING (MEAL) COORDINATOR [Closed] 19 May 2021 Hits: 1502 SENIOR FINANCE OFFICER [Closed] 19 May 2021 Hits: 2366 CLIMATE JUSTICE & RESILIENCE FACILITY FOR AFRICA (CJRFA) COORDINATOR [Closed] 19 May 2021 Hits: 1071 COMMUNICATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT MANAGER [Closed] 19 May 2021 Hits: 1337 Copyright © 2020 Panafrican Climate Justice Alliance(PACJA).

Corp. aims to focus on environmental justice by holding consumers and corporates responsible for their actions. Many countries within Africa do not have its own industrial chain to deal with waste, especially wastes from all over the world. We hope to establish a waste-to-resource industrial chain.”— PANELTECH.US CEO, Leiven TsaiPASADENA , CALIFORNIA, UNITED STATES, June 15, 2021 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Amidst global pandemic turbulences, we are harshly reminded of imbedded inequality when it comes to addressing the negative impact of man-made disasters. Today, we have essential healthcare accessible only for higher income countries, leaving dire places to worsen. Similar to COVID-19, the climate crisis disproportionately affects people in poverty, taking lives at unnatural rates. Unprecedented challenges concerning the environment continues to lead us to disastrous tipping points. Among many things we take for granted in our environment, one key problem is the unsustainable usage of natural resources and imbedded wastefulness stemming from our daily habits as consumers. Climate change not only threatens our ecology and fauna, but sheds light onto the apparent injustice within out supply and demand. A waste-solutions provider- PANELTECH US. Corp. aims to refocus on the notion of environmental justice by holding consumers and corporates responsible for their actions. The company acts to fulfill UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and set a new normal for all stakeholders involved in the management of waste. To bring further insights and innovation, PANELTECH US. Corp. is excited to partner up with Pan African Climate Justice Alliance (PACJA), to jointly foster its circular economic model in the African continent. Established by a group of civil societies to raise local voices in the international dialogue of climate change, PACJA’s mandate is to unify grassroots efforts in addressing systemic problems. Today, PACJA holds alliance with more than 1000 organizations spanning 48 African countries. These include NGOs, CBOs, indigenous communities, trusts, foundations and local farmers. “Nowadays most of us are living comfortably, we have zoom meetings in an air-conditioned room, talking about that we need to help the most vulnerable. But to visit the farmers and work with them is the way to truly understand what kind of hardship they are suffering. That is why we have to advocate for climate justice alliance,” says Mr. Mithika Mwenda from PACJA. PACJA’s vision is to empower and amplify the voices of rural communities, women, disabled people and many more who urgently need sustainable aid. These activities are supported and funded by Swedish International Development Corporation Agency (SIDA) and the World Bank, as well as several governments across the African continent. PACJA will push for further research on these communities through its national platforms including the implementation of a 10 years’ sub-grant project funded by the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) to address deforestation. Furthermore, PACJA has forged strong partnerships with key stakeholders such as the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN), United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP), regional economic integration communities and national governments to enhance the continent’s voice in international platforms to drive climate-related policies in Africa. Through partnership with PACJA, PANELTECH US. Corp. can gain on-the-ground understanding of local problems, thus to better assist in mobilizing existing strengths of local network and build resilience to climate change impacts in Africa. “Majority of the countries within Africa does not have its own industrial chain to deal with waste, nor the ability to deal with wastes from all over the world. We hope to establish an industrial chain from waste-to-resource solutions, produce essential materials such as construction materials needed locally, with potential to be exported globally, essentially addressing structural problems and create job opportunities in the waste management sector,” says Leiven Tsai, CEO of PANELTECH.US Corp. Together, they will move forward the AGENDA 2063 of the African Union (AU) and United Nation’s SDGs. PANELTECH.US and PACJA will combine their resources to mobilize the sustainable development plan for a green circular economy, hence carry out effective change at a greater scale. Concurrently, PACJA will have the observer status for PANELTECH.US’ projects and green profit funds, advise PANELTECH.US on where and how the utility of green profits can be maximized. Justice needs to be at the forefront of development projects today and both entities hope to hold corporates and governments accountable for their actions. Under the existing strengths of PACJA, it is with optimism to foresee positive changes come out from the collaboration. If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. - African proverbTiffany Jan PANELTECH.US Corp. +1 626-363-3123 email us here Visit us on social media: Facebook Twitter LinkedIn You just read: Waste-solutions Company Partners with Pan African Climate Justice Alliance to Emphasize Environmental Justice News Provided By PANELTECH.US Corp.

Paris (French pronunciation: ​[paʁi] (listen)) is the capital and most populous city of France, with an estimated population of 2,175,601 residents as of 2018[update], in an area of more than 105 square kilometres (41 square miles).[4] Since the 17th century, Paris has been one of Europe's major centres of finance, diplomacy, commerce, fashion, gastronomy, science, and arts. The City of Paris is the centre and seat of government of the region and province of Île-de-France, or Paris Region, which has an estimated population of 12,174,880, or about 18 percent of the population of France as of 2017[update].[5] The Paris Region had a GDP of €709 billion ($808 billion) in 2017.[6] According to the Economist Intelligence Unit Worldwide Cost of Living Survey in 2018, Paris was the second most expensive city in the world, after Singapore and ahead of Zürich, Hong Kong, Oslo, and Geneva.[7] Another source ranked Paris as most expensive, on a par with Singapore and Hong Kong, in 2018.[8][9] Paris is a major railway, highway, and air-transport hub served by two international airports: Paris–Charles de Gaulle (the second-busiest airport in Europe) and Paris–Orly.[10][11] Opened in 1900, the city's subway system, the Paris Métro, serves 5.23 million passengers daily;[12] it is the second busiest metro system in Europe after the Moscow Metro. Gare du Nord is the 24th-busiest railway station in the world, but the first located outside Japan, with 262 million passengers in 2015.[13] Paris is especially known for its museums and architectural landmarks: the Louvre was the most visited art museum in the world in 2019, with 9.6 million visitors,[14][15] and remained the most-visited art museum in 2020 when the number of visitors dropped to 2.7 million due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[16] The Musée d'Orsay, Musée Marmottan Monet and Musée de l'Orangerie are noted for their collections of French Impressionist art. The Pompidou Centre Musée National d'Art Moderne has the largest collection of modern and contemporary art in Europe. The Musée Rodin and Musée Picasso exhibit the works of two noted Parisians. The historical district along the Seine in the city centre is classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site; popular landmarks there include the Cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris on the Île de la Cité, now closed for renovation after the 15 April 2019 fire. Other popular tourist sites include the Gothic royal chapel of Sainte-Chapelle, also on the Île de la Cité; the Eiffel Tower, constructed for the Paris Universal Exposition of 1889; the Grand Palais and Petit Palais, built for the Paris Universal Exposition of 1900; the Arc de Triomphe on the Champs-Élysées, and the hill of Montmartre with its artistic history and its Basilica of Sacré-Coeur. Paris received 38 million visitors in 2019, measured by hotel stays, with the largest numbers of foreign visitors coming from the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and China.[17] It was ranked as the second-most-visited travel destination in the world in 2019, after Bangkok and just ahead of London.[18] Due to the city's international recognition, a number of places around the world, such as Bucharest and Leipzig, have been nicknamed Little Paris. The football club Paris Saint-Germain and the rugby union club Stade Français are based in Paris. The 80,000-seat Stade de France, built for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, is located just north of Paris in the neighbouring commune of Saint-Denis. Paris hosts the annual French Open Grand Slam tennis tournament on the red clay of Roland Garros. The city hosted the Olympic Games in 1900, 1924 and will host the 2024 Summer Olympics. The 1938 and 1998 FIFA World Cups, the 2007 Rugby World Cup, as well as the 1960, 1984 and 2016 UEFA European Championships were also held in the city. Every July, the Tour de France bicycle race finishes on the Avenue des Champs-Élysées in Paris.

The ancient oppidum that corresponds to the modern city of Paris was first mentioned in the mid-1st century BC by Julius Caesar as Luteciam Parisiorum ('Lutetia of the Parisii'), and is later attested as Parision in the 5th century AD, then as Paris in 1265.[19][20] During the Roman period, it was commonly known as Lutetia or Lutecia in Latin, and as Leukotekía in Greek, which is interpreted as either stemming from the Celtic root *lukot- ('mouse'), or from *luto- ('marsh, swamp'), depending on whether the Latin or Greek form is the closest to the original Celtic name.[21][22][20] The name Paris is derived from its early inhabitants, the Parisii, a Gallic tribe from the Iron Age and the Roman period.[23] The meaning of the Gaulish ethnonym remains debated. According to Xavier Delamarre, it may derive from the Celtic root pario- ('cauldron').[23] Alfred Holder interpreted the name as 'the makers' or 'the commanders', by comparing it to the Welsh peryff ('lord, commander'), both possibly descending from a Proto-Celtic form reconstructed as *kwar-is-io-.[24] Alternatively, Pierre-Yves Lambert proposed to translate Parisii as the 'spear people', by connecting the first element to the Old Irish carr ('spear'), derived from an earlier *kwar-sā.[20] In any case, the city's name is not related to the Paris of Greek mythology. Paris is often referred to as the 'City of Light' (La Ville Lumière),[25] both because of its leading role during the Age of Enlightenment and more literally because Paris was one of the first large European cities to use gas street lighting on a grand scale on its boulevards and monuments. Gas lights were installed on the Place du Carrousel, Rue de Rivoli and Place Vendome in 1829. By 1857, the Grand boulevards were lit.[26] By the 1860s, the boulevards and streets of Paris were illuminated by 56,000 gas lamps.[27] Since the late 19th century, Paris has also been known as Panam(e) (pronounced [panam]) in French slang.[28] Inhabitants are known in English as ""Parisians"" and in French as Parisiens ([paʁizjɛ̃] (listen)). They are also pejoratively called Parigots ([paʁiɡo] (listen)).[note 1][29] History[edit] Main articles: History of Paris and Timeline of Paris Origins[edit] Main article: Lutetia The Parisii, a sub-tribe of the Celtic Senones, inhabited the Paris area from around the middle of the 3rd century BC.[30][31] One of the area's major north–south trade routes crossed the Seine on the île de la Cité; this meeting place of land and water trade routes gradually became an important trading centre.[32] The Parisii traded with many river towns (some as far away as the Iberian Peninsula) and minted their own coins for that purpose.[33] Gold coins minted by the Parisii (1st century BC) The Romans conquered the Paris Basin in 52 BC and began their settlement on Paris' Left Bank.[34] The Roman town was originally called Lutetia (more fully, Lutetia Parisiorum, ""Lutetia of the Parisii"", modern French Lutèce). It became a prosperous city with a forum, baths, temples, theatres, and an amphitheatre.[35] By the end of the Western Roman Empire, the town was known as Parisius, a Latin name that would later become Paris in French.[36] Christianity was introduced in the middle of the 3rd century AD by Saint Denis, the first Bishop of Paris: according to legend, when he refused to renounce his faith before the Roman occupiers, he was beheaded on the hill which became known as Mons Martyrum (Latin ""Hill of Martyrs""), later ""Montmartre"", from where he walked headless to the north of the city; the place where he fell and was buried became an important religious shrine, the Basilica of Saint-Denis, and many French kings are buried there.[37] Clovis the Frank, the first king of the Merovingian dynasty, made the city his capital from 508.[38] As the Frankish domination of Gaul began, there was a gradual immigration by the Franks to Paris and the Parisian Francien dialects were born. Fortification of the Île de la Cité failed to avert sacking by Vikings in 845, but Paris' strategic importance—with its bridges preventing ships from passing—was established by successful defence in the Siege of Paris (885–886), for which the then Count of Paris (comte de Paris), Odo of France, was elected king of West Francia.[39] From the Capetian dynasty that began with the 987 election of Hugh Capet, Count of Paris and Duke of the Franks (duc des Francs), as king of a unified Francia, Paris gradually became the largest and most prosperous city in France.[37] High and Late Middle Ages to Louis XIV[edit] See also: Paris in the Middle Ages, Paris in the 16th century, and Paris in the 17th century The Palais de la Cité and Sainte-Chapelle, viewed from the Left Bank, from the Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry (month of June) (1410) By the end of the 12th century, Paris had become the political, economic, religious, and cultural capital of France.[40] The Palais de la Cité, the royal residence, was located at the western end of the Île de la Cité. In 1163, during the reign of Louis VII, Maurice de Sully, bishop of Paris, undertook the construction of the Notre Dame Cathedral at its eastern extremity. After the marshland between the river Seine and its slower 'dead arm' to its north was filled in around the 10th century,[41] Paris' cultural centre began to move to the Right Bank. In 1137, a new city marketplace (today's Les Halles) replaced the two smaller ones on the Île de la Cité and Place de la Grève (Place de l'Hôtel de Ville).[42] The latter location housed the headquarters of Paris' river trade corporation, an organisation that later became, unofficially (although formally in later years), Paris' first municipal government. In the late 12th century, Philip Augustus extended the Louvre fortress to defend the city against river invasions from the west, gave the city its first walls between 1190 and 1215, rebuilt its bridges to either side of its central island, and paved its main thoroughfares.[43] In 1190, he transformed Paris' former cathedral school into a student-teacher corporation that would become the University of Paris and would draw students from all of Europe.[44][40] With 200,000 inhabitants in 1328, Paris, then already the capital of France, was the most populous city of Europe. By comparison, London in 1300 had 80,000 inhabitants.[45] The Hôtel de Sens, one of many remnants of the Middle Ages in Paris During the Hundred Years' War, Paris was occupied by England-friendly Burgundian forces from 1418, before being occupied outright by the English when Henry V of England entered the French capital in 1420;[46] in spite of a 1429 effort by Joan of Arc to liberate the city,[47] it would remain under English occupation until 1436. In the late 16th-century French Wars of Religion, Paris was a stronghold of the Catholic League, the organisers of 24 August 1572 St. Bartholomew's Day massacre in which thousands of French Protestants were killed.[48][49] The conflicts ended when pretender to the throne Henry IV, after converting to Catholicism to gain entry to the capital, entered the city in 1594 to claim the crown of France. This king made several improvements to the capital during his reign: he completed the construction of Paris' first uncovered, sidewalk-lined bridge, the Pont Neuf, built a Louvre extension connecting it to the Tuileries Palace, and created the first Paris residential square, the Place Royale, now Place des Vosges. In spite of Henry IV's efforts to improve city circulation, the narrowness of Paris' streets was a contributing factor in his assassination near Les Halles marketplace in 1610.[50] During the 17th century, Cardinal Richelieu, chief minister of Louis XIII, was determined to make Paris the most beautiful city in Europe. He built five new bridges, a new chapel for the College of Sorbonne, and a palace for himself, the Palais-Cardinal, which he bequeathed to Louis XIII. After Richelieu's death in 1642, it was renamed the Palais-Royal.[51] Due to the Parisian uprisings during the Fronde civil war, Louis XIV moved his court to a new palace, Versailles, in 1682. Although no longer the capital of France, arts and sciences in the city flourished with the Comédie-Française, the Academy of Painting, and the French Academy of Sciences. To demonstrate that the city was safe from attack, the king had the city walls demolished and replaced with tree-lined boulevards that would become the Grands Boulevards of today.[52] Other marks of his reign were the Collège des Quatre-Nations, the Place Vendôme, the Place des Victoires, and Les Invalides.[53] 18th and 19th centuries[edit] See also: Paris in the 18th century, Paris during the Second Empire, and Haussmann's renovation of Paris Paris grew in population from about 400,000 in 1640 to 650,000 in 1780.[54] A new boulevard, the Champs-Élysées, extended the city west to Étoile,[55] while the working-class neighbourhood of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine on the eastern site of the city grew more and more crowded with poor migrant workers from other regions of France.[56] Paris was the centre of an explosion of philosophic and scientific activity known as the Age of Enlightenment. Diderot and d'Alembert published their Encyclopédie in 1751, and the Montgolfier Brothers launched the first manned flight in a hot-air balloon on 21 November 1783, from the gardens of the Château de la Muette. Paris was the financial capital of continental Europe, the primary European centre of book publishing and fashion and the manufacture of fine furniture and luxury goods.[57] The storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789, by Jean-Pierre Houël In the summer of 1789, Paris became the centre stage for the French Revolution. On 14 July, a mob seized the arsenal at the Invalides, acquiring thousands of guns, and stormed the Bastille, a symbol of royal authority. The first independent Paris Commune, or city council, met in the Hôtel de Ville and, on 15 July, elected a Mayor, the astronomer Jean Sylvain Bailly.[58] Louis XVI and the royal family were brought to Paris and made prisoners within the Tuileries Palace. In 1793, as the revolution turned more and more radical, the king, queen, and the mayor were guillotined (executed) in the Reign of Terror, along with more than 16,000 others throughout France.[59] The property of the aristocracy and the church was nationalised, and the city's churches were closed, sold or demolished.[60] A succession of revolutionary factions ruled Paris until 9 November 1799 (coup d'état du 18 brumaire), when Napoléon Bonaparte seized power as First Consul.[61] The Panthéon, a major landmark on the Rive Gauche, was completed in 1790. The population of Paris had dropped by 100,000 during the Revolution, but between 1799 and 1815, it surged with 160,000 new residents, reaching 660,000.[62] Napoleon Bonaparte replaced the elected government of Paris with a prefect reporting only to him. He began erecting monuments to military glory, including the Arc de Triomphe, and improved the neglected infrastructure of the city with new fountains, the Canal de l'Ourcq, Père Lachaise Cemetery and the city's first metal bridge, the Pont des Arts.[62] During the Restoration, the bridges and squares of Paris were returned to their pre-Revolution names; the July Revolution in 1830 (commemorated by the July Column on the Place de la Bastille) brought a constitutional monarch, Louis Philippe I, to power. The first railway line to Paris opened in 1837, beginning a new period of massive migration from the provinces to the city.[62] Louis-Philippe was overthrown by a popular uprising in the streets of Paris in 1848. His successor, Napoleon III, alongside the newly appointed prefect of the Seine, Georges-Eugène Haussmann, launched a gigantic public works project to build wide new boulevards, a new opera house, a central market, new aqueducts, sewers and parks, including the Bois de Boulogne and Bois de Vincennes.[63] In 1860, Napoleon III also annexed the surrounding towns and created eight new arrondissements, expanding Paris to its current limits.[63] In the 1860s, Paris streets and monuments were illuminated by 56,000 gas lamps, giving it the name ""The City of Light""[64] During the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871), Paris was besieged by the Prussian Army. After months of blockade, hunger, and then bombardment by the Prussians, the city was forced to surrender on 28 January 1871. On 28 March, a revolutionary government called the Paris Commune seized power in Paris. The Commune held power for two months, until it was harshly suppressed by the French army during the ""Bloody Week"" at the end of May 1871.[65] The Eiffel Tower, under construction in November 1888, startled Parisians — and the world — with its modernity. Late in the 19th century, Paris hosted two major international expositions: the 1889 Universal Exposition, was held to mark the centennial of the French Revolution and featured the new Eiffel Tower; and the 1900 Universal Exposition, which gave Paris the Pont Alexandre III, the Grand Palais, the Petit Palais and the first Paris Métro line.[66] Paris became the laboratory of Naturalism (Émile Zola) and Symbolism (Charles Baudelaire and Paul Verlaine), and of Impressionism in art (Courbet, Manet, Monet, Renoir).[67] 20th and 21st centuries[edit] See also: Paris in the Belle Époque, Paris during the First World War, Paris between the Wars (1919–1939), Paris in World War II, and History of Paris (1946–2000) By 1901, the population of Paris had grown to about 2,715,000.[68] At the beginning of the century, artists from around the world including Pablo Picasso, Modigliani, and Henri Matisse made Paris their home. It was the birthplace of Fauvism, Cubism and abstract art,[69][70] and authors such as Marcel Proust were exploring new approaches to literature.[71] During the First World War, Paris sometimes found itself on the front line; 600 to 1,000 Paris taxis played a small but highly important symbolic role in transporting 6,000 soldiers to the front line at the First Battle of the Marne. The city was also bombed by Zeppelins and shelled by German long-range guns.[72] In the years after the war, known as Les Années Folles, Paris continued to be a mecca for writers, musicians and artists from around the world, including Ernest Hemingway, Igor Stravinsky, James Joyce, Josephine Baker, Eva Kotchever, Henry Miller, Anaïs Nin, Sidney Bechet[73] Allen Ginsberg[74] and the surrealist Salvador Dalí.[75] In the years after the peace conference, the city was also home to growing numbers of students and activists from French colonies and other Asian and African countries, who later became leaders of their countries, such as Ho Chi Minh, Zhou Enlai and Léopold Sédar Senghor.[76] General Charles de Gaulle on the Champs-Élysées celebrating the liberation of Paris, 26 August 1944 On 14 June 1940, the German army marched into Paris, which had been declared an ""open city"".[77] On 16–17 July 1942, following German orders, the French police and gendarmes arrested 12,884 Jews, including 4,115 children, and confined them during five days at the Vel d'Hiv (Vélodrome d'Hiver), from which they were transported by train to the extermination camp at Auschwitz. None of the children came back.[78][79] On 25 August 1944, the city was liberated by the French 2nd Armoured Division and the 4th Infantry Division of the United States Army. General Charles de Gaulle led a huge and emotional crowd down the Champs Élysées towards Notre Dame de Paris, and made a rousing speech from the Hôtel de Ville.[80] In the 1950s and the 1960s, Paris became one front of the Algerian War for independence; in August 1961, the pro-independence FLN targeted and killed 11 Paris policemen, leading to the imposition of a curfew on Muslims of Algeria (who, at that time, were French citizens). On 17 October 1961, an unauthorised but peaceful protest demonstration of Algerians against the curfew led to violent confrontations between the police and demonstrators, in which at least 40 people were killed, including some thrown into the Seine. The anti-independence Organisation armée secrète (OAS), for their part, carried out a series of bombings in Paris throughout 1961 and 1962.[81][82] In May 1968, protesting students occupied the Sorbonne and put up barricades in the Latin Quarter. Thousands of Parisian blue-collar workers joined the students, and the movement grew into a two-week general strike. Supporters of the government won the June elections by a large majority. The May 1968 events in France resulted in the break-up of the University of Paris into 13 independent campuses.[83] In 1975, the National Assembly changed the status of Paris to that of other French cities and, on 25 March 1977, Jacques Chirac became the first elected mayor of Paris since 1793.[84] The Tour Maine-Montparnasse, the tallest building in the city at 57 storeys and 210 metres (689 feet) high, was built between 1969 and 1973. It was highly controversial, and it remains the only building in the centre of the city over 32 storeys high.[85] The population of Paris dropped from 2,850,000 in 1954 to 2,152,000 in 1990, as middle-class families moved to the suburbs.[86] A suburban railway network, the RER (Réseau Express Régional), was built to complement the Métro; the Périphérique expressway encircling the city, was completed in 1973.[87] Most of the postwar's Presidents of the Fifth Republic wanted to leave their own monuments in Paris; President Georges Pompidou started the Centre Georges Pompidou (1977), Valéry Giscard d'Estaing began the Musée d'Orsay (1986); President François Mitterrand, in power for 14 years, built the Opéra Bastille (1985–1989), the new site of the Bibliothèque nationale de France (1996), the Arche de la Défense (1985–1989), and the Louvre Pyramid with its underground courtyard (1983–1989); Jacques Chirac (2006), the Musée du quai Branly.[88] Western Paris in 2016, as photographed by a SkySat satellite. In the early 21st century, the population of Paris began to increase slowly again, as more young people moved into the city. It reached 2.25 million in 2011. In March 2001, Bertrand Delanoë became the first Socialist Mayor of Paris. In 2007, in an effort to reduce car traffic in the city, he introduced the Vélib', a system which rents bicycles for the use of local residents and visitors. Bertrand Delanoë also transformed a section of the highway along the Left Bank of the Seine into an urban promenade and park, the Promenade des Berges de la Seine, which he inaugurated in June 2013.[89] In 2007, President Nicolas Sarkozy launched the Grand Paris project, to integrate Paris more closely with the towns in the region around it. After many modifications, the new area, named the Metropolis of Grand Paris, with a population of 6.7 million, was created on 1 January 2016.[90] In 2011, the City of Paris and the national government approved the plans for the Grand Paris Express, totalling 205 kilometres (127 miles) of automated metro lines to connect Paris, the innermost three departments around Paris, airports and high-speed rail (TGV) stations, at an estimated cost of €35 billion.[91] The system is scheduled to be completed by 2030.[92] Terrorist attacks[edit] Further information: 1995 France bombings, Charlie Hebdo shooting, November 2015 Paris attacks, Louvre machete attack, March 2017 Île-de-France attacks, and April 2017 Champs-Élysées attack Anti-terrorism demonstration on the Place de la République after the Charlie Hebdo shooting, 11 January 2015 Between July and October 1995, a series of bombings carried out by the Armed Islamic Group of Algeria caused 8 deaths and more than 200 injuries.[93] On 7 January 2015, two French Muslim extremists attacked the Paris headquarters of Charlie Hebdo and killed thirteen people, in an attack claimed by Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula,[94] and on 9 January, a third terrorist, who claimed he was part of ISIL, killed four hostages during an attack at a Jewish grocery store at Porte de Vincennes.[95] On 11 January an estimated 1.5 million people marched in Paris in a show of solidarity against terrorism and in support of freedom of speech.[96] On 13 November of the same year, a series of coordinated bomb and gunfire terrorist attacks in Paris and Saint-Denis, claimed by ISIL,[97] killed 130 people and injured more than 350.[98] On 3 February 2017, a two-backpack-carrying, machete-wielding attacker shouting ""Allahu Akbar"" attacked soldiers guarding the Louvre museum after they stopped him because of his bags; the assailant was shot, and no explosives were found.[99] On 18 March of the same year, in a Vitry-sur-Seine bar, a man held patrons hostage, then fled to later hold a gun to the head of an Orly Airport French soldier, shouting ""I am here to die in the name of Allah"", and was shot dead by the soldier's comrades.[100] On 20 April, a man fatally shot a French police officer on the Champs-Élysées, and was later shot dead himself.[101] On 19 June, a man rammed his weapons-and-explosives-laden vehicle into a police van on the Champs-Élysées, but the car only burst into flames.[102] Geography[edit] Location[edit] Main article: Geography of Paris Satellite image of Paris by Sentinel-2 Paris in the night from a plane Paris is located in northern central France, in a north-bending arc of the river Seine whose crest includes two islands, the Île Saint-Louis and the larger Île de la Cité, which form the oldest part of the city. The river's mouth on the English Channel (La Manche) is about 233 mi (375 km) downstream from the city. The city is spread widely on both banks of the river.[103] Overall, the city is relatively flat, and the lowest point is 35 m (115 ft) above sea level. Paris has several prominent hills, the highest of which is Montmartre at 130 m (427 ft).[104] Excluding the outlying parks of Bois de Boulogne and Bois de Vincennes, Paris covers an oval measuring about 87 km2 (34 sq mi) in area, enclosed by the 35 km (22 mi) ring road, the Boulevard Périphérique.[105] The city's last major annexation of outlying territories in 1860 not only gave it its modern form but also created the 20 clockwise-spiralling arrondissements (municipal boroughs). From the 1860 area of 78 km2 (30 sq mi), the city limits were expanded marginally to 86.9 km2 (33.6 sq mi) in the 1920s. In 1929, the Bois de Boulogne and Bois de Vincennes forest parks were officially annexed to the city, bringing its area to about 105 km2 (41 sq mi).[106] The metropolitan area of the city is 2,300 km2 (890 sq mi).[103] Measured from the 'point zero' in front of its Notre-Dame cathedral, Paris by road is 450 kilometres (280 mi) southeast of London, 287 kilometres (178 mi) south of Calais, 305 kilometres (190 mi) southwest of Brussels, 774 kilometres (481 mi) north of Marseille, 385 kilometres (239 mi) northeast of Nantes, and 135 kilometres (84 mi) southeast of Rouen.[107] Climate[edit] Main article: Climate of Paris Autumn in Paris Paris has a typical Western European oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb), which is affected by the North Atlantic Current. The overall climate throughout the year is mild and moderately wet.[108] Summer days are usually warm and pleasant with average temperatures between 15 and 25 °C (59 and 77 °F), and a fair amount of sunshine.[109] Each year, however, there are a few days when the temperature rises above 32 °C (90 °F). Longer periods of more intense heat sometimes occur, such as the heat wave of 2003 when temperatures exceeded 30 °C (86 °F) for weeks, reached 40 °C (104 °F) on some days and rarely cooled down at night.[110] Spring and autumn have, on average, mild days and fresh nights but are changing and unstable. Surprisingly warm or cool weather occurs frequently in both seasons.[111] In winter, sunshine is scarce; days are cool, and nights are cold but generally above freezing with low temperatures around 3 °C (37 °F).[112] Light night frosts are however quite common, but the temperature seldom dips below −5 °C (23 °F). Snow falls every year, but rarely stays on the ground. The city sometimes sees light snow or flurries with or without accumulation.[113] Paris has an average annual precipitation of 641 mm (25.2 in), and experiences light rainfall distributed evenly throughout the year. However, the city is known for intermittent, abrupt, heavy showers. The highest recorded temperature was 42.6 °C (108.7 °F) on 25 July 2019,[114] and the lowest was −23.9 °C (−11.0 °F) on 10 December 1879.[115] Climate data for Paris (Parc Montsouris), elevation: 75 m (246 ft), 1981–2010 normals, extremes 1872–present Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °C (°F) 16.1(61.0) 21.4(70.5) 26.0(78.8) 30.2(86.4) 34.8(94.6) 37.6(99.7) 42.6(108.7) 39.5(103.1) 36.2(97.2) 28.9(84.0) 21.6(70.9) 17.1(62.8) 42.6(108.7) Average high °C (°F) 7.2(45.0) 8.3(46.9) 12.2(54.0) 15.6(60.1) 19.6(67.3) 22.7(72.9) 25.2(77.4) 25.0(77.0) 21.1(70.0) 16.3(61.3) 10.8(51.4) 7.5(45.5) 16.0(60.8) Daily mean °C (°F) 4.9(40.8) 5.6(42.1) 8.8(47.8) 11.5(52.7) 15.2(59.4) 18.3(64.9) 20.5(68.9) 20.3(68.5) 16.9(62.4) 13.0(55.4) 8.3(46.9) 5.5(41.9) 12.4(54.3) Average low °C (°F) 2.7(36.9) 2.8(37.0) 5.3(41.5) 7.3(45.1) 10.9(51.6) 13.8(56.8) 15.8(60.4) 15.7(60.3) 12.7(54.9) 9.6(49.3) 5.8(42.4) 3.4(38.1) 8.8(47.8) Record low °C (°F) −14.6(5.7) −14.7(5.5) −9.1(15.6) −3.5(25.7) −0.1(31.8) 3.1(37.6) 2.7(36.9) 6.3(43.3) 1.8(35.2) −3.8(25.2) −14.0(6.8) −23.9(−11.0) −23.9(−11.0) Average precipitation mm (inches) 51.0(2.01) 41.2(1.62) 47.6(1.87) 51.8(2.04) 63.2(2.49) 49.6(1.95) 62.3(2.45) 52.7(2.07) 47.6(1.87) 61.5(2.42) 51.1(2.01) 57.8(2.28) 637.4(25.09) Average precipitation days (≥ 1.0 mm) 9.9 9.0 10.6 9.3 9.8 8.4 8.1 7.7 7.8 9.6 10.0 10.9 111.1 Average snowy days 3.0 3.9 1.6 0.6 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.7 2.1 11.9 Average relative humidity (%) 83 78 73 69 70 69 68 71 76 82 84 84 76 Mean monthly sunshine hours 62.5 79.2 128.9 166.0 193.8 202.1 212.2 212.1 167.9 117.8 67.7 51.4 1,661.6 Percent possible sunshine 22 28 35 39 42 42 43 49 43 35 26 21 35 Average ultraviolet index 1 2 3 4 6 7 7 6 4 3 1 1 4 Source 1: Meteo France,[116][117] Infoclimat.fr (relative humidity 1961–1990)[118] Source 2: Weather Atlas (percent sunshine and UV Index)[119] Administration[edit] Main article: Administration of Paris City government[edit] See also: Arrondissements of Paris and List of mayors of Paris A map of the arrondissements of Paris For almost all of its long history, except for a few brief periods, Paris was governed directly by representatives of the king, emperor, or president of France. The city was not granted municipal autonomy by the National Assembly until 1974.[120] The first modern elected mayor of Paris was Jacques Chirac, elected 20 March 1977, becoming the city's first mayor since 1793. The mayor is Anne Hidalgo, a socialist, first elected 5 April 2014[121] and re-elected 28 June 2020.[122] The mayor of Paris is elected indirectly by Paris voters; the voters of each of the city's 20 arrondissements elect members to the Conseil de Paris (Council of Paris), which subsequently elects the mayor. The council is composed of 163 members, with each arrondissement allocated a number of seats dependent upon its population, from 10 members for each of the least-populated arrondissements (1st through 9th) to 34 members for the most populated (the 15th). The council is elected using closed list proportional representation in a two-round system.[123] Party lists winning an absolute majority in the first round – or at least a plurality in the second round – automatically win half the seats of an arrondissement.[123] The remaining half of seats are distributed proportionally to all lists which win at least 5% of the vote using the highest averages method.[124] This ensures that the winning party or coalition always wins a majority of the seats, even if they don't win an absolute majority of the vote.[123] The Hôtel de Ville, or city hall, has been at the same site since 1357. Once elected, the council plays a largely passive role in the city government, primarily because it meets only once a month. The council is divided between a coalition of the left of 91 members, including the socialists, communists, greens, and extreme left; and 71 members for the centre-right, plus a few members from smaller parties.[125] Each of Paris' 20 arrondissements has its own town hall and a directly elected council (conseil d'arrondissement), which, in turn, elects an arrondissement mayor.[126] The council of each arrondissement is composed of members of the Conseil de Paris and also members who serve only on the council of the arrondissement. The number of deputy mayors in each arrondissement varies depending upon its population. There are a total of 20 arrondissement mayors and 120 deputy mayors.[120] The budget of the city for 2018 is 9.5 billion Euros, with an expected deficit of 5.5 billion Euros. 7.9 billion Euros are designated for city administration, and 1.7 billion Euros for investment. The number of city employees increased from 40,000 in 2001 to 55,000 in 2018. The largest part of the investment budget is earmarked for public housing (262 million Euros) and for real estate (142 million Euros).[127] Métropole du Grand Paris[edit] A map of the Greater Paris Metropolis (Métropole du Grand Paris) and its governing territories. The Métropole du Grand Paris, or simply Grand Paris, formally came into existence on 1 January 2016.[128] It is an administrative structure for co-operation between the City of Paris and its nearest suburbs. It includes the City of Paris, plus the communes of the three departments of the inner suburbs (Hauts-de-Seine, Seine-Saint-Denis and Val-de-Marne), plus seven communes in the outer suburbs, including Argenteuil in Val d'Oise and Paray-Vieille-Poste in Essonne, which were added to include the major airports of Paris. The Metropole covers 814 square kilometres (314 square miles) and has a population of 6.945 million persons.[129][130] The new structure is administered by a Metropolitan Council of 210 members, not directly elected, but chosen by the councils of the member Communes. By 2020 its basic competencies will include urban planning, housing and protection of the environment.[128][130] The first president of the metropolitan council, Patrick Ollier, a Republican and the mayor of the town of Rueil-Malmaison, was elected on 22 January 2016. Though the Metropole has a population of nearly seven million people and accounts for 25 percent of the GDP of France, it has a very small budget: just 65 million Euros, compared with eight billion Euros for the City of Paris.[131] Regional government[edit] The Region of Île de France, including Paris and its surrounding communities, is governed by the Regional Council, which has its headquarters in the 7th arrondissement of Paris. It is composed of 209 members representing the different communes within the region. On 15 December 2015, a list of candidates of the Union of the Right, a coalition of centrist and right-wing parties, led by Valérie Pécresse, narrowly won the regional election, defeating a coalition of Socialists and ecologists. The Socialists had governed the region for seventeen years. The regional council has 121 members from the Union of the Right, 66 from the Union of the Left and 22 from the extreme right National Front.[132] National government[edit] The Élysée Palace, official residence of the President of the French Republic As the capital of France, Paris is the seat of France's national government. For the executive, the two chief officers each have their own official residences, which also serve as their offices. The President of the French Republic resides at the Élysée Palace in the 8th arrondissement,[133] while the Prime Minister's seat is at the Hôtel Matignon in the 7th arrondissement.[134][135] Government ministries are located in various parts of the city; many are located in the 7th arrondissement, near the Hôtel Matignon.[136] Both houses of the French Parliament are located on the Rive Gauche. The upper house, the Senate, meets in the Palais du Luxembourg in the 6th arrondissement, while the more important lower house, the National Assembly, meets in the Palais Bourbon in the 7th arrondissement. The President of the Senate, the second-highest public official in France (the President of the Republic being the sole superior), resides in the Petit Luxembourg, a smaller palace annexe to the Palais du Luxembourg.[137] The Palais-Royal, residence of the Conseil d'État Members of the National Assembly for Paris (elected in 2017) Constituency Member[138] Party Paris' 1st constituency Sylvain Maillard La République En Marche!

The Court of Cassation, the highest court in the judicial order, which reviews criminal and civil cases, is located in the Palais de Justice on the Île de la Cité,[139] while the Conseil d'État, which provides legal advice to the executive and acts as the highest court in the administrative order, judging litigation against public bodies, is located in the Palais-Royal in the 1st arrondissement.[140] The Constitutional Council, an advisory body with ultimate authority on the constitutionality of laws and government decrees, also meets in the Montpensier wing of the Palais Royal.[141] Paris and its region host the headquarters of several international organisations including UNESCO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the International Chamber of Commerce, the Paris Club, the European Space Agency, the International Energy Agency, the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie, the European Union Institute for Security Studies, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, the International Exhibition Bureau, and the International Federation for Human Rights. Following the motto ""Only Paris is worthy of Rome; only Rome is worthy of Paris"";[142] the only sister city of Paris is Rome, although Paris has partnership agreements with many other cities around the world.[142] Police force[edit] Police (Gendarmerie) motorcyclists in Paris The security of Paris is mainly the responsibility of the Prefecture of Police of Paris, a subdivision of the Ministry of the Interior. It supervises the units of the National Police who patrol the city and the three neighbouring departments. It is also responsible for providing emergency services, including the Paris Fire Brigade. Its headquarters is on Place Louis Lépine on the Île de la Cité.[143] There are 30,200 officers under the prefecture, and a fleet of more than 6,000 vehicles, including police cars, motorcycles, fire trucks, boats and helicopters.[143] The national police has its own special unit for riot control and crowd control and security of public buildings, called the Compagnies Républicaines de Sécurité (CRS), a unit formed in 1944 right after the liberation of France. Vans of CRS agents are frequently seen in the centre of the city when there are demonstrations and public events. The police are supported by the National Gendarmerie, a branch of the French Armed Forces, though their police operations now are supervised by the Ministry of the Interior. The traditional kepis of the gendarmes were replaced in 2002 with caps, and the force modernised, though they still wear kepis for ceremonial occasions.[144] Crime in Paris is similar to that in most large cities. Violent crime is relatively rare in the city centre. Political violence is uncommon, though very large demonstrations may occur in Paris and other French cities simultaneously. These demonstrations, usually managed by a strong police presence, can turn confrontational and escalate into violence.[145] Cityscape[edit] Panorama of Paris as seen from the Eiffel Tower in a full 360-degree view (river flowing from north-east to south-west, right to left) Urbanism and architecture[edit] See also: Architecture of Paris, Haussmann's renovation of Paris, Religious buildings in Paris, and List of tallest buildings and structures in the Paris region Most French rulers since the Middle Ages made a point of leaving their mark on a city that, contrary to many other of the world's capitals, has never been destroyed by catastrophe or war. In modernising its infrastructure through the centuries, Paris has preserved even its earliest history in its street map.[146] At its origin, before the Middle Ages, the city was composed of several islands and sandbanks in a bend of the Seine; of those, two remain today: Île Saint-Louis and the Île de la Cité. A third one is the 1827 artificially created Île aux Cygnes. Camille Pissarro, Boulevard Montmartre, 1897, Hermitage Museum Modern Paris owes much of its downtown plan and architectural harmony to Napoleon III and his Prefect of the Seine, Baron Haussmann. Between 1853 and 1870 they rebuilt the city centre, created the wide downtown boulevards and squares where the boulevards intersected, imposed standard facades along the boulevards, and required that the facades be built of the distinctive cream-grey ""Paris stone"". They also built the major parks around the city centre.[147] The high residential population of its city centre also makes it much different from most other western major cities.[148] Rue de Rivoli Place des Vosges Paris' urbanism laws have been under strict control since the early 17th century,[149] particularly where street-front alignment, building height and building distribution is concerned. In recent developments, a 1974–2010 building height limitation of 37 metres (121 ft) was raised to 50 m (160 ft) in central areas and 180 metres (590 ft) in some of Paris' peripheral quarters, yet for some of the city's more central quarters, even older building-height laws still remain in effect.[149] The 210 metres (690 ft) Tour Montparnasse was both Paris's and France's tallest building since 1973,[150] but this record has been held by the La Défense quarter Tour First tower in Courbevoie since its 2011 construction. Parisian examples of historical architectural styles date back more than a millennium, including the Romanesque church of the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés (1014–1163), the early Gothic Architecture of the Basilica of Saint-Denis (1144), the Notre Dame Cathedral (1163–1345), the Flamboyant Gothic of Saint Chapelle (1239–1248), the Baroque churches of Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis (1627–1641) and Les Invalides (1670–1708). The 19th century produced the neoclassical church of La Madeleine (1808–1842), the Palais Garnier serving as an opera house (1875), the neo-Byzantine Basilica of Sacré-Cœur (1875–1919), as well as the exuberant Belle Époque modernism of the Eiffel Tower (1889). Striking examples of 20th-century architecture include the Centre Georges Pompidou by Richard Rogers and Renzo Piano (1977), the Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie by various architects (1986), the Arab World Institute by Jean Nouvel (1987), the Louvre Pyramid by I. M. Pei (1989) and the Opéra Bastille by Carlos Ott (1989). Contemporary architecture includes the Musée du quai Branly – Jacques Chirac by Jean Nouvel (2006), the contemporary art museum of the Louis Vuitton Foundation by Frank Gehry (2014)[151] and the new Tribunal de grande instance de Paris by Renzo Piano (2018). Housing[edit] The most expensive residential streets in Paris in 2018 by average price per square metre were Avenue Montaigne (8th arrondissement), at 22,372 euros per square metre; Place Dauphine (1st arrondissement; 20,373 euros) and the Rue de Furstemberg (6th arrondissement) at 18,839 euros per square metre.[152] The total number of residences in the City of Paris in 2011 was 1,356,074, up from a former high of 1,334,815 in 2006. Among these, 1,165,541 (85.9 percent) were main residences, 91,835 (6.8 percent) were secondary residences, and the remaining 7.3 percent were empty (down from 9.2 percent in 2006).[153] Sixty-two percent of its buildings date from 1949 and before, 20 percent were built between 1949 and 1974, and only 18 percent of the buildings remaining were built after that date.[154] Two-thirds of the city's 1.3 million residences are studio and two-room apartments. Paris averages 1.9 people per residence, a number that has remained constant since the 1980s, but it is much less than Île-de-France's 2.33 person-per-residence average. Only 33 percent of principal residence Parisians own their habitation (against 47 percent for the entire Île-de-France): the major part of the city's population is a rent-paying one.[154] Social or public housing represented 19.9 percent of the city's total residences in 2017. Its distribution varies widely throughout the city, from 2.6 percent of the housing in the wealthy 7th arrondissement, to 24 percent in the 20th arrondissement, 26 percent in the 14th arrondissement and 39.9 percent in the 19th arrondissement, on the poorer southwest and northern edges of the city.[155] On the night of 8–9 February 2019, during a period of cold weather, a Paris NGO conducted its annual citywide count of homeless persons. They counted 3,641 homeless persons in Paris, of whom twelve percent were women. More than half had been homeless for more than a year. 2,885 were living in the streets or parks, 298 in train and metro stations, and 756 in other forms of temporary shelter. This was an increase of 588 persons since 2018.[156] Paris and its suburbs[edit] Paris and its suburbs, as seen from the Spot Satellite West of Paris seen from Tour Montparnasse in 2019 Aside from the 20th-century addition of the Bois de Boulogne, the Bois de Vincennes and the Paris heliport, Paris's administrative limits have remained unchanged since 1860. A greater administrative Seine department had been governing Paris and its suburbs since its creation in 1790, but the rising suburban population had made it difficult to maintain as a unique entity. To address this problem, the parent ""District de la région parisienne"" ('district of the Paris region') was reorganised into several new departments from 1968: Paris became a department in itself, and the administration of its suburbs was divided between the three new departments surrounding it. The district of the Paris region was renamed ""Île-de-France"" in 1977, but this abbreviated ""Paris region"" name is still commonly used today to describe the Île-de-France, and as a vague reference to the entire Paris agglomeration.[157] Long-intended measures to unite Paris with its suburbs began on 1 January 2016, when the Métropole du Grand Paris came into existence.[128] Paris' disconnect with its suburbs, its lack of suburban transportation, in particular, became all too apparent with the Paris agglomeration's growth. Paul Delouvrier promised to resolve the Paris-suburbs mésentente when he became head of the Paris region in 1961:[158] two of his most ambitious projects for the Region were the construction of five suburban ""villes nouvelles"" (""new cities"")[159] and the RER commuter train network.[160] Many other suburban residential districts (grands ensembles) were built between the 1960s and 1970s to provide a low-cost solution for a rapidly expanding population:[161] These districts were socially mixed at first,[162] but few residents actually owned their homes (the growing economy made these accessible to the middle classes only from the 1970s).[163] Their poor construction quality and their haphazard insertion into existing urban growth contributed to their desertion by those able to move elsewhere and their repopulation by those with more limited possibilities.[163] These areas, quartiers sensibles (""sensitive quarters""), are in northern and eastern Paris, namely around its Goutte d'Or and Belleville neighbourhoods. To the north of the city, they are grouped mainly in the Seine-Saint-Denis department, and to a lesser extreme to the east in the Val-d'Oise department. Other difficult areas are located in the Seine valley, in Évry et Corbeil-Essonnes (Essonne), in Mureaux, Mantes-la-Jolie (Yvelines), and scattered among social housing districts created by Delouvrier's 1961 ""ville nouvelle"" political initiative.[164] The Paris agglomeration's urban sociology is basically that of 19th-century Paris: its fortuned classes are situated in its west and southwest, and its middle-to-lower classes are in its north and east. The remaining areas are mostly middle-class citizenry dotted with islands of fortuned populations located there due to reasons of historical importance, namely Saint-Maur-des-Fossés to the east and Enghien-les-Bains to the north of Paris.[165] Demographics[edit] Main article: Demographics of Paris 2015 Census Paris Region[166][167] Country/territory of birth Population Metropolitan France 9,165,570 Algeria 310,019 Portugal 243,490 Morocco 241,403 Tunisia 117,161 Guadeloupe 80,062 Martinique 77,300 Turkey 69,835 China 67,540 Mali 60,438 Italy 56,692 Côte d'Ivoire 55,022 Senegal 52,758 Romania 49,124 Democratic Republic of Congo 47,091 Spain 47,058 Other countries/territories Sri Lanka 42,016 Cameroon 41,749 Poland 38,550 Republic of the Congo 36,354 Haiti 35,855 Vietnam 35,139 Cambodia 31,258 Réunion 28,869 India 26,507 Serbia 26,119 Germany 21,620 Lebanon 20,375 Mauritius 19,506 Madagascar 19,281 Pakistan 18,801 United Kingdom 18,209 Russia 18,022 United States 17,548 Other countries and territories 846,914 The official estimated population of the City of Paris was 2,206,488 as of 1 January 2019[update], according to the INSEE, the official French statistical agency. This is a decline of 59,648 from 2015, close to the total population of the 5th arrondissement.[168] Despite the drop, Paris remains the most densely-populated city in Europe, with 252 residents per hectare, not counting parks.[168] This drop was attributed partly to a lower birth rate, to the departure of middle-class residents. and partly to the possible loss of housing in the city due to short-term rentals for tourism.[169] Paris is the fourth largest municipality in the European Union, following Berlin, Madrid and Rome. Eurostat places Paris (6.5 million people) behind London (8 million) and ahead of Berlin (3.5 million), based on the 2012 populations of what Eurostat calls ""urban audit core cities"".[170] City proper, urban area, and metropolitan area population from 1800 to 2010 The population of Paris today is lower than its historical peak of 2.9 million in 1921.[171] The principal reasons were a significant decline in household size, and a dramatic migration of residents to the suburbs between 1962 and 1975. Factors in the migration included de-industrialisation, high rent, the gentrification of many inner quarters, the transformation of living space into offices, and greater affluence among working families. The city's population loss came to a temporary halt at the beginning of the 21st century; the population increased from 2,125,246 in 1999 to 2,240,621 in 2012, before declining again slightly in 2017.[172] It declined again in 2018. Paris is the core of a built-up area that extends well beyond its limits: commonly referred to as the agglomération Parisienne, and statistically as a unité urbaine (a measure of urban area), the Paris agglomeration's 2017 population of 10,784,830[173] made it the largest urban area in the European Union.[174] City-influenced commuter activity reaches well beyond even this in a statistical aire urbaine de Paris (""urban area"", but a statistical method comparable to a metropolitan area[175]), that had a 2017 population of 12,628,266,[176] a number 19% the population of France,[177] and the largest metropolitan area in the Eurozone.[174] According to Eurostat, the EU statistical agency, in 2012 the Commune of Paris was the most densely populated city in the European Union, with 21,616 people per square kilometre within the city limits (the NUTS-3 statistical area), ahead of Inner London West, which had 10,374 people per square kilometre. According to the same census, three departments bordering Paris, Hauts-de-Seine, Seine-Saint-Denis and Val-de-Marne, had population densities of over 10,000 people per square kilometre, ranking among the 10 most densely populated areas of the EU.[178][verification needed] Migration[edit] According to the 2012 French census, 586,163 residents of the City of Paris, or 26.2 percent, and 2,782,834 residents of the Paris Region (Île-de-France), or 23.4 percent, were born outside of metropolitan France (the last figure up from 22.4% at the 2007 census).[166] 26,700 of these in the City of Paris and 210,159 in the Paris Region were people born in Overseas France (more than two-thirds of whom in the French West Indies) and are therefore not counted as immigrants since they were legally French citizens at birth.[166] A further 103,648 in the City of Paris and in 412,114 in the Paris Region were born in foreign countries with French citizenship at birth.[166] This concerns in particular the many Christians and Jews from North Africa who moved to France and Paris after the times of independence and are not counted as immigrants due to their being born French citizens. The remaining group, people born in foreign countries with no French citizenship at birth, are those defined as immigrants under French law. According to the 2012 census, 135,853 residents of the City of Paris were immigrants from Europe, 112,369 were immigrants from the Maghreb, 70,852 from sub-Saharan Africa and Egypt, 5,059 from Turkey, 91,297 from Asia (outside Turkey), 38,858 from the Americas, and 1,365 from the South Pacific.[179] Note that the immigrants from the Americas and the South Pacific in Paris are vastly outnumbered by migrants from French overseas regions and territories located in these regions of the world.[166] In the Paris Region, 590,504 residents were immigrants from Europe, 627,078 were immigrants from the Maghreb, 435,339 from sub-Saharan Africa and Egypt, 69,338 from Turkey, 322,330 from Asia (outside Turkey), 113,363 from the Americas, and 2,261 from the South Pacific.[180] These last two groups of immigrants are again vastly outnumbered by migrants from French overseas regions and territories located in the Americas and the South Pacific.[166][clarification needed] In 2012, there were 8,810 British citizens and 10,019 United States citizens living in the City of Paris (Ville de Paris) and 20,466 British citizens and 16,408 United States citizens living in the entire Paris Region (Île-de-France).[181][182] Religion[edit] See also: Religious buildings in Paris Sacré-Cœur in Montmartre St-Gervais-et-St-Protais in Le Marais At the beginning of the twentieth century, Paris was the largest Catholic city in the world.[183] French census data does not contain information about religious affiliation.[184] According to a 2011 survey by the Institut français d'opinion publique (IFOP), a French public opinion research organisation, 61 percent of residents of the Paris Region (Île-de-France) identified themselves as Roman Catholic. In the same survey, 7 percent of residents identified themselves as Muslims, 4 percent as Protestants, 2 percent as Jewish and 25 percent as without religion. According to the INSEE, between 4 and 5 million French residents were born or had at least one parent born in a predominantly Muslim country, particularly Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia. An IFOP survey in 2008 reported that, of immigrants from these predominantly Muslim countries, 25 percent went to the mosque regularly; 41 percent practised the religion, and 34 percent were believers but did not practice the religion.[185][186] In 2012 and 2013, it was estimated that there were almost 500,000 Muslims in the City of Paris, 1.5 million Muslims in the Île-de-France region and 4 to 5 million Muslims in France.[187][188] The Jewish population of the Paris Region was estimated in 2014 to be 282,000, the largest concentration of Jews in the world outside of Israel and the United States.[189] International organisations[edit] The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has had its headquarters in Paris since November 1958. Paris is also the home of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).[190] Paris hosts the headquarters of the European Space Agency, the International Energy Agency, European Securities and Markets Authority and, as of 2019[update], the European Banking Authority. Economy[edit] Main article: Economy of Paris La Défense, the largest dedicated business district in Europe[191] Companies with world headquartersin the Paris Region ranked by revenue(2018) Parisranking Corporation Worldranking 1 AXA 27 2 Total S.A. 28 3 BNP Paribas 44 4 Carrefour 68 5 Crédit Agricole 82 6 EDF 94 7 Engie 104 8 Peugeot 108 9 Société Générale 121 10 Renault 134 Source: Fortune Global 500 (2018) The Eiffel Tower and the La Défense district The economy of the City of Paris is based largely on services and commerce; of the 390,480 enterprises in the city, 80.6 percent are engaged in commerce, transportation, and diverse services, 6.5 percent in construction, and just 3.8 percent in industry.[192] The story is similar in the Paris Region (Île-de-France): 76.7 percent of enterprises are engaged in commerce and services, and 3.4 percent in industry.[193] At the 2012 census, 59.5% of jobs in the Paris Region were in market services (12.0% in wholesale and retail trade, 9.7% in professional, scientific, and technical services, 6.5% in information and communication, 6.5% in transportation and warehousing, 5.9% in finance and insurance, 5.8% in administrative and support services, 4.6% in accommodation and food services, and 8.5% in various other market services), 26.9% in non-market services (10.4% in human health and social work activities, 9.6% in public administration and defence, and 6.9% in education), 8.2% in manufacturing and utilities (6.6% in manufacturing and 1.5% in utilities), 5.2% in construction, and 0.2% in agriculture.[194][195] The Paris Region had 5.4 million salaried employees in 2010, of whom 2.2 million were concentrated in 39 pôles d'emplois or business districts. The largest of these, in terms of number of employees, is known in French as the QCA, or quartier central des affaires; it is in the western part of the City of Paris, in the 2nd, 8th, 9th, 16th, and 18th arrondissements. In 2010, it was the workplace of 500,000 salaried employees, about 30 percent of the salaried employees in Paris and 10 percent of those in the Île-de-France. The largest sectors of activity in the central business district were finance and insurance (16 percent of employees in the district) and business services (15 percent). The district also includes a large concentration of department stores, shopping areas, hotels and restaurants, as well a government offices and ministries.[196] The second-largest business district in terms of employment is La Défense, just west of the city, where many companies installed their offices in the 1990s. In 2010, it was the workplace of 144,600 employees, of whom 38 percent worked in finance and insurance, 16 percent in business support services. Two other important districts, Neuilly-sur-Seine and Levallois-Perret, are extensions of the Paris business district and of La Défense. Another district, including Boulogne-Billancourt, Issy-les-Moulineaux and the southern part of the 15th arrondissement, is a centre of activity for the media and information technology.[196] The top ten French companies listed in the Fortune Global 500 for 2018 all have their headquarters in the Paris Region; six in the central business district of the City of Paris; and four close to the city in the Hauts-de-Seine Department, three in La Défense and one in Boulogne-Billancourt. Some companies, like Société Générale, have offices in both Paris and La Défense. The Paris Region is France's leading region for economic activity, with a GDP of €681 billion (~US$850 billion) and €56,000 (~US$70,000) per capita.[6] In 2011, its GDP ranked second among the regions of Europe and its per-capita GDP was the 4th highest in Europe.[197][198] While the Paris region's population accounted for 18.8 percent of metropolitan France in 2011,[199] the Paris region's GDP accounted for 30 percent of metropolitan France's GDP.[200] The Paris Region economy has gradually shifted from industry to high-value-added service industries (finance, IT services) and high-tech manufacturing (electronics, optics, aerospace, etc.).[201] The Paris region's most intense economic activity through the central Hauts-de-Seine department and suburban La Défense business district places Paris' economic centre to the west of the city, in a triangle between the Opéra Garnier, La Défense and the Val de Seine.[201] While the Paris economy is dominated by services, and employment in manufacturing sector has declined sharply, the region remains an important manufacturing centre, particularly for aeronautics, automobiles, and ""eco"" industries.[201] In the 2017 worldwide cost of living survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, based on a survey made in September 2016, Paris ranked as the seventh most expensive city in the world, and the second most expensive in Europe, after Zurich.[202] In 2018, Paris was the most expensive city in the world with Singapore and Hong Kong.[203] Station F is a business incubator for startups, located in 13th arrondissement of Paris. Noted as the world's largest startup facility.[204] Employment[edit] Employment by economic sector in the Paris area (petite couronne), with population and unemployment figures (2015) According to 2015 INSEE figures, 68.3 percent of employees in the City of Paris work in commerce, transportation, and services; 24.5 percent in public administration, health and social services; 4.1 percent in industry, and 0.1 percent in agriculture.[205] The majority of Paris' salaried employees fill 370,000 businesses services jobs, concentrated in the north-western 8th, 16th and 17th arrondissements.[206] Paris' financial service companies are concentrated in the central-western 8th and 9th arrondissement banking and insurance district.[206] Paris' department store district in the 1st, 6th, 8th and 9th arrondissements employ ten percent of mostly female Paris workers, with 100,000 of these registered in the retail trade.[206] Fourteen percent of Parisians work in hotels and restaurants and other services to individuals.[206] Nineteen percent of Paris employees work for the State in either administration or education. The majority of Paris' healthcare and social workers work at the hospitals and social housing concentrated in the peripheral 13th, 14th, 18th, 19th and 20th arrondissements.[206] Outside Paris, the western Hauts-de-Seine department La Défense district specialising in finance, insurance and scientific research district, employs 144,600,[201] and the north-eastern Seine-Saint-Denis audiovisual sector has 200 media firms and 10 major film studios.[201] Paris' manufacturing is mostly focused in its suburbs, and the city itself has only around 75,000 manufacturing workers, most of which are in the textile, clothing, leather goods, and shoe trades.[201] Paris region manufacturing specialises in transportation, mainly automobiles, aircraft and trains, but this is in a sharp decline: Paris proper manufacturing jobs dropped by 64 percent between 1990 and 2010, and the Paris region lost 48 percent during the same period. Most of this is due to companies relocating outside the Paris region. The Paris region's 800 aerospace companies employed 100,000.[201] Four hundred automobile industry companies employ another 100,000 workers: many of these are centred in the Yvelines department around the Renault and PSA-Citroen plants (this department alone employs 33,000),[201] but the industry as a whole suffered a major loss with the 2014 closing of a major Aulnay-sous-Bois Citroen assembly plant.[201] The southern Essonne department specialises in science and technology,[201] and the south-eastern Val-de-Marne, with its wholesale Rungis food market, specialises in food processing and beverages.[201] The Paris region's manufacturing decline is quickly being replaced by eco-industries: these employ about 100,000 workers.[201] In 2011, while only 56,927 construction workers worked in Paris itself,[207] its metropolitan area employed 246,639,[205] in an activity centred largely on the Seine-Saint-Denis (41,378)[208] and Hauts-de-Seine (37,303)[209] departments and the new business-park centres appearing there. Unemployment[edit] Paris' 2015 at-census unemployment rate was 12.2%,[205] and in the first trimester of 2018, its ILO-critera unemployment rate was 7.1 percent. The provisional unemployment rate in the whole Paris Region was higher: 8.0 percent, and considerably higher in some suburbs, notably the Department of Seine-Saint-Denis to the east (11.8 percent) and the Val-d'Oise to the north (8.2 percent).[210] Incomes[edit] Median income in Paris and its nearest departments The average net household income (after social, pension and health insurance contributions) in Paris was €36,085 for 2011.[211] It ranged from €22,095 in the 19th arrondissement[212] to €82,449 in the 7th arrondissement.[213] The median taxable income for 2011 was around €25,000 in Paris and €22,200 for Île-de-France.[214] Generally speaking, incomes are higher in the Western part of the city and in the western suburbs than in the northern and eastern parts of the urban area.[215] Unemployment was estimated at 8.2 percent in the City of Paris and 8.8 percent in the Île-de-France region in the first trimester of 2015. It ranged from 7.6 percent in the wealthy Essonne department to 13.1 percent in the Seine-Saint-Denis department, where many recent immigrants live.[216] While Paris has some of the richest neighbourhoods in France, it also has some of the poorest, mostly on the eastern side of the city. In 2012, 14 percent of households in the city earned less than €977 per month, the official poverty line. Twenty-five percent of residents in the 19th arrondissement lived below the poverty line; 24 percent in the 18th, 22 percent in the 20th and 18 percent in the 10th. In the city's wealthiest neighbourhood, the 7th arrondissement, 7 percent lived below the poverty line; 8 percent in the 6th arrondissement; and 9 percent in the 16th arrondissement.[217] Tourism[edit] Main article: Tourism in Paris Tourists from around the world make the Louvre the most-visited art museum in the world. Greater Paris, comprising Paris and its three surrounding departments, received 38 million visitors in 2019, a record, measured by hotel arrivals.[17] These included 12.2 million French visitors. Of foreign visitors, the greatest number came from the United States (2.6 million), United Kingdom (1.2 million), Germany (981 thousand) and China (711 thousand).[17] However, tourism to Paris and its region fell to 17.5 million in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with a 78 percent drop in foreign tourists measured by hotel stays, and a drop of 56 percent in French guests, for an overall drop of 68 percent. This caused a drop 15 billion Euros in hotel receipts.[218] In 2018, measured by the Euromonitor Global Cities Destination Index, Paris was the second-busiest airline destination in the world, with 19.10 million visitors, behind Bangkok (22.78 million) but ahead of London (19.09 million).[219] According to the Paris Convention and Visitors Bureau, 393,008 workers in Greater Paris, or 12.4% of the total workforce, are engaged in tourism-related sectors such as hotels, catering, transport and leisure.[220] Monuments and attractions[edit] Main articles: Landmarks in Paris, Historical quarters of Paris, and List of tourist attractions in Paris See also: List of most visited museums The Passage Jouffroy, one of Paris's covered passages The city's top cultural attraction in 2019 was the Basilica of Sacré-Cœur (11 million visitors), followed by the Louvre (9.6 million visitors); the Eiffel Tower (6.1 million visitors); the Centre Pompidou (3.5 million visitors); and the Musée d'Orsay (3.3 million visitors).[17] Paris, Banks of the SeineUNESCO World Heritage SiteCriteriaCultural: i, ii, ivReference600Inscription1991 (15th Session)Area365 ha The centre of Paris contains the most visited monuments in the city, including the Notre Dame Cathedral (now closed for restoration) and the Louvre as well as the Sainte-Chapelle; Les Invalides, where the tomb of Napoleon is located, and the Eiffel Tower are located on the Left Bank south-west of the centre. The Panthéon and the Catacombs of Paris are also located on the Left Bank of the Seine. The banks of the Seine from the Pont de Sully to the Pont d'Iéna have been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1991.[221] The Axe historique, pictured here from Concorde to Grande Arche of La Défense Other landmarks are laid out east to west along the historical axis of Paris, which runs from the Louvre through the Tuileries Garden, the Luxor Column in the Place de la Concorde, and the Arc de Triomphe, to the Grande Arche of La Défense. The Eiffel Tower is one of the most visited monuments in the World Several other much-visited landmarks are located in the suburbs of the city; the Basilica of St Denis, in Seine-Saint-Denis, is the birthplace of the Gothic style of architecture and the royal necropolis of French kings and queens.[222] The Paris region hosts three other UNESCO Heritage sites: the Palace of Versailles in the west,[223] the Palace of Fontainebleau in the south,[224] and the medieval fairs site of Provins in the east.[225] In the Paris region, Disneyland Paris, in Marne-la-Vallée, 32 kilometres (20 miles) east of the centre of Paris, received 9.66 million visitors in 2017.[226] Hotels[edit] In 2019 Greater Paris had 2,056 hotels, including 94 five-star hotels, with a total of 121,646 rooms.[17] Paris has long been famous for its grand hotels. The Hotel Meurice, opened for British travellers in 1817, was one of the first luxury hotels in Paris.[227] The arrival of the railways and the Paris Exposition of 1855 brought the first flood of tourists and the first modern grand hotels; the Hôtel du Louvre (now an antiques marketplace) in 1855; the Grand Hotel (now the InterContinental Paris Le Grand Hotel) in 1862; and the Hôtel Continental in 1878. The Hôtel Ritz on Place Vendôme opened in 1898, followed by the Hôtel Crillon in an 18th-century building on the Place de la Concorde in 1909; the Hotel Bristol on the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré in 1925; and the Hotel George V in 1928.[228] In addition to hotels, in 2019 Greater Paris had 60,000 homes registered with Airbnb.[17] Under French law, renters of these units must pay the Paris tourism tax. The company paid the city government 7.3 million euros in 2016.[229] Culture[edit] Painting and sculpture[edit] Main article: Art in Paris Pierre Mignard, Self-portrait, between 1670 and 1690, oil on canvas, 235 cm × 188 cm (93 in × 74 in), The Louvre For centuries, Paris has attracted artists from around the world, who arrive in the city to educate themselves and to seek inspiration from its vast pool of artistic resources and galleries. As a result, Paris has acquired a reputation as the ""City of Art"".[230] Italian artists were a profound influence on the development of art in Paris in the 16th and 17th centuries, particularly in sculpture and reliefs. Painting and sculpture became the pride of the French monarchy and the French royal family commissioned many Parisian artists to adorn their palaces during the French Baroque and Classicism era. Sculptors such as Girardon, Coysevox and Coustou acquired reputations as the finest artists in the royal court in 17th-century France. Pierre Mignard became the first painter to King Louis XIV during this period. In 1648, the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture (Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture) was established to accommodate for the dramatic interest in art in the capital. This served as France's top art school until 1793.[231] Auguste Renoir, Bal du moulin de la Galette, 1876, oil on canvas, 131 cm × 175 cm (52 in × 69 in), Musée d'Orsay Paris was in its artistic prime in the 19th century and early 20th century, when it had a colony of artists established in the city and in art schools associated with some of the finest painters of the times: Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Édouard Manet, Claude Monet, Berthe Morisot, Paul Gauguin, Pierre-Auguste Renoir and others. The French Revolution and political and social change in France had a profound influence on art in the capital. Paris was central to the development of Romanticism in art, with painters such as Géricault.[231] Impressionism, Art Nouveau, Symbolism, Fauvism, Cubism and Art Deco movements all evolved in Paris.[231] In the late 19th century, many artists in the French provinces and worldwide flocked to Paris to exhibit their works in the numerous salons and expositions and make a name for themselves.[232] Artists such as Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Vincent van Gogh, Paul Cézanne, Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Henri Rousseau, Marc Chagall, Amedeo Modigliani and many others became associated with Paris. Picasso, living in Le Bateau-Lavoir in Montmartre, painted his famous La Famille de Saltimbanques and Les Demoiselles d'Avignon between 1905 and 1907.[233] Montmartre and Montparnasse became centres for artistic production. The most prestigious names of French and foreign sculptors, who made their reputation in Paris in the modern era, are Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi (Statue of Liberty – Liberty Enlightening the World), Auguste Rodin, Camille Claudel, Antoine Bourdelle, Paul Landowski (statue of Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro) and Aristide Maillol. The Golden Age of the School of Paris ended between the two world wars. Photography[edit] The inventor Nicéphore Niépce produced the first permanent photograph on a polished pewter plate in Paris in 1825. In 1839, after the death of Niépce, Louis Daguerre patented the Daguerrotype, which became the most common form of photography until the 1860s. [231] The work of Étienne-Jules Marey in the 1880s contributed considerably to the development of modern photography. Photography came to occupy a central role in Parisian Surrealist activity, in the works of Man Ray and Maurice Tabard.[234][235] Numerous photographers achieved renown for their photography of Paris, including Eugène Atget, noted for his depictions of street scenes, Robert Doisneau, noted for his playful pictures of people and market scenes (among which Le baiser de l'hôtel de ville has become iconic of the romantic vision of Paris), Marcel Bovis, noted for his night scenes, as well as others such as Jacques-Henri Lartigue and Henri Cartier-Bresson.[231] Poster art also became an important art form in Paris in the late nineteenth century, through the work of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Jules Chéret, Eugène Grasset, Adolphe Willette, Pierre Bonnard, Georges de Feure, Henri-Gabriel Ibels, Paul Gavarni and Alphonse Mucha.[231] Museums[edit] Main article: List of museums in Paris Louvre Musée d'Orsay The Louvre received 2.7 million visitors in 2020, a drop of 72 percent from the 9.6 million visitors in 2019. The Louvre was closed for 150 days during the year because of the Covid-19 virus, but it still retained its position as first in the list of the Most visited art museums in the world. [236] Its treasures include the Mona Lisa (La Joconde), the Venus de Milo statue, Liberty Leading the People. The second-most visited museum in the city in 2020, and 12th most visited art museum in the world, with 3.5 million visitors, was the Centre Georges Pompidou, also known as Beaubourg, which houses the Musée National d'Art Moderne.[17] The third most visited Paris museum, in a building constructed for the Paris Universal Exhibition of 1900 as the Orsay railway station, was the Musée d'Orsay, which had 3.3 million visitors in 2020, the 12th most visited art museum in 2020, but a drop of 76 percent in visitors from 2019.[237] The Orsay displays French art of the 19th century, including major collections of the Impressionists and Post-Impressionists. The Musée de l'Orangerie, near both the Louvre and the Orsay, also exhibits Impressionists and Post-Impressionists, including most of Claude Monet's large Water Lilies murals. The Musée national du Moyen Âge, or Cluny Museum, presents Medieval art, including the famous tapestry cycle of The Lady and the Unicorn. The Guimet Museum, or Musée national des arts asiatiques, has one of the largest collections of Asian art in Europe. There are also notable museums devoted to individual artists, including the Musée Picasso, the Musée Rodin and the Musée national Eugène Delacroix. Musée du quai Branly Paris hosts one of the largest science museums in Europe, the Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie at La Villette. It attracted 2.2 million visitors in 2018.[238] The National Museum of Natural History located near the Jardin des plantes attracted two million visitors in 2018.[238] It is famous for its dinosaur artefacts, mineral collections and its Gallery of Evolution. The military history of France, from the Middle Ages to World War II, is vividly presented by displays at the Musée de l'Armée at Les Invalides, near the tomb of Napoleon. In addition to the national museums, run by the Ministry of Culture, the City of Paris operates 14 museums, including the Carnavalet Museum on the history of Paris, Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, Palais de Tokyo, the House of Victor Hugo, the House of Balzac and the Catacombs of Paris.[239] There are also notable private museums; The Contemporary Art museum of the Louis Vuitton Foundation, designed by architect Frank Gehry, opened in October 2014 in the Bois de Boulogne. Theatre[edit] The Opéra Bastille The largest opera houses of Paris are the 19th-century Opéra Garnier (historical Paris Opéra) and modern Opéra Bastille; the former tends toward the more classic ballets and operas, and the latter provides a mixed repertoire of classic and modern.[240] In middle of the 19th century, there were three other active and competing opera houses: the Opéra-Comique (which still exists), Théâtre-Italien and Théâtre Lyrique (which in modern times changed its profile and name to Théâtre de la Ville).[241] Philharmonie de Paris, the modern symphonic concert hall of Paris, opened in January 2015. Another musical landmark is the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, where the first performances of Diaghilev's Ballets Russes took place in 1913. The Comédie Française (Salle Richelieu) Theatre traditionally has occupied a large place in Parisian culture, and many of its most popular actors today are also stars of French television. The oldest and most famous Paris theatre is the Comédie-Française, founded in 1680. Run by the Government of France, it performs mostly French classics at the Salle Richelieu in the Palais-Royal at 2 rue de Richelieu, next to the Louvre.[242] of Other famous theatres include the Odéon-Théâtre de l'Europe, next to the Luxembourg Gardens, also a state institution and theatrical landmark; the Théâtre Mogador, and the Théâtre de la Gaîté-Montparnasse.[243] The music hall and cabaret are famous Paris institutions. The Moulin Rouge was opened in 1889. It was highly visible because of its large red imitation windmill on its roof, and became the birthplace of the dance known as the French Cancan. It helped make famous the singers Mistinguett and Édith Piaf and the painter Toulouse-Lautrec, who made posters for the venue. In 1911, the dance hall Olympia Paris invented the grand staircase as a settling for its shows, competing with its great rival, the Folies Bergère. Its stars in the 1920s included the American singer and dancer Josephine Baker. Later, Olympia Paris presented Dalida, Edith Piaf, Marlene Dietrich, Miles Davis, Judy Garland and the Grateful Dead. The Casino de Paris presented many famous French singers, including Mistinguett, Maurice Chevalier and Tino Rossi. Other famous Paris music halls include Le Lido, on the Champs-Élysées, opened in 1946; and the Crazy Horse Saloon, featuring strip-tease, dance and magic, opened in 1951. A half dozen music halls exist today in Paris, attended mostly by visitors to the city.[244] Literature[edit] Main article: Writers in Paris Victor Hugo The first book printed in France, Epistolae (""Letters""), by Gasparinus de Bergamo (Gasparino da Barzizza), was published in Paris in 1470 by the press established by Johann Heynlin. Since then, Paris has been the centre of the French publishing industry, the home of some of the world's best-known writers and poets, and the setting for many classic works of French literature. Almost all the books published in Paris in the Middle Ages were in Latin, rather than French. Paris did not become the acknowledged capital of French literature until the 17th century, with authors such as Boileau, Corneille, La Fontaine, Molière, Racine, Charles Perrault,[245] several coming from the provinces, as well as the foundation of the Académie française.[246] In the 18th century, the literary life of Paris revolved around the cafés and salons; it was dominated by Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Pierre de Marivaux and Pierre Beaumarchais. During the 19th century, Paris was the home and subject for some of France's greatest writers, including Charles Baudelaire, Stéphane Mallarmé, Mérimée, Alfred de Musset, Marcel Proust, Émile Zola, Alexandre Dumas, Gustave Flaubert, Guy de Maupassant and Honoré de Balzac. Victor Hugo's The Hunchback of Notre Dame inspired the renovation of its setting, the Notre-Dame de Paris.[247] Another of Victor Hugo's works, Les Misérables, written while he was in exile outside France during the Second Empire, described the social change and political turmoil in Paris in the early 1830s.[248] One of the most popular of all French writers, Jules Verne, worked at the Theatre Lyrique and the Paris stock exchange, while he did research for his stories at the National Library.[249][verification needed] Jean-Paul Sartre In the 20th century, the Paris literary community was dominated by figures such as Colette, André Gide, François Mauriac, André Malraux, Albert Camus, and, after World War II, by Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre. Between the wars it was the home of many important expatriate writers, including Ernest Hemingway, Samuel Beckett, Miguel Ángel Asturias, Alejo Carpentier and, Arturo Uslar Pietri. The winner of the 2014 Nobel Prize in Literature, Patrick Modiano (who lives in Paris), based most of his literary work on the depiction of the city during World War II and the 1960s–1970s.[250] Paris is a city of books and bookstores. In the 1970s, 80 percent of French-language publishing houses were found in Paris, almost all on the Left Bank in the 5th, 6th and 7th arrondissements. Since that time, because of high prices, some publishers have moved out to the less expensive areas.[251] It is also a city of small bookstores. There are about 150 bookstores in the 5th arrondissement alone, plus another 250 book stalls along the Seine. Small Paris bookstores are protected against competition from discount booksellers by French law; books, even e-books, cannot be discounted more than five percent below their publisher's cover price.[252] Music[edit] Main articles: Music in Paris and History of music in Paris Olympia, a famous music hall In the late 12th century, a school of polyphony was established at Notre-Dame. Among the Trouvères of northern France, a group of Parisian aristocrats became known for their poetry and songs. Troubadours, from the south of France, were also popular. During the reign of François I, in the Renaissance era, the lute became popular in the French court. The French royal family and courtiers ""disported themselves in masques, ballets, allegorical dances, recitals, and opera and comedy"", and a national musical printing house was established.[231] In the Baroque-era, noted composers included Jean-Baptiste Lully, Jean-Philippe Rameau, and François Couperin.[231] The Conservatoire de Musique de Paris was founded in 1795.[253] By 1870, Paris had become an important centre for symphony, ballet and operatic music. Romantic-era composers (in Paris) include Hector Berlioz (La Symphonie fantastique), Charles Gounod (Faust), Camille Saint-Saëns (Samson et Delilah), Léo Delibes (Lakmé) and Jules Massenet (Thaïs), among others.[231] Georges Bizet's Carmen premiered 3 March 1875. Carmen has since become one of the most popular and frequently-performed operas in the classical canon.[254][255] Among the Impressionist composers who created new works for piano, orchestra, opera, chamber music and other musical forms, stand in particular, Claude Debussy (Suite bergamasque, and its well-known third movement, Clair de lune, La Mer, Pelléas et Mélisande), Erik Satie (Gymnopédies, ""Je te veux"", Gnossiennes, Parade) and Maurice Ravel (Miroirs, Boléro, La valse, L'heure espagnole). Several foreign-born composers, such as Frédéric Chopin (Poland), Franz Liszt (Hungary), Jacques Offenbach (Germany), Niccolò Paganini (Italy), and Igor Stravinsky (Russia), established themselves or made significant contributions both with their works and their influence in Paris. Charles Aznavour Bal-musette is a style of French music and dance that first became popular in Paris in the 1870s and 1880s; by 1880 Paris had some 150 dance halls in the working-class neighbourhoods of the city.[256] Patrons danced the bourrée to the accompaniment of the cabrette (a bellows-blown bagpipe locally called a ""musette"") and often the vielle à roue (hurdy-gurdy) in the cafés and bars of the city. Parisian and Italian musicians who played the accordion adopted the style and established themselves in Auvergnat bars especially in the 19th arrondissement,[257] and the romantic sounds of the accordion has since become one of the musical icons of the city. Paris became a major centre for jazz and still attracts jazz musicians from all around the world to its clubs and cafés.[258] Paris is the spiritual home of gypsy jazz in particular, and many of the Parisian jazzmen who developed in the first half of the 20th century began by playing Bal-musette in the city.[257] Django Reinhardt rose to fame in Paris, having moved to the 18th arrondissement in a caravan as a young boy, and performed with violinist Stéphane Grappelli and their Quintette du Hot Club de France in the 1930s and 1940s.[259] Immediately after the War the Saint-Germain-des-Pres quarter and the nearby Saint-Michel quarter became home to many small jazz clubs, mostly found in cellars because of a lack of space; these included the Caveau des Lorientais, the Club Saint-Germain, the Rose Rouge, the Vieux-Colombier, and the most famous, Le Tabou. They introduced Parisians to the music of Claude Luter, Boris Vian, Sydney Bechet, Mezz Mezzrow, and Henri Salvador. Most of the clubs closed by the early 1960s, as musical tastes shifted toward rock and roll.[260] Some of the finest manouche musicians in the world are found here playing the cafés of the city at night.[259] Some of the more notable jazz venues include the New Morning, Le Sunset, La Chope des Puces and Bouquet du Nord.[258][259] Several yearly festivals take place in Paris, including the Paris Jazz Festival and the rock festival Rock en Seine.[261] The Orchestre de Paris was established in 1967.[262] On 19 December 2015, Paris and other worldwide fans commemorated the 100th anniversary of the birth of Edith Piaf—a cabaret singer-songwriter and actress who became widely regarded as France's national chanteuse, as well as being one of France's greatest international stars.[263] Other singers—of similar style—include Maurice Chevalier, Charles Aznavour, Yves Montand, as well as Charles Trenet. Paris has a big hip hop scene. This music became popular during the 1980s.[264] The presence of a large African and Caribbean community helped to its development, it gave a voice, a political and social status for many minorities.[265] Cinema[edit] See also: List of films set in Paris The movie industry was born in Paris when Auguste and Louis Lumière projected the first motion picture for a paying audience at the Grand Café on 28 December 1895.[266] Many of Paris' concert/dance halls were transformed into cinemas when the media became popular beginning in the 1930s. Later, most of the largest cinemas were divided into multiple, smaller rooms. Paris' largest cinema room today is in the Grand Rex theatre with 2,700 seats.[267]Big multiplex cinemas have been built since the 1990s. UGC Ciné Cité Les Halles with 27 screens, MK2 Bibliothèque with 20 screens and UGC Ciné Cité Bercy with 18 screens are among the largest.[268] Parisians tend to share the same movie-going trends as many of the world's global cities, with cinemas primarily dominated by Hollywood-generated film entertainment. French cinema comes a close second, with major directors (réalisateurs) such as Claude Lelouch, Jean-Luc Godard, and Luc Besson, and the more slapstick/popular genre with director Claude Zidi as an example. European and Asian films are also widely shown and appreciated.[269] On 2 February 2000, Philippe Binant realised the first digital cinema projection in Europe, with the DLP CINEMA technology developed by Texas Instruments, in Paris.[270][271] Restaurants and cuisine[edit] See also: French cuisine Dining room of the Vagenende Le Zimmer, on the Place du Châtelet, where Géo Lefèvre first suggested the idea of a Tour de France to Henri Desgrange in 1902 Since the late 18th century, Paris has been famous for its restaurants and haute cuisine, food meticulously prepared and artfully presented. A luxury restaurant, La Taverne Anglaise, opened in 1786 in the arcades of the Palais-Royal by Antoine Beauvilliers; it featured an elegant dining room, an extensive menu, linen tablecloths, a large wine list and well-trained waiters; it became a model for future Paris restaurants. The restaurant Le Grand Véfour in the Palais-Royal dates from the same period.[272] The famous Paris restaurants of the 19th century, including the Café de Paris, the Rocher de Cancale, the Café Anglais, Maison Dorée and the Café Riche, were mostly located near the theatres on the Boulevard des Italiens; they were immortalised in the novels of Balzac and Émile Zola. Several of the best-known restaurants in Paris today appeared during the Belle Époque, including Maxim's on Rue Royale, Ledoyen in the gardens of the Champs-Élysées, and the Tour d'Argent on the Quai de la Tournelle.[273] Today, due to Paris' cosmopolitan population, every French regional cuisine and almost every national cuisine in the world can be found there; the city has more than 9,000 restaurants.[274] The Michelin Guide has been a standard guide to French restaurants since 1900, awarding its highest award, three stars, to the best restaurants in France. In 2018, of the 27 Michelin three-star restaurants in France, ten are located in Paris. These include both restaurants which serve classical French cuisine, such as L'Ambroisie in the Place des Vosges, and those which serve non-traditional menus, such as L'Astrance, which combines French and Asian cuisines. Several of France's most famous chefs, including Pierre Gagnaire, Alain Ducasse, Yannick Alléno and Alain Passard, have three-star restaurants in Paris.[275][276] Les Deux Magots café on Boulevard Saint-Germain In addition to the classical restaurants, Paris has several other kinds of traditional eating places. The café arrived in Paris in the 17th century, when the beverage was first brought from Turkey, and by the 18th century Parisian cafés were centres of the city's political and cultural life. The Café Procope on the Left Bank dates from this period. In the 20th century, the cafés of the Left Bank, especially Café de la Rotonde and Le Dôme Café in Montparnasse and Café de Flore and Les Deux Magots on Boulevard Saint Germain, all still in business, were important meeting places for painters, writers and philosophers.[273] A bistro is a type of eating place loosely defined as a neighbourhood restaurant with a modest decor and prices and a regular clientele and a congenial atmosphere. Its name is said to have come in 1814 from the Russian soldiers who occupied the city; ""bistro"" means ""quickly"" in Russian, and they wanted their meals served rapidly so they could get back their encampment. Real bistros are increasingly rare in Paris, due to rising costs, competition from cheaper ethnic restaurants, and different eating habits of Parisian diners.[277] A brasserie originally was a tavern located next to a brewery, which served beer and food at any hour. Beginning with the Paris Exposition of 1867; it became a popular kind of restaurant which featured beer and other beverages served by young women in the national costume associated with the beverage, particular German costumes for beer. Now brasseries, like cafés, serve food and drinks throughout the day.[278] Fashion[edit] Main article: French fashion Magdalena Frackowiak at Paris Fashion Week (Fall 2011) Since the 19th century, Paris has been an international fashion capital, particularly in the domain of haute couture (clothing hand-made to order for private clients).[279] It is home to some of the largest fashion houses in the world, including Dior and Chanel, as well as many other well-known and more contemporary fashion designers, such as Karl Lagerfeld, Jean-Paul Gaultier, Yves Saint Laurent, Givenchy, and Christian Lacroix. Paris Fashion Week, held in January and July in the Carrousel du Louvre among other renowned city locations, is one of the top four events on the international fashion calendar. The other fashion capitals of the world, Milan, London, and New York also host fashion weeks.[280][281] Moreover, Paris is also the home of the world's largest cosmetics company: L'Oréal as well as three of the top five global makers of luxury fashion accessories: Louis Vuitton, Hermés, and Cartier.[282] Most of the major fashion designers have their showrooms along the Avenue Montaigne, between the Champs-Élysées and the Seine. Holidays and festivals[edit] Republican Guards parading on Bastille Day Bastille Day, a celebration of the storming of the Bastille in 1789, the biggest festival in the city, is a military parade taking place every year on 14 July on the Champs-Élysées, from the Arc de Triomphe to Place de la Concorde. It includes a flypast over the Champs Élysées by the Patrouille de France, a parade of military units and equipment, and a display of fireworks in the evening, the most spectacular being the one at the Eiffel Tower.[283] Some other yearly festivals are Paris-Plages, a festive event that lasts from mid-July to mid-August when the Right Bank of the Seine is converted into a temporary beach with sand, deck chairs and palm trees;[283] Journées du Patrimoine, Fête de la Musique, Techno Parade, Nuit Blanche, Cinéma au clair de lune, Printemps des rues, Festival d'automne, and Fête des jardins. The Carnaval de Paris, one of the oldest festivals in Paris, dates back to the Middle Ages. Education[edit] Main article: Education in Paris The main building of the former University of Paris is now used by classes from Sorbonne University, New Sorbonne University and other autonomous campuses. Paris is the département with the highest proportion of highly educated people. In 2009, around 40 percent of Parisians held a licence-level diploma or higher, the highest proportion in France,[284] while 13 percent have no diploma, the third-lowest percentage in France. Education in Paris and the Île-de-France region employs approximately 330,000 people, 170,000 of whom are teachers and professors teaching approximately 2.9 million children and students in around 9,000 primary, secondary, and higher education schools and institutions.[285] The University of Paris, founded in the 12th century, is often called the Sorbonne after one of its original medieval colleges. It was broken up into thirteen autonomous universities in 1970, following the student demonstrations in 1968. Most of the campuses today are in the Latin Quarter where the old university was located, while others are scattered around the city and the suburbs.[286] The École des hautes études en sciences sociales (EHESS), France's most prestigious university in the social sciences, is headquartered in the 6th arrondissement. The Paris region hosts France's highest concentration of the grandes écoles – 55 specialised centres of higher-education outside or inside the public university structure. The prestigious public universities are usually considered grands établissements. Most of the grandes écoles were relocated to the suburbs of Paris in the 1960s and 1970s, in new campuses much larger than the old campuses within the crowded City of Paris, though the École Normale Supérieure, PSL University has remained on rue d'Ulm in the 5th arrondissement.[287] There are a high number of engineering schools, led by the PSL University (which comprises several colleges such as École des Mines, École nationale supérieure de chimie, École Pratique des Hautes Études and Paris-Dauphine), the Paris-Saclay University (which comprises several colleges such as AgroParisTech, CentraleSupélec and ENS Paris-Saclay) the Polytechnic Institute of Paris (which comprises several colleges such as École Polytechnique, Télécom Paris and École nationale de la statistique et de l'administration économique) and also independent colleges such as École des Ponts et Chaussées or Arts et Métiers. There are also many business schools, including HEC, INSEAD, ESSEC, and ESCP Europe. The administrative school such as ENA has been relocated to Strasbourg, the political science school Sciences-Po is still located in Paris' 7th arrondissement, the most prestigious university for social sciences, the École des hautes études en sciences sociales is located in Paris' 6th arrondissement and the most prestigious university of economics and finance, Paris-Dauphine, is located in Paris' 16th. The Parisian school of journalism CELSA department of Sorbonne University is located in Neuilly-sur-Seine.[288] Paris is also home to several of France's most famous high-schools such as Lycée Louis-le-Grand, Lycée Henri-IV, Lycée Janson de Sailly and Lycée Condorcet. The National Institute of Sport and Physical Education, located in the 12th arrondissement, is both a physical education institute and high-level training centre for elite athletes. Libraries[edit] Main article: Libraries in Paris Sainte-Geneviève Library The Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF) operates public libraries in Paris, among them the François Mitterrand Library, Richelieu Library, Louvois, Opéra Library, and Arsenal Library.[289] There are three public libraries in the 4th arrondissement. The Forney Library, in the Marais district, is dedicated to the decorative arts; the Arsenal Library occupies a former military building, and has a large collection on French literature; and the Bibliothèque historique de la ville de Paris, also in Le Marais, contains the Paris historical research service. The Sainte-Geneviève Library is in 5th arrondissement; designed by Henri Labrouste and built in the mid-1800s, it contains a rare book and manuscript division.[290] Bibliothèque Mazarine, in the 6th arrondissement, is the oldest public library in France. The Médiathèque Musicale Mahler in the 8th arrondissement opened in 1986 and contains collections related to music. The François Mitterrand Library (nicknamed Très Grande Bibliothèque) in the 13th arrondissement was completed in 1994 to a design of Dominique Perrault and contains four glass towers.[290] There are several academic libraries and archives in Paris. The Sorbonne Library in the 5th arrondissement is the largest university library in Paris. In addition to the Sorbonne location, there are branches in Malesherbes, Clignancourt-Championnet, Michelet-Institut d'Art et d'Archéologie, Serpente-Maison de la Recherche, and Institut des Etudes Ibériques.[291] Other academic libraries include Interuniversity Pharmaceutical Library, Leonardo da Vinci University Library, Paris School of Mines Library, and the René Descartes University Library.[292] Sports[edit] Parc des Princes. Paris' most popular sport clubs are the association football club Paris Saint-Germain F.C. and the rugby union clubs Stade Français and Racing 92, the last of which is based just outside the city proper. The 80,000-seat Stade de France, built for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, is located just north of Paris in the commune of Saint-Denis.[293] It is used for football, rugby union and track and field athletics. It hosts the French national football team for friendlies and major tournaments qualifiers, annually hosts the French national rugby team's home matches of the Six Nations Championship, and hosts several important matches of the Stade Français rugby team.[293] In addition to Paris Saint-Germain F.C., the city has a number of other professional and amateur football clubs: Paris FC, Red Star, RCF Paris and Stade Français Paris. 2010 Tour de France, Champs Élysées. Paris hosted the 1900 and 1924 Summer Olympics and will host the 2024 Summer Olympics and Paralympic Games. The city also hosted the finals of the 1938 FIFA World Cup (at the Stade Olympique de Colombes), as well as the 1998 FIFA World Cup and the 2007 Rugby World Cup Final (both at the Stade de France). Two UEFA Champions League Finals in the current century have also been played in the Stade de France: the 2000 and 2006 editions.[294] Paris has most recently been the host for UEFA Euro 2016, both at the Parc des Princes in the city proper and also at Stade de France, with the latter hosting the opening match and final. The final stage of the most famous bicycle racing in the world, Tour de France, always finishes in Paris. Since 1975, the race has finished on the Champs-Elysées.[295] Tennis is another popular sport in Paris and throughout France; the French Open, held every year on the red clay of the Roland Garros National Tennis Centre,[296] is one of the four Grand Slam events of the world professional tennis tour. The 17,000-seat Bercy Arena (officially named AccorHotels Arena and formerly known as the Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy) is the venue for the annual Paris Masters ATP Tour tennis tournament and has been a frequent site of national and international tournaments in basketball, boxing, cycling, handball, ice hockey, show jumping and other sports. The Bercy Arena also hosted the 2017 IIHF World Ice Hockey Championship, together with Cologne, Germany. The final stages of the FIBA EuroBasket 1951 and EuroBasket 1999 were also played in Paris, the latter at the Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy. The basketball team Levallois Metropolitans plays some of its games at the 4,000 capacity Stade Pierre de Coubertin.[297] Another top-level professional team, Nanterre 92, plays in Nanterre. Infrastructure[edit] Transport[edit] Main article: Transport in Paris See also: List of railway stations in Paris The Gare du Nord railway station is the busiest in Europe. Paris is a major rail, highway, and air transport hub. Île-de-France Mobilités (IDFM), formerly the Syndicat des transports d'Île-de-France (STIF) and before that the Syndicat des transports parisiens (STP), oversees the transit network in the region.[298] The syndicate coordinates public transport and contracts it out to the RATP (operating 347 bus lines, the Métro, eight tramway lines, and sections of the RER), the SNCF (operating suburban rails, one tramway line and the other sections of the RER) and the Optile consortium of private operators managing 1,176 bus lines.[299] Bike lanes are being doubled, while electric car incentives are being created. The French capital is banning the most polluting automobiles from key districts.[300][301] Railways[edit] See also: List of railway stations in Paris A central hub of the national rail network, Paris' six major railway stations (Gare du Nord, Gare de l'Est, Gare de Lyon, Gare d'Austerlitz, Gare Montparnasse, Gare Saint-Lazare) and a minor one (Gare de Bercy) are connected to three networks: the TGV serving four high-speed rail lines, the normal speed Corail trains, and the suburban rails (Transilien). Métro, RER and tramway[edit] Main article: Paris Métro The Paris Métro is the busiest subway network in the European Union. Since the inauguration of its first line in 1900, Paris's Métro network has grown to become the city's most widely used local transport system; today it carries about 5.23 million passengers daily[302] through 16 lines, 303 stations (385 stops) and 220 km (136.7 mi) of rails. Superimposed on this is a 'regional express network', the RER, whose five lines (A, B, C, D, and E), 257 stops and 587 km (365 mi) of rails connect Paris to more distant parts of the urban area.[303] Over €26.5 billion will be invested over the next 15 years to extend the Métro network into the suburbs,[303] with notably the Grand Paris Express project. In addition, the Paris region is served by a light rail network of nine lines, the tramway: Line T1 runs from Asnières-Gennevilliers to Noisy-le-Sec, Line T2 runs from Pont de Bezons to Porte de Versailles, Line T3a runs from Pont du Garigliano to Porte de Vincennes, Line T3b runs from Porte de Vincennes to Porte d'Asnières, Line T5 runs from Saint-Denis to Garges-Sarcelles, Line T6 runs from Châtillon to Viroflay, Line T7 runs from Villejuif to Athis-Mons, Line T8 runs from Saint-Denis to Épinay-sur-Seine and Villetaneuse, all of which are operated by the RATP Group,[304] and line T4 runs from Bondy RER to Aulnay-sous-Bois, which is operated by the state rail carrier SNCF.[303] Five new light rail lines are currently in various stages of development.[305] Air[edit] In 2020 Paris–Charles de Gaulle Airport was the busiest airport in Europe and the eighth-busiest airport in the world.[306] Busiest destinations from Parisairports (CDG, ORY, BVA) in 2014 Domestic destinations Passengers Toulouse 3,158,331 Nice 2,865,602 Bordeaux 1,539,478 Marseille 1,502,196 Pointe-à-Pitre 1,191,437 Saint-Denis (Réunion) 1,108,964 Fort-de-France 1,055,770 Other domestic destinations Montpellier 807,482 Biarritz 684,578 Lyon 613,395 International destinations Passengers Italy 7,881,497 Spain 7,193,481 United States 6,495,677 Germany 4,685,313 United Kingdom 4,177,519 Morocco 3,148,479 Portugal 3,018,446 Algeria 2,351,402 China 2,141,527 Other international destinations Switzerland 1,727,169 Paris is a major international air transport hub with the 5th busiest airport system in the world. The city is served by three commercial international airports: Paris–Charles de Gaulle, Paris–Orly and Beauvais–Tillé Airport. Together these three airports recorded traffic of 96.5 million passengers in 2014.[307] There is also one general aviation airport, Paris-Le Bourget, historically the oldest Parisian airport and closest to the city centre, which is now used only for private business flights and air shows. Orly Airport, located in the southern suburbs of Paris, replaced Le Bourget as the principal airport of Paris from the 1950s to the 1980s.[308] Charles de Gaulle Airport, located on the edge of the northern suburbs of Paris, opened to commercial traffic in 1974 and became the busiest Parisian airport in 1993.[309] For the year 2017 it was the 5th busiest airport in the world by international traffic and it is the hub for the nation's flag carrier Air France.[303] Beauvais-Tillé Airport, located 69 kilometres (43 miles) north of Paris' city centre, is used by charter airlines and low-cost carriers such as Ryanair. Domestically, air travel between Paris and some of France's largest cities such as Lyon, Marseille, or Strasbourg has been in a large measure replaced by high-speed rail due to the opening of several high-speed TGV rail lines from the 1980s. For example, after the LGV Méditerranée opened in 2001, air traffic between Paris and Marseille declined from 2,976,793 passengers in 2000 to 1,502,196 passengers in 2014.[310] After the LGV Est opened in 2007, air traffic between Paris and Strasbourg declined from 1,006,327 passengers in 2006 to 157,207 passengers in 2014.[310] Internationally, air traffic has increased markedly in recent years between Paris and the Gulf airports, the emerging nations of Africa, Russia, Turkey, Portugal, Italy, and mainland China, whereas noticeable decline has been recorded between Paris and the British Isles, Egypt, Tunisia, and Japan.[311][312] Motorways[edit] Ring roads of Paris The city is also the most important hub of France's motorway network, and is surrounded by three orbital freeways: the Périphérique,[105] which follows the approximate path of 19th-century fortifications around Paris, the A86 motorway in the inner suburbs, and finally the Francilienne motorway in the outer suburbs. Paris has an extensive road network with over 2,000 km (1,243 mi) of highways and motorways. Waterways[edit] The Paris region is the most active water transport area in France, with most of the cargo handled by Ports of Paris in facilities located around Paris. The rivers Loire, Rhine, Rhône, Meuse, and Scheldt can be reached by canals connecting with the Seine, which include the Canal Saint-Martin, Canal Saint-Denis, and the Canal de l'Ourcq.[313] Cycling[edit] Vélib' at the Place de la Bastille There are 440 km (270 mi) of cycle paths and routes in Paris. These include piste cyclable (bike lanes separated from other traffic by physical barriers such as a kerb) and bande cyclable (a bicycle lane denoted by a painted path on the road). Some 29 km (18 mi) of specially marked bus lanes are free to be used by cyclists, with a protective barrier protecting against encroachments from vehicles.[314] Cyclists have also been given the right to ride in both directions on certain one-way streets. Paris offers a bike sharing system called Vélib' with more than 20,000 public bicycles distributed at 1,800 parking stations,[315] which can be rented for short and medium distances including one way trips. Electricity[edit] Electricity is provided to Paris through a peripheral grid fed by multiple sources. As of 2012[update], around 50% of electricity generated in the Île-de-France comes from cogeneration energy plants located near the outer limits of the region; other energy sources include the Nogent Nuclear Power Plant (35%), trash incineration (9% – with cogeneration plants, these provide the city in heat as well), methane gas (5%), hydraulics (1%), solar power (0.1%) and a negligible amount of wind power (0.034 GWh).[316] A quarter of the city's district heating is to come from a plant in Saint-Ouen-sur-Seine, burning a 50/50-mix of coal and 140,000 tonnes of wood pellets from the United States per year.[317] Water and sanitation[edit] A view of the Seine, the Île de la Cité and a Bateau Mouche Paris in its early history had only the rivers Seine and Bièvre for water. From 1809, the Canal de l'Ourcq provided Paris with water from less-polluted rivers to the north-east of the capital.[318] From 1857, the civil engineer Eugène Belgrand, under Napoleon III, oversaw the construction of a series of new aqueducts that brought water from locations all around the city to several reservoirs built atop the Capital's highest points of elevation.[319] From then on, the new reservoir system became Paris' principal source of drinking water, and the remains of the old system, pumped into lower levels of the same reservoirs, were from then on used for the cleaning of Paris' streets. This system is still a major part of Paris' modern water-supply network. Today Paris has more than 2,400 km (1,491 mi) of underground passageways[320] dedicated to the evacuation of Paris' liquid wastes. In 1982, Mayor Chirac introduced the motorcycle-mounted Motocrotte to remove dog faeces from Paris streets.[321] The project was abandoned in 2002 for a new and better enforced local law, under the terms of which dog owners can be fined up to €500 for not removing their dog faeces.[322] The air pollution in Paris, from the point of view of particulate matter (PM10), is the highest in France with 38 μg/m3.[323] Parks and gardens[edit] Main articles: List of parks and gardens in Paris and History of Parks and Gardens of Paris The lawns of the Parc des Buttes-Chaumont on a sunny day The Passerelle de l'Avre, crossing the Seine and establishing a link between the Bois de Boulogne and Saint-Cloud in Hauts-de-Seine, is the City of Paris's westernmost point. Paris today has more than 421 municipal parks and gardens, covering more than 3,000 hectares and containing more than 250,000 trees.[324] Two of Paris's oldest and most famous gardens are the Tuileries Garden (created in 1564 for the Tuileries Palace and redone by André Le Nôtre between 1664 and 1672)[325] and the Luxembourg Garden, for the Luxembourg Palace, built for Marie de' Medici in 1612, which today houses the Senate.[326] The Jardin des plantes was the first botanical garden in Paris, created in 1626 by Louis XIII's doctor Guy de La Brosse for the cultivation of medicinal plants.[327] Between 1853 and 1870, Emperor Napoleon III and the city's first director of parks and gardens, Jean-Charles Adolphe Alphand, created the Bois de Boulogne, Bois de Vincennes, Parc Montsouris and Parc des Buttes-Chaumont, located at the four points of the compass around the city, as well as many smaller parks, squares and gardens in the Paris's quarters.[328] Since 1977, the city has created 166 new parks, most notably the Parc de la Villette (1987), Parc André Citroën (1992), Parc de Bercy (1997) and Parc Clichy-Batignolles (2007).[329] One of the newest parks, the Promenade des Berges de la Seine (2013), built on a former highway on the left bank of the Seine between the Pont de l'Alma and the Musée d'Orsay, has floating gardens and gives a view of the city's landmarks. Weekly Parkruns take place in the Bois de Boulogne and the Parc Montsouris [330][331] Cemeteries[edit] The Paris Catacombs hold the remains of approximately 6 million people. During the Roman era, the city's main cemetery was located to the outskirts of the left bank settlement, but this changed with the rise of Catholic Christianity, where most every inner-city church had adjoining burial grounds for use by their parishes. With Paris's growth many of these, particularly the city's largest cemetery, the Holy Innocents' Cemetery, were filled to overflowing, creating quite unsanitary conditions for the capital. When inner-city burials were condemned from 1786, the contents of all Paris' parish cemeteries were transferred to a renovated section of Paris's stone mines outside the ""Porte d'Enfer"" city gate, today place Denfert-Rochereau in the 14th arrondissement.[332][333] The process of moving bones from the Cimetière des Innocents to the catacombs took place between 1786 and 1814;[334] part of the network of tunnels and remains can be visited today on the official tour of the catacombs. After a tentative creation of several smaller suburban cemeteries, the Prefect Nicholas Frochot under Napoleon Bonaparte provided a more definitive solution in the creation of three massive Parisian cemeteries outside the city limits.[335] Open from 1804, these were the cemeteries of Père Lachaise, Montmartre, Montparnasse, and later Passy; these cemeteries became inner-city once again when Paris annexed all neighbouring communes to the inside of its much larger ring of suburban fortifications in 1860. New suburban cemeteries were created in the early 20th century: The largest of these are the Cimetière parisien de Saint-Ouen, the Cimetière parisien de Pantin (also known as Cimetière parisien de Pantin-Bobigny), the Cimetière parisien d'Ivry, and the Cimetière parisien de Bagneux.[336] Some of the most famous people in the world are buried in Parisian cemeteries, such as Oscar Wilde, Frederic Chopin, Jim Morrison, Édith Piaf and Serge Gainsbourg among others.[337] Healthcare[edit] The Hôtel-Dieu de Paris, the oldest hospital in the city Health care and emergency medical service in the City of Paris and its suburbs are provided by the Assistance publique – Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP), a public hospital system that employs more than 90,000 people (including practitioners, support personnel, and administrators) in 44 hospitals.[338] It is the largest hospital system in Europe. It provides health care, teaching, research, prevention, education and emergency medical service in 52 branches of medicine. The hospitals receive more than 5.8 million annual patient visits.[338] One of the most notable hospitals is the Hôtel-Dieu, founded in 651, the oldest hospital in the city,[339] although the current building is the product of a reconstruction of 1877. Other hospitals include Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital (one of the largest in Europe), Hôpital Cochin, Bichat–Claude Bernard Hospital, Hôpital Européen Georges-Pompidou, Bicêtre Hospital, Beaujon Hospital, the Curie Institute, Lariboisière Hospital, Necker–Enfants Malades Hospital, Hôpital Saint-Louis, Hôpital de la Charité and the American Hospital of Paris. Media[edit] Agence France-Presse Headquarters in Paris Paris and its close suburbs is home to numerous newspapers, magazines and publications including Le Monde, Le Figaro, Libération, Le Nouvel Observateur, Le Canard enchaîné, La Croix, Pariscope, Le Parisien (in Saint-Ouen), Les Échos, Paris Match (Neuilly-sur-Seine), Réseaux & Télécoms, Reuters France, and L'Officiel des Spectacles.[340] France's two most prestigious newspapers, Le Monde and Le Figaro, are the centrepieces of the Parisian publishing industry.[341] Agence France-Presse is France's oldest, and one of the world's oldest, continually operating news agencies. AFP, as it is colloquially abbreviated, maintains its headquarters in Paris, as it has since 1835.[342] France 24 is a television news channel owned and operated by the French government, and is based in Paris.[343] Another news agency is France Diplomatie, owned and operated by the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs, and pertains solely to diplomatic news and occurrences.[344] The most-viewed network in France, TF1, is in nearby Boulogne-Billancourt. France 2, France 3, Canal+, France 5, M6 (Neuilly-sur-Seine), Arte, D8, W9, NT1, NRJ 12, La Chaîne parlementaire, France 4, BFM TV, and Gulli are other stations located in and around the capital.[345] Radio France, France's public radio broadcaster, and its various channels, is headquartered in Paris' 16th arrondissement. Radio France Internationale, another public broadcaster is also based in the city.[346] Paris also holds the headquarters of the La Poste, France's national postal carrier.[347] International relations[edit] Twin towns and sister cities[edit] Column dedicated to Paris near the Baths of Diocletian in Rome Sculpture dedicated to Rome in the square Paul Painlevé in Paris See also: List of twin towns and sister cities in France Since 9 April 1956, Paris is exclusively and reciprocally twinned only with:[348][349] Rome, Italy, 1956 Seule Paris est digne de Rome ; seule Rome est digne de Paris.

Évry (French pronunciation: [evʁi] (listen)) is a former commune in the southern suburbs of Paris, France, prefecture of the department of Essonne. On 1 January 2019, it was merged into the new commune Évry-Courcouronnes.[2] It is located 25.0 km (15.5 mi) from the center of Paris, in the ""new town"" of Évry Ville Nouvelle, created in the 1960s, of which it is the central and most populated commune. Significant nearby communes include Courcouronnes, Corbeil-Essonnes, Ris-Orangis, Brétigny-sur-Orge, and Draveil.

The name ""Évry"" comes from the Gallic name Eburacon or Eburiacos, meaning ""land of Eburos"" (a Gallic patronym), perhaps the leader of a Gallic tribe in the area before the conquest of Gaul by the Romans. After the conquest, the name was corrupted into Latin Apriacum, then Medieval Latin Avriacum, and later Evriacum. In 1881 the name of the commune was changed into Évry-Petit-Bourg at the request of entrepreneur Paul Decauville, owner of Ateliers de Petit-Bourg, a large boiler works located in Évry and at the time the largest employer in the area. The factory owed its name to the hamlet of Petit-Bourg (one of the three hamlets on the territory of Évry) where it was built. On 29 June 1965 the name of the commune was shortened into ""Évry"" only. Évry had just been chosen to become a ""new town"" of the suburbs of Paris, destined to host tens of thousands of suburbanites, and so the name ""Petit-Bourg"" (literally meaning ""little borough, small town"" in modern French, although etymologists think that this name was in fact the corruption of an old Gallic word with a totally different meaning) was deemed too old fashioned and improper for the new large suburban city of Évry to be built. History[edit] In 1965 Évry became part of the French new town initiative and took its current name. Before then it was known as ""Évry-Petit-Bourg"" and had a population of only a few thousand.[3] When Évry was built, Orly was the primary international airport of France, and many international companies such as Digital, Hewlett-Packard, and Alstom established their head offices in Évry. However, with the expansion of Charles de Gaulle Roissy airport, all the larger companies have moved out, causing the downfall of the many smaller service companies which catered to the lunchtime needs of the thousands of staff who were either displaced or made redundant. Amongst the few international companies remaining are the hotel and catering firm of Accor and the supermarket chain of Carrefour. Although both have a postal Cedex address in Évry, geographically they are in Courcouronnes. The town has tried to counteract this exodus by increasing the capacity of the commercial center, the Agora, to 235 shops, mostly selling the same wares (54 ready-made women's wear, 14 shoe shops, 28 men's wear, 13 children's wear, 15 jewellers, 9 mobile phone shops, 9 opticians, and 19 restaurants and snack bars). The economy of the Agora has also been hit by the recession. A total of 29 shops and one restaurant are vacant. 24 are on the upper level where the rents are almost double that of the lower level shops. During the week the car parks are now ""pay by the hour"" to discourage rail commuters from saturating the parking space during the day to the detriment of shoppers. Weekend parking is free. Another measure taken by the local authorities has been to declare certain quarters a ""zone franche"" which means that businesses starting up in these areas are exempt from corporation tax along with many other social benefits and aids which makes Évry an attractive town for future entrepreneurs. The Cathedral of the Resurrection, dedicated to Saint Corbinien, is one of the few 20th century cathedrals built in a truly modern style (see also Coventry Cathedral Basil Spence 1962, Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral Frederick Gibberd 1967). The total cost was 13.72M€. The total surface is 1,600 m2, and it is 34m high. It can receive 1,400 people. Pope John Paul II made a visit on 22 August 1997, and although car parks were requisitioned as far away as Corbeil-Essonnes, apart from invited guests, fewer than 500 people turned out for the event, which means that Évry may hold the world record for the smallest crowd at a papal appearance.[citation needed] In 2003, the Socialist mayor, Manuel Valls (born 13 August 1962, in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, French nationality by naturalisation in 1982), and who is also the constituency deputé (Member of Parliament) and a qualified avocat (barrister), embarked upon a massive safeguard plan designed to entirely renovate the more defavourised areas which includes much demolition of the obsolete 1960s buildings (especially in the ""Pyramides"" quarter, once the French equivalent of the Gorbals), and the upgrading of the more recent residential structures and schools. 2006 saw the final renovation of the Collège des Pyramides at the cost of 11.43M€ (the price of a new school) and will receive 571 pupils. In 2007, enlargement and renovation was to begin on the Lycée des Loges. The work was to last three years without interruption of lessons, and the budget was set at 40M€. Demolition of several buildings in the Jules Vallès quarter of the Pyramides is in progress. They will be replaced by ""low level"" blocks of appartements. At the same time, the university residence is being renovated along with the construction of a ""mall"" which will eventually link the northern limit of the town with the town centre in preparation for when the tramway will provide a direct transport to Paris as an alternative to the RER railway. On 31 January 2006, in the Sénat during the 14th ceremony of the ""Prix du Trombinoscope 2005"" (press awards), Manuel Valls was elected ""Local Representative of the Year"". With the heavy defeat of the Socialists on the national scale during the 2007 elections, Manuel Valls has taken a prominent position in the party and has been given the nickname of ""Le Sarko de la gauche"" (the left wing Sarkozy). During the 2008 municipal elections, Manuel Valls was returned to office as mayor on the first round with 70.3% of the vote, which gave him the highest national score for a first-round ballot, making Evry the safest Socialist commune in France. During his first national presentation as a presidential candidate during the Socialist primary elections of 9 October 2011, Manuel Valls won 5.63% of the vote. The 3 June 2012 saw an exceptional reunion of the town council where Manuel Valls resigned as mayor after being nominated as Minister of the Interior in the new Socialist government. Amongst the personalities present were Jacques Guyard, former mayor, Jean-Pierre Caffet, senator, and Lionel Jospin, former prime minister. The first adjoint, Francis Chouat, became the new mayor. The place of first adjoint is now held by Pacôme Adjourouvi who was born and grew up in the defavourised Pyramides sector and is now an avocat at the tribunal of Evry.

(November 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Rue des Mazières Évry is demographically the second youngest town in France, with the average age of the population only 26 years. (Recently beaten by Mulhouse with an average age of 24 years.) On 9 September 2011, 7,000 children began a new academic year in the town's 42 schools with eight supplementary classes added. Over 3,300 meals are served daily in the school canteens, and the town has spent €10 million on education. Not including teaching staff, 350 auxiliaries are employed looking after the 3- to 11-year-old children, along with seven staff specialised in sport. At the other end of the age span, Évry has only three residences for the elderly, and the cemetery, proportionally small compared to towns with similar a population figure, is closed to further inhumations. Burials are now carried out at the Garenne cemetery in nearby Courcouronnes where a crematorium has also recently been built. Five paediatricians are established in Évry along with paediatric units in the hospital and in the two private clinics, whereas no funeral parlours or morticians exist in the town of Évry. Immigration[edit] This section needs to be updated. Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (September 2015) Place of birth of residents of Évry in 1999 Born in metropolitan France Born outside metropolitan France 74.7% 25.3% Born inoverseas France Born in foreign countries with French citizenship at birth1 EU-15 immigrants2 Non-EU-15 immigrants 4.0% 3.4% 2.4% 15.5% 1 This group is made up largely of former French settlers, such as Pieds-Noirs in Northwest Africa, followed by former colonial citizens who had French citizenship at birth (such as was often the case for the native elite in French colonies), as well as to a lesser extent foreign-born children of French expatriates. Note that a foreign country is understood as a country not part of France in 1999, so a person born for example in 1950 in Algeria, when Algeria was an integral part of France, is nonetheless listed as a person born in a foreign country in French statistics. 2 An immigrant is a person born in a foreign country not having French citizenship at birth. Note that an immigrant may have acquired French citizenship since moving to France, but is still considered an immigrant in French statistics. On the other hand, persons born in France with foreign citizenship (the children of immigrants) are not listed as immigrants. Administration[edit] Préfecture building of the Essonne department in Évry Évry is the préfecture (capital) of the Essonne département. It is also the official seat of the arrondissement of Évry, although in reality the sous-préfecture buildings and administration are located in the neighboring commune of Corbeil-Essonnes. Évry is the seat of the canton of Évry, which consists of the commune of Évry-Courcouronnes.[4] Transport[edit] Evry – Courcouronnes Station The regional rapid transit RER line D forks just south of Évry into two branches, encircling Évry and the commune of Ris-Orangis before merging into one right-of-way again 11 kilometres (6.8 mi) north of the fork. Évry is served by three stations along the two branches: Évry-Val-de-Seine, Évry – Courcouronnes Centre, and Le Bras-de-Fer. The line that serves the station Évry – Courcouronnes Centre and Le Bras-de-Fer was built at the same time as the new town. The town is bordered to the west by the A6 motorway, south by the National 104, and the National 7 running north to south divides the town in two. The Seine marks the eastern limit of the town. A new port has recently been built to accommodate an increase in barge traffic. The local bus network is served by Tice operator, including lines 401, 402, 403 and 453, 404, 405, 407, 408, 414, 414D and 415. By night, Noctilien can be taken from Evry to Villeneuve-Saint-Georges station with line N135 and to Paris-Est station with line N144. Both stations are also deserved by the RER. Economy[edit] Accor and Arianespace have their former headquarters and headquarters, respectively, in Courcouronnes,[5][6] near Évry.[7][8] Carrefour's Hypermarket division has its head office in Courcouronnes, near Évry.[9] Education[edit] As of 2016[update] the commune has 42 schools with 7,200 students.[10] The commune has six junior high schools:[11] Collège des Pyramides Collège Galilée Collège Le Village Collège Montesquieu Collège Paul Éluard Senior high schools:[11] Lycée Auguste Perret Lycée Charles Baudelaire Lycée du Parc des Loges Lycée François Truffaut is in nearby Bondoufle, Lycée Pierre Mendès France is in nearby Ris-Orangis, Lycée Georges Brassens is in nearby Courcouronnes, and Lycée Robert Doisneau is in nearby Corbeil-Essonnes.[11] Private schools[11] Collège-Lycée Notre-Dame-De-Sion University: University of Évry Val d'Essonne Grande école: École nationale supérieure d'informatique pour l'industrie et l'entreprise Telecom Business School Telecom SudParis Religion[edit] Évry has the following religious edifices (in descending order of attendance): Grand Mosque of Évry and Islamic Centre (largest in France). picture Cathedral of the Resurrection Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons) Evangelist Centre (Protestant) Adventist Church[12] Parish church of St Peter & St Paul (extremely rare 12th century building oriented north–south instead of east/west)[13] Synagogue Notre Dame de l'Esperance[14] Convent of Notre Dame de Sion There is also a very strong presence of Jehovah's Witnesses in Évry, with a new Kingdom Hall on the Route Nationale 7 nearly opposite the pagoda. The Grand Mosque of Évry with its 5,525 m2 is one of the largest in Europe, and is of Moroccan architecture. The minaret is 25m tall. It has a large prayer room and can accommodate a total of 5.000 people. Évry is a ""multicultural"" community, yet problems rarely arise. The construction of the mosque was mostly funded by King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and the interior decoration by the Moroccan king Hassan II. The total cost was €6.8 million. Although the true story of the kidnapping and death of Ben Barka is still a mystery, many people believe he is buried either under the mosque or in the nearby forest of La Garenne.[citation needed] The Pagoda Khanh-Anh will be the largest Buddhist temple in Europe (3,287 m2) and will accommodate 1,500 people. The initial cost was estimated at €7.6 million, mostly funded by the Vietnamese community, but is expected to have doubled by the end of the construction. Work began in 1996 and is yet to be completed. The statue of Buddha, 4 metres tall and weighing 5 tons, arrived from Thailand on 20 October 2002. The pagoda will be the headquarters of the European Buddhist Congregation and will be a training school for future monks and nuns. The Dalai Lama consecrated the edifice on 12 August 2008. He made a speech in English which was translated by interpreters into French and Vietnamese. 1,500 adepts were admitted into the grounds coming from as far away as Canada, but only 500 visitors watched the ceremony on a giant screen erected in the nearby park.[15] Political activity[edit] The following political parties have a permanent base in Évry: Parti Communiste Français Parti Radical de Gauche Parti Socialiste UDF UMP Groupe des Verts Groupe ""Défi pour Évry"" Groupe ""Nous, Citoyens d'Évry"" Miscellaneous[edit] The composer Gioachino Rossini had a country residence in Évry to be near his friend Edmond de Goncourt, who lived on the opposite bank of the Seine in Draveil. It was here that he wrote the greater part of his opera The Barber of Seville. On 16 November 1943, Resistance fighter Missak Manouchian was arrested during a gun battle on the banks of the Seine, a few hundred yards from Évry railway station after his group had been outnumbered. A memorial marks the exact place where he was arrested. Towards the end of the war, General Patton crossed the Seine with his tanks at Évry en route from Avranches going towards the east. The anniversary of the liberation of Évry on 23 August 1944, is celebrated annually at the Patton Memorial. Although Évry is a modern ""new town"", which is generally synonymous with ""concrete jungle"", 50% of its surface area is parkland and open space. The main thoroughfares are very wide avenues, and trees are to be found everywhere. In the nationwide intercommunal competition ""Ville Fleurie"" (flowered town) Évry has been awarded the high status of ""3 flowers"", usually won by country villages. To encourage this aspect of the town an annual ""Balcon Fleuri"" (flowered balcony) competition is held. A similar balcony competition is held each December for the best exterior Christmas decorations. Some people consider the modern cathedral as an architectural beauty while others liken the design to that of a blast furnace.[citation needed] Évry is the home of the European space project Ariane, at the Centre National d'Études Spatiales (CNES). Notable personalities[edit] Maud Medenou, basketball player Aurélien Ngeyitala, footballer Niska, rapper Koba LaD, rapper Kodès, rapper Bolemvn, rapper Twinnings[edit] Évry is twinned with the London Borough of Bexley in England. This is because, originally, Évry was designed to be a predominantly management and executive class town. Évry is also twinned with Nowy Targ in Poland, Troisdorf in Germany, Estelí in Nicaragua, and Repentigny in Quebec, Canada. The Agglomération d'Évry has twinning pacts with Kayes in Mali and Khan Younis in the Gaza Strip. (Maison du Monde, 509, Patio des Terrasses, Évry, sharing the address with a branch of Amnesty International.) The latest addition to the overseas contacts is a ""parrainage"" (godfather) pact with Bozovici in Romania. Sports[edit] The Peaux rouges of Évry (in blue) Several évryens clubs illustrated in various disciplines such as AS Evry in football (soccer) who played in the third division national league and the Paris Île-de-France, the Corsairs of Evry in American football. evolving into a second division championship and sometimes national French elite; the Peaux Rouges in ice hockey who play in the third national division, and the North South Viry Evry Essonne athletics. The town regularly hosts national meetings such as the French Dance Federation in 1981. Being city-stage of the Tour de France in 2001, it was also bid to host the Grand Prix of France. In June 2012, the French Rugby Federation (FFR) announced that the now-closed Ris-Orangis horse racing track in Évry had been chosen as the site for a proposed new stadium for the national rugby union team. The new ground was intended to feature 82,000 seats, a retractable roof, and a slide-out pitch, and was to be at the center of a 133-hectare shopping and entertainment complex. Plans originally called for the stadium to open in 2017,[16] but FFR abandoned the project in December 2016 after numerous delays.[17] See also[edit] France portal University of Évry Val d'Essonne Telecom SudParis Telecom Business School References[edit] ^ Téléchargement du fichier d'ensemble des populations légales en 2017, INSEE ^ ""Arrêté préfectoral de l'Essonne, 12 Octobre 2018"" (PDF). pp. 83–86.

A geographic coordinate system (GCS) is a coordinate system associated with positions on Earth (geographic position). A GCS can give positions: as spherical coordinate system using latitude, longitude, and elevation;[1] as map coordinates projected onto the plane, possibly including elevation;[1] as earth-centered, earth-fixed (ECEF) Cartesian coordinates in 3-space; as a set of numbers, letters or symbols forming a geocode. In geodetic coordinates and map coordinates, the coordinate tuple is decomposed such that one of the numbers represents a vertical position and two of the numbers represent a horizontal position.[2] Contents 1 History 2 Geodetic datum 3 Horizontal coordinates 3.1 Latitude and longitude 3.1.1 Length of a degree 3.2 Grid coordinates 3.2.1 UTM and UPS systems 3.2.2 Stereographic coordinate system 4 Vertical coordinates 5 3D Cartesian coordinates 5.1 Earth-centered, Earth-fixed 5.2 Local tangent plane 6 See also 7 Notes 8 References 8.1 Citations 8.2 Sources 9 External links History[edit] Main articles: History of geodesy, history of longitude, and history of prime meridians The invention of a geographic coordinate system is generally credited to Eratosthenes of Cyrene, who composed his now-lost Geography at the Library of Alexandria in the 3rd century BC.[3] A century later, Hipparchus of Nicaea improved on this system by determining latitude from stellar measurements rather than solar altitude and determining longitude by timings of lunar eclipses, rather than dead reckoning. In the 1st or 2nd century, Marinus of Tyre compiled an extensive gazetteer and mathematically-plotted world map using coordinates measured east from a prime meridian at the westernmost known land, designated the Fortunate Isles, off the coast of western Africa around the Canary or Cape Verde Islands, and measured north or south of the island of Rhodes off Asia Minor. Ptolemy credited him with the full adoption of longitude and latitude, rather than measuring latitude in terms of the length of the midsummer day.[4] Ptolemy's 2nd-century Geography used the same prime meridian but measured latitude from the Equator instead. After their work was translated into Arabic in the 9th century, Al-Khwārizmī's Book of the Description of the Earth corrected Marinus' and Ptolemy's errors regarding the length of the Mediterranean Sea,[note 1] causing medieval Arabic cartography to use a prime meridian around 10° east of Ptolemy's line. Mathematical cartography resumed in Europe following Maximus Planudes' recovery of Ptolemy's text a little before 1300; the text was translated into Latin at Florence by Jacobus Angelus around 1407. In 1884, the United States hosted the International Meridian Conference, attended by representatives from twenty-five nations. Twenty-two of them agreed to adopt the longitude of the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, England as the zero-reference line. The Dominican Republic voted against the motion, while France and Brazil abstained.[5] France adopted Greenwich Mean Time in place of local determinations by the Paris Observatory in 1911. Geodetic datum[edit] Main article: Geodetic datum Further information: Figure of the Earth, Reference ellipsoid, Geographic coordinate conversion, and Spatial reference system In order to be unambiguous about the direction of ""vertical"" and the ""horizontal"" surface above which they are measuring, map-makers choose a reference ellipsoid with a given origin and orientation that best fits their need for the area to be mapped. They then choose the most appropriate mapping of the spherical coordinate system onto that ellipsoid, called a terrestrial reference system or geodetic datum. Datums may be global, meaning that they represent the whole Earth, or they may be local, meaning that they represent an ellipsoid best-fit to only a portion of the Earth. Points on the Earth's surface move relative to each other due to continental plate motion, subsidence, and diurnal Earth tidal movement caused by the Moon and the Sun. This daily movement can be as much as a meter. Continental movement can be up to 10 cm a year, or 10 m in a century. A weather system high-pressure area can cause a sinking of 5 mm. Scandinavia is rising by 1 cm a year as a result of the melting of the ice sheets of the last ice age, but neighboring Scotland is rising by only 0.2 cm. These changes are insignificant if a local datum is used, but are statistically significant if a global datum is used.[1] Examples of global datums include World Geodetic System (WGS 84, also known as EPSG:4326[6]), the default datum used for the Global Positioning System,[note 2] and the International Terrestrial Reference System and Frame (ITRF), used for estimating continental drift and crustal deformation.[7] The distance to Earth's center can be used both for very deep positions and for positions in space.[1] Local datums chosen by a national cartographical organization include the North American Datum, the European ED50, and the British OSGB36. Given a location, the datum provides the latitude ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } and longitude λ {\displaystyle \lambda } . In the United Kingdom there are three common latitude, longitude, and height systems in use. WGS 84 differs at Greenwich from the one used on published maps OSGB36 by approximately 112 m. The military system ED50, used by NATO, differs from about 120 m to 180 m.[1] The latitude and longitude on a map made against a local datum may not be the same as one obtained from a GPS receiver. Converting coordinates from one datum to another requires a datum transformation such as a Helmert transformation, although in certain situations a simple translation may be sufficient.[8] In popular GIS software, data projected in latitude/longitude is often represented as a Geographic Coordinate System. For example, data in latitude/longitude if the datum is the North American Datum of 1983 is denoted by 'GCS North American 1983'. Horizontal coordinates[edit] Main article: Horizontal position Latitude and longitude[edit] 0° Equator, the 0° parallel of latitude Main articles: Latitude and Longitude The ""latitude"" (abbreviation: Lat., φ, or phi) of a point on Earth's surface is the angle between the equatorial plane and the straight line that passes through that point and through (or close to) the center of the Earth.[note 3] Lines joining points of the same latitude trace circles on the surface of Earth called parallels, as they are parallel to the Equator and to each other. The North Pole is 90° N; the South Pole is 90° S. The 0° parallel of latitude is designated the Equator, the fundamental plane of all geographic coordinate systems. The Equator divides the globe into Northern and Southern Hemispheres. 0° Prime Meridian, the 0° of longitude The ""longitude"" (abbreviation: Long., λ, or lambda) of a point on Earth's surface is the angle east or west of a reference meridian to another meridian that passes through that point. All meridians are halves of great ellipses (often called great circles), which converge at the North and South Poles. The meridian of the British Royal Observatory in Greenwich, in southeast London, England, is the international prime meridian, although some organizations—such as the French Institut national de l'information géographique et forestière—continue to use other meridians for internal purposes. The prime meridian determines the proper Eastern and Western Hemispheres, although maps often divide these hemispheres further west in order to keep the Old World on a single side. The antipodal meridian of Greenwich is both 180°W and 180°E. This is not to be conflated with the International Date Line, which diverges from it in several places for political and convenience reasons, including between far eastern Russia and the far western Aleutian Islands. The combination of these two components specifies the position of any location on the surface of Earth, without consideration of altitude or depth. The grid formed by lines of latitude and longitude is known as a ""graticule"".[9] The origin/zero point of this system is located in the Gulf of Guinea about 625 km (390 mi) south of Tema, Ghana.

(May 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) On the GRS80 or WGS84 spheroid at sea level at the Equator, one latitudinal second measures 30.715 meters, one latitudinal minute is 1843 meters and one latitudinal degree is 110.6 kilometers. The circles of longitude, meridians, meet at the geographical poles, with the west–east width of a second naturally decreasing as latitude increases. On the Equator at sea level, one longitudinal second measures 30.92 meters, a longitudinal minute is 1855 meters and a longitudinal degree is 111.3 kilometers. At 30° a longitudinal second is 26.76 meters, at Greenwich (51°28′38″N) 19.22 meters, and at 60° it is 15.42 meters. On the WGS84 spheroid, the length in meters of a degree of latitude at latitude φ (that is, the number of meters you would have to travel along a north–south line to move 1 degree in latitude, when at latitude φ), is about 111132.92 − 559.82 cos ⁡ 2 φ + 1.175 cos ⁡ 4 φ − 0.0023 cos ⁡ 6 φ {\displaystyle 111132.92-559.82\,\cos 2\varphi +1.175\,\cos 4\varphi -0.0023\,\cos 6\varphi } [10] The returned measure of meters per degree latitude varies continuously with latitude. Similarly, the length in meters of a degree of longitude can be calculated as 111412.84 cos ⁡ φ − 93.5 cos ⁡ 3 φ + 0.118 cos ⁡ 5 φ {\displaystyle 111412.84\,\cos \varphi -93.5\,\cos 3\varphi +0.118\,\cos 5\varphi } [10] (Those coefficients can be improved, but as they stand the distance they give is correct within a centimeter.) The formulae both return units of meters per degree. An alternative method to estimate the length of a longitudinal degree at latitude φ {\displaystyle \textstyle {\varphi }\,\!} is to assume a spherical Earth (to get the width per minute and second, divide by 60 and 3600, respectively): π 180 M r cos ⁡ φ {\displaystyle {\frac {\pi }{180}}M_{r}\cos \varphi \!} where Earth's average meridional radius M r {\displaystyle \textstyle {M_{r}}\,\!} is 6,367,449 m. Since the Earth is an oblate spheroid, not spherical, that result can be off by several tenths of a percent; a better approximation of a longitudinal degree at latitude φ {\displaystyle \textstyle {\varphi }\,\!} is π 180 a cos ⁡ β {\displaystyle {\frac {\pi }{180}}a\cos \beta \,\!} where Earth's equatorial radius a {\displaystyle a} equals 6,378,137 m and tan ⁡ β = b a tan ⁡ φ {\displaystyle \textstyle {\tan \beta ={\frac {b}{a}}\tan \varphi }\,\!} ; for the GRS80 and WGS84 spheroids, b/a calculates to be 0.99664719. ( β {\displaystyle \textstyle {\beta }\,\!} is known as the reduced (or parametric) latitude). Aside from rounding, this is the exact distance along a parallel of latitude; getting the distance along the shortest route will be more work, but those two distances are always within 0.6 meter of each other if the two points are one degree of longitude apart.

The datum, along with a map projection applied to a grid of reference locations, establishes a grid system for plotting locations. Common map projections in current use include the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM), the Military Grid Reference System (MGRS), the United States National Grid (USNG), the Global Area Reference System (GARS) and the World Geographic Reference System (GEOREF).[11] Coordinates on a map are usually in terms northing N and easting E offsets relative to a specified origin. Map projection formulas depend on the geometry of the projection as well as parameters dependent on the particular location at which the map is projected. The set of parameters can vary based on the type of project and the conventions chosen for the projection. For the transverse Mercator projection used in UTM, the parameters associated are the latitude and longitude of the natural origin, the false northing and false easting, and an overall scale factor.[12] Given the parameters associated with particular location or grin, the projection formulas for the transverse Mercator are a complex mix of algebraic and trigonometric functions.[12]:45-54 UTM and UPS systems[edit] Main articles: Universal Transverse Mercator and Universal Polar Stereographic The Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) and Universal Polar Stereographic (UPS) coordinate systems both use a metric-based Cartesian grid laid out on a conformally projected surface to locate positions on the surface of the Earth. The UTM system is not a single map projection but a series of sixty, each covering 6-degree bands of longitude. The UPS system is used for the polar regions, which are not covered by the UTM system. Stereographic coordinate system[edit] Further information: Stereographic projection During medieval times, the stereographic coordinate system was used for navigation purposes.[citation needed] The stereographic coordinate system was superseded by the latitude-longitude system. Although no longer used in navigation, the stereographic coordinate system is still used in modern times to describe crystallographic orientations in the fields of crystallography, mineralogy and materials science.[citation needed] Vertical coordinates[edit] Main article: Vertical position This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (December 2018) Vertical coordinates include height and depth. 3D Cartesian coordinates[edit] Further information: Axes conventions Every point that is expressed in ellipsoidal coordinates can be expressed as an rectilinear x y z (Cartesian) coordinate. Cartesian coordinates simplify many mathematical calculations. The Cartesian systems of different datums are not equivalent.[2] Earth-centered, Earth-fixed[edit] Earth centered, Earth fixed coordinates in relation to latitude and longitude. Main article: ECEF The Earth-centered Earth-fixed (also known as the ECEF, ECF, or conventional terrestrial coordinate system) rotates with the Earth and has its origin at the center of the Earth. The conventional right-handed coordinate system puts: The origin at the center of mass of the Earth, a point close to the Earth's center of figure The Z axis on the line between the North and South Poles, with positive values increasing northward (but does not exactly coincide with the Earth's rotational axis)[13] The X and Y axes in the plane of the Equator The X axis passing through extending from 180 degrees longitude at the Equator (negative) to 0 degrees longitude (prime meridian) at the Equator (positive) The Y axis passing through extending from 90 degrees west longitude at the Equator (negative) to 90 degrees east longitude at the Equator (positive) An example is the NGS data for a brass disk near Donner Summit, in California. Given the dimensions of the ellipsoid, the conversion from lat/lon/height-above-ellipsoid coordinates to X-Y-Z is straightforward—calculate the X-Y-Z for the given lat-lon on the surface of the ellipsoid and add the X-Y-Z vector that is perpendicular to the ellipsoid there and has length equal to the point's height above the ellipsoid. The reverse conversion is harder: given X-Y-Z we can immediately get longitude, but no closed formula for latitude and height exists. See ""Geodetic system."" Using Bowring's formula in 1976 Survey Review the first iteration gives latitude correct within 10-11 degree as long as the point is within 10,000 meters above or 5,000 meters below the ellipsoid. Local tangent plane[edit] Earth centered Earth fixed and East, North, up coordinates. Main article: Local tangent plane Further information: Geographic coordinate conversion § From ECEF to ENU A local tangent plane can be defined based on the vertical and horizontal dimensions. The vertical coordinate can point either up or down. There are two kinds of conventions for the frames: East, North, up (ENU), used in geography North, East, down (NED), used specially in aerospace In many targeting and tracking applications the local ENU Cartesian coordinate system is far more intuitive and practical than ECEF or geodetic coordinates. The local ENU coordinates are formed from a plane tangent to the Earth's surface fixed to a specific location and hence it is sometimes known as a local tangent or local geodetic plane. By convention the east axis is labeled x {\displaystyle x} , the north y {\displaystyle y} and the up z {\displaystyle z} . In an airplane, most objects of interest are below the aircraft, so it is sensible to define down as a positive number. The NED coordinates allow this as an alternative to the ENU. By convention, the north axis is labeled x ′ {\displaystyle x'} , the east y ′ {\displaystyle y'} and the down z ′ {\displaystyle z'} . To avoid confusion between x {\displaystyle x} and x ′ {\displaystyle x'} , etc. in this article we will restrict the local coordinate frame to ENU.

Read more Earth sciences and environment Towards a new constitutive law for the bolt-grout interface Theoretical and experimental study of fully grouted rockbolts and cablebolts under axial loads In the thesis of Laura Blanco Martin, the bolt-grout interface of fully grouted rockbolts has been studied with the aim of determining its constitutive law. For this purpose, axial loadings acting on the bar have been considered and theoretical and experimental research conducted. The theoretical investigations link the response of the surrounding materials (bolt, grout and ground) to that of the interface, which is not directly accessible. Pull-out tests have been carried out to obtain experimental information. Combining the theoretical developments with the test results, the interface variables can be determined. This procedure proves that, in order to study the bolt-grout interface accurately, the behaviour of the surrounding materials should be well known. From the available data, a semi-empirical formulation of the interface response is proposed. The tangential behaviour suggests that friction is not the only component to the shear stress. The normal response, which is more difficult to ascertain, depends on the bolt profile.

The work was full time conducted in the R&D department of VINCI Construction France. After a motivating six-month internship at the CEP and engineering school graduation, Maxime Trocmé was desirous to acquire more competence on building eco-design. This doctoral thesis was a way to fulfil this wish in a theoretical (building models) and practical way (real building studies). Since it took place within the framework of a CIFRE convention, it was also an opportunity to gain professional experience.

PSA Peugeot Citroën initiated research works to design the assembling process using metallic screwing/threading on polymers. It consists in directly taping the polymeric piece during the mounting operation by using self-threading metallic screw. The final objective of the work of Jonathan Ricard deals with the ability to numerically (finite element) model the screwing/threading operation. This numerical tool offers the possibility to perform a large campaign of study highlighting the sensitivity of the assembly procedure to a significant range of parameters.

This was achieved through the use of his own large collections of minerals, and a chair in mineralogy was established on July 11, 1778. The school of mines was begun at the mint, the Hôtel de la Monnaie, Paris. The school was officially opened by decree of the French King's Counsel on March 19, 1783.[2] The school disappeared at the beginning of the French Revolution but was re-established by decree of the Committee of Public Safety in 1794, the 13th Messidor Year II. It moved to Savoie, after a decree of the consuls the 23rd Pluviôse Year X (1802). After the Bourbon Restoration in 1814, the school moved to the Hôtel de Vendôme (in the 6th arrondissement in Paris' Jardin du Luxembourg). From the 1960s onwards, it created research laboratories in Fontainebleau, Évry, and Sophia Antipolis (Nice). Education[edit] The Hôtel de Vendôme, central building of Mines ParisTech The initial aim of the École des mines de Paris, namely to train high-level mining engineers, evolved with time to adapt to the technological and structural transformations undergone by society. Mines ParisTech has now become one of the most prestigious French engineering schools with a broad variety of subjects. Its students are trained to have management positions, work in research and development departments, or as operations officers, etc. They receive a well-rounded education in a variety of subjects, ranging from the most technical (Mathematics, Physics) to economics, social sciences or even art in order to be able to tackle the managing or engineering-related issues they are to face. Exchange programs are possible during the third semester with prestigious universities around the world, such as Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), California Institute of Technology (Caltech), University of Hong Kong, National University of Singapore (NUS), Tokyo Tech, Seoul National University... Degrees[edit] Mines ParisTech provides different educational paths: The Ingénieurs civils degree (Master of Science and Executive Engineering), ranked among the best French grandes écoles engineering degrees, similar to that offered at École polytechnique, École des Ponts ParisTech and CentraleSupélec. The Corps of Mines, one of the greatest technical corps of the French state. It is a third cycle degree, lasting for three years, consisting in two long-term internships both in public and private economical institutions and courses in economics and public institutions.[3] The admission to the Corps des Mines is highly selective as only the top students from École polytechnique, École normale supérieure, Mines ParisTech and Telecom Paris may apply.

May 19, 2021 Briefing Session on the COVAX Initiative By videoconference Canadian Section of ParlAmericas (CPAM) On 19 May 2021, the Canadian Section of ParlAmericas received a briefing from the Honourable Karina Gould, PC, MP, Minister of International Development, and officials from Global Affairs Canada (GAC) on the topic of the COVAX Initiative. The GAC officials were Joshua Tabah, Director General, Global Issues and Development, Health and Nutrition, and Karen Mollica, Director, Central America and Caribbean, Strategic Planning, Operations and Policy Division. Attending the briefing from the Senate were the Honourable Senators Robert Black, René Cormier, Julie Miville-Dechêne, and Mobina Jaffer. Participating from the House of Commons were Marc G. Serré MP, Chair of the Canadian Section, Richard Cannings, MP, Julie Dzerowicz, MP, Vice-Chair of the Canadian Section, John McKay, MP and Patrick Weiler, MP. Minister Gould spoke about the Government of Canada’s support to the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT Accelerator) since its establishment in April 2020. She indicated that the ACT Accelerator works to develop vaccines, tests and treatments for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, and to distribute these tools fairly around the world; the section of the ACT Accelerator dedicated to vaccine distribution is known as “COVAX.” According to Minister Gould, along with the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States, Canada is one of the leading donors to the COVAX Initiative. She added that Canada will consider directing excess vaccine doses that it may acquire to the ACT Accelerator in the future but only after Canada is due to receive more vaccine doses than it can use, and the country is “not there yet.” Minister Gould also noted that, in addition to the Government of Canada’s contributions to COVAX, Canada has provided Latin American countries with more than $10 million during the COVID-19 pandemic through various organizations, including the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), with this funding aimed at providing personal protective equipment. GAC officials provided responses to the questions posed by participants. In describing the current status of the COVAX Initiative, Mr. Tabah noted that 12 million World Health Organization–approved vaccine doses have been delivered to more than 100 countries. He underscored that those countries include 31 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, which have a shortage of doses, and commented that some of those countries lack “vaccine confidence,” with some groups and individuals spreading information about the vaccines that is misleading or inaccurate. As well, Mr. Tabah mentioned that one of COVAX’s primary goals is to help end the pandemic’s acute phase by providing every country in the world with fair and equitable access to vaccine doses. He indicated that, because of the complex and thorough process by which doses are allocated, countries are generally confident about the fairness of the process. According to him, COVAX aims to deliver 2 billion doses through the initiative, with all participating countries receiving enough doses to vaccinate 20% of their populations in 2021; the primary focus is health care workers and those most vulnerable to the illness, such as the elderly. He explained that when countries commit to redirect surplus vaccine doses to COVAX, significant advance notice is very helpful because of legal and logistical complexities; for example, once insurance-related and other documents are completed, the vaccine doses must be transported directly from the production facility to the destination country to ensure their security.

(July 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Partnership for Observation of the Global OceanAbbreviationPOGOFormation1999TypeConsortium of major oceanographic institutions around the worldPurposeTo promote global operational oceanographyRegion GlobalMembership 49LeaderProf. Nicholas OWens The Partnership for Observation of the Global Ocean (POGO), which was founded in 1999, is a consortium of major oceanographic institutions around the world, represented by their Directors. POGO's goal is to promote global operational oceanography, the implementation of a Global Ocean Observing System, and the importance of ocean observations for society.[1] In 2020, POGO had 51 Members.[2] The current Chairman (2019-2022) is Prof. Nick Owens (Scottish Association for Marine Science, UK). [3] It is supported from annual dues subscribed by the Members, as well as by grants from charitable foundations. The funds to explore the value of, and then establish, POGO were provided by the Alfred P. Sloan and Richard Lounsbery foundations. POGO provides a forum (at the annual meetings and intersessionally) for Members to meet with their peers, and with senior officials of partner organisations, to discuss issues of mutual concern. As a means to ease the shortage in trained observers of the ocean in developing countries, It has developed a suite of programmes in capacity building, and works with relevant partner organisations in the marine field SCOR, IOC, GOOS, GEO). It engages in outreach activities to the general public, for example by having exhibits at international events such as World Expo (2012), UNFCCC COP Meetings and AGU-ASLO-TOS Ocean Sciences Meetings Expo 2012 Yeosu Korea.[4] Contents 1 History 2 POGO Capacity Building 3 Activities 4 Members 5 Secretariat 6 References 7 External links History[edit] In March 1999, the Directors of Scripps Institution of Oceanography, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and the Southampton Oceanography Centre in the UK, convened a planning meeting in the headquarters of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of the United Nations Education, Science and Culture Organisation (IOC-UNESCO) in Paris. This meeting confirmed the value of creating a new partnership and defined the initial mission statement and terms of reference. Scripps Institution of Oceanography hosted the first formal meeting in early December 1999, which included senior officials from 17 institutions in 12 countries (as well as representatives of the IOC, the Scientific Committee for Oceanic Research (SCOR) of the International Council for Science (ICSU), the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) and several international scientific programs. At this meeting, there was agreement on an initial work plan, including development of an advocacy plan for observing systems; participation in processes to secure governmental commitments to fund ocean observing systems; a data interchange demonstration pilot project; and establishment of a clearinghouse for information exchange among POGO members, as well as the broader community. POGO Capacity Building[edit] The Nippon Foundation - POGO Centre of Excellence in Observational Oceanography (currently hosted by the Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Science), under which ten scientists from developing countries, annually, are supported to study for ten months in an intensive programme related to ocean observations.[5] The POGO-SCOR Visiting Fellowship Programme, for scientists from developing countries to spend up to three months in a major oceanographic institution. The programme is carried out in conjunction with POGO's partner organisation SCOR. The POGO-AMT Fellowship Programme, under which one scientist annually participate sin a major oceanographic cruise (the Atlantic Meridional Transect cruise), and spend time at a participating major oceanographic institute before and after the cruise to experience cruise preparation and data analysis. (2008+). Under POGO capacity-building schemes, some 1000 young scientists from 63 countries have received advanced training. Former scholars or alumni of NF-POGO training become members of the rapidly developing NF-POGO Alumni Network for Oceans (NANO).[6] Activities[edit] In its São Paulo Declaration of 2001, POGO drew attention to the world imbalance between Northern and Southern Hemispheres in the capacity to observe the oceans, resulting in its establishment of a capacity-building programme (above). It also underlined the relative paucity of ocean observations in the Southern Hemisphere compared with the Northern Hemisphere, and POGO member JAMSTEC, organised a circumnavigation of the Southern Hemisphere, the BEAGLE Expedition, using its ship RV Mirai, at a cost estimated to be around $35M.[1] More recently, selected Antarctic Expeditions of the Alfred Wegener Institute have been labelled POGO Expeditions. POGO also supports the Southern Ocean Observing System (SOOS). Around the time POGO was being started, the Argo programme was also beginning. The GEO Secretariat was established during the early years of POGO. Oceans did not appear among the nine societal-benefit areas around which GEO was structured at that time. POGO advocated for a greater prominence of ocean observing activities within GEO, which led the creation of a new Ocean Task (SB01, Oceans and Society: Blue Planet) in the 2012-2015 GEO Work Plan. This was expanded and further developed into what is now known as the GEO Blue Planet Initiative. POGO contributed to OceanObs'09 in Venice in 2009, which led to the opening up of sustained ocean observations to a broader community, including chemical, biological and biogeochemical observations, and also participated in the post-Venice Framework for Ocean Observing Committee. More recently, POGO was involved in the OceanObs'19 conference in Honolulu, USA. POGO member institutions have been driving the establishment of OceanSites (coordinated, deep-ocean, multi-disciplinary time-series reference sites), which has made significant progress in recent years.[1] The idea for an ""International Quiet Ocean Experiment"" first came up during one of the POGO Annual Meetings. With seed funding from the Sloan Foundation, the idea was further developed in partnership with SCOR. An Open Science Meeting was convened under the auspices of SCOR and POGO at IOC-UNESCO, Paris, in August–September 2011, to develop a Science Plan for the project, which could last up to ten years.[7] Members[edit] POGO has 51 member institutions in 27 countries. Secretariat[edit] The Secretariat is hosted by Plymouth Marine Laboratory in the UK, with a satellite office hosted by the University of Algarve in Portugal. References[edit] ^ a b c ""Research"".

Contact Search Search for: Partners / Partners Many actors, working together internationally, are needed to bring about sustainable management of the oceans that is informed by sound science, underpinned by a comprehensive global ocean measurement system. These include: National governments working individually and through intergovernmental structures and bodies – who are agents for political action and international consensus and support the governance framework for international cooperation.Non-governmental organisations aimed at coordinating science, influencing policy and/or raising public awareness at regional and global scales.The wider scientific community, working nationally and internationally – who undertake research, share and synthesise ideas and findings and identify key scientific challenges and develop internationally agreed research agendas.Funders of research and monitoring programmes whether they be governments, businesses or not for profit foundations – who provide the resources needed.Individual citizens working individually and collectively whose support and desire for a better life and world provides continuing motivation and inspiration for all involved. Within this landscape, we as members of POGO individually have distinctive roles and collectively have a unique role. Our aim is to focus on actions based on our unique individual and collective capabilities as described.  It is not our aim to duplicate or replicate work that can or should be done by other organisations with other relevant competencies. We have particularly close and complementary relationships with two bodies providing overarching frameworks for global observations, namely UNESCO’s Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission governed Global Ocean Observing System (IOC-GOOS) and the Group on Earth Observations’ Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEO-GEOSS). We also work closely with a number of non-governmental, international organisations (such as the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research, SCOR) and receive valuable support from foundations (such as the Nippon, Sloan and Lounsbery Foundations). For more information on ocean organisations and how they are connected visit: POGO on Oceanscape.org Partner Organisations GEO (Group on Earth Observations) GEO is a partnership of more than 100 national governments and in excess of 100 Participating Organizations that envisions a future where decisions and actions for the benefit of humankind are informed by coordinated, comprehensive and sustained Earth observations. GEO is a unique global network connecting government institutions, academic and research institutions, data providers, businesses, engineers, scientists and experts to create innovative solutions to global challenges at a time of exponential data growth, human development and climate change that transcend national and disciplinary boundaries. The unprecedented global collaboration of experts helps identify gaps and reduce duplication in the areas of sustainable development and sound environmental management. POGO attended the very first meeting of GEO in Washington DC in 2003, during which it was recognised as a contributing organisation with a unique role to play, particularly with regard to representing in situ ocean observing. Since then POGO has been a Participating Organisation in GEO and instrumental in advocating for the inclusion of the ocean realm within GEO, which led to the creation of GEO Blue Planet. GEO Blue Planet The creation of the “Oceans and Society: Blue Planet” Task was an initiative of the Partnership for Observation of the Global Ocean (POGO) in 2011, to bring together all the existing ocean observation programmes within GEO, to add new ones to the GEO portfolio, and to create synergies between them. This has evolved into the “GEO Blue Planet Initiative”, which has a demonstrated capacity to bridge the gap between data and services to deliver usable information that supports end-users for informed decision-making toward reaching sustainable development of the world’s marine resources. POGO continues to work with and support GEO Blue Planet, particularly through the joint Oceanscape project and through the participation of the POGO CEO in the GEO Blue Planet Steering Committee (as Co-Chair from 2017-2020). GOOS The Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) is a sustained collaborative system of ocean observations, encompassing in situ networks, satellite systems, governments, UN agencies and individual scientists. It is organised around a series of components undertaking requirements assessment, observing implementation, innovation through projects, and a core team. POGO works with and supports IOC/GOOS in advancing global ocean observing through the collective endeavours of its member institutions, which represent most of the world’s ocean observing capacity. POGO’s work is made complementary to that of GOOS by focusing more specifically on innovation, capacity development and outreach/advocacy for ocean observations. Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) UNESCO’s Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) promotes international cooperation and coordinates programmes in marine research, services, observation systems, hazard mitigation, and capacity development in order to understand and effectively manage the resources of the ocean and coastal areas. By applying this knowledge, the Commission aims to improve the governance, management, institutional capacity, and decision-making processes of its Member States with respect to marine resources and climate variability and to foster sustainable development of the marine environment, in particular in developing countries. POGO participates as an Observer at IOC Assemblies, and has collaborated with IOC on a number of programmes, including capacity development and the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development. POGO works particularly closely with the International Ocean Data and Information Exchange (IODE) programme of IOC, for example on the ocean data management module at the NF-POGO Centre of Excellence. SCOR (Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research) The International Council for Science (ICSU) formed the Special Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR) in 1957 to help address interdisciplinary science questions related to the ocean. SCOR was the first interdisciplinary body formed by ICSU. SCOR’s name was later changed to “Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research” to reflect its more permanent status. SCOR activities focus on promoting international cooperation in planning and conducting oceanographic research, and solving methodological and conceptual problems that hinder research. SCOR covers all areas of ocean science and cooperates with other organizations with common interests to conduct many SCOR activities. SCOR also conducts several different activities to build the capacity for ocean science in developing countries and every SCOR activity includes members from developing countries. POGO has always enjoyed good working relations with SCOR and collaborated on many joint programmes, including the POGO-SCOR Visiting Fellowship programme and general assessment of capacity development needs and priorities, as well as the evaluation of joint and respective training programmes. POGO co-sponsors the International Quiet Ocean Experiment, together with SCOR, and supports a number of other SCOR programmes, such as the Southern Ocean Observing System (SOOS) and the Surface Ocean Lower Atmosphere Study (SOLAS) –see below. Sponsors/Foundations The Alfred P Sloan Foundation The Sloan Foundation is a US not-for-profit grant-making institution that supports high quality, impartial scientific research; fosters a robust, diverse scientific workforce; strengthens public understanding and engagement with science; and promotes the health of the institutions of scientific endeavor. Seed funding from the Sloan Foundation was instrumental in getting POGO started, by supporting the first two POGO meetings as well as by funding various workshops, the International Cruise Information Database and a video produced for the GEO Ministerial in 2007. The Nippon Foundation The Nippon Foundation (NF) has been the main sponsor of POGO Capacity Building programmes since 2004.  With the NF-POGO Centre of Excellence, the Ocean Training Partnership (OTP) and the NF-POGO Alumni Network for Oceans (NANO), NF and POGO are investing in young researchers from all over the world by providing a forum for training, networking and exchange. The Richard Lounsbery Foundation The Lounsbery Foundation was founded in 1959, with a goal to enhance US national strengths in science and technology and foster strong French-American cooperation. To this day, the Foundation has stayed true to its roots while expanding to promote science among youth and to support components of US policy issues pertaining to science. The Foundation attained a place in donor history in 2004 by becoming the first philanthropic supporter of Wikipedia. It was also instrumental in providing initial support which enabled POGO to begin life without taxing its members. More recently, the Lounsbery Foundation has provided a 50K USD grant to support POGO’s efforts in biological observations. PROGRAMMES AND PROJECTS SUPPORTED BY POGO Antares POGO helped to fund the meeting at which the Latin-American network of bio-optical oceanographers called Antares was born and led subsequently to the formation of a global-scale analogue, ChloroGIN (see below). POGO continues to collaborate with and provide support to Antares, particularly through its capacity building programmes and the NF-POGO Alumni Network for Oceans. Argo Around the time POGO was being started, the Argo programme was also beginning. One of the first crusades of POGO was to throw the collective weight of its members behind the world expansion of Argo. A collaboration among 50 research and operational agencies from 26 countries, Argo now has charge of more than 3,500 floats around the world’s oceans. Because the members of POGO are directors with the power to commit resources and influence decision makers, a resolution to accord full support to Argo had immediate effect, and the distribution of floats around the world ocean improved rapidly. Argo is now part of the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS). Atlantic Meridional Transect (AMT) AMT is a multidisciplinary scientific programme, hosted by Plymouth Marine Laboratory in collaboration with the National Oceanographic Centre. AMT undertakes biological, chemical and physical oceanographic research during an annual voyage between the UK and the South Atlantic and provides the longest time series of oceanographic observations on an ocean-basin scale. The programme was established in 1995 and has included 21 research cruises involving over 200 scientists from 15 countries. An annual POGO-AMT fellowship is offered to candidates from developing nations to facilitate capacity building through the transfer of first-hand experience and knowledge to the benefit of the global scientific community. ChloroGIN ChloroGIN was created in 2006 during a workshop sponsored by POGO, GOOS, GEO, IOCCG and PML, and was inspired by the Latin American Network Antares. It aims to promote in situ chlorophyll measurements in combination with satellite-derived estimates. ChloroGIN is funded by the Canadian Space Agency, and was included as a Task within the first GEO Work Plan. It later became a component of the new GEO Task SB01 “Oceans and Society: Blue Planet” (now known as the GEO Blue Planet Initiative). GACS The Global Alliance of Continuous Plankton Recorder Surveys was initiated by the Sir Alister Hardy Foundation for Ocean Science (SAHFOS) during a workshop held in Plymouth in September 2011. POGO was invited to attend to provide advice on setting up a new international programme, and to sign as a witness the Memorandum of Understanding. Members of the Alliance currently include Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Japan, New Zealand, South Africa, UK and USA. International Quiet Ocean Experiment (IQOE) Together with SCOR, and with seed funding from the Sloan Foundation, POGO is supporting the development of the International Quiet Ocean Experiment. The IQOE is a programme set to last a decade, aimed at mesuring sound in the ocean and the effects of anthopogenic sound on marine life. The programme will make use of existing ocean observing systems and establish new ones to measure the global ocean soundscape. NF-POGO Alumni Network for Oceans (NANO) NANO (NF-POGO Alumni Network for Oceans) is a global network of former scholars of NF and POGO programmes on capacity building. The network is organised into regional coalitions such as NANO Africa, NANO Latin America, NANO India and NANO South-East Asia. Within the NANO network, NF and POGO promote joint research activities and training and provide a platform for networking and exchange. OceanSITES POGO member institutions have been driving the establishment of OceanSITES, a network of deep-ocean, multi-disciplinary time-series reference sites, measuring many variables and monitoring the full depth of the ocean from the surface down to 5,000 metres. This network comprises about 30 surface and 30 sub-surface arrays. At its 2011 meeting in Seoul, POGO’s directors decided to give immediate priority to increasing support for OceanSITES. They also agreed to encourage all OceanSITES parties to maintain a minimum set of common measurements. OceanSITES moorings are integral to the Global Ocean Observing System, as they complement satellite imagery and Argo float data by adding time and depth, and by expanding what is observed. SMART Subsea Cables SMART Subsea Cables for Observing the Global Ocean: This Joint Task Force sponsored by 3 UN agencies (IOC, ITU, WMO) aims to integrate sensors into the repeaters of future trans-oceanic telecommunications cable systems. Sensors would “piggyback” on the existing power and communications infrastructure, with the potential for global coverage at modest incremental cost. Initial sensors would be temperature, pressure, and acceleration. SOLAS (Surface Ocean – Lower Atmosphere Study) “Linking Ocean-Atmosphere Interactions with Climate and People”. The global and multidisciplinary research project Surface Ocean – Lower Atmosphere Study (SOLAS) was established to provide international science coordination and capacity building. Initiated with a first Open Science Conference in 2000 and formally launched in 2004, SOLAS research aims to understand the key biogeochemical-physical interactions and feedbacks between the ocean and atmosphere. Achievement of this goal is important to understand and quantify the role that ocean-atmosphere interactions play in the regulation of climate and global change. POGO is providing funding towards the 2021 SOLAS summer School. SOOS POGO is a sponsor of the Southern Ocean Observing System, which published its Science Plan and established a Project Office at the Institute of Marine and Antarctic Studies, University of Tasmania, in 2011. The SOOS Data Network is the primary access point for search, discovery, mapping and download of data that has been determined to be of significance to the SOOS. In addition, the Southern Ocean Knowledge and Information wiki (SOKI) aims to provide a source of standardised and validated (peer-reviewed) reference material on Southern Ocean ecosystems and on the research tools used in the region.

Sloan Foundation for the program that would become the Census of Marine Life (CoML), a global effort from 2000 to 2010 to assess and explain the diversity, distribution, and abundance of marine life. Sloan required the studies to address a trio of questions: Should the Census happen? Could it happen? And, would it happen?  Read more… March 1999POGO Exploratory MeetingIn March 1999, the Directors of Scripps Institution of Oceanography, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and the Southampton Oceanography Centre in the U.K., convened a planning meeting in the headquarters of the United Nations Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC). This meeting confirmed the value of creating a new partnership and defined the initial mission statement and terms of reference. MEMBERSHIP: 8 institutions in 6 countries April 1999Memories from Charlie Kennel & Lisa Shaffer– Scripps Institution of Oceanography, USA – Having worked on international collaboration in space-based Earth observations at NASA, Charlie Kennel, upon his arrival at Scripps in 1998, aspired to help create a mechanism for promoting international collaboration in global ocean observations and research. He recruited Lisa Shaffer to Scripps, who had headed the international efforts in earth science at NASA and previously at NOAA. POGO was one of the first things they worked on together. Read more… December 1999POGO-1Scripps hosted the first formal meeting of POGO in early December 1999. This inaugural meeting included senior officials from 17 institutions in 12 countries (Australia, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Korea, Norway, Russia, UK, and US), as well as representatives of the IOC, the Scientific Committee for Oceanic Research (SCOR) of the International Council for Science (ICSU), the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) and several international scientific programs.  Read more… MEMBERSHIP: 13 institutions in 10 countries December 1999Prioritisation of Argo agreed at POGO-1At the time that the Argo programme was just beginning, one of the first priorities of POGO was to throw the collective weight of its members behind the concept and the world expansion of Argo. Because the members of POGO are directors with the power to commit resources and influence decision makers, a resolution to accord full support to Argo had immediate effect, and the distribution of floats around the world ocean improved rapidly. January 2000Census of Marine Life beginsThe concept for the Census of Marine was being developed around the same time as the concept for POGO (see Jesse Ausubel’s recollections). It was envisaged from the outset that “an organization like POGO will be absolutely essential for the success of the Census of Marine Life” in the words of Jesse Ausubel, who was instrumental in the establishment and success of both initiatives. From the outset, POGO had a strong focus on biological observations, and obtained a grant from the Sloan Foundation to organise a workshop in 2002 on biodiversity in South America, jointly with CoML. The aim of the workshop was “to assess what is known and unknown about biodiversity in the oceans around South America”. The workshop was instrumental in organising the South American participation in CoML, for example through the establishment of a South American CoML Steering Committee and the decision to establish a South American node for the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS). POGO and CoML also teamed up in 2007 to produce two videos for the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) Ministerial Summit, once again with funding from the Sloan Foundation. One was on ocean observations for societal benefit, and the other on marine biodiversity observations. To find out more about the beginnings of CoML read this article published in Oceanography by Jesse Ausubel in 1999. January 2000Formation of POGO News & Information GroupDuring the creation of POGO in 1999, the world’s oceanographic leaders envisioned a strong communications component to support the mission of POGO and to keep its audiences informed about POGO’s activities. The News & Information (N&I) group was formed to unify all partner institutions, to promote the need for global ocean observations, and to create communications strategies, programs, and products to support POGO initiatives. The POGO N&I team is comprised of the key communications specialists from POGO member institutions, and serves as every POGO member’s connection to POGO’s global activities. November 2000POGO-2POGO-2 was hosted by Instituto Oceanografico, Universidade de São Paulo, Brazil from 29 November-1 December 2000. The first POGO elections took place, with Charlie Kennel elected as Chair. MEMBERSHIP: 16 institutions in 13 countries January 2001Time-Series WG initiatedEarly on, POGO established a WG focusing on fixed point time-series stations, and on the establishment of a network of open-ocean, fixed-point, time-series observations. This was very much seen as a complement to the Argo programme, and the POGO members agreed to collectively support the network of deep-ocean time-series stations that would later become known as OceanSITES. Bob Weller, who was a member of the Time Series WG, and for many years a representative of OceanSITES within POGO, provides some recollections of his time in POGO and of how POGO helped support international cooperation and the establishment and long-term success of OceanSITES. Read more… March 2001Sponsorship of SEREAD projectScientific Educational Resources and Experience Associated with the Deployment of Argo profiling floats in the South Pacific Ocean (SEREAD) is an educational program and resource that provides regionally relevant and focused ocean science that is built upon Argo data in a format that fits directly into existing curricula of Pacific Island schools. POGO co-sponsored this initiative, together with a number of other organisations, until 2007. Read the original project press release here… April 2001We’re official!POGO was registered as Not-for-Profit Society in Nova Scotia, Canada, in April 2001 April 2001Sao Paulo DeclarationAt the POGO-2 Meeting, much of the discussion focused on the need for improved observations of the oceans in the Southern Hemisphere. Many of the challenges that face mankind today (climate change, collapsing fisheries and rising sea level, to name only a few) are global in scope. Our response to these challenges must be based on knowledge of how the world oceans act as a system. Yet, the oceans remain grossly undersampled, and the Southern Hemisphere much more so than the Northern Hemisphere. The issue cannot be addressed without recognising a geopolitical reality: most of the oceans are in the Southern Hemisphere, and most of the major economies in the Northern Hemisphere. A concerted effort at the global level is needed to solve this problem. A key result of the deliberations at POGO-2 was the São Paulo Declaration, which was adopted unanimously by all the participants at the meeting. June 2001SCOR and POGOby Ed Urban (former SCOR Executive Director) and Patricia Miloslavich (current SCOR Executive Director) The Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR) and Partnership for Observation of the Global Ocean (POGO) have been working together since POGO’s formation. First, the organisations have sent representatives to each other’s annual meetings to help provide input in person. These events helped the organisations learn about the activities and priorities of each other to make cooperation more effective. I attended five POGO annual meetings.  Read more… June 2001POGO-SCOR Fellowships begin2001 was the first year of the POGO-SCOR fellowship programme, with SCOR and IOC This programme is jointly funded by POGO and the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR) and is designed to promote training and capacity building leading towards a global observation scheme for the oceans June 2001POGO Biological Obs workshop (2001)From the onset, POGO focused strongly on the need for improved monitoring of marine life and their interactions with their physical and chemical environment.  To address the lack of a system for sustained, long-term, monitoring of marine biota and biological processes at the global scale, POGO convened a Biology Meeting to explore the requirements of such an observing system, and to recommend step-wise and organised implementation of elements of such a system, through the POGO institutions.

January 2003POGO-4The POGO-4 meeting was hosted by CSIRO in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia, from 22-24 January 2003. One of the outcomes was the agreement that an ocean assessment (similar to IPCC for climate) it needed. 2nd Chair of POGO, Howard Roe, takes over from Charlie Kennel MEMBERSHIP: 24 institutions in 17 countries January 2003I was never a great diary writer…says Howard S.J. Roe, Co-Founder of POGO, POGO member and Chair (2003-2004) “The entry for May 11 1998 says-“lunch 2pm/dinner Director of Scripps”; for 26 September 2011 it reads “Abingdon POGO”. These two entries bookend my involvement with POGO – thirteen exciting, interesting and often frustrating years. “The meeting in 1998 was my first with Charlie Kennel who visited Southampton to discuss the possibility of creating a new organisation for the world’s oceanographic institutions.  Read more… July 20031st GEO Meeting in Washington DCFIRST EARTH OBSERVATION SUMMIT (EOS-I): meeting on 31 July 2003 in Washington, DC, US, high-level representatives of 34 governments adopted a declaration establishing the ad hoc intergovernmental Group on Earth Observations (ad hoc GEO), co-chaired by the European Commission, Japan, South Africa and the US to draft a 10-Year Implementation Plan. POGO recognised as a contributing organisation with a unique role to play, particularly with regard to representing in situ ocean observing. July 2003Douglas Cripe, Senior Scientific Advisor, GEO Secretariat“The Partnership for Observation of the Global Ocean – POGO – has been instrumental in the development and agenda-setting of GEO since its inception. Indeed, as a key Participating Organization (PO) in GEO, POGO has shown leadership in raising awareness of the need for coordination and open access to ocean and marine observations, especially in the absence of a Societal Benefit Area dedicated to ocean observations. POGO has long recognized the power of the integration of multiple types of observation data and knowledge to provide comprehensive information about the world’s oceans. Read more… August 2003Mirai Beagle ExpeditionThe Blue EArth GLobal Expedition (BEAGLE), an international circumpolar cruise in the Southern Hemisphere, was organized by JAMSTEC (Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology) to commemorate the 30th anniversary of its establishment. The expedition took place on board the RV Mirai, one of the largest research vessels in the world. The project was comprised of six legs, each approximately four weeks long, commencing in Brisbane, Australia on 3 August 2003, and ending in Fremantle Australia on 19 February 2004. The cruise was designed to enhance research activities in the Southern Hemisphere, in accordance with the São Paulo Declaration, drawn up at the 2nd meeting of the Partnership for the Observation of the Global Oceans (POGO) held in Brazil in 2000.

November 2004POGO-6POGO-6 was hosted by IFREMER, in Brest, France, from 29 November-1 December 2004 Jan de Leeuw takes over from Howard Roe as Chair of POGO MEMBERSHIP: 25 institutions in 17 countries November 2004Brest CommuniqueAdopted by the Partnership for Observation of the Global Oceans (POGO) at their Sixth Meeting at Brest, France, on November 30, 2004. As GEO was in the process of being formally established, the Communique called for a close working relationship between operational agencies and research communities to be maintained on a continuous basis. It urged that proper scientific and technological expertise, advice and representation be included at the highest level on a permanent basis in the GEO organisational structures as they were being established. November 2004The “POGO-web”by Jan W de Leeuw (POGO member director 2001-2009 and POGO Chair 2005-2006) “As director of the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research (Royal NIOZ) I had the pleasure to attend the annual POGO meetings from 2001 (POGO-2) until 2009 (POGO-10) with one exception and more recently the POGO meetings from 2016 (POGO-17) until 2018 (POGO-19) as the NIOZ representative standing in for the present director Henk Brinkhuis, due to extensive reorganizations of NIOZ and its funding body. Read more… January 20052nd Meeting of AntaresSupported by POGO and IOCCG The Latin-American network of bio-optical oceanographers, called Antares, was founded in July 2003 in a workshop in Mar del Plata (Argentina) held at INIDEP. It was financed by a small grant from IOCCG.  However, the idea was born at a POGO training course in at the University of Concepción (Chile) in November 2002. POGO helped to fund the second workshop, which took place at Margarita just before an IOCCG meeting. Further meetings took place, including Brazil 2006; Plymouth 2006. Antares subsequently led to the formation of a global-scale analogue, ChloroGIN. POGO continues to collaborate with and provide support to Antares, particularly through its capacity building programmes and the NF-POGO Alumni Network for Oceans. December 2005POGO/SCOR Workshop on International Research Cruise Database and WebsiteOn 13 December 2005, a one-day workshop took place at NOAA, with the objective, “To improve access to information on past and future research cruises by establishing a comprehensive and user-friendly database and searchable website with information on cruise tracks, types of observations, chief scientist contact information, metadata (for past cruises), project identifier, and berths available”. Read more… December 2005A ‘Voice for the Ocean’Creation of “Oceans United” as a vehicle for various ocean organisations to speak with a common voice within GEO. During the GEO meeting in Geneva in December 2005, POGO initiated a side meeting of representatives of international organisations which participated in GEO that had an ocean mandate. The goal of the side meeting was to coordinate responses from the ocean community to GEO, to speak with a common voice within GEO, and to share GEO tasks. The response to the idea was very positive, and the group was christened Oceans United by Jan de Leeuw, and it was decided that IOC would be the initial spokesperson for the group within GEO. Oceans United was initiated by POGO, IOC, GOOS, IGOS and JCOMM, but it was recognised that other groups would be invited to participate, to enhance the ocean involvement within GEO.

Both courses provided me excellent opportunities to connect with international researchers and also extend my network to Chile. The course contents were up to date and had a huge impact on my research. I have learned many techniques, and about new, cutting edge findings in ocean biogeochemistry. Among them, the life style of Thioploca spp. large sulfur bacteria – we could see them alive in fresh samples taken just outside the lab, in Conception Bay. The researchers I’ve met supported me later on my career, helping me to apply for grants and design my experiments. Lastly, I have made a lot of friends that I maintain contact until today. I am really grateful to POGO and Austral Summer Institute for these lifetime experiences!” April 2006NF-POGO Visiting Professorships in Sri Lanka and BrazilPhoto from the Visiting Professorship to the National Institute for Space Research (INPE), Brazil. May 2006Beagle Cruise Results publishedInitial results were published in Science (12 May, 2006). In this paper, authored by Heather Bouman and others, the bio-optical properties of the phytoplankton are related to the molecular genetic structure of the populations. The global-scale variations in population structure are accounted for by the global-scale variability in vertical mixing. Reports from selected trainees are available on the Beagle website. July 2006Launch of International Cruise Information DatabaseAs an outcome from the POGO-SCOR workshop held in December 2005, an International Cruise Information Database was launched in 2006, to facilitate coordination and volunteer observations. September 2006First Meeting and establishment of ChloroGIN as a pilot project of GOOS.ChloroGIN was created in 2006 during a workshop sponsored by POGO, GOOS, GEO, IOCCG and PML, and was inspired by the Latin American Network Antares. It aims to promote in situ chlorophyll measurements in combination with satellite-derived estimates. ChloroGIN was funded by the Canadian Space Agency, and was included as a Task within the first GEO Work Plan. It later became a component of the new GEO Task SB01 “Oceans and Society: Blue Planet” (now known as the GEO Blue Planet Initiative).

All institutions have turning points in their history. For marine stations, it is frequently a new building, a new ship, a large multi-year grant. BIOS has achieved all of these over the years, but history books will show that BIOS’ role as hosts of NF-POGO CofE was equally monumental. The opportunity to host 10 young, outstanding, ambitious, intelligent, and talented individuals, and we are talking about individuals with a wide range of skill sets and equally wide range of cultures and native languages, can be, and was, a transformative opportunity for BIOS. The term ‘scholars’ was quickly appended to the group (i.e., CoE Scholars, we called them).

September 2008First POGO-PML Shipboard Training on an AMT CruiseThe Atlantic Meridional Transect (AMT) programme (www.amt-uk.org) began in 1995, utilising the passage of the RRS James Clark Ross through the Atlantic Ocean between the UK and the Falkland Islands (50°N to 52°S, a distance of over 13,500 km) southwards in September and northwards in April each year. The transect crosses a range of ecosystems from sub-polar to tropical, and from eutrophic shelf seas and upwelling systems to oligotrophic mid-ocean gyres. Since 2008, a POGO-PML fellowship has placed a trainee on board the AMT cruise, providing a hands-on, sea-going experience to young scientists from developing countries, and the opportunity to be involved in an internationally renowned scientific programme. This fellowship programme is open to scientists, technicians, postgraduate students (PhD/MSc) and post-doctoral fellows involved in oceanographic work at centres in developing countries and countries with economies in transition. The selected candidate has the opportunity to visit Plymouth Marine Laboratory (PML) for one month prior to the start of the cruise to participate in cruise preparation and planning; to go on the cruise and help make hydrological, bio-optical and ecological observations; and after the cruise to spend one additional month at PML, learning to analyse the results statistically and interpret them.

Karen Wiltshire succeeds John Field as Chair of POGO MEMBERSHIP: 35 institutions in 21 countries April 2015First call for and funding of POGO Working Groups and Member Training InitiativesAt its 15th Annual Meeting (Jan 2014), the POGO members decided that POGO needed a more transparent process for allocating support to new or existing projects that approach POGO for support. It was also agreed that POGO would be more effective in advancing ocean observations if it operated through a number of Working Groups dedicated to specific priority areas identified by the members. These must be directly relevant to POGO’s core mission, i.e. sustained, long-term ocean observing systems and shared use of infrastructure, data and information. At the 16th POGO annual meeting (Jan 2015) it was decided that POGO’s funding for training initiatives would be allocated following a similar process, to ensure that the funding is used more effectively to advance POGO’s core mission. Support has been provided to projects proposed by POGO members, which aim to identify and fill gaps in global ocean observation. A call has been issued to the POGO member institutes annually, to advance ocean observations while at the same time strengthening the ties of the POGO network. May 20152nd GEO Blue Planet Symposium, Cairns, AustraliaThe second Blue Planet symposium for the GEO marine Task SB-01 “Oceans and Society: the Blue Planet” was held in Cairns, Australia from 27 to 29 May 2015.

July 2015IQOE Science Plan publishedAn Open Science Meeting was convened at the IOC headquarters in Paris in 2011 to gather ideas and input from the broader community of scientists, navies, industries and others. A Writing Group was put together to distil the discussions at that meeting into a Science Plan, which was subsequently reviewed and approved by SCOR and POGO, before publication in 2015. This sets out a plan to address the following fundamental questions: How have human activities affected the global ocean soundscape compared with natural changes over geologic time? What are the current levels and distribution of anthropogenic sound in the ocean? What are the trends in anthropogenic sound levels across the global ocean? What are the current effects of anthropogenic sound on important marine animal populations? 5) What are the potential future effects of sound on marine life?

The training cruise involved 23 young scientists and 15 experts from 25 nations, travelling from Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands to Bremerhaven in Germany over four weeks, and was the focus of a major schools outreach project. The training was supported by POGO, The Nippon Foundation, Japan and the Alfred Wegener Institute. June 2019SoNoAT Schools OutreachIn 2019, POGO was involved in a major shipboard outreach initiative conducted during the South-North Atlantic training Transect (SoNoAT). Outreach activities within the SoNoAT included Skype sessions, blog posts and social media interactions. Skype sessions involved thirteen schools in five countries (two in Germany, eight in the UK, one in Ireland, one in Brazil and one in Japan) and a climate conference (Klimakonferenz Wir.Machen.Klima.) in Germany. It is estimated that these audiences included over 250 school children from ages between nine and 18 years old. June 2019Women in Ocean Science for Marine #WorldHeritageThe 2019 World Ocean Day was dedicated to gender and the ocean.  To celebrate the day, a UNESCO project honoured women whose scientific work is enhancing the conservation of the 49 marine sites inscribed on the World Heritage List. In this video, former POGO Chair, Karen Wiltshire, talks about the Wadden Sea, which extends along the coasts of Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands. July 2019100 Centre of Excellence ScholarsIn July 2019 we reached the milestone of 100 scholars trained by the NF-POGO Centre of Excellence. Early career researchers from 42 countries were trained in Observational Oceanography by the NF-POGO CofE at the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences (40 scholars between 2008-2012) and at the Alfred Wegener Institute (60 scholars between 2013-2019). September 2019 OceanObs ’19POGO participation in OceanObs ’19 (Honolulu, USA) – exhibition stand, session co-organiser and co-author of several White Papers September 2019Oceanscape Portal LaunchDuring the OceanObs’19 conference in Hawaii, POGO and GEO Blue Planet launched the Oceanscape Portal, a joint initiative to identify existing and create new partnerships among the ocean observing community. All members of the ocean community are invited to participate by adding new “organisations”, which can include intergovernmental organisations, NGOs, private foundations, programmes/projects, companies, trade associations and others – the idea is to make this as inclusive and as useful as possible. You can find out more about the Oceanscape project, and how to add a new entry in the launch announcement.

(July 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Partnership for Observation of the Global OceanAbbreviationPOGOFormation1999TypeConsortium of major oceanographic institutions around the worldPurposeTo promote global operational oceanographyRegion GlobalMembership 49LeaderProf. Nicholas OWens The Partnership for Observation of the Global Ocean (POGO), which was founded in 1999, is a consortium of major oceanographic institutions around the world, represented by their Directors. POGO's goal is to promote global operational oceanography, the implementation of a Global Ocean Observing System, and the importance of ocean observations for society.[1] In 2020, POGO had 51 Members.[2] The current Chairman (2019-2022) is Prof. Nick Owens (Scottish Association for Marine Science, UK). [3] It is supported from annual dues subscribed by the Members, as well as by grants from charitable foundations. The funds to explore the value of, and then establish, POGO were provided by the Alfred P. Sloan and Richard Lounsbery foundations. POGO provides a forum (at the annual meetings and intersessionally) for Members to meet with their peers, and with senior officials of partner organisations, to discuss issues of mutual concern. As a means to ease the shortage in trained observers of the ocean in developing countries, It has developed a suite of programmes in capacity building, and works with relevant partner organisations in the marine field SCOR, IOC, GOOS, GEO). It engages in outreach activities to the general public, for example by having exhibits at international events such as World Expo (2012), UNFCCC COP Meetings and AGU-ASLO-TOS Ocean Sciences Meetings Expo 2012 Yeosu Korea.[4] Contents 1 History 2 POGO Capacity Building 3 Activities 4 Members 5 Secretariat 6 References 7 External links History[edit] In March 1999, the Directors of Scripps Institution of Oceanography, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and the Southampton Oceanography Centre in the UK, convened a planning meeting in the headquarters of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of the United Nations Education, Science and Culture Organisation (IOC-UNESCO) in Paris. This meeting confirmed the value of creating a new partnership and defined the initial mission statement and terms of reference. Scripps Institution of Oceanography hosted the first formal meeting in early December 1999, which included senior officials from 17 institutions in 12 countries (as well as representatives of the IOC, the Scientific Committee for Oceanic Research (SCOR) of the International Council for Science (ICSU), the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) and several international scientific programs. At this meeting, there was agreement on an initial work plan, including development of an advocacy plan for observing systems; participation in processes to secure governmental commitments to fund ocean observing systems; a data interchange demonstration pilot project; and establishment of a clearinghouse for information exchange among POGO members, as well as the broader community. POGO Capacity Building[edit] The Nippon Foundation - POGO Centre of Excellence in Observational Oceanography (currently hosted by the Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Science), under which ten scientists from developing countries, annually, are supported to study for ten months in an intensive programme related to ocean observations.[5] The POGO-SCOR Visiting Fellowship Programme, for scientists from developing countries to spend up to three months in a major oceanographic institution. The programme is carried out in conjunction with POGO's partner organisation SCOR. The POGO-AMT Fellowship Programme, under which one scientist annually participate sin a major oceanographic cruise (the Atlantic Meridional Transect cruise), and spend time at a participating major oceanographic institute before and after the cruise to experience cruise preparation and data analysis. (2008+). Under POGO capacity-building schemes, some 1000 young scientists from 63 countries have received advanced training. Former scholars or alumni of NF-POGO training become members of the rapidly developing NF-POGO Alumni Network for Oceans (NANO).[6] Activities[edit] In its São Paulo Declaration of 2001, POGO drew attention to the world imbalance between Northern and Southern Hemispheres in the capacity to observe the oceans, resulting in its establishment of a capacity-building programme (above). It also underlined the relative paucity of ocean observations in the Southern Hemisphere compared with the Northern Hemisphere, and POGO member JAMSTEC, organised a circumnavigation of the Southern Hemisphere, the BEAGLE Expedition, using its ship RV Mirai, at a cost estimated to be around $35M.[1] More recently, selected Antarctic Expeditions of the Alfred Wegener Institute have been labelled POGO Expeditions. POGO also supports the Southern Ocean Observing System (SOOS). Around the time POGO was being started, the Argo programme was also beginning. The GEO Secretariat was established during the early years of POGO. Oceans did not appear among the nine societal-benefit areas around which GEO was structured at that time. POGO advocated for a greater prominence of ocean observing activities within GEO, which led the creation of a new Ocean Task (SB01, Oceans and Society: Blue Planet) in the 2012-2015 GEO Work Plan. This was expanded and further developed into what is now known as the GEO Blue Planet Initiative. POGO contributed to OceanObs'09 in Venice in 2009, which led to the opening up of sustained ocean observations to a broader community, including chemical, biological and biogeochemical observations, and also participated in the post-Venice Framework for Ocean Observing Committee. More recently, POGO was involved in the OceanObs'19 conference in Honolulu, USA. POGO member institutions have been driving the establishment of OceanSites (coordinated, deep-ocean, multi-disciplinary time-series reference sites), which has made significant progress in recent years.[1] The idea for an ""International Quiet Ocean Experiment"" first came up during one of the POGO Annual Meetings. With seed funding from the Sloan Foundation, the idea was further developed in partnership with SCOR. An Open Science Meeting was convened under the auspices of SCOR and POGO at IOC-UNESCO, Paris, in August–September 2011, to develop a Science Plan for the project, which could last up to ten years.[7] Members[edit] POGO has 51 member institutions in 27 countries. Secretariat[edit] The Secretariat is hosted by Plymouth Marine Laboratory in the UK, with a satellite office hosted by the University of Algarve in Portugal. References[edit] ^ a b c ""Research"".

Contact Search Search for: Innovation in ocean observing Capacity development Outreach and advocacy Taking the Pulse of the Global Ocean Subscribe to our newsletter Taking the Pulse of the Global Ocean Subscribe to our newsletter As human population is predicted to reach 9 billion by 2050, people are turning with growing urgency to the ocean for answers to the greatest challenges of our age, such as feeding the world’s growing population; providing clean energy to power vibrant economies; increasing resilience to dangers from the sea; and mitigating and adapting to climate change. But people are also looking to the ocean for more – for hope and inspiration.  The ocean is the last unexplored frontier on Earth and holds so much promise and opportunity for the future – provided we manage it wisely. Human activities are having widespread impacts on the ocean such as overfishing and biodiversity loss, the acidification of the ocean as it takes up excess carbon dioxide from fossil fuel burning, or the spread of disintegrating waste plastics throughout the ocean with as yet unknown consequences. This ocean state cannot continue and humanity needs to find ways to manage more effectively our relationship with the ocean, coastal seas and estuaries so future generations can benefit from it as we do. Therefore, we need to be more continuously aware of how and why the ocean is changing – and maybe better predict the impacts of the ocean on people and of people on the ocean.  To this end, making continuous ocean measurements with global coverage is now a pressing priority. We need to do this to manage a safer, more sustainable relationship between people and the ocean – and we cannot manage what we cannot measure! The ocean is too vast, too interconnected and its impacts too widespread for any one nation let alone one organisation to embark on this task alone. One simple message is clear: international cooperation is essential. That is why we, the major ocean research institutions of the world have come together to form the Partnership for Observation of the Global Ocean (POGO). We are not daunted by the task ahead of us – we are excited by it. This is because we believe that collectively we have the capability to succeed, enabled by rapidly advancing technological innovations that we are leading.  We believe that working together there is now a real prospect, over the next decade, of making major strides forward in building the truly global ocean measurement system needed to understand and monitor the ocean for the benefit of all.

It is thirty-four miles south of Melbourne. According to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2010 data, the city had a population of 15,220.[6] Contents 1 History 1.1 Pre-Columbian 1.2 Post-Columbian 2 Demographics 3 Geography 3.1 Climate 4 Economy 4.1 Industry 4.2 Retail 4.3 Tourism 4.3.1 Points of interest 4.3.1.1 Beaches 4.3.1.2 Water recreation in the Indian River Lagoon 4.3.1.3 Resorts 4.3.1.4 Historic Dodgertown 4.3.1.5 National Register of Historic Places 5 Infrastructure 5.1 Transportation 5.1.1 Air 5.1.2 Bus 5.1.3 Rail 6 Education 6.1 Public schools 6.1.1 Charter schools 6.2 Private schools 6.3 Colleges 7 Notable people 8 References 9 External links History[edit] Pre-Columbian[edit] See also: Vero man Parts of a human skeleton were found north of Vero in association with the remains of Pleistocene animals in 1915. The find was controversial, and the view that the human remains dated from much later than the Pleistocene prevailed for many years.[7] In 2006, an image of a mastodon or mammoth carved on a bone was found in vicinity of the Vero man discovery. A scientific forensic examination of the bone found the carving had probably been done in the Pleistocene.[8] Archaeologists from Mercyhurst University, in conjunction with the Old Vero Ice Age Sites Committee (OVIASC), conducted excavations at the Old Vero Man site in Vero Beach in 2014–15.[9] Starting in 2016, archaeologists from Florida Atlantic University joined the Old Vero Man site excavations.[10] Post-Columbian[edit] In 1715, a Spanish treasure fleet wrecked off the coast of Vero. Eleven out of twelve Spanish ships carrying tonnes of silver foundered in a hurricane. The remains of the silver attracted pirates. A group of 300 unemployed English privateers led by Henry Jennings stole about £87,500 in gold and silver in their first acts of piracy. In 1872 Captain Allen W. Estes officially established the first land patent between the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian River Lagoon, after settling in the area in 1870. In 1893 Henry Flagler’s Florida East Coast Railway began operation through the area.[11] The town of Vero was chartered on June 13, 1919.[12][13] Vero was officially renamed ""Vero Beach"" and was switched from being part of St. Lucie County to become the county seat of Indian River County when it was formed in June, 1925.[14] There are many theories on possible origin of the city name, but there's no consensus.[14] During the war year of 1942 the U.S. Navy selected 1,500 acres (6.1 km2) surrounding the Vero Beach Municipal Airport as the site of Fort Pierce Naval Amphibious Training Base, a Naval Air Station. Due to the bombing practices conducted during the WWII, there are many buried explosives and the Army Corps officials have conducted ongoing search & clearing exercises for the potentially dangerous items since 2014.[15][16] In 1951 Barber Bridge was built from mainland to barrier islands. It was later demolished and replaced in 1995 with the Merrill P. Barber Bridge. It is named after Merrill P. Barber who was the mayor of Vero beach in 1947.[17] In 1957 Piper Aircraft began research and development in Vero Beach. In 1961 Piper Aircraft moved administrative and manufacturing operations to Vero after completing building additions.[18] In 1965 the A1A bridge over the Sebastian Inlet connected the two barrier islands.[19][11] In 1979, the 17th Street Bridge was completed, allowing a second point of access from Vero Beach mainland to the barrier islands. Demographics[edit] As of the 2010 census,[4][20] there were 15,220 people, 7,505 households, and 3,946 families residing in the city. There were 10,258 housing units. The racial makeup of the city was 87.5% White, 4.8% Black, 0.30% Native American, 1.8% Asian, 0.00% Pacific Islander, 3.7% from other races, and 1.8% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 10.7% of the population. There were 7,505 households, out of which 16.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 39.2% were married couples living together, 9.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 47.4% were non-families. 19.6% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older, with 4.8% being 85 years and older. The average household size was 2.01 and the average family size was 2.65. In the city the population was spread out, with 14.1% under the age of 16, 84.1% over 18, 4.3% from 15 to 19, 4.9% from 20 to 24, 5.5% from 20 to 25 and 29.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 50.9 years. For every 100 females, there were 92.8 males. The population consists of 51.3% female and 48.7% male.

As of July 2015, Piper employed approximately 750 people. Aside from Piper, the bulk of commercial activity in Vero Beach centers around tourism, the citrus industry and service activities. Retail[edit] There are two shopping malls: the Indian River Mall, and the Vero Beach Outlets just west of I-95 on State Road 60. There are small specialty shops along Ocean Drive on the barrier island. There are also a set of shops directly inland in what is called ""Miracle Mile."" The Historic Downtown is a newly revitalized area of shopping, dining, antique stores, and art galleries. Tourism[edit] Points of interest[edit] Beaches[edit] The beaches in Vero Beach are part of Florida's Treasure Coast. Vero's three main public beaches are South Beach, accessible at the eastern end of Florida State Road 656 at the eastern end of 17th Street; Humiston Park, in Vero's Central Beach Business District on Ocean Drive and Jaycee Park which is adjacent to Conn Beach. There are 26 miles (42 km) of oceanfront shore in Indian River County. Vero Beach also has other free public access trails and walkways with beach access, such as Riomar Beach, Sea Cove, Sea Grape Trail, Sexton Plaza, and Turtle Trail. Water recreation in the Indian River Lagoon[edit] The Indian River Lagoon, passing through Vero Beach, forms a significant portion of the Intracoastal Waterway, and is a hub for boating, fishing, water skiing, diving, kayaking and other small-craft waterborne activities. Resorts[edit] Disney's Vero Beach Resort is officially located in Wabasso, a small town north of Vero Beach. Historic Dodgertown[edit] Vero Beach is home to Historic Dodgertown, which initially started operations during World War II as a U.S. Naval Air Station, and later served as the Spring Training facility of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team, until 2008. After the team's departure for a new Spring home in Arizona in 2008, it has served as a year-round multi-purpose facility for athletes of all ages. As of January 2, 2019, MLB has assumed control of the historic facilities with plans to expand the complex and rename it The Jackie Robinson Training Complex. This is to honor both the late Jackie Robinson and the site's history as the first racially integrated spring-training center in the American South.[24] Vero Beach had been the Spring training home of the Los Angeles Dodgers since 1948. The Dodgers left Vero Beach in 2008 for Glendale, AZ.

Her soft and gentle touch represents the warmth of motherhood. Her love is overwhelming and all-encompassing. She takes new forms when her emotions overtake her, and she displays the full range of what women can do in society.The worship of Parvati (and her other popular forms Durga and Kali) originated on the Indian subcontinent before the Common Era. Though Parvati isn’t mentioned explicitly in the Vedas, the ancient texts that laid the foundations for today’s Hinduism, her alternative names do appear in these scriptures. Some interpretations classify her as a “mountain goddess,” and others consider her to be combinations of earlier appearing goddesses. In the modern tradition, she is the spouse of the destroyer Shiva, mother to their children, and the gentle aspect of the universal goddess, Devi.Watch: Casting Curses and Love Spells with the Most Powerful Witches in RomaniaParvati can embody many forms, each of which is worshipped as an individual goddess in her own right. One of her forms, Durga, is the warrior and protector goddess. She rides astride a ferocious tiger, charging into battle and destroying evil. Her many arms hold weapons like a trident and a discus, as well as the lotus blossom and a conch shell. Communities of Punjabi Hindus praise Durga with jagratas, an all-night ritual in which they sing bhajans, or Hindu holy songs, for the goddess.During the nine-day lunar celebration of Navratri, which takes place in autumn every year, devotees celebrate Durga’s triumph over the buffalo demon Mahishasura and the restoration of dharma, or cosmic law and order. She is worshipped as a mother to all, often called Durga Ma. And since oral tradition holds that Durga Ma has been known to walk the Earth as a little girl giving out blessings, children—especially little girls—are often worshipped in these communities as the representation of the goddess.Another form, Kali, is the creator and destroyer goddess. Her blood-soaked sword cuts the bonds of ignorance and ego, which are represented by the severed head she holds in one of her many hands. In the stories, she’s called forth when Durga goes into battle and she emerges from the goddess’ head. Though she looks fearsome and full of bloodlust, she is also Mother Nature herself. Kali represents the time before this world existed, when all was blackness. She is often depicted with black or blue skin, black to reflect the time from before and blue for the oceans and sky. Her unbraided mane speaks to freedom from society’s bondage.AdvertisementKali is revered in many parts of the subcontinent and beyond as a universal mother and, like Durga, is often referred to as Kali Ma. In Bengal, Kali worship has been around for centuries. Devotees approach her with love, as they would their own mothers. Animal sacrifice in Kali’s name still occurs in parts of Bengal and the Indian states of Assam and Odisha, though there are ancient Hindu rules on how the sacrifice must be carried out in order to free the animal from the cruel cycle of life and death.IdentityThe Illustrator Drawing Brown Girls as Hindu GoddessesZing Tsjeng08.25.17Other popular forms Parvati takes include Kamakshi, a love goddess, and Annapurna, the goddess of abundance. And there are many more faces to the goddess, all of which are worshipped and beloved in states across South and Southeast Asia. Iterations of her goddess forms have become part of Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, and tantric traditions. Parvati is everywhere at once—an omnipresent mother watching over her children.I learned about Parvati and the fierce way she protects her children through a series of classic comic books called Amar Chitra Katha, which taught children Indian stories and Hindu mythology. My family’s own practice tends to lean more towards devotion to Krishna and other masculine deities, but I have also felt a deep attachment to the goddesses, of which Hinduism has many, specifically Durga. I envied her power and force. When I was a baby, my grandmother gave me a small coin pendant with an etching of Durga on it, her legs over the back of a tiger and her many arms raised. When I found it years later, it made so much sense to me that I would choose Durga above the other gods in the pantheon—I had been touched by her presence early in my life, and her energy had blossomed in me.For More Stories Like This, Sign Up for Our NewsletterThere are many who engage in altar worship. Their altars, also called mandaps or mandirs, take over a corner in their homes or, depending on the practice, a whole room. My grandmother in New Delhi has a side room dedicated to her daily poojas, or worship. Incense, flower offerings, and porcelain figures of the deities take up a whole wall in her room. Many of the items needed for devotion can be purchased in local Indian grocery stores. A metal plate to do aarti, hosting a small clay or metal diya lamp, figurines of the worshipper’s gods, garlands of flowers (real or plastic), and incense can often all be purchased in the same shops that sell Bollywood DVDs and samosas. It is better to patronize these stores rather than, say, Etsy shops not based in South Asian or owned by non-worshippers.Some readings of Hinduism offer all devotees the ability to worship within themselves as well as their homes. I don’t personally maintain a mandap, though I do collect figurines and statues of the deities I call on for guidance. However you choose to pay homage to the mother goddess, do so with an open heart and an eye towards wellness.Tagged:ukFeminismeReligionoccultloreBroadly OccultBroadly FeminismBroadly LoreORIGINAL REPORTING ON EVERYTHING THAT MATTERS IN YOUR INBOX.SubscribeBy signing up to the VICE newsletter you agree to receive electronic communications from VICE that may sometimes include advertisements or sponsored content.AdvertisementAbout JobsPartnerVICE VoicesContent Funding on VICESecurity PolicyPrivacy & TermsAccessibility Statement© 2021 VICE MEDIA GROUP",Parvati

She had previously competed in Survivor: Cook Islands in which she placed sixth,[1] and later was the runner-up in Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains. In 2020, she competed on the show's 40th season, Survivor: Winners at War, where she placed 16th. She is widely considered by fans and critics to be one of the most skilled contestants ever to participate.[2] From July 7, 2011 to October 14, 2011, Shallow starred in CBS's Around the World for Free.[3] From 2013 to 2014, she was the host of Survivor Live on CBS.com, a weekly web-exclusive series where she interviews the voted off castaways from Survivor and chats with other special guests such as former players.

She has three siblings and her family moved to Atlanta when she was 11 years old.[4] She attended the University of Georgia and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in journalism.[4] Shallow began competing in boxing in 2004. She and some fellow boxers created a non-profit organization titled ""Knockouts for Girls"", a charity that provides scholarships and boxing lessons for underprivileged girls.[4] Survivor[edit] Shallow originally auditioned for The Amazing Race along with her friend. They did not make the final cut. CBS producers, however, remembered her from her auditions and then approached her to take part in Survivor, which she gladly accepted.[5] Cook Islands[edit] Main article: Survivor: Cook Islands Shallow originally appeared as part of the Rarotonga (Raro) tribe, which represented Caucasians, along with Adam Gentry, Jonathan Penner, Jessica ""Flicka"" Smith, and Candice Woodcock. Her tribe did not face any danger for the first six days as they had won immunity. At the end of the second immunity challenge, Billy Garcia of the Aitutaki (Aitu) tribe told Shallow and Woodcock that he was next to go. Woodcock replied, ""We love you,"" and Garcia believed that Woodcock had fallen in love with him. Shallow was particularly allied with Gentry and Woodcock, who truly were romantically involved. When the four tribes were merged into two, Shallow and Gentry remained in Raro while their other tribe mates were sent to Aitu. Despite being stronger in number, the new Raro continually lost in challenges. Shallow pressed for the elimination of J.P. Calderon, whom she thought as arrogant, and he became the fourth person voted out despite his physical strength. Shallow survived her tribe's next three Tribal Councils as Calderon, Stephannie Favor, and Cristina Coria were each voted off. When the contestants were down to 12, a ""Mutiny"" twist was presented where anybody could change tribe affiliations, and for the first time it was accepted. Shallow's former tribe mates Penner and Woodcock decided to jump back to Raro, thus putting all remaining Caucasian contestants on the same tribe again. Raro lost the next two Immunity challenges, but Shallow remained loyal to her original Raro tribemates by eliminating Brad Virata, Rebecca Borman, and Jenny Guzon-Bae. At the merge, despite coming with a 5–4 member advantage over Aitu, Shallow found herself in the minority as Penner betrayed his former tribe mates and joined the Aitu Four in voting out Nate Gonzalez. She became angry with Penner, and a day after his betrayal, when she cut her thumb with a machete while cutting a coconut, she said that she was imagining the coconut was Penner's head. After alliance member Woodcock was eliminated, Shallow and Gentry found themselves fighting for survival. Despite being on the outside, Shallow was able to retain her strength and win two reward challenges, one being the ""loved one"" challenge. This worried the Aitu Four, who were dissatisfied with how Gentry and Shallow lay around camp sleeping, while they worked and got their food. In an attempt to stay in the game, Gentry and Shallow talked to Yul Kwon about voting out Penner first in exchange for their jury votes, a plan which succeeded. On day 36, Shallow was finally voted out in a 4–2 vote when the Aitu Four saw her craftiness as more of a threat than Gentry's physical strength. As a juror, she cast her vote for eventual runner-up Ozzy Lusth. Shallow was noted for being a flirt throughout the season. She flirted with Gonzalez to ensure his loyalty, had 'cuddle sessions' with Gentry, and sat naked in a hot tub with Kwon and Lusth during a challenge reward. Micronesia[edit] Main article: Survivor: Micronesia Shallow returned as a ""Favorite"" and part of the Malakal tribe. She formed a close bond with James Clement and the two formed an alliance with another couple consisting of Amanda Kimmel and Ozzy Lusth. After their tribe lost the first Immunity Challenge, they tried swinging Jonny Fairplay over to their side to gain a majority over the alliance of Yau-Man Chan, Ami Cusack, Eliza Orlins, and Jonathan Penner. However, Fairplay was voted out instead as per his wishes, since he was aching to return home to his pregnant girlfriend. Shallow then made a pact with Cirie Fields to go all the way to the Final Three with Kimmel. After losing the third Immunity Challenge, Shallow was targeted by the opposing alliance, but her own alliance (now with Fields) succeeded in voting off strategic threat Chan. At the tribal switch, Shallow and Clement were separated from their alliance as they moved to Airai. However, she remained safe as her tribe won the remaining tribal Immunity Challenges. On day 20, she made a deal with Natalie Bolton for an alliance with Clement and Alexis Jones, plus a Final Four deal with Jones and Kimmel; Bolton accepted both deals. At the merge, Shallow found herself in a good position as she was allied with six (Jones, Kimmel, Fields, Bolton, Lusth, Clement) of the nine people left. During the tenth Immunity Challenge, Shallow convinced Jason Siska to step down from the challenge so that she could win Immunity, which worked (under the condition that the tribe would not vote off Siska). However, her ""Couples Alliance"" decided to go back on their word and they targeted Siska. However, Fields saw this as an opportunity to blindside physical threat Lusth instead, and she needed Shallow's help for it to work. Shallow agreed to this and recruited her Airai female allies Bolton and Jones to the plan, and Lusth was voted off 5–4. Afterward, Shallow found herself in a failed attempt to patch things up with Clement and Kimmel (who kept her distrust to herself). The five remaining women then formed an alliance to vote off the men, starting with Siska. However, when Clement was evacuated and Erik Reichenbach won Immunity, they were forced to vote off one of their own. Kimmel was the intended target, a plan of which Shallow did not want any part. So she helped Kimmel find the Hidden Immunity Idol (which was buried under the tribal flag) and together, they voted off possible jury threat Jones. Shallow made it all the way to the Final Three with Fields and Kimmel (as promised). However, she was heartbroken to learn that only two of them would face the jury. She was eliminated first at the Final Immunity Challenge but was chosen to be in the Final Two by Kimmel as Kimmel felt that Fields would be extremely tough to beat at the Final Tribal Council. At the Final Tribal Council, Shallow convinced the jury to vote for her because of her aggressive game play compared to her previous season. Despite being accused of being a mean person by Orlins and a backstabber by Lusth, the jury decided to award Shallow the title of Sole Survivor with a close vote of 5–3, getting votes from Orlins, Siska, Jones, Bolton, and Fields. Heroes vs. Villains[edit] Main article: Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains Shallow returned to play Survivor for a third time as a part of the Villains tribe. She quickly accepted an alliance with Russell Hantz and Danielle DiLorenzo. On day 18, the Villains lost immunity, and the alliance of Shallow, Hantz, and DiLorenzo were still struggling to gain control of the game. They finally gained control when they persuaded Jerri Manthey to switch sides and vote out Hantz's rival, Rob Mariano. Because the Villains had yet to vote out a female member at that point in the game, the Heroes assumed that the Villains tribe was being run by an all-women alliance, led by Shallow. When the Villains lost immunity again on day 21, they decided to further confirm the Heroes' belief of that, by voting out Benjamin ""Coach"" Wade. Shallow and DiLorenzo both found the hidden immunity idol together and decided not to tell Hantz. On day 24, the Villains lost immunity again and James ""J. T."" Thomas Jr. gave his idol to Hantz, in hopes that he would use it to vote out Shallow. Hantz, however, showed it to Shallow, along with DiLorenzo and Manthey. On day 25, the Heroes and Villains merged into Yin Yang and went to live at the old Heroes camp. Shallow and Hantz came up with this story that they both played their idol, negating all votes, and that in the re-vote, they eliminated Courtney Yates. The new tribe quickly alienated Shallow, making her swear to get revenge on all of the Heroes. For the immunity challenge on day 27, she and DiLorenzo were the last two remaining. Shallow decided to concede immunity, because she already had one idol. Before Tribal Council, Hantz gave her his idol, as well. She then went and talked to Kimmel, who warned that Shallow should play the idol for herself. But at Tribal Council, Shallow, not trusting Kimmel's warning, played both idols on Sandra Diaz-Twine and Manthey, sending Thomas home in a 5–0 vote. On day 33, Hantz won immunity, and decided to turn on his alliance. He tried to pit Shallow and DiLorenzo against each other, but failed. He then aligned with the Heroes to vote DiLorenzo out, and with some help from Manthey, DiLorenzo was voted out in a 4–3 vote. He then aligned with the Heroes again and decided to target Shallow. However, his plan was ruined when she won immunity on day 36. Shallow then won her third challenge on day 37, and they voted the last Hero, Colby Donaldson, out of the game in a 4–1 vote. After Shallow failed to win the final immunity challenge, it seemed that she would be voted out, since everyone wanted her gone. She, on the other hand, wanted to get rid of Diaz-Twine, thinking she would get a lot of votes in the end. However, the four remaining players voted out Manthey in a 3–1 vote; Hantz had believed he would get her vote to win Sole Survivor. In the end, Shallow came in second, gaining the jury votes of fellow Villains Wade, DiLorenzo, and Manthey. She beat out Hantz, who received zero votes, but was defeated by Diaz-Twine, who got the votes of all the Heroes, plus Yates, who was in an alliance with Diaz-Twine while still in the game and Diaz-Twine’s heroic gameplay. By the end of Heroes vs. Villains, Shallow had played a total of 114 days on Survivor, the most at that time. Winners at War[edit] Main article: Survivor: Winners at War Shallow once again returned to compete on the show's 40th season, Survivor: Winners at War. She was a member of the Sele tribe and aligned with fellow old schoolers Boston Rob Mariano, Ethan Zohn, and Danni Boatwright. However, when Sele lost immunity on day 6, Boatwright felt betrayed by Shallow and told Mariano to target Shallow instead of one of the new school players. Mariano told Shallow this plan, and Boatwright was voted out unanimously. Shallow was able to survive a few more votes until the tribe swap. After the swap, she remained on Sele along with former Sele member Michele Fitzgerald and three former Dakal members—Yul Kwon, Nick Wilson, and Wendell Holland. After losing the second immunity challenge as new tribes, Shallow found herself in the minority along with Fitzgerald. She was unsuccessful in convincing Wilson to flip and was voted out in episode 6 in a 3-2 vote, becoming the seventh person sent to the Edge of Extinction. She bequeathed her fire tokens to Fitzgerald. Shallow's journey for this season came to an end on day 35 after failing to win the chance to re-enter the game in the second and final Edge of Extinction challenge. As a juror, she cast her vote for eventual runner-up Natalie Anderson.[6][7] With 149 days played over four seasons, Shallow had played the second-longest Survivor career, only behind Mariano's 152, both of which surpassed the previous record set by Ozzy Lusth after his participation in Survivor: Game Changers in 2017, at 128. Reception[edit] Shallow was one of the first five inductees into the ""Survivor Hall of Fame"" in the year 2010, alongside Hantz, Mariano, Diaz-Twine, and Richard Hatch. She is also one of only eight players to make it to Final Tribal Council more than once, along with Hantz, Mariano, Diaz-Twine, Kimmel, Fitzgerald, Anderson, and Tony Vlachos. Reality TV podcaster and former Survivor contestant Rob Cesternino twice conducted online polls (in 2011 and 2014) for the greatest contestant in the show's history; Shallow won both times the poll was held.[8][9][10] She has also performed well in the awards ceremony known as the ""Ozcars,"" from prominent Survivor fan site ""Survivor Oz;"" ever since the first awards in 2012, Shallow has always won the award for ""Sexiest Female of All Time,"" and in 2013, she also won the two biggest awards of ""Greatest Player of All Time"" and ""Best Winner.""[11][12] In the official issue of CBS Watch commemorating the 15th anniversary of Survivor, Shallow was voted by viewers as the fourth greatest contestant in the history of the series (only behind Cesternino, Hantz, and Mariano), and was the highest-ranking female contestant.[13] Also, she was the only three-time contestant in the top ten to have all three of her seasons also be ranked by viewers as among the top ten greatest seasons of all time—Cook Islands was ranked tenth, Micronesia was ranked third, and Heroes vs. Villains was ranked first.[14] In addition, she came in second in the same magazine's poll for the most attractive female contestant, only behind Brenda Lowe of Survivor: Nicaragua and Survivor: Caramoan.[15] Accordingly, Shallow was the only female contestant to appear in both polls, and one of only two contestants overall to appear in the ""greatest players"" poll and one of the ""most attractive"" polls, the other being Lusth, her fellow Cook Islands and Micronesia player. In 2017, Entertainment Weekly had fans of the series rank the 34 winners and Shallow came in 1st place.[16] In 2015, host Jeff Probst named Shallow one of his top ten favorite Survivor winners, and one of his top four favorite female winners.[17] In 2020, before the premiere of Winners at War, Probst named Shallow the best winner ever.[18] Personal life[edit] In 2009, Shallow and fellow Survivor contestant Amanda Kimmel made an appearance in the movie Into the Blue 2.[19] Shallow hosted the third season of the webseries Around the World For Free, which began airing on July 5, 2011.[20] In 2014, Shallow began dating fellow Survivor alum John Fincher, who competed on Survivor: Samoa. They announced their engagement in January 2017 and married on July 16, 2017.[21][22] They had a daughter in July 2018.[23] Shallow currently resides in Los Angeles, California and is a yoga teacher.[24][25] In 2020, Shallow co-authored a children's book about the importance of mindfulness titled Om the Otter.[26] Filmography[edit] Television[edit] Year Title Role Notes 2006 Survivor: Cook Islands Contestant Eliminated; 6th place 2008 Survivor Micronesia — Fans vs. Favorites Contestant Winner 2010 Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains Contestant Runner-up 2014 Survivor: Cagayan Guest Episode 14: “Reunion Special” 2020 Survivor: Winners at War Contestant Eliminated; 15th place References[edit] ^ Lang, Derrik J.

She had previously competed in Survivor: Cook Islands in which she placed sixth,[1] and later was the runner-up in Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains. In 2020, she competed on the show's 40th season, Survivor: Winners at War, where she placed 16th. She is widely considered by fans and critics to be one of the most skilled contestants ever to participate.[2] From July 7, 2011 to October 14, 2011, Shallow starred in CBS's Around the World for Free.[3] From 2013 to 2014, she was the host of Survivor Live on CBS.com, a weekly web-exclusive series where she interviews the voted off castaways from Survivor and chats with other special guests such as former players.

She has three siblings and her family moved to Atlanta when she was 11 years old.[4] She attended the University of Georgia and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in journalism.[4] Shallow began competing in boxing in 2004. She and some fellow boxers created a non-profit organization titled ""Knockouts for Girls"", a charity that provides scholarships and boxing lessons for underprivileged girls.[4] Survivor[edit] Shallow originally auditioned for The Amazing Race along with her friend. They did not make the final cut. CBS producers, however, remembered her from her auditions and then approached her to take part in Survivor, which she gladly accepted.[5] Cook Islands[edit] Main article: Survivor: Cook Islands Shallow originally appeared as part of the Rarotonga (Raro) tribe, which represented Caucasians, along with Adam Gentry, Jonathan Penner, Jessica ""Flicka"" Smith, and Candice Woodcock. Her tribe did not face any danger for the first six days as they had won immunity. At the end of the second immunity challenge, Billy Garcia of the Aitutaki (Aitu) tribe told Shallow and Woodcock that he was next to go. Woodcock replied, ""We love you,"" and Garcia believed that Woodcock had fallen in love with him. Shallow was particularly allied with Gentry and Woodcock, who truly were romantically involved. When the four tribes were merged into two, Shallow and Gentry remained in Raro while their other tribe mates were sent to Aitu. Despite being stronger in number, the new Raro continually lost in challenges. Shallow pressed for the elimination of J.P. Calderon, whom she thought as arrogant, and he became the fourth person voted out despite his physical strength. Shallow survived her tribe's next three Tribal Councils as Calderon, Stephannie Favor, and Cristina Coria were each voted off. When the contestants were down to 12, a ""Mutiny"" twist was presented where anybody could change tribe affiliations, and for the first time it was accepted. Shallow's former tribe mates Penner and Woodcock decided to jump back to Raro, thus putting all remaining Caucasian contestants on the same tribe again. Raro lost the next two Immunity challenges, but Shallow remained loyal to her original Raro tribemates by eliminating Brad Virata, Rebecca Borman, and Jenny Guzon-Bae. At the merge, despite coming with a 5–4 member advantage over Aitu, Shallow found herself in the minority as Penner betrayed his former tribe mates and joined the Aitu Four in voting out Nate Gonzalez. She became angry with Penner, and a day after his betrayal, when she cut her thumb with a machete while cutting a coconut, she said that she was imagining the coconut was Penner's head. After alliance member Woodcock was eliminated, Shallow and Gentry found themselves fighting for survival. Despite being on the outside, Shallow was able to retain her strength and win two reward challenges, one being the ""loved one"" challenge. This worried the Aitu Four, who were dissatisfied with how Gentry and Shallow lay around camp sleeping, while they worked and got their food. In an attempt to stay in the game, Gentry and Shallow talked to Yul Kwon about voting out Penner first in exchange for their jury votes, a plan which succeeded. On day 36, Shallow was finally voted out in a 4–2 vote when the Aitu Four saw her craftiness as more of a threat than Gentry's physical strength. As a juror, she cast her vote for eventual runner-up Ozzy Lusth. Shallow was noted for being a flirt throughout the season. She flirted with Gonzalez to ensure his loyalty, had 'cuddle sessions' with Gentry, and sat naked in a hot tub with Kwon and Lusth during a challenge reward. Micronesia[edit] Main article: Survivor: Micronesia Shallow returned as a ""Favorite"" and part of the Malakal tribe. She formed a close bond with James Clement and the two formed an alliance with another couple consisting of Amanda Kimmel and Ozzy Lusth. After their tribe lost the first Immunity Challenge, they tried swinging Jonny Fairplay over to their side to gain a majority over the alliance of Yau-Man Chan, Ami Cusack, Eliza Orlins, and Jonathan Penner. However, Fairplay was voted out instead as per his wishes, since he was aching to return home to his pregnant girlfriend. Shallow then made a pact with Cirie Fields to go all the way to the Final Three with Kimmel. After losing the third Immunity Challenge, Shallow was targeted by the opposing alliance, but her own alliance (now with Fields) succeeded in voting off strategic threat Chan. At the tribal switch, Shallow and Clement were separated from their alliance as they moved to Airai. However, she remained safe as her tribe won the remaining tribal Immunity Challenges. On day 20, she made a deal with Natalie Bolton for an alliance with Clement and Alexis Jones, plus a Final Four deal with Jones and Kimmel; Bolton accepted both deals. At the merge, Shallow found herself in a good position as she was allied with six (Jones, Kimmel, Fields, Bolton, Lusth, Clement) of the nine people left. During the tenth Immunity Challenge, Shallow convinced Jason Siska to step down from the challenge so that she could win Immunity, which worked (under the condition that the tribe would not vote off Siska). However, her ""Couples Alliance"" decided to go back on their word and they targeted Siska. However, Fields saw this as an opportunity to blindside physical threat Lusth instead, and she needed Shallow's help for it to work. Shallow agreed to this and recruited her Airai female allies Bolton and Jones to the plan, and Lusth was voted off 5–4. Afterward, Shallow found herself in a failed attempt to patch things up with Clement and Kimmel (who kept her distrust to herself). The five remaining women then formed an alliance to vote off the men, starting with Siska. However, when Clement was evacuated and Erik Reichenbach won Immunity, they were forced to vote off one of their own. Kimmel was the intended target, a plan of which Shallow did not want any part. So she helped Kimmel find the Hidden Immunity Idol (which was buried under the tribal flag) and together, they voted off possible jury threat Jones. Shallow made it all the way to the Final Three with Fields and Kimmel (as promised). However, she was heartbroken to learn that only two of them would face the jury. She was eliminated first at the Final Immunity Challenge but was chosen to be in the Final Two by Kimmel as Kimmel felt that Fields would be extremely tough to beat at the Final Tribal Council. At the Final Tribal Council, Shallow convinced the jury to vote for her because of her aggressive game play compared to her previous season. Despite being accused of being a mean person by Orlins and a backstabber by Lusth, the jury decided to award Shallow the title of Sole Survivor with a close vote of 5–3, getting votes from Orlins, Siska, Jones, Bolton, and Fields. Heroes vs. Villains[edit] Main article: Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains Shallow returned to play Survivor for a third time as a part of the Villains tribe. She quickly accepted an alliance with Russell Hantz and Danielle DiLorenzo. On day 18, the Villains lost immunity, and the alliance of Shallow, Hantz, and DiLorenzo were still struggling to gain control of the game. They finally gained control when they persuaded Jerri Manthey to switch sides and vote out Hantz's rival, Rob Mariano. Because the Villains had yet to vote out a female member at that point in the game, the Heroes assumed that the Villains tribe was being run by an all-women alliance, led by Shallow. When the Villains lost immunity again on day 21, they decided to further confirm the Heroes' belief of that, by voting out Benjamin ""Coach"" Wade. Shallow and DiLorenzo both found the hidden immunity idol together and decided not to tell Hantz. On day 24, the Villains lost immunity again and James ""J. T."" Thomas Jr. gave his idol to Hantz, in hopes that he would use it to vote out Shallow. Hantz, however, showed it to Shallow, along with DiLorenzo and Manthey. On day 25, the Heroes and Villains merged into Yin Yang and went to live at the old Heroes camp. Shallow and Hantz came up with this story that they both played their idol, negating all votes, and that in the re-vote, they eliminated Courtney Yates. The new tribe quickly alienated Shallow, making her swear to get revenge on all of the Heroes. For the immunity challenge on day 27, she and DiLorenzo were the last two remaining. Shallow decided to concede immunity, because she already had one idol. Before Tribal Council, Hantz gave her his idol, as well. She then went and talked to Kimmel, who warned that Shallow should play the idol for herself. But at Tribal Council, Shallow, not trusting Kimmel's warning, played both idols on Sandra Diaz-Twine and Manthey, sending Thomas home in a 5–0 vote. On day 33, Hantz won immunity, and decided to turn on his alliance. He tried to pit Shallow and DiLorenzo against each other, but failed. He then aligned with the Heroes to vote DiLorenzo out, and with some help from Manthey, DiLorenzo was voted out in a 4–3 vote. He then aligned with the Heroes again and decided to target Shallow. However, his plan was ruined when she won immunity on day 36. Shallow then won her third challenge on day 37, and they voted the last Hero, Colby Donaldson, out of the game in a 4–1 vote. After Shallow failed to win the final immunity challenge, it seemed that she would be voted out, since everyone wanted her gone. She, on the other hand, wanted to get rid of Diaz-Twine, thinking she would get a lot of votes in the end. However, the four remaining players voted out Manthey in a 3–1 vote; Hantz had believed he would get her vote to win Sole Survivor. In the end, Shallow came in second, gaining the jury votes of fellow Villains Wade, DiLorenzo, and Manthey. She beat out Hantz, who received zero votes, but was defeated by Diaz-Twine, who got the votes of all the Heroes, plus Yates, who was in an alliance with Diaz-Twine while still in the game and Diaz-Twine’s heroic gameplay. By the end of Heroes vs. Villains, Shallow had played a total of 114 days on Survivor, the most at that time. Winners at War[edit] Main article: Survivor: Winners at War Shallow once again returned to compete on the show's 40th season, Survivor: Winners at War. She was a member of the Sele tribe and aligned with fellow old schoolers Boston Rob Mariano, Ethan Zohn, and Danni Boatwright. However, when Sele lost immunity on day 6, Boatwright felt betrayed by Shallow and told Mariano to target Shallow instead of one of the new school players. Mariano told Shallow this plan, and Boatwright was voted out unanimously. Shallow was able to survive a few more votes until the tribe swap. After the swap, she remained on Sele along with former Sele member Michele Fitzgerald and three former Dakal members—Yul Kwon, Nick Wilson, and Wendell Holland. After losing the second immunity challenge as new tribes, Shallow found herself in the minority along with Fitzgerald. She was unsuccessful in convincing Wilson to flip and was voted out in episode 6 in a 3-2 vote, becoming the seventh person sent to the Edge of Extinction. She bequeathed her fire tokens to Fitzgerald. Shallow's journey for this season came to an end on day 35 after failing to win the chance to re-enter the game in the second and final Edge of Extinction challenge. As a juror, she cast her vote for eventual runner-up Natalie Anderson.[6][7] With 149 days played over four seasons, Shallow had played the second-longest Survivor career, only behind Mariano's 152, both of which surpassed the previous record set by Ozzy Lusth after his participation in Survivor: Game Changers in 2017, at 128. Reception[edit] Shallow was one of the first five inductees into the ""Survivor Hall of Fame"" in the year 2010, alongside Hantz, Mariano, Diaz-Twine, and Richard Hatch. She is also one of only eight players to make it to Final Tribal Council more than once, along with Hantz, Mariano, Diaz-Twine, Kimmel, Fitzgerald, Anderson, and Tony Vlachos. Reality TV podcaster and former Survivor contestant Rob Cesternino twice conducted online polls (in 2011 and 2014) for the greatest contestant in the show's history; Shallow won both times the poll was held.[8][9][10] She has also performed well in the awards ceremony known as the ""Ozcars,"" from prominent Survivor fan site ""Survivor Oz;"" ever since the first awards in 2012, Shallow has always won the award for ""Sexiest Female of All Time,"" and in 2013, she also won the two biggest awards of ""Greatest Player of All Time"" and ""Best Winner.""[11][12] In the official issue of CBS Watch commemorating the 15th anniversary of Survivor, Shallow was voted by viewers as the fourth greatest contestant in the history of the series (only behind Cesternino, Hantz, and Mariano), and was the highest-ranking female contestant.[13] Also, she was the only three-time contestant in the top ten to have all three of her seasons also be ranked by viewers as among the top ten greatest seasons of all time—Cook Islands was ranked tenth, Micronesia was ranked third, and Heroes vs. Villains was ranked first.[14] In addition, she came in second in the same magazine's poll for the most attractive female contestant, only behind Brenda Lowe of Survivor: Nicaragua and Survivor: Caramoan.[15] Accordingly, Shallow was the only female contestant to appear in both polls, and one of only two contestants overall to appear in the ""greatest players"" poll and one of the ""most attractive"" polls, the other being Lusth, her fellow Cook Islands and Micronesia player. In 2017, Entertainment Weekly had fans of the series rank the 34 winners and Shallow came in 1st place.[16] In 2015, host Jeff Probst named Shallow one of his top ten favorite Survivor winners, and one of his top four favorite female winners.[17] In 2020, before the premiere of Winners at War, Probst named Shallow the best winner ever.[18] Personal life[edit] In 2009, Shallow and fellow Survivor contestant Amanda Kimmel made an appearance in the movie Into the Blue 2.[19] Shallow hosted the third season of the webseries Around the World For Free, which began airing on July 5, 2011.[20] In 2014, Shallow began dating fellow Survivor alum John Fincher, who competed on Survivor: Samoa.

She is the Mother goddess in Hinduism,[1][9] and has many attributes and aspects. Along with Lakshmi and Saraswati, she forms the Tridevi of Hindu goddesses.[10] Parvati is the wife of the Hindu god Shiva, who according to Shaivism is the protector, the destroyer, and regenerator of the universe and all life. She is the reincarnation of Sati, Shiva's first wife who died during a yajna.[11] Parvati is the daughter of the mountain king Himavan and queen Mena.[12] Parvati is the mother of Hindu deities Ganesha and Kartikeya. The Puranas also referenced her to be the sister of the river goddess Ganga and the preserver god Vishnu.[13][3] She is the divine energy between a man and a woman, like the energy of Shiva and Shakti. She is also one of the five equivalent deities worshipped in Panchayatana puja of the Smarta Tradition of Hinduism.[14] Parvati is a form of Shakti. In Shaivism, she is the recreative energy and power of Shiva, and she is the cause of a bond that connects all beings and a means of their spiritual release.[15][16] In Hindu temples dedicated to her and Shiva, she is symbolically represented as the argha. She is found extensively in ancient Indian literature, and her statues and iconography grace Hindu temples all over South Asia and Southeast Asia.[17][18] Contents 1 Etymology and nomenclature 2 History 3 Iconography and symbolism 4 Manifestations 5 Legends 6 Parvati in culture 6.1 Festivals 6.1.1 Teej festival 6.1.2 Gauri Festival 6.1.3 Navratri 6.1.4 Gauri Tritiya 6.1.5 Thiruvathira 6.2 Arts 6.3 Numismatics 7 Major temples 7.1 List of temples 8 Outside India 9 Related goddesses 10 Notes 11 References 12 Further reading 13 External links Etymology and nomenclature Further information: Hindu literature Parvati as a two-armed consort goddess of Shiva (left), and as four-armed Lalita with her sons Ganesha and Skanda, Odisha, India. 11th century sculpture from the British Museum. 1872,0701.54 . Parvata (पर्वत) is one of the Sanskrit words for ""mountain""; ""Parvati"" derives her name from being the daughter of king Himavan (also called Himavat, Parvat) and mother Mainavati.[11][12] King Parvat is considered lord of the mountains and the personification of the Himalayas; Parvati implies ""she of the mountain"".[19] Parvati is known by many names in Hindu literature.[20] Other names which associate her with mountains are Shailaja (Daughter of the mountains), Adrija or Nagajaa or Shailaputri (Daughter of Mountains), Haimavathi (Daughter of Himavan), Devi Maheshwari, and Girija or Girirajaputri (Daughter of king of the mountains).[21] She is also called Narayani because she is the sister of Narayana. The Lalita sahasranama contains a listing of 1,000 names of Parvati (as Lalita).[22] Two of Parvati's most famous epithets are Uma and Aparna.[23] The name Uma is used for Sati (Shiva's first wife, who is reborn as Parvati) in earlier texts,[which?] but in the Ramayana, it is used as a synonym for Parvati. In the Harivamsa, Parvati is referred to as Aparna ('One who took no sustenance') and then addressed as Uma, who was dissuaded by her mother from severe austerity by saying u mā ('oh, don't').[24] She is also Ambika ('dear mother'), Shakti ('power'), Mataji ('revered mother'), Maheshwari ('great goddess'), Durga (invincible), Bhairavi ('ferocious'), Bhavani ('fertility and birthing'), Shivaradni ('Queen of Shiva'), Urvi or Renu, and many hundreds of others. Parvati is also the goddess of love and devotion, or Kamakshi; the goddess of fertility, abundance and food/nourishment, or Annapurna.[25] She is also the ferocious Mahakali that wields a sword, wears a garland of severed heads, and protects her devotees and destroys all evil that plagues the world and its beings. The apparent contradiction that Parvati is addressed as the golden one, Gauri, as well as the dark one, Kali or Shyama, as a calm and placid wife Parvati mentioned as Gauri and as a goddess who destroys evil she is Kali. Regional stories of Gauri suggest an alternate origin for Gauri's name and complexion. In parts of India, Gauri's skin color is golden or yellow in honor of her being the goddess of ripened corn/harvest and fertility.[26][27] History Further information: Vedic literature Coinage of Kushan ruler Huvishka with, on the reverse, the divine couple Ommo (""ΟΜΜΟ"", Umā) holding a flower, and Oesho (""ΟΗϷΟ"", Shiva) with four arms holding attributes. Circa 150-180 CE.[28][29] The word Parvati does not explicitly appear in Vedic literature.[30] Instead, Ambika, Rudrani and others are found in the Rigveda.[30] The verse 3.12 of the Kena Upanishad dated to mid 1st millennium BCE contains a goddess called Uma-Haimavati, a very common alternate name for Parvati.[30] Sayana's commentary in Anuvaka, however, identifies Parvati in the Kena Upanishad, suggesting her to be the same as Uma and Ambika in the Upanishad, referring to Parvati is thus an embodiment of divine knowledge and the mother of the world.[20] She appears as the shakti, or essential power, of the Supreme Brahman. Her primary role is as a mediator who reveals the knowledge of Brahman to the Vedic Trideva of Agni, Vayu, and Varuna, who were boasting about their recent defeat of a group of demons.[31] But Kinsley notes: ""it is little more than conjecture to identify her with the later goddess Satī-Pārvatī, although [..] later texts that extol Śiva and Pārvatī retell the episode in such a way to leave no doubt that it was Śiva's spouse.."" [IAST original][30] Sati-Parvati appears in the epic period (400 BC–400 AD), as both the Ramayana and the Mahabharata present Parvati as Shiva's wife.[30] However, it is not until the plays of Kalidasa (5th–6th centuries) and the Puranas (4th through the 13th centuries) that the stories of Sati-Parvati and Shiva acquire more comprehensive details.[32] Kinsley adds that Parvati may have emerged from legends of non-aryan goddesses that lived in mountains.[21] While the word Uma appears in earlier Upanisads, Hopkins notes that the earliest known explicit use of the name Pārvatī occurs in late Hamsa Upanishad.[33] Weber suggests that just like Shiva is a combination of various Vedic gods Rudra and Agni, Parvati in Puranas text is a combination of wives of Rudra. In other words, the symbolism, legends, and characteristics of Parvati evolved fusing Uma, Haimavati, Ambika in one aspect and the more ferocious, destructive Kali, Gauri, Nirriti in another aspect.[20][34] Tate suggests .[35] Iconography and symbolism 12th century Parvati sculpture from Odisha.Shivlinga icons are common for Parvati and Shiva. She is symbolically the yoni in the core of a 9th-century Hindu temple of Java, Indonesia temple (left), and in Pashupatinath Temple of Nepal (right). Parvati, the gentle aspect of Devi Shakti, is usually represented as fair, beautiful, and benevolent.[36][37] She typically wears a red dress (often a sari), and may have a head-band. When depicted alongside Shiva she generally appears with two arms, but when alone she may be depicted having four. These hands may hold a trident, mirror, rosary, bell, dish, goad, sugarcane stalk, or flowers (such as a lotus).[8] One of her arms in front may be in the Abhaya mudra (hand gesture for 'fear not'), one of her children, typically Ganesha, is on her knee, while her younger son Skanda may be playing near her in her watch. In ancient temples, Parvati's sculpture is often depicted near a calf or cow – a source of food. Bronze has been the chief metal for her sculpture, while stone is the next most common material.[8] Parvati and Shiva are often symbolized by a yoni and a linga respectively. In ancient literature, yoni means womb and place of gestation, the yoni-linga metaphor represents origin, source or regenerative power.[38] The linga-yoni icon is widespread, found in Shaivite Hindu temples of South Asia and Southeast Asia. Often called Shivalinga, it almost always has both linga and the yoni.[9] The icon represents the interdependence and union of feminine and masculine energies in recreation and regeneration of all life. In some depictions, Parvati and Shiva are shown in various forms of sexual union.[9] In some iconography, Parvati's hands may symbolically express many mudras (symbolic hand gestures). For example, Kataka — representing fascination and enchantment, Hirana — representing the antelope, the symbolism for nature and the elusive, Tarjani by the left hand—representing the gesture of menace, and Chandrakal — representing the moon, a symbol of intelligence.[citation needed] Kataka is expressed by hands closer to the devotee; Tarjani mudra with the left hand, but far from the devotee. If Parvati is depicted with two hands, Kataka mudra—also called Katyavalambita or Katisamsthita hasta—is common, as well as Abhaya (fearlessness, fear not) and Varada (beneficence) are representational in Parvati's iconography. Parvati's right hand in Abhaya mudra symbolizes ""do not fear anyone or anything"", while her Varada mudra symbolizes ""wish-fulfilling"".[39] In Indian dance, Parvatimudra is dedicated to her, symbolizing divine mother. It is a joint hand gesture, and is one of sixteen Deva Hastas, denoting the most important deities described in Abhinaya Darpana. The hands mimic motherly gesture, and when included in a dance, the dancer symbolically expresses Parvati.[40] Alternatively, if both hands of the dancer are in Ardhachandra mudra, it symbolizes an alternate aspect of Parvati.[41] Parvati is sometimes shown with golden or yellow color skin, particularly as goddess Gauri, symbolizing her as the goddess of ripened harvests.[42] In some manifestations, particularly as angry, ferocious aspects of Shakti such Kali, she has eight or ten arms, and is astride on a tiger or lion, wearing a garland of severed heads and skirt of disembodied hands. In benevolent manifestations such as Kamakshi or Meenakshi, a parrot sits near her right shoulder symbolizing cheerful love talk, seeds, and fertility. A parrot is found with Parvati's form as Kamakshi – the goddess of love, as well as Kama – the cupid god of desire who shoots arrows to trigger infatuation.[43] A crescent moon is sometimes included near the head of Parvati particularly the Kamakshi icons, for her being half of Shiva. In South Indian legends, her association with the parrot began when she won a bet with her husband and asked for his loincloth as victory payment; Shiva keeps his word but first transforms her into a parrot. She flies off and takes refuge in the mountain ranges of south India, appearing as Meenakshi (also spelled Minakshi).[44] Symbolism of many aspects for the same goddess Parvati is expressed in many roles, moods, epithets, and aspects. In Hindu mythology, she is an active agent of the universe, the power of Shiva. She is expressed in nurturing and benevolent aspects, as well as destructive and ferocious aspects.[45] She is the voice of encouragement, reason, freedom, and strength, as well as of resistance, power, action and retributive justice. This paradox symbolizes her willingness to realign to Pratima (reality) and adapts to the needs of circumstances in her role as the universal mother.[45] She identifies and destroys evil to protect (Mahakali), as well as creates food and abundance to nourish (Annapurna). From being born as a human, showing determination and perseverance in marrying Shiva (who preferred being an ascetic), to realizing with the great effort her true power and potential, awakening the Adishakti in herself, and becoming a goddess venerated by the Trimurti and the rest of the entire universe, Parvati inspires a person to embrace their human strengths and flaws, and utilize them to achieve their highest potential, to live life with their head held up high. Manifestations Parvati is expressed in many different aspects. As Annapurna she feeds, as Durga she is ferocious. Several Hindu stories present alternate aspects of Parvati, such as the ferocious, violent aspect as Shakti and related forms. Shakti is pure energy, untamed, unchecked, and chaotic. Her wrath crystallizes into a dark, blood-thirsty, tangled-hair Goddess with an open mouth and a drooping tongue. This goddess is usually identified as the terrible Mahakali (time).[46] In Linga Purana, Parvati metamorphoses into Kali, on the request of Shiva, to destroy an asura (demon) Daruk. Even after destroying the demon, Kali's wrath could not be controlled. To lower Kali's rage, Shiva appeared as a crying baby. The cries of the baby raised the maternal instinct of Kali who resorts back to her benign form as Parvati.[47] In Skanda Purana, Parvati assumes the form of a warrior-goddess and defeats a demon called Durg who assumes the form of a buffalo. In this aspect, she is known by the name Durga.[48] Although Parvati is considered another aspect of Sakti, just like Kali, Durga, Kamakshi, Meenakshi, Gauri and many others in modern-day Hinduism, many of these ""forms"" or aspects originated from regional legends and traditions, and the distinctions from Parvati are pertinent.[49] In Devi Bhagavata Purana, Parvati is the lineal progenitor of all other goddesses. She is worshiped as one with many forms and names. Her form or incarnation depends on her mood. For example: Durga is a demon-fighting form of Devi, and some texts suggest Parvati took the form of Durga to kill the demon Durgamasur. Durga is worshiped in nine forms called the Navadurga. Each of the nine aspects depicts a point in the life of Parvati. She as Durga is also worshiped as the slayer of the demons Mahishasura, Shumbha, and Nishumbha. She is worshipped as Ashtabhuja Durga in the Bengali states, and as Kanakadurga in the Telugu states. Shakhambari & Satakshi are two of the forms Parvati assumed to defeat Durgamasura. The former is the Goddess of vegetables and organic food, while the latter is said to have replenished the earth's water bodies with Her tears during a great drought. kali is the most ferocious and true form of Parvati, as the goddess of time and change, representing raw power and courage, and the ultimate dissolution. Kali is worshiped as Bhadrakali in the south and as Dakshina Kali in the north. She is worshiped as Mahakali all over India. She is a member, and also the source of Tridevi. She is the feminine aspect of Parabrahman, as she is the progenitor of all primal energies. She is the active form of Adishakti. She represents tamas guna, and she is beyond the three Gunas, in that she is the material form of the void darkness in which the universe comes to exist, and in the end, everything dissolves into her. She is the ""Kriya Shakti"" of the Trishakti and the source of the other Shaktis. She is the Kundalini Shakti that resides deep within the core of every existing life form. In the form of female shaktis of various major male deities, Devi manifests as Saptamatrikas: Brahmani, Vaishnavi, Maheshwari, Indrani, Varahi, Kaumari, Chamunda (or Ashtamatrikas when depicted along with Narasimhi/Pratyangira, Vinayaki being an additional matrika. Varuni, Yami have also been suggested to be part of this pantheon sometimes. Tripura Sundari, despite being the 2nd Mahavidya is the most worshiped form of Devi right after Kali and Durga , She is consider as complete physical form of Adi Parashakti. Lalita Sahasranama is a collection of the 1000 names of Devi Lalitha and is used in Her worship in the Sri Vidya sampradaya of Tantra. Bala Tripurasundari, the child form of the goddess Tripura Sundari, representing the playful and innocent nature of children, as well as their ceaseless potential. Brahmari Devi is the six-legged bee incarnation of Parvati, which she assumed to kill the demon Arunasura, according to the Devi Bhagavata Purana. Nanda Devi/Ekanamsha is the daughter of the cowherd Nanda and his wife Yashoda. Parvati/Yogamaya/Vishnumaya was born as their daughter in the Dvapara yuga to protect Her brother Lord Krishna and admonish the demon Kansa. She is famously worshiped as Vindhya-Vasini. Kaushiki, sometimes addressed as Chandika is a manifestation of Parvati; she is white in color, has eight arms, and rides a lion, she is worshipped with the famous Devi Suktam and Narayani Stuti. She is the main deity of the Devi Mahatmyam, considered to be the most important Shakta text. It is read privately or in huge gatherings every Navaratri in Her honor. 52 Shakti Peethas suggests all goddesses are expansions of the goddess Parvati. Each of the peethas was formed when a part of Goddess Sati's body fell on earth. Sati being the previous incarnation of Parvati isn't separate from Her. There are multiple local goddesses called Grama Devis who are worshiped in famed temples all across India. Many of them are believed to be the incarnations of Parvati. These are all regional manifestations of the Divine Mother, often invoked to protect the village from epidemics and famine. Meenakshi, the Goddess with eyes shaped like fishes. She is the Queen of Madurai and is said to have been born to the devout childless queen and king of the region. She was born with 3 breasts, which were prophesied to disappear when She would meet Her husband-to-be. Eventually, She met Shiva and returns to Kailasa as Parvati. Kamakshi, Goddess of love and devotion. She is indifferent from the Supreme Goddess Tripura Sundari Vishalakshi, the Goddess who awaits Her beloved. Her temple is in Varanasi wherewith ever opened eyelids, she waits for Her husband, Lord Shiva. Akhilandeshwari, found in coastal regions of India, is the goddess associated with water.[50] Annapurna is the representation of all that is complete and of food. Parvati is said to have assumed this form to teach the inhabitants of Kailasa the value of food. She resides in Kashi as the wife of Lord Vishwanatha. Kanya Kumari, the ever-virgin Goddess. According to lore, the demon Banasura could only be killed by a virgin girl. To facilitate his death (since he had begun harassing man and god alike), Parvati was born as Sri Kumari or Sri Bala Bhadrakali. She waits at the southern tip of India, waiting for Her groom Lord Shiva to marry her. Mahagayatri, the Devi associated with the Vedas and the knowledge that they house. Navadurga, The nine forms of Durga: Shailaputri, Brahmacharini, Chandraghanta, Kushmanda, Skandamata, Katyayani, Kaalratri, Mahagauri, Siddhidhatri. Dasa Mahavidya, the ten tantric manifestations of Devi: Mahakali, Tara, Tripura Sundari, Bhuvaneshwari, Bhairavi, Bagalamukhi, Dhumavati, Chinnamasta, Matangi, Kamala. Legends Wall carvings in the 6th-century Ellora Caves: A scene depicting Kalyanasundara – the wedding of Shiva (four-armed figure, right) and Parvati (two-armed, left). The Puranas tell the tale of Sati's marriage to Shiva against her father Daksha's wishes. The conflict between Daksha and Shiva gets to a point where Daksha does not invite Shiva to his yagna (fire-sacrifice). Daksha insults Shiva when Sati comes on her own. She immolates herself at the ceremony. This shocks Shiva, who is so grief-stricken that he loses interest in worldly affairs, retires, and isolates himself in the mountains, in meditation and austerity. Sati is then reborn as Parvati, the daughter of Himavat and Mainavati,[5] and is named Parvati, or ""she from the mountains"", after her father Himavant who is also called king Parvat.[51][52][53] According to different versions of her chronicles, the maiden Parvati resolves to marry Shiva. Her parents learn of her desire, discourage her, but she pursues what she wants. Indra sends the god Kama – the Hindu god of desire, erotic love, attraction, and affection, to awake Shiva from meditation. Kama reaches Shiva and shoots an arrow of desire.[54] Shiva opens his third eye in his forehead and burns the cupid Kama to ashes. Parvati does not lose her hope or her resolve to win over Shiva. She begins to live in mountains like Shiva, engage in the same activities as Shiva, one of asceticism, yogin and tapas. This draws the attention of Shiva and awakens his interest. He meets her in disguised form, tries to discourage her, telling her Shiva's weaknesses and personality problems.[54] Parvati refuses to listen and insists on her resolve. Shiva finally accepts her and they get married.[54][55] Shiva dedicates the following hymn in Parvati's honor, I am the sea and you the wave, You are Prakṛti, and I Purusha.– Translated by Stella Kramrisch[56] Parvati with Shiva and sons Ganesha (leftmost) and Kartikeya (rightmost). Parvati is depicted with green complexion, denoting dark complexion. After the marriage, Parvati moves to Mount Kailash, the residence of Shiva. To them are born Kartikeya (also known as Skanda and Murugan) – the leader of celestial armies, and Ganesha – the god of wisdom that prevents problems and removes obstacles.[11][57] There are many alternate Hindu legends about the birth of Parvati and how she married Shiva. In the Harivamsa, for example, Parvati has two younger sisters called Ekaparna and Ekapatala.[24] According to Devi Bhagavata Purana and Shiva Purana mount Himalaya and his wife Mena appease goddess Adi Parashakti. Pleased, Adi Parashakti herself is born as their daughter Parvati. Each major story about Parvati's birth and marriage to Shiva has regional variations, suggesting creative local adaptations. In another version of Shiva Purana, Chapters 17 through 52, cupid Kama is not involved, and instead, Shiva appears as a badly behaved, snake-wearing, dancing, disheveled beggar who Parvati gets attracted to, but who her parents disapprove of. The stories go through many ups and downs until Parvati and Shiva are finally married.[58] Kalidasa's epic Kumarasambhavam (""Birth of Kumara"") describes the story of the maiden Parvati who has made up her mind to marry Shiva and get him out of his recluse, intellectual, austere world of aloofness. Her devotions aimed at gaining the favor of Shiva, the subsequent annihilation of Kamadeva, the consequent fall of the universe into barren lifelessness, regeneration of life, the subsequent marriage of Parvati and Shiva, the birth of Kartikeya, and the eventual resurrection of Kamadeva after Parvati intercedes for him to Shiva. Parvati's legends are intrinsically related to Shiva. In the goddess-oriented Shakta texts, that she is said to transcend even Shiva, and is identified as the Supreme Being.[21] Just as Shiva is at once the presiding deity of destruction and regeneration, the couple jointly symbolize at once both the power of renunciation and asceticism and the blessings of marital felicity. Parvati thus symbolizes many different virtues esteemed by Hindu tradition: fertility, marital felicity, devotion to the spouse, asceticism, and power. Parvati represents the householder ideal in the perennial tension in Hinduism in the household ideal and the ascetic ideal, the later represented by Shiva.[46] Renunciation and asceticism is highly valued in Hinduism, as is householder's life – both feature as Ashramas of ethical and proper life. Shiva is portrayed in Hindu legends as the ideal ascetic withdrawn in his personal pursuit in the mountains with no interest in social life, while Parvati is portrayed as the ideal householder keen on nurturing worldly life and society.[54] Numerous chapters, stories, and legends revolve around their mutual devotion as well as disagreements, their debates on Hindu philosophy as well as the proper life. Parvati tames Shiva with her presence.[46] When Shiva does his violent, destructive Tandava dance, Parvati is described as calming him or complementing his violence by slow, creative steps of her own Lasya dance.[59] In many myths, Parvati is not as much his complement as his rival, tricking, seducing, or luring him away from his ascetic practices.[59] Shiva and Parvati as Uma-Maheshvara; 11th century sculpture. Three images are central to the mythology, iconography, and philosophy of Parvati: the image of Shiva-Shakti, the image of Shiva as Ardhanarishvara (the Lord who is half-woman), and the image of the linga and the yoni. These images that combine the masculine and feminine energies, Shiva and Parvati, yield a vision of reconciliation, interdependence, and harmony between the way of the ascetic and that of a householder.[60] The couple is often depicted in the Puranas as engaged in ""dalliance"" or seated on Mount Kailash debating concepts in Hindu theology. They are also depicted as quarreling.[61] In stories of the birth of Kartikeya, the couple is described as love-making; generating the seed of Shiva. Parvati's union with Shiva symbolizes the union of a male and female in ""ecstasy and sexual bliss"".[62] In art, Parvati is depicted seated on Shiva's knee or standing beside him (together the couple is referred to as Uma-Maheshvara or Hara-Gauri) or as Annapurna (the goddess of grain) giving alms to Shiva.[63] Shaiva's approaches tend to look upon Parvati as the Shiva's submissive and obedient wife. However, Shaktas focus on Parvati's equality or even superiority to her consort. The story of the birth of the ten Mahavidyas (Wisdom Goddesses) of Shakta Tantrism. This event occurs while Shiva is living with Parvati in her father's house. Following an argument, he attempts to walk out on her. Her rage at Shiva's attempt to walk out manifests in the form of ten terrifying goddesses who block Shiva's every exit. David Kinsley states, The fact that [Parvati] can physically restrain Shiva dramatically makes the point that she is superior in power. The theme of the superiority of the goddess over male deities is common in Shakta texts, [and] so the story is stressing a central Shakta theological principle. ... The fact that Shiva and Parvati are living in her father's house in itself makes this point, as it is traditional in many parts of India for the wife to leave her father's home upon marriage and become a part of her husband's lineage and live in his home among his relatives. That Shiva dwells in Parvati's house thus implies Her priority in their relationship. Her priority is also demonstrated in her ability, through the Mahavidyas, to thwart Shiva's will and assert her own.[64] Ardhanarishvara – the Hindu concept of an ideal couple as complementing union, inspired by Siva-Parvati. Ardhanarishvara in Elephanta Caves (left), and as an androgynous painting with one half Shiva, the other Parvati.[65] Ardhanarisvara Parvati is portrayed as the ideal wife, mother, and householder in Indian legends.[66] In Indian art, this vision of the ideal couple is derived from Shiva and Parvati as being half of the other, represented as Ardhanarisvara.[67] This concept is represented as an androgynous image that is half man and half woman, Siva and Parvati respectively.[65][68] Ideal wife, mother, and more In Hindu Epic the Mahabharata, she as Umā suggests that the duties of wife and mother are as follows – being of a good disposition, endued with sweet speech, sweet conduct, and sweet features. Her husband is her friend, refuge, and god.[69] She finds happiness in the physical, emotional nourishment and development of her husband and her children. Their happiness is her happiness. She is positive and cheerful even when her husband or her children are angry, she's with them in adversity or sickness.[69] She takes interest in worldly affairs, beyond her husband and family. She is cheerful and humble before family, friends, and relatives; helps them if she can. She welcomes guests, feeds them, and encourages righteous social life. Her family life and her home is her heaven, Parvati declares in Book 13 of the Mahabharata.[69] Rita Gross states,[9] that the view of Parvati only as ideal wife and mother is incomplete symbolism of the power of the feminine in the mythology of India. Parvati, along with other goddesses, is involved with a broad range of culturally valued goals and activities.[9] Her connection with motherhood and female sexuality does not confine the feminine or exhaust their significance and activities in Hindu literature. She is balanced by Durga, who is strong and capable without compromising her femaleness. She manifests in every activity, from water to mountains, from arts to inspiring warriors, from agriculture to dance. Parvati's numerous aspects state Gross,[9] reflects the Hindu belief that the feminine has a universal range of activities, and her gender is not a limiting condition. Parvati is seen as the mother of two widely worshipped deities — Ganesha and Kartikeya, as well as some other regional deities including a goddess named Ashokasundari. Ganesha Hindu literature, including the Matsya Purana, Shiva Purana, and Skanda Purana, dedicates many stories to Parvati and Shiva and their children.[70] For example, one about Ganesha is: Once, while Parvati wanted to take a bath, there were no attendants around to guard her and stop anyone from accidentally entering the house. Hence she created an image of a boy out of turmeric paste which she prepared to cleanse her body and infused life into it, and thus Ganesha was born. Parvati ordered Ganesha not to allow anyone to enter the house, and Ganesha obediently followed his mother's orders. After a while Shiva returned and tried to enter the house, Ganesha stopped him. Shiva was infuriated, lost his temper, and severed the boy's head with his trident. When Parvati came out and saw her son's lifeless body, she was very angry. She demanded that Shiva restore Ganesha's life at once. Shiva did so by attaching an elephant's head to Ganesha's body, thus giving rise to the elephant-headed deity.[71][72] Parvati in culture Festivals Teej festival Teej is a significant festival for Hindu women, particularly in the northern and western states of India. Parvati is the primary deity of the festival, and it ritually celebrates married life and family ties.[73] It also celebrates the monsoon. The festival is marked with swings hung from trees, girls playing on these swings typically in a green dress (seasonal color of crop planting season), while singing regional songs.[74] Historically, unmarried maidens prayed to Parvati for a good mate, while married women prayed for the well-being of their husbands and visited their relatives. In Nepal, Teej is a three-day festival marked with visits to Shiva-Parvati temples and offerings to linga.[73] Teej is celebrated as Teeyan in Punjab.[75] Gauri Festival Parvati being celebrated at Gauri Festival, Rajasthan. The Gowri Habba, or Gauri Festival, is celebrated on the seventh, eighth, and ninth of Bhadrapada (Shukla paksha). Parvati is worshipped as the goddess of harvest and protectress of women. Her festival, chiefly observed by women, is closely associated with the festival of her son Ganesha (Ganesh Chaturthi). The festival is popular in Maharashtra and Karnataka.[76] In Rajasthan, the worship of Gauri happens during the Gangaur festival. The festival starts on the first day of Chaitra the day after Holi and continues for 18 days. Images of Issar and Gauri are made from Clay for the festival. Navratri Another popular festival in reverence of Parvati is Navratri, in which all her manifestations are worshiped over nine days. Popular in eastern India, particularly in Bengal, Odisha, Jharkhand and Assam, as well as several other parts of India such as Gujarat, with her nine forms i.e. Shailaputri, Brahmacharini, Chandraghanta, Kushmanda, Skandamata, Katyayini, Kaalratri, Mahagauri, Siddhidatri.[77] Gauri Tritiya Another festival Gauri Tritiya is celebrated from Chaitra Shukla third to Vaishakha Shukla third. This festival is popular in Maharashtra and Karnataka, less observed in North India, and unknown in Bengal. The unwidowed women of the household erect a series of platforms in a pyramidal shape with the image of the goddess at the top and a collection of ornaments, images of other Hindu deities, pictures, shells, etc. below. Neighbors are invited and presented with turmeric, fruits, flowers, etc. as gifts. At night, prayers are held by singing and dancing. In south Indian states such as Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, the Kethara Gauri Vritham festival is celebrated on the new moon day of Diwali and married women fast for the day, prepare sweets and worship Parvati for the well-being of the family.[78] Thiruvathira Thiruvathira is a festival observed in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. It is believed that on this day, Parvathi met Lord Shiva after her long penance and Lord Shiva took her as his wife.[79] On this day Hindu women perform the Thiruvathirakali accompanied by Thiruvathira paattu (folk songs about Parvati and her longing and penance for Lord Shiva's affection).[80] Arts From sculpture to dance, many Indian arts explore and express the stories of Parvati and Shiva as themes. For example, Daksha Yagam of Kathakali, a form of dance-drama choreography, adapts the romantic episodes of Parvati and Shiva.[81] The Gauri-Shankar bead is a part of religious adornment rooted in the belief of Parvati and Shiva as the ideal equal complementing halves of the other. Gauri-Shankar is a particular rudraksha (bead) formed naturally from the seed of a tree found in India. Two seeds of this tree sometimes naturally grow as fused and are considered symbolic of Parvati and Shiva. These seeds are strung into garlands and worn, or used in malas (rosaries) for meditation in Saivism.[82] Numismatics Ancient coins from Bactria (Central Asia) of Kushan Empire era, and those of king Harsha (North India) feature Uma. These were issued sometime between the 3rd- and 7th-century AD. In Bactria, Uma is spelled Ommo, and she appears on coins holding a flower.[83][84] On her coin is also shown Shiva, who is sometimes shown in the ithyphallic state holding a trident and standing near Nandi (his vahana). On coins issued by king Harsha, Parvati and Shiva are seated on a bull and the reverse of the coin has Brahmi script.[85] Major temples See also: Shakti Peetha Meenakshi Amman temple in Madurai, Tamil Nadu is a major temple dedicated to Meenakshi, an aspect of Hindu goddess Parvati. Parvati is often present with Shiva in Saivite Hindu temples all over South Asia and Southeast Asia. Some locations (Pithas or Shaktipeeths) are considered special because of their historical importance and legends about their origins in the ancient texts of Hinduism.[86][87] Each major Parvati-Shiva temple is a pilgrimage site that has an ancient legend associated with it, which is typically a part of a larger story that links these Hindu temples across South Asia with each other. List of temples Some temples where Parvati can be found include: in Andhra Pradesh: Maanikyambika Bhimeswara Temple in Kerala:Annapurneshwari Temple, Cherukunnu, Attukal Bhagavathy Temple, Chakkulathukavu Temple, Chengannur Mahadeva Temple, Oorpazhachi Kavu, Irumkulangara Durga Devi Temple, Valiya Kavu Sree Parvathi Devi Temple, Sri Kiratha Parvathi Temple Paramelpadi, Korechal Kirathaparvathi Temple, Nedukavu Parvathy Devi Temple, Karthyayani Devi Temple, Varanad Devi Temple, Veluthattu Vadakkan Chowa Temple, Thiruvairanikulam Mahadeva Temple, Ardhanariswara Temple and Kadampuzha Devi Temple in Madhya Pradesh: Parvati Temple in Maharashtra: Tulja Bhavani Temple in Meghalaya: Nartiang Durga Temple in Tamil Nadu: Meenakshi Amman Temple, Kamakshi Amman Temple, Sri Siva Durga Temple, Thirukkadaiyur Abirami Amman temple, Thirumeyachur Lalithambigai temple, Bannari Amman Temple, Samayapuram Mariamman Temple, Thiruvanaikaval Akilandeswari temple, Thiruvalangadu Kali temple, Vekkali Amman Temple, Mutharamman Temple, Kulasekharapatnam, Tiruverkadu Devi Karumariamman Temple, Nellaiappar Temple, Kapaleeshwarar Temple, Masani Ammam temple, Mandaikadu Bhagavathi temple, Gomathi Amman, Punnainallur Mariamman, Devi Kanya Kumari temple in Tripura: Tripura Sundari Templein Tripura: Tripura Sundari Temple in Uttar Pradesh: Vishalakshi Temple, Vishalakshi Gauri Temple and Annapurna Devi Temple Outside India Parvati as Uma or Durga sculpture are found in Southeast Asia. An 8th century Parvati from Cambodia (left), a 10th century Uma from Champa Vietnam (center), and a 14th century Parvati from Majapahit Java (right). Sculpture and iconography of Parvati, in one of her many manifestations, have been found in temples and literature of Southeast Asia. For example, early Saivite inscriptions of the Khmer in Cambodia, dated as early as the fifth century AD, mention Parvati (Uma) and Siva.[88] Many ancient and medieval era Cambodian temples, rock arts and river bed carvings such as the Kbal Spean are dedicated to Parvati and Shiva.[89][90] Boisselier has identified Uma in a Champa era temple in Vietnam.[91] Dozens of ancient temples dedicated to Parvati as Uma, with Siva, have been found in the islands of Indonesia and Malaysia. Her manifestation as Durga has also been found in southeast Asia.[92] Many of the temples in Java dedicated to Siva-Parvati are from the second half of 1st millennium AD, and some from later centuries.[93] Durga icons and worship have been dated to be from the 10th- to 13th-century.[94] Pillar temple with offerings to Dewi Sri. She is variously interpreted as Parvati or as Lakshmi.[95][96] Derived from Parvati's form as Mahakali, her nipponized form is Daikokutennyo (大黒天女). In Nakhorn Si Thammarat province of Thailand, excavations at Dev Sathan have yielded a Hindu Temple dedicated to Vishnu (Na Pra Narai), a lingam in the yoni, a Shiva temple (San Pra Isuan). The sculpture of Parvati found at this excavation site reflects the South Indian style.[97][98] Bali, Indonesia Parvati, locally spelled as Parwati, is a principal goddess in modern-day Hinduism of Bali. She is more often called Uma, and sometimes referred to as Giriputri (daughter of the mountains).[99] She is the goddess of mountain Gunung Agung.[100] Like Hinduism of India, Uma has many manifestations in Bali, Indonesia. She is the wife of deity Siwa. Uma or Parwati is considered as the mother goddess that nurtures, nourishes, grants fertility to crop and all life. As Dewi Danu, she presides over waters, lake Batur and Gunung Batur, a major volcano in Bali. Her ferocious form in Bali is Dewi Durga.[101] As Rangda, she is wrathful and presides cemeteries.[100] As Ibu Pertiwi, Parwati of Balinese Hinduism is the goddess of earth.[100] The legends about various manifestations of Parwati, and how she changes from one form to another, are in Balinese literature, such as the palm-leaf (lontar) manuscript Andabhuana.[102] Related goddesses Part of a series onShaktism Deities Mahadevi (Supreme) Shiva-Shakti Parvati Durga Mahavidya Kali Lalita Matrikas Lakshmi Saraswati More Scriptures and texts Vedas Tantras Yogini Shakta Upanishads Devi Sita Tripura Devi Bhagavatam Devi Mahatmyam Lalita Sahasranama Tripura Rahasya Kalika Purana other texts Saundarya Lahari Annada Mangal Ramprasadi Abhirami Anthadhi Schools Vidya margam Vamachara Dakshinachara Kula margam Srikulam Kalikulam Trika Kubjikamata Scholars Bharatchandra Ray Bhaskararaya Krishnananda Agamavagisha Ramprasad Sen Ramakrishna Abhirami Bhattar Practices Yoga Yoni Kundalini Panchamakara Tantra Yantra Festivals and temples Navaratri Durga Puja Lakshmi Puja Kali Puja Saraswati Puja Teej Shakti Peetha Hinduism portalvte Tara found in some sects of Buddhism, particularly Tibetan and Nepalese, is related to Parvati.[103][104] Tara too appears in many manifestations. In tantric sects of Buddhism, as well as Hinduism, intricate symmetrical art forms of yantra or mandala are dedicated to different aspects of Tara and Parvati.[105][106] Parvati is closely related in symbolism and powers to Cybele of Greek and Roman mythology and as Vesta the guardian goddess of children.[11][107] In her manifestation as Durga, Parvati parallels Mater Montana.[11] She is the equivalent of the Magna Mater (Universal Mother).[19] As Kali and punisher of all evil, she corresponds to Proserpine and Diana Taurica.[108] As Bhawani and goddess of fertility and birthing, she is the symbolic equivalent of Ephesian Diana.[108] In Crete, Rhea is the mythological figure, goddess of the mountains, paralleling Parvati; while in some mythologies from islands of Greece, the terrifying goddess mirroring Parvati is Diktynna (also called Britomartis).[109] At Ephesus, Cybele is shown with lions, just like the iconography of Parvati is sometimes shown with a lion.[109] Carl Jung, in Mysterium Coniunctionis, states that aspects of Parvati belong to the same category of goddesses like Artemis, Isis and Mary.[110][111] Edmund Leach equates Parvati in her relationship with Shiva, with that of the Greek goddess Aphrodite – a symbol of sexual love.[112] Notes Part of a series onSaivism DeitiesParamasiva(Supreme being) Shiva Sadasiva Bhairava Rudra Virabhadra Shakti Parvati Sati Durga Kali Ganesha Murugan Sastha Shiva forms Others Scriptures and texts Vedas Agama-Tantras Shivasutras Tirumurai Vachanas Svetasvatara Philosophy Three Components Pati Pashu Pasam Three bondages Anava Karma Maya other aspects 36 Tattvas Yoga Satkaryavada Abhasavada Svatantrya Aham Practices Vibhuti Rudraksha Panchakshara Bilva Maha Shivaratri Yamas-Niyamas Guru-Linga-Jangam Schools Adi Margam Pashupata Kalamukha Kapalika Mantra Margam Saiddhantika Siddhantism Non - Saiddhantika Kashmir Shaivism Pratyabhijna Vama Dakshina Kaula: Trika-Yamala-Kubjika-Netra Others Nath Inchegeri Veerashaiva/Lingayatism Siddharism Sroutaism Aghori Indonesian Scholars Lakulisha Abhinavagupta Vasugupta Utpaladeva Nayanars Manikkavacakar Meykandar Nirartha Basava Sharana Srikantha Appayya Navnath Related Nandi Tantrism Bhakti Jyotirlinga Shiva Temples Hinduism portalvte ^ a b James D.

44,"Tokyo International Communication Committee PBV President Takashi Yamamoto. This month's Close Up features the Peace Boat Disaster Relief Volunteer Center (PBV), an organization registered as a general incorporated association. PBV was established by Peace Boat in the wake of the Great East Japan Earthquake; the parent entity itself being a non-governmental organization (NGO) that promotes international exchanges and communication, it being well-known for its ""international exchange and communication cruises."" In inheriting the Peace Boat belief of ""borderless disaster relief and support that contributes to peace around the world and within its different regions,"" by going beyond simply dispatching volunteers to devastated areas, PBV aims to develop new systems for disaster relief volunteers while continuing its activities. On this occasion, we spoke to PBV President Takashi Yamamoto about the organization's disaster relief and support activities in response to the Great East Japan Earthquake. We also spoke to him regarding the potential that disaster relief volunteers offer. Please tell us how and why PBV was established. The PBV offices. What led Peace Boat to get involved in disaster relief and support was the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake of 1995. Originally, Peace Boat was not an NGO that conducted emergency disaster relief and support activities. However, in the wake of the aforementioned disaster, it engaged in its first relief and support activities for a period of about three months, the location being Nagata Ward in Kobe City. Actually, I should mention that I am originally from Nishinomiya City in Hyogo Prefecture, thus my family home was partially destroyed in the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake. I remember wondering at the time if there was something that Peace Boat should be doing in response to the unfolding events. Following on from Peace Boat experiences dealing with the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake, the organization conducted disaster relief and support activities around the world, responding to events such as major earthquakes in Turkey, the impact of earthquakes off Sumatra on the island of Sri Lanka, and Hurricane Katrina in the United States, etc. Speaking more specifically about the Great East Japan Earthquake, Peace Boat representatives entered Ishinomaki City in Miyagi Prefecture some six days after the quake, carrying our first relief supplies of blankets, etc. Once there, however, it was apparent that there were simply not enough materials or people to cope. As somebody experienced in disaster relief and support activities, the situation confronting us in Ishinomaki was the worst I have ever seen. We realized it would be necessary for relief and support activities to be undertaken on a significant scale. It was such circumstances that led Peace Boat to establish a separate entity called ""Peace Boat Disaster Relief Volunteer Center,"" in order to offer as much long-term support as possible. So in response to the disaster you immediately called for volunteers? The first volunteer orientation session conducted on March 23rd, 2011. ©Peace Boat Disaster Relief Volunteer Center (PBV) From just after the Great East Japan Earthquake through until around the Golden Week holiday, it was said that ""it was still too early for volunteers to go"" to the devastated areas. However, after we reached the region on March 17th, we did not feel that this argument was valid. For Peace Boat, an organization that has conducted ship cruises of international exchange and communication, there is the basic belief that social problems can be resolved and international understanding deepened via activities that seek to move people. For us, people are helped by others going to them and pitching in. In such circumstances, we felt the most important issue was establishing what potential volunteers could offer. Thus, we quickly made a decision to gather together volunteers who could be dispatched to Ishinomaki. Accordingly our first orientation session was held on March 23rd at the Peace Boat offices in Takadanobaba. We only called for volunteers via social media channels over a period of three days. However, we managed to attract more than 300 people interested in volunteering to our first orientation session. What matters were of concern in the dispatching of volunteers? As might be expected, early on conditions in the devastated areas were quite severe. Thus, we took a rather cautious approach in our dispatch of clearly-defined volunteer groups, going so far as to create a number of precautions to ensure that we did not place a drain on local resources in the devastated areas, nor cause any inconvenience through our presence. Against the wider undercurrent that said volunteers should not go to the devastated areas, if by our sending groups their presence resulted even in the slightest criticism, any benefit offered by our volunteers would quickly dissipate. Thus, we clarified responsibilities within our organization by having our Tokyo office responsible for receiving potential volunteers and orientating them. Meanwhile, our assets in Ishinomaki were responsible for the organization and management of our volunteers in the devastated areas. Volunteers equipped with food, tents, sleeping bags, and cold weather gear, etc., getting on a bus to Ishinomaki. ©Peace Boat Disaster Relief Volunteer Center (PBV) Concerning the volunteers, what factors were you particularly mindful of? Volunteers handling relief supplies. ©Peace Boat Disaster Relief Volunteer Center (PBV) In that there were prohibitions on alcohol consumption and volunteers were expected to gather in the morning to help clean up around our operational headquarters, I suppose that in some respects we were rather strict. However, we were not in the position of exercising command over our volunteers. Thus, concerning volunteer attitudes and precautions taken, etc., we had our volunteers engage in activities based on their clear understanding and agreement of what was occurring. As such, we were very careful to instill a sense of accountability among our volunteers. And you also emphasized safety among your volunteers? In actual fact it was the foreign volunteer who first picked up on the safety issue. We were advised that if nothing was done, sooner or later accidents would occur. We were introduced to an Australian rescue specialist who had worked with Japanese fire brigade and police units. This gentleman kindly created an English language safety manual for relief volunteers which we translated into Japanese and then used. There were a lot of volunteers for whom working in a disaster zone was something completely new. Thus, the issue we placed the greatest emphasis upon was that volunteers were able to ensure their own safety. Would one distinguishing feature of the Great East Japan Earthquake be the number of foreign volunteers who responded to the disaster? If you think of Japan's past disasters, perhaps this time was the first for us to experience both so many foreign volunteers and so much support coming from overseas. In the case of PBV, we also publish information in English, and for the Great East Japan Earthquake, we did not just see volunteers coming from the foreign community here in Japan, rather people also hastily decided to come from overseas. In a situation where it was even difficult for Japanese people to grasp what was happening, I must admit that initially I was also worried about non-Japanese speakers going to the devastated areas. That being said, however, because we felt we could leverage the strong motivation of such people who were willing to volunteer in a strange country, PBV developed processes that allowed us to proactively engage foreign volunteers. In terms of overcoming language issues, I feel it was significant that Peace Boat has volunteer interpreters and instructors who teach English conversation programs on Peace Boat cruises, etc. Because it was easy for us to gather together such people proficient in languages, it was rather easy to accept foreign volunteers without being overly concerned about language issues. By adopting the approach of assigning volunteer interpreters to each of our teams, in 2011 alone we were able to welcome volunteers from some 52 different countries and regions. International volunteer teams. A volunteer team from Sri Lanka. ©Peace Boat Disaster Relief Volunteer Center (PBV) Would another distinctive feature of the Great East Japan Earthquake be that businesses also dispatched volunteers? Volunteers on the way to work. ©Peace Boat Disaster Relief Volunteer Center (PBV) Up until now, when disasters have occurred businesses have come forward with both monetary donations and the provision of relief supplies. However, in most instances the Great East Japan Earthquake represented the first occasion for many businesses to go so far as to dispatch their own employees as volunteers. One contributing factor to such a turn of events is a stronger interest among business towards corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices. Indeed, there were a number of ways in which businesses dispatched their volunteers. Some dispatched them in connection with the business interests of individual companies, while others recruited volunteers from within their ranks and dispatched them in accordance with employee-leave provisions designed to encourage participation in volunteer activities, etc. Depending on the business, I felt there was significant potential offered by the dispatch of volunteers. That being said, however, rather than companies dispatching volunteers due to monetary contributions being made to relief efforts of hundreds of millions of yen, I feel it is very important that employees go to devastated areas due to a personal desire to contribute to relief efforts. And I have heard that you have commenced a development program for disaster relief volunteers? For the Great East Japan Earthquake, the major factor that prevented more volunteers being accepted for work in the devastated areas was a profound lack of on-site leader numbers. Thus, in preparing for future disasters, to a certain extent we have to develop leaders who can manage people, such resources being necessary to increase our capacity to accept volunteers. For this reason we have commenced a disaster relief volunteer leadership program. Furthermore, volunteer leadership is not just a domestic issue for Japan. This was borne out by our experiences with Hurricane Sandy in the northeastern United States at the end of last year. When PBV dispatched bilingual staff and leaders in response to Hurricane Sandy, responders in the United States happily welcomed our contribution because they had struggled to manage the number of people who wished to volunteer. For the purpose of further increasing the potential of international disaster relief volunteers, we feel that it is important that steps be taken so that leadership training etc., can be offered in many more languages. Scenes from PBV leadership training. ©Peace Boat Disaster Relief Volunteer Center (PBV) Please tell us about your vision of the future? Volunteers engaged in removing sludge and cleaning up. ©Peace Boat Disaster Relief Volunteer Center (PBV) Based on our experiences in Ishinomaki, I feel that it has been proven that if volunteers are well-organized, they represent an extremely valuable human resource. For example, when clearing sludge from individual homes and stores, such activities represent help being given to specific individuals. As such, these are not activities that military units or local governments can readily engage in. When asked who should pitch in and help in such circumstances, the only people in a position to respond are volunteers. Concerning what volunteers can do and their potential, the range of possible tasks far exceeds what everybody imagines. In order to maximize this potential, efforts must be made to learn how volunteers are best organized. From the global perspective, moreover, it is only in Japan that volunteers play such significant roles in disaster relief and support. When disasters occur, only Japan has the systems in place that allow local government social welfare councils to establish ""disaster relief volunteer centers."" Both as a Japanese organization that benefitted greatly from the wide variety of support forthcoming from overseas after the Great East Japan Earthquake, and also as a single Japanese person; I feel it important that the lessons we have learned in this disaster be disseminated globally. Please give a final message to our readers. In addition to helping an individual ensure their own safety, acquiring basic disaster relief volunteer knowledge and techniques prepares them mentally. This gives the individual the confidence required to help others if and when disasters occur. At PBV we offer introductory courses for disaster relief volunteers as well as formal qualifications, etc. I heartily encourage everybody to try these courses because when something unexpected happens, it is very important to know how to react appropriately. ©2011 TOKYO INTERNATIONAL COMMUNICATION COMMITTEE",Peace Boat Disaster Relief Volunteer Center

READ MORE Global Voyage for a Nuclear-Free World: Peace Boat Hibakusha Project Since 2008, Japan-based international NGO Peace Boat has invited Hibakusha (atomic bomb survivors) of Hiroshima and Nagasaki to participate in the “Global Voyage for a Nuclear-Free World: Peace Boat Hibakusha Project.” As of 2014, over 150 Hibakusha have travelled around the world giving personal testimonies about the effects of the atomic bombs and calling for nuclear abolition. The messages from Hiroshima and Nagasaki have the potential to deeply move people around the world who are affected by war, violence, poverty and environmental issues. This project is held annually onboard Peace Boat’s global voyages. As the average age of the Hibakusha is now close to 79 years old, the time remaining for them to directly send out their urgent message is very limited.

Maintaining a healthy environment, a stable climate and prosperous communities requires collaboration, evidence-based decision making and innovative solutions. That’s what the Pembina Institute is about. The Pembina Institute is working to solve today’s greatest energy challenges — reducing the harmful impacts of fossil fuels while supporting the transition to an energy system that is clean, safe and sustains a high quality of life. We provide our expertise to industry and government leaders, and we advocate for a strong, science-based approach to policy, regulation, environmental protection and energy development. It’s time to transition to cleaner energy systems. What we do As Canada’s go-to source of energy expertise, we provide research, analysis and recommendations to inform policies and practices related to energy. We advocate for approaches that protect our natural systems and communities. We convene important conversations with thought leaders from industry, government, communities and the environmental sector to identify common ground and move solutions forward. We present credible and practical perspectives on the role of energy in our society. We ground Canada’s energy conversation in the facts, and we challenge conventional thinking with innovative solutions. Our guiding principles Mission To advance a prosperous clean energy future for Canada through credible policy solutions that support communities, the economy and a safe climate. Vision The Pembina Institute envisions a world in which our needs are met in ways that protect natural ecosystems; ensure clean air, land and water; stop contributing to climate change; and promote a just global community. Statement of our core values Climate change threatens everyone. We must come together to evolve how energy is created and consumed through solutions based on equity, curiosity, evidence-based thinking and practicality. Equal by 30 The Pembina Institute is pleased to be a signatory of Natural Resources Canada’s Equal by 30 campaign, a public commitment to work towards equal pay, equal leadership and equal opportunities for women in the clean energy sector by 2030. When we think about Canada’s clean energy transition, we need to make sure that the transformation happens in a way that is not only innovative and capable of meeting society’s need for energy, but also considers equity. Read more about our commitments here. Our path towards Reconciliation and prioritizing Indigenous leadership For nearly 35 years, the Pembina Institute has worked with industry and all levels of government, including Indigenous governments, to help build a clean energy future that protects our climate, and the cities and communities we live in. Equity is one of the Institute’s core values and we believe that good climate and energy policy must also be good community policy. Yet we realize an increased effort is necessary on our part to truly live out these values. This is especially evident when we consider how our work as a national organization on the front lines of climate change is impacting Indigenous Peoples in what is now called Canada. Read more Indigenous communities in Canada — especially those in remote and Northern regions — are extremely vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and are already experiencing negative impacts to their land, culture and way of life as a result of these changes. Two centuries of colonial policies, laws and suppression of Indigenous Peoples have created the ugly realities of intergenerational trauma and racism that continue to overpower Indigenous voices and rights. In our work to reduce carbon emissions and pollution to the land, water, and air, we believe in taking a pragmatic, evidence-based approach to advancing effective policies and regulations. We advocate for solutions that build resilient, healthy communities and provide a just transition away from fossil fuels. We recognize that Reconciliation efforts with Indigenous Peoples are vital to healing the past so we can work together to ensure a healthy future for the land and all living beings. We must also acknowledge that we are still a largely non-Indigenous organization, and enhance our understanding of what role we need to play in supporting leadership, sharing our policy expertise, and upholding the principles and frameworks of reconciliation so we can move further towards positive, inclusive, and effective action. Thanks to strong voices of Indigenous leadership asking all of us to address and confront our shared history, there is a renewed momentum in Canada towards the notions of reconciliation and decolonization, encouraged in part by the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People (UNDRIP), and Canada’s Calls to Action of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC). As a result of these works, awareness among Canadians has increased over recent years, and in parallel we are witnessing a strong resurgence of Indigenous voice, culture and leadership. In addition, the Government of British Columbia recently tabled a bill on Indigenous rights. Once passed, the province will be the first in Canada to legally implement UNDRIP into law. Many of these Indigenous leaders and champions are now taking bold steps to place themselves at the forefront of climate action, and to power their communities with renewable, local energy sources. There is much that all Canadians can learn from the wisdom, experience and momentum being demonstrated in Indigenous communities, which have existed sustainably on the land we call home for thousands of years. In order for us to successfully transition to a clean economy, we must look to the Indigenous community for leadership and guidance. We have worked with Indigenous communities throughout our history, supporting energy literacy, capacity building, energy efficiency and renewable energy projects. Moving forward, our work is becoming more focused on encouraging policies that strengthen local clean energy initiatives, shift colonial policies and practices that restrict self-determination in Indigenous communities, and support energy autonomy in these communities. This will be a long journey, but we are taking the first steps. We are currently in the second phase of our efforts over the past year to advance our own reconciliation process. Our Reconciliation Working Group, in collaboration with our Indigenous strategist, is developing a Reconciliation Action Plan for the organization, working closely with our staff and board of directors. We will continue to listen, engage and deepen relationships with Indigenous communities on the energy issues we work on. We will take direction from guiding documents such as UNDRIP and the TRC Principles of Truth and Reconciliation, as well as from Indigenous Peoples and communities that we work directly with. We will strive to be in right relations with First Nations, Inuit and Métis in this country, and ensure our focus on climate and energy incorporates Indigenous rights and issues into our processes and strategic thinking. Ultimately, recognizing the critical role and placement Indigenous People have in our shared history and future, we aim to make the Pembina Institute a strong and beneficial voice of allyship with Indigenous Peoples as Canada continues its path towards a clean energy future. Where we come from Three decades ago, the Pembina Institute was formed following a major sour gas incident in Alberta. The Lodgepole blowout killed two people and polluted the air for weeks. The event was largely the result of poorly regulated energy development. In response, a small group of rural Albertans came together to secure tougher regulations for drilling sour gas wells. Those regulations were implemented province-wide. The core members of that group went on to form the Pembina Institute. Since then, our work has expanded outside Alberta, but our focus remains the same: We push industries and governments to go beyond the bare minimum to manage the impacts of energy development, and we advocate for those improvements to be embedded in provincial and federal policy. Learn more about our 30-year journey. Where we work Our staff work on regional energy priorities and major national energy-related issues. Alberta Founded in Drayton Valley following the 1982 Amoco Lodgepole sour gas blowout, the Pembina Institute knows Alberta. We understand the province’s unique energy challenges: Alberta has Canada’s largest conventional and unconventional oil and gas reserves, and it also relies on coal to produce the majority of its electricity. As a result, Alberta pumps out more carbon pollution than any other province in Canada. Our work in Alberta aims to change that. We advocate for science-based limits on fossil fuel development, and replacing coal-fired power with clean renewable electricity. With world-class wind, solar and geothermal resources, Alberta has the potential to lead the nation in renewable energy generation. Alberta is the first province to have put a price on carbon pollution. The money collected through this carbon price or levy feeds a technology fund, but this approach has room for improvement. More of that fund could be used for development of renewable power, including within the oil and gas sector. Opportunities to increase energy efficiency in the province are also plentiful — in fact, our research shows that investing in energy efficiency could save the province $29 billion and 176 Mt of carbon pollution in 15 years. We are also a founding member of the Alberta Energy Efficiency Alliance. British Columbia British Columbia has taken significant steps in the transition to cleaner energy. The province combines innovative building solutions with an advanced clean energy technology sector and world-class climate policies. But B.C. is at a crossroad. Pursuing a liquefied natural gas (LNG) industry has the potential to drastically increase B.C.’s carbon pollution with significant implications for clean land, air and water. Our work in B.C. explores solutions that can help the province remain an economically competitive climate leader. For LNG this means encouraging responsible development that considers the big picture: from wells to waterline and beyond. The outreach we do on innovative building solutions strives to develop standards that will make B.C. home to the cleanest building industry in North America. The carbon pricing work we undertake seeks to expose the benefits of B.C.’s world-renowned carbon tax. Our clean energy technology research encourages robust development of the sector in B.C. for domestic use and export. Ontario As the first province to phase out coal-fired power, Ontario has shown great leadership on reducing carbon pollution. Wind, solar and biomass-fuelled electricity now increasingly contribute to the province’s grid. However, as Ontario’s population grows, transportation has become the province’s largest and fastest-growing source of carbon pollution. Without the appropriate policies in place, many cities in Ontario will continue to sprawl while their roads and highways become more and more congested. This has serious implications for clean air and climate change. In Greater Toronto, the Pembina Institute is investigating new and innovative policies that encourage location-efficient development, where residents can walk or cycle to workplaces, amenities and rapid transit, rather than depending on a car. This will give people the choice to live closer to where they work and play. National Many of the regional energy priorities we work on also have a national component — particularly when local or regional outcomes are influenced by federal policies and regulations, or when one region’s experiences could offer important insight into solutions for other cities, provinces or the country as a whole. We aim to leverage regional successes to help other jurisdictions across Canada transition to cleaner energy. Promoting the shift to an energy system that meets the needs and desires of Canadians without compromising a safe and healthy environment is important to us. We also advocate for federal laws and regulations that reduce the negative impacts of fossil fuel development. At the Pembina Institute we are working to build an energy system that protects our climate and our communities — one that Canadians can be proud of. Help us make it happen!

Founded in 1985, the institute has offices in Calgary, Edmonton, Toronto, Ottawa and Vancouver.The institute's mission is to ""advance a prosperous clean energy future for Canada through credible policy solutions that support communities, the economy and a safe climate.""[1] Contents 1 Origin 2 Policies 3 Initiatives 4 Intervener standing 5 Funding 6 References 7 External links Origin[edit] The Pembina Institute was formed following the 1981 Lodgepole sour gas accident in Alberta, which killed two people and polluted the air for weeks. A small group of rural Albertans came together to secure tougher regulations for drilling sour gas wells, and later went on to form the Pembina Institute.[2] Policies[edit] The Pembina Institute advocates policies that reduce the use of fossil fuels, and supports the transition to cleaner energy sources.[3] The institute’s current work is regionally focused. In Alberta they call for restricting energy development (conventional and unconventional oil and gas as well as oilsands) to limits supported by science. They promote renewable energy sources including wind and solar, and advocate shutting down coal-fired electricity plants. They support energy efficiency policies and actions in communities and businesses, and improved building efficiency. They have called for expanding transit infrastructure and limiting urban sprawl in the Greater Toronto Area. They have supported the carbon tax in British Columbia and in Alberta, and called for stronger climate action from the Canadian federal government, including action on reducing methane emissions.[4] They have analyzed the impact of freight emissions on Paris Accord targets, stating that the targets will not be met if freight transportation is not made more efficient.[5] Initiatives[edit] The Pembina Institute was also involved in the ""Renewable is Doable""[6] initiative with WWF-Canada to replace coal and nuclear power with clean energy sources. The institute is a member of the Alberta Energy Efficiency Alliance.[7] It is also a supporting member of the Strathmere group, an assembly of the heads of eleven of Canada’s leading environmental organizations.[8] The institute’s educational initiatives were moved to an independent organization, Green Learning Canada, in 2011. Intervener standing[edit] In 2012, Alberta Environment and Sustainable Resource Development denied the institute standing to express concerns about an in situ oilsands project near Fort McMurray, Alberta. The decision was appealed, and on October 1, 2013, the decision was overturned by the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench.[9][10] Funding[edit] The Pembina Institute is primarily funded by a range of project-specific grants, event sponsorships (including those from energy companies such as Suncor, Shell and Bullfrog Power)[11] and individual donations. The Institute also performs fee-for-service research and advising to government and industry.

On January 1, 2019, the Pembina Institute for Appropriate Development and the Pembina Foundation for Environmental Research and Education merged into a single organization, pursuant to the Canada Not-for-profit Corporations Act. We will continue to operate as the Pembina Institute and are excited for the operational and administrative efficiencies expected from this change. We will continue to carry out our well-reasoned and non-partisan policy advocacy as a federally registered charity. Financials The majority of our revenue is program-specific and comes from project grants, gifts, and partnership agreements. We do not receive direct core funding (i.e., to cover administration or operations) from any source. Detailed information is available each year in our annual financial reports. Since our beginning, the Pembina Institute has been committed to working with all levels of government (federal, provincial and municipal), the energy industry, communities and academia to help move Canada towards a diversified energy future that delivers economic prosperity, environmental protection and climate security. We’re proud of our work and our ability to attract support that delivers real results to help Canada move towards a prosperous low-carbon future. Since 2006, approximately 85% of our funding has come from Canadian foundations, industry, individuals, and all levels of government. The remainder of our funding is from international grantees. Energy and climate issues are global in scope, and it's only natural that they attract global cooperation and support to work towards solutions. International support, similar to our Canadian support, goes to all of our work across the country — including carbon pricing, responsible oil and gas, buildings, electricity and transportation. Our oil and gas work has always been focused on responsible development. We believe that a lower-carbon oil industry is a competitive one, and we work towards solutions that ensure the oil industry thrives in an increasingly lower-carbon world. The Pembina Institute’s research on the oilsands has always focused on compiling the best data on impacts management and policy solutions. By being a fair and constructive critic, we have helped improve the environmental performance of the industry to the benefit of all Canadians.

English is the official language of the province. In 2016, 76.0% of Albertans were anglophone, 1.8% were francophone and 22.2% were allophone.[8] Alberta is bordered by British Columbia to the west, Saskatchewan to the east, the Northwest Territories (NWT) to the north, and the U.S. state of Montana to the south. It is one of the only two landlocked provinces in Canada.[7] The eastern part of the province is occupied by the Great Plains, while the western part borders the Rocky Mountains. The province has a predominantly continental climate but experiences quick temperature changes due to air aridity. Seasonal temperature swings are less pronounced in western Alberta due to occasional chinook winds.[9] Alberta is the 6th largest province by area, being approximately 660,000 square kilometers,[10] and the 4th most populous, being home to 4,067,175 people.[1] Alberta's capital is Edmonton, while Calgary is its largest city.[11] The two are Alberta's largest census metropolitan areas (CMAs) and both exceed 1 million people.[12] More than half of Albertans live in either Edmonton or Calgary, which contributes to continuing the rivalry between the two cities. The province also has one other CMA, Lethbridge, and 15 census agglomerations.[12] The oil and gas industry is also a part of the province's identity. Alberta's economy is based on hydrocarbons, petrochemical industries, livestock, agriculture and frontier technologies.[13] The oil industry has been a pillar of Alberta's economy since 1947, when substantial oil deposits were discovered at Leduc No. 1 well.[14] Since Alberta is the province most rich in hydrocarbons, it provides 70% of the oil and natural gas exploited on Canadian soil. In 2018, Alberta's output was CDN$338.2 billion, 15.27% of Canada's GDP.[15][16] In the past, Alberta's political landscape hosted parties like the left-wing Liberals and the agrarian United Farmers of Alberta, as well as the right-wing Social Credit Party and the Progressive Conservatives. Today, Alberta is generally perceived as a conservative province. The longest political dynasty in Canada was held by the Progressive Conservatives from 1971 to 2015. Before becoming part of Canada, Alberta was home to several First Nations and was a territory used by fur traders of the Hudson's Bay Company. The lands that would become Alberta were acquired by Canada as part of the NWT on July 15, 1870.[17] On September 1, 1905, Alberta was separated from the NWT as a result of the Alberta Act and designated the 8th province of Canada.[18] From the late 1800s to early 1900s, many immigrants arrived, the biggest wave of which was pushed by Wilfrid Laurier, to prevent the prairies from being annexed by Americans. Massive oil resources were discovered in Alberta in 1947.[19] Alberta is renowned for its natural beauty, richness in fossils and for housing important nature reserves. Alberta is home to six UNESCO World Heritage Sites: The Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks, Dinosaur Provincial Park, the Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump, Waterton–Glacier International Peace Park, Wood Buffalo National Park and Writing-on-Stone Provincial Park.[20] Other popular sites include: Banff, Canmore, Drumheller, Jasper, Sylvan Lake and Lake Louise.

Princess Louise was the wife of John Campbell, Marquess of Lorne, Governor General of Canada (1878–83). Lake Louise and Mount Alberta were also named in her honour.[22][23] The name ""Alberta"" itself is a feminine Latinized form of Albert, the name of Princess Louise's father, the Prince Consort (cf. Medieval Latin: Albertus, masculine) and its Germanic cognates, ultimately derived from Proto-Germanic *Aþalaberhtaz (compound of ""noble"" + ""bright/famous"").[24][25] Geography[edit] Main article: Geography of Alberta A topographic map of Alberta, showing cities, towns, municipal district (county) and rural municipality borders, and natural features Alberta, with an area of 661,848 km2 (255,500 sq mi), is the fourth-largest province after Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia.[26] Alberta's southern border is the 49th parallel north, which separates it from the U.S. state of Montana. The 60th parallel north divides Alberta from the Northwest Territories. The 110th meridian west separates it from the province of Saskatchewan; while on the west its boundary with British Columbia follows the 120th meridian west south from the Northwest Territories at 60°N until it reaches the Continental Divide at the Rocky Mountains, and from that point follows the line of peaks marking the Continental Divide in a generally southeasterly direction until it reaches the Montana border at 49°N.[27] The province extends 1,223 km (760 mi) north to south and 660 km (410 mi) east to west at its maximum width. Its highest point is 3,747 m (12,293 ft) at the summit of Mount Columbia in the Rocky Mountains along the southwest border while its lowest point is 152 m (499 ft) on the Slave River in Wood Buffalo National Park in the northeast.[28] With the exception of the semi-arid steppe of the south-eastern section, the province has adequate water resources. There are numerous rivers and lakes used for swimming, fishing and a range of water sports. There are three large lakes, Lake Claire (1,436 km2 (554 sq mi)) in Wood Buffalo National Park, Lesser Slave Lake (1,168 km2 (451 sq mi)), and Lake Athabasca (7,898 square kilometres (3,049 sq mi)) which lies in both Alberta and Saskatchewan. The longest river in the province is the Athabasca River which travels 1,538 km (956 mi) from the Columbia Icefield in the Rocky Mountains to Lake Athabasca.[29] The largest river is the Peace River with an average flow of 2161 m3/s. The Peace River originates in the Rocky Mountains of northern British Columbia and flows through northern Alberta and into the Slave River, a tributary of the Mackenzie River. Alberta's capital city, Edmonton, is located at about the geographic centre of the province. It is the most northerly major city in Canada, and serves as a gateway and hub for resource development in northern Canada. The region, with its proximity to Canada's largest oil fields, has most of western Canada's oil refinery capacity. Calgary is about 280 km (170 mi) south of Edmonton and 240 km (150 mi) north of Montana, surrounded by extensive ranching country. Almost 75% of the province's population lives in the Calgary–Edmonton Corridor. The land grant policy to the railroads served as a means to populate the province in its early years.[30] Moraine Lake at Banff National Park. The Alberta Mountain forests makes up the southwestern boundary of Alberta. Most of the northern half of the province is boreal forest, while the Rocky Mountains along the southwestern boundary are largely forested (see Alberta Mountain forests and Alberta-British Columbia foothills forests). The southern quarter of the province is prairie, ranging from shortgrass prairie in the southeastern corner to mixed grass prairie in an arc to the west and north of it. The central aspen parkland region extending in a broad arc between the prairies and the forests, from Calgary, north to Edmonton, and then east to Lloydminster, contains the most fertile soil in the province and most of the population. Much of the unforested part of Alberta is given over either to grain or to dairy farming, with mixed farming more common in the north and centre, while ranching and irrigated agriculture predominate in the south.[31] The Alberta badlands are located in southeastern Alberta, where the Red Deer River crosses the flat prairie and farmland, and features deep canyons and striking landforms. Dinosaur Provincial Park, near Brooks, Alberta, showcases the badlands terrain, desert flora, and remnants from Alberta's past when dinosaurs roamed the then lush landscape. Climate[edit] Köppen climate types in Alberta Alberta has a humid continental climate with warm summers and cold winters. The province is open to cold arctic weather systems from the north, which often produce extremely cold conditions in winter. As the fronts between the air masses shift north and south across Alberta, the temperature can change rapidly. Arctic air masses in the winter produce extreme minimum temperatures varying from −54 °C (−65 °F) in northern Alberta to −46 °C (−51 °F) in southern Alberta, although temperatures at these extremes are rare. In the summer, continental air masses have produced record maximum temperatures from 32 °C (90 °F) in the mountains to over 40 °C (104 °F) in southeastern Alberta.[32] Alberta is a sunny province. Annual bright sunshine totals range between 1,900 up to just under 2,600 hours per year. Northern Alberta gets about 18 hours of daylight in the summer.[32] Alberta extends for over 1,200 km (750 mi) from north to south; its climate, therefore, varies considerably. Average high temperatures in January range from 0 °C (32 °F) in the southwest to −24 °C (−11 °F) in the far north. The climate is also influenced by the presence of the Rocky Mountains to the southwest, which disrupt the flow of the prevailing westerly winds and cause them to drop most of their moisture on the western slopes of the mountain ranges before reaching the province, casting a rain shadow over much of Alberta. The northerly location and isolation from the weather systems of the Pacific Ocean cause Alberta to have a dry climate with little moderation from the ocean. Annual precipitation ranges from 300 mm (12 in) in the southeast to 450 mm (18 in) in the north, except in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains where total precipitation including snowfall can reach 600 mm (24 in) annually.[28][33] There was a large drought in 2002 in Alberta and other regions of central North America. The province is the namesake of the Alberta clipper, a type of intense, fast-moving winter storm that generally forms over or near the province and, pushed with great speed by the continental polar jetstream, descends over the rest of Southern Canada and the northern tier of the United States.[34] In the summer, the average daytime temperatures range from around 21 °C (70 °F) in the Rocky Mountain valleys and far north, up to around 28 °C (82 °F) in the dry prairie of the southeast. The northern and western parts of the province experience higher rainfall and lower evaporation rates caused by cooler summer temperatures. The south and east-central portions are prone to drought-like conditions sometimes persisting for several years, although even these areas can receive heavy precipitation, sometimes resulting in flooding. In southwestern Alberta, the cold winters are frequently interrupted by warm, dry chinook winds blowing from the mountains, which can propel temperatures upward from frigid conditions to well above the freezing point in a very short period. During one chinook recorded at Pincher Creek, temperatures soared from −19 to 22 °C (−2.2 to 72 °F) in just one hour.[28] The region around Lethbridge has the most chinooks, averaging 30 to 35 chinook days per year. Calgary has a 56% chance of a white Christmas, while Edmonton has an 86% chance.[35] Southeastern Alberta features a semi-arid steppe climate. Northern Alberta is mostly covered by boreal forest and has a subarctic climate. The agricultural area of southern Alberta has a semi-arid steppe climate because the annual precipitation is less than the water that evaporates or is used by plants. The southeastern corner of Alberta, part of the Palliser Triangle, experiences greater summer heat and lower rainfall than the rest of the province, and as a result suffers frequent crop yield problems and occasional severe droughts. Western Alberta is protected by the mountains and enjoys the mild temperatures brought by winter chinook winds. Central and parts of northwestern Alberta in the Peace River region are largely aspen parkland, a biome transitional between prairie to the south and boreal forest to the north. After Saskatchewan, Alberta experiences the most tornadoes in Canada with an average of 15 verified per year.[36] Thunderstorms, some of them severe, are frequent in the summer, especially in central and southern Alberta. The region surrounding the Calgary–Edmonton Corridor is notable for having the highest frequency of hail in Canada, which is caused by orographic lifting from the nearby Rocky Mountains, enhancing the updraft/downdraft cycle necessary for the formation of hail.

In central and northern Alberta the arrival of spring is marked by the early flowering of the prairie crocus anemone; this member of the buttercup family has been recorded flowering as early as March, though April is the usual month for the general population.[39] Other prairie flora known to flower early are the golden bean and wild rose.[40] Members of the sunflower family blossom on the prairie in the summer months between July and September.[41] The southern and east central parts of Alberta are covered by short prairie grass,[42] which dries up as summer lengthens, to be replaced by hardy perennials such as the prairie coneflower, fleabane, and sage. Both yellow and white sweet clover can be found throughout the southern and central areas of the province. The trees in the parkland region of the province grow in clumps and belts on the hillsides. These are largely deciduous, typically aspen, poplar, and willow. Many species of willow and other shrubs grow in virtually any terrain. On the north side of the North Saskatchewan River evergreen forests prevail for thousands of square kilometres. Aspen poplar, balsam poplar (or in some parts cottonwood), and paper birch are the primary large deciduous species. Conifers include jack pine, Rocky Mountain pine, lodgepole pine, both white and black spruce, and the deciduous conifer tamarack. Fauna[edit] A bighorn sheep in Kananaskis Country. The bighorn sheep is the provincial mammal of Alberta. The four climatic regions (alpine, boreal forest, parkland, and prairie) of Alberta are home to many different species of animals. The south and central prairie was the land of the bison, commonly known as buffalo, its grasses providing pasture and breeding ground for millions of buffalo. The buffalo population was decimated during early settlement, but since then buffalo have made a comeback, living on farms and in parks all over Alberta. Herbivorous animals are found throughout the province. Moose, mule deer, elk, and white-tailed deer are found in the wooded regions, and pronghorn can be found in the prairies of southern Alberta. Bighorn sheep and mountain goats live in the Rocky Mountains. Rabbits, porcupines, skunks, squirrels and many species of rodents and reptiles live in every corner of the province. Alberta is home to only one variety of venomous snake, the prairie rattlesnake. Alberta is home to many large carnivores such as grizzly bears and black bears, which are found in the mountains and wooded regions. Smaller carnivores of the canine and feline families include coyotes, wolves, fox, lynx, bobcat and mountain lion (cougar). Central and northern Alberta and the region farther north is the nesting ground of many migratory birds. Vast numbers of ducks, geese, swans and pelicans arrive in Alberta every spring and nest on or near one of the hundreds of small lakes that dot northern Alberta. Eagles, hawks, owls and crows are plentiful, and a huge variety of smaller seed and insect-eating birds can be found. Alberta, like other temperate regions, is home to mosquitoes, flies, wasps, and bees. Rivers and lakes are populated with pike, walleye, whitefish, rainbow, speckled, brown trout, and sturgeon. Bull trout, native to the province, is Alberta's provincial fish. Turtles are found in some water bodies in the southern part of the province. Frogs and salamanders are a few of the amphibians that make their homes in Alberta. Alberta is the only province in Canada—as well as one of the few places in the world—that is free of Norwegian rats.[43] Since the early 1950s, the Government of Alberta has operated a rat-control program, which has been so successful that only isolated instances of wild rat sightings are reported, usually of rats arriving in the province aboard trucks or by rail. In 2006, Alberta Agriculture reported zero findings of wild rats; the only rat interceptions have been domesticated rats that have been seized from their owners. It is illegal for individual Albertans to own or keep Norwegian rats of any description; the animals can only be kept in the province by zoos, universities and colleges, and recognized research institutions. In 2009, several rats were found and captured, in small pockets in southern Alberta,[44] putting Alberta's rat-free status in jeopardy. A colony of rats were subsequently found in a landfill near Medicine Hat in 2012 and again in 2014.[45][46] Paleontology[edit] Specimens at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology, located in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation at Dinosaur Provincial Park Alberta has one of the greatest diversities and abundances of Late Cretaceous dinosaur fossils in the world.[47] Taxa are represented by complete fossil skeletons, isolated material, microvertebrate remains, and even mass graves. At least 38 dinosaur type specimens were collected in the province. The Foremost Formation, Oldman Formation and Dinosaur Park Formations collectively comprise the Judith River Group and are the most thoroughly studied dinosaur-bearing strata in Alberta.[47] Dinosaur-bearing strata are distributed widely throughout Alberta.[47] The Dinosaur Provincial Park area contains outcrops of the Dinosaur Park Formation and Oldman Formation. In the central and southern regions of Alberta are intermittent Scollard Formation outcrops. In the Drumheller Valley and Edmonton regions there are exposed Horseshoe Canyon facies. Other formations have been recorded as well, like the Milk River and Foremost Formations. However, these latter two have a lower diversity of documented dinosaurs, primarily due to their lower total fossil quantity and neglect from collectors who are hindered by the isolation and scarcity of exposed outcrops. Their dinosaur fossils are primarily teeth recovered from microvertebrate fossil sites. Additional geologic formations that have produced only few fossils are the Belly River Group and St. Mary River Formations of the southwest and the northwestern Wapiti Formation. The Wapiti Formation contains two Pachyrhinosaurus bone beds that break its general trend of low productivity, however. The Bearpaw Formation represents strata deposited during a marine transgression. Dinosaurs are known from this formation, but represent specimens washed out to sea or reworked from older sediments.[47] History[edit] Main article: History of Alberta See also: Timeline of Alberta history Blackfoot Confederacy warriors in Macleod in 1907 Paleo-Indians arrived in Alberta at least 10,000 years ago, toward the end of the last ice age. They are thought to have migrated from Siberia to Alaska on a land bridge across the Bering Strait and then possibly moved down the east side of the Rocky Mountains through Alberta to settle the Americas. Others may have migrated down the coast of British Columbia and then moved inland.[48] Over time they differentiated into various First Nations peoples, including the Plains Indian tribes of southern Alberta such as those of the Blackfoot Confederacy and the Plains Cree, who generally lived by hunting buffalo, and the more northerly tribes such as the Woodland Cree and Chipewyan who hunted, trapped, and fished for a living.[28] After the British arrival in Canada, approximately half of the province of Alberta, south of the Athabasca River drainage, became part of Rupert's Land which consisted of all land drained by rivers flowing into Hudson Bay. This area was granted by Charles II of England to the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) in 1670, and rival fur trading companies were not allowed to trade in it. The Athabasca River and the rivers north of it were not in HBC territory because they drained into the Arctic Ocean instead of Hudson Bay, and they were prime habitat for fur-bearing animals. The first European explorer of the Athabasca region was Peter Pond, who learned of the Methye Portage, which allowed travel from southern rivers into the rivers north of Rupert's Land. Fur traders formed the North West Company (NWC) of Montreal to compete with the HBC in 1779. The NWC occupied the northern part of Alberta territory. Peter Pond built Fort Athabasca on Lac la Biche in 1778. Roderick Mackenzie built Fort Chipewyan on Lake Athabasca ten years later in 1788. His cousin, Sir Alexander Mackenzie, followed the North Saskatchewan River to its northernmost point near Edmonton, then setting northward on foot, trekked to the Athabasca River, which he followed to Lake Athabasca. It was there he discovered the mighty outflow river which bears his name—the Mackenzie River—which he followed to its outlet in the Arctic Ocean. Returning to Lake Athabasca, he followed the Peace River upstream, eventually reaching the Pacific Ocean, and so he became the first European to cross the North American continent north of Mexico.[49] The extreme southernmost portion of Alberta was part of the French (and Spanish) territory of Louisiana, sold to the United States in 1803; in 1818, the portion of Louisiana north of the Forty-Ninth Parallel was ceded to Great Britain.[50] Fort Chipewyan, a trading post and regional headquarters for the Hudson's Bay Company in 1820 Fur trade expanded in the north, but bloody battles occurred between the rival HBC and NWC, and in 1821 the British government forced them to merge to stop the hostilities.[51] The amalgamated Hudson's Bay Company dominated trade in Alberta until 1870, when the newly formed Canadian Government purchased Rupert's Land. Northern Alberta was included in the North-Western Territory until 1870, when it and Rupert's land became Canada's North-West Territories. First Nations negotiated treaties with the Crown in which the Crown gained title to the land that would later become Alberta, and the Crown committed to ongoing support of the First Nations and guaranteed their hunting and fishing rights. The most significant treaties for Alberta are Treaty 6 (1876), Treaty 7 (1877) and Treaty 8 (1899). The District of Alberta was created as part of the North-West Territories in 1882. As settlement increased, local representatives to the North-West Legislative Assembly were added. After a long campaign for autonomy, in 1905, the District of Alberta was enlarged and given provincial status, with the election of Alexander Cameron Rutherford as the first premier. Less than a decade later, the First World War presented special challenges to the new province as an extraordinary number of volunteers left relatively few workers to maintain services and production. Over 50% of Alberta's doctors volunteered for service overseas.[52] 21st century[edit] Downtown Calgary was one of several areas afflicted during the 2013 Alberta floods. On June 21, 2013, during the 2013 Alberta floods Alberta experienced heavy rainfall that triggered catastrophic flooding throughout much of the southern half of the province along the Bow, Elbow, Highwood and Oldman rivers and tributaries. A dozen municipalities in Southern Alberta declared local states of emergency on June 21 as water levels rose and numerous communities were placed under evacuation orders.[53] In 2016, a wildfire resulted in the largest fire evacuation of residents in Alberta's history, as more than 80,000 people were ordered to evacuate.[54][55] Since 2020, Alberta has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.[56] Demographics[edit] Main article: Demographics of Alberta Population density of Alberta Historical populationYearPop.±%190173,022—    1911374,295+412.6%1921588,454+57.2%1931731,605+24.3%1941796,169+8.8%1951939,501+18.0%19561,123,116+19.5%19611,331,944+18.6%19661,463,203+9.9%19711,627,875+11.3%19761,838,035+12.9%19812,237,724+21.7%19862,365,830+5.7%19912,545,553+7.6%19962,696,826+5.9%20012,974,807+10.3%20063,290,350+10.6%20113,645,257+10.8%20164,067,175+11.6%[57][58][1]The 2016 census reported Alberta had a population of 4,067,175 living in 1,527,678 of its 1,654,129 total dwellings, an 11.6% change from its 2011 population of 3,645,257. With a land area of 640,330.46 km2 (247,232.97 sq mi), it had a population density of 6.4/km2 (16.5/sq mi) in 2016.[1] Statistics Canada estimated the province to have a population of 4,444,277 in Q2 of 2021.[2] Since 2000, Alberta's population has experienced a relatively high rate of growth, mainly because of its burgeoning economy. Between 2003 and 2004, the province had high birthrates (on par with some larger provinces such as British Columbia), relatively high immigration, and a high rate of interprovincial migration compared to other provinces.[59] In 2016, Alberta continued to have the youngest population among the provinces with a median age of 36.7 years, compared with the national median of 41.2 years. Also in 2016, Alberta had the smallest proportion of seniors (12.3%) among the provinces and one of the highest population shares of children (19.2%), further contributing to Alberta's young and growing population.[60] About 81% of the population lives in urban areas and only about 19% in rural areas. The Calgary–Edmonton Corridor is the most urbanized area in the province and is one of the most densely populated areas of Canada.[61] Many of Alberta's cities and towns have experienced very high rates of growth in recent history.[when?] Alberta's population rose from 73,022 in 1901[62] to 3,290,350 according to the 2006 census.[63] Census information[edit] According to the 2016 census, Alberta has 779,155 residents (19.2%) between the ages of 0-14, 2,787,805 residents (68.5%) between the ages of 15–64, and 500,215 residents (12.3%) aged 65 and over.[64] English is the most common mother tongue, with 2,991,485 native speakers.[64] This is followed by Tagalog, with 99,035 speakers, German, with 80,050 speakers, French, with 72,150 native speakers, and Hindi, with 68,695 speakers.[64] 253,460 residents identify as Aboriginal, including 136,585 as First Nations, 114,370 as Métis, and 2,500 as Inuit.[64] There are also 933,165 residents who identify as a visible minority, including 230,930 South Asian people, 166,195 Filipinos, and 158,200 Chinese respondents.[64] 1,769,500 residents hold a postsecondary certificate, diploma or degree, 895,885 residents have obtained a secondary (high) school diploma or equivalency certificate, and 540,665 residents do not have any certificate, diploma or degree.[64] The 2006 census found that English, with 2,576,670 native speakers, was the most common mother tongue of Albertans, representing 79.99% of the population. The next most common mother tongues were Chinese with 97,275 native speakers (3.02%), followed by German with 84,505 native speakers (2.62%) and French with 61,225 (1.90%).[65] Other mother tongues include: Punjabi, with 36,320 native speakers (1.13%); Tagalog, with 29,740 (0.92%); Ukrainian, with 29,455 (0.91%); Spanish, with 29,125 (0.90%); Polish, with 21,990 (0.68%); Arabic, with 20,495 (0.64%); Dutch, with 19,980 (0.62%); and Vietnamese, with 19,350 (0.60%). The most common aboriginal language is Cree 17,215 (0.53%). Other common mother tongues include Italian with 13,095 speakers (0.41%); Urdu with 11,275 (0.35%); and Korean with 10,845 (0.33%); then Hindi 8,985 (0.28%); Farsi 7,700 (0.24%); Portuguese 7,205 (0.22%); and Hungarian 6,770 (0.21%). Alberta has considerable ethnic diversity. In line with the rest of Canada, many are descended from immigrants of Western European nations, notably England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales and France, but large numbers later came from other regions of Europe, notably Germany, Ukraine and Scandinavia.[66] According to Statistics Canada, Alberta is home to the second-highest proportion (two percent) of Francophones in western Canada (after Manitoba). Despite this, relatively few Albertans claim French as their mother tongue. Many of Alberta's French-speaking residents live in the central and northwestern regions of the province, after migration from other areas of Canada or descending from Métis. As reported in the 2001 census, the Chinese represented nearly four percent of Alberta's population, and South Asians represented more than two percent. Both Edmonton and Calgary have historic Chinatowns, and Calgary has Canada's third-largest Chinese community. The Chinese presence began with workers employed in the building of the Canadian Pacific Railway in the 1880s. Aboriginal Albertans make up approximately three percent of the population. In the 2006 Canadian census, the most commonly reported ethnic origins among Albertans were: 885,825 English (27.2%); 679,705 German (20.9%); 667,405 Canadian (20.5%); 661,265 Scottish (20.3%); 539,160 Irish (16.6%); 388,210 French (11.9%); 332,180 Ukrainian (10.2%); 172,910 Dutch (5.3%); 170,935 Polish (5.2%); 169,355 North American Indian (5.2%); 144,585 Norwegian (4.4%); and 137,600 Chinese (4.2%). (Each person could choose as many ethnicities as were applicable.)[67] Amongst those of British heritage, the Scots have had a particularly strong influence on place-names, with the names of many cities and towns including Calgary, Airdrie, Canmore, and Banff having Scottish origins. Alberta is the third most diverse province in terms of visible minorities after British Columbia and Ontario with 13.9% of the population consisting of visible minorities in 2006.[68] Over one third of the populations of Calgary and Edmonton belong to a visible minority group.[69] Aboriginal Identity Peoples made up 5.8% of the population in 2006, about half of whom consist of First Nations and the other half are Métis. There are also small number of Inuit people in Alberta.[70] The number of Aboriginal Identity Peoples have been increasing at a rate greater than the population of Alberta.[70] As of the 2011 National Household Survey, the largest religious group was Roman Catholic, representing 24.3% of the population. Alberta had the second-highest percentage of non-religious residents among the provinces (after British Columbia) at 31.6% of the population. Of the remainder, 7.5% of the population identified themselves as belonging to the United Church of Canada, while 3.9% were Anglican. Lutherans made up 3.3% of the population while Baptists comprised 1.9%.[71] The remainder belonged to a wide variety of different religious affiliations, none of which constituted more than 2% of the population. Members of LDS Church are mostly concentrated in the extreme south of the province. Alberta has a population of Hutterites, a communal Anabaptist sect similar to the Mennonites, and has a significant population of Seventh-day Adventists. Alberta is home to several Byzantine Rite Churches as part of the legacy of Eastern European immigration, including the Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Edmonton, and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada's Western Diocese which is based in Edmonton. Muslims made up 3.2% of the population, Sikhs 1.5%, Buddhists 1.2%, and Hindus 1.0%. Many of these are immigrants, but others have roots that go back to the first settlers of the prairies. Canada's oldest mosque, the Al-Rashid Mosque, is located in Edmonton,[72] whereas Calgary is home to Canada's largest mosque, the Baitun Nur Mosque.[73] Alberta is also home to a growing Jewish population of about 15,400 people who constituted 0.3% of Alberta's population. Most of Alberta's Jews live in the metropolitan areas of Calgary (8,200) and Edmonton (5,500).[74] Municipalities[edit] Main article: List of communities in Alberta Airdrie Brooks Calgary Camrose Cold Lake Edmonton Fort Saskatchewan Grande Prairie Lacombe Leduc Lethbridge Lloydminster Medicine Hat Red Deer Spruce Grove St. Albert Wetaskiwin Distribution of cities in Alberta Largest metro areas and municipalities by population as of 2016 Census metropolitan areas: 2016[75] 2011 [76] 2006 [77] 2001 [78] 1996 [79] Calgary CMA 1,392,609 1,214,839 1,079,310 951,395 821,628 Edmonton CMA 1,321,426 1,159,869 1,034,945 937,845 862,597 Lethbridge CMA 117,394 105,999 95,196 87,388 82,025 Urban municipalities (10 largest): 2016[80] 2011 [81] 2006 [82] 2001 [83] 1996 [84] Calgary 1,239,220 1,096,833 988,193 878,866 768,082 Edmonton 932,546 812,201 730,372 666,104 616,306 Red Deer 100,418 90,564 82,772 67,707 60,080 Lethbridge 92,729 83,517 78,713 68,712 64,938 St. Albert (included in Edmonton CMA) 65,589 61,466 57,719 53,081 46,888 Medicine Hat 63,260 60,005 56,997 51,249 46,783 Grande Prairie 63,166 55,032 47,076 36,983 31,353 Airdrie (included in Calgary CMA) 61,581 42,564 28,927 20,382 15,946 Spruce Grove (included in Edmonton CMA) 34,066 26,171 19,496 15,983 14,271 Leduc (included in Edmonton CMA) 29,993 24,304 16,967 15,032 14,346 Specialized/rural municipalities (5 largest): 2016[80] 2011 [81] 2006 [82] 2001 [83] 1996 [84] Strathcona County (included in Edmonton CMA) 98,044 92,490 82,511 71,986 64,176 Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo (includes Fort McMurray) 71,589 65,565 51,496 42,581 35,213 Rocky View County (included in Calgary CMA) 39,407 36,461 34,171 29,925 23,326 Parkland County (included in Edmonton CMA) 32,097 30,568 29,265 27,252 24,769 Municipal District of Foothills No. 31 22,766 21,258 19,736 16,764 13,714 Economy[edit] Main article: Economy of Alberta See also: List of Canadian provinces and territories by gross domestic product Petroleum resources in Alberta Alberta's economy was one of the strongest in the world, supported by the burgeoning petroleum industry and to a lesser extent, agriculture and technology. In 2013, Alberta's per capita GDP exceeded that of the United States, Norway, or Switzerland,[85] and was the highest of any province in Canada at CA$84,390. This was 56% higher than the national average of CA$53,870 and more than twice that of some of the Atlantic provinces.[86][87] In 2006, the deviation from the national average was the largest for any province in Canadian history.[88] According to the 2006 census,[89] the median annual family income after taxes was $70,986 in Alberta (compared to $60,270 in Canada as a whole). In 2014, Alberta had the second-largest economy in Canada after Ontario, with a GDP exceeding CA$376 billion.[90] The GDP of the province calculated at basic prices rose by 4.6% in 2017 to $327.4 billion, which was the largest increase recorded in Canada, and it ended two consecutive years of decreases.[91] Alberta's debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to peak at 12.1% in fiscal year 2021–2022, falling to 11.3% the following year.[92] The Calgary-Edmonton Corridor is the most urbanized region in the province and one of the densest in Canada. The region covers a distance of roughly 400 kilometres north to south. In 2001, the population of the Calgary-Edmonton Corridor was 2.15 million (72% of Alberta's population).[93] It is also one of the fastest-growing regions in the country. A 2003 study by TD Bank Financial Group found the corridor to be the only Canadian urban centre to amass a U.S. level of wealth while maintaining a Canadian style quality of life, offering universal health care benefits. The study found that GDP per capita in the corridor was 10% above average U.S. metropolitan areas and 40% above other Canadian cities at that time. The Fraser Institute states that Alberta also has very high levels of economic freedom and rates Alberta as the freest economy in Canada,[94] and second-freest economy amongst U.S. states and Canadian provinces.[95] In 2014, Merchandise exports totalled US$121.4 billion. Energy revenues totalled $111.7 billion and Energy resource exports totalled $90.8 billion. Farm Cash receipts from agricultural products totalled $12.9 billion. Shipments of forest products totalled $5.4 billion while exports were $2.7 billion. Manufacturing sales totalled $79.4 billion, and Alberta's ICT industries generated over $13 billion in revenue. In total, Alberta's 2014 GDP amassed $364.5 billion in 2007 dollars, or $414.3 billion in 2015 dollars. In 2015, Alberta's GDP grew despite low oil prices; however, it was unstable with growth rates as high 4.4% and as low as 0.2%. Should the GDP remain at an average of 2.2% for the last two-quarters of 2015, Alberta's GDP should exceed $430 billion by the end of 2015.[96][97] However, RBC Economics research predicts Alberta's real GDP growth to only average 0.6% for the last two-quarters of 2015. This estimate predicts a real GDP growth of only 1.4% for 2015. A positive is the predicted 10.8% growth in Nominal GDP, and possibly above 11% in 2016.[98] Agriculture and forestry[edit] Cows in Rocky View. Nearly one-half of Canadian beef is produced in Alberta. Agriculture has a significant position in the province's economy. The province has over three million head of cattle,[99] and Alberta beef has a healthy worldwide market. Nearly one half of all Canadian beef is produced in Alberta. Alberta is one of the top producers of plains buffalo (bison) for the consumer market. Sheep for wool and mutton are also raised. Wheat and canola are primary farm crops, with Alberta leading the provinces in spring wheat production; other grains are also prominent. Much of the farming is dryland farming, often with fallow seasons interspersed with cultivation. Continuous cropping (in which there is no fallow season) is gradually becoming a more common mode of production because of increased profits and a reduction of soil erosion. Across the province, the once common grain elevator is slowly being lost as rail lines are decreasing; farmers typically truck the grain to central points.[100] Alberta is the leading beekeeping province of Canada, with some beekeepers wintering hives indoors in specially designed barns in southern Alberta, then migrating north during the summer into the Peace River valley where the season is short but the working days are long for honeybees to produce honey from clover and fireweed. Hybrid canola also requires bee pollination, and some beekeepers service this need.[101] A canola field in Alberta Forestry plays a vital role in Alberta's economy, providing over 15,000 jobs and contributing billions of dollars annually.[102] Uses for harvested timber include pulpwood, hardwood, engineered wood and bioproducts such as chemicals and biofuels. Recently,[when?] the United States has been Canada and Alberta's largest importer of hardwood and pulpwood,[103][failed verification][104][failed verification] although continued trades issues with the U.S.[104][failed verification] have likely been a contributing factor towards Alberta's increased focus on Asian markets.[102][failed verification] Industry[edit] Alberta is the largest producer of conventional crude oil, synthetic crude, natural gas and gas products in Canada. Alberta is the world's second-largest exporter of natural gas and the fourth-largest producer.[105] Two of the largest producers of petrochemicals in North America are located in central and north-central Alberta. In both Red Deer and Edmonton, polyethylene and vinyl manufacturers produce products that are shipped all over the world. Edmonton's oil refineries provide the raw materials for a large petrochemical industry to the east of Edmonton. The Athabasca oil sands surrounding Fort McMurray have estimated unconventional oil reserves approximately equal to the conventional oil reserves of the rest of the world, estimated to be 1.6 trillion barrels (254 km3). Many companies employ both conventional strip mining and non-conventional in situ methods to extract the bitumen from the oil sands. As of late 2006, there were over $100 billion in oil sands projects under construction or in the planning stages in northeastern Alberta.[106] Another factor determining the viability of oil extraction from the oil sands is the price of oil. The oil price increases since 2003 have made it profitable to extract this oil, which in the past would give little profit or even a loss. By mid-2014, however, rising costs and stabilizing oil prices were threatening the economic viability of some projects. An example of this was the shelving of the Joslyn north project in the Athabasca region in May 2014.[107] With concerted effort and support from the provincial government, several high-tech industries have found their birth in Alberta, notably patents related to interactive liquid-crystal display systems.[108] With a growing economy, Alberta has several financial institutions dealing with civil and private funds. Tourism[edit] Main article: Tourism in Alberta The Three Sisters at Bow Valley Provincial Park in Canmore Alberta has been a tourist destination from the early days of the twentieth century, with attractions including outdoor locales for skiing, hiking and camping, shopping locales such as West Edmonton Mall, Calgary Stampede, outdoor festivals, professional athletic events, international sporting competitions such as the Commonwealth Games and Olympic Games, as well as more eclectic attractions. According to Alberta Economic Development, Calgary and Edmonton both host over four million visitors annually. Banff, Jasper and the Rocky Mountains are visited by about three million people per year.[109] Alberta tourism relies heavily on Southern Ontario tourists, as well as tourists from other parts of Canada, the United States, and many other countries. There are also natural attractions like Elk Island National Park, Wood Buffalo National Park, and the Columbia Icefield. Alberta's Rockies include well-known tourist destinations Banff National Park and Jasper National Park. The two mountain parks are connected by the scenic Icefields Parkway. Banff is located 128 km (80 mi) west of Calgary on Highway 1, and Jasper is located 366 km (227 mi) west of Edmonton on Yellowhead Highway. Five of Canada's fourteen UNESCO World Heritage Sites are located within the province: Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks, Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park, Wood Buffalo National Park, Dinosaur Provincial Park and Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump. A number of these areas hold ski resorts, most notably Sunshine Village, Lake Louise, Marmot Basin, Norquay and Nakiska. Bronco riding at the Calgary Stampede. The event is one of the world's largest rodeos. About 1.2 million people visit the Calgary Stampede,[110] a celebration of Canada's own Wild West and the cattle ranching industry. About 700,000 people enjoy Edmonton's K-Days (formerly Klondike Days and Capital EX).[111][112] Edmonton was the gateway to the only all-Canadian route to the Yukon gold fields, and the only route which did not require gold-seekers to travel the exhausting and dangerous Chilkoot Pass. Another tourist destination that draws more than 650,000 visitors each year is the Drumheller Valley, located northeast of Calgary. Drumheller, ""Dinosaur Capital of The World"", offers the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology. Drumheller also had a rich mining history being one of Western Canada's largest coal producers during the war years. Another attraction in east-central Alberta is Alberta Prairie Railway Excursions, a popular tourist attraction operated out of Stettler, that offers train excursions into the prairie and caters to tens of thousands of visitors every year. Government and politics[edit] Main articles: Politics of Alberta and Monarchy in AlbertaSee also: List of Alberta Premiers, List of Alberta general elections, and Executive Council of Alberta The Government of Alberta is organized as a parliamentary democracy with a unicameral legislature. Its unicameral legislature—the Legislative Assembly—consists of 87 members elected first past the post (FPTP) from single-member constituencies.[113] Locally municipal governments and school boards are elected and operate separately. Their boundaries do not necessarily coincide. The Alberta Legislative Building serves as the meeting place for the Legislative Assembly of Alberta. As Queen of Canada, Elizabeth II is the head of state for the Government of Alberta. Her duties in Alberta are carried out by Lieutenant Governor Salma Lakhani.[114] The Queen and lieutenant governor are figureheads whose actions are highly restricted by custom and constitutional convention. The lieutenant governor handles numerous honorific duties in the name of the Queen. The government is headed by the premier. The premier is normally a member of the Legislative Assembly, and draws all the members of the Cabinet from among the members of the Legislative Assembly. The City of Edmonton is the seat of the provincial government—the capital of Alberta. The premier is Jason Kenney, sworn in on April 30, 2019. Alberta's elections have tended to yield much more conservative outcomes than those of other Canadian provinces. Since the 1960s, Alberta has had three main political parties, the Progressive Conservatives (""Conservatives"" or ""Tories""), the Liberals, and the social democratic New Democrats. The Wildrose Party, a more conservative party formed in early 2008, gained much support in the 2012 election and became the official opposition, a role it held until 2017 when it was dissolved and succeeded by the new United Conservative Party created by the merger of Wildrose and the Progressive Conservatives. The strongly conservative Social Credit Party was a power in Alberta for many decades, but fell from the political map after the Progressive Conservatives came to power in 1971. For 44 years the Progressive Conservatives governed Alberta. They lost the 2015 election to the NDP (which formed their own government for the first time in provincial history, breaking almost 80 consecutive years of right-wing rule),[115] suggesting at the time a possible shift to the left in the province, also indicated by the election of progressive mayors in both of Alberta's major cities.[116] Since becoming a province in 1905, Alberta has seen only five changes of government—only six parties have governed Alberta: the Liberals, from 1905 to 1921; the United Farmers of Alberta, from 1921 to 1935; the Social Credit Party, from 1935 to 1971; the Progressive Conservative Party, from 1971 to 2015; from 2015 to 2019, the Alberta New Democratic Party; and from 2019, the United Conservative Party, with the most recent transfer of power being the first time in provincial history that an incumbent government was not returned to a second term. Administrative divisions[edit] Distribution of Alberta's 6 specialized municipalities (red) and 74 rural municipalities, which include municipal districts (often named as counties) (orange), improvement districts (dark green) and special areas (light green) (2020) The province is divided into 10 types of local governments – urban municipalities (including cities, towns, villages and summer villages), specialized municipalities, rural municipalities (including municipal districts (often named as counties), improvement districts, and special areas), Métis settlements, and Indian reserves. All types of municipalities are governed by local residents and were incorporated under various provincial acts, with the exception of improvement districts (governed by either the provincial or federal government), and Indian reserves (governed by local First Nations people under federal jurisdiction). Law enforcement[edit] Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers in St. Albert. The RCMP provides municipal policing throughout most of Alberta. Policing in the province of Alberta upon its creation was the responsibility of the Royal Northwest Mounted Police. In 1917, due to pressures of World War I, the Alberta Provincial Police was created. This organization policed the province until it was disbanded as a Great Depression-era cost-cutting measure in 1932. It was at that time the now renamed Royal Canadian Mounted Police resumed policing of the province, specifically RCMP ""K"" Division. With the advent of the Alberta Sheriffs Branch, the distribution of duties of law enforcement in Alberta has been evolving as certain aspects, such as traffic enforcement, mobile surveillance and the close protection of the Premier of Alberta have been transferred to the Sheriffs. In 2006, Alberta formed the Alberta Law Enforcement Response Teams (ALERT) to combat organized crime and the serious offences that accompany it. ALERT is made up of members of the RCMP, Sheriffs Branch and various major municipal police forces in Alberta. Military[edit] Military bases in Alberta include Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Cold Lake, CFB Edmonton, CFB Suffield and CFB Wainwright. Air force units stationed at CFB Cold Lake have access to the Cold Lake Air Weapons Range.[117] CFB Edmonton is the headquarters for the 3rd Canadian Division.[118] CFB Suffield hosts British troops and is the largest training facility in Canada.[119] Taxation[edit] According to Alberta's 2009 budget, government revenue in that year came mainly from royalties on non-renewable natural resources (30.4%), personal income taxes (22.3%), corporate and other taxes (19.6%), and grants from the federal government primarily for infrastructure projects (9.8%).[120] In 2014, Alberta received $6.1 billion in bitumen royalties. With the drop in the price of oil in 2015 it was down to $1.4 billion. In 2016, Alberta received ""about $837 million in royalty payments from oil sands Royalty Projects"".[121] According to the 2018–21 fiscal plan, the two top sources of revenue in 2016 were personal income tax at $10, 763 million and federal transfers of $7,976 million with total resource revenue at $3,097 million.[122]:45 Alberta is the only province in Canada without a provincial sales tax. Alberta residents are still subject to the federal sales tax, the Goods and Services Tax of 5%. Revenue source in millions of dollars[122] personal income tax 10,763 federal transfers 7,976 Other tax revenue 5,649 Corporate income tax 3,769 Premiums, fees and licenses 3,701 Investment income 3,698 Resource revenue – other 1,614 Resource revenue – Bitumen royalties 1,483 Net income from business enterprises 543 Total revenue 42,293 From 2001 to 2016, Alberta was the only Canadian province to have a flat tax of 10% of taxable income, which was introduced by then-Premier, Ralph Klein, as part of the Alberta Tax Advantage, which also included a zero-percent tax on income below a ""generous personal exemption"".[123][124] In 2016, under then-Premier Rachel Notley, while most Albertans continued to pay the 10-per-cent income tax rate, new tax brackets 12-per-cent, 14-per-cent, and 15-per-cent for those with higher incomes ($128,145 annually or more) were introduced.[125][123] Alberta's personal income tax system maintained a progressive character by continuing to grant residents personal tax exemptions of $18,451,[126] in addition to a variety of tax deductions for persons with disabilities, students, and the aged.[127] Alberta's municipalities and school jurisdictions have their own governments who usually work in co-operation with the provincial government. By 2018, most Albertans continued to pay the 10-per-cent income tax rate.[125] According to a March 2015 Statistics Canada report, the median household income in Alberta in 2014 was about $100,000, which is 23 per cent higher than the Canadian national average.[128] Based on Statistic Canada reports, low income Albertans, who earn less than $25,000 and those in the high-income bracket earning $150,000 or more, are the lowest-taxed people in Canada.[125] Those in the middle income brackets representing those that earn about $25,000 to $75,000[Notes 1] pay more in provincial taxes than residents in British Columbia and Ontario.[125] In terms of income tax, Alberta is the ""best province"" for those with a low income because there is no provincial income tax for those who earn $18,915 or less.[125] Even with the 2016 progressive tax brackets up to 15%, Albertans who have the highest incomes, those with a $150,000 annual income or more—about 178,000 people in 2015, pay the least in taxes in Canada.[125] — About 1.9 million Albertans earned between $25,000 and $150,000 in 2015.[125] Alberta also privatized alcohol distribution. By 2010, privatization had increased outlets from 304 stores to 1,726; 1,300 jobs to 4,000 jobs; and 3,325 products to 16,495 products.[129] Tax revenue also increased from $400 million to $700 million. In 2017/18 Alberta collected about $2.4 billion in education property taxes from municipalities.[130] Albertan municipalities raise a significant portion of their income through levying property taxes.[131] The value of assessed property in Alberta was approximately $727 billion in 2011.[132] Most real property is assessed according to its market value.[131] The exceptions to market value assessment are farmland, railways, machinery & equipment and linear property, all of which is assessed by regulated rates.[133] Depending on the property type, property owners may appeal a property assessment to their municipal 'Local Assessment Review Board', 'Composite Assessment Review Board,' or the Alberta Municipal Government Board.[131][134] Culture[edit] Main article: Culture of Alberta See also: Festivals in Alberta Summer brings many festivals to the province of Alberta, especially in Edmonton. The Edmonton Fringe Festival is the world's second-largest after the Edinburgh Festival. Both Calgary and Edmonton host a number of annual festivals and events, including folk music festivals. The city's ""heritage days"" festival sees the participation of over 70 ethnic groups. Edmonton's Churchill Square is home to a large number of the festivals, including the large Taste of Edmonton & The Works Art & Design Festival throughout the summer months. The City of Calgary is also famous for its Stampede, dubbed ""The Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth"". The Stampede is Canada's biggest rodeo festival and features various races and competitions, such as calf roping and bull riding. In line with the western tradition of rodeo are the cultural artisans that reside and create unique Alberta western heritage crafts. An ice hockey game between the Calgary Flames, and the Edmonton Oilers, the two Alberta-based teams in the National Hockey League The Banff Centre hosts a range of festivals and other events including the international Mountain Film Festival. These cultural events in Alberta highlight the province's cultural diversity. Most of the major cities have several performing theatre companies who entertain in venues as diverse as Edmonton's Arts Barns and the Francis Winspear Centre for Music. Both Calgary and Edmonton are home to Canadian Football League and National Hockey League teams (the Stampeders/Flames and Edmonton Elks/Oilers respectively). Soccer, rugby union and lacrosse are also played professionally in Alberta. In 2019, the then Minister of Culture and Tourism Ricardo Miranda announced the Alberta Artist in Residence program in conjunction with the province's first Month of the Artist[135] to celebrate the arts and the value they bring to the province, both socially and economically,[136] The Artist is selected each year via a public and competitive process is expected to do community outreach and attend events to promote the arts throughout the province. The award comes with $60,000 funding which includes travel and materials costs.[137] On January 31, 2019, Lauren Crazybull named Alberta's 1st Artist in Residence.[138][139][137] Alberta is the first province to launch an Artist in Residence program in Canada. Education[edit] Main article: Education in Alberta As with any Canadian province, the Alberta Legislature has (almost) exclusive authority to make laws respecting education. Since 1905, the Legislature has used this capacity to continue the model of locally elected public and separate school boards which originated prior to 1905, as well as to create and regulate universities, colleges, technical institutions and other educational forms and institutions (public charter schools, private schools, home schooling). Elementary and secondary[edit] There are forty-two public school jurisdictions in Alberta, and seventeen operating separate school jurisdictions. Sixteen of the operating separate school jurisdictions have a Catholic electorate, and one (St. Albert) has a Protestant electorate. In addition, one Protestant separate school district, Glen Avon, survives as a ward of the St. Paul Education Region. The City of Lloydminster straddles the Alberta/Saskatchewan border, and both the public and separate school systems in that city are counted in the above numbers: both of them operate according to Saskatchewan law. For many years the provincial government has funded the greater part of the cost of providing K–12 education. Prior to 1994 public and separate school boards in Alberta had the legislative authority to levy a local tax on property as a supplementary support for local education. In 1994 the government of the province eliminated this right for public school boards, but not for separate school boards. Since 1994 there has continued to be a tax on property in support of K–12 education; the difference is that the mill rate is now set by the provincial government, the money is collected by the local municipal authority and remitted to the provincial government. The relevant legislation requires that all the money raised by this property tax must go to the support of K–12 education provided by school boards. The provincial government pools the property tax funds from across the province and distributes them, according to a formula, to public and separate school jurisdictions and Francophone authorities. Public and separate school boards, charter schools, and private schools all follow the Program of Studies and the curriculum approved by the provincial department of education (Alberta Education). Homeschool tutors may choose to follow the Program of Studies or develop their own Program of Studies. Public and separate schools, charter schools, and approved private schools all employ teachers who are certificated by Alberta Education, they administer Provincial Achievement Tests and Diploma Examinations set by Alberta Education, and they may grant high school graduation certificates endorsed by Alberta Education. Post-secondary[edit] Main article: Higher education in Alberta The University of Alberta in 2005. The institution is the oldest, and largest university in Alberta. The University of Alberta, located in Edmonton and established in 1908, is Alberta's oldest and largest university. The University of Calgary, once affiliated with the University of Alberta, gained its autonomy in 1966 and is now the second-largest university in Alberta. Athabasca University, which focuses on distance learning, and the University of Lethbridge are located in Athabasca and Lethbridge respectively. In early September 2009, Mount Royal University became Calgary's second public university, and in late September 2009, a similar move made MacEwan University Edmonton's second public university. There are 15 colleges that receive direct public funding, along with two technical institutes, Northern Alberta Institute of Technology and Southern Alberta Institute of Technology.[140] Two of the colleges, Red Deer College and Grande Prairie Regional College, were approved by the Alberta government to become degree granting universities.[141] There are also many private post-secondary institutions, mostly Christian Universities, bringing the total number of universities to 12. Students may also receive government loans and grants while attending selected private institutions. There was some controversy in 2005 over the rising cost of post-secondary education for students (as opposed to taxpayers). In 2005, Premier Ralph Klein made a promise that he would freeze tuition and look into ways of reducing schooling costs.[142][143] Health care[edit] Main article: Health care in Alberta See also: Health care in Canada Alberta provides a publicly funded, fully integrated health system, through Alberta Health Services (AHS)—a quasi-independent agency that delivers health care on behalf of the Government of Alberta's Ministry of Health.[144] The Alberta government provides health services for all its residents as set out by the provisions of the Canada Health Act of 1984. Alberta became Canada's second province (after Saskatchewan) to adopt a Tommy Douglas-style program in 1950, a precursor to the modern medicare system. Alberta's health care budget was $22.5 billion during the 2018–2019 fiscal year (approximately 45% of all government spending), making it the best-funded health-care system per-capita in Canada.[145] Every hour the province spends more than $2.5 million, (or $60 million per day), to maintain and improve health care in the province.[146] Notable health, education, research, and resources facilities in Alberta, all of which are located within Calgary or Edmonton. Health centres in Calgary include: Foothills Medical Centre in Calgary is the largest hospital in Alberta. Alberta Children's Hospital Foothills Medical Centre Grace Women's Health Centre Libin Cardiovascular Institute of Alberta Peter Lougheed Centre Rockyview General Hospital South Health Campus Tom Baker Cancer Centre University of Calgary Medical Centre (UCMC) Health centres in Edmonton include: Alberta Diabetes Institute Cross Cancer Institute Edmonton Clinic Grey Nuns Community Hospital Lois Hole Hospital for Women Mazankowski Alberta Heart Institute Misericordia Community Hospital Rexall Centre for Pharmacy and Health Research Royal Alexandra Hospital Stollery Children's Hospital University of Alberta Hospital The Edmonton Clinic complex, completed in 2012, provides a similar research, education, and care environment as the Mayo Clinic in the United States.[147][148] All public health care services funded by the Government of Alberta are delivered operationally by Alberta Health Services. AHS is the province's single health authority, established on July 1, 2008, which replaced nine regional health authorities. AHS also funds all ground ambulance services in the province, as well as the province-wide Shock Trauma Air Rescue Society (STARS) air ambulance service.[149] Transportation[edit] Air[edit] Calgary International Airport, the province's largest airport by passenger traffic. Alberta is well-connected by air, with international airports in both Calgary and Edmonton. Calgary International Airport and Edmonton International Airport are the fourth- and fifth-busiest in Canada, respectively. Calgary's airport is a hub for WestJet Airlines and a regional hub for Air Canada, primarily serving the prairie provinces (Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba) for connecting flights to British Columbia, eastern Canada, 15 major U.S. centres, nine European airports, one Asian airport and four destinations in Mexico and the Caribbean.[150] Edmonton's airport acts as a hub for the Canadian north and has connections to all major Canadian airports as well as airports in the United States, Europe, Mexico, and the Caribbean .[151] Public transit[edit] Calgary, Edmonton, Red Deer, Medicine Hat, and Lethbridge have substantial public transit systems. In addition to buses, Calgary and Edmonton operate light rail transit (LRT) systems. Edmonton LRT, which is underground in the downtown core and on the surface outside the CBD, was the first of the modern generation of light rail systems to be built in North America, while the Calgary C-Train has one of the highest number of daily riders of any LRT system in North America. Rail[edit] A Via Rail passenger train passing by freight trains in the background, at Jasper station There are more than 9,000 km (5,600 mi) of operating mainline railway in Alberta. The vast majority of this trackage is owned by the Canadian Pacific Railway and Canadian National Railway companies, which operate railway freight across the province. Additional railfreight service in the province is provided by two shortline railways: the Battle River Railway and Forty Mile Rail. Passenger trains include Via Rail's Canadian (Toronto–Vancouver) or Jasper–Prince Rupert trains, which use the CN mainline and pass through Jasper National Park and parallel the Yellowhead Highway during at least part of their routes. The Rocky Mountaineer operates two sections: one from Vancouver to Banff and Calgary over CP tracks, and a section that travels over CN tracks to Jasper. Road[edit] See also: List of Alberta provincial highways and List of airports in Alberta Alberta has over 181,000 km (112,000 mi) of highways and roads, of which nearly 41,000 km (25,000 mi) are paved.[152] The main north–south corridor is Highway 2, which begins south of Cardston at the Carway border crossing and is part of the CANAMEX Corridor. Highway 4, which effectively extends Interstate 15 into Alberta and is the busiest U.S. gateway to the province, begins at the Coutts border crossing and ends at Lethbridge. Highway 3 joins Lethbridge to Fort Macleod and links Highway 2 to Highway 4. Highway 2 travels north through Fort Macleod, Calgary, Red Deer, and Edmonton.[153] Highway 1 (The TransCanada Highway) at Alberta Highway 22 (Cowboy Trail). North of Edmonton, the highway continues to Athabasca, then northwesterly along the south shore of Lesser Slave Lake into High Prairie, north to Peace River, west to Fairview and finally south to Grande Prairie, where it ends at an interchange with Highway 43.[153] The section of Highway 2 between Calgary and Edmonton has been named the Queen Elizabeth II Highway to commemorate the visit of the monarch in 2005.[154] Highway 2 is supplemented by two more highways that run parallel to it: Highway 22, west of Highway 2, known as Cowboy Trail, and Highway 21, east of Highway 2. Highway 43 travels northwest into Grande Prairie and the Peace River Country; Highway 63 travels northeast to Fort McMurray, the location of the Athabasca oil sands.[153] Alberta has two main east–west corridors. The southern corridor, part of the Trans-Canada Highway system, enters the province near Medicine Hat, runs westward through Calgary, and leaves Alberta through Banff National Park. The northern corridor, also part of the Trans-Canada network and known as the Yellowhead Highway (Highway 16), runs west from Lloydminster in eastern Alberta, through Edmonton and Jasper National Park into British Columbia.[153] One of the most scenic drives is along the Icefields Parkway, which runs for 228 km (142 mi) between Jasper and Lake Louise, with mountain ranges and glaciers on either side of its entire length. A third corridor stretches across southern Alberta; Highway 3 runs between Crowsnest Pass and Medicine Hat through Lethbridge and forms the eastern portion of the Crowsnest Highway.[153] Another major corridor through central Alberta is Highway 11 (also known as the David Thompson Highway), which runs east from the Saskatchewan River Crossing in Banff National Park through Rocky Mountain House and Red Deer, connecting with Highway 12 20 km (12 mi) west of Stettler. The highway connects many of the smaller towns in central Alberta with Calgary and Edmonton, as it crosses Highway 2 just west of Red Deer.[153] Urban stretches of Alberta's major highways and freeways are often called trails. For example, Highway 2, the main north–south highway in the province, is called Deerfoot Trail as it passes through Calgary but becomes Calgary Trail (for southbound traffic) and Gateway Boulevard (for northbound traffic) as it enters Edmonton and then turns into St. Albert Trail as it leaves Edmonton for the City of St. Albert. Calgary, in particular, has a tradition of calling its largest urban expressways trails and naming many of them after prominent First Nations individuals and tribes, such as Crowchild Trail, Deerfoot Trail, and Stoney Trail.[155] Friendship partners[edit] Alberta has relationships with many provinces, states, and other entities worldwide.[156] Gangwon-do, South Korea (1974)[157] Hokkaido, Japan (1980) Heilongjiang, China (1981) Montana, United States (1985) Tyumen, Russia (1992) Khanty–Mansi, Russia (1995) Yamalo-Nenets, Russia (1997) Jalisco, Mexico (1999) Alaska, United States (2002) Saxony, Germany (2002) Ivano-Frankivsk, Ukraine (2004) Lviv, Ukraine (2005) California, United States (1997)[158] Guangdong, China (2017) See also[edit] Canada portal Index of Alberta-related articles Outline of Alberta Symbols of Alberta Notes[edit] ^ According to a 2018 CBC article, Albertans whose annual income is less than $25,000 pay the least income tax in Canada; those that earn about $50,000 ""pay more than both Ontarians and British Columbians"". Residents of British Columbia who earn about $75,000 pay $1,200 less in provincial taxes than those in Alberta. Albertans who earn about $100,000, ""pay less than Ontarians but still more than people in B.C."" Alberta taxpayers who earn $250,000 a year or more, pay $4,000 less in provincial taxes than someone with a similar income in B.C. and ""about $18,000 less than in Quebec.""

Please discuss this issue on the article's talk page. (January 2021) The Athabasca oil sands in Alberta, Canada, are a very large source of bitumen, which can be upgraded to synthetic crude heavy oil, Western Canadian Select (WCS) Tar sandstone from California, United States Oil sands, tar sands, crude bitumen, or bituminous sands, are a type of unconventional petroleum deposit. Oil sands are either loose sands or partially consolidated sandstone containing a naturally occurring mixture of sand, clay, and water, soaked with bitumen, a dense and extremely viscous form of petroleum. Significant bitumen deposits are reported in Canada,[1][2] Kazakhstan, Russia, and Venezuela. The estimated worldwide deposits of oil are more than 2 trillion barrels (320 billion cubic metres);[3] the estimates include deposits that have not been discovered. Proven reserves of bitumen contain approximately 100 billion barrels,[4] and total natural bitumen reserves are estimated at 249.67 Gbbl (39.694×10^9 m3) worldwide, of which 176.8 Gbbl (28.11×10^9 m3), or 70.8%, are in Alberta, Canada.[1] Crude bitumen is a thick, sticky form of crude oil, so viscous that it will not flow unless heated or diluted with lighter hydrocarbons such as light crude oil or natural-gas condensate. At room temperature, it is much like cold molasses.[5] The Orinoco Belt in Venezuela is sometimes described as oil sands, but these deposits are non-bituminous, falling instead into the category of heavy or extra-heavy oil due to their lower viscosity.[6] Natural bitumen and extra-heavy oil differ in the degree by which they have been degraded from the original conventional oils by bacteria. The 1973 and 1979 oil price increases, and development of improved extraction technology enabled profitable extraction and processing of the oil sands. Together with other so-called unconventional oil extraction practices, oil sands are implicated in the unburnable carbon debate but also contribute to energy security and counteract the international price cartel OPEC. According to the Oil Climate Index, carbon emissions from oil-sand crude are 31% higher than from conventional oil.[7] In Canada, oil sands production in general, and in-situ extraction, in particular, are the largest contributors to the increase in the nation's greenhouse gas emissions from 2005 to 2017, according to Natural Resources Canada (NRCan).[8] Contents 1 History 2 Cost of oil sands petroleum-mining operations 3 Nomenclature 4 Geology 4.1 Size of resources 4.2 Major deposits 4.2.1 Canada 4.2.1.1 Athabasca 4.2.1.2 Cold Lake 4.2.1.3 Peace River 4.2.2 Venezuela 4.2.2.1 Orinoco 4.3 Other deposits 5 Production 5.1 Canada 5.2 Venezuela 5.3 Other countries 6 Methods of extraction 6.1 Primary production 6.2 Surface mining 6.2.1 Oil sands tailings ponds 6.3 Cold Heavy Oil Production with Sand (CHOPS) 6.4 Cyclic Steam Stimulation (CSS) 6.5 Steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) 6.6 Vapor Extraction (VAPEX) 6.7 Toe to Heel Air Injection (THAI) 6.8 Combustion Overhead Gravity Drainage (COGD) 6.9 Froth treatment 7 Energy balance 8 Upgrading and/or blending 8.1 Canada 8.2 Venezuela 9 Transportation 9.1 Existing pipelines 9.2 New pipelines 9.3 Future pipelines 9.4 Rail 10 Refining 10.1 Canada 10.2 United States 10.3 Asia 11 Economics 11.1 Costs 11.2 Production forecasts 12 Environmental issues 12.1 Air pollution management 12.2 Land use and waste management 12.3 Water management 12.4 Greenhouse gas emissions 12.5 Aquatic life deformities 12.6 Public health impacts 13 See also 14 Notes 15 References 16 Further reading 17 External links History[edit] See also: History of the petroleum industry in Canada (oil sands and heavy oil) The exploitation of bituminous deposits and seeps dates back to Paleolithic times.[9] The earliest known use of bitumen was by Neanderthals, some 40,000 years ago. Bitumen has been found adhering to stone tools used by Neanderthals at sites in Syria. After the arrival of Homo sapiens, humans used bitumen for construction of buildings and waterproofing of reed boats, among other uses. In ancient Egypt, the use of bitumen was important in preparing mummies.[10] In ancient times, bitumen was primarily a Mesopotamian commodity used by the Sumerians and Babylonians, although it was also found in the Levant and Persia. The area along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers was littered with hundreds of pure bitumen seepages. The Mesopotamians used the bitumen for waterproofing boats and buildings. In Europe, they were extensively mined near the French city of Pechelbronn, where the vapour separation process was in use in 1742.[11][12] In Canada, the First Nation peoples had used bitumen from seeps along the Athabasca and Clearwater Rivers to waterproof their birch bark canoes from early prehistoric times. The Canadian oil sands first became known to Europeans in 1719 when a Cree native named Wa-Pa-Su brought a sample to Hudsons Bay Company fur trader Henry Kelsey, who commented on it in his journals. Fur trader Peter Pond paddled down the Clearwater River to Athabasca in 1778, saw the deposits and wrote of ""springs of bitumen that flow along the ground."" In 1787, fur trader and explorer Alexander MacKenzie on his way to the Arctic Ocean saw the Athabasca oil sands, and commented, ""At about 24 miles from the fork (of the Athabasca and Clearwater Rivers) are some bituminous fountains into which a pole of 20 feet long may be inserted without the least resistance.""[13] Cost of oil sands petroleum-mining operations[edit] In their May 2019 comparison of the ""cost of supply curve update"" in which the Norway-based Rystad Energy—an ""independent energy research and consultancy""—ranked the ""worlds total recoverable liquid resources by their breakeven price"", Rystad reported that the average breakeven price for oil from the oil sands was US$83 in 2019, making it the most expensive to produce, compared to all other ""significant oil producing regions"" in the world.[14][a] The International Energy Agency made similar comparisons.[15] The price per barrel of heavier, sour crude oils lacking in tidewater access—such as Western Canadian Select (WCS) from the Athabaska oil sands, are priced at a differential to the lighter, sweeter oil—such as West Texas Intermediate (WTI). The price is based on its grade—determined by factors such as its specific gravity or API and its sulfur content—and its location—for example, its proximity to tidewater and/or refineries. Because the cost of production is so much higher at oil sands petroleum-mining operations, the breakeven point is much higher than for sweeter lighter oils like that produced by Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, and, the United States.[14] Oil sands productions expand and prosper as the global price of oil increased to peak highs because of the Arab oil embargo of 1973, the 1979 Iranian Revolution, the 1990 Persian Gulf crisis and war, the 11 September 2001 attacks, and the 2003 invasion of Iraq.[16] The boom periods were followed by the bust, as the global price of oil dropped during the 1980s and again in the 1990s, during a period of global recessions, and again in 2003.[17] Nomenclature[edit] The name tar sands was applied to bituminous sands in the late 19th and early 20th century.[18] People who saw the bituminous sands during this period were familiar with the large amounts of tar residue produced in urban areas as a by-product of the manufacture of coal gas for urban heating and lighting.[19] The word ""tar"" to describe these natural bitumen deposits is really a misnomer, since, chemically speaking, tar is a human-made substance produced by the destructive distillation of organic material, usually coal.[20] Since then, coal gas has almost completely been replaced by natural gas as a fuel, and coal tar as a material for paving roads has been replaced by the petroleum product asphalt. Naturally occurring bitumen is chemically more similar to asphalt than to coal tar, and the term oil sands (or oilsands) is more commonly used by industry in the producing areas than tar sands because synthetic oil is manufactured from the bitumen,[20] and due to the feeling that the terminology of tar sands is less politically acceptable to the public.[21] Oil sands are now an alternative to conventional crude oil.[22] Geology[edit] See also: Petroleum Geology, Oil reserves in Canada, and Oil reserves in Venezuela The world's largest deposits of oil sands are in Venezuela and Canada. The geology of the deposits in the two countries is generally rather similar. They are vast heavy oil, extra-heavy oil, and/or bitumen deposits with oil heavier than 20°API, found largely in unconsolidated sandstones with similar properties. ""Unconsolidated"" in this context means that the sands have high porosity, no significant cohesion, and a tensile strength close to zero. The sands are saturated with oil which has prevented them from consolidating into hard sandstone.[6] Size of resources[edit] See also: List of countries by proven oil reserves The magnitude of the resources in the two countries is on the order of 3.5 to 4 trillion barrels (550 to 650 billion cubic metres) of original oil in place (OOIP). Oil in place is not necessarily oil reserves, and the amount that can be produced depends on technological evolution. Rapid technological developments in Canada in the 1985–2000 period resulted in techniques such as steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) that can recover a much greater percentage of the OOIP than conventional methods. The Alberta government estimates that with current technology, 10% of its bitumen and heavy oil can be recovered, which would give it about 200 billion barrels (32 billion m3) of recoverable oil reserves. Venezuela estimates its recoverable oil at 267 billion barrels (42 billion m3).[6] This places Canada and Venezuela in the same league as Saudi Arabia, having the three largest oil reserves in the world. Major deposits[edit] There are numerous deposits of oil sands in the world, but the biggest and most important are in Canada and Venezuela, with lesser deposits in Kazakhstan and Russia. The total volume of non-conventional oil in the oil sands of these countries exceeds the reserves of conventional oil in all other countries combined. Vast deposits of bitumen – over 350 billion cubic metres (2.2 trillion barrels) of oil in place – exist in the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. If only 30% of this oil could be extracted, it could supply the entire needs of North America for over 100 years at 2002 consumption levels. These deposits represent plentiful oil, but not cheap oil. They require advanced technology to extract the oil and transport it to oil refineries.[23] Canada[edit] See also: Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin § Oil sands The oil sands of the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) are a result of the formation of the Canadian Rocky Mountains by the Pacific Plate overthrusting the North American Plate as it pushed in from the west, carrying the formerly large island chains which now compose most of British Columbia. The collision compressed the Alberta plains and raised the Rockies above the plains, forming mountain ranges. This mountain building process buried the sedimentary rock layers which underlie most of Alberta to a great depth, creating high subsurface temperatures, and producing a giant pressure cooker effect that converted the kerogen in the deeply buried organic-rich shales to light oil and natural gas.[6][24] These source rocks were similar to the American so-called oil shales, except the latter have never been buried deep enough to convert the kerogen in them into liquid oil. This overthrusting also tilted the pre-Cretaceous sedimentary rock formations underlying most of the sub-surface of Alberta, depressing the rock formations in southwest Alberta up to 8 km (5 mi) deep near the Rockies, but to zero depth in the northeast, where they pinched out against the igneous rocks of the Canadian Shield, which outcrop on the surface. This tilting is not apparent on the surface because the resulting trench has been filled in by eroded material from the mountains. The light oil migrated up-dip through hydro-dynamic transport from the Rockies in the southwest toward the Canadian Shield in the northeast following a complex pre-Cretaceous unconformity that exists in the formations under Alberta. The total distance of oil migration southwest to northeast was about 500 to 700 km (300 to 400 mi). At the shallow depths of sedimentary formations in the northeast, massive microbial biodegradation as the oil approached the surface caused the oil to become highly viscous and immobile. Almost all of the remaining oil is found in the far north of Alberta, in Middle Cretaceous (115 million-year old) sand-silt-shale deposits overlain by thick shales, although large amounts of heavy oil lighter than bitumen are found in the Heavy Oil Belt along the Alberta-Saskatchewan border, extending into Saskatchewan and approaching the Montana border. Note that, although adjacent to Alberta, Saskatchewan has no massive deposits of bitumen, only large reservoirs of heavy oil >10°API.[6][24] Most of the Canadian oil sands are in three major deposits in northern Alberta. They are the Athabasca-Wabiskaw oil sands of north northeastern Alberta, the Cold Lake deposits of east northeastern Alberta, and the Peace River deposits of northwestern Alberta. Between them, they cover over 140,000 square kilometres (54,000 sq mi)—an area larger than England—and contain approximately 1.75 Tbbl (280×10^9 m3) of crude bitumen in them. About 10% of the oil in place, or 173 Gbbl (27.5×10^9 m3), is estimated by the government of Alberta to be recoverable at current prices, using current technology, which amounts to 97% of Canadian oil reserves and 75% of total North American petroleum reserves.[2] Although the Athabasca deposit is the only one in the world which has areas shallow enough to mine from the surface, all three Alberta areas are suitable for production using in-situ methods, such as cyclic steam stimulation (CSS) and steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD). The largest Canadian oil sands deposit, the Athabasca oil sands is in the McMurray Formation, centered on the city of Fort McMurray, Alberta. It outcrops on the surface (zero burial depth) about 50 km (30 mi) north of Fort McMurray, where enormous oil sands mines have been established, but is 400 m (1,300 ft) deep southeast of Fort McMurray. Only 3% of the oil sands area containing about 20% of the recoverable oil can be produced by surface mining, so the remaining 80% will have to be produced using in-situ wells. The other Canadian deposits are between 350 to 900 m (1,000 to 3,000 ft) deep and will require in-situ production.[6][24] Athabasca[edit] See also: Wabasca oil sands The City of Fort McMurray on the banks of the Athabasca River This section is an excerpt from Athabasca oil sands[edit] The Athabasca oil sands, also known as the Athabasca tar sands, are large deposits of bitumen or extremely heavy crude oil, located in northeastern Alberta, Canada – roughly centred on the boomtown of Fort McMurray. These oil sands, hosted primarily in the McMurray Formation, consist of a mixture of crude bitumen (a semi-solid rock-like form of crude oil), silica sand, clay minerals, and water. The Athabasca deposit is the largest known reservoir of crude bitumen in the world and the largest of three major oil sands deposits in Alberta, along with the nearby Peace River and Cold Lake deposits (the latter stretching into Saskatchewan).[25] Together, these oil sand deposits lie under 141,000 square kilometres (54,000 sq mi) of boreal forest and muskeg (peat bogs) and contain about 1.7 trillion barrels (270×10^9 m3) of bitumen in-place, comparable in magnitude to the world's total proven reserves of conventional petroleum. The International Energy Agency (IEA) lists the economically recoverable reserves, at 2007 prices and modern unconventional oil production technology, to be 178 billion barrels (28.3×10^9 m3), or about 10% of these deposits.[25] These contribute to Canada's total proven reserves being the third largest in the world, after Saudi Arabia and Venezuela's Orinoco Belt.[26] By 2009, the two extraction methods used were in situ extraction, when the bitumen occurs deeper within the ground, (which will account for 80 percent of oil sands development) and surface or open-pit mining, when the bitumen is closer to the surface. Only 20 percent of bitumen can be extracted using open pit mining methods,[27] which involves large scale excavation of the land with huge hydraulic power shovels and 400-ton heavy hauler trucks. Surface mining leaves toxic tailings ponds. In contrast, in situ uses more specialized techniques such as steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD). ""Eighty percent of the oil sands will be developed in situ which accounts for 97.5 percent of the total surface area of the oil sands region in Alberta.""[28] In 2006 the Athabasca deposit was the only large oil sands reservoir in the world which was suitable for large-scale surface mining, although most of this reservoir can only be produced using more recently developed in-situ technology.[26] Cold Lake[edit] Main article: Cold Lake oil sands See also: CFB Cold Lake Cold Lake viewed from Meadow Lake Provincial Park, Saskatchewan The Cold Lake oil sands are northeast of Alberta's capital, Edmonton, near the border with Saskatchewan. A small portion of the Cold Lake deposit lies in Saskatchewan. Although smaller than the Athabasca oil sands, the Cold Lake oil sands are important because some of the oil is fluid enough to be extracted by conventional methods. The Cold Lake bitumen contains more alkanes and less asphaltenes than the other major Alberta oil sands and the oil is more fluid.[29] As a result, cyclic steam stimulation (CSS) is commonly used for production. The Cold Lake oil sands are of a roughly circular shape, centered around Bonnyville, Alberta. They probably contain over 60 billion cubic metres (370 billion barrels) of extra-heavy oil-in-place. The oil is highly viscous, but considerably less so than the Athabasca oil sands, and is somewhat less sulfurous. The depth of the deposits is 400 to 600 metres (1,300 to 2,000 ft) and they are from 15 to 35 metres (49 to 115 ft) thick.[23] They are too deep to surface mine. Much of the oil sands are on Canadian Forces Base Cold Lake. CFB Cold Lake's CF-18 Hornet jet fighters defend the western half of Canadian air space and cover Canada's Arctic territory. Cold Lake Air Weapons Range (CLAWR) is one of the largest live-drop bombing ranges in the world, including testing of cruise missiles. As oil sands production continues to grow, various sectors vie for access to airspace, land, and resources, and this complicates oil well drilling and production significantly. Peace River[edit] This section is an excerpt from Peace River oil sands[edit] The Peace River oil sands deposit lies in the west of Alberta, and is deeper than the larger, better known Athabasca oil sands. Located in northwest-central Alberta, the Peace River oil sands deposit is the smallest of four large deposits of oil sands[30] of the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin formation.[30] The Peace River oil sands lie, generally, in the watershed of the Peace River. The Peace River oil sands deposits are the smallest in the province. The largest, the Athabasca oil sands, are located to the east, the second largest the, Cold Lake oil sands deposit is south of Athabaska and the Wabasco oil sands are south of Athabaska and usually linked to it.[30] According to the Petroleum Economist, oil sands occur in more than 70 countries, but the bulk is found in these four regions together covering an area of some 77,000 square kilometres (30,000 sq mi).[31] In 2007 the World Energy Council estimated that these oil sands areas contained at least two-thirds of the world's discovered bitumen in place at the time,[32] with an original oil-in-place (OOIP) reserve of 260,000,000,000 cubic metres (9.2×1012 cu ft) (1.6 trn barrels), an amount comparable to the total world reserves of conventional oil. Whereas the Athabasca oil sands lie close enough to the surface that the sand can be scooped up in open-pit mines, and brought to a central location for processing, the Peace River deposits are considered too deep, and are exploited in situ using steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) and Cold Heavy Oil Production with Sand (CHOPS).[33] Venezuela[edit] This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (May 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The Eastern Venezuelan Basin has a structure similar to the WCSB, but on a shorter scale. The distance the oil has migrated up-dip from the Sierra Orientale mountain front to the Orinoco oil sands where it pinches out against the igneous rocks of the Guyana Shield is only about 200 to 300 km (100 to 200 mi). The hydrodynamic conditions of oil transport were similar, source rocks buried deep by the rise of the mountains of the Sierra Orientale produced light oil that moved up-dip toward the south until it was gradually immobilized by the viscosity increase caused by biodgradation near the surface. The Orinoco deposits are early Tertiary (50 to 60 million years old) sand-silt-shale sequences overlain by continuous thick shales, much like the Canadian deposits. In Venezuela, the Orinoco Belt oil sands range from 350 to 1,000 m (1,000 to 3,000 ft) deep and no surface outcrops exist. The deposit is about 500 km (300 mi) long east-to-west and 50 to 60 km (30 to 40 mi) wide north-to-south, much less than the combined area covered by the Canadian deposits. In general, the Canadian deposits are found over a much wider area, have a broader range of properties, and have a broader range of reservoir types than the Venezuelan ones, but the geological structures and mechanisms involved are similar. The main differences is that the oil in the sands in Venezuela is less viscous than in Canada, allowing some of it to be produced by conventional drilling techniques, but none of it approaches the surface as in Canada, meaning none of it can be produced using surface mining. The Canadian deposits will almost all have to be produced by mining or using new non-conventional techniques. Orinoco[edit] Main article: Orinoco oil sands See also: History of the Venezuelan oil industry See also: PDVSA Panorama of the Orinoco River The Orinoco Belt is a territory in the southern strip of the eastern Orinoco River Basin in Venezuela which overlies one of the world's largest deposits of petroleum. The Orinoco Belt follows the line of the river. It is approximately 600 kilometres (370 mi) from east to west, and 70 kilometres (43 mi) from north to south, with an area about 55,314 square kilometres (21,357 sq mi). The oil sands consist of large deposits of extra heavy crude. Venezuela's heavy oil deposits of about 1,200 Gbbl (190×10^9 m3) of oil in place are estimated to approximately equal the world's reserves of lighter oil.[1] Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), Venezuela's national oil company, has estimated that the producible reserves of the Orinoco Belt are up to 235 Gbbl (37.4×10^9 m3)[34] which would make it the largest petroleum reserve in the world. In 2009, the US Geological Survey (USGS) increased its estimates of the reserves to 513 Gbbl (81.6×10^9 m3) of oil which is ""technically recoverable (producible using currently available technology and industry practices)."" No estimate of how much of the oil is economically recoverable was made.[35] Other deposits[edit] Location of Melville Island In addition to the three major Canadian oil sands in Alberta, there is a fourth major oil sands deposit in Canada, the Melville Island oil sands in the Canadian Arctic islands, which are too remote to expect commercial production in the foreseeable future. Apart from the megagiant[36] oil sands deposits in Canada and Venezuela, numerous other countries hold smaller oil sands deposits. In the United States, there are supergiant[36] oil sands resources primarily concentrated in Eastern Utah, with a total of 32 Gbbl (5.1×10^9 m3) of oil (known and potential) in eight major deposits in Carbon, Garfield, Grand, Uintah, and Wayne counties.[37] In addition to being much smaller than the Canadian oil sands deposits, the US oil sands are hydrocarbon-wet, whereas the Canadian oil sands are water-wet.[38] This requires somewhat different extraction techniques for the Utah oil sands from those used for the Alberta oil sands. Russia holds oil sands in two main regions. Large resources are present in the Tunguska Basin, East Siberia, with the largest deposits being Olenek and Siligir. Other deposits are located in the Timan-Pechora and Volga-Urals basins (in and around Tatarstan), which is an important but very mature province in terms of conventional oil, holds large amounts of oil sands in a shallow permian formation.[1][39] In Kazakhstan, large bitumen deposits are located in the North Caspian Basin. In Madagascar, Tsimiroro and Bemolanga are two heavy oil sands deposits, with a pilot well already producing small amounts of oil in Tsimiroro.[40] and larger scale exploitation in the early planning phase.[41] In the Republic of the Congo reserves are estimated between 0.5 and 2.5 Gbbl (79×10^6 and 397×10^6 m3). Production[edit] Bituminous sands are a major source of unconventional oil, although only Canada has a large-scale commercial oil sands industry. In 2006, bitumen production in Canada averaged 1.25 Mbbl/d (200,000 m3/d) through 81 oil sands projects. 44% of Canadian oil production in 2007 was from oil sands.[42] This proportion was (as of 2008) expected to increase in coming decades as bitumen production grows while conventional oil production declines, although due to the 2008 economic downturn work on new projects has been deferred.[2] Petroleum is not produced from oil sands on a significant level in other countries.[38] Canada[edit] Main article: Petroleum production in Canada See also: History of the petroleum industry in Canada (oil sands and heavy oil) The Alberta oil sands have been in commercial production since the original Great Canadian Oil Sands (now Suncor Energy) mine began operation in 1967. Syncrude's second mine began operation in 1978 and is the biggest mine of any type in the world. The third mine in the Athabasca Oil Sands, the Albian Sands consortium of Shell Canada, Chevron Corporation, and Western Oil Sands Inc. (purchased by Marathon Oil Corporation in 2007) began operation in 2003. Petro-Canada was also developing a $33 billion Fort Hills Project, in partnership with UTS Energy Corporation and Teck Cominco, which lost momentum after the 2009 merger of Petro-Canada into Suncor.[43] By 2013 there were nine oil sands mining projects in the Athabasca oil sands deposit: Suncor Energy Inc. (Suncor), Syncrude Canada Limited (Syncrude)'s Mildred Lake and Aurora North, Shell Canada Limited (Shell)'s Muskeg River and Jackpine, Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNRL)'s Horizon, Imperial Oil Resources Ventures Limited (Imperial), Kearl Oil Sands Project (KOSP), Total E&P Canada Ltd. Joslyn North Mine and Fort Hills Energy Corporation (FHEC).[44] In 2011 alone they produced over 52 million cubic metres of bitumen.[44] Venezuela[edit] Main article: History of the Venezuelan oil industry See also: PDVSA No significant development of Venezuela's extra-heavy oil deposits was undertaken before 2000, except for the BITOR operation which produced somewhat less than 100,000 barrels of oil per day (16,000 m3/d) of 9°API oil by primary production. This was mostly shipped as an emulsion (Orimulsion) of 70% oil and 30% water with similar characteristics as heavy fuel oil for burning in thermal power plants.[6] However, when a major strike hit the Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA, most of the engineers were fired as punishment.[citation needed] Orimulsion had been the pride of the PDVSA engineers, so Orimulsion fell out of favor with the key political leaders. As a result, the government has been trying to ""Wind Down"" the Orimulsion program.[citation needed] Despite the fact that the Orinoco oil sands contain extra-heavy oil which is easier to produce than Canada's similarly sized reserves of bitumen, Venezuela's oil production has been declining in recent years because of the country's political and economic problems, while Canada's has been increasing. As a result, Canadian heavy oil and bitumen exports have been backing Venezuelan heavy and extra-heavy oil out of the US market, and Canada's total exports of oil to the US have become several times as great as Venezuela's. By 2016, with the economy of Venezuela in a tailspin and the country experiencing widespread shortages of food, rolling power blackouts, rioting, and anti-government protests, it was unclear how much new oil sands production would occur in the near future.[45] Other countries[edit] In May 2008, the Italian oil company Eni announced a project to develop a small oil sands deposit in the Republic of the Congo. Production is scheduled to commence in 2014 and is estimated to eventually yield a total of 40,000 bbl/d (6,400 m3/d).[46] Methods of extraction[edit] Except for a fraction of the extra-heavy oil or bitumen which can be extracted by conventional oil well technology, oil sands must be produced by strip mining or the oil made to flow into wells using sophisticated in-situ techniques. These methods usually use more water and require larger amounts of energy than conventional oil extraction. While much of Canada's oil sands are being produced using open-pit mining, approximately 90% of Canadian oil sands and all of Venezuela's oil sands are too far below the surface to use surface mining.[47] Primary production[edit] Conventional crude oil is normally extracted from the ground by drilling oil wells into a petroleum reservoir, allowing oil to flow into them under natural reservoir pressures, although artificial lift and techniques such as horizontal drilling, water flooding and gas injection are often required to maintain production. When primary production is used in the Venezuelan oil sands, where the extra-heavy oil is about 50 degrees Celsius, the typical oil recovery rates are about 8–12%. Canadian oil sands are much colder and more biodegraded, so bitumen recovery rates are usually only about 5–6%. Historically, primary recovery was used in the more fluid areas of Canadian oil sands. However, it recovered only a small fraction of the oil in place, so it is not often used today.[48] Surface mining[edit] Main article: History of the petroleum industry in Canada (oil sands and heavy oil) § Surface extraction See also: Athabasca oil sands § Surface mining See also: Surface mining Mining operations in the Athabasca oil sands. NASA Earth Observatory image, 2009. The Athabasca oil sands are the only major oil sands deposits which are shallow enough to surface mine. In the Athabasca sands there are very large amounts of bitumen covered by little overburden, making surface mining the most efficient method of extracting it. The overburden consists of water-laden muskeg (peat bog) over top of clay and barren sand. The oil sands themselves are typically 40 to 60 metres (130 to 200 ft) thick deposits of crude bitumen embedded in unconsolidated sandstone, sitting on top of flat limestone rock. Since Great Canadian Oil Sands (now Suncor Energy) started operation of the first large-scale oil sands mine in 1967, bitumen has been extracted on a commercial scale and the volume has grown at a steady rate ever since. A large number of oil sands mines are currently in operation and more are in the stages of approval or development. The Syncrude Canada mine was the second to open in 1978, Shell Canada opened its Muskeg River mine (Albian Sands) in 2003 and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd (CNRL) opened its Horizon Oil Sands project in 2009. Newer mines include Shell Canada's Jackpine mine,[49] Imperial Oil's Kearl Oil Sands Project, the Synenco Energy (now owned by Total S.A.) Northern Lights mine, and Suncor's Fort Hills mine. Oil sands tailings ponds[edit] Main article: Oil sands tailings ponds (Canada) Syncrude's Mildred Lake site, plant and tailings ponds Fort McMurray, Alberta Oil sands tailings ponds are engineered dam and dyke systems that contain salts, suspended solids and other dissolvable chemical compounds such as naphthenic acids, benzene, hydrocarbons[50] residual bitumen, fine silts (mature fine tails MFT), and water.[51] Large volumes of tailings are a byproduct of surface mining of the oil sands and managing these tailings is one of the most difficult environmental challenges facing the oil sands industry.[51] The Government of Alberta reported in 2013 that tailings ponds in the Alberta oil sands covered an area of about 77 square kilometres (30 sq mi).[51] The Syncrude Tailings Dam or Mildred Lake Settling Basin (MLSB) is an embankment dam that is, by volume of construction material, the largest earth structure in the world in 2001.[52] Cold Heavy Oil Production with Sand (CHOPS)[edit] Main article: Cold heavy oil production with sand Some years ago Canadian oil companies discovered that if they removed the sand filters from heavy oil wells and produced as much sand as possible with the oil, production rates improved significantly. This technique became known as Cold Heavy Oil Production with Sand (CHOPS). Further research disclosed that pumping out sand opened ""wormholes"" in the sand formation which allowed more oil to reach the wellbore. The advantage of this method is better production rates and recovery (around 10% versus 5–6% with sand filters in place) and the disadvantage that disposing of the produced sand is a problem. A novel way to do this was spreading it on rural roads, which rural governments liked because the oily sand reduced dust and the oil companies did their road maintenance for them. However, governments have become concerned about the large volume and composition of oil spread on roads.[53] so in recent years disposing of oily sand in underground salt caverns has become more common. Cyclic Steam Stimulation (CSS)[edit] See also: Steam injection (oil industry) The use of steam injection to recover heavy oil has been in use in the oil fields of California since the 1950s. The cyclic steam stimulation (CSS) ""huff-and-puff"" method is now widely used in heavy oil production worldwide due to its quick early production rates; however recovery factors are relatively low (10–40% of oil in place) compared to SAGD (60–70% of OIP).[citation needed] CSS has been in use by Imperial Oil at Cold Lake since 1985 and is also used by Canadian Natural Resources at Primrose and Wolf Lake and by Shell Canada at Peace River. In this method, the well is put through cycles of steam injection, soak, and oil production. First, steam is injected into a well at a temperature of 300 to 340 degrees Celsius for a period of weeks to months; then, the well is allowed to sit for days to weeks to allow heat to soak into the formation; and, later, the hot oil is pumped out of the well for a period of weeks or months. Once the production rate falls off, the well is put through another cycle of injection, soak and production. This process is repeated until the cost of injecting steam becomes higher than the money made from producing oil.[54] Steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD)[edit] Main article: Steam-assisted gravity drainage Steam-assisted gravity drainage was developed in the 1980s by the Alberta Oil Sands Technology and Research Authority and fortuitously coincided with improvements in directional drilling technology that made it quick and inexpensive to do by the mid 1990s. In SAGD, two horizontal wells are drilled in the oil sands, one at the bottom of the formation and another about 5 metres above it. These wells are typically drilled in groups off central pads and can extend for miles in all directions. In each well pair, steam is injected into the upper well, the heat melts the bitumen, which allows it to flow into the lower well, where it is pumped to the surface.[54] SAGD has proved to be a major breakthrough in production technology since it is cheaper than CSS, allows very high oil production rates, and recovers up to 60% of the oil in place. Because of its economic feasibility and applicability to a vast area of oil sands, this method alone quadrupled North American oil reserves and allowed Canada to move to second place in world oil reserves after Saudi Arabia. Most major Canadian oil companies now have SAGD projects in production or under construction in Alberta's oil sands areas and in Wyoming. Examples include Japan Canada Oil Sands Ltd's (JACOS) project, Suncor's Firebag project, Nexen's Long Lake project, Suncor's (formerly Petro-Canada's) MacKay River project, Husky Energy's Tucker Lake and Sunrise projects, Shell Canada's Peace River project, Cenovus Energy's Foster Creek[55] and Christina Lake[56] developments, ConocoPhillips' Surmont project, Devon Canada's Jackfish project, and Derek Oil & Gas's LAK Ranch project. Alberta's OSUM Corp has combined proven underground mining technology with SAGD to enable higher recovery rates by running wells underground from within the oil sands deposit, thus also reducing energy requirements compared to traditional SAGD. This particular technology application is in its testing phase. Vapor Extraction (VAPEX)[edit] Several methods use solvents, instead of steam, to separate bitumen from sand. Some solvent extraction methods may work better in in situ production and other in mining.[57] Solvent can be beneficial if it produces more oil while requiring less energy to produce steam. Vapor Extraction Process (VAPEX) is an in situ technology, similar to SAGD. Instead of steam, hydrocarbon solvents are injected into an upper well to dilute bitumen and enables the diluted bitumen to flow into a lower well. It has the advantage of much better energy efficiency over steam injection, and it does some partial upgrading of bitumen to oil right in the formation. The process has attracted attention from oil companies, who are experimenting with it. The above methods are not mutually exclusive. It is becoming common for wells to be put through one CSS injection-soak-production cycle to condition the formation prior to going to SAGD production, and companies are experimenting with combining VAPEX with SAGD to improve recovery rates and lower energy costs.[58] Toe to Heel Air Injection (THAI)[edit] This is a very new and experimental method that combines a vertical air injection well with a horizontal production well. The process ignites oil in the reservoir and creates a vertical wall of fire moving from the ""toe"" of the horizontal well toward the ""heel"", which burns the heavier oil components and upgrades some of the heavy bitumen into lighter oil right in the formation. Historically fireflood projects have not worked out well because of difficulty in controlling the flame front and a propensity to set the producing wells on fire. However, some oil companies feel the THAI method will be more controllable and practical, and have the advantage of not requiring energy to create steam.[59] Advocates of this method of extraction state that it uses less freshwater, produces 50% less greenhouse gases, and has a smaller footprint than other production techniques.[60] Petrobank Energy and Resources has reported encouraging results from their test wells in Alberta, with production rates of up to 400 bbl/d (64 m3/d) per well, and the oil upgraded from 8 to 12 API degrees. The company hopes to get a further 7-degree upgrade from its CAPRI (controlled atmospheric pressure resin infusion)[61] system, which pulls the oil through a catalyst lining the lower pipe.[62][63][64] After several years of production in situ, it has become clear that current THAI methods do not work as planned. Amid steady drops in production from their THAI wells at Kerrobert, Petrobank has written down the value of their THAI patents and the reserves at the facility to zero. They have plans to experiment with a new configuration they call ""multi-THAI,"" involving adding more air injection wells.[65] Combustion Overhead Gravity Drainage (COGD)[edit] This is an experimental method that employs a number of vertical air injection wells above a horizontal production well located at the base of the bitumen pay zone. An initial Steam Cycle similar to CSS is used to prepare the bitumen for ignition and mobility. Following that cycle, air is injected into the vertical wells, igniting the upper bitumen and mobilizing (through heating) the lower bitumen to flow into the production well. It is expected that COGD will result in water savings of 80% compared to SAGD.[66] Froth treatment[edit] This section is an excerpt from Froth treatment (Athabasca oil sands)[edit] Bitumen froth treatment is a process used in the Athabasca oil sands (AOS) bitumen recovery operations to remove fine inorganics—water and mineral particles—from bitumen froth, by diluting the bitumen with a light hydrocarbon solvent—either naphthenic or paraffinic—to reduce the viscosity of the froth and to remove contaminants that were not removed in previous water-based gravity recovery phases.[67] Bitumen with a high viscosity or with too many contaminants, is not suitable for transporting through pipelines or refining. The original and conventional naphthenic froth treatment (NFT) uses a naphtha solvent with the addition of chemicals. Paraffinic Solvent Froth Treatment (PSFT), which was first used commercially in the Albian Sands in the early 2000s, results in a cleaner bitumen with lower levels of contaminates, such as water and mineral solids.[68] Following froth treatments, bitumen can be further upgraded using ""heat to produce synthetic crude oil by means of a coker unit.""[68] Energy balance[edit] Main article: Natural gas in Canada See also: Shale gas, Shale gas in the United States, and Shale gas in Canada Approximately 1.0–1.25 gigajoules (280–350 kWh) of energy is needed to extract a barrel of bitumen and upgrade it to synthetic crude. As of 2006, most of this is produced by burning natural gas.[69] Since a barrel of oil equivalent is about 6.117 gigajoules (1,699 kWh), its EROEI is 5–6. That means this extracts about 5 or 6 times as much energy as is consumed. Energy efficiency is expected to improve to an average of 900 cubic feet (25 m3) of natural gas or 0.945 gigajoules (262 kWh) of energy per barrel by 2015, giving an EROEI of about 6.5.[70] Alternatives to natural gas exist and are available in the oil sands area. Bitumen can itself be used as the fuel, consuming about 30–35% of the raw bitumen per produced unit of synthetic crude. Nexen's Long Lake project will use a proprietary deasphalting technology to upgrade the bitumen, using asphaltene residue fed to a gasifier whose syngas will be used by a cogeneration turbine and a hydrogen producing unit, providing all the energy needs of the project: steam, hydrogen, and electricity.[71] Thus, it will produce syncrude without consuming natural gas, but the capital cost is very high. Shortages of natural gas for project fuel were forecast to be a problem for Canadian oil sands production a few years ago, but recent increases in US shale gas production have eliminated much of the problem for North America. With the increasing use of hydraulic fracturing making US largely self-sufficient in natural gas and exporting more natural gas to Eastern Canada to replace Alberta gas, the Alberta government is using its powers under the NAFTA and the Canadian Constitution to reduce shipments of natural gas to the US and Eastern Canada, and divert the gas to domestic Alberta use, particularly for oil sands fuel. The natural gas pipelines to the east and south are being converted to carry increasing oil sands production to these destinations instead of gas. Canada also has huge undeveloped shale gas deposits in addition to those of the US, so natural gas for future oil sands production does not seem to be a serious problem. The low price of natural gas as the result of new production has considerably improved the economics of oil sands production. Upgrading and/or blending[edit] See also: Upgrader The extra-heavy crude oil or crude bitumen extracted from oil sands is a very viscous semisolid form of oil that does not easily flow at normal temperatures, making it difficult to transport to market by pipeline. To flow through oil pipelines, it must either be upgraded to lighter synthetic crude oil (SCO), blended with diluents to form dilbit, or heated to reduce its viscosity. Canada[edit] In the Canadian oil sands, bitumen produced by surface mining is generally upgraded on-site and delivered as synthetic crude oil. This makes delivery of oil to market through conventional oil pipelines quite easy. On the other hand, bitumen produced by the in-situ projects is generally not upgraded but delivered to market in raw form. If the agent used to upgrade the bitumen to synthetic crude is not produced on site, it must be sourced elsewhere and transported to the site of upgrading. If the upgraded crude is being transported from the site by pipeline, and additional pipeline will be required to bring in sufficient upgrading agent. The costs of production of the upgrading agent, the pipeline to transport it and the cost to operate the pipeline must be calculated into the production cost of the synthetic crude. Upon reaching a refinery, the synthetic crude is processed and a significant portion of the upgrading agent will be removed during the refining process. It may be used for other fuel fractions, but the end result is that liquid fuel has to be piped to the upgrading facility simply to make the bitumen transportable by pipeline. If all costs are considered, synthetic crude production and transfer using bitumen and an upgrading agent may prove economically unsustainable. When the first oil sands plants were built over 50 years ago, most oil refineries in their market area were designed to handle light or medium crude oil with lower sulfur content than the 4–7% that is typically found in bitumen. The original oil sands upgraders were designed to produce a high-quality synthetic crude oil (SCO) with lower density and lower sulfur content. These are large, expensive plants which are much like heavy oil refineries. Research is currently being done on designing simpler upgraders which do not produce SCO but simply treat the bitumen to reduce its viscosity, allowing to be transported unblended like conventional heavy oil. Western Canadian Select, launched in 2004 as a new heavy oil stream, blended at the Husky Energy terminal in Hardisty, Alberta,[72] is the largest crude oil stream coming from the Canadian oil sands and the benchmark for emerging heavy, high TAN (acidic) crudes.[73][74]:9[75][76] Western Canadian Select (WCS) is traded at Cushing, Oklahoma, a major oil supply hub connecting oil suppliers to the Gulf Coast, which has become the most significant trading hub for crude oil in North America. While its major component is bitumen, it also contains a combination of sweet synthetic and condensate diluents, and 25 existing streams of both conventional and unconventional oil[77] making it a syndilbit— both a dilbit and a synbit.[78]:16 The first step in upgrading is vacuum distillation to separate the lighter fractions. After that, de-asphalting is used to separate the asphalt from the feedstock. Cracking is used to break the heavier hydrocarbon molecules down into simpler ones. Since cracking produces products which are rich in sulfur, desulfurization must be done to get the sulfur content below 0.5% and create sweet, light synthetic crude oil.[79] In 2012, Alberta produced about 1,900,000 bbl/d (300,000 m3/d) of crude bitumen from its three major oil sands deposits, of which about 1,044,000 bbl/d (166,000 m3/d) was upgraded to lighter products and the rest sold as raw bitumen. The volume of both upgraded and non-upgraded bitumen is increasing yearly. Alberta has five oil sands upgraders producing a variety of products. These include:[80][81] Suncor Energy can upgrade 440,000 bbl/d (70,000 m3/d) of bitumen to light sweet and medium sour synthetic crude oil (SCO), plus produce diesel fuel for its oil sands operations at the upgrader. Syncrude can upgrade 407,000 bbl/d (64,700 m3/d) of bitumen to sweet light SCO. Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNRL) can upgrade 141,000 bbl/d (22,400 m3/d) of bitumen to sweet light SCO. Nexen, since 2013 wholly owned by China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), can upgrade 72,000 bbl/d (11,400 m3/d) of bitumen to sweet light SCO. Shell Canada operates its Scotford Upgrader in combination with an oil refinery and chemical plant at Scotford, Alberta, near Edmonton. The complex can upgrade 255,000 bbl/d (40,500 m3/d) of bitumen to sweet and heavy SCO as well as a range of refinery and chemical products. Modernized and new large refineries such as are found in the Midwestern United States and on the Gulf Coast of the United States, as well as many in China, can handle upgrading heavy oil themselves, so their demand is for non-upgraded bitumen and extra-heavy oil rather than SCO. The main problem is that the feedstock would be too viscous to flow through pipelines, so unless it is delivered by tanker or rail car, it must be blended with diluent to enable it to flow. This requires mixing the crude bitumen with a lighter hydrocarbon diluent such as condensate from gas wells, pentanes and other light products from oil refineries or gas plants, or synthetic crude oil from oil sands upgraders to allow it to flow through pipelines to market. Typically, blended bitumen contains about 30% natural gas condensate or other diluents and 70% bitumen. Alternatively, bitumen can also be delivered to market by specially designed railway tank cars, tank trucks, liquid cargo barges, or ocean-going oil tankers. These do not necessarily require the bitumen be blended with diluent since the tanks can be heated to allow the oil to be pumped out. The demand for condensate for oil sands diluent is expected to be more than 750,000 bbl/d (119,000 m3/d) by 2020, double 2012 volumes. Since Western Canada only produces about 150,000 bbl/d (24,000 m3/d) of condensate, the supply was expected to become a major constraint on bitumen transport. However, the recent huge increase in US tight oil production has largely solved this problem, because much of the production is too light for US refinery use but ideal for diluting bitumen. The surplus American condensate and light oil is being exported to Canada and blended with bitumen, and then re-imported to the US as feedstock for refineries. Since the diluent is simply exported and then immediately re-imported, it is not subject to the US ban on exports of crude oil. Once it is back in the US, refineries separate the diluent and re-export it to Canada, which again bypasses US crude oil export laws since it is now a refinery product. To aid in this process, Kinder Morgan Energy Partners is reversing its Cochin Pipeline, which used to carry propane from Edmonton to Chicago, to transport 95,000 bbl/d (15,100 m3/d) of condensate from Chicago to Edmonton by mid-2014; and Enbridge is considering the expansion of its Southern Lights pipeline, which currently ships 180,000 bbl/d (29,000 m3/d) of diluent from the Chicago area to Edmonton, by adding another 100,000 bbl/d (16,000 m3/d).[82] Venezuela[edit] Although Venezuelan extra-heavy oil is less viscous than Canadian bitumen, much of the difference is due to temperature. Once the oil comes out of the ground and cools, it has the same difficulty in that it is too viscous to flow through pipelines. Venezuela is now producing more extra heavy crude in the Orinoco oil sands than its four upgraders, which were built by foreign oil companies over a decade ago, can handle. The upgraders have a combined capacity of 630,000 bbl/d (100,000 m3/d), which is only half of its production of extra-heavy oil. In addition Venezuela produces insufficient volumes of naphtha to use as diluent to move extra-heavy oil to market. Unlike Canada, Venezuela does not produce much natural gas condensate from its own gas wells, and unlike Canada, it does not have easy access to condensate from new US shale gas production. Since Venezuela also has insufficient refinery capacity to supply its domestic market, supplies of naptha are insufficient to use as pipeline diluent, and it is having to import naptha to fill the gap. Since Venezuela also has financial problems – as a result of the country's economic crisis -, and political disagreements with the US government and oil companies, the situation remains unresolved.[83] Transportation[edit] See also: Oil pipeline A network of gathering and feeder pipelines collects crude bitumen and SCO from Alberta's northern oil sands deposits (primarily Athabasca, Cold Lake, and Peace River), and feeds them into two main collection points for southbound deliveries: Edmonton, Alberta and Hardisty, Alberta. Most of the feeder pipelines move blended bitumen or SCO southbound and diluent northbound, but a few move product laterally within the oil sands region. In 2012, the capacity of the southbound feeder lines was over 300,000 m³/d (2 million bbl/d) and more capacity was being added. The building of new oil sands feeder pipelines requires only the approval of the Alberta Energy Regulator, an agency that deals with matters entirely within Alberta and is likely to give little consideration to interference from political and environmental interest from outside Alberta.[84] Existing pipelines[edit] From Edmonton and Hardisty, main transmission pipelines move blended bitumen and SCO, as well as conventional crude oil and various oil and natural productions to market destinations across North America. The main transmission systems include:[84] Enbridge has a complex existing system of pipelines that takes crude oil from Edmonton and Hardisty east to Montreal and south as far as the Gulf Coast of the United States, with a total capacity of 2.5×10^6 bbl/d (400,000 m3/d). It also has a northbound pipeline that takes diluent from refineries in Illinois and other Midwestern states to Edmonton with a capacity of 160,000 bbl/d (25,000 m3/d) of light hydrocarbons. Kinder Morgan has the Trans Mountain Pipeline that takes crude oil from Edmonton over the Rocky Mountains to the west coasts of British Columbia and Washington State, with an existing capacity of 300,000 bbl/d (48,000 m3/d). It has plans to add an additional 450,000 bbl/d (72,000 m3/d) of capacity to this pipeline within the existing pipeline easement. Spectra Energy has a system of pipelines that takes crude oil from Hardisty south to Casper, Wyoming and then east to Wood River, Illinois. The first segment has a capacity of 280,000 bbl/d (45,000 m3/d) and the second segment 160,000 bbl/d (25,000 m3/d). TransCanada Corporation has the Keystone Pipeline system. Phase 1 currently takes crude oil from Hardisty south to Steele City, Nebraska and then east to Wood River, Illinois. The existing Phase 2 moves crude oil from Steele City to the main US oil marketing hub at Cushing, Oklahoma. Phases 1 and 2 have a combined capacity of 590,000 bbl/d (94,000 m3/d). Overall, the total pipeline capacity for the movement of crude oil from Edmonton and Hardisty to the rest of North America is about 3.5×10^6 bbl/d (560,000 m3/d). However, other substances such as conventional crude oil and refined petroleum products also share this pipeline network. The rapidly increasing tight oil production from the Bakken formation of North Dakota also competes for space on the Canadian export pipeline system. North Dakota oil producers are using the Canadian pipelines to deliver their oil to US refineries. In 2012, the Canadian export pipeline system began to become overloaded with new oil production. As a result, Enbridge implemented pipeline apportionment on its southbound lines, and Kinder Morgan on its westbound line. This rationed pipeline space by reducing the monthly allocation of each shipper to a certain percentage of its requirements. The Chevron Corporation Burnaby Refinery, the last remaining oil refinery on Canada's west coast, applied to the NEB for preferential access to Canadian oil since American refineries in Washington and California were outbidding it for pipeline space, but was denied because it would violate NAFTA equal access to energy rules. Similarly, new North Dakota tight oil production began to block new Canadian production from using the Enbridge, Kinder Morgan, and TransCanada southbound systems.[80] In addition, the US oil marketing hub at Cushing was flooded with new oil because most new North American production from Canada, North Dakota, and Texas converged at that point, and there was insufficient capacity to take it from there to refineries on the Gulf Coast, where half of US oil refinery capacity is located. The American pipeline system is designed to take imported oil from the Gulf Coast and Texas to the refineries in the northern US, and the new oil was flowing in the opposite direction, toward the Gulf Coast. The price of West Texas Intermediate delivered at Cushing, which is the main benchmark for US oil prices, fell to unprecedented low levels below other international benchmark oils such as Brent Crude and Dubai Crude. Since the price of WTI at Cushing is usually quoted by US media as the price of oil, this gave many Americans a distorted view of world oil prices as being lower than they were, and the supply being better than it was internationally. Canada used to be in a similar position to the US in that offshore oil was cheaper than domestic oil, so the oil pipelines used to run westward from the east coast to Central Canada, now they are being reversed to carry cheaper domestic oil sands production from Alberta to the east coast. New pipelines[edit] Lack of access to markets, limited export capacity, and oversupply in the US market have been a problem for oil sands producers in recent years. They have caused lower prices to Canadian oil sands producers and reduced royalty and tax revenues to Canadian governments. The pipeline companies have moved forward with a number of solutions to the transportation problems:[80] Enbridge's line from Sarnia, Ontario to Westover, Ontario near the head of Lake Erie has been reversed. This line used to take offshore oil to refineries in the Sarnia area. Now it takes Alberta SCO and blended bitumen to most refineries in Ontario. Enbridge has applied to reverse its line from Westover to Montreal, Quebec. This line used to take offshore oil to refineries in southern Ontario. After reversal, it will take Alberta SCO and bitumen to Montreal. Since Suncor Energy owns a very large oil sands mine and upgrader in Alberta and also owns a large oil refinery in Montreal, it finds this project appealing. The alternative is closing the refinery since it is noncompetitive using offshore oil. TransCanada is evaluating converting part of its mainline natural gas transmission system from western Canada to eastern North America to transport oil. Eastern North America is well supplied with natural gas as a result of the recent increases in US shale gas production, but has problems with oil supply since most of their oil comes from offshore. Enbridge's Seaway Pipeline which used to take oil from the US Gulf Coast to the oil trading hub at Cushing was reversed in 2012 to take oil from Cushing to the Coast, helping to alleviate the bottleneck at Cushing. It has a capacity of 400,000 bbl/d (64,000 m3/d) but Enbridge is twinning the pipeline to add an additional 400,000 bbl/d (64,000 m3/d). Following the denial of a US regulatory permit for its Keystone XL pipeline, TransCanada went ahead with the southern leg of the Keystone project. This will deliver 830,000 bbl/d (132,000 m3/d) from Cushing to the Coast. Since it is entirely within the states of Oklahoma and Texas, it does not require US federal government approval. Future pipelines[edit] With the main constraint on Canadian oil sands development becoming the availability of export pipeline capacity, pipeline companies have proposed a number of major new transmission pipelines. Many of these became stalled in government regulatory processes, both by the Canadian and American governments. Another factor is competition for pipeline space from rapidly increasing tight oil production from North Dakota, which under NAFTA trade rules has equal access to Canadian pipelines.[80] Enbridge has announced its intention to expand its Alberta Clipper line from 450,000 bbl/d (72,000 m3/d) to 570,000 bbl/d (91,000 m3/d) and its Southern Access line from 400,000 bbl/d (64,000 m3/d) to 560,000 bbl/d (89,000 m3/d). It is also proposing to build a Flanagan South line with an initial capacity of 585,000 bbl/d (93,000 m3/d) expandable to 800,000 bbl/d (130,000 m3/d). Enbridge is proposing to build the Northern Gateway Pipeline from Bruderheim, near Edmonton, Alberta to the port of Kitimat, BC for loading on supertankers with an initial capacity of 525,000 bbl/d (83,500 m3/d) with a reverse flow condensate pipeline to take diluent from tankers at Kitimat to Alberta. This was approved by the Canadian federal cabinet on 17 June 2014, subject to 209 conditions. After this point, the company has to satisfy most of the conditions to National Energy Board satisfaction before construction can start. Satisfying the conditions is expected to take a year or more. The leaders of both main opposition parties promised to reverse the decision if they form the government in the 2015 election.[85] This in fact occurred, as the Liberal party under Justin Trudeau won a majority government.[86] Kinder Morgan is proposing to increase the capacity of its Trans Mountain pipeline through British Columbia to 900,000 bbl/d (140,000 m3/d) by 2017. Kinder Morgan is also proposing to build the Trans Mountain Expansion pipeline which will add 550,000 bbl/d (87,000 m3/d) of capacity to the West Coast of Canada and the US. TransCanada has proposed the construction of the Keystone XL extension to its Keystone Pipeline which would add 700,000 bbl/d (110,000 m3/d) of capacity from Alberta to the US Gulf Coast. On 6 November 2015, American president Barack Obama announced that the State Department had rejected the proposed expansion.[87] TransCanada has also proposed to build the 4,600 km (2,900 mi) Energy East Pipeline, which would carry 1.1×10^6 bbl/d (170,000 m3/d) of oil from Alberta to refineries in Eastern Canada, including Quebec and New Brunswick. It would also have marine facilities that would enable Alberta production to be delivered to Atlantic markets by oil tanker.[88] The Irving Oil Refinery in New Brunswick, which is the largest oil refinery in Canada, is especially interested in it since its traditional sources such as North Sea oil are shrinking and international oil is more expensive than Alberta oil delivered to the Atlantic coast. In addition, there are a large number of new pipelines proposed for Alberta. These will likely be approved rapidly by the Alberta Energy Regulator, so there are likely to be few capacity problems within Alberta. Rail[edit] The movement of crude oil by rail is far from new, but it is now a rapidly growing market for North American railroads. The growth is driven by several factors. One is that the transmission pipelines from Alberta are operating at or near capacity and companies who cannot get pipeline space have to move oil by rail instead. Another is that many refineries on the east, west, and Gulf coasts of North America are under-served by pipelines since they assumed that they would obtain their oil by ocean tanker. Producers of new oil in Alberta, North Dakota, and West Texas are now shipping oil by rail to coastal refiners who are having difficulty obtaining international oil at prices competitive with those in the interior of North America. In addition, crude bitumen can be loaded directly into tank cars equipped with steam heating coils, avoiding the need for blending it with expensive condensate in order to ship it to market. Tank cars can also be built to transport condensate on the back-haul from refineries to the oil sands to make additional revenue rather than returning empty.[84] A single-track rail line carrying 10 trains per day, each with 120 tank cars, can move 630,000 bbl/d (100,000 m3/d) to 780,000 bbl/d (124,000 m3/d), which is the capacity of a large transmission pipeline. This would require 300 locomotives and 18,000 tank cars, which is a small part of the fleet of a Class 1 railroad. By comparison, the two Canadian Class 1 railways, Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) and Canadian National Railway (CN), have 2,400 locomotives and 65,000 freight cars between them, and CP moves 30–35 trains per day on its main line to Vancouver. Two US Class 1 railways, Union Pacific Railroad (UP) and BNSF Railway handle more than 100 trains per day on their western corridors.[84] CN Rail has said that it could move 1,500,000 bbl/d (240,000 m3/d) of bitumen from Edmonton to the deepwater port of Prince Rupert, BC if the Northern Gateway Pipeline from Edmonton to the port of Kitimat, BC was not approved. With many of their lines being underused, railroads find transporting crude oil an attractive source of revenue. With enough new tank cars they could carry all the new oil being produced in North America, albeit at higher prices than pipelines. In the short term, the use of rail will probably continue to grow as producers try to bypass short-term pipeline bottlenecks to take advantage of higher prices in areas with refineries capable of handling heavier crudes. In the long term the growth in rail transport will largely depend on the continued pipeline bottlenecks due to increased production in North America and regulatory delays for new pipelines. At present rail moves over 90,000 bbl/d (14,000 m3/d) of crude oil, and with continued growth in oil production and building of new terminals, rail movements will probably continue to grow into the foreseeable future.[80] By 2013, exports of oil from Canada to the US by rail had increased 9-fold in less than two years, from 16,000 bbl/d (2,500 m3/d) in early 2012 to 146,000 bbl/d (23,200 m3/d) in late 2013, mainly because new export pipelines had been held up by regulatory delays. As a result, Canadian farmers suffered an acute shortage of rail capacity to export their grains because so much of Canada's rail capacity was tied up by oil products. The safety of rail transport of oil was being called into question after several derailments, especially after a train with 74 tank cars of oil derailed and caught fire in Lac Megantic, Quebec.[89] See also: Lac-Megantic derailment The ensuing explosion and firestorm burned down 40 buildings in the town center and killed 47 people. The cleanup of the derailment area could take 5 years, and another 160 buildings may need to be demolished. Ironically, the oil was not Canadian bitumen being exported to the United States but Bakken formation light crude oil being imported into Canada from North Dakota to the Irving Oil Refinery in New Brunswick. Although near a huge oil import port on the Atlantic Ocean, the Irving refinery is importing US Bakken oil by rail because oil from outside North America is too expensive to be economic, and there are no pipelines to deliver heavier but cheaper Western Canadian oil to New Brunswick. It was subsequently pointed out that the Bakken light oil was much more flammable than Alberta bitumen, and the rail cars were mislabeled by the North Dakota producers as to their flammability. By 2014, the movement of crude by rail had become very profitable to oil companies. Suncor Energy, Canada's largest oil company declared record profits and attributed much of it to transporting oil to market by rail. It was moving about 70,000 bbl/d (11,000 m3/d) to Cushing, Oklahoma, and putting it into TransCanada's new Gulf Coast pipeline – which was originally going to be the southern leg of the Keystone XL pipeline, before the northern leg across the border from Canada was stalled by US federal government delays.[90] Suncor has also been moving 20,000 bbl/d (3,200 m3/d) of Alberta bitumen and North Dakota tight oil by rail to its Montreal Refinery with plans to increase it to 35,000 bbl/d (5,600 m3/d). Suncor claimed this saved about $10/bbl off the price of buying offshore oil. However, it was also anticipating the reversal of Enbridge's Line 9 from southwestern Ontario to Montreal to deliver 300,000 bbl/d (48,000 m3/d) oil even cheaper. Suncor has been considering adding a coker to its Montreal refinery to upgrade heavy oil sands bitumen, which would be cheaper than adding another upgrader to its oil sands operation. It was also shipping marine cargoes on an ""opportunistic basis"" from Texas and Louisiana ""at significant discounts to the international crudes we would typically run in Montreal"", thereby taking advantage of the recent US tight oil glut in addition to increased supplies of cheap Canadian oil sands bitumen.[91] Refining[edit] See also: oil refinery Heavy crude oil feedstock#crude feedstock needs pre-processing before it is fit for conventional refineries, although heavy oil and bitumen refineries can do the pre-processing themselves. This pre-processing is called 'upgrading', the key components of which are as follows: removal of water, sand, physical waste, and lighter products catalytic purification by hydrodemetallisation (HDM), hydrodesulfurization (HDS) and hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) hydrogenation through carbon rejection or catalytic hydrocracking (HCR) As carbon rejection is very inefficient and wasteful in most cases, catalytic hydrocracking is preferred in most cases. All these processes take large amounts of energy and water, while emitting more carbon dioxide than conventional oil. Catalytic purification and hydrocracking are together known as hydroprocessing. The big challenge in hydroprocessing is to deal with the impurities found in heavy crude, as they poison the catalysts over time. Many efforts have been made to deal with this to ensure high activity and long life of a catalyst. Catalyst materials and pore size distributions are key parameters that need to be optimized to deal with this challenge and varies from place to place, depending on the kind of feedstock present.[92] Canada[edit] There are four major oil refineries in Alberta which supply most of Western Canada with petroleum products, but as of 2012 these processed less than 1/4 of the approximately 1,900,000 bbl/d (300,000 m3/d) of bitumen and SCO produced in Alberta. Some of the large oil sands upgraders also produced diesel fuel as part of their operations. Some of the oil sands bitumen and SCO went to refineries in other provinces, but most of it was exported to the United States. The four major Alberta refineries are:[93] Suncor Energy operates the Petro-Canada refinery near Edmonton, which can process 142,000 bbl/d (22,600 m3/d) of all types of oil and bitumen into all types of products. Imperial Oil operates the Strathcona Refinery near Edmonton, which can process 187,200 bbl/d (29,760 m3/d) of SCO and conventional oil into all types of products. Shell Canada operates the Scotford Refinery near Edmonton, which is integrated with the Scotford Upgrader, and which can process 100,000 bbl/d (16,000 m3/d) of all types of oil and bitumen into all types of products. Husky Energy, operates the Husky Lloydminster Refinery in Lloydminster , which can process 28,300 bbl/d (4,500 m3/d) of feedstock from the adjacent Husky Upgrader into asphalt and other products. The $8.5-billion Sturgeon Refinery, a fifth major Alberta refinery, is under construction near Fort Saskatchewan with a completion date of 2017.[94][95] The Pacific Future Energy project proposed a new refinery in British Columbia that would process bitumen into fuel for Asian and Canadian markets. Pacific Future Energy proposes to transport near-solid bitumen to the refinery using railway tank cars.[96] Most of the Canadian oil refining industry is foreign-owned. Canadian refineries can process only about 25% of the oil produced in Canada. Canadian refineries, outside of Alberta and Saskatchewan, were originally built for light and medium crude oil. With new oil sands production coming on production at lower prices than international oil, market price imbalances have ruined the economics of refineries which could not process it. United States[edit] See also: List of oil refineries § United States, North American energy independence, and Western Canadian Select Prior to 2013, when China surpassed it, the United States was the largest oil importer in the world.[97] Unlike Canada, the US has hundreds of oil refineries, many of which have been modified to process heavy oil as US production of light and medium oil declined. The main market for Canadian bitumen as well as Venezuelan extra-heavy oil was assumed to be the US. The United States has historically been Canada's largest customer for crude oil and products, particularly in recent years. American imports of oil and products from Canada grew from 450,000 bbl/d (72,000 m3/d) in 1981 to 3,120,000 bbl/d (496,000 m3/d) in 2013 as Canada's oil sands produced more and more oil, while in the US, domestic production and imports from other countries declined.[98] However, this relationship is becoming strained due to physical, economic and political influences. Export pipeline capacity is approaching its limits; Canadian oil is selling at a discount to world market prices; US demand for crude oil and product imports has declined because of US economic problems; and US oil domestic unconventional oil production (shale oil production from fracking is growing rapidly. The US resumed export of crude oil in 2016; as of early 2019, the US produced as much oil as it consumed, with shale oil displacing Canadian imports. For the benefit of oil marketers, in 2004 Western Canadian producers created a new benchmark crude oil called Western Canadian Select, (WCS), a bitumen-derived heavy crude oil blend that is similar in its transportation and refining characteristics to California, Mexico Maya, or Venezuela heavy crude oils. This heavy oil has an API gravity of 19–21 and despite containing large amounts of bitumen and synthetic crude oil, flows through pipelines well and is classified as ""conventional heavy oil"" by governments. There are several hundred thousand barrels per day of this blend being imported into the US, in addition to larger amounts of crude bitumen and synthetic crude oil (SCO) from the oil sands. The demand from US refineries is increasingly for non-upgraded bitumen rather than SCO. The Canadian National Energy Board (NEB) expects SCO volumes to double to around 1,900,000 bbl/d (300,000 m3/d) by 2035, but not keep pace with the total increase in bitumen production. It projects that the portion of oil sands production that is upgraded to SCO to decline from 49% in 2010 to 37% in 2035. This implies that over 3,200,000 bbl/d (510,000 m3/d) of bitumen will have to be blended with diluent for delivery to market. See also: Petroleum Administration for Defense Districts Asia[edit] See also: Petroleum industry in China Demand for oil in Asia has been growing much faster than in North America or Europe. In 2013, China replaced the United States as the world's largest importer of crude oil, and its demand continues to grow much faster than its production. The main impediment to Canadian exports to Asia is pipeline capacity – The only pipeline capable of delivering oil sands production to Canada's Pacific Coast is the Trans Mountain Pipeline from Edmonton to Vancouver, which is now operating at its capacity of 300,000 bbl/d (48,000 m3/d) supplying refineries in B.C. and Washington State. However, once complete, the Northern Gateway pipeline and the Trans Mountain expansion currently undergoing government review are expected to deliver an additional 500,000 bbl/d (79,000 m3/d) to 1,100,000 bbl/d (170,000 m3/d) to tankers on the Pacific coast, from where they could deliver it anywhere in the world. There is sufficient heavy oil refinery capacity in China and India to refine the additional Canadian volume, possibly with some modifications to the refineries.[99] In recent years, Chinese oil companies such as China Petrochemical Corporation (Sinopec), China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), and PetroChina have bought over $30 billion in assets in Canadian oil sands projects, so they would probably like to export some of their newly acquired oil to China.[100] Economics[edit] The world's largest deposits of bitumen are in Canada, although Venezuela's deposits of extra-heavy crude oil are even bigger. Canada has vast energy resources of all types and its oil and natural gas resource base would be large enough to meet Canadian needs for generations if demand was sustained. Abundant hydroelectric resources account for the majority of Canada's electricity production and very little electricity is produced from oil. The National Energy Board (NEB) reported in 2013, that if oil prices are above US$100, Canada would have more than enough energy to meet its growing needs. The excess oil production from the oil sands could be exported. The major importing country would probably continue to be the United States, although before the developments in 2014, there was increasing demand for oil, particularly heavy oil, from Asian countries such as China and India.[101] Canada has abundant resources of bitumen and crude oil, with an estimated remaining ultimate resource potential of 54 billion cubic metres (340 billion barrels). Of this, oil sands bitumen accounts for 90 per cent. Alberta currently accounts for all of Canada's bitumen resources. ""Resources"" become ""reserves"" only after it is proven that economic recovery can be achieved. At 2013 prices using current technology, Canada had remaining oil reserves of 27 billion m3 (170 billion bbls), with 98% of this attributed to oil sands bitumen. This put its reserves in third place in the world behind Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. At the much lower prices of 2015, the reserves are much smaller.[citation needed] Costs[edit] The costs of production and transportation of saleable petroleum from oil sands is typically significantly higher than from conventional global sources.[102][103] Hence the economic viability of oil sands production is more vulnerable to the price of oil. The price of benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil at Cushing, Oklahoma above US$100/bbl that prevailed until late 2014 was sufficient to promote active growth in oil sands production. Major Canadian oil companies had announced expansion plans and foreign companies were investing significant amounts of capital, in many cases forming partnerships with Canadian companies. Investment had been shifting towards in-situ steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) projects and away from mining and upgrading projects, as oil sands operators foresee better opportunities from selling bitumen and heavy oil directly to refineries than from upgrading it to synthetic crude oil. Cost estimates for Canada include the effects of the mining when the mines are returned to the environment in ""as good as or better than original condition"". Cleanup of the end products of consumption are the responsibility of the consuming jurisdictions, which are mostly in provinces or countries other than the producing one. The Alberta government estimated that in 2012, the supply cost of oil sands new mining operations was $70 to $85 per barrel, whereas the cost of new SAGD projects was $50 to $80 per barrel.[80] These costs included capital and operating costs, royalties and taxes, plus a reasonable profit to the investors. Since the price of WTI rose to $100/bbl beginning in 2011,[104] production from oil sands was then expected to be highly profitable assuming the product could be delivered to markets. The main market was the huge refinery complexes on the US Gulf Coast, which are generally capable of processing Canadian bitumen and Venezuelan extra-heavy oil without upgrading. The Canadian Energy Research Institute (CERI) performed an analysis, estimating that in 2012 the average plant gate costs (including 10% profit margin, but excluding blending and transport) of primary recovery was $30.32/bbl, of SAGD was $47.57/bbl, of mining and upgrading was $99.02/bbl, and of mining without upgrading was $68.30/bbl.[105] Thus, all types of oil sands projects except new mining projects with integrated upgraders were expected to be consistently profitable from 2011 onward, provided that global oil prices remained favourable. Since the larger and more sophisticated refineries preferred to buy raw bitumen and heavy oil rather than synthetic crude oil, new oil sands projects avoided the costs of building new upgraders. Although primary recovery such as is done in Venezuela is cheaper than SAGD, it only recovers about 10% of the oil in place versus 60% or more for SAGD and over 99% for mining. Canadian oil companies were in a more competitive market and had access to more capital than in Venezuela, and preferred to spend that extra money on SAGD or mining to recover more oil. Then in late 2014 the dramatic rise in U.S. production from shale formations, combined with a global economic malaise that reduced demand, caused the price of WTI to drop below $50, where it remained as of late 2015.[106] In 2015, the Canadian Energy Research Institute (CERI) re-estimated the average plant gate costs (again including 10% profit margin) of SAGD to be $58.65/bbl, and 70.18/bbl for mining without upgrading. Including costs of blending and transportation, the WTI equivalent supply costs for delivery to Cushing become US$80.06/bbl for SAGD projects, and US$89.71/bbl for a standalone mine.[102] In this economic environment, plans for further development of production from oil sands have been slowed or deferred,[107] [108] or even abandoned during construction.[109] Production of synthetic crude from mining operations may continue at a loss because of the costs of shutdown and restart, as well as commitments to supply contracts.[110] During the 2020 Russia–Saudi Arabia oil price war, the price of Canadian heavy crude dipped below $5 per barrel.[111] Production forecasts[edit] Oil sands production forecasts released by the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP), the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER), and the Canadian Energy Research Institute (CERI) are comparable to National Energy Board (NEB) projections, in terms of total bitumen production. None of these forecasts take into account probable international constraints to be imposed on combustion of all hydrocarbons in order to limit global temperature rise, giving rise to a situation denoted by the term ""carbon bubble"".[112] Ignoring such constraints, and also assuming that the price of oil recovers from its collapse in late 2014, the list of currently proposed projects, many of which are in the early planning stages, would suggest that by 2035 Canadian bitumen production could potentially reach as much as 1.3 million m3/d (8.3 million barrels per day) if most were to go ahead. Under the same assumptions, a more likely scenario is that by 2035, Canadian oil sands bitumen production would reach 800,000 m3/d (5.0 million barrels/day), 2.6 times the production for 2012. The majority of the growth would likely occur in the in-situ category, as in-situ projects usually have better economics than mining projects. Also, 80% of Canada's oil sands reserves are well-suited to in-situ extraction, versus 20% for mining methods. An additional assumption is that there would be sufficient pipeline infrastructure to deliver increased Canadian oil production to export markets. If this were a limiting factor, there could be impacts on Canadian crude oil prices, constraining future production growth. Another assumption is that US markets will continue to absorb increased Canadian exports. Rapid growth of tight oil production in the US, Canada's primary oil export market, has greatly reduced US reliance on imported crude. The potential for Canadian oil exports to alternative markets such as Asia is also uncertain. There are increasing political obstacles to building any new pipelines to deliver oil in Canada and the US. In November 2015, U.S. President Barack Obama rejected the proposal to build the Keystone XL pipeline from Alberta to Steele City, Nebraska.[113] In the absence of new pipeline capacity, companies are increasingly shipping bitumen to US markets by railway, river barge, tanker, and other transportation methods. Other than ocean tankers, these alternatives are all more expensive than pipelines.[103] A shortage of skilled workers in the Canadian oil sands developed during periods of rapid development of new projects. In the absence of other constraints on further development, the oil and gas industry would need to fill tens of thousands of job openings in the next few years as a result of industry activity levels as well as age-related attrition. In the longer term, under a scenario of higher oil and gas prices, the labor shortages would continue to get worse. A potential labor shortage can increase construction costs and slow the pace of oil sands development.[101] The skilled worker shortage was much more severe in Venezuela because the government controlled oil company PDVSA fired most of its heavy oil experts after the Venezuelan general strike of 2002–03, and wound down the production of Orimulsion, which was the primary product from its oil sands. Following that, the government re-nationalized the Venezuelan oil industry and increased taxes on it. The result was that foreign companies left Venezuela, as did most of its elite heavy oil technical experts. In recent years, Venezuela's heavy oil production has been falling, and it has consistently been failing to meet its production targets. As of late 2015, development of new oil sand projects were deterred by the price of WTI below US$50, which is barely enough to support production from existing operations.[107] Demand recovery was suppressed by economic problems that may continue indefinitely to bedevil both the European Community and China. Low-cost production by OPEC continued at maximum capacity, efficiency of production from U.S. shales continued to improve, and Russian exports were mandated even below cost of production, as their only source of hard currency.[114] There is also the possibility that there will emerge an international agreement to introduce measures to constrain the combustion of hydrocarbons in an effort to limit global temperature rise to the nominal 2 °C that is consensually predicted to limit environmental harm to tolerable levels.[115] Rapid technological progress is being made to reduce the cost of competing renewable sources of energy.[116] Hence there is no consensus about when, if ever, oil prices paid to producers may substantially recover.[114][116][117] A detailed academic study of the consequences for the producers of the various hydrocarbon fuels concluded in early 2015 that a third of global oil reserves, half of gas reserves and over 80% of current coal reserves should remain underground from 2010 to 2050 in order to meet the target of 2 °C. Hence continued exploration or development of reserves would be extraneous to needs. To meet the 2 °C target, strong measures would be needed to suppress demand, such as a substantial carbon tax leaving a lower price for the producers from a smaller market. The impact on producers in Canada would be far larger than in the U.S. Open-pit mining of natural bitumen in Canada would soon drop to negligible levels after 2020 in all scenarios considered because it is considerably less economic than other methods of production.[118][119][120] Environmental issues[edit] See also: Environmental impact of the Athabasca oil sands and Environmental impact of the petroleum industry Play media Satellite images show the growth of pit mines over Canada's oil sands between 1984 and 2011. Demonstration of citizens against tar sands and the Keystone Pipeline. In their 2011 commissioned report entitled ""Prudent Development: Realizing the Potential of North America’s Abundant Natural Gas and Oil Resources,"" the National Petroleum Council, an advisory committee to the U.S. Secretary of Energy, acknowledged health and safety concerns regarding the oil sands which include ""volumes of water needed to generate issues of water sourcing; removal of overburden for surface mining can fragment wildlife habitat and increase the risk of soil erosion or surface run-off events to nearby water systems; GHG and other air emissions from production.""[121] Oil sands extraction can affect the land when the bitumen is initially mined, water resources by its requirement for large quantities of water during separation of the oil and sand, and the air due to the release of carbon dioxide and other emissions.[122] Heavy metals such as vanadium, nickel, lead, cobalt, mercury, chromium, cadmium, arsenic, selenium, copper, manganese, iron and zinc are naturally present in oil sands and may be concentrated by the extraction process.[123] The environmental impact caused by oil sand extraction is frequently criticized by environmental groups such as Greenpeace, Climate Reality Project, Pembina Institute, 350.org, MoveOn.org, League of Conservation Voters, Patagonia, Sierra Club, and Energy Action Coalition.[124][125] In particular, mercury contamination has been found around oil sands production in Alberta, Canada.[126] The European Union has indicated that it may vote to label oil sands oil as ""highly polluting"". Although oil sands exports to Europe are minimal, the issue has caused friction between the EU and Canada.[127] According to the California-based Jacobs Consultancy, the European Union used inaccurate and incomplete data in assigning a high greenhouse gas rating to gasoline derived from Alberta's oilsands. Also, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Russia do not provide data on how much natural gas is released via flaring or venting in the oil extraction process. The Jacobs report pointed out that extra carbon emissions from oil-sand crude are 12 percent higher than from regular crude, although it was assigned a GHG rating 22% above the conventional benchmark by EU.[128][129] In 2014 results of a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences showed that official reports on emissions were not high enough. Report authors noted that, ""emissions of organic substances with potential toxicity to humans and the environment are a major concern surrounding the rapid industrial development in the Athabasca oil sands region (AOSR)."" This study found that tailings ponds were an indirect pathway transporting uncontrolled releases of evaporative emissions of three representative polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)s (phenanthrene, pyrene, and benzo(a)pyrene) and that these emissions had been previously unreported.[130][131] Air pollution management[edit] The Alberta government computes an Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) from sensors in five communities in the oil sands region, operated by a ""partner"" called the Wood Buffalo Environmental Association (WBEA). Each of their 17 continuously monitoring stations measure 3 to 10 air quality parameters among carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), total reduced sulfur (TRS), Ammonia (NH3), nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), ozone (O3), particulate matter (PM2.5), sulfur dioxide (SO2), total hydrocarbons (THC), and methane/non-methane hydrocarbons (CH4/NMHC).[132] These AQHI are said to indicate ""low risk"" air quality more than 95% of the time.[133] Prior to 2012, air monitoring showed significant increases in exceedances of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) both in the Fort McMurray area and near the oil sands upgraders.[134] In 2007, the Alberta government issued an environmental protection order to Suncor in response to numerous occasions when ground level concentration for H2S) exceeded standards.[135] The Alberta Ambient Air Data Management System (AAADMS) of the Clean Air Strategic Alliance[136] (aka CASA Data Warehouse) records that, during the year ending on 1 November 2015, there were 6 hourly reports of values exceeding the limit of 10 ppb for H2S, and 4 in 2013, down from 11 in 2014, and 73 in 2012.[137] In September 2015, the Pembina Institute published a brief report about ""a recent surge of odour and air quality concerns in northern Alberta associated with the expansion of oilsands development"", contrasting the responses to these concerns in Peace River and Fort McKay. In Fort McKay, air quality is actively addressed by stakeholders represented in the WBEA, whereas the Peace River community must rely on the response of the Alberta Energy Regulator. In an effort to identify the sources of the noxious odours in the Fort McKay community, a Fort McKay Air Quality Index was established, extending the provincial Air Quality Health Index to include possible contributors to the problem: SO2, TRS, and THC. Despite these advantages, more progress was made in remediating the odour problems in the Peace River community, although only after some families had already abandoned their homes. The odour concerns in Fort McKay were reported to remain unresolved.[138] Land use and waste management[edit] A large part of oil sands mining operations involves clearing trees and brush from a site and removing the overburden— topsoil, muskeg, sand, clay and gravel – that sits atop the oil sands deposit.[139] Approximately 2.5 tons of oil sands are needed to produce one barrel of oil (roughly ⅛ of a ton).[140] As a condition of licensing, projects are required to implement a reclamation plan.[141] The mining industry asserts that the boreal forest will eventually colonize the reclaimed lands, but their operations are massive and work on long-term timeframes. As of 2013, about 715 square kilometres (276 sq mi) of land in the oil sands region have been disturbed, and 72 km2 (28 sq mi) of that land is under reclamation.[142] In March 2008, Alberta issued the first-ever oil sands land reclamation certificate to Syncrude for the 1.04 square kilometres (0.40 sq mi) parcel of land known as Gateway Hill approximately 35 kilometres (22 mi) north of Fort McMurray.[143] Several reclamation certificate applications for oil sands projects are expected within the next 10 years.[144] Water management[edit] Between 2 and 4.5 volume units of water are used to produce each volume unit of synthetic crude oil in an ex-situ mining operation. According to Greenpeace, the Canadian oil sands operations use 349×10^6 m3/a (12.3×10^9 cu ft/a) of water, twice the amount of water used by the city of Calgary.[145] However, in SAGD operations, 90–95% of the water is recycled and only about 0.2 volume units of water is used per volume unit of bitumen produced.[146] For the Athabasca oil sand operations water is supplied from the Athabasca River, the ninth longest river in Canada.[147] The average flow just downstream of Fort McMurray is 633 m3/s (22,400 cu ft/s) with its highest daily average measuring 1,200 m3/s (42,000 cu ft/s).[148][149] Oil sands industries water license allocations totals about 1.8% of the Athabasca river flow. Actual use in 2006 was about 0.4%.[150] In addition, according to the Water Management Framework for the Lower Athabasca River, during periods of low river flow water consumption from the Athabasca River is limited to 1.3% of annual average flow.[151] In December 2010, the Oil Sands Advisory Panel, commissioned by former environment minister Jim Prentice, found that the system in place for monitoring water quality in the region, including work by the Regional Aquatic Monitoring Program, the Alberta Water Research Institute, the Cumulative Environmental Management Association and others, was piecemeal and should become more comprehensive and coordinated.[152][153] Greenhouse gas emissions[edit] The production of bitumen and synthetic crude oil emits more greenhouse gases than the production of conventional crude oil. A 2009 study by the consulting firm IHS CERA estimated that production from Canada's oil sands emits ""about 5% to 15% more carbon dioxide, over the ""well-to-wheels"" (WTW) lifetime analysis of the fuel, than average crude oil.""[154] Author and investigative journalist David Strahan that same year stated that IEA figures show that carbon dioxide emissions from the oil sands are 20% higher than average emissions from the petroleum production.[155] A Stanford University study commissioned by the EU in 2011 found that oil sands crude was as much as 22% more carbon intensive than other fuels.[156][157] Greenpeace says the oil sands industry has been identified as the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions growth in Canada, as it accounts for 40 million tons of CO2 emissions per year.[158] According to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers and Environment Canada the industrial activity undertaken to produce oil sands make up about 5% of Canada's greenhouse gas emissions, or 0.1% of global greenhouse gas emissions. It predicts the oil sands will grow to make up 8% of Canada's greenhouse gas emissions by 2015.[159] While the production industrial activity emissions per barrel of bitumen produced decreased 26% over the decade 1992–2002, total emissions from production activity were expected to increase due to higher production levels.[160][161] As of 2006, to produce one barrel of oil from the oil sands released almost 75 kilograms (165 lb) of greenhouse gases with total emissions estimated to be 67 megatonnes (66,000,000 long tons; 74,000,000 short tons) per year by 2015.[162] A study by IHS CERA found that fuels made from Canadian oil sands resulted in significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions than many commonly cited estimates.[163] A 2012 study by Swart and Weaver estimated that if only the economically viable reserve of 170 Gbbl (27×10^9 m3) oil sands was burnt, the global mean temperature would increase by 0.02 to 0.05 °C. If the entire oil-in-place of 1.8 trillion barrels were to be burnt, the predicted global mean temperature increase is 0.24 to 0.50 °C.[164] Bergerson et al. found that while the WTW emissions can be higher than crude oil, the lower emitting oil sands cases can outperform higher emitting conventional crude cases.[165] To offset greenhouse gas emissions from the oil sands and elsewhere in Alberta, sequestering carbon dioxide emissions inside depleted oil and gas reservoirs has been proposed. This technology is inherited from enhanced oil recovery methods.[166] In July 2008, the Alberta government announced a C$2 billion fund to support sequestration projects in Alberta power plants and oil sands extraction and upgrading facilities.[167][168][169] In November 2014, Fatih Birol, the chief economist of the International Energy Agency, described additional greenhouse gas emissions from Canada's oil sands as ""extremely low"". The IEA forecasts that in the next 25 years oil sands production in Canada will increase by more than 3 million barrels per day (480,000 m3/d), but Dr. Birol said ""the emissions of this additional production is equal to only 23 hours of emissions of China — not even one day."" The IEA is charged with responsibility for battling climate change, but Dr. Birol said he spends little time worrying about carbon emissions from oil sands. ""There is a lot of discussion on oil sands projects in Canada and the United States and other parts of the world, but to be frank, the additional CO2 emissions coming from the oil sands is extremely low."" Dr. Birol acknowledged that there is tremendous difference of opinion on the course of action regarding climate change, but added, ""I hope all these reactions are based on scientific facts and sound analysis.""[170][171] In 2014, the U.S. Congressional Research Service published a report in preparation for the decision about permitting construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. The report states in part: ""Canadian oil sands crudes are generally more GHG emission-intensive than other crudes they may displace in U.S. refineries, and emit an estimated 17% more GHGs on a life-cycle basis than the average barrel of crude oil refined in the United States"".[172] According to Natural Resources Canada (NRCan), by 2017, the 23 percent increase in GHG emissions in Canada from 2005 to 2017, was ""largely from increased oil sands production, particularly in-situ extraction.""[8] Aquatic life deformities[edit] There is conflicting research on the effects of the oil sands development on aquatic life. In 2007, Environment Canada completed a study that shows high deformity rates in fish embryos exposed to the oil sands. David W. Schindler, a limnologist from the University of Alberta, co-authored a study on Alberta's oil sands' contribution of aromatic polycyclic compounds, some of which are known carcinogens, to the Athabasca River and its tributaries.[173] Scientists, local doctors, and residents supported a letter sent to the Prime Minister in September 2010 calling for an independent study of Lake Athabasca (which is downstream of the oil sands) to be initiated due to the rise of deformities and tumors found in fish caught there.[174] The bulk of the research that defends the oil sands development is done by the Regional Aquatics Monitoring Program (RAMP), whose steering committee is composed largely of oil and gas companies. RAMP studies show that deformity rates are normal compared to historical data and the deformity rates in rivers upstream of the oil sands. [175][176][177] Public health impacts[edit] In 2007, it was suggested that wildlife has been negatively affected by the oil sands; for instance, moose were found in a 2006 study to have as high as 453 times the acceptable levels of arsenic in their systems, though later studies lowered this to 17 to 33 times the acceptable level (although below international thresholds for consumption).[178] Concerns have been raised concerning the negative impacts that the oil sands have on public health, including higher than normal rates of cancer among residents of Fort Chipewyan.[179] However, John O'Connor, the doctor who initially reported the higher cancer rates and linked them to the oil sands development, was subsequently investigated by the Alberta College of Physicians and Surgeons. The College later reported that O'Connor's statements consisted of ""mistruths, inaccuracies and unconfirmed information.""[180] In 2010, the Royal Society of Canada released a report stating that ""there is currently no credible evidence of environmental contaminant exposures from oil sands reaching Fort Chipewyan at levels expected to cause elevated human cancer rates.""[180] In August 2011, the Alberta government initiated a provincial health study to examine whether a link exists between the higher rates of cancer and the oil sands emissions.[181] In a report released in 2014, Alberta's Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr. James Talbot, stated that ""There isn’t strong evidence for an association between any of these cancers and environmental exposure [to oil sands]."" Rather, Talbot suggested that the cancer rates at Fort Chipewyan, which were slightly higher compared with the provincial average, were likely due to a combination of factors such as high rates of smoking, obesity, diabetes, and alcoholism as well as poor levels of vaccination.[180] See also[edit] Energy portal Athabasca oil sands Beaver River sandstone Cold Lake oil sands History of the petroleum industry in Canada (oil sands and heavy oil) Melville Island oil sands Oil megaprojects Oil shale Organic-rich sedimentary rocks Orinoco Belt Peace River oil sands Petroleum industry Project Oilsand Pyrobitumen RAVEN (Respecting Aboriginal Values & Environmental Needs) Shale gas Steam injection (oil industry) Stranded asset Thermal depolymerization Utah oil sands Wabasca oil field World energy consumption Notes[edit] ^ The ""Middle East onshore market"" was the ""cheapest source of new oil volumes globally"" with the ""North American tight oil""—which includes onshore shale oil in the United States—in second place.The breakeven price for North American shale oil was US$68 a barrel in 2015, making it one of the most expensive to produce.

PERC Announces it’s 2021 Campus Sustainability Champions; Congratulations to ‘RayCycle The Campus Sustainability Champion title is awarded to students, faculty, administrators, and staff of Pennsylvania colleges and universities who have made meaningful contributions benefiting social, economic and/or environmental sustainability on their campus, in their community, or in society at large. Contributions can be in areas of teaching, research, co-curricular programs, campus culture, community service, and campus operations, including food recovery. Bucknell University Student Winners; ‘Raycycle initiative started out of Professor Kat Wakabayashi’s polymer engineering research lab in March 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic closed the Bucknell University campus. Eight research students (Philip Onffroy, Riley DeBaecke, Brooke Dickey, Jeffrey Gibbs, Prism Li, Rain Lu, Haley Scopelliti, and Kalie Yuen) decided to come together (‘Ray Bucknell!) to innovate while quarantining at home. With the general public use of disposable plastics (takeout containers, plastic bags, online shopping packaging) on the rise during the pandemic, Team ‘Raycycle decided to raise awareness of the consumption behavior and do its part in collecting and recycling some of the plastic materials, based on their research expertise. The team asked the Bucknell and surrounding community to take advantage of the stay-at-home period to collect several types of post-consumer plastics waste: grocery checkout bags, packaging air pillows, soda bottle caps, and single-use coffee pods. These plastic materials are often rejected at municipal and commercial recycling centers due to their cumbersome shapes and potential contamination levels.The community-driven plastics collection started in the spring of 2020, and through the summer, 3800+ pieces of plastics waste were pledged. When Bucknell campus reopened in fall of 2020, Team ‘Raycycle combined individual contributions and re-processed these “difficult-to-recycle” plastic waste into Bucknell Bison-themed products such as keychains and cookie cutters. The 100% recycled plastic products are given back to the individual community contributors as token of appreciation, and further given out to the rest of campus at sustainability and environmental awareness events and venues. The ‘Raycycle initiative was Bucknell’s community engagement at its best, backed by student motivation and University’s patented plastics processing technology.For more information, see: https://raycycle.scholar.bucknell.edu",Pennsylvania Environmental Resource Consortium

Food is distributed to the campus community and local residents by a sliding scale that Tilly devised with her interns, and they send excess produce to food pantries in the Ardmore area. Tilly has also been instrumental in the formation of a campus food pantry, set to open in Fall 2020. The food pantry will address food insecurity on campus and will feature farm-fresh produce. This project led the Haverfarm to work to install a high tunnel to increase production over the winter.

LongJune 17, 2020The Pennsylvania Environmental Resource Consortium (PERC) recently announced this year’s Campus Sustainability Champions (CSC) for Penn State, highlighting the contributions of students, staff and faculty for their work to advance sustainable development. This year’s selected student honoree for Penn State was Madison Mitchell, student and executive director for the Sustainability Institute’s Council of Sustainable Leaders (CSL). For the past year, Mitchell has led a cohort of student leaders in developing strategies to improve sustainability practices among students and the Penn State community while emphasizing one or more of the UN 17 Sustainable Development Goals. Some affiliate student organizations in CSL include the University Park Undergraduate Association, the Council of Commonwealth Student Governments, Lion Ambassadors, the Performing Arts Council and THON. Mitchell was recognized specifically for her leadership on student-engaged sustainability through her organization of the Sustainability Showcase Series, a weekly event traditionally held at the HUB at University Park and hosted virtually this spring. CSL began hosting the events in Fall 2017 with support from the Sustainability Institute and many other colleges and units throughout Penn State. An average of over 100 attended the events each week to hear from a variety of speakers, including Isaac Vergun, a youth climate activist and plaintiff in the Juliana v. United States federal climate lawsuit, business leaders from Perdue and PepsiCo, and Special Operations veterans with FORCE BLUE, a non-profit organization dedicated to marine conservation efforts. “I wasn’t expecting to be honored for my work,” said Mitchell. “I am very thankful to PERC for the recognition and for being able to work with such fantastic people at the who are truly dedicated to their work.” Andy Lau, associate professor of engineering, was also recognized as a 2020 honoree for his lifetime achievements in teaching, green building and solar energy. “It is an honor to be recognized for my life of commitment to learning and teaching how to live more lightly on Earth,” said Lau of being named a Campus Sustainability Champion this year. Robert Cooper, Mike Prinkey and Shelly McKeague, members of OPP’s Energy and Engineering team, were also among PERC's 2020 CSC honorees. The team brought together students, renewable energy experts, Sustainability Institute staff members, the Nature Conservancy and other industry professionals to develop and finalize a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a large-scale project to keep Penn State on track to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 35% by this year and by 85% by 2050, from its peak in 2005. One crucial consideration was cost; the team needed the price of solar generated electricity to be at or below breakeven with fossil fuel based generation, so utility costs would not increase and tuition would not be impacted. They also prioritized the enhancement of ecosystem benefits and minimization of site impacts, while improving soil health and creating wildlife habitat. In June of 2018, Penn State sent the RFP to 43 solar project developers and selected Lightsource bp as their partner to build, own and operate the large-scale solar project. Penn State will purchase 100% of the electricity, under a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) – providing Penn State with estimated of more than $14 million over the contract term. The project, which is currently under construction, consists of 150,000 solar panels that is expected to produce 25% of Penn State’s statewide electricity and prevent 57,000 tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere each year, while also serving as a home for ecological and solar research and teaching and providing incoming to landowners leasing their land for the project. “Penn State's solar project was a massive undertaking that our Energy and Engineering team could not have carried out without the participation and expertise offered by many talented Penn State students, faculty, staff, solar energy experts, and contractors,” said Cooper. “This project and the multi-faceted projects completed by the other PERC campus sustainability champions highlight the ingenuity of the environmental and sustainability research landscape found in higher education institutions across Pennsylvania.” PERC is an organization made up of 70 member and affiliate colleges and universities across Pennsylvania. The Campus Sustainability Champion title is awarded annually to students, faculty, administrators, and staff of Pennsylvania colleges and universities who have made meaningful contributions benefiting social, economic and/or environmental sustainability on their campus, in their community, or in society at large. The Campus Sustainability Champion award signifies outstanding leadership in the transition to a sustainable future. The full listing of honorees’ accomplishments can viewed at the PERC 2020 CSC page.

The Czech Republic,[a][11] also known by its short-form name, Czechia,[b][12] formerly known as Bohemia,[13] is a landlocked country in Central Europe. It is bordered by Austria to the south, Germany to the west, Poland to the northeast, and Slovakia to the east.[14] The Czech Republic has a hilly landscape that covers an area of 78,871 square kilometers (30,452 sq mi) with a mostly temperate continental and oceanic climate. The Duchy of Bohemia was founded in the late 9th century under Great Moravia. It was formally recognized as an Imperial State of the Holy Roman Empire in 1002 and became a kingdom in 1198.[15][16] Following the Battle of Mohács in 1526, the whole Crown of Bohemia was gradually integrated into the Habsburg Monarchy. The Protestant Bohemian Revolt led to the Thirty Years' War. After the Battle of the White Mountain, the Habsburgs consolidated their rule. With the dissolution of the Holy Empire in 1806, the Crown lands became part of the Austrian Empire. In the 19th century, the Czech lands became more industrialized, and in 1918 most of it became part of the First Czechoslovak Republic following the collapse of Austria-Hungary after World War I.[17] After the Munich Agreement in 1938, Nazi Germany systematically took control over the Czech lands. Czechoslovakia was restored in 1945 and became an Eastern Bloc communist state following a coup d'état in 1948. In November 1989, the Velvet Revolution ended communist rule in the country, and on 1 January 1993, Czechoslovakia was dissolved, with its constituent states becoming the independent states of the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The Czech Republic is a unitary parliamentary republic and developed country with an advanced, high-income social market economy. It is a welfare state with a European social model, universal health care and tuition-free university education. It ranks 12th in the UN inequality-adjusted human development and 14th in the World Bank Human Capital Index ahead of countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom and France. It ranks as the 11th safest and most peaceful country and 31st in democratic governance. The Czech Republic is a member of NATO, the EU, OECD, OSCE, and the CoE.

The current English name comes from the Polish ethnonym associated with the area, which ultimately comes from the Czech word Čech.[18][19][20] The name comes from the Slavic tribe (Czech: Češi, Čechové) and, according to legend, their leader Čech, who brought them to Bohemia, to settle on Říp Mountain. The etymology of the word Čech can be traced back to the Proto-Slavic root *čel-, meaning ""member of the people; kinsman"", thus making it cognate to the Czech word člověk (a person).[21] The country has been traditionally divided into three lands, namely Bohemia (Čechy) in the west, Moravia (Morava) in the east, and Czech Silesia (Slezsko; the smaller, south-eastern part of historical Silesia, most of which is located within modern Poland) in the northeast.[22] Known as the lands of the Bohemian Crown since the 14th century, a number of other names for the country have been used, including Czech/Bohemian lands, Bohemian Crown, Czechia[23] and the lands of the Crown of Saint Wenceslas. When the country regained its independence after the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian empire in 1918, the new name of Czechoslovakia was coined to reflect the union of the Czech and Slovak nations within one country.[24] After Czechoslovakia dissolved in 1992, the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommended Czechia for the English short name.[citation needed] This form was not adopted at the time, leading to the long name Czech Republic being used in all circumstances. The Czech government approved Czechia as the official short name in 2016.[25] The short name has been listed by the United Nations[26] and is used by other organisations such as the European Union,[27] CIA,[28] and Google Maps.[29] Geography Main article: Geography of the Czech Republic Topographic map The Czech Republic lies mostly between latitudes 48° and 51° N and longitudes 12° and 19° E. Bohemia, to the west, consists of a basin drained by the Elbe (Czech: Labe) and the Vltava rivers, surrounded by mostly low mountains, such as the Krkonoše range of the Sudetes. The highest point in the country, Sněžka at 1,603 m (5,259 ft), is located here. Moravia, the eastern part of the country, is also hilly. It is drained mainly by the Morava River, but it also contains the source of the Oder River (Czech: Odra). Water from the Czech Republic flows to three different seas: the North Sea, Baltic Sea, and Black Sea. The Czech Republic also leases the Moldauhafen, a 30,000-square-meter (7.4-acre) lot in the middle of the Hamburg Docks, which was awarded to Czechoslovakia by Article 363 of the Treaty of Versailles, to allow the landlocked country a place where goods transported down river could be transferred to seagoing ships. The territory reverts to Germany in 2028. Phytogeographically, the Czech Republic belongs to the Central European province of the Circumboreal Region, within the Boreal Kingdom. According to the World Wide Fund for Nature, the territory of the Czech Republic can be subdivided into four ecoregions: the Western European broadleaf forests, Central European mixed forests, Pannonian mixed forests, and Carpathian montane conifer forests.[30] There are four national parks in the Czech Republic. The oldest is Krkonoše National Park (Biosphere Reserve), and the others are Šumava National Park (Biosphere Reserve), Podyjí National Park, Bohemian Switzerland. The three historical lands of the Czech Republic (formerly some countries of the Bohemian Crown) correspond with the river basins of the Elbe and the Vltava basin for Bohemia, the Morava one for Moravia, and the Oder river basin for Czech Silesia (in terms of the Czech territory). Climate Köppen climate classification types of the Czech Republic using the 0°C isotherm   Humid continental climate   Subarctic climate Köppen climate classification types of the Czech Republic using the -3°C isotherm   Humid continental climate   Oceanic climate   Subarctic climate The Czech Republic has a temperate climate, situated in the transition zone between the oceanic and continental climate types, with warm summers and cold, cloudy and snowy winters. The temperature difference between summer and winter is due to the landlocked geographical position.[31] Temperatures vary depending on the elevation. In general, at higher altitudes, the temperatures decrease and precipitation increases. The wettest area in the Czech Republic is found around Bílý Potok in Jizera Mountains and the driest region is the Louny District to the northwest of Prague. Another factor is the distribution of the mountains. At the highest peak of Sněžka (1,603 m or 5,259 ft), the average temperature is −0.4 °C (31 °F), whereas in the lowlands of the South Moravian Region, the average temperature is as high as 10 °C (50 °F). The country's capital, Prague, has a similar average temperature, although this is influenced by urban factors. The coldest month is usually January, followed by February and December. During these months, there is snow in the mountains and sometimes in the cities and lowlands. During March, April, and May, the temperature usually increases, especially during April, when the temperature and weather tends to vary during the day. Spring is also characterized by higher water levels in the rivers, due to melting snow with occasional flooding. The warmest month of the year is July, followed by August and June. On average, summer temperatures are about 20–30 °C (36–54 °F) higher than during winter. Summer is also characterized by rain and storms. Autumn generally begins in September, which is still warm and dry. During October, temperatures usually fall below 15 °C (59 °F) or 10 °C (50 °F) and deciduous trees begin to shed their leaves. By the end of November, temperatures usually range around the freezing point. Northern Czech landscape during a summer morningKrkonoše mountains in winter The coldest temperature ever measured was in Litvínovice near České Budějovice in 1929, at −42.2 °C (−44.0 °F) and the hottest measured, was at 40.4 °C (104.7 °F) in Dobřichovice in 2012.[32] Most rain falls during the summer. Sporadic rainfall is throughout the year (in Prague, the average number of days per month experiencing at least 0.1 mm (0.0039 in) of rain varies from 12 in September and October to 16 in November) but concentrated rainfall (days with more than 10 mm (0.39 in) per day) are more frequent in the months of May to August (average around two such days per month).[33] Severe thunderstorms, producing damaging straight-line winds, hail, and occasional tornadoes occur, especially during the summer period.[34][35] Environment See also: Protected areas of the Czech Republic and Fauna of the Czech Republic The Czech Republic ranks as the 27th most environmentally conscious country in the world in Environmental Performance Index.[36] It had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 1.71/10, ranking it 160th globally out of 172 countries.[37] The Czech Republic has four National Parks (Šumava National Park, Krkonoše National Park, České Švýcarsko National Park, Podyjí National Park) and 25 Protected Landscape Areas. History Main article: History of the Czech lands Prehistory Left: Venus of Dolní Věstonice dated to 29,000–25,000 BCERight: The stone head of a Celt is among the archaeological collections of the National Museum.[38] Archaeologists have found evidence of prehistoric human settlements in the area, dating back to the Paleolithic era. In the classical era, as a result of the 3rd century BC Celtic migrations, Bohemia became associated with the Boii.[39] The Boii founded an oppidum near the site of modern Prague.[40] Later in the 1st century, the Germanic tribes of the Marcomanni and Quadi settled there.[41] Slavs from the Black Sea–Carpathian region settled in the area (their migration was pushed by an invasion of peoples from Siberia and Eastern Europe into their area:[42] Huns, Avars, Bulgars and Magyars).[43] In the sixth century, the Huns had moved westwards into Bohemia, Moravia, and some of present-day Austria and Germany.[43] During the 7th century, the Frankish merchant Samo, supporting the Slavs fighting against nearby settled Avars,[44] became the ruler of the first documented Slavic state in Central Europe, Samo's Empire. The principality of Great Moravia, controlled by Moymir dynasty, arose in the 8th century.[45] It reached its zenith in the 9th (during the reign of Svatopluk I of Moravia), holding off the influence of the Franks. Great Moravia was Christianized, with a role being played by the Byzantine mission of Cyril and Methodius. They codified the Old Church Slavonic language, the first literary and liturgical language of the Slavs, and the Glagolitic alphabet.[46] Bohemia Main article: Bohemia The Crown of Bohemia within the Holy Roman Empire (1600). The Czech lands were part of the Empire in 1002–1806, and Prague was the imperial seat in 1346–1437 and 1583–1611. The Duchy of Bohemia emerged in the late 9th century when it was unified by the Přemyslid dynasty. Bohemia was from 1002 until 1806 an Imperial State of the Holy Roman Empire.[47] In 1212, Přemysl Ottokar I extracted the Golden Bull of Sicily from the emperor, confirming Ottokar and his descendants' royal status; the Duchy of Bohemia was raised to a Kingdom.[48] German immigrants settled in the Bohemian periphery in the 13th century.[49] The Mongols in the invasion of Europe carried their raids into Moravia but were defensively defeated at Olomouc.[50] After a series of dynastic wars, the House of Luxembourg gained the Bohemian throne.[51] Efforts for a reform of the church in Bohemia started already in the late 14th century. Jan Hus's followers seceded from some practices of the Roman Church and in the Hussite Wars (1419–1434) defeated five crusades organized against them by Sigismund. During the next two centuries, 90% of the population in Bohemia and Moravia were considered Hussites. The pacifist thinker Petr Chelčický inspired the movement of the Bohemian Brethren (by the middle of the 15th century) that completely separated from the Roman Catholic Church.[52] Battle between Hussites and crusaders during the Hussite Wars; Jena Codex, 15th century After 1526 Bohemia came increasingly under Habsburg control as the Habsburgs became first the elected and then in 1627 the hereditary rulers of Bohemia. Between 1583 and 1611 Prague was the official seat of the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II and his court. The Defenestration of Prague and subsequent revolt against the Habsburgs in 1618 marked the start of the Thirty Years' War. In 1620, the rebellion in Bohemia was crushed at the Battle of White Mountain and the ties between Bohemia and the Habsburgs' hereditary lands in Austria were strengthened. The leaders of the Bohemian Revolt were executed in 1621. The nobility and the middle class Protestants had to either convert to Catholicism or leave the country.[53] In the ""Dark Age"" of 1620 to the late 18th century, the population of the Czech lands declined by a third through the expulsion of Czech Protestants as well as due to the war, disease and famine.[54] The Habsburgs prohibited all Christian confessions other than Catholicism.[55] The flowering of Baroque culture shows the ambiguity of this historical period. Ottoman Turks and Tatars invaded Moravia in 1663.[56] In 1679–1680 the Czech lands faced the Great Plague of Vienna and an uprising of serfs.[57] The 1618 Defenestration of Prague marked the beginning of the Bohemian Revolt against the Habsburgs and therefore the first phase of the Thirty Years' War. There were peasant uprisings influenced by famine.[58] Serfdom was abolished between 1781 and 1848. Several battles of the Napoleonic Wars took place on the current territory of the Czech Republic. The end of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806 led to degradation of the political status of Bohemia which lost its position of an electorate of the Holy Roman Empire as well as its own political representation in the Imperial Diet.[59] Bohemian lands became part of the Austrian Empire. During the 18th and 19th century the Czech National Revival began its rise, with the purpose to revive Czech language, culture, and national identity. The Revolution of 1848 in Prague, striving for liberal reforms and autonomy of the Bohemian Crown within the Austrian Empire, was suppressed.[60] It seemed that some concessions would be made also to Bohemia, but in the end, the Emperor Franz Joseph I affected a compromise with Hungary only. The Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 and the never realized coronation of Franz Joseph as King of Bohemia led to a disappointment of some Czech politicians.[60] The Bohemian Crown lands became part of the so-called Cisleithania. The Czech Social Democratic and progressive politicians started the fight for universal suffrage. The first elections under universal male suffrage were held in 1907.[61] Czechoslovakia Main article: History of Czechoslovakia The First Czechoslovak Republic comprised 27% of the population of the former Austria-Hungary and nearly 80% of the industry.[62]In 1918, during the collapse of the Habsburg Monarchy at the end of World War I, the independent republic of Czechoslovakia, which joined the winning Allied powers, was created, with Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk in the lead.[63] This new country incorporated the Bohemian Crown.[64] The First Czechoslovak Republic comprised only 27% of the population of the former Austria-Hungary, but nearly 80% of the industry, which enabled it to compete with Western industrial states.[62] In 1929 compared to 1913, the gross domestic product increased by 52% and industrial production by 41%. In 1938 Czechoslovakia held 10th place in the world industrial production.[65] Czechoslovakia was the only democracy in Central Europe during the interwar period.[66] Although the First Czechoslovak Republic was a unitary state, it provided certain rights to its minorities, the largest being Germans (23.6% in 1921), Hungarians (5.6%) and Ukrainians (3.5%).[67] Prague during the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia The Czech territory was occupied by Germany, which transformed it into the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. The protectorate was proclaimed part of the Third Reich, and the president and prime minister were subordinated to Nazi Germany's Reichsprotektor. One Nazi concentration camp was located within the Czech territory at Terezín, north of Prague. The Nazi Generalplan Ost called for the extermination, expulsion, Germanization or enslavement of most or all Czechs for the purpose of providing more living space for the German people.[68] There was Czechoslovak resistance to Nazi occupation as well as reprisals against the Czechoslovaks for their anti-Nazi resistance. The German occupation ended on 9 May 1945, with the arrival of the Soviet and American armies and the Prague uprising.[69] In the 1946 elections, the Communist Party gained 38%[70] of the votes and became the largest party in the Czechoslovak parliament, formed a coalition with other parties, and consolidated power. A coup d'état came in 1948 and a single-party government was formed. For the next 41 years, the Czechoslovak Communist state is characterized by certain Eastern Bloc's economic and political features.[71] The Prague Spring political liberalization was stopped by the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. Analysts believe that the invasion caused the communist movement to fracture, ultimately leading to the Revolutions of 1989. Czech Republic Main articles: Velvet Revolution and Dissolution of Czechoslovakia Václav Havel, playwright, former dissident, one of the most important figures in the history of the 20th century. Leader of the Velvet Revolution. The last president of Czechoslovakia and the first president of the Czech Republic. In November 1989, Czechoslovakia returned to a liberal democracy through the Velvet Revolution. However, Slovak national aspirations strengthened (Hyphen War) and on 1 January 1993, the country peacefully split into the independent countries of the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Both countries went through economic reforms and privatisations, with the intention of creating a market economy. This process was largely successful; in 2006 the Czech Republic was recognized by the World Bank as a ""developed country"",[72] and in 2009 the Human Development Index ranked it as a nation of ""Very High Human Development"".[73] From 1991, the Czech Republic, originally as part of Czechoslovakia and since 1993 in its own right, has been a member of the Visegrád Group and from 1995, the OECD. The Czech Republic joined NATO on 12 March 1999 and the European Union on 1 May 2004. On 21 December 2007 the Czech Republic joined the Schengen Area.[74] Until 2017, either the Czech Social Democratic Party or the Civic Democratic Party led the governments of the Czech Republic. In October 2017, populist movement ANO 2011, led by the country's second-richest man, Andrej Babiš, won the elections with three times more votes than its closest rival, the centre-right Civic Democrats.[75] In December 2017, Czech President Miloš Zeman appointed Andrej Babiš as the new Prime Minister. [76] Governance Main articles: Government of the Czech Republic and Politics of the Czech Republic PresidentMiloš Zeman Prime MinisterAndrej Babiš The Czech Republic is a pluralist multi-party parliamentary representative democracy. The Parliament (Parlament České republiky) is bicameral, with the Chamber of Deputies (Czech: Poslanecká sněmovna) (200 members) and the Senate (Czech: Senát) (81 members).[77] The members of the Chamber of Deputies are elected for a four-year term by proportional representation, with a 5% election threshold. There are 14 voting districts, identical to the country's administrative regions. The Chamber of Deputies, the successor to the Czech National Council, has the powers and responsibilities of the now defunct federal parliament of the former Czechoslovakia. The members of the Senate are elected in single-seat constituencies by two-round runoff voting for a six-year term, with one-third elected every even year in the autumn. This arrangement is modeled on the U.S. Senate, but each constituency is roughly the same size and the voting system used is a two-round runoff. The president is a formal head of state with limited and specific powers, who appoints the prime minister, as well the other members of the cabinet on a proposal by the prime minister. From 1993 until 2012, the President of the Czech Republic was selected by a joint session of the parliament for a five-year term, with no more than two consecutive terms (2x Václav Havel, 2x Václav Klaus). Since 2013 the presidential election is direct.[78] The Government's exercise of executive power derives from the Constitution. The members of the government are the Prime Minister, Deputy prime ministers and other ministers. The Government is responsible to the Chamber of Deputies.[79] The Prime Minister is the head of government and wields powers such as the right to set the agenda for most foreign and domestic policy and choose government ministers.[80] Main office holders Office Name Party Since President Miloš Zeman SPOZ 8 March 2013 President of the Senate Miloš Vystrčil ODS 19 February 2020 Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies Radek Vondráček ANO 22 November 2017 Prime Minister Andrej Babiš ANO 6 December 2017 Law Main articles: Law of the Czech Republic, Judiciary of the Czech Republic, and Law enforcement in the Czech Republic See also: Gun law in the Czech Republic and Self-defence (Czech Republic) Seat of the Supreme Administrative Court of the Czech Republic in Brno The Czech Republic is a unitary state,[81] with a civil law system based on the continental type, rooted in Germanic legal culture. The basis of the legal system is the Constitution of the Czech Republic adopted in 1993.[82] The Penal Code is effective from 2010. A new Civil code became effective in 2014. The court system includes district, county, and supreme courts and is divided into civil, criminal, and administrative branches. The Czech judiciary has a triumvirate of supreme courts. The Constitutional Court consists of 15 constitutional judges and oversees violations of the Constitution by either the legislature or by the government.[82] The Supreme Court is formed of 67 judges and is the court of highest appeal for most legal cases heard in the Czech Republic. The Supreme Administrative Court decides on issues of procedural and administrative propriety. It also has jurisdiction over certain political matters, such as the formation and closure of political parties, jurisdictional boundaries between government entities, and the eligibility of persons to stand for public office.[82] The Supreme Court and the Supreme Administrative Court are both based in Brno, as is the Supreme Public Prosecutor's Office.[82] Foreign relations Main article: Foreign relations of the Czech Republic See also: Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic Visa-free entry countries for Czech citizens in green, EU in blue (see citizenship of the European Union) The Czech Republic has ranked as one of the safest or most peaceful countries for the past few decades.[83] It is a member of the United Nations, the European Union, NATO, OECD, Council of Europe and is an observer to the Organization of American States.[84] The embassies of most countries with diplomatic relations with the Czech Republic are located in Prague, while consulates are located across the country. The Czech passport is restricted by visas. According to the 2018 Henley & Partners Visa Restrictions Index, Czech citizens have visa-free access to 173 countries, which ranks them 7th along with Malta and New Zealand.[85] The World Tourism Organization ranks the Czech passport 24th.[86] The US Visa Waiver Program applies to Czech nationals. The Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs have primary roles in setting foreign policy, although the President also has influence and represents the country abroad. Membership in the European Union and NATO is central to the Czech Republic's foreign policy. The Office for Foreign Relations and Information (ÚZSI) serves as the foreign intelligence agency responsible for espionage and foreign policy briefings, as well as protection of Czech Republic's embassies abroad. The Czech Republic has ties with Slovakia, Poland and Hungary as a member of the Visegrad Group,[87] as well as with Germany,[88] Israel,[89] the United States[90] and the European Union and its members. Czech officials have supported dissenters in Belarus, Moldova, Myanmar and Cuba.[91] Military Army soldiers during an exercise Main article: Army of the Czech Republic The Czech armed forces consist of the Czech Land Forces, the Czech Air Force and of specialized support units. The armed forces are managed by the Ministry of Defence. The President of the Czech Republic is Commander-in-chief of the armed forces. In 2004 the army transformed itself into a fully professional organization and compulsory military service was abolished. The country has been a member of NATO since 12 March 1999. Defence spending is approximately 1.19% of the GDP (2019).[92] The armed forces are charged with protecting the Czech Republic and its allies, promoting global security interests, and contributing to NATO. Currently, as a member of NATO, the Czech military are participating in the Resolute Support and KFOR operations and have soldiers in Afghanistan, Mali, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Egypt, Israel and Somalia. The Czech Air Force also served in the Baltic states and Iceland.[93] The main equipment of the Czech military includes JAS 39 Gripen multi-role fighters, Aero L-159 Alca combat aircraft, Mi-35 attack helicopters, armored vehicles (Pandur II, OT-64, OT-90, BVP-2) and tanks (T-72 and T-72M4CZ). Administrative divisions Main articles: Regions of the Czech Republic, Districts of the Czech Republic, and Obec Since 2000, the Czech Republic has been divided into thirteen regions (Czech: kraje, singular kraj) and the capital city of Prague. Every region has its own elected regional assembly and a regional governor. In Prague, the assembly and presidential powers are executed by the city council and the mayor. The older seventy-six districts (okresy, singular okres) including three ""statutory cities"" (without Prague, which had special status) lost most of their importance in 1999 in an administrative reform; they remain as territorial divisions and seats of various branches of state administration.[94] The smallest administrative units are obce (municipalities). As of 2021, the Czech Republic is divided into 6,254 municipalities. Cities and towns are also municipalities. The capital city of Prague is a region and municipality at the same time. Map of the Czech Republic with traditional regions and current administrative regionsMap with districts Economy Main article: Economy of the Czech Republic The Czech Republic is part of the European Single Market and the Schengen Area, but uses its own currency, the Czech koruna. The Czech Republic has a developed,[95] high-income[96] export-oriented social market economy based in services, manufacturing and innovation, that maintains a welfare state and the European social model.[97] The Czech Republic participates in the European Single Market as a member of the European Union and is therefore a part of the economy of the European Union, but uses its own currency, the Czech koruna, instead of the euro. It has a per capita GDP rate that is 91% of the EU average[98] and is a member of the OECD. Monetary policy is conducted by the Czech National Bank, whose independence is guaranteed by the Constitution. The Czech Republic ranks 12th in the UN inequality-adjusted human development and 14th in World Bank Human Capital Index. It was described by The Guardian as ""one of Europe's most flourishing economies"".[99] As of 2018[update], the country's GDP per capita at purchasing power parity is $37,370[100] and $22,850 at nominal value.[101] According to Allianz A.G., in 2018 the country was an MWC (mean wealth country), ranking 26th in net financial assets.[102] The country experienced a 4.5% GDP growth in 2017.[103] The 2016 unemployment rate was the lowest in the EU at 2.4%,[104] and the 2016 poverty rate was the second lowest of OECD members.[105] Czech Republic ranks 24th in both the Index of Economic Freedom[106] and the Global Innovation Index as of 2016[update],[107] 29th in the Global Competitiveness Report,[108] 30th in the ease of doing business index and 25th in the Global Enabling Trade Report.[109] The Czech Republic has a diverse economy that ranks 7th in the 2016 Economic Complexity Index.[110] The industrial sector accounts for 37.5% of the economy, while services account for 60% and agriculture for 2.5%.[111] The largest trading partner for both export and import is Germany and the EU in general. Dividends worth CZK 270 billion were paid to the foreign owners of Czech companies in 2017, which has become a political issue.[112] The country has been a member of the Schengen Area since 1 May 2004, having abolished border controls, completely opening its borders with all of its neighbors on 21 December 2007.[113] Industry In 2018 the largest companies by revenue in the Czech Republic were: one of the car automobile manufacturers in Central Europe Škoda Auto, utility company ČEZ Group, conglomerate Agrofert, energy trading company EPH, oil processing company Unipetrol, electronics manufacturer Foxconn CZ and steel producer Moravia Steel.[114] Other Czech transportation companies include: Škoda Transportation (tramways, trolleybuses, metro), Tatra (heavy trucks, the second oldest car maker in the world), Avia (medium trucks), Karosa and SOR Libchavy (buses), Aero Vodochody (military aircraft), Let Kunovice (civil aircraft), Zetor (tractors), Jawa Moto (motorcycles) and Čezeta (electric scooters). Škoda Transportation is the fourth largest tram producer in the world; nearly one third of all trams in the world come from Czech factories.[115] The Czech Republic is also the world's largest vinyl records manufacturer, with GZ Media producing about 6 million pieces annually in Loděnice.[116] Česká zbrojovka is among the ten largest firearms producers in the world and five who produce automatic weapons.[117] In the food industry succeeded companies Agrofert, Kofola and Hamé. Energy Main article: Energy in the Czech Republic Dukovany Nuclear Power Station Production of Czech electricity exceeds consumption by about 10 TWh per year, which are exported. Nuclear power presently provides about 30 percent of the total power needs, its share is projected to increase to 40 percent. In 2005, 65.4 percent of electricity was produced by steam and combustion power plants (mostly coal); 30 percent by nuclear plants; and 4.6 percent from renewable sources, including hydropower. The largest Czech power resource is Temelín Nuclear Power Station, with another nuclear power plant in Dukovany. The Czech Republic is reducing its dependence on highly polluting low-grade brown coal as a source of energy. Natural gas is procured from Russian Gazprom, roughly three-fourths of domestic consumption, and from Norwegian companies, which make up most of the remaining one-fourth. Russian gas is imported via Ukraine, Norwegian gas is transported through Germany. Gas consumption (approx. 100 TWh in 2003–2005) is almost double electricity consumption. South Moravia has small oil and gas deposits. Transportation infrastructure Main article: Transport in the Czech RepublicThe road network in the Czech Republic is 55,653 km (34,581.17 mi) long.[118] There are 1,232 km of motorways as of 2017.[119] The speed limit is 50 km/h within towns, 90 km/h outside of towns and 130 km/h on motorways.[120] The Czech Republic has the densest rail network in the world[121] with 9,505 km (5,906.13 mi) of tracks.[122] Of that number, 2,926 km (1,818.13 mi) is electrified, 7,617 km (4,732.98 mi) are single-line tracks and 1,866 km (1,159.48 mi) are double and multiple-line tracks.[123] České dráhy (the Czech Railways) is the main railway operator in the Czech Republic, with about 180 million passengers carried yearly. Maximum speed is limited to 160 km/h. In 2006 seven Italian tilting trainsets Pendolino ČD Class 680 entered service. Václav Havel Airport in Prague is the main international airport in the country. In 2017, it handled 15 million passengers. In total, the Czech Republic has 46 airports with paved runways, six of which provide international air services in Brno, Karlovy Vary, Mošnov (near Ostrava), Pardubice, Prague and Kunovice (near Uherské Hradiště). Russia, via pipelines through Ukraine and to a lesser extent, Norway, via pipelines through Germany, supply the Czech Republic with liquid and natural gas.[124] Communications and IT Main article: Internet in the Czech Republic The Czech Republic ranks in the top 10 countries worldwide with the fastest average internet speed.[125] By the beginning of 2008, there were over 800 mostly local WISPs,[126][127] with about 350,000 subscribers in 2007. Plans based on either GPRS, EDGE, UMTS or CDMA2000 are being offered by all three mobile phone operators (T-Mobile, O2, Vodafone) and internet provider U:fon. Government-owned Český Telecom slowed down broadband penetration. At the beginning of 2004, local-loop unbundling began and alternative operators started to offer ADSL and also SDSL. This and later privatisation of Český Telecom helped drive down prices. On 1 July 2006, Český Telecom was acquired by globalized company (Spain-owned) Telefónica group and adopted the new name Telefónica O2 Czech Republic. As of 2017[update], VDSL and ADSL2+ are offered in variants, with download speeds of up to 50 Mbit/s and upload speeds of up to 5 Mbit/s. Cable internet is gaining more popularity with its higher download speeds ranging from 50 Mbit/s to 1 Gbit/s. Two computer security companies, Avast and AVG, were founded in the Czech Republic. In 2016, Avast led by Pavel Baudiš bought rival AVG for US$1.3 billion, together at the time, these companies had a user base of about 400 million people and 40% of the consumer market outside of China.[128][129] Avast is the leading provider of antivirus software, with a 20.5% market share.[130] Tourism Main article: Tourism in the Czech Republic Medieval castle Karlštejn. Prague is the fifth most visited city in Europe after London, Paris, Istanbul and Rome.[131] In 2001, the total earnings from tourism reached 118 billion CZK, making up 5.5% of GNP and 9% of overall export earnings. The industry employs more than 110,000 people – over 1% of the population.[132] Guidebooks and tourists reporting overcharging by taxi drivers and pickpocketing problems are mainly in Prague, though the situation has improved recently.[133][134] Since 2005, Prague's mayor, Pavel Bém, has worked to improve this reputation by cracking down on petty crime[134] and, aside from these problems, Prague is a ""safe"" city.[135] The Czech Republic's crime rate is described as ""low"".[136] One of the tourist attractions in the Czech Republic[137] is the Nether district Vítkovice in Ostrava. The Czech Republic boasts 14 UNESCO World Heritage Sites. All of them are in the cultural category. As of 2018[update], further 18 sites are on the tentative list.[138] Architectural heritage is an object of interest to visitors – it includes castles and châteaux from different historical epoques, namely Karlštejn Castle, Český Krumlov and the Lednice–Valtice area. There are 12 cathedrals and 15 churches elevated to the rank of basilica by the Pope, calm monasteries. Away from the towns, areas such as Český ráj, Šumava and the Krkonoše mountains attract visitors seeking outdoor pursuits. There is a number of beer festivals. The country is also known for its various museums. Puppetry and marionette exhibitions are with a number of puppet festivals throughout the country.[139] Aquapalace Praha in Čestlice near Prague, is the biggest water park in central Europe.[140] Science The Czech lands have a long and well-documented history of scientific innovation.[141][142] Today, the Czech Republic has a highly sophisticated, developed, high-performing, innovation-oriented scientific community supported by the government,[143] industry,[144] and leading Czech Universities.[145] Czech scientists are embedded members of the global scientific community.[146] They contribute annually to multiple international academic journals and collaborate with their colleagues across boundaries and fields.[147][148][149][150] Historically, the Czech lands, especially Prague, have been the seat of scientific discovery going back to early modern times. The names such as Tycho Brahe, Nicolaus Copernicus, and Johannes Kepler are only some of the names associated with Prague and the Czech lands. In 1784 the scientific community was first formally organized under the charter of the Royal Czech Society of Sciences. Currently, this organization is known as the Czech Academy of Sciences.[151] Similarly, the Czech lands have a well-established history of scientists,[152][153] including Nobel laureates biochemists Gerty and Carl Ferdinand Cori, chemist Jaroslav Heyrovský and physicist Peter Grünberg.[154] Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, was born in Příbor,[155] Gregor Mendel, the founder of genetics, was born in Hynčice and has spent most of his life in Brno.[156] Most of the learned facsimile, however, have been recorded in Latin or in German and archived in libraries supported and managed by religious groups and other denominations as evidenced by historical locations of international renown and heritage such as the Strahov Monastery and the Clementinum in Prague. Increasingly, Czech scientists publish their work and that of their history in English.[157][158] Demographics Main article: Demographics of the Czech Republic The total fertility rate (TFR) in 2020 was estimated at 1.71 children born/woman, which is below the replacement rate of 2.1.[159] The Czech Republic's population subsequently has an average age of 42.5 years.[160] The life expectancy in 2013 was estimated at 77.56 years (74.29 years male, 81.01 years female).[161] Immigration increased the population by almost 1% in 2007. About 77,000 people immigrate to the Czech Republic annually.[162] Vietnamese immigrants began settling in the country during the Communist period, when they were invited as guest workers by the Czechoslovak government.[163] In 2009, there were about 70,000 Vietnamese in the Czech Republic.[164] Most decide to stay in the country permanently.[165] According to results of the 2011 census, the majority of the inhabitants of the Czech Republic are Czechs (64.3%), followed by Moravians (5.0%), Slovaks (1.4%), Ukrainians (0.5%), Poles (0.4%), Viets (0.3%), Germans (0.2%) and Silesians (0.1%). As the 'nationality' was an optional item, a number of people left this field blank (25.3%).[4] According to some estimates, there are about 250,000 Romani people in the Czech Republic.[166][167] The Polish minority resides mainly in the Zaolzie region.[168] There were 496,413 (4.5% of population) foreigners residing in the country in 2016, according to the Czech Statistical Office, with the largest groups being Ukrainian (22%), Slovak (22%), Vietnamese (12%), Russian (7%) and German (4%). Most of the foreign population lives in Prague (37.3%) and Central Bohemia Region (13.2%).[169] The Jewish population of Bohemia and Moravia, 118,000 according to the 1930 census, was nearly annihilated by the Nazi Germans during the Holocaust.[170] There were approximately 4,000 Jews in the Czech Republic in 2005.[171] The former Czech prime minister, Jan Fischer, is of Jewish faith.[172] Religion Main articles: Religion in the Czech Republic and Religion in the European Union Religion in the Czech Republic (2011)[173] Undeclared 44.7% Irreligion 34.5% Catholicism 10.5% Believers, not members of other religions 6.8% Other Christian churches 1.1% Protestantism 1% Believers, members of other religions 0.7% Other religions / Unknown 0.7% The Czech Republic has 75%[174] to 79%[175] of people not declaring any religion or faith in polls and the percentage of convinced atheists being third highest (30%) behind China (47%) and Japan (31%).[176] The Czech people have been historically characterized as ""tolerant and even indifferent towards religion"".[177] Christianization in the 9th and 10th centuries introduced Catholicism. After the Bohemian Reformation, most Czechs became followers of Jan Hus, Petr Chelčický and other regional Protestant Reformers. Taborites and Utraquists were Hussite groups. During the Hussite Wars, Utraquists sided with the Catholic Church. Following the joint Utraquist—Catholic victory, Utraquism was accepted as a distinct form of Christianity to be practiced in Bohemia by the Catholic Church while all remaining Hussite groups were prohibited. After the Reformation, some Bohemians went with the teachings of Martin Luther, especially Sudeten Germans. In the wake of the Reformation, Utraquist Hussites took a renewed increasingly anti-Catholic stance, while some of the defeated Hussite factions were revived. After the Habsburgs regained control of Bohemia, the whole population was forcibly converted to Catholicism—even the Utraquist Hussites. Going forward, Czechs have become more wary and pessimistic of religion as such. A history of resistance to the Catholic Church followed. It suffered a schism with the neo-Hussite Czechoslovak Hussite Church in 1920, lost the bulk of its adherents during the Communist era and continues to lose in the modern, ongoing secularization. Protestantism never recovered after the Counter-Reformation was introduced by the Austrian Habsburgs in 1620. According to the 2011 census, 34% of the population stated they had no religion, 10.3% was Catholic, 0.8% was Protestant (0.5% Czech Brethren and 0.4% Hussite),[178] and 9% followed other forms of religion both denominational or not (of which 863 people answered they are Pagan). 45% of the population did not answer the question about religion.[173] From 1991 to 2001 and further to 2011 the adherence to Catholicism decreased from 39% to 27% and then to 10%; Protestantism similarly declined from 3.7% to 2% and then to 0.8%.[179] The Muslim population is estimated to be 20,000 representing 0.2% of the population.[180] Welfare Main articles: Education in the Czech Republic and Healthcare in the Czech Republic Orbis Pictus, a children's textbook with illustrations[181] published in 1658. Education in the Czech Republic is compulsory for 9 years and citizens have access to a tuition-free university education, while the average number of years of education is 13.1.[182] Additionally, the Czech Republic has a ""relatively equal"" educational system in comparison with other countries in Europe.[182] Founded in 1348, Charles University was the first university in Central Europe. Other major universities in the country are Masaryk University, Czech Technical University, Palacký University, Academy of Performing Arts and University of Economics. The Programme for International Student Assessment, coordinated by the OECD, currently ranks the Czech education system as the 15th most successful in the world, higher than the OECD average.[183] The UN Education Index ranks the Czech Republic 10th as of 2013[update] (positioned behind Denmark and ahead of South Korea).[184] Healthcare in the Czech Republic is similar in quality to other developed nations. The Czech universal health care system is based on a compulsory insurance model, with fee-for-service care funded by mandatory employment-related insurance plans.[185] According to the 2016 Euro health consumer index, a comparison of healthcare in Europe, the Czech healthcare is 13th, ranked behind Sweden and two positions ahead of the United Kingdom.[186] Culture Main article: Culture of the Czech Republic Art Main article: Czech art Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter (1896) by Art Nouveau artist Alphonse Mucha Venus of Dolní Věstonice is the treasure of prehistoric art. Theodoric of Prague was a painter in the Gothic era who decorated the castle Karlstejn. In the Baroque era, there were Wenceslaus Hollar, Jan Kupecký, Karel Škréta, Anton Raphael Mengs or Petr Brandl, sculptors Matthias Braun and Ferdinand Brokoff. In the first half of the 19th century, Josef Mánes joined the romantic movement. In the second half of the 19th century had the main say the so-called ""National Theatre generation"": sculptor Josef Václav Myslbek and painters Mikoláš Aleš, Václav Brožík, Vojtěch Hynais or Julius Mařák. At the end of the century came a wave of Art Nouveau. Alfons Mucha became the main representative. He is known for Art Nouveau posters and his cycle of 20 large canvases named the Slav Epic, which depicts the history of Czechs and other Slavs. As of 2012[update], the Slav Epic can be seen in the Veletržní Palace of the National Gallery in Prague, which manages the largest collection of art in the Czech Republic. Max Švabinský was another Art nouveau painter. The 20th century brought an avant-garde revolution. In the Czech lands mainly expressionist and cubist: Josef Čapek, Emil Filla, Bohumil Kubišta, Jan Zrzavý. Surrealism emerged particularly in the work of Toyen, Josef Šíma and Karel Teige. In the world, however, he pushed mainly František Kupka, a pioneer of abstract painting. As illustrators and cartoonists in the first half of the 20th century gained fame Josef Lada, Zdeněk Burian or Emil Orlík. Art photography has become a new field (František Drtikol, Josef Sudek, later Jan Saudek or Josef Koudelka). The Czech Republic is known for its individually made, mouth-blown, and decorated Bohemian glass. Architecture Main article: Czech architecture Historic center of Prague The earliest preserved stone buildings in Bohemia and Moravia date back to the time of the Christianization in the 9th and 10th centuries. Since the Middle Ages, the Czech lands have been using the same architectural styles as most of Western and Central Europe. The oldest still standing churches were built in the Romanesque style. During the 13th century, it was replaced by the Gothic style. In the 14th century, Emperor Charles IV invited architects from France and Germany, Matthias of Arras and Peter Parler, to his court in Prague. During the Middle Ages, some fortified castles were built by the king and aristocracy, as well as some monasteries. The Renaissance style penetrated the Bohemian Crown in the late 15th century when the older Gothic style started to be mixed with Renaissance elements. An example of pure Renaissance architecture in Bohemia is the Queen Anne's Summer Palace, which was situated in the garden of Prague Castle. Evidence of the general reception of the Renaissance in Bohemia, involving an influx of Italian architects, can be found in spacious chateaus with arcade courtyards and geometrically arranged gardens.[187] Emphasis was placed on comfort, and buildings that were built for entertainment purposes also appeared.[188] In the 17th century, the Baroque style spread throughout the Crown of Bohemia.[189] In the 18th century, Bohemia produced an architectural peculiarity – the Baroque Gothic style, a synthesis of the Gothic and Baroque styles.[187] Czech artists developed a distinct cubist style in architecture and applied arts. It later evolved into national Czechoslovak style, rondocubism. During the 19th century stands the revival architectural styles. Some churches were restored to their presumed medieval appearance and there were constructed buildings in the Neo-Romanesque, Neo-Gothic and Neo-Renaissance styles. At the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, the new art style appeared in the Czech lands – Art Nouveau. Bohemia contributed an unusual style to the world's architectural heritage when Czech architects attempted to transpose the Cubism of painting and sculpture into architecture. Between World Wars I and II, Functionalism, with its sober, progressive forms, took over as the main architectural style.[187] After World War II and the Communist coup in 1948, art in Czechoslovakia became Soviet-influenced. The Czechoslovak avant-garde artistic movement is known as the Brussels style came up in the time of political liberalization of Czechoslovakia in the 1960s. Brutalism dominated in the 1970s and 1980s. The Czech Republic is not shying away from the more modern trends of international architecture.[187] Literature Main article: Czech literatureThe literature from the area of today's Czech Republic was mostly written in Czech, but also in Latin and German or even Old Church Slavonic. Franz Kafka, who—while bilingual in Czech and German[190][191]—wrote his works (The Trial, The Castle) in German. Franz Kafka In the second half of the 13th century, the royal court in Prague became one of the centers of German Minnesang and courtly literature. The Czech German-language literature can be seen in the first half of the 20th century. Bible translations played a role in the development of Czech literature. The oldest Czech translation of the Psalms originated in the late 13th century and the first complete Czech translation of the Bible was finished around 1360. The first complete printed Czech Bible was published in 1488. The first complete Czech Bible translation from the original languages was published between 1579 and 1593. The Codex Gigas from the 12th century is the largest extant medieval manuscript in the world.[192] Czech-language literature can be divided into several periods: the Middle Ages; the Hussite period; the Renaissance humanism; the Baroque period; the Enlightenment and Czech reawakening in the first half of the 19th century, modern literature in the second half of the 19th century; the avant-garde of the interwar period; the years under Communism; and the Czech Republic. The antiwar comedy novel The Good Soldier Švejk is the most translated Czech book in history. The international literary award the Franz Kafka Prize is awarded in the Czech Republic.[193] The Czech Republic has the densest network of libraries in Europe.[194] Czech literature and culture played a role on at least two occasions when Czechs lived under oppression and political activity was suppressed. On both of these occasions, in the early 19th century and then again in the 1960s, the Czechs used their cultural and literary effort to strive for political freedom, establishing a confident, politically aware nation.[195] Music Main articles: Music of the Czech Lands and Moravian traditional music Bedřich Smetana on the painting of František Dvořák The musical tradition of the Czech lands arose from the first church hymns, whose first evidence is suggested at the break of the 10th and 11th centuries. Some pieces of Czech music include two chorales, which in their time performed the function of anthems: ""Lord, Have Mercy on Us"" and the hymn ""Saint Wenceslas"" or ""Saint Wenceslas Chorale"".[196] The authorship of the anthem ""Lord, Have Mercy on Us"" is ascribed by some historians to Saint Adalbert of Prague (sv.Vojtěch), bishop of Prague, living between 956 and 997.[197] The wealth of musical culture lies in the classical music tradition during all historical periods, especially in the Baroque, Classicism, Romantic, modern classical music and in the traditional folk music of Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia. Since the early era of artificial music, Czech musicians and composers have been influenced the folk music of the region and dance. Czech music can be considered to have been ""beneficial"" in both the European and worldwide context, several times co-determined or even determined a newly arriving era in musical art,[198] above all of Classical era, as well as by original attitudes in Baroque, Romantic and modern classical music. Some Czech musical works are The Bartered Bride, New World Symphony, Sinfonietta and Jenůfa. A music festival in the country is Prague Spring International Music Festival of classical music, a permanent showcase for performing artists, symphony orchestras and chamber music ensembles of the world. Theatre The National Theatre (left) and the Estates Theatre (right)Main article: Theatre of the Czech Republic The roots of Czech theatre can be found in the Middle Ages, especially in the cultural life of gothic period. In the 19th century, the theatre played a role in the national awakening movement and later, in the 20th century, it became a part of modern European theatre art. The original Czech cultural phenomenon came into being at the end of the 1950s. This project called Laterna magika, resulting in productions that combined theater, dance, and film in a poetic manner, considered the first multimedia art project in an international context. A drama is Karel Čapek's play R.U.R., which introduced the word ""robot"".[199] Film Main article: Cinema of the Czech Republic American poster of Karel Zeman's 1958 film A Deadly Invention The tradition of Czech cinematography started in the second half of the 1890s. Peaks of the production in the era of silent movies include the historical drama The Builder of the Temple and the social and erotic drama Erotikon directed by Gustav Machatý.[200] The early Czech sound film era was productive, above all in mainstream genres, with the comedies of Martin Frič or Karel Lamač. There were dramatic movies sought internationally. After the period of Nazi occupation and early communist official dramaturgy of socialist realism in movies at the turn of the 1940s and 1950s with a fewer exceptions such as Krakatit or Men without wings (awarded by Palme d'Or in 1946), an era of the Czech film began with animated films, performed in anglophone countries under the name ""The Fabulous World of Jules Verne"" from 1958, which combined acted drama with animation, and Jiří Trnka, the founder of the modern puppet film.[201] This began a tradition of animated films (Mole etc.). In the 1960s, the hallmark of Czechoslovak New Wave's films were improvised dialogues, black and absurd humor and the occupation of non-actors. Directors are trying to preserve natural atmosphere without refinement and artificial arrangement of scenes. A personality of the 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s with original manuscript and psychological impact is František Vláčil. Another international author is Jan Švankmajer, a filmmaker and artist whose work spans several media. He is a self-labeled surrealist known for animations and features.[202] The Barrandov Studios in Prague are the largest film studios with film locations in the country.[203] Filmmakers have come to Prague to shoot scenery no longer found in Berlin, Paris and Vienna.

Czech beer with the first brewery is known to have existed in 993 and the Czech Republic has the highest beer consumption per capita in the world. The ""pilsner style beer"" (pils) originated in Plzeň, where the world's first-ever blond lager Pilsner Urquell is still being produced, making it the inspiration for more than two-thirds of the beer produced in the world today. Further south the town of České Budějovice, lent its name to its beer, known as Budweiser Budvar. Tourism around the Southern Moravian region has been producing wine since the Middle Ages; about 94% of vineyards in the Czech Republic are Moravian. Aside from slivovitz, Czech beer and wine, the Czechs also produce two liquors, Fernet Stock and Becherovka.

Perspectives is internationally recognized for its outstanding contribution to establishing and advancing the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), including the successful design of UNFCCC-approved baseline and monitoring methodologies and the management of complex Programmes of Activities (PoAs). In addition, Perspectives has been leading the development of pioneering approaches for Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs) and Low Emission Development Strategies (LEDS) in many countries and sectors around the world – both on the conceptual as well as on the practical level. We strive for environmental integrity and effectiveness of climate policy interventions. Building on experiences accumulated over decades, Perspectives’ team is applying its technical and political expertise to support governments in the update and implementation of their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) under the Paris Agreement. Our deep knowledge of numerous economic sectors at various stages of development and their potential mitigation contributions as well as our analytical work on national mitigation targets lends itself perfectly to develop the mitigation strategies underpinning NDCs. We support the development of Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) procedures for mitigation and adaptation, including assessment of sustainable development co-benefits. We strive for environmental integrity and effectiveness of any climate policy, climate finance and adaptation, and are contributing to the evolution of the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and other international climate finance providers through policy advice and funding proposal development. Throughout the eventful history of international climate policy, Perspectives has provided first-rate advice on the latest policy innovations – and we are at your disposal for designing the innovations of the future.Country: Germanyhttps://www.perspectives.cc/company/ × Error ###messages### ServiceSubscribe to our newsletterOur newsletter informs you about interesting information on all topics concerning the green cooling initiative.Subscribe today for news, events and the most recent publications.SubscribeService navigation 1MethodologyGlossaryCool TrainingContactService navigation 2Pri­va­cy po­li­cyLegal noticeCookie declarationFederal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety of the Federal Republic of Germany (opens in a new window)Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development of the Federal Republic of Germany (opens in a new window) Cookie NoticeWe use cookies to make it easier for you to use our website and to analyse our traffic.

The Commonwealth is bordered by Delaware to the southeast, Maryland to the south, West Virginia to the southwest, Ohio to the west, Lake Erie and the Canadian province of Ontario to the northwest, New York to the north, and New Jersey to the east, while the Appalachian Mountains run through its middle. Pennsylvania is the 33rd-largest state by area, and the 5th-most populous state with a total population of 13,011,844[5] according to the most recent official U.S. Census count in 2020. It is the 9th-most densely populated of the 50 states. Pennsylvania's two most populous cities are Philadelphia (1,580,863), and Pittsburgh (302,407). The state capital and its 13th-largest city is Harrisburg. Pennsylvania has 140 miles (225 km) of waterfront along Lake Erie and the Delaware River.[8] The state is one of the Thirteen original founding states of the United States; it came into being in 1681 as a result of a royal land grant to William Penn, the son of the state's namesake. Part of Pennsylvania (along the Delaware River), together with the present State of Delaware, had earlier been organized as the Colony of New Sweden. It was the second state to ratify the United States Constitution, on December 12, 1787. Independence Hall, where the United States Declaration of Independence and United States Constitution were drafted, is located in Philadelphia, the state's largest city. During the American Civil War, the Battle of Gettysburg was fought in the south central region of the state. Valley Forge near Philadelphia was General Washington's headquarters during the bitter winter of 1777–78.

New Sweden claimed and, for the most part, controlled the lower Delaware River region (parts of present-day Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania) but settled few colonists there.[21][22] On March 12, 1664, King Charles II of England gave James, Duke of York a grant that incorporated all lands included in the original Virginia Company of Plymouth Grant plus other lands. This grant was in conflict with the Dutch claim for New Netherland, which included parts of today's Pennsylvania.[23] On June 24, 1664, the Duke of York sold the portion of his large grant that included present-day New Jersey to John Berkeley and George Carteret for a proprietary colony. The land was not yet in British possession, but the sale boxed in the portion of New Netherland on the West side of the Delaware River. The British conquest of New Netherland began on August 29, 1664, when New Amsterdam was coerced to surrender while facing cannons on British ships in New York Harbor.[24][25] This conquest continued, and was completed in October 1664, when the British captured Fort Casimir in what today is New Castle, Delaware. John Dickinson The Peace of Breda between England, France and the Netherlands confirmed the English conquest on July 21, 1667,[26][27] although there were temporary reversions. On September 12, 1672, during the Third Anglo-Dutch War, the Dutch re-conquered New York Colony/New Amsterdam, establishing three County Courts, which went on to become original Counties in present-day Delaware and Pennsylvania. The one that later transferred to Pennsylvania was Upland.[28] This was partially reversed on February 9, 1674, when the Treaty of Westminster ended the Third Anglo-Dutch War, and reverted all political situations to the status quo ante bellum. The British retained the Dutch Counties with their Dutch names.[29] By June 11, 1674, New York reasserted control over the outlying colonies, including Upland, but the names started to be changed to British names by November 11, 1674.[30] Upland was partitioned on November 12, 1674, producing the general outline of the current border between Pennsylvania and Delaware.[31] On February 28, 1681, Charles II granted a land charter[32] to William Penn to repay a debt of £16,000[33] (around £2,100,000 in 2008, adjusting for retail inflation)[34] owed to William's father, Admiral William Penn. This was one of the largest land grants to an individual in history.[35] The King named it Pennsylvania (literally ""Penn's Woods"") in honor of Admiral Penn; the Admiral's son who proposed that the land be called New Wales and then, after objections, Sylvania (from the Latin silva: ""forest, woods""), was embarrassed at the change from the latter proposed form, fearing that people would think he had named it after himself, but King Charles would not rename the grant.[36] Penn established a government with two innovations that were much copied in the New World: the county commission and freedom of religious conviction.[35] What had been Upland on what became the Pennsylvania side of the Pennsylvania-Delaware Border was renamed as Chester County when Pennsylvania instituted their colonial governments on March 4, 1681.[37][38] The Quaker leader William Penn had signed a peace treaty with Tammany, leader of the Delaware tribe, beginning a long period of friendly relations between the Quakers and the Indians.[39] Additional treaties between Quakers and other tribes followed. The treaty of William Penn was never violated.[40][41][42] 18th century[edit] Main articles: French and Indian War, Treaty of Paris (1763), Indian Reserve (1763), Pennsylvania in the American Revolution, First Continental Congress, American Revolutionary War, Second Continental Congress, Lee Resolution, United States Declaration of Independence, Philadelphia campaign, Articles of Confederation § Ratification, Treaty of Paris (1783), Constitutional Convention (United States), Admission to the Union, and List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union Between 1730 and when it was shut down by Parliament with the Currency Act of 1764, the Pennsylvania Colony made its own paper money to account for the shortage of actual gold and silver. The paper money was called Colonial Scrip. The Colony issued ""bills of credit"", which were as good as gold or silver coins because of their legal tender status. Since they were issued by the government and not a banking institution, it was an interest-free proposition, largely defraying the expense of the government and therefore taxation of the people. It also promoted general employment and prosperity, since the Government used discretion and did not issue too much to inflate the currency. Benjamin Franklin had a hand in creating this currency, of which he said its utility was never to be disputed, and it also met with the ""cautious approval"" of Adam Smith.[43] James Smith wrote that in 1763, ""the Indians again commenced hostilities, and were busily engaged in killing and scalping the frontier inhabitants in various parts of Pennsylvania."" Further, ""This state was then a Quaker government, and at the first of this war the frontiers received no assistance from the state.""[44] The ensuing hostilities became known as Pontiac's War. After the Stamp Act Congress of 1765, Delegate John Dickinson of Philadelphia wrote the Declaration of Rights and Grievances. The Congress was the first meeting of the Thirteen Colonies, called at the request of the Massachusetts Assembly, but only nine colonies sent delegates.[45] Dickinson then wrote Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania, To the Inhabitants of the British Colonies, which were published in the Pennsylvania Chronicle between December 2, 1767, and February 15, 1768.[46] When the Founding Fathers of the United States convened in Philadelphia in 1774, 12 colonies sent representatives to the First Continental Congress.[47] The Second Continental Congress, which also met in Philadelphia (in May 1775), drew up and signed the Declaration of Independence in Philadelphia,[48] but when that city was captured by the British, the Continental Congress escaped westward, meeting at the Lancaster courthouse on Saturday, September 27, 1777, and then to York. There they and its primary author, John Dickinson, drew up the Articles of Confederation that formed 13 independent States[49] into a new union. Later, the Constitution was written, and Philadelphia was once again chosen to be cradle to the new American Union.[50] The Constitution was drafted and signed at the Pennsylvania State House, now known as Independence Hall, and the same building where the Declaration of Independence was signed.[51] Pennsylvania became the first large state, and the second state to ratify the U.S. Constitution on December 12, 1787,[52] five days after Delaware became the first. At the time it was the most ethnically and religiously diverse of the thirteen States. Because one-third of Pennsylvania's population spoke German, the Constitution was presented in German to include those citizens in the discussion. Reverend Frederick Muhlenberg acted as the chairman of the state's ratifying convention.[53] Dickinson College of Carlisle was the first college founded after the States united. Established in 1773, the college was ratified five days after the Treaty of Paris on September 9, 1783. The school was founded by Benjamin Rush and named after John Dickinson. The ""Hills Capitol"", used from 1821 until it burned down in 1897 For half a century, the Commonwealth's General Assembly (legislature) met at various places in the general Philadelphia area before starting to meet regularly in Independence Hall in Philadelphia for 63 years.[54] But it needed a more central location, as for example the Paxton Boys massacres of 1763 had made the legislature aware. So, in 1799 the General Assembly moved to the Lancaster Courthouse,[54] and finally in 1812 to Harrisburg.[54] 19th century[edit] The General Assembly met in the old Dauphin County Court House until December 1821,[54] when the Federal-style ""Hills Capitol"" (named for its builder, Stephen Hills, a Lancaster architect) was constructed on a hilltop land grant of four acres set aside for a seat of state government by the prescient, entrepreneurial son and namesake of John Harris, Sr., a Yorkshire native who had founded a trading post in 1705 and ferry (1733) on the east shore of the Susquehanna River.[55] The Hills Capitol burned down on February 2, 1897, during a heavy snowstorm, presumably because of a faulty flue.[54] The General Assembly met at Grace Methodist Church on State Street (still standing) until a new capitol could be built. Following an architectural selection contest that many alleged had been ""rigged"", Chicago architect Henry Ives Cobb was charged with designing and building a replacement building; however, the legislature had little money to allocate to the project, and a roughly finished, somewhat industrial building (the Cobb Capitol) was completed. The General Assembly refused to occupy the building. Political and popular indignation in 1901 prompted a second contest that was restricted to Pennsylvania architects, and Joseph Miller Huston of Philadelphia was chosen to design the present Pennsylvania State Capitol that incorporated Cobb's building into magnificent public work finished and dedicated in 1907.[54] The new state Capitol drew rave reviews.[54] Its dome was inspired by the domes of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome and the United States Capitol.[54] President Theodore Roosevelt called it ""the most beautiful state Capital in the nation"" and said, ""It's the handsomest building I ever saw"" at the dedication. In 1989, The New York Times praised it as ""grand, even awesome at moments, but it is also a working building, accessible to citizens ... a building that connects with the reality of daily life"".[54] James Buchanan, of Franklin County, the only bachelor president of the United States (1857–1861),[56] was the only one to be born in Pennsylvania. The Battle of Gettysburg—the major turning point of the Civil War—took place near Gettysburg.[57] An estimated 350,000 Pennsylvanians served in the Union Army forces including 8,600 African American military volunteers. Pennsylvania was also the home of the first commercially drilled oil well. In 1859, near Titusville, Pennsylvania, Edwin Drake successfully drilled the well, which led to the first major oil boom in United States history. 20th century[edit] This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (June 2016) Franklin D. Roosevelt's FERA camp for unemployed women, 1934 At the beginning of the 20th century, Pennsylvania's economy centered on steel production, logging, coal mining, textile production and other forms of industrial manufacturing. A surge in immigration to the U.S. during the late 19th and early 20th centuries provided a steady flow of cheap labor for these industries, which often employed children and people who could not speak English. In 1923, President Calvin Coolidge established the Allegheny National Forest under the authority of the Weeks Act of 1911.[58] The forest is located in the northwest part of the state in Elk, Forest, McKean, and Warren Counties for the purposes of timber production and watershed protection in the Allegheny River basin. The Allegheny is the state's only national forest.[59] The Three Mile Island accident was the most significant nuclear accident in U.S. commercial nuclear power plant history.[60][61] 21st century[edit] United Airlines Flight 93 crashed into a field near Shanksville during the September 11th attacks, killing 44. Within the first half of 2003, the annual Tekko commences in Pittsburgh.[62] In October 2018, the Tree of Life – Or L'Simcha Congregation experienced the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting.[63] Geography[edit] Further information: Geography of Pennsylvania and List of counties in Pennsylvania Worlds End State Park, Sullivan County Pennsylvania is 170 miles (274 km) north to south and 283 miles (455 km) east to west.[64] Of a total 46,055 square miles (119,282 km2), 44,817 square miles (116,075 km2) are land, 490 square miles (1,269 km2) are inland waters, and 749 square miles (1,940 km2) are waters in Lake Erie.[65] It is the 33rd-largest state in the United States.[66] Pennsylvania has 51 miles (82 km)[67] of coastline along Lake Erie and 57 miles (92 km)[8] of shoreline along the Delaware Estuary. Of the original Thirteen Colonies, Pennsylvania is the only state that does not border the Atlantic Ocean. The boundaries of the state are the Mason–Dixon line (39°43' N) to the south, the Twelve-Mile Circle on the Pennsylvania-Delaware border, the Delaware River to the east, 80°31' W to the west and the 42° N to the north, except for a short segment on the western end, where a triangle extends north to Lake Erie. Cities include Philadelphia, Reading, Lebanon and Lancaster in the southeast, Pittsburgh in the southwest, and the tri-cities of Allentown, Bethlehem, and Easton in the central east (known as the Lehigh Valley). The northeast includes the former anthracite coal mining cities of Scranton, Wilkes-Barre, Pittston, Nanticoke, and Hazleton. Erie is located in the northwest. State College serves the central region while Williamsport serves the commonwealth's north-central region as does Chambersburg in the south-central region, with York, Carlisle, and the state capital Harrisburg on the Susquehanna River in the east-central region of the Commonwealth and Altoona and Johnstown in the west-central region. The state has five geographical regions, namely the Allegheny Plateau, Ridge and Valley, Atlantic Coastal Plain, Piedmont, and the Erie Plain. Adjacent states and province[edit] Ontario (Province of Canada) (Northwest) New York (North and Northeast) New Jersey (East and Southeast) Delaware (Extreme Southeast) Maryland (South) West Virginia (Southwest) Ohio (West) Climate[edit] Main article: Climate of Pennsylvania Köppen climate types of Pennsylvania Autumn in North Branch Township, Wyoming County, Pennsylvania Pennsylvania's diverse topography also produces a variety of climates, though the entire state experiences cold winters and humid summers. Straddling two major zones, the majority of the state, except for the southeastern corner, has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfa). The southern portion of the state has a humid subtropical climate. The largest city, Philadelphia, has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cfa) though with noticeably colder, snowier winters than most locations featuring this climate. Summers are generally hot and humid. Moving toward the mountainous interior of the state, the winter climate becomes colder, the number of cloudy days increases, and snowfall amounts are greater. Western areas of the state, particularly locations near Lake Erie, can receive over 100 inches (250 cm) of snowfall annually, and the entire state receives plentiful precipitation throughout the year. The state may be subject to severe weather from spring through summer into autumn. Tornadoes occur annually in the state, sometimes in large numbers, such as 30 recorded tornadoes in 2011; generally speaking, these tornadoes do not cause significant damage.[68] Monthly Average High and Low Temperatures For Various Pennsylvania Cities (in °F) City Jan.

The most populous county in Pennsylvania is Philadelphia, while the least populous is Cameron (5,085).[76] There are a total of 56 cities in Pennsylvania, which are classified, by population, as either first-, second-, or third-class cities.[74][77] Philadelphia, Pennsylvania's largest city, has a population of 1,526,006 and is the state's only first-class city.[75] Pittsburgh (305,704) and Scranton (76,089) are second-class and second-class 'A' cities, respectively.[75] The rest of the cities, like the third and fourth-largest—Allentown (120,443) and Erie (98,593)—to the smallest—Parker with a population of only 820—are third-class cities.[78] First- and second-class cities are governed by a ""strong mayor"" form of mayor–council government, whereas third-class cities are governed by either a ""weak mayor"" form of government or a council–manager government.[75] Boroughs are generally smaller than cities, with most Pennsylvania cities having been incorporated as a borough before being incorporated as a city.[75] There are 958  boroughs in Pennsylvania, all of which are governed by the ""weak mayor"" form of mayor-council government.[74][75] The largest borough in Pennsylvania is State College (41,992) and the smallest is Centralia. Townships are the third type of municipality in Pennsylvania and are classified as either first-class or second-class townships. There are 1,454 second-class townships and 93 first-class townships.[79] Second-class townships can become first-class townships if they have a population density greater than 300 inhabitants per square mile (120/km2) and a referendum is passed supporting the change.[79] Pennsylvania's largest township is Upper Darby Township (82,629), and the smallest is East Keating Township. There is one exception to the types of municipalities in Pennsylvania: Bloomsburg was incorporated as a town in 1870 and is, officially, the only town in the state.[80] In 1975, McCandless Township adopted a home-rule charter under the name of ""Town of McCandless"", but is, legally, still a first-class township.[81] The total of 56 cities, 958 boroughs, 93 first-class townships, 1,454 second-class townships, and one town (Bloomsburg) is 2,562 municipalities.

Net migration to other states resulted in a decrease of 27,718, and immigration from other countries resulted in an increase of 127,007. Net migration to the Commonwealth was 98,289. Migration of native Pennsylvanians resulted in a decrease of 100,000 people. From 2008 to 2012, 5.8% of the population was foreign-born.[84] Place of origin[edit] John Morton (1725–1777), a Pennsylvanian jurist and one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, had Finnish roots;[85] Morton, which was an anglicized version of the family's original Finnish name Marttinen, came to America from Rautalampi municipality of North Savonia, Finland.[86][87][88] Of the people residing in Pennsylvania, 74.5% were born in Pennsylvania, 18.4% were born in a different U.S. state, 1.5% were born in Puerto Rico, U.S. Island areas, or born abroad to American parent(s), and 5.6% were foreign born.[89] Foreign-born Pennsylvanians are largely from Asia (36.0%), Europe (35.9%), and Latin America (30.6%), with the remainder from Africa (5%), North America (3.1%), and Oceania (0.4%). The largest ancestry groups are listed below, expressed as a percentage of total people who responded with a particular ancestry for the 2010 census:[90][91] German 28.5% Irish 18.2% Italian 12.8% African American 9.6% English 8.5% Polish 7.2% French 4.2% Racial breakdown[edit] Pennsylvania Racial Breakdown of Population Racial composition 1990[92] 2000[93] 2010[94] White 88.5% 85.4% 81.9% Black 9.2% 10.0% 10.9% Asian 1.2% 1.8% 2.8% Native 0.1% 0.1% 0.2% Native Hawaiian andother Pacific Islander – – – Other race 1.0% 1.5% 2.4% Two or more races – 1.2% 1.9% As of 2011, 32.1% of Pennsylvania's population younger than age 1 were minorities.[95] Pennsylvania's Hispanic population grew by 82.6% between 2000 and 2010, making it one of the largest increases in a state's Hispanic population. The significant growth of the Hispanic population is due to immigration to the state mainly from Puerto Rico, which is a US territory, but to a lesser extent from countries such as the Dominican Republic, Mexico, and various Central and South American nations, as well as from the wave of Hispanics leaving New York and New Jersey for safer and more affordable living. The Asian population swelled by almost 60%, which was fueled by Indian, Vietnamese, and Chinese immigration, as well the many Asian transplants moving to Philadelphia from New York. The rapid growth of this community has given Pennsylvania one of the largest Asian populations in the nation by numerical values. The Black and African American population grew by 13%, which was the largest increase in that population amongst the state's peers (New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Illinois, and Michigan). Twelve other states saw decreases in their White populations.[96] The state has a high in-migration of black and Hispanic people from other nearby states, with eastern and south-central portions of the state seeing the bulk of the increases.[76][97] The majority of Hispanics in Pennsylvania are of Puerto Rican descent, having one of the largest and fastest-growing Puerto Rican populations in the country.[98][99] Most of the remaining Hispanic population is made up of Mexicans and Dominicans. Most Hispanics are concentrated in Philadelphia, Lehigh Valley and South Central Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania's reported population of Hispanics, especially among the Black race, has markedly increased in recent years.[100] The Hispanic population is greatest in Bethlehem, Allentown, Reading, Lancaster, York, and around Philadelphia. It is not clear how much of this change reflects a changing population and how much reflects increased willingness to self-identify minority status. As of 2010, it is estimated that about 85% of all Hispanics in Pennsylvania live within a 150-mile (240 km) radius of Philadelphia, with about 20% living within the city itself. Of the black population, the vast majority in the state are African American, being descendants of African slaves brought to the US south during the colonial era. There are also a growing number of blacks of West Indian, recent African, and Hispanic origins.[101] Most blacks live in the Philadelphia area, Pittsburgh, and South Central Pennsylvania. Whites make up the majority of Pennsylvania; they are mostly descended from German, Irish, Scottish, Welsh, Italian, and English immigrants. Rural portions of South Central Pennsylvania are famous nationwide for their notable Amish communities. The Wyoming Valley, consisting of Scranton and Wilkes-Barre, has the highest percentage of white residents of any metropolitan area (with a population of 500,000 or above) in the U.S., with 96.2% of its population claiming to be white with no Hispanic background. The center of population of Pennsylvania is located in Perry County, in the borough of Duncannon.[102] State population from 1790 to 2000 Pennsylvania's population distribution Age and poverty[edit] The state had the fourth-highest proportion of elderly (65+) citizens in 2010—15.4%, as compared to 13.0% nationwide.[103] According to U.S. Census Bureau estimates, the state's poverty rate was 12.5% in 2017, compared to 13.4% for the United States as a whole.[104] Population Aged 65 and Older: Top 10 States[103] State % of population Florida 17.3 West Virginia 16.0 Maine 15.9 Pennsylvania 15.4 Iowa 14.9 Montana 14.8 Vermont 14.6 North Dakota 14.5 Rhode Island 14.4 Arkansas 14.4 Birth data[edit] Note: Births in table do not add up because Hispanics are counted both by their ethnicity and by their race, giving a higher overall number.

Languages[edit] Top 10 Non-English Languages Spoken in Pennsylvania Language Percentage of population(as of 2010)[112] Spanish 4.1% German (including Pennsylvania German) 0.9% Chinese (including Mandarin) 0.5% Italian 0.4% French 0.3% Russian 0.3% Vietnamese 0.3% Korean 0.3% Polish 0.2% Arabic 0.2% Hindi 0.2% As of 2010, 90.2% (10,710,239) of Pennsylvania residents age 5 and older spoke English at home as a primary language, while 4.1% (486,058) spoke Spanish, 0.8% (103,502) German (which includes Pennsylvania Dutch) and 0.5% (56,052) Chinese (which includes Mandarin) of the population over the age of five. In total, 9.9% (1,170,628) of Pennsylvania's population age 5 and older spoke a mother language other than English.[112] Pennsylvania German language[edit] Main article: Pennsylvania German language Pennsylvania German is often—even though misleadingly—called ""Pennsylvania Dutch"". The term Dutch used to mean ""German""[113] (including the Netherlands), before the Latin name for them replaced it (but stuck with the Netherlands). When referring to the language spoken by the Pennsylvania Dutch people (Pennsylvania German) it means ""German"" or ""Teutonic"" rather than ""Netherlander"". Germans, in their own language, call themselves ""Deutsch"", (Pennsylvania German: ""Deitsch""). The Pennsylvania German language is a descendant of German, in the West Central German dialect family. It is closest to Palatine German. Pennsylvania German is still very vigorous as a first language among Old Order Amish and Old Order Mennonites (principally in the Lancaster County area), whereas it is almost extinct as an everyday language outside the plain communities, though a few words have passed into English usage. Religion[edit] Religion in Pennsylvania (2014)[114] religion percent Protestant 47% Catholic 24% Unaffiliated 21% Other faiths/don't know 2% Hindu 1% Jehovah's witnesses 1% Jewish 0.8% Muslim 0.6% An Amish family riding in a traditional Amish buggy Of all the colonies, only Rhode Island had religious freedom as secure as in Pennsylvania.[115] Voltaire, writing of William Penn in 1733, observed: ""The new sovereign also enacted several wise and wholesome laws for his colony, which have remained invariably the same to this day. The chief is, to ill-treat no person on account of religion, and to consider as brethren all those who believe in one God.""[116] One result of this uncommon freedom was a wide religious diversity, which continues to the present. Pennsylvania's population in 2010 was 12,702,379. Of these, 6,838,440 (53.8%) were estimated to belong to some sort of organized religion. According to the Association of religion data archives (ARDA) at Pennsylvania State University, the largest religions in Pennsylvania by adherents are the Roman Catholic Church with 3,503,028 adherents, the United Methodist Church with 591,734 members, and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America with 501,974 members. Pennsylvania, especially in the west and in the Pittsburgh area, has one of the largest communities of Presbyterians in the nation, being the third highest by percentage of population and the largest outright in membership.[117] The Presbyterian Church (USA), with about 250,000 members and 1,011 congregations, is the largest church, while the Presbyterian Church in America is also significant, with 112 congregations and 23,000 adherents; the EPC has around 50 congregations, as well as the ECO. The fourth-largest Protestant denomination, the United Church of Christ, has 180,000 members and 627 congregations. American Baptist Churches USA (Northern Baptist Convention) is based in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania was the center state of the German Reformed denomination from the 1700s.[118] Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, is one of the headquarters of the Moravian Church in America. Pennsylvania also has a very large Amish population, second only to Ohio among the states.[119] In the year 2000 there was a total Amish population of 47,860 in Pennsylvania and a further 146,416 Mennonites and 91,200 Brethren. The total Anabapist population including Bruderhof[120] was 232,631, about two percent of the population.[121] While Pennsylvania owes its existence to Quakers, and much of the historic character of the Commonwealth is ideologically rooted in the teachings of the Religious Society of Friends (as they are officially known), practicing Quakers are a small minority of about 10,000 adherents in 2010.[122] As of 2014[update], the religious affiliations of the people of Pennsylvania are:[114] Christian 73% Protestant 47% Mainline Protestant 23% Evangelical Protestant 19% Black Protestant 5% Roman Catholic 24% Jehovah's Witnesses 1% Orthodox Christian <1% Non-religious/Unaffiliated 21% Judaism 1% Islam 1% Hinduism 1% Other 2% Don't know/Refused to say 1% According to a 2016 Gallup poll, 38% of Pennsylvanians are very religious, 29% are moderately religious, and 34% are non-religious.[123] Economy[edit] It has been suggested that this section be split out into another article titled Economy of Pennsylvania. (Discuss) (September 2020) See also: List of Pennsylvania counties by per capita income Pennsylvania was home of two of the largest steel producers in the world; Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel and Bethlehem-based Bethlehem Steel. The former blast furnace sites have either been destroyed, preserved, or in the case of Bethlehem, became a new multi-million dollar Sands Casino Resort (now Wind Creek Bethlehem) in 2009 Pennsylvania's 2018 total gross state product (GSP) of $803 billion ranks the state 6th in the nation.[124] If Pennsylvania were an independent country, its economy would rank as the 19th-largest in the world.[125] On a per-capita basis, Pennsylvania's 2016 per-capita GSP of $50,665 (in chained 2009 dollars) ranks 22nd among the fifty states.[124] Geo map of average income by location in Pennsylvania. Data shown is from the 2014 American Community Survey five-year estimate. Total employment 2016 5,354,964 Total employer establishments 301,484[126] Philadelphia in the southeast corner, Pittsburgh in the southwest corner, Erie in the northwest corner, Scranton-Wilkes-Barre in the northeast corner, and Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton in the east central region are urban manufacturing centers. Much of the Commonwealth is rural; this dichotomy affects state politics as well as the state economy.[127] Philadelphia is home to six Fortune 500 companies,[128] with more located in suburbs like King of Prussia; it is a leader in the financial[129] and insurance industry. Pittsburgh is home to eight Fortune 500 companies, including U.S. Steel, PPG Industries, and H.J. Heinz.[128] In all, Pennsylvania is home to fifty Fortune 500 companies.[128] Hershey is home to The Hershey Company, one of the largest chocolate manufacturers in the world. Erie is also home to GE Transportation, which is the largest producer of train locomotives in the United States. As in the US as a whole and in most states, the largest private employer in the Commonwealth is Walmart, followed by the University of Pennsylvania.[130][131] Pennsylvania is also home to the oldest investor-owned utility company in the US, The York Water Company. As of May 2020, the state's unemployment rate is 13.1%.[132] Year 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 GDP in mil.

After a series of mergers, the Bank of North America is part of Wells Fargo, which uses national charter 1. Pennsylvania is also the home to the first nationally chartered bank under the 1863 National Banking Act. That year, the Pittsburgh Savings & Trust Company received a national charter and renamed itself the First National Bank of Pittsburgh as part of the National Banking Act. That bank is still in existence today as PNC Financial Services and remains based in Pittsburgh. PNC is the state's largest bank and the sixth-largest in the United States. Agriculture[edit] Main article: Agriculture in Pennsylvania Pennsylvania ranks 19th overall in agricultural production.[136] The 1st is mushroom production, The 2nd is apples, The 3rd is Christmas trees and layer chickens, The 4th is nursery and sod, milk, corn for silage, grapes grown (including juice grapes), and horses production. It also ranks 8th in the nation in winemaking.[137] The Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture worked with private companies to establish ""PA Preferred"" as a way to brand agricultural products grown or made in the state to support and promote Pennsylvania products and locally grown food.[138] The financial impact of agriculture in Pennsylvania[139] includes employment of more than 66,800 people employed by the food manufacturing industry; and over $1.7 billion in food product export (in 2011). Gambling[edit] Main article: Gambling in Pennsylvania Casino gambling was legalized in Pennsylvania in 2004. Currently, there are nine casinos across the state with three under construction or in planning. Only horse racing, slot machines and electronic table games were legal in Pennsylvania, although a bill to legalize table games was being negotiated in the fall of 2009.[140] Table games such as poker, roulette, blackjack, and craps were finally approved by the state legislature in January 2010, being signed into law by the Governor on January 7. Former Governor Ed Rendell had considered legalizing video poker machines in bars and private clubs in 2009 since an estimated 17,000 operate illegally across the state.[141] Under this plan, any establishment with a liquor license would be allowed up to five machines. All machines would be connected to the state's computer system, like commercial casinos. The state would impose a 50% tax on net gambling revenues, after winning players have been paid, with the remaining 50% going to the establishment owners. Film[edit] The Pennsylvania Film Production Tax Credit began in 2004 and stimulated the development of a film industry in the state.[142] Governance[edit] Tom Wolf (D) 47th GovernorSince January 20, 2015John Fetterman (D) 34th Lt. GovernorSince January 15, 2019 Main article: Government of Pennsylvania See also: Commonwealth (U.S. state) Counties of Pennsylvania Pennsylvania has had five constitutions during its statehood:[143] 1776, 1790, 1838, 1874, and 1968. Before that the province of Pennsylvania was governed for a century by a Frame of Government, of which there were four versions: 1682, 1683, 1696, and 1701.[143] The capital of Pennsylvania is Harrisburg. The legislature meets in the State Capitol there. Executive[edit] Main article: List of Governors of Pennsylvania The current Governor is Tom Wolf. The other elected officials composing the executive branch are the Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman, Attorney General Joshua Shapiro, Auditor General Timothy DeFoor, and Pennsylvania Treasurer Stacy Garrity. The Governor and Lieutenant Governor run as a ticket in the general election and are up for re-election every four years during the midterm elections. The elections for Attorney General, Auditor General, and Treasurer are held every four years coinciding with a Presidential election.[144]See also: List of Pennsylvania state agencies Legislative[edit] Main article: Pennsylvania General Assembly The Pennsylvania State Capitol in Harrisburg. Pennsylvania has a bicameral legislature set up by Commonwealth's constitution in 1790. The original Frame of Government of William Penn had a unicameral legislature.[145] The General Assembly includes 50 Senators and 203 Representatives. Joe Scarnati is currently President Pro Tempore of the State Senate, Jake Corman the Majority Leader, and Jay Costa the Minority Leader.[146] Bryan Cutler is Speaker of the House of Representatives, with Kerry A. Benninghoff as Majority Leader and Frank Dermody as Minority Leader.[147] As of the 2018 elections, the Republicans hold the majority in the State House and Senate. Judiciary[edit] Main article: Unified Judicial System of Pennsylvania Pennsylvania is divided into 60 judicial districts,[148] most of which (except Philadelphia) have magisterial district judges (formerly called district justices and justices of the peace), who preside mainly over preliminary hearings in felony and misdemeanor offenses, all minor (summary) criminal offenses, and small civil claims.[148] Most criminal and civil cases originate in the Courts of Common Pleas, which also serve as appellate courts to the district judges and for local agency decisions.[148] The Superior Court hears all appeals from the Courts of Common Pleas not expressly designated to the Commonwealth Court or Supreme Court. It also has original jurisdiction to review warrants for wiretap surveillance.[148] The Commonwealth Court is limited to appeals from final orders of certain state agencies and certain designated cases from the Courts of Common Pleas.[148] The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania is the final appellate court. All judges in Pennsylvania are elected; the chief justice is determined by seniority.[148] State law enforcement[edit] The Pennsylvania State Police is the chief law enforcement agency in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Politics[edit] Main article: Politics of Pennsylvania The 2016 Democratic National Convention was held in Philadelphia. Since the latter half of the 20th century, Pennsylvania has been a powerful swing state. It supported the losing candidate in a presidential election only twice between 1932 to 1988, faltering in 1932 and 1968 with Herbert Hoover and Hubert Humphrey, respectively. Between 1992 and 2016, Pennsylvania trended Democratic in presidential elections, voting for Bill Clinton twice by large margins, and by a slightly closer margin for Al Gore in 2000. In the 2004 presidential election, Senator John F. Kerry beat President George W. Bush in Pennsylvania, 2,938,095 (50%) to 2,793,847 (48%). In the 2008 presidential election, Democrat Barack Obama defeated Republican John McCain in Pennsylvania, 3,184,778 (54%) to 2,584,088 (44%). By the 2016 presidential election, Republican Donald Trump broke the Democratic streak of the state, winning by 2,970,733 (48%) votes to 2,926,441 (47%) votes.[149] The state returned to the Democratic column in 2020 by narrowly voting for Joe Biden over Trump, 3,458,229 (50%) to 3,377,674 (48%). The state holds 20 electoral votes.[150] In recent national elections since 1992, Pennsylvania had leaned for the Democratic Party. The state voted for the Democratic ticket for president in every election between 1992 and 2012. During the 2008 election campaign, a recruitment drive saw registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans by 1.2 million. However, Pennsylvania has a history of electing Republican senators. From 2009 to 2011, the state was represented by two Democratic senators for the first time since 1947 after Republican Senator Arlen Specter switched party affiliation. In 2010, Republicans recaptured a U.S. Senate seat as well as a majority of the state's congressional seats, control of both chambers of the state legislature and the governor's mansion. Democrats won back the governor's mansion four years later in the 2014 election. It was the first time since a governor became eligible to succeed himself that an incumbent governor had been defeated for reelection. Voter registration totals as of July 5, 2021[151] Party Registered voters Percentage Democratic 4,039,596 (-189,292) 46.28% Republican 3,419,730 (-123,340) 39.17% Minor parties 1,269,827 (-49,177) 14.54% Total 8,729,153 (-361,809) 100% *Lost between November 3, 2020 and July 5, 2021. Historically, Democratic strength was concentrated in Philadelphia in the southeast, the Pittsburgh and Johnstown areas in the southwest, and Scranton/Wilkes-Barre in the northeast. Republican strength was concentrated in the Philadelphia suburbs, as well as the more rural areas in the central, northeastern, and western portions. The latter counties have long been among the most conservative areas in the nation. Since 1992, however, the Philadelphia suburbs have swung Democratic; the brand of Republicanism there was traditionally a moderate one. The Pittsburgh suburbs, historically a Democratic stronghold, have swung more Republican since the turn of the millennium. Democratic political consultant James Carville once pejoratively described Pennsylvania as ""Philadelphia in the east, Pittsburgh in the west and Alabama in the middle"". Political analysts and editorials refer to central Pennsylvania as the ""T"" in statewide elections. The Three Valleys (Delaware, Lehigh, and Wyoming) and greater Pittsburgh generally vote for Democratic candidates, while the majority of the counties in the central part of the state vote Republican. As a result, maps showing the results of statewide elections invariably form a ""T"" shape. Taxation[edit] Pennsylvania had the 15th-highest state and local tax burden in the United States in 2012, according to the Tax Foundation.[152] Residents paid a total of $83.7 billion in state and local taxes with a per capita average of $4,589 annually. Residents share 76% of the total tax burden. Many state politicians have tried to increase the share of taxes paid by out-of-state sources. Suggested revenue sources include taxing natural gas drilling as Pennsylvania is the only state without such a tax on gas drilling.[153] Additional revenue prospects include trying to place tolls on interstate highways; specifically Interstate 80, which is used heavily by out of state commuters with high maintenance costs.[154] Sales taxes provide 39% of the Commonwealth's revenue; personal income taxes 34%; motor vehicle taxes about 12%, and taxes on cigarettes and alcoholic beverages 5%.[155] The personal income tax is a flat 3.07%. An individual's taxable income is based on the following eight types of income: compensation (salary); interest; dividends; net profits from the operation of a business, profession or farm; net gains or income from the dispositions of property; net gains or income from rents, royalties, patents and copyrights; income derived through estates or trusts; and gambling and lottery winnings (other than Pennsylvania Lottery winnings).[156] Counties, municipalities, and school districts levy taxes on real estate. In addition, some local bodies assess a wage tax on personal income. Generally, the total wage tax rate is capped at 1% of income but some municipalities with home rule charters may charge more than 1%. Thirty-two of the Commonwealth's sixty-seven counties levy a personal property tax on stocks, bonds, and similar holdings. With the exception of the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, municipalities and school districts are allowed to enact a local earned income tax within the purview of Act 32. Residents of these municipalities and school districts are required to file a local income tax return in addition to federal and state returns. This local return is filed with the local income tax collector, a private collection agency appointed by a particular county to collect the local earned income and local services tax (the latter a flat fee deducted from salaried employees working within a particular municipality or school district).[157][158][159][160] The City of Philadelphia has its own local income taxation system. Philadelphia-based employers are required to withhold the Philadelphia wage tax from the salaries of their employees. Residents of Philadelphia working for an employer are not required to file a local return as long as their Philadelphia wage tax is fully withheld by their employer. If their employer does not withhold the Philadelphia wage tax, residents are required to register with the Revenue Department and file an Earnings Tax return. Residents of Philadelphia with self-employment income are required to file a Net Profits Tax (NPT) return, while those with business income from Philadelphia sources are required to obtain a Commercial Activity License (CAL) and pay the Business Income and Receipts Tax (BIRT) and the NPT. Residents with unearned income (except for interest from checking and savings accounts) are required to file and pay the School Income-tax (SIT).[161] The complexity of Pennsylvania's local tax filing system has been criticized by experts, who note that the outsourcing of collections to private entities is akin to tax farming and that many new residents are caught off guard and end up facing ""failure to file"" penalties even if they did not owe any tax. Attempts to transfer local income tax collections to the state level (i.e. by having a separate local section on the state income tax return, currently the method used to collect local income taxes in New York, Maryland, Indiana, and Iowa) have been unsuccessful.[162] Federal representation[edit] Main article: Pennsylvania's congressional districts Pennsylvania's two U.S. Senators are Democrat Bob Casey, Jr. and Republican Pat Toomey. Pennsylvania has 18 seats in the United States House of Representatives, as of the 2010 Census.[163] Health[edit] Pennsylvania has a mixed health record, and is ranked as the 29th-overall-healthiest state according to the 2013 United Health Foundation's Health Rankings.[164] Education[edit] Main article: Education in Pennsylvania Pennsylvania has 500 public school districts, thousands of private schools, publicly funded colleges and universities, and over 100 private institutions of higher education. Primary and secondary education[edit] In general, under state law, school attendance in Pennsylvania is mandatory for a child from the age of 8 until the age of 17, or until graduation from an accredited high school, whichever is earlier.[165] As of 2005, 83.8% of Pennsylvania residents age 18 to 24 have completed high school. Among residents age 25 and over, 86.7% have graduated from high school. The following are the four-year graduation rates for students completing high school in 2016:[166] Cohort All Students Male Female White Hispanic Black Asian Special Education % graduating 86.09 84.14 88.13 90.48 72.83 73.22 91.21 74.06 Additionally, 27.5% have gone on to obtain a bachelor's degree or higher.[167] State students consistently do well in standardized testing. In 2007, Pennsylvania ranked 14th in mathematics, 12th in reading, and 10th in writing for 8th grade students.[168] In 1988, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed Act 169, which allows parents or guardians to homeschool their children as an option for compulsory school attendance. This law specifies the requirements and responsibilities of the parents and the school district where the family lives.[169] Higher education[edit] See also: List of colleges and universities in Pennsylvania The Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE) is the public university system of the Commonwealth, with 14 state-owned schools. West Chester University has by far the largest student body of the 14 universities. The Commonwealth System of Higher Education is an organizing body of the four state-related schools in Pennsylvania; these schools (Pennsylvania State University, Lincoln University, the University of Pittsburgh, and Temple University) are independent institutions that receive some state funding. There are also 15 publicly funded two-year community colleges and technical schools that are separate from the PASSHE system. Additionally, there are many private two- and four-year technical schools, colleges, and universities. Carnegie Mellon University, The Pennsylvania State University, the University of Pennsylvania, and the University of Pittsburgh are members of the Association of American Universities, an invitation-only organization of leading research universities. Lehigh University is a private research university located in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania State University is the Commonwealth's land-grant university, Sea Grant College and, Space Grant College. The University of Pennsylvania, located in Philadelphia, is considered the first university in the United States and established the country's first medical school. The University of Pennsylvania is also the Commonwealth's only, and geographically most southern, Ivy League school. The Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine (LECOM) is a private graduate school of medicine, dentistry, and pharmacy with a main campus in Erie, Pennsylvania, and a branch campus located in Greensburg, Pennsylvania (with two other campuses outside of Pennsylvania). With over 2,200 enrolled medical students, the College of Osteopathic Medicine at LECOM is the largest medical school in the United States.[170][171][172][173] The Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts is the first and oldest art school in the United States.[174] Philadelphia College of Pharmacy, now a part of University of the Sciences in Philadelphia, was the first pharmacy school in the United States.[175] Recreation[edit] Dorney Park and Wildwater Kingdom's Steel Force and Thunderhawk roller coasters in Allentown Pennsylvania is home to the nation's first zoo, the Philadelphia Zoo.[176] Other long-accredited AZA zoos include the Erie Zoo and the Pittsburgh Zoo & PPG Aquarium. The Lehigh Valley Zoo and ZOOAMERICA are other notable zoos. The Commonwealth boasts some of the finest museums in the country, including the Carnegie Museums in Pittsburgh, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and several others. One unique museum is the Houdini Museum in Scranton, the only building in the world devoted to the legendary magician.[177] Pennsylvania is also home to the National Aviary, located in Pittsburgh. All 121 state parks in Pennsylvania feature free admission. Pennsylvania offers a number of notable amusement parks, including Kalahari Resorts Poconos, Camel Beach, Conneaut Lake Park, Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom, Dutch Wonderland, DelGrosso's Amusement Park, Hersheypark, Idlewild Park, Kennywood, Knoebels, Lakemont Park, Sandcastle Waterpark, Sesame Place, Great Wolf Lodge and Waldameer Park. Pennsylvania also is home to the largest indoor waterpark resort on the East Coast, Splash Lagoon in Erie. There are also notable music festivals that take place in Pennsylvania. These include Musikfest and NEARfest in Bethlehem, the Philadelphia Folk Festival, Creation Festival, the Great Allentown Fair, and Purple Door. There are nearly one million licensed hunters in Pennsylvania. Whitetail deer, black bear, cottontail rabbits, squirrel, turkey, and grouse are common game species. Pennsylvania is considered one of the finest wild turkey hunting states in the Union, alongside Texas and Alabama. Sport hunting in Pennsylvania provides a massive boost for the Commonwealth's economy. A report from The Center for Rural Pennsylvania (a Legislative Agency of the Pennsylvania General Assembly) reported that hunting, fishing, and furtaking generated a total of $9.6 billion statewide. The Boone and Crockett Club shows that five of the ten largest (skull size) black bear entries came from the state.[178] The state also has a tied record for the largest hunter shot black bear in the Boone & Crockett books at 733 lb (332 kg) and a skull of 23 3/16 tied with a bear shot in California in 1993.[178] The largest bear ever found dead was in Utah in 1975, and the second-largest was shot by a poacher in the state in 1987.[178] Pennsylvania holds the second-highest number of Boone & Crockett-recorded record black bears at 183, second only to Wisconsin's 299.[178] Transportation[edit] See also: List of airports in Pennsylvania, List of public transit authorities in Pennsylvania, and List of Pennsylvania railroads Road[edit] The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, abbreviated as PennDOT, owns 39,861 miles (64,150 km) of the 121,770 miles (195,970 km) of roadway in the state, making it the fifth-largest state highway system in the United States.[179] The Pennsylvania Turnpike system is 535 miles (861 km) long, with the mainline portion stretching from Ohio to Philadelphia and New Jersey.[179] It is overseen by the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission. Another major east–west route is Interstate 80, which runs primarily in the northern tier of the state from Ohio to New Jersey at the Delaware Water Gap. Interstate 90 travels the relatively short distance between Ohio and New York through Erie County, in the extreme northwestern part of the state. Primary north–south highways are Interstate 79 from its terminus in Erie through Pittsburgh to West Virginia, Interstate 81 from New York through Scranton, Lackawanna County and Harrisburg to Maryland and Interstate 476, which begins 7 miles (11 km) north of the Delaware border, in Chester, Delaware County and travels 132 miles (212 km) to Clarks Summit, Lackawanna County, where it joins I-81. All but 20 miles (32 km) of I-476 is the Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike, while the highway south of the mainline of the Pennsylvania Turnpike is officially called the ""Veterans Memorial Highway"", but is commonly referred to by locals as the ""Blue Route"". Rail[edit] The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) is the sixth-largest transit agency in the United States and operates the commuter, heavy and light rail transit, and transit bus service in the Philadelphia metropolitan area. The Port Authority of Allegheny County is the 25th-largest transit agency and provides transit bus and light rail service in and around Pittsburgh.[180] U.S. Route 220 as it passes through Lamar Township Intercity passenger rail transit is provided by Amtrak, with the majority of traffic occurring on the Keystone Service in the high-speed Keystone Corridor between Harrisburg and Philadelphia's 30th Street Station before heading north to New York City, as well as the Northeast Regional providing frequent high-speed service up and down the Northeast Corridor. The Pennsylvanian follows the same route from New York City to Harrisburg, but extends out to Pittsburgh. The Capitol Limited also passes through Pittsburgh, as well as Connellsville, on its way from Chicago to Washington, D.C.[181] Traveling between Chicago and New York City, the Lake Shore Limited passes through Erie once in each direction.[181] There are 67 short-line, freight railroads operating in Pennsylvania, the highest number in any U.S. state.[181] Bus and coach[edit] Intercity bus service is provided between cities in Pennsylvania and other major points in the Northeast by Bolt Bus, Fullington Trailways, Greyhound Lines, Martz Trailways, Megabus, OurBus, Trans-Bridge Lines, as well as various Chinatown bus companies. In 2018, OurBus began offering service from West Chester, PA – Malvern, PA – King of Prussia, PA – Fort Washington, PA – New York, NY. Air[edit] Pennsylvania has seven major airports: Philadelphia International, Pittsburgh International, Lehigh Valley International, Harrisburg International, Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International, Erie International, and University Park Airport. A total of 134 public-use airports are located in the state.[181] The port of Pittsburgh is the second-largest inland port in the United States and the 18th-largest port overall; the Port of Philadelphia is the 24th-largest port in the United States.[182] Pennsylvania's only port on the Great Lakes is located in Erie. Water[edit] The Allegheny River Lock and Dam Two is the most-used lock operated by the United States Army Corps of Engineers of its 255 nationwide.[183] The dam impounds the Allegheny River near Downtown Pittsburgh.

The first World Series between the Boston Pilgrims (which became the Boston Red Sox) and Pittsburgh Pirates was played in Pittsburgh in 1903. Since 1959, the Little League World Series is held each summer in South Williamsport, near where Little League Baseball was founded in Williamsport.[184] Soccer is gaining popularity within the state as well. With the addition of the Philadelphia Union in the MLS, the state now boasts three teams that are eligible to compete for the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup annually. The other two teams are Philadelphia Union II and the Pittsburgh Riverhounds. However, Penn FC (formally Harrisburg City Islanders) used to be one of these teams before they announced they'd be on hiatus in 2019; although they would be returning for the 2020 season.[185] Both of the United Soccer League (USL). Within the American Soccer Pyramid, the MLS takes the first tier, while the USL-2 claims the third tier. NASCAR racing at Pocono Raceway in Long Pond Arnold Palmer, one of the 20th century's most notable pro golfers, comes from Latrobe, while Jim Furyk, a current PGA member, grew up near in Lancaster. PGA tournaments in Pennsylvania include the 84 Lumber Classic, played at Nemacolin Woodlands Resort, in Farmington and the Northeast Pennsylvania Classic, played at Glenmaura National Golf Club, in Moosic. Philadelphia is home to LOVE Park, once a popular spot for skateboarding, and across from City Hall, host to ESPN's X Games in 2001 and 2002.[186] Racing[edit] In motorsports, the Mario Andretti dynasty of race drivers hails from Nazareth in the Lehigh Valley. Notable racetracks in Pennsylvania include the Jennerstown Speedway in Jennerstown, the Lake Erie Speedway in North East, the Mahoning Valley Speedway in Lehighton, the Motordrome Speedway (closed) in Smithton, the Mountain Speedway in St. Johns, the Nazareth Speedway in Nazareth (closed); the Lernerville Speedway in Sarver and the Pocono Raceway in Long Pond, which is home to two NASCAR Cup Series races and an IndyCar Series race. The state is also home to Maple Grove Raceway, near Reading, which hosts major National Hot Rod Association sanctioned drag racing events each year. There are also two motocross race tracks that host a round of the AMA Toyota Motocross Championships in Pennsylvania. High Point Raceway is located in Mt. Morris, Pennsylvania, and Steel City is located in Delmont, Pennsylvania. Horse racing courses in Pennsylvania consist of The Meadows near Pittsburgh, Pocono Downs in Wilkes-Barre, and Harrah's Philadelphia in Chester, which offer harness racing, and Penn National Race Course in Grantville, Parx Racing (formerly Philadelphia Park) in Bensalem, and Presque Isle Downs near Erie, which offer thoroughbred racing. Smarty Jones, the 2004 Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes winner, had Philadelphia Park as his home course. College sports[edit] College football is popular in Pennsylvania.[citation needed] There are three colleges in Pennsylvania that play at the highest level of collegiate football competition, the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision. Two play in Power Five conferences, the Penn State University Nittany Lions of the Big Ten Conference and the University of Pittsburgh Panthers of the Atlantic Coast Conference, while the Temple University Owls play in the American Athletic Conference. Penn State claims two national championships (1982 & 1986) as well as seven undefeated seasons (1887, 1912, 1968, 1969, 1973, 1986 and 1994). Penn State plays its home games in the second-largest stadium in the United States, Beaver Stadium, which seats 106,572, and is currently led by head coach James Franklin. The University of Pittsburgh Panthers claims nine national championships (1915, 1916, 1918, 1929, 1931, 1934, 1936, 1937 and 1976) and has played eight undefeated seasons (1904, 1910, 1915, 1916, 1917, 1920, 1937 and 1976).[187] Pitt plays its home games at Heinz Field, a facility it shares with the Pittsburgh Steelers, and is led by current head football coach Pat Narduzzi. Other Pennsylvania schools that have won national titles in football include Lafayette College (1896), Villanova University (FCS 2009), the University of Pennsylvania (1895, 1897, 1904 and 1908)[188] and Washington and Jefferson College (1921). College basketball is also popular in the state, especially in the Philadelphia area where five universities, collectively termed the Big Five, have a rich tradition in NCAA Division I basketball. National titles in college basketball have been won by La Salle University (1954), Temple University (1938), University of Pennsylvania (1920 and 1921), University of Pittsburgh (1928 and 1930), and Villanova University (1985, 2016, and 2018).[189][190] Food[edit] Further information: Category:Cuisine of Pennsylvania Hershey Chocolate Factory Author Sharon Hernes Silverman calls Pennsylvania the snack food capital of the world.[191] It leads all other states in the manufacture of pretzels and potato chips. The Sturgis Pretzel House introduced the pretzel to America, and companies like Anderson Bakery Company, Intercourse Pretzel Factory, and Snyder's of Hanover are leading manufacturers in the Commonwealth. Two of the three companies that define the U.S. potato chip industry are based in Pennsylvania: Utz Quality Foods, which started making chips in Hanover, Pennsylvania, in 1921 and Wise Foods, which started making chips in Berwick also in 1921. The third, Frito-Lay is part of PepsiCo, and is based in Plano, Texas. Other companies such as Herr's Snacks, Martin's Potato Chips, Snyder's of Berlin (not associated with Snyder's of Hanover) and Troyer Farms Potato Products are popular chip manufacturers. The U.S. chocolate industry is centered in Hershey, Pennsylvania, with Mars, Godiva, and Wilbur Chocolate Company nearby, and smaller manufacturers such as Asher's[192] in Souderton,[193] and Gertrude Hawk Chocolates of Dunmore. Other notable companies include Just Born in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, makers of Hot Tamales, Mike and Ikes, the Easter favorite marshmallow Peeps, and Boyer Brothers of Altoona, Pennsylvania, which is well known for its Mallo Cups. Auntie Anne's Pretzels began as a market-stand in Downingtown, Pennsylvania, and now has corporate headquarters in Lancaster City.[194] Traditional Pennsylvania Dutch foods include chicken potpie, ham potpie, schnitz un knepp (dried apples, ham, and dumplings), fasnachts (raised doughnuts), scrapple, pretzels, bologna, chow-chow, and Shoofly pie. Martin's Famous Pastry Shoppe, Inc., headquartered in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, specializes in potato bread, another traditional Pennsylvania Dutch food. D.G. Yuengling & Son, America's oldest brewery, has been brewing beer in Pottsville since 1829. Among the regional foods associated with Philadelphia are cheesesteaks, hoagie, soft pretzels, Italian water ice, Irish potato candy, scrapple, Tastykake, and strombolis. In Pittsburgh, tomato ketchup was improved by Henry John Heinz from 1876 to the early 20th century. Famous to a lesser extent than Heinz ketchup is the Pittsburgh's Primanti Brothers Restaurant sandwiches, pierogies, and city chicken. Outside of Scranton, in Old Forge there are dozens of Italian restaurants specializing in pizza made unique by thick, light crust and American cheese. Erie also has its share of unique foods, including Greek sauce and sponge candy. Sauerkraut along with pork and mashed potatoes is a common meal on New Year's Day in Pennsylvania. Nicknames[edit] Pennsylvania has been known as the Keystone State since 1802,[195] based in part upon its central location among the original Thirteen Colonies forming the United States, and also in part because of the number of important American documents signed in the state (such as the Declaration of Independence). It was also a keystone state economically, having both the industry common to the North (making such wares as Conestoga wagons and rifles)[196][197] and the agriculture common to the South (producing feed, fiber, food, and tobacco).[198] Another one of Pennsylvania's nicknames is the Quaker State; in colonial times, it was known officially as the Quaker Province,[199] in recognition of Quaker[200] William Penn's First Frame of Government[201] constitution for Pennsylvania that guaranteed liberty of conscience. He knew of the hostility[202] Quakers faced when they opposed religious ritual, taking oaths, violence, war and military service, and what they viewed as ostentatious frippery.[203] ""The Coal State"", ""The Oil State"", ""The Chocolate State"", and ""The Steel State"" were adopted when those were the state's greatest industries.[204] ""The State of Independence"" currently appears on many road signs entering the state.

With over US$6 billion in assets, its stated mission is to serve the public interest by ""improving public policy, informing the public, and invigorating civic life"".[1] Contents 1 History 2 Current concerns 2.1 Maritime protection 2.2 Pew Research Center 2.3 Justice and corrections reform 2.4 Health 3 Finances 4 Controversy 4.1 Barnes Art Collection 4.2 Texas Public Policy Foundation 5 References 6 External links History[edit] The Trusts was established by the merging of several charitable funds that had been established between 1948 and 1979. The original funds were created by J. Howard Pew, Mary Ethel Pew, Joseph N. Pew Jr., and Mabel Pew Myrin—the adult sons and daughters of Sun Oil Company founder Joseph N. Pew and his wife, Mary Anderson Pew. Honoring their parents' religious conviction that good works should be done quietly, the original Pew Memorial Foundation[2] was a grantmaking organization that made donations anonymously. The foundation became the Pew Memorial Trust in 1956, based in Philadelphia, the donors' hometown. Between 1957 and 1979, six other trusts were created, representing the personal and complementary philanthropic interests of the four siblings.[3][4] The Trusts continues to be based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with offices in Washington, D.C., London, and Brussels. Although today The Pew Charitable Trusts is non-partisan and non-ideological, Joseph Pew and his sons were politically conservative. The modern day organization works to encourage responsive government and support scientific research on a wide range of issues, including global ocean governance, correction reform, and antibiotic resistance. Early priorities of the Pew Memorial Trust included cancer research, the American Red Cross, and a pioneering project to assist historically black colleges. Later beneficiaries included conservative organizations such as the John Birch Society, the American Liberty League, and the American Enterprise Institute, as well as environmental organizations such as the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Oceana, and mainstream think tanks like the center-left Brookings Institution.[5][6] The Trusts continues to fund charities and the arts in Philadelphia. In 2004, the Pew Trusts applied to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to change its status from private foundation to nonprofit organization. Since that change it can now raise funds freely and devote up to 5% of its budget to lobbying the public sector. According to the Pew Trusts' website, five of the ten Directors serving on the Board are named Pew.[7] Current concerns[edit] Part of the Pew's mission includes a number of public policy projects. These projects focus on specific public policy issues: modernization of the civil legal system, Philadelphia local public policies; justice and public safety; student loans; ocean and fisheries protection; conservation of public lands and rivers; consumer finance and the greater economy; government reform; and public health issues.[8] Maritime protection[edit] The Trusts, with other groups, backed an effort to create marine protected areas in the Pacific Ocean, near the Mariana Islands.[9] The protected area was officially designated in January 2009, and includes the Mariana Trench, the deepest ocean canyon in the world. Another marine protected area that the Trusts and other groups sought to protect is Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument which was protected by President Bush in 2006[10] and expanded by President Obama in 2016.[11] Pew Research Center[edit] The Trusts also funds the Pew Research Center, the third-largest think tank in Washington, D.C., after the Brookings Institution and the Center for American Progress. Justice and corrections reform[edit] The Trusts have worked closely with the Vera Institute of Justice on issues related to state correction policies in the Public Safety Performance Project.[12] In 2008, Pew reported that more than one in 100 adults in the United States is in jail or prison, an all-time high. The cost to state governments is nearly $50 billion a year and the federal government $5 billion more. The report compiled and analyzed data from the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics and Federal Bureau of Prisons and each state's department of corrections.[13][14] Pew reported in 2009 that ""explosive growth in the number of people on probation or parole has propelled the population of the American corrections system to more than 7.3 million, or 1 in every 31 U.S. adults."" ""One in 31: The Long Reach of American Corrections""[15] examined the scale and cost of prison, jail, probation and parole in each of the 50 states, and provides a blueprint for states to cut both crime and spending by reallocating prison expenses to fund stronger supervision of the large number of offenders in the community. Pew supported police reforms enacted by the state of Washington in 2021. Gov. Jay Inslee (D-WA) signed 12 separate police reform bills that would, among other things, require officers to intervene when they see another officer using excessive force, which happened during the brutal police murder of George Floyd in Minnesota 2020.[16] Health[edit] ""Based on data, science, and non-partisan research, Pew works to reduce hidden risks to the health, safety, and well-being of American consumers.""[17] One program, the Pew Scholars Program in the Biomedical Sciences, is intended to support promising early and mid-career scientists investigating human health, both basic and clinical.[18] The awards provide flexible support ($240,000 over a four-year period). Grantees are encouraged to be entrepreneurial and innovative in their research.[19] In October 2020, the Trusts unveiled research on naloxone, the lifesaving overdose reversal drug. Pew researchers concluded that expanded access to naloxone saves lives and put forth several recommendations on how to do so, including options such as co-prescribing naloxone with opioids.[20] During the rollout of vaccines for the COVID-19 pandemic, Pew supported the CDC's determination that potentially ""wasting vaccines"" in order to quickly vaccinate teenagers, which was considered a major policy shift by the CDC.[21] Finances[edit] According to the 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements, as of 30 June 2019, the Trusts owned over US$6.7 billion in assets. For the 12 months ending on that date, total revenues were about US$374 million and total expenses were about $341 million, of which about $6.6 million were for fundraising expenses.[22] Controversy[edit] Barnes Art Collection[edit] The Trusts have supported the relocation of the famed Barnes Art Collection from its longtime home in Lower Merion, PA, to Center City. This has been controversial in the art world. The Barnes Foundation was established by Albert C. Barnes in 1922 to ""promote the advancement of education and the appreciation of the fine arts and horticulture.""[23] According to the Barnes Foundation:[24]""The Barnes is home to one of the world's largest collections of Impressionist, Post-Impressionist and early Modern paintings, with especially deep holdings by Renoir, Matisse, and Picasso"", as well as important examples of African art, Native American pottery and jewelry, Pennsylvania German furniture, American avant-garde painting, and wrought-iron metalwork.""Opponents of relocating the collection to a new museum along the Benjamin Franklin Parkway said that move violates Barnes' will that the collection stay intact at its original location and not be loaned, transferred or sold. Columnist Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote in 2010, ""It is perfectly clear exactly what Barnes specified in his will. It was drawn up by the best legal minds. It is clear that what happened to his collection was against his wishes.""[25] Yet the Barnes Foundation prevailed in a series of legal actions and the new museum opened on May 16, 2012. At the opening Barnes trustee and treasurer Stephen Harmelin noted, ""There were financial challenges to be faced...questions about how the foundation as it existed could go on with its mission, worries about the safety and integrity of the collection in the long run,"" he said. ""We were convinced that the only change that could save the Barnes was to redouble our commitment to its mission, to reach out more widely than ever before, to build, to expand and to move the collection to a more accessible location.""[26] The Trusts became involved with the Barnes Collection when the foundation overseeing the art collection had serious financial trouble, ultimately contributing more than $20 million for a new museum. Reporter Roberta Smith of the New York Times said of the new building, ""Against all odds, the museum that opens to the public on Saturday is still very much the old Barnes, only better.""[27] The controversy involving Pew, other donors, the Barnes trustees and the collection was the subject of a documentary film The Art of the Steal. The Trusts did not participate in the film. Rebecca Rimel, then head of The Pew Charitable Trusts, said they believed the film would not be fair.[28] Texas Public Policy Foundation[edit] Between 2011 and 2015, The Pew Charitable Trusts gave $4.7 million to the Texas Public Policy Foundation (TPPF), earmarked specifically for the foundation's criminal justice reform project.[29][30] References[edit] ^ ""How We Work"".

It applies a rigorous, analytical approach to improve public policy, inform the public and stimulate civic life. The Trusts is led by President and CEO Rebecca W. Rimel, who has concentrated the organization’s work on results-oriented, strategic investments. During Rimel’s tenure, the organization has expanded its national programs, while maintaining a significant presence in its home city of Philadelphia. In fiscal year 2008, The Pew Charitable Trusts has invested about $300 million in initiatives to serve the public interest. In 2004, The Trusts established the Pew Research Center as a subsidiary to house six separate information projects that The Trusts had launched during the preceding decade. The move was designed to expand the reach of these information projects and to reduce their administrative cost. The Trusts provides the vast bulk of the Pew Research Center’s financial support and appoints three of the five voting members of the Center’s governing board. However, the Center is solely responsible for its own surveys, reports and findings. In order to preserve the Center’s independence and impartiality, The Trusts maintains a wall of separation between its support for the Center’s information work and its support for projects that seek to advance policy solutions, just as most newspapers separate their news operation from their editorial pages. 1615 L St. NW, Suite 800Washington, DC 20036USA (+1) 202-419-4300 | Main (+1) 202-857-8562 | Fax (+1) 202-419-4372 | Media Inquiries Research Topics Politics & PolicyInternational AffairsImmigration & MigrationRace & EthnicityReligionGenerations & AgeGender & LGBTFamily & RelationshipsEconomy & WorkScienceInternet & TechnologyNews Habits & MediaMethodological ResearchFull topic list Follow Us Email Newsletters Facebook Twitter Tumblr YouTube RSS About Pew Research Center Pew Research Center is a nonpartisan fact tank that informs the public about the issues, attitudes and trends shaping the world.

Later beneficiaries included conservative organizations such as the John Birch Society, the American Liberty League, and the American Enterprise Institute, as well as environmental organizations such as the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Oceana, and mainstream think tanks like the center-left Brookings Institution.[5][6] The Trusts continues to fund charities and the arts in Philadelphia. In 2004, the Pew Trusts applied to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to change its status from private foundation to nonprofit organization. Since that change it can now raise funds freely and devote up to 5% of its budget to lobbying the public sector. According to the Pew Trusts' website, five of the ten Directors serving on the Board are named Pew.[7] Current concerns[edit] Part of the Pew's mission includes a number of public policy projects. These projects focus on specific public policy issues: modernization of the civil legal system, Philadelphia local public policies; justice and public safety; student loans; ocean and fisheries protection; conservation of public lands and rivers; consumer finance and the greater economy; government reform; and public health issues.[8] Maritime protection[edit] The Trusts, with other groups, backed an effort to create marine protected areas in the Pacific Ocean, near the Mariana Islands.[9] The protected area was officially designated in January 2009, and includes the Mariana Trench, the deepest ocean canyon in the world. Another marine protected area that the Trusts and other groups sought to protect is Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument which was protected by President Bush in 2006[10] and expanded by President Obama in 2016.[11] Pew Research Center[edit] The Trusts also funds the Pew Research Center, the third-largest think tank in Washington, D.C., after the Brookings Institution and the Center for American Progress. Justice and corrections reform[edit] The Trusts have worked closely with the Vera Institute of Justice on issues related to state correction policies in the Public Safety Performance Project.[12] In 2008, Pew reported that more than one in 100 adults in the United States is in jail or prison, an all-time high. The cost to state governments is nearly $50 billion a year and the federal government $5 billion more. The report compiled and analyzed data from the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics and Federal Bureau of Prisons and each state's department of corrections.[13][14] Pew reported in 2009 that ""explosive growth in the number of people on probation or parole has propelled the population of the American corrections system to more than 7.3 million, or 1 in every 31 U.S. adults."" ""One in 31: The Long Reach of American Corrections""[15] examined the scale and cost of prison, jail, probation and parole in each of the 50 states, and provides a blueprint for states to cut both crime and spending by reallocating prison expenses to fund stronger supervision of the large number of offenders in the community. Pew supported police reforms enacted by the state of Washington in 2021. Gov. Jay Inslee (D-WA) signed 12 separate police reform bills that would, among other things, require officers to intervene when they see another officer using excessive force, which happened during the brutal police murder of George Floyd in Minnesota 2020.[16] Health[edit] ""Based on data, science, and non-partisan research, Pew works to reduce hidden risks to the health, safety, and well-being of American consumers.""[17] One program, the Pew Scholars Program in the Biomedical Sciences, is intended to support promising early and mid-career scientists investigating human health, both basic and clinical.[18] The awards provide flexible support ($240,000 over a four-year period). Grantees are encouraged to be entrepreneurial and innovative in their research.[19] In October 2020, the Trusts unveiled research on naloxone, the lifesaving overdose reversal drug. Pew researchers concluded that expanded access to naloxone saves lives and put forth several recommendations on how to do so, including options such as co-prescribing naloxone with opioids.[20] During the rollout of vaccines for the COVID-19 pandemic, Pew supported the CDC's determination that potentially ""wasting vaccines"" in order to quickly vaccinate teenagers, which was considered a major policy shift by the CDC.[21] Finances[edit] According to the 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements, as of 30 June 2019, the Trusts owned over US$6.7 billion in assets. For the 12 months ending on that date, total revenues were about US$374 million and total expenses were about $341 million, of which about $6.6 million were for fundraising expenses.[22] Controversy[edit] Barnes Art Collection[edit] The Trusts have supported the relocation of the famed Barnes Art Collection from its longtime home in Lower Merion, PA, to Center City. This has been controversial in the art world. The Barnes Foundation was established by Albert C. Barnes in 1922 to ""promote the advancement of education and the appreciation of the fine arts and horticulture.""[23] According to the Barnes Foundation:[24]""The Barnes is home to one of the world's largest collections of Impressionist, Post-Impressionist and early Modern paintings, with especially deep holdings by Renoir, Matisse, and Picasso"", as well as important examples of African art, Native American pottery and jewelry, Pennsylvania German furniture, American avant-garde painting, and wrought-iron metalwork.""Opponents of relocating the collection to a new museum along the Benjamin Franklin Parkway said that move violates Barnes' will that the collection stay intact at its original location and not be loaned, transferred or sold. Columnist Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote in 2010, ""It is perfectly clear exactly what Barnes specified in his will. It was drawn up by the best legal minds. It is clear that what happened to his collection was against his wishes.""[25] Yet the Barnes Foundation prevailed in a series of legal actions and the new museum opened on May 16, 2012. At the opening Barnes trustee and treasurer Stephen Harmelin noted, ""There were financial challenges to be faced...questions about how the foundation as it existed could go on with its mission, worries about the safety and integrity of the collection in the long run,"" he said. ""We were convinced that the only change that could save the Barnes was to redouble our commitment to its mission, to reach out more widely than ever before, to build, to expand and to move the collection to a more accessible location.""[26] The Trusts became involved with the Barnes Collection when the foundation overseeing the art collection had serious financial trouble, ultimately contributing more than $20 million for a new museum. Reporter Roberta Smith of the New York Times said of the new building, ""Against all odds, the museum that opens to the public on Saturday is still very much the old Barnes, only better.""[27] The controversy involving Pew, other donors, the Barnes trustees and the collection was the subject of a documentary film The Art of the Steal. The Trusts did not participate in the film. Rebecca Rimel, then head of The Pew Charitable Trusts, said they believed the film would not be fair.[28] Texas Public Policy Foundation[edit] Between 2011 and 2015, The Pew Charitable Trusts gave $4.7 million to the Texas Public Policy Foundation (TPPF), earmarked specifically for the foundation's criminal justice reform project.[29][30] References[edit] ^ ""How We Work"".

In 2016, Plan International reached 17.1 million girls and 15.5 million boys through its programming.[citation needed] Plan International focuses on child protection, education, child participation, economic security, emergencies, health, sexual and reproductive health and rights, and water and sanitation. Plan International provides training in disaster preparedness, response and recovery, and has worked on relief efforts in countries including Haiti,[2] Colombia[3] and Japan.[4] Plan International also sponsors the Because I Am a Girl campaign, which is envisioned as a global movement to ensure girls everywhere can learn, lead, decide and thrive. Vision and mission[edit] Plan's vision is of a world in which all children realise their full potential in societies that respect people's rights and dignity. Plan’s mission is to achieve lasting improvements in the quality of life of deprived children in developing countries by: enabling deprived children, their families and their communities to meet their basic needs and to increase their ability to participate in and benefit from their societies; building relationships to increase understanding and unity among peoples of different cultures and countries; and promoting the rights and interests of the world's children. Plan's work is based around 8 core areas: Education, Health, Water and sanitation, Protection, Economic security, Emergencies, Child participation, and Sexual health.[5] History[edit] Plan International's country office in Niamey, Niger Plan International was founded in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War by British journalist John Langdon-Davies and aid worker Eric Muggeridge. The organization was founded with the aim to provide food, accommodation and education to children whose lives had been disrupted by the Spanish Civil War.[citation needed] Plan is independent, with no religious, political or governmental affiliations and works in 50 developing countries across Africa, Asia and the Americas. Timeline[edit] 1930s – Plan International was founded as""Foster Parents Plan for Children in Spain."" 1940s – During World War II, the organization became known as ""Foster Parents Plan for War Children"" and worked in England, helping displaced children from all over Europe. After the war, Plan International extended aid to children in France, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, Germany, Greece and briefly in Poland, Czechoslovakia and China. 1950s – As Europe recovered, Plan International gradually moved out of these countries and opened new programs in less developed countries. It became ""Foster Parents Plan Inc."" to reflect the goal of bringing lasting change to the lives of children in need, whatever their circumstances. 1960s – Foster Parents Plan expanded its work to countries in South America and Asia. In 1962, U.S. First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy was honorary chairwoman during Plan's Silver Jubilee. 1970s – In 1974, the global name became Plan International as programs now spanned South America, Asia and Africa. 1980s – Belgium, Germany, Japan and the UK joined Canada, the US, Australia and the Netherlands as donor countries. Plan International was recognised by the United Nations Economic and Social Council. 1990s – Plan International offices opened in France, Norway, Finland, Denmark, Sweden and the Republic of Korea. 2000s – The name Plan International evolved and a unified global identity was created to help make the organization more easily recognized around the world, and the logo was updated.[citation needed] 2017 – Plan International launched a new ""International Global Strategy 2017–2022"", which places an added emphasis on working with girls. The traditional blue logo was updated.[6] Funding and accountability[edit] Plan International's income comes from supporters who sponsor children and the remainder is raised through donations and grants. An average of 77% of this money goes directly to supporting Plan International’s development and humanitarian work.[7] The remainder is spent on fundraising initiatives and maintaining an international network of support staff. Plan International publishes annual reports detailing its fundraising and spending activity.[8] The organization receives funding to implement grants from a range of multilateral institutions, such as the UK's Department for International Development (DFID), Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and other multilateral agencies.[9] Plan International adheres to several international standards and quality assurance mechanisms including the International Non-Governmental Organisations (INGO) Commitment to Accountability Charter[10] and the Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and NGOs in Disaster Relief.[11] Notable persons associated[edit] Anil Kapoor, who starred in Danny Boyle's film Slumdog Millionaire, is an ambassador for Plan India.[12] He donated his entire fee for the movie to the NGO's Universal Birth Registration campaign.[13] Slumdog Millionaire stars Dev Patel and Freida Pinto were among cast members who attended a screening of the film at Somerset House in London,[14] where over £2,000 was raised for Plan’s work in Mumbai, the setting of the film. In the U.S., notable celebrity endorsers associated with Plan International include Jacqueline Kennedy, David Elliot, Beau Bridges, Dina Eastwood, Scott Bakula,[15] and Nicholas D. Kristof, also a child sponsor.[16] In 2015 Mo'ne Davis teamed up with the brand M4D3 (Make A Difference Everyday) to design a line of sneakers for girls, with some of the proceeds going toward the Plan International’s Because I Am a Girl campaign.[17] The organization was featured in the 2002 film About Schmidt.

It is at the southwestern edge of the Greater London Urban Area and is a part of the London commuter belt, with frequent trains and a journey time of approximately 24 minutes to Waterloo station.[3] Woking is 23 miles (37 km) southwest of Charing Cross in central London. Woking town itself, excluding its narrowly contiguous built-up area which extends from West End to West Byfleet, has a population of 62,796,[4] and the UK Government has recorded its Built Up Area as 5% more populous than its borough with 105,367 residents in 2011, the highest in the county.

As a result, the original settlement 1 mile to the southeast, on the River Wey, became known as ""Old Woking"". Later, Woking Crematorium at St John's became the first crematorium in the United Kingdom.[7] Shah Jahan Mosque, the oldest in England The first purpose-built mosque in the UK, the Shah Jahan Mosque on Oriental Road, was commissioned by Shahjehan, Begum of Bhopal (1868–1901), one of the four female Muslim rulers of Bhopal who reigned between 1819 and 1926.[8] The Martinsyde aircraft company operated a major aircraft factory in the town during World War I and used nearby Brooklands Aerodrome for test flying and deliveries, but it was closed in the mid-1920s. This site was then the home of the engineering firm James Walker & Company for many years. Known as 'The Lion Works', this area was finally redeveloped in the 1990s into today's Lion Retail Park.[9] This section needs additional citations for verification.

(December 2010) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Hoe Valley Scheme[edit] This was a £40 million project to take hundreds of Woking homes away from the flood plain of the Hoe Stream. It has also provided new community facilities and roads. Woking Borough Council had been planning this scheme, which was approved in September 2010, for over 20 years. It was being run in conjunction with the Environment Agency.[10] The Council has received finance from: the Public Works Loan Board; a number of grants, including £3.7 million from the Environment Agency; proceeds from the sale of new homes and of other assets. The Council expected the scheme to be fully funded by 2014 with no ongoing costs incurred by the Council. The scheme was completed on schedule in 2012.[11] Government[edit] The constituency of Woking has historically been a Conservative safe seat, with the Liberal Democrats being the principal opposition in the last five general elections. Its current Member of Parliament is Jonathan Lord. Elections to the borough council take place in three out of every four years, with one-third elected in each election. The election in 2011 gave the Conservatives an overall majority of seats for the first time in 20 years.[12] The current Mayor of the borough is councillor Cllr Graham Cubdy.[13] In 2010 the council elected councillor Mohammed Iqbal as the first Asian Mayor of Woking.[14] The Woking Civic Offices were opened by the Duke of Gloucester in 1983.[15] Energy policy[edit] See also: Energy policy of the United Kingdom Several combined heat and power stations provide district heating and electricity, and electricity is also provided by a combination of hydrogen fuel cells and solar cells dispersed throughout the borough.[16] These are linked via an innovative private electricity distribution system operating completely off the public power grid. In order to do this, the local government laid new power lines to all locations on the Woking sustainable community energy system (due to Department of Trade and Industry regulations). Should the public power grid fail, central Woking would continue to have an energy supply.[17] The cost for providing this is approximately GB£0.01/kWh less than for public electricity. It has been reported that the borough saves GB£974,000 a year in energy costs if the installation costs are ignored.[17] By March 2004 the initiatives had also cut the borough's carbon emissions by 17.24% and those of the council by 77.4%.[18] Albion Square canopy was built in 2007, following local council approval three years earlier. It was equipped with over 35,000 photovoltaic cells laminated in 272 glass panels to collect sunlight and convert it into energy.[19] It had a peak electrical output of 81 kWp.[citation needed] It was demolished in 2018 and sold to another town. In October 2013 the council confirmed it would implement the Euro 5 environmental emissions standard for taxis and licensed vehicles in the borough, and that the more stringent Euro 6 standard would be introduced in 2022.[20] Geography[edit] Woking postal area has several villages, including: Knaphill, Horsell, Hook Heath, Mount Hermon, Barnsbury, Maybury, Sheerwater, Goldsworth Park, St John's, Pyrford, Kingfield, Westfield and Ridgway, some being contiguous which can be described now as suburbs. Further villages are: Old Woking traditionally a separate village with its own large conservation area[9][21] verging towards the Wey, Mayford; Bisley and Sutton Green to the south nearer the border between Woking and Guildford and West Byfleet to the east is a post town with Byfleet and adjoins to the north-east. Suburbs[edit] Unable to find an agent for the sale of their surplus land at Hook Heath, the London Necropolis Company themselves developed the area into a prosperous suburb of large detached houses. The Barnsbury Estate is a housing estate of approximately 400 households.[22] Begun in 1936, it is a self-contained estate of bungalows, housing and flats mostly built in the 1950s along with several small shops. Barnsbury is bordered by the Hoe Valley south of Woking straddling the A320. As part of Woking's proposed Priority Homes PFI submission, back gardens of a significant number of houses were at risk of development.[23] From January to September 2007, this resulted in an extensive community engagement to see if and how these back gardens could be used for development.[22][24] The scheme was eventually cancelled.[25] Barnsbury also has a primary school. Most of Barnsbury's students now attend the newly built Hoe Valley School for their secondary education. In the 1800s, the London Necropolis Company acquired land here on a prospective basis but built Brookwood Cemetery instead; no suitable agent of could be found to oversee the sale of the third portion of excess land at Hook Heath and as a consequence Cyril Tubbs ensured its retention and oversaw its development himself. The London Necropolis society decided to take action. Over the 1890s the site was subdivided into plots for large detached houses, and a golf course was built to attract residents and visitors.[26][a] The LNC redeveloped its lands at Hook Heath into housing and a golf course, creating a new suburb of Woking and providing a steady income from rentals. Climate[edit] Woking, along with the majority of the British Isles experiences a maritime climate, characterised by cool summers and mild winters. The nearest weather station for which data is readily available is Wisley, approximately 6 km east of Woking. Temperature extremes recorded in the area range from 37.8 °C (100.0 °F) during August 2003[29] down to −15.1 °C (4.8 °F) during January 1982.[30] The weather station also held the UK July record high of 36.5 °C (97.7 °F) from 2006 until 2015.[31] Neighbouring areas of Woking Bisley Chobham Ottershaw Brookwood Woking Pyrford Pirbright Mayford Send Demography[edit] 2001 United Kingdom census[32] Country of birth Population United Kingdom 77,577 Pakistan 1,748 Republic of Ireland 925 Italy 737 South Africa 709 India 686 Netherlands 601 Germany 590 United States 576 Australia 326 Ethnic groups[edit] Woking is a multicultural town, according to the Office for National Statistics, based on 2004 estimates, 89.5 per cent of the 62,796 inhabitants of Woking were white, with 84.15 per cent White British, 1.37 per cent White Irish and 5.76 per cent classified as Other White. Some 6.5 per cent are of South Asian descent, with Pakistanis making up 5.3 per cent of Woking's population (compared to 0.73 and 1.44 for the South East and the UK respectively), followed by Indians at 1.2 per cent. 0.50 per cent of Woking's population are Black which compares with 2.3 per cent nationally. 1.37 per cent of Woking residents are of mixed race, leaving 2.0 per cent belonging to other ethnic groups.[33] There has long been a large tightly-knit Italian community in Woking, most of whom originated from the Sicilian town of Mussomeli.[34] The majority of the original arrivals worked in the Britax factory in Byfleet. Others worked on the mushroom farms in Chobham or for the James Walker company. Many started their own landscaping or ice cream businesses. St Dunstan's Catholic Church in Woking holds masses in Italian. The Italian population in Woking, including second and third generation members, number between two and three thousand.[35] There is a large Pakistani population in Woking, centred on the suburbs of Maybury and Sheerwater,[36] near the Shah Jahan Mosque. This partly originates from workers at the then nearby Sorbo Rubber factory.[citation needed] Recently there has been an influx of eastern European immigrants, mostly from Poland.[37] Religion[edit] Religion in Woking[33] Religion Percent Christian 69.5% No religion 15.2% Religion not stated 6.9% Muslim 6.7% Other 1.6% St Mary's Church, Horsell Main article: List of places of worship in Woking (borough) The town has many churches including St Mary's Church in Horsell. St. Peter's, in Old Woking has the oldest door in Surrey. It is likely that it is the third oldest door in the British Isles after being dated by dendrochronology.[citation needed] Woking has an Islamic presence, with the Shah Jahan Mosque east of the town centre. Constructed in 1889 by Gottlieb Wilhelm Leitner, it is the first purpose-built mosque in the UK.[38] It is built in Bath and Bargate stone in indo-saracenic style commissioned by Shah Jahan, Begum of Bhopal (1868–1901), it has been maintained since then as a Waqf. Economy[edit] Woking has a modern and successful economy. The local working population is characterised by educational attainment levels well above the UK average. The number of jobs in the borough in the managerial, professional and technical sectors is around 50%, 7% above the UK average. Local Employment is largely in the private sector - Woking is one of the districts in the UK least reliant on Public Sector employment. The largest employer in Woking is the McLaren Group. The group is responsible for both McLaren Racing, which fields the McLaren Formula One racing cars (currently driven by Daniel Ricciardo and Lando Norris); and McLaren Automotive, builder of the classic McLaren F1 and Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren supercars, and now manufacturing many different high-performance sports cars.[39] During 2010 and 2011, the McLaren technology centre received a £50million extension, which was opened by David Cameron.[40] Companies with global headquarters in Woking include chemical and assembly materials company Alent plc, the UK and Ireland subsidiary of Asahi Breweries, and Ambassador Theatre Group, a major international theatre organisation. Until it was acquired by Anheuser-Busch InBev with its corporate HQ in Leuven, Belgium, the corporate HQ of multi-national SABMiller was in Woking. Asahi's presence in Woking is attributed to its taking over of some of SABMiller's former brands.[41] Woking railway station is one of the busiest commuter stations in the London commuter belt, and Woking's position along the M25 motorway facilitates commuting both into London and throughout the Home Counties. There is a large concentration of office accommodation in Woking town centre. Employers from the IT, FMCG, Engineering Services and Charities sectors are particularly well represented and provide a large number of highly skilled jobs. Significant local employers include Fidessa, Capgemini, Petrofac, John Wood, and WWF UK. Culture[edit] The Woking Martian Public art[edit] Main article: List of public art in Surrey § Woking Martian Tripod[edit] Woking has a Wellsian Martian Tripod, designed by Michael Condron, which was unveiled in April 1998. The tripod celebrates H. G. Wells's book, The War of the Worlds which was written in Woking. The Tripod is 7 m (23 ft) tall. The legs are 17 cm (7"") in diameter. There are three parts of the sculpture: The Tripod, Bacteria, and the cylinder the tripods came to Earth in. The Martian is displayed advancing from the direction of nearby Horsell Common, where the Martian invasion of Earth begins in the novel. A further tribute to Wells is a statue of him seated holding a globe by Wesley Harland. Sean Henry[edit] The Wanderer, by Sean Henry, in Albion Square In 2017, five polychrome statues by Woking born sculptor Sean Henry were displayed around the town centre as an art trail in connection with an exhibition of Henry's work at the Lightbox. In November 2017, the council announced it had agreed to buy the statues and display them in the town on a permanent basis.[42] The Wanderer can be found in Albion Square, Standing Woman in the Peacocks Centre, Standing Man in Mercia Walk, Reclining Man in Victoria Square and Seated Man on Platform 1 at Woking railway station. Bedser Bridge[edit] The footbridge over the Basingstoke Canal by the Lighthouse features statues of the cricketing brothers, Sir Alec and Eric Bedser by Allan Sly. Sir Alec is shown bowling on the south bank and Eric batting on the north bank. Others[edit] There are a number of other sculptures around the town centre, including the Winning Shot by Christine Charlesworth, celebrating the London 2012 Paralympic Games. Lightbox Art and Heritage Centre[edit] Lightbox art gallery, Woking Woking is home to an arts and heritage centre called 'The Lightbox'.[43] The modern structure, between the Basingstoke Canal and Victoria Way, was designed by architects Marks Barfield,[44] the architects of the London Eye. The Lightbox contains many hands hanging from the ceiling, a brief history of Woking and many other exhibitions. Notable past exhibitions include an exhibition of British comics and a Turner in Surrey exhibition.[45] The Lightbox also has the Ingram collection, a selection of paintings and sculptures owned by Woking Football Club owner and local businessman Chris Ingram, on a long-term loan.[46] Twin towns[edit] See also: List of twin towns and sister cities in the United Kingdom Woking is twinned with:[47] Rastatt in Baden-Württemberg, Germany[47] Amstelveen in North Holland, Netherlands[47] Le Plessis-Robinson in Hauts-de-Seine, Île-de-France, France[47][48][49] In December 2014, the council announced that it would establish a task group to explore potential twinning opportunities with the emerging markets of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.[50] Community facilities[edit] Woking has a modern shopping centre called The Peacocks and an older shopping area, Wolsey Place. The Peacocks Centre underwent development work in 2010 to add a new façade in the town square. An extension was added that consisted of adding glass with coloured lights that change in sequence.[51] The Peacocks and Wolsey Place have, at present, been joined by means of a covered walkway to complement the town centre's redevelopment. In commemoration of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee, the town square has been renamed ""Jubilee Square"". The main area for evening entertainment is around Chertsey Road which contains restaurants serving a number of cuisines such as Indian and Chinese. There are also numerous bars and pubs along Chertsey Road as well as several nightclubs around the area. Exterior of the New Victoria Theatre, Woking The New Victoria Theatre opened in 1992. Seating 1,300 people, it has hosted large-scale shows including several West End touring productions. It can be accessed via the top floor of The Peacocks. The Rhoda McGaw Theatre, a smaller 230 seat venue, is housed within the New Victoria Theatre complex. Both are owned and managed by Ambassador Theatre Group.[52] The Ambassadors Cinema, also accessed via the top floor of The Peacocks, closed in 2019[53] and re-opened as Nova Cinema in May 2021. It has seven screens, including a luxury screen.[54] Woking has an indoor swimming pool, ""Pool in the Park"",[55] and a separate leisure centre at Pool in the Park, opposite Woking Leisure Centre. Outdoor facilities include a skatepark (which is popular with local children), tennis courts, five-a-side football pitches, a cricket pitch (during the summer), bowling greens, a crazy golf course, and a children's adventure playground. These leisure facilities are in Woking Park.[56] Woking also has the largest public library in Surrey.[citation needed] Woking is also home to the Surrey History Centre, which holds archives and records about the county. In February 2021 it was reported that households in the Goldsworth Park and St Johns areas of the town would have a COVID-19 PCR test posted through their doors and be asked to complete it, regardless of whether they had symptoms or not.[57][58] Cultural references[edit] Horsell Common sandpit, site of the landing of the Martians in H.G. Wells' The War of the Worlds. In literature, Woking (or, more precisely, its suburb Horsell Common) is where the Martians first land, in a planned invasion of the earth, in the science fiction novel The War of the Worlds (1897–8).[59] The novel's author H. G. Wells was living in Woking when he wrote the book, and much of the early story is set in the area.[60] Briarbrae, the Woking home of a Foreign Office employee, Mr. Percy Phelps, is a key setting in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's 1892 Sherlock Holmes short story ""The Adventure of the Naval Treaty."" Douglas Adams defined 'Woking' in The Deeper Meaning of Liff (ptcbl. vb.), as: Standing in the kitchen wondering what you came in here for. In music, ""Town Called Malice"" was written about Woking by Paul Weller and recorded by his band The Jam. The song reached No. 1 in the UK Charts.[61] Woking station was used as the filming location for the 2014 BBC drama 'The 7.39' although there is no other connection with the town. [62] Landmarks[edit] The tallest buildings in Woking are Victoria Square Tower 1 and Tower 2 at 104 m (341 ft) and 98 m (322 ft) respectively.[63] Export House, the previous title holder, is known locally as 'The BAT Building' (Pronounced 'B-A-T'), from the initials of its first tenant, British American Tobacco.[64] It is 73 metres (240 ft) tall,[65] and has peregrine falcons nesting on top.[64] Historical monument[edit] Monument Road runs from the far end of Maybury Road to the Addlestone Road, and lies just inside the Woking side of the Woking-Sheerwater boundary. It is commonly thought to be so named because of the Muslim Burial Ground established for Muslim Indian soldiers who died in the service of the British Empire in the Great War of 1914–1918. The cemetery no longer contains graves, the corpses having been interred in the Pakistani cemetery close to the mosque, however the walls, entrance and corner towers of the cemetery still remain intact, and they bear a clearly oriental Indian style. The cemetery is set well back from the road and remained hidden until surrounding woods and shrubbery were pruned and thinned. Monument Way is probably a reference to a much earlier structure in the area that was destroyed by natural causes in the mid-1800s: ""Early in the 17th century Sir Edward Zouch obtained the Manor of Woking and gained permission to demolish the old palace site. He used some of the material to build a new house – Hoe Place (now a private school) – with some of the Tudor bricks apparently being used in buildings such as The Old House in OLD WOKING and 'The Monument' – a tower that once stood on the hill where the Hoe Bridge Golf Course is today. It was Sir Edward's grandson, Sir James Zouch, who obtained the Market Charter for Woking in 1661, with the Market House (opposite the entrance to Church Street) being built in 1665.""[66] Transport[edit] Rail[edit] Woking railway station, (south, platform 5, side) Woking railway station is on the Alton, Portsmouth, South Western and West of England Main Linea. There are frequent trains to and from London Waterloo, a journey taking approximately 25–30 minutes. There is also a twice hourly Waterloo to Woking all stations service. Gatwick Airport can be accessed via Guildford or Clapham Junction. Heathrow Airport has no direct train services from the south west of England, so a RailAir coach service operates between Woking and Heathrow. A canopy costing £2.8 million was built between the station and the main shopping area of the town. It was approximately 34 metres (112 ft) in length and 22.5 metres (74 ft) in width, stretching from the railway station entrance (town, platform 1, side) to Albion House. The project included landscaping and the provision of a new way to the town from the railway station.[67] This canopy has since been removed. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch has one of its two operational centres in Woking.[68][69] Roads[edit] Woking is accessible from the M25 motorway (junction 11), the M3 motorway (junction 3) and the A3. The main access road is the A320 between Guildford and Staines, which passes through the town centre and connects to the M25 to the north at a point close to its M3 junction, and to the A3 to the south at Guildford; further roads connect the west and east parts of the borough respectively to the M3 and A3. Bus and coach[edit] A RailAir coach service is run by National Express, connecting Woking railway station and Heathrow Airport, in the absence of a direct train link to Heathrow.[70] The bus services in Woking are mainly operated by Arriva Southern Counties, Falcon Coaches, Stagecoach South and White Bus Services.[71] Canal[edit] See also: Basingstoke Canal The Basingstoke Canal, completed in 1794, passes through the north of the town and is crossed by several footbridges and road bridges. The canal underwent restoration in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s with the restoration completed on 10 May 1991.[citation needed] River and navigation[edit] See also: River Wey and Wey and Godalming Navigations The River Wey and Wey Navigation run through the Borough of Woking Education[edit] Primary schools[edit] Infant and junior schools in the area include Barnsbury Primary School, Beaufort Primary School, Bisley C of E (Aided) Primary School, Broadmere Primary School, Goldsworth Primary School, Greenfield School, Hoe Bridge School, Horsell C of E (Aided) Junior School, Horsell Village School, ISL Surrey, Kingfield School, Knaphill Junior School, Knaphill Lower School, Maybury Primary School, New Monument Primary, Pyrford C of E (Aided) Primary School, St Dunstan's Catholic Primary School, St Hugh of Lincoln Catholic Primary School, St John's Primary School, St. Andrew's School, Sythwood Primary School, The Hermitage Junior School, The Oaktree School and Westfield Primary School.

Eighty percent of the forests that originally covered the Earth have been cleared, fragmented, or degraded as of 1997. Despite increased public awareness and conservation efforts, approximately 375 square kilometers of forest are lost everyday. Inspired by Nobel Peace Laureate Wangari Maathai, the founder of the Green Belt Movement, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) launched Plant for the Planet, a program which encourages people, communities, business and industry, civil society organizations and governments to enter tree-planting pledges online with the objective of planting at least one billion trees worldwide. In recreating lost forests and developing new ones, Plant for the Planet hopes to address other concerns including loss of biodiversity and improving water availability, stemming desertification and reducing erosion. Plant for the Planet programs have been established in Bangladesh and Ghana; it is estimated that 1 to 5 million trees will be planted in each of the participating countries by the end of 2008. In 2006, The Baum Foundation assisted Plant for the Planet in a major tree-planting event in Kenya. Through this initiative, UNEP planted 10,000 trees in schools, parks, and along main roads in Kisumu, Africa. Another 40,000 trees were also planted by schools in the area. Schools around Nairobi built upon the work done in Kisumu and planted an additional 15,000 trees. ← TUNZA Green Reach Pledge – Green Cities San Francisco America’s Ocean Challenge → View All Environment P.O.

More Products for good Our Team Get in touch Plant For The Planet Germany Our Mission Trees are the cheapest and most effective means of binding CO 2 , allowing us more time to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to zero. In Mexico, Plant-for- the-Planet plants a new tree every 15 seconds. This project demonstrates just how easy it is to make planting trees so effective on a large scale. For a donation of 1 Euro, they plant and take care of one tree. Our Story Plant-for-the-Planet started with a boy doing his homework! The children and youth initiative was launched in 2007. At the end of his school presentation, nine-year-old Felix Finkbeiner from Germany announced his vision to his classmates: “Let’s plant one million trees in every country on Earth!” In 2011, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) handed over the Billion Tree Campaign to Plant-for- the-Planet. So far, more than 63,000 children and young people have been trained as Climate Justice Ambassadors to give speeches and motivate people to plant trees. With the help of many adults, they have already planted more than 14 billion trees. Our Future The goal of the children and youth initiative Plant-for-the-Planet is to collect pledges for 1,000 billion trees by 2020. You can donate for trees on your own! Each year, one tree in average binds 10 kg CO2. By giving speeches, the children motivate governments, companies and others to plant trees. You can support the training of the children by donating for the Plant-for-the-Planet Foundation. As Felix said in his speech at the UN General Assembly: “One mosquito cannot do anything against a rhino, but a thousand mosquito can make a rhino changes its direction.” Visit our website  Copyright & Impressum Facebook Cookie Settings",Plant for the Planet Foundation

Many solutions have already been implemented across the world and can be inspirational for other regions. By making connections between concrete experiences and characterizing them through illuminating scientific works, we can promote the most suitable practices and support the choices of political decision makers and regional administrators. Download the project's presentation leaflet [CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS]What are your solutions to rising sea levels? Participate in the SEA’TIES project’s call for contributions to share your experience, illustrate the diversity of existing solutions in the world and promote your actions! All solutions will soon be available on our website! SUBMIT YOUR SOLUTION ""Assimilating scientific knowledge in a changing world, sharing solutions to cope with rising sea levels, building the cities of tomorrow while preserving the coastal and marine biodiversity on which we depend, this is the ambition of SEA'TIES"". Raphaël Cuvelier Vice-President of the OCP, President of the Steering Committee of SEA'TIES Coastal cities facing rising sea levels The city, a solutions hub The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has said that if we do not drastically reduce emissions, the level of the sea could rise about a metre by 2100 and associated extreme events could become more severe and occur more often. Such weather events will redraw the world’s coastal regions, there where most of the population lives and continues to densify. For coastal cities and their surrounding regions the challenges will be colossal. Issues such as keeping the population safe, protecting infrastructures and ports, relocating dwellings and business parks, and preserving natural areas need to be addressed in concert with all the populations and stakeholders concerned, ensuring the latter are kept informed and involved. Reconfiguring coastal cities and their surrounding regions, while taking into account social, economic and environmental issues, will give rise to crucial and complex decisions in the coming years. Any given city is, by its very nature, part of a region and often a conurbation too. It must therefore be designed and adapted in accordance with its general environment, itself a complex system.Nevertheless the way cities are managed provides a certain flexibility and independence – often much greater than for coastal megacities – and, consequently, makes them a particularly inspiring testing ground for solutions. Previous Next Cooperation, a regional challenge What are the solutions? If we are to rise to these challenges we must reinforce cooperation at every level, and in particular on the basis of scientific expertise. This requires the development of a risk culture and the deployment of considerable information and awareness-raising campaigns so that our efforts to adapt to climate change become a shared challenge. A new race against time has begun to design the coastal cities of tomorrow. We must mobilize civil society, scientists and businesses to act more alongside elected representatives and local administrators in order to tackle, together, these risks that have become very real. Sea’ties aims to deliver two types of solutions that cannot be treated separately :technical solutions, focusing directly on reducing risks (withdrawal, relocation, defensive works, solutions based on nature and ecosystems); andsolutions related to sharing knowledge and information between stakeholders, developing a risk culture through education and awareness campaigns, and regulating and financing so technical solutions can be deployed. [ADVOCACY] Lobbying national and international authorities on adaptation solutions for coastal cities Sea’ties proposals for sustainable adaptation solutions in coastal cities reach the attention of political decision makers through the policy recommendations of the Ocean and Climate Platform (OCP). Buoyed by its integration into the works of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the OCP now has the opportunity to promote solutions to all the countries and organizations concerned. Solutions that have already been deployed can now be shared and inspire other regions. Primary goals 2020-2021 >1 – Compile scientific knowledge and the data in order to produce summaries of scientific knowledge, as well as to identify and analyse the solutions deployed by coastal cities across the world. 2021-2022 >2 – Foster the emergence of “good practice” and facilitate the implementation of solutions by holding regional workshops involving scientists, elected representatives, administrators and stakeholders of coastal cities to analyse the sustainability of solutions and the conditions favourable to their implementation.> 2021-20233  – Encourage the integration of adaptation challenges into public policies by promoting real-world experience enhanced with scientific knowledge, and by submitting policy recommendations to decision makers so they can integrate the most suitable solutions into their national and international public policies. Regions involved Sea’ties focuses on coastal cities in several of the world’s regions: Europe, North and West Africa, North America (West Coast of the USA) and the South Pacific.

Les décisions de la 21e Conférence des Parties (COP) de la Convention-Cadre des Nations Unies sur les Changements Climatiques (CCNUCC) doivent absolument intégrer le rôle majeur de l’Océan dans la machine climatique et dans sa capacité à fournir des solutions aux défis climatiques de la planète.Présentation de la plateforme et de ses objectifsLancement de la plateforme (avis aux médias)L’Océan joue un rôle crucial dans la machine climatiqueCouvrant 71% de la surface du globe, l’Océan mondial, au-delà du gigantesque volume d’eau qu’il représente, est un écosystème très complexe qui fournit des services essentiels au maintien de la vie sur la Terre. Près de 25% du CO2 émis chaque année par l’Homme dans l’atmosphère est absorbé par l’Océan selon des mécanismes complexes au sein desquels le plancton joue un rôle majeur. L’Océan est également le premier fournisseur net d’oxygène de la planète, jouant un rôle encore plus important que les forêts. L’Océan constitue donc le principal poumon de la planète et se trouve au cœur de la machine climatique planétaire.Le maintien d’écosystèmes marins « en bonne santé » est une condition indispensable à la lutte contre les changements climatiquesSi l’Océan continue à limiter le réchauffement climatique global, depuis plusieurs décennies la pression anthropique, principalement les émissions de CO2, la surexploitation des ressources et les pollutions, ont dégradé considérablement les écosystèmes marins. L’Océan joue de moins en moins son rôle de régulateur du climat. L’acidification des océans, en particulier, provoque dans beaucoup de régions océaniques, une baisse de l’absorption de CO2. Pour le climat, il est donc urgent de maintenir la qualité des écosystèmes marins et de restaurer ceux qui se dégradent. Il faut intégrer l’Océan dans les discussions et les décisions de la 21e COP ClimatLes discussions sur le climat, depuis les débuts de la CCNUCC en 1992, ont avant tout été centrées sur l’engagement des États à réduire les émissions terrestres de CO2  dues à l’homme. Les questions liées au rôle des forêts dans le captage du CO2, et surtout les défis et les mesures d’adaptation au changement climatique sont venus progressivement compléter les sujets de négociations. Mais curieusement, jusqu’ici, l’Océan a été absent des enjeux, défis et solutions négociés dans le cadre des discussions de la CCNUCC. Intégrer l’Océan au cœur des négociations et de la préparation de la 21e Conférence des Parties de la CCNUCC apparaît aujourd’hui comme une évidence. Nous sommes convaincus que l’Océan est une formidable opportunité pour relever les défis de l’atténuation et de l’adaptation aux changements climatiques. L’état des connaissances scientifiques du rôle de l’Océan dans la machine climatique, la maîtrise des solutions et des contributions positives que l’Océan peut apporter aux défis du changement climatique, sont autant d’arguments pour nourrir les débats et les décisions des négociations sur le climat.Des solutions existent pour renforcer le rôle des océans dans l’atténuation et l’adaptation au changement climatiqueDe nombreuses solutions ont déjà apporté la preuve qu’il est possible de rétablir la biodiversité et de préserver les fonctionnalités écologiques des écosystèmes et services liés à l’océan, en particulier dans le domaine du climat.  La création d’un réseau d’aires marines protégées représentatif et distribué de manière cohérente ou la restauration des zones d’herbiers, des mangroves et des zones de marais littoraux en sont quelques exemples. Mais l’océan, en plus d’être un puits de carbone est une source de développement d’activités permettant la diminution des émissions de gaz à effet de serre, dans les domaines de l’énergie, du transport, de l’alimentation comme, par exemple par le développement des énergies marines renouvelables.Retour en haut de la page Plus d'information Présentation des objectifs Lancement de la plateforme (avis aux médias)Liste complète des membres  Site internet officielMembres fondateurs Agence Française des Aires Marines Protégées Association Innovations Bleues Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS) Comité français de l’Union Internationale pour la Conservation de la Nature Green Cross France et Territoires Institut du Développement Durable et Relations Internationales Fondation Prince Albert II de Monaco Institut Océanographique - Fondation Albert Ier Prince de Monaco Nausicaá-Centre National de la Mer North Atlantic Salmon Fund (NASF) NASF The Pew Charitable Trusts Réseau MEDPAN Réseau Océan Mondial Surfrider Foundation Europe Tara ExpeditionsIOC-UNESCO Informations généralesUNESCOConférence généraleConseil exécutifSecrétariat Hors siège Communautés EvènementsNous rejoindreEt aussiPatrimoine mondialEauChangement climatique Post-CriseJeunesseRessourcesConventions & recommandationsDocumentsStatistiquesLibrairieMédiasNom et logoViolation des droits de l’homme Conditions d’utilisationContactsPlan© UNESCO 2017",Plateforme Océan et Climat

103,"Océan pour le climat – Une alliance d’une soixantaine d'organisations impliquées contre le changement climatique Aller au contenu principal Océan pour le climat Une alliance d’une soixantaine d'organisations impliquées contre le changement climatique Descendre au contenu Articles Publié le 12 juillet 202111 juillet 2021Géo-ingénierie de l’océan: nouvelle frontière des débats scientifiques, politiques et éthiques dans la lutte contre le changement climatique Crédits Photo: Tom Fisk Face à l’ampleur des changements globaux, la géo-ingénierie explore des solutions technologiques pour contrer les effets de la crise climatique. Alors qu’elle n’intéressait qu’une poignée de scientifiques il y a quelques années encore, elle reçoit aujourd’hui une attention notable au sein des communautés scientifiques et politiques. À l’image du Groupe d’expert Intergouvernemental sur l’Evolution du Climat (GIEC), dont certains des scénarios, présentant un faible accroissement des émissions de gaz à effet de serre et des températures reposent largement sur des technologies de géo-ingénierie d’élimination du carbone de l’atmosphère (1). Pour autant, le recours à ces techniques est encore loin de faire l’unanimité au sein de la communauté scientifique. Les options technologiques proposées suscitent en effet de nombreux questionnements quant à leur efficacité et aux risques environnementaux associés, en plus de nombreux débats éthiques et politiques autour des cadres et limites à définir. Les contours de la géo-ingénierie La géo-ingénierie est la manipulation volontaire à grande échelle, voire planétaire, de processus géologiques, géochimiques et climatiques visant à modifier les conditions environnementales. Son objectif principal est d’atténuer les causes ou de compenser les effets du changement climatique. Dans ce contexte, certains scientifiques voient dans l’océan un réservoir de “solutions technologiques” pour faire face aux changements globaux. Il existe plusieurs types de géo-ingénierie marines qui peuvent être regroupés en deux grandes catégories : les techniques qui visent à réduire l’excès de gaz à effet de serre dans l’atmosphère et l’océan, et freiner l’acidification de l’océan, ainsi que celles qui tentent de rafraîchir la surface de la terre. Les techniques visant à réduire l’excès de gaz à effet de serre dans l’atmosphère Une technique proposée par le GIEC pour atteindre les objectifs climatiques de 1,5 à 2°C de réchauffement (2) consiste à capter le carbone directement dans l’atmosphère puis à le stocker dans le sous-sol océanique. Les roches basaltiques du fond de l’océan pourraient ainsi servir de lieux de stockage du carbone. Cette méthode nommée le Direct Air Capture with Carbon Storage (DACCS) est déjà déployée par certaines sociétés telles que l’entreprise Suisse ClimeWorks dont l’un des principaux partenaires, Northern Lights, explore des pistes de stockage offshore à 2 600 mètres de profondeur dans la mer du Nord. Cependant, ces techniques sont extrêmement coûteuses et nécessitent un apport en énergie considérable. La Bioénergie avec Captage et Stockage du Carbone (BECCS) a pour objectif de créer de l’énergie tout en stockant du carbone. Cette dernière repose sur la culture de macro-algues, qui par le processus de photosynthèse fixerait le CO2 présent dans l’atmosphère et le stockerait sous forme de molécules carbonées. Cette énergie pourrait ensuite être extraite de la biomasse par combustion, fermentation, pyrolyse ou d’autres méthodes de conversion puis utilisée sous forme de biocarburant. Le carbone en excès serait quant à lui stocké dans les formations géologiques des fonds marins. Une autre méthode de “fertilisation de l’océan” vise à stimuler la photosynthèse du phytoplancton comme voie de séquestration du carbone. Comme les macro-algues, le phytoplancton présent dans l’océan agit comme une véritable pompe biologique à carbone. Le dioxyde de carbone capté produit de la matière organique qui est ensuite consommée par de nombreuses espèces au travers des réseaux de la chaîne alimentaire. La fertilisation océanique consisterait alors à ajouter des nutriments tels que le fer dans les régions océaniques où cet élément est déficitaire comme l’océan austral afin d’accroître la capacité du phytoplancton à fixer le CO2 et donc à augmenter le potentiel séquestration de l’océan. L’Organisation Maritime Internationale a interdit l’utilisation commerciale de cette technique, estimant qu’elle présenterait un risque pour l’environnement. Quant aux méthodes d’alcalinisation de l’océan, elles se présentent comme des solutions techniques au phénomène d’acidification de l’océan. L’augmentation des concentrations en CO2 dans l’eau altère les concentrations en ions carbonate et le pH de l’eau de mer; on observe alors une acidification de l’océan. L’alcalinisation de l’eau de mer consisterait à ajouter des substances alcalines naturelles (roches carbonatées ou silicatées broyées, telles que l’olivine ou le basalte) ou artificielles (chaux), afin d’inverser le processus d’acidification et d’augmenter les capacités d’absorption du CO2 de l’océan (3). Les techniques visant à refroidir la surface terrestre Enfin, l’ensemencement de la haute atmosphère par des aérosols générés à partir d’eau salée consiste à augmenter le pouvoir réfléchissant des nuages (albedo). Cet effet miroir renverrait plus intensément le rayonnement solaire vers l’espace, permettant alors de limiter l’accumulation de chaleur à la surface de la planète (4). Cette méthode prétend répondre ainsi au problème de la hausse des températures à la surface de la terre et dans l’océan. Un intérêt croissant pour la géo-ingénierie dans les cercles scientifiques et politiques À l’heure où les États s’engagent à limiter le réchauffement climatique à un niveau inférieur à 1,5°C – 2°C par rapport au niveau préindustriel et à atteindre des émissions de carbone nulles d’ici 2050, la géo-ingénierie peut apparaître comme une solution attrayante. Le cinquième rapport du GIEC, tout en montrant qu’il est possible d’atteindre les objectifs d’émissions par des politiques ambitieuses et en pointant les limites des méthodes de retrait direct du carbone, intègre l’utilisation éventuelle de techniques telles que les BECCS dans plusieurs de ses scénarios (5). Des études sur le potentiel de la capture du carbone par les BECCS ont estimé qu’elles pourraient soustraire jusqu’à 12 gigatonnes de carbone par an de l’atmosphère (6). Pour donner un ordre de grandeur, la pandémie de COVID-19 et le ralentissement consécutif des activités humaines mondiales n’a engendré qu’une réduction de 7% (estimation haute) des émissions de carbone en 2020 par rapport à 2019, soit une diminution de 2,5 gigatonnes (7, 8). Cette diminution des émissions est en-deçà des objectifs proposés par le Programme des Nations Unies pour l’Environnement (PNUE) de réduire les émissions de 7,6 % chaque année pour ne pas dépasser les 1,5-2°C de réchauffement. Les perspectives mises en avant par la géo-ingénierie ont donc de quoi séduire certains acteurs politiques et économiques soucieux de maintenir une activité économique génératrice de profits ou de trouver des solutions rapides aux changements dans l’atmosphère et l’océan. À l’image du gouvernement australien qui, face au phénomène de blanchissement des coraux de la Grande Barrière de Corail provoqué par les vagues de chaleurs océaniques, a décidé de déployer des techniques d’ensemencement des nuages (9). Crédits Photo: Quang Nguyen Vinh Cet engouement ne se limite pas aux frontières de la politique. Si les scientifiques qui travaillaient sur le sujet étaient jusque-là minoritaires, ils sont de plus en plus nombreux à s’y intéresser et à mettre en exergue le potentiel d’émissions négatives (10). Certes, la communauté scientifique reste largement divisée sur le sujet, mais face à l’urgence, certains – tout en reconnaissant les risques de la géo-ingénierie – appellent à approfondir et soutenir la recherche dans ce domaine afin de considérer toutes les possibilités pour réduire les émissions de GES. Incertitudes et vigilance de la communauté scientifique concernant les effets sur l’environnement, les écosystèmes et la biodiversité Un tel engouement ne peut se faire au détriment d’une certaine vigilance quant aux potentiels impacts environnementaux de la géo-ingénierie. Un principe de précaution s’impose face à l’incertitude des scientifiques concernant son efficacité et ses impacts sur le changement climatique et la biodiversité. D’une part, la recherche en géo-ingénierie utilise le plus souvent des modèles qui n’ont jamais été confrontés à la réalité du terrain. Bien que l’usage de simulations à partir de modèles soit de plus en plus commun dans l’anticipation du risque, les résultats produits ne reflètent pas toujours la réalité et ils doivent être, dans tous les cas, confrontés aux observations pour être validés ou améliorés (11). Comme le souligne Nadine Lebris, Professeure Titulaire à l’Université Pierre et Marie Curie, “C’est précisément sur ce point que le manque de connaissances est le plus critique; si les observations en milieu océanique se développent rapidement, elles ne couvrent encore qu’une part limitée de l’océan et sont impactées par la variabilité, dans l’eau et sur les fonds”. Une fois mis en œuvre, cela suppose également une gestion qui anticipe les risques tout en s’adaptant aux potentielles conséquences irréversibles. À ce jour, le niveau de connaissance des mécanismes et les technologies de modélisation ne répondent pas à de telles exigences. À ce titre, Corinne Copin, Conseillère scientifique Océan à l’Institut Océanographique, Fondation Albert Ier, Prince de Monaco, avertit: “Si on s’applique à intervenir à un endroit pour capturer le carbone ou alcaliniser l’océan, on pourrait modifier les équilibres que l’on croyait acquis et perdre connaissance de notre environnement et de sa capacité à réagir”. D’autre part, les solutions proposées par la géo-ingénierie se confrontent souvent à des problèmes de faisabilité et d’efficacité technique. C’est le cas de l’alcalinisation qui requiert des moyens importants en infrastructure afin de pouvoir produire, traiter et distribuer les substances alcalines à grande échelle (12). Il en est de même pour le DACCS qui, en plus d’être extrêmement coûteux, nécessite un apport énergétique considérable (13). Enfin, les doutes persistent quant aux conséquences de certaines méthodes sur le climat et la biodiversité . Les options de séquestration de carbone utilisent les mêmes techniques qui contribuent au changement climatique et à la dégradation des écosystèmes marins, tels que l’exploitation minière et l’extraction de ressources. Dans le cas de la création de bioénergie (BECCS), la culture des macro-algues demanderait l’utilisation de méthodes de l’agriculture intensive pour pouvoir être déployées à grande échelle. Il en est de même pour la fertilisation océanique. Des expériences de grande ampleur ont ainsi démontré qu’une introduction artificielle de fer n’améliorait pas autant qu’on pouvait l’espérer la capacité de captation du carbone par le phytoplancton (14). Or, une trop grande quantité de fer introduite artificiellement dans l’océan pourrait aussi perturber la photosynthèse, elle-même responsable de la séquestration du carbone (14). Parallèlement, la forte production de matière organique induite par l’ajout de fer pourrait aussi favoriser la production de méthane et d’oxyde nitreux dont les pouvoirs réchauffant sont supérieurs à celui du CO2 (15). À court terme, s’ajoute le risque que le carbone séquestré retourne dans l’atmosphère si cette technique n’est pas réalisée de manière continue. La fertilisation océanique présente donc des risques importants en termes de rejets de GES auxquels s’ajoutent de probables effets indésirables sur les écosystèmes et la biodiversité marine. Aucune étude scientifique ne permet actuellement d’anticiper les effets écologiques de la fertilisation. Cependant, les activités anthropiques ont déjà montré des effets en chaîne inattendus et dommageables pour les écosystèmes marins et pour les sociétés qui en dépendent. Pour ce qui est des solutions technologiques d’ensemencement des nuages par l’eau salée, elles peuvent avoir des conséquences météorologiques imprévisibles localement et régionalement. Les modifications des précipitations seraient susceptibles de provoquer des sécheresses ou des inondations ; ainsi que des altérations des conditions de la vie des écosystèmes marins et côtiers (16). À l’heure actuelle, il n’existe aucune approche de géo-ingénierie répondant à la fois à des critères d’efficacité, de sécurité environnementale et d’accessibilité financière. “La géo-ingénierie marine ne s’attaque qu’aux symptômes du changement climatique et non pas à ses causes” conclut Françoise Gaill, Vice-Présidente de la Plateforme Océan & Climat et Directrice de recherche émérite au CNRS Pire encore, elles pourraient avoir l’effet inverse des résultats attendus en entraînant une augmentation des émissions de gaz à effet de serre et par conséquent la bonne santé des écosystèmes marins. Le réchauffement qui aurait alors pu être évité se décalerait dans le temps avec des conséquences beaucoup plus graves. Il est d’autant plus difficile de véritablement anticiper ces effets que la compréhension des changements climatique et océanique auxquels elles prétendent répondre est incomplète. L’incertitude concernant les impacts des différentes méthodes de géo-ingénierie marine souligne l’importance de développer la recherche publique, indépendante des intérêts économiques de certains acteurs privés. Pour Didier Gascuel, Professeur en écologie marine et Directeur du Pôle halieutique, mer et littoral à l’Institut Agro de Rennes, “Dans un monde parfait, on ne ferait de la recherche ni sur les fossiles combustibles, ni sur la géo-ingénierie. Mais, comme la recherche privée sur ces méthodes se développe, il faut une recherche publique qui regarde les impacts de ces technologies sur la biodiversité, chose que les investisseurs ne font pas forcément.” Une régulation rendue nécessaire par les enjeux éthiques et politiques À ce jour, aucun traité international n’a été signé concernant la géo-ingénierie marine. Si l’Organisation Maritime Internationale a interdit l’utilisation commerciale de la fertilisation océanique en 2010, et que certains pays tels que la Suisse tentent d’impulser les négociations, aucun accord n’a été trouvé. En 2019, au cours de la quatrième Assemblée Générale des Nations Unies pour l’Environnement, la résolution sur l’évaluation de l’état des technologies de géo-ingénierie et des preuves scientifiques ainsi que des outils de gouvernance actuels et potentiels n’a trouvé aucun consensus (17). Pourtant cette gouvernance apparaît nécessaire au regard des débats éthiques et politiques sur la géo-ingénierie. Le premier impératif de cette gouvernance concerne le contrôle des dérives et la coordination des actions individuelles et/ou unilatérales. En 2011, au large des îles Haida Gwaii en Colombie Britannique, l’entrepreneur Russ George et sa société Planktos Inc. ont clandestinement déversé plus de 100 tonnes de sulfate et d’oxyde de fer. Souhaitant tester l’efficacité de la fertilisation à séquestrer du CO2 et ainsi accumuler des crédits carbone, la démarche de cette entreprise s’inscrit dans une logique d’exploitation financière. Ce cas est emblématique des potentielles dérives qui peuvent émerger à l’avenir (18). De telles méthodes pourraient encourager des États ou des particuliers à agir unilatéralement, sans considérer sérieusement les effets pervers sur le climat et la biodiversité à l’échelle mondiale. Or, si ces actions sont isolées et menées à l’échelle locale, les conséquences concernent le niveau global et mettent en exergue des intérêts divergents. Ainsi, des dissensions apparaissent déjà entre les pays. Un second débat éthique s’articule autour des principaux promoteurs de la géo-ingénierie. En effet, les plus gros investisseurs dans ces techniques sont également les plus grands pollueurs (notamment les industries fossiles). Si la géo-ingénierie est envisagée comme une alternative à la réduction des émissions de GES, elle attire de fait des acteurs publics et privés réticents à réduire leur impact environnemental (19). Cette logique détourne l’attention et les investissements politiques, financiers et scientifiques nécessaires à la réduction des émissions de gaz à effet de serre. Pourtant la recherche sur les conséquences de ces méthodes doit jouer un rôle fondamental dans l’aiguillage des décisions car comme l’indique Laurent Bopp, Directeur de recherche au Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et de l’Environnement (LSCE), CNRS, “Il y a une vingtaine d’années, la proposition de recourir à la fertilisation par le fer a suscité beaucoup de débats dans la communauté scientifique académique. Fallait-il travailler sur cette méthode, sur son efficacité potentielle et sur ses limites ? Ou le simple fait de se pencher sur cette méthode allait-il la légitimer malgré le scepticisme initial ? Avec le recul, je crois que nous avons eu collectivement raison d’explorer, avec les outils dont nous disposions à l’époque, l’efficacité et les impacts de la fertilisation. Nous avons pu montrer sa faible efficacité, mais aussi les effets collatéraux potentiels, dommageables pour les écosystèmes et les services écosystémiques océaniques. Ces résultats ont conduit à des recommandations claires de la part des scientifiques – la fertilisation par le fer n’est pas une solution à envisager pour atténuer le changement climatique. » Un autre enjeu de justice environnementale émerge autour des inégalités nord-sud. Les techniques de géo-ingénierie marine s’appuient sur des moyens scientifiques, technologiques et financiers importants susceptibles de creuser l’écart entre les pays. Si la géo-ingénierie doit se développer, elle impose alors davantage de réflexion sur le partage des connaissances, des technologies et de la coopération entre les pays développés et en développement (20). La recherche et le développement éventuel de la géo-ingénierie doit donc s’accompagner d’une gouvernance internationale capable de faire émerger le multilatéralisme et de valoriser la science pour accompagner la décision. Selon Marie-Alexandrine Sicre, Directrice de Recherche au CNRS, ancienne présidente du Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR) “Les questions de gouvernance en géo-ingénierie marine pourraient se discuter dans un cadre onusien” Des pistes de réflexion sont déjà développées à l’interface entre la science et le politique. C’est le cas de la classification développée par Gattuso et al. (2021) sur les différentes méthodes de géo-ingénierie. Cette classification tient compte de 1) l’efficacité à augmenter l’absorption nette de carbone, de 2) l’efficacité à réduire le réchauffement des océans, l’acidification des océans et le changement climatique, 3) la faisabilité, couvrant à la fois l’état de préparation technologique et le délai jusqu’à la pleine efficacité potentielle, 4) la durée des effets, 5) le rapport coût-efficacité, 6) les co-bénéfices, 7) les désavantages et 8) la gouvernabilité du point de vue international. Ce cadre pourrait être utilisé dans le cas de la géo-ingénierie afin de prioriser certaines techniques et d’en écarter définitivement d’autres (12). Dans tous les cas, le développement des techniques retenues devra être précédé et accompagné d’une évaluation scientifique rigoureuse des impacts écologiques et environnementaux. La géo-ingénierie se présente donc comme une solution imparfaite face aux enjeux du changement climatique, qui ne remplace en rien l’urgente nécessité d’une réduction à la source des émissions de CO2 et dont l’exploration nécessite des cadres réglementaires. Si certaines de ces approches peuvent apporter des solutions techniques pour atténuer l’augmentation des GES et des températures, l’incertitude scientifique sur les effets néfastes appelle à la vigilance et à la précaution. À cet effet, des réflexions sur les cadres éthiques et réglementaires encadrant sa mise en œuvre doivent être mises en place afin d’anticiper et contrôler son développement. Cette réflexion doit s’appuyer sur davantage de recherche scientifique concernant les effets environnementaux des méthodes de géo-ingénierie marine. Crédits Photo: JAY PARK Parallèlement à la géo-ingénierie, la communauté scientifique s’accorde sur l’intérêt des solutions fondées sur la nature, aussi appelées solutions de bio-ingénierie. La protection d’écosystèmes tels que les mangroves, les herbiers marins, les forêts de macroalgues et les zones humides, véritables puits de carbone, pourrait ainsi éviter l’émission de jusqu’à 1.38 milliards de tonnes de CO2 par an (21). Les bénéfices environnementaux et socio-économiques engendrés par ces écosystèmes font de leur conservation et de leur restauration la priorité de nombreux scientifiques, permettant à la fois de satisfaire aux exigences climatiques et de biodiversité (22). Bien que ces solutions aient des effets moins rapides que ceux estimés pour les méthodes de géo-ingénierie, investir prioritairement dans les écosystèmes côtiers et marins, tout en explorant les énergies renouvelables qui nous permettront d’arriver à une économie bas carbone reste la solution la plus durable pour contrer les effets du changement climatique.

Publié le 30 avril 202101 mai 2021Les défis des énergies marines renouvelables dans le contexte du changement climatique et de l’érosion de la biodiversité Crédits Photo : Xavier Boinet La Commission européenne a dévoilé fin novembre 2020 sa Stratégie pour les Énergies Marines Renouvelables (EMR). Rappelant son ambition, inscrite dans le Green Deal, de baisse des émissions de gaz à effet de serre de 55%, la Commission souligne le vaste potentiel de l’Union Européenne pour favoriser une montée en puissance des EMR. Elle espère ainsi parvenir à une production électrique de 60GW d’ici 2030 et de 300 GW en 2050 alors que seuls 12 GW proviennent aujourd’hui de ces mêmes énergies. Cette multiplication par 30 du potentiel européen d’ici 2050 est à la fois une ambition industrielle et de transition coûteuse – chiffrée à environ 800 milliards d’euros d’investissements (1) – mais également un véritable défi environnemental pour des pays comme la France dans le cadre de l’urgente action climatique et de l’érosion de la biodiversité. Le retard français malgré un potentiel offshore conséquent Si la première ferme éolienne offshore mondiale fut installée à Vindeby au large de la côte ouest du Danemark en 1991, ce n’est que récemment que l’énergie offshore est devenue aussi compétitive, et quelquefois moins chère, que les technologies reposant sur les énergies fossiles. Le potentiel des EMR provient notamment de la diversité des sources de production énergétique exploitables. Ainsi, le terme d’énergies marines renouvelables inclue l’éolien offshore, l’énergie marémotrice, l’énergie houlomotrice, l’énergie thermique des mers, l’énergie osmotique, les installations photovoltaïques flottantes ou encore les bio-carburants algaux. Cette diversité des potentielles sources de production fait de la France, forte du premier espace maritime mondial, un territoire propice au développement des EMR. Elle dispose en effet du second gisement hydrolien en Europe (2). De plus, le récent progrès technique a permis une rapide décrue des coûts de production tandis que l’ensemble de la filière des EMR a participé d’un accroissement de l’emploi, rassemblant aujourd’hui quelques 15 000 emplois directs et indirects en France (3). Les EMR incarnent donc un potentiel levier de transition vecteur de croissance stratégique. Pourtant, la France accuse un retard sur ses voisins comme l’Allemagne et le Royaume-Uni disposant de plus grands parcs éoliens offshore. Surtout, elle ne remplira pas les objectifs qu’elle s’est fixée, à l’image de l’atteinte de 23% de sources renouvelables dans sa consommation finale brute d’énergie en 2020 (4). En 2019, ce pourcentage était de seulement 17,2 % sachant que les EMR ne sont pas la source prégnante de renouvelable, largement dominé par l’hydraulique et le bois. Les défis industriels d’une production électrique offshore décarbonée Le défi des énergies marines renouvelables est donc d’abord un défi industriel. En effet, elles sont aujourd’hui à différents stades de maturité. Si les turbines fixées jouissent d’une avance technologique conséquente, progressivement de grandes fermes commerciales flottantes se développent. Elles permettent notamment de s’affranchir des contraintes de profondeur d’eau. En France, les premières mises en services de fermes flottantes pilotes auront lieu en 2021. L’un des principaux avantages de l’éolien marin réside dans sa capacité de production presque deux fois supérieure à l’éolien terrestre à puissance égale (5). A l’échelle régionale, l’Union européenne bénéficie d’un véritable leadership technique en la matière puisque 93% des installations offshore installées en 2019 étaient produites en Europe (6). L’industrie européenne est non seulement à la pointe concernant la technologie émergeante des éoliennes flottantes mais aussi pour les technologies houlomotrices et marémotrices. Il revient donc à la France de s’appuyer sur cet avantage comparatif pour exploiter au mieux son potentiel en la matière. Tablant sur ce fort potentiel offshore en raison de sa très large ZEE et de ses différents bassins et façades grâce à ses territoires ultramarins, la France a donc inscrit dans sa programmation pluriannuelle de l’énergie son ambition de parvenir à 3000 MW installés d’éolien en mer au 31 décembre 2023, contre 440 MW à la même date pour les autres sources d’énergies marines renouvelables (7). Pour ce faire, l’Etat soutient la filière à travers la recherche, la démonstration de briques technologiques et l’implantation de fermes pré-commerciales. Le développement des EMR doit contribuer à la stabilité et l’autonomie de la grille énergétique française et européenne tout en décarbonant la production d’énergie. La Ministre de la Mer a récemment affiché l’ambition de parvenir à 25% de la production d’électricité française en offshore d’ici 2050 (8). Les progrès techniques entrevus permettent d’expliquer une baisse du coût global de la production éolienne offshore, atteignant en Europe 45-79 euros le MWh en 2019. Selon la Commission européenne, l’offshore dépasse de loin les énergies conventionnelles en termes de valeur ajoutée, de productivité du travail, de croissance de l’emploi et peut contribuer à la stabilisation du PIB européen (9). Son déploiement nécessite d’être pensé au-delà des frontières nationales et passera par une étroite coopération régionale concernant les infrastructures. En revanche, un certain nombre de questions techniques restent en suspens, à l’image de l’estimation du potentiel réel des EMR. Tout d’abord, ce potentiel est variable en fonction des bassins et de leurs vents, courants et marées. L’énergie éolienne semble à ce titre la plus versatile. De plus, il est difficilement estimable alors que potentiel naturel et potentiel techniquement/commercialement exploitable sont souvent confondus. A titre d’exemple, l’ADEME estime le potentiel français d’éolien posé à 90 GW alors qu’il serait de 16 GW en raison de la concurrence des autres usages de la mer. Concernant l’éolien flottant, l’ADEME estime que son potentiel serait de 155 GW mais, tenant compte des autres usagers de la mer, il serait plus réalistiquement de 33 GW. En revanche, ce potentiel n’est pas estimé pour l’énergie houlomotrice, marémotrice et thermique des mers malgré un véritable potentiel naturel français et des compétences technologiques pionnières à l’image de l’usine de la Rance pour l’énergie marémotrice. Enfin, la France dispose de courants particulièrement puissants qui pourraient permettre une exploitation de 3 à 5GW d’énergie hydrolienne (10). Une vigilance nécessaire concernant les impacts environnementaux Un tel développement rapide des EMR ne peut toutefois se faire se faire sans considérer leurs impacts environnementaux, les différents usages de la mer adjacents et certaines incertitudes. Malgré les bénéfices indubitables à l’échelle globale du développement des énergies marines renouvelables, leur implantation nécessite à l’échelle locale une vigilance environnementale. C’est pourquoi, la Commission européenne insiste sur la nécessité de prendre en compte leur impact environnemental durant la phase d’implantation. En France, la planification devrait donc considérer le maximum de paramètres environnementaux et permettre un état des lieux détaillé de la situation initiale des sites choisis pour l’implantation de projets. Tenir compte de l’impact environnemental des EMR dans le milieu marin pose actuellement plusieurs questions que la précaution incite à considérer. Quel sera l’impact sur le milieu de l’implantation de structures artificielles ? De quels types de pollutions seront-elles sources ? Dans quelle mesure ces pollutions affecteront la vie alentour ? La pertinence de ces interrogations est d’autant plus forte qu’elle est actuelle alors que l’implantation d’éoliennes offshore a suscité de nombreuses critiques motivées par des inquiétudes environnementales en Normandie et que l’on envisage progressivement de réaliser de tels ouvrages au sein même de parcs naturels marins. La phase d’implantation est source d’une pollution sonore conséquente nuisant principalement aux mammifères marins et aux poissons. Certaines espèces ne disposent pas des facultés d’adaptation nécessaire à ce bruit sous-marin pouvant conduire à des décès, des déplacements, des pertes d’appareils auditifs quelquefois irréversibles chez les mammifères (11). Toutefois, des solutions techniques se développent à l’image de rideaux de bulle déployés autour de la zone en travaux. Les invertébrés stationnaires restent particulièrement sensibles à ce bruit sous-marin. Il est également nécessaire de prendre en compte la fragilité des habitats lors de la pose des câbles électriques sous-marins ainsi que les saisons pour limiter l’impact écologique. Si la phase d’implantation semble la plus problématique, à plus long terme les installations offshore s’avèrent aussi sources de champs électromagnétiques pouvant perturber les espèces marines dans leur orientation et leurs déplacements. Elles constituent en outre un risque d’effet barrière en milieu sous-marin pouvant engendrer des collisions entre les mammifères marins et les dispositifs immergés (12). La réflexion sur l’impact de la production électrique offshore doit enfin considérer le cycle de vie global des installations afin de ne pas tomber dans le même écueil que le nucléaire. A ce titre, le démantèlement devra prendre en compte le milieu marin avoisinant et permettre de le restituer dans état similaire à son état initial. En outre, si la majeure partie des éoliennes parvenues en fin de vie est aujourd’hui recyclable, les pâles constituent encore le principal enjeu pour atteindre le 100% recyclable. En effet, leur durée de vie est extrêmement limitée – d’autant plus en offshore en raison de la forte érosion – et il ne semble pas encore exister de solutions viables pour leur recyclage malgré diverses initiatives européennes naissantes. De véritables progrès vers une économie circulaire sont donc attendus afin d’éviter l’apparition de cimetières de pales comme aux Etats-Unis. Cependant, il serait inexact de réduire l’impact environnemental du développement des EMR à des effets néfastes puisque l’on manque encore de connaissances sur les facultés d’adaptation des écosystèmes à ces implantations. Certains chercheurs ont pu mettre en exergue un effet récif consistant en la fixation d’une forte biomasse et l’agrégation de diverses espèces autour des structures dures d’origines humaines telles que les socles éoliens (13). La recherche a aussi montré un effet réserve, par exemple s’il est impossible de pêcher entre des éoliennes, entraînant un report des espèces s’y protégeant, pouvant ensuite avoir des effets bénéfiques sur la pêche à proximité ou les aires marines protégées à travers des effets de débordement et d’ensemencement. La France dispose de la plus grande zone économique exclusive au monde et du deuxième gisement éolien en mer en Europe, faisant des EMR un véritable levier de transition nécessaire pour respecter ses engagements internationaux de neutralité carbone à l’horizon 2050. Repenser l’apport des énergies renouvelables dans le mix énergétique grâce à l’océan implique également de repenser la consommation d’énergie pour aller vers plus de sobriété dans un monde aux ressources finies. De par le caractère novateur de ces technologies, il semble nécessaire d’être particulièrement vigilant au regard des risques environnementaux et implications pour les autres usagers de la mer. Un cadre règlementaire développé et appliqué, ainsi que le recours au principe de précaution sont des conditions fondamentales pour un développement durable des énergies marines renouvelables. Gauthier Carle, Plateforme Océan & Climat. Publié le 12 mars 202115 mars 2021Décret d’application de la loi ASAP : l’inquiétude d’ONG du Comité France Océan Crédits photo : Mélanie BAHUON / Neutral_Grey / saif images Début 2021, le projet de décret d’application de la loi d’accélération et de simplification de l’action publique (loi ASAP) a été soumis à la consultation du public et notamment du Conseil National de la Mer et des Littoraux. Celui-ci fait craindre des régressions et un démantèlement du droit de l’environnement en faveur de préoccupations économiques courts-termistes, et au détriment de la biodiversité dans le contexte de la crise écologique. En effet, il prévoit la simplification de certaines procédures environnementales applicables aux entreprises, à rebours des engagements politiques vis-à-vis de la Convention Citoyenne pour le Climat et des inquiétudes qu’ONG et juristes avaient déjà exprimées lors de la promulgation de la loi. Une restriction rétrograde du champ des enquêtes publiques obligatoires Ce décret restreindra gravement le champ des enquêtes publiques obligatoires en donnant au préfet la possibilité de recourir à une consultation électronique du public ou à une enquête publique de 15 jours, en lieu et place d’une véritable enquête publique, pour les projets relevant d’une autorisation environnementale mais n’étant pas soumis à évaluation environnementale. Ne seront ainsi soumis à enquête publique que les projets pour lesquels le préfet estime, en se basant essentiellement sur les données fournies par le porteur du projet, « qu’une enquête publique doit être organisée, en fonction de ses impacts sur l’environnement ainsi que des enjeux socio-économiques qui s’y attachent ou de ses impacts sur l’aménagement du territoire. ». Par conséquent, le préfet, disposera d’une latitude inédite lorsqu’il choisira la mise en place ou non d’une enquête publique sur un projet. Ce choix sera en outre exempt de tout contradictoire, le préfet se basant uniquement sur les documents remis par le porteur du projet. La Commission Nationale des Commissaires Enquêteurs avait déjà souligné le recul que représente la restriction des enquêtes publiques induite par le décret, suivie plus récemment par la Commission Nationale du Débat Public et l’Autorité environnementale. Restreindre la participation directe du public sur des projets d’aménagement, parmi lesquels les champs éoliens ou les carrières, risque de conduire à une augmentation forte des contentieux, produisant un effet contraire à l’objectif de simplification et d’accélération de l’action publique de la loi ASAP. L’enquête publique, conduite par un commissaire enquêteur indépendant, représente pourtant une étape déterminante dans la compréhension des enjeux d’un projet par le public. Elle a lieu préalablement à la décision et aboutit sur un rapport émis par la commission d’enquête, lequel conclut par un avis favorable, favorable avec réserve ou défavorable. Ce rapport est ensuite inclus dans le dossier soumis à l’administration en charge de l’autorisation. Il s’agit donc d’une véritable aide à la décision favorisant la participation des citoyens et pouvant incarner un garde-fou lorsqu’un projet, semble inadapté aux spécificités locales, ici environnementales. Un assouplissement des normes applicables aux installations classées La seconde disposition inquiétante en matière environnementale concerne l’assouplissement des normes applicables en matière d’installations classées. Ce sont des installations susceptibles d’engendrer des risques, pollutions et nuisances, à l’image des sites SEVESO dont on connait les risques environnementaux et sanitaires. Ainsi, le décret d’application rend optionnel, pour les projets d’installations classées, la saisine pour avis du Conseil départemental de l’environnement et des risques sanitaires et technologiques ou de la Commission départementale de la nature des sites et des paysages par le préfet. Cela concernerait également certains projets éoliens ou miniers, ce alors que la transition écologique et énergétique ne saurait avoir lieu sans tenir rigoureusement compte de son impact sur la biodiversité et les écosystèmes. De plus, le décret permet de démarrer la construction de projets d’installations classées en cours d’instruction, soit avant la décision finale de l’administration quant à la délivrance – ou non – de l’autorisation environnementale nécessaire. En d’autres termes, la construction d’un projet dont les impacts sur l’environnement sont inconnus pourra débuter, et ce au risque de voir finalement sa demande d’autorisation refusée en raison de l’importance desdits impacts. Dans la lignée des inquiétudes ayant émergé sur la loi ASAP, ce projet de décret d’application fait craindre un véritable recul des droits à l’information et à la participation des citoyens ainsi que des risques d’affaiblissement du droit de l’environnement concernant les projets d’artificialisation des espaces naturels. Un tel détricotage du droit semble d’autant plus préoccupant alors que la France poursuit l’objectif de zéro artificialisation nette et qu’il est urgent de reconsidérer l’impact des activités anthropiques sur la biodiversité dans le contexte du changement climatique. Face à ce risque d’affaiblissement de la démocratie environnementale, les suites données par le Gouvernement à la consultation du public organisée sur son projet de décret seront attentivement suivies.

Quels impacts sur les écosystèmes et les populations ? Quelles solutions mettre en œuvre pour y remédier ? Pour répondre à ces questions et aborder le champ des solutions, nous avons interviewé quatre experts et scientifiques: Didier Gascuel, Professeur en écologie marine à l’Agrocampus Ouest Rennes, et membre du Comité Scientifique de la Plateforme Océan et Climat, Philippe Cury, Directeur de Recherche à l’IRD, et membre du Comité d’experts de la Plateforme Océan et Climat, Rohan Currey, Directeur Scientifique pour le Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) et Rebecca Hubbard, Directrice des programmes chez Our Fish. La pêche est un enjeu socio-économique, pourtant, les stocks s’effondrent et les captures mondiales ne cessent de diminuer depuis quelques décennies. Quelles sont les raisons de ce phénomène ? Didier Gascuel : C’est la surexploitation des ressources naturelles qui explique la régression des captures à l’échelle mondiale. Au cours du 20e siècle, la pêche s’est intensifiée dans des proportions vertigineuses, notamment avec le développement des grandes flottilles de pêche industrielles encouragé par tous les Etats de la planète au lendemain de la seconde guerre mondiale. Dans un premier temps les captures ont augmenté, mais progressivement l’abondance des poissons dans la mer diminuait. Et lorsque cette diminution des ressources naturelles est devenue trop importante, alors les captures ont diminué à leur tour. On est entré dans la dynamique de la surpêche, cette situation absurde où des bateaux de plus en plus nombreux et de plus en plus gros capturent de moins en moins, parce que la mer a déjà été vidée d’une partie de ses poissons. Il est alors très difficile de revenir en arrière, car face à la pénurie chacun cherche à augmenter ses moyens de capture… ce qui contribue à dégrader encore plus la situation. Celle des populations de poissons et celle des pêcheurs eux-mêmes, sans parler des dégâts causés à l’échelle des écosystèmes. La pêche est aujourd’hui la première source d’impact sur la biodiversité marine. Face à ces situations de surpêche, de nombreux pays ont mis en place des mesures de gestion. L’Europe s’est notamment dotée d’une politique commune de la pêche. Ces politiques sont-elles inopérantes ? A l’inverse, est-il possible de stopper la spirale du déclin et d’inverser la tendance ? Didier Gascuel : Oui, nous en avons aujourd’hui la preuve : le déclin n’est pas fatal. Depuis une dizaine d’années, l’Europe a enfin commencé à mettre en œuvre une gestion des pêches plus efficace, notamment en fixant des quotas de pêche plus rigoureux, qui respectent mieux les avis des scientifiques. Et les résultats ont été spectaculaires. Dans les eaux de l’Atlantique, la pression de pêche a été divisée par presque deux, et l’abondance des grandes populations de poissons a augmenté de près de 50%. On partait cependant de tellement bas que la situation reste encore préoccupante. Aucune amélioration n’est observée en Méditerranée où, faute de quotas de pêche, la surexploitation est généralisée. Et surtout, les mesures prises sont très en retard sur les nécessités du moment. On s’appuie encore sur des approches dites monospécifiques, sans tenir compte ni des interactions entre espèces, ni des impacts sur les habitats marins. Face aux enjeux du changement climatique, il devient urgent de raisonner à l’échelle des écosystèmes, de rehausser toutes les normes environnementales pour reconstruire des écosystèmes marins sains, productifs et résilients. En agriculture on parle de plus en plus d’agroécologie. En mer, il nous faut inventer la “pêchécologie”. Les impacts du changement climatique sur les ressources marines sont de plus en plus visibles et préoccupants. De quels impacts parle-t-on ? Quelles sont les principales conséquences sur les populations de poisson et les sociétés qui en dépendent ? Philippe Cury : Les océans captent 90% de l’énergie solaire et se réchauffent rapidement malgré leurs tailles. La Méditerranée a ainsi vu sa température moyenne augmenter de 1,5°C en moins d’un siècle avec l’apparition de nouvelles espèces tropicales comme les barracudas, poissons lion, tétraodons, etc. Le fonctionnement et la productivité des écosystèmes sont profondément modifiés. Couplé à la surexploitation, le réchauffement provoque l’installation durable d’espèces comme les méduses ou d’autres espèces à cycles de vie courts (poulpes, calamars, …). Les habitats marins se transforment et obligent les poissons à se déplacer vers les pôles (le GIEC a estimé cette vitesse de déplacement à 72km par décennie). Les événements extrêmes éliminent les espèces animales et végétales incapables de migrer comme les coraux, les mollusques benthiques, les posidonies ou les laminaires. Les pays de la zone intertropicale, tributaire des ressources marines pour leur alimentation, sont déjà les grands perdants en voyant leurs pêcheries diminuer voire disparaître. Alors que certains écosystèmes situés aux pôles deviendraient plus productifs en poisson, la productivité mondiale pourrait cependant diminuer de 25% en 2100, mettant en péril la sécurité alimentaire mondiale. L’objectif mondial d’assurer 30% de réserves marines pleinement protégées permettra de lutter contre la perte de biodiversité mais également d’atténuer le changement climatique de multiples façons en permettant, entre autres, la captation du carbone par des populations marines plus abondantes et en protégeant les domaines côtiers des érosions. La surpêche à l’échelle globale est très préoccupante puisque plus d’un tiers des stocks de poissons marins sont exploités à un niveau biologiquement non durable. Cette situation est-elle similaire aux quatre coins du globe ? Rohan Currey : Environ un tiers des stocks de poissons dans le monde sont surexploités. Ce chiffre ne cesse d’augmenter chaque année, nous montrant à quel point il est important d’agir. En effet, il existe des disparités à travers le monde. Par exemple, en Europe, environ 40% des stocks halieutiques de l’Atlantique sont toujours surexploités, et ce chiffre s’élève à plus de 75% pour les populations de poissons méditerranéens. La bonne nouvelle est que, dans plusieurs régions, cette tendance est clairement à la baisse car de plus en plus de populations de poissons sont pêchées de manière durable. Cela illustre parfaitement qu’avec une gestion efficace fondée sur les connaissances scientifiques, nous pouvons améliorer la situation. Étant donné que les impacts du changement climatique entraînent des altérations dans la répartition des poissons, il est plus que jamais essentiel d’établir une coopération plus forte entre les gouvernements afin de garantir collectivement qu’il y aura suffisamment de poissons pour les générations futures. Quelles solutions pouvons-nous penser pour soutenir la transition de la pêche vers des pratiques durables? Rohan Currey : Nous pouvons tous jouer un rôle dans l’accompagnement du secteur de la pêche dans une transition vers des pratiques plus durables. Travailler à la durabilité est un long processus et ne peut être accompli par les pêcheurs seuls. Unir leurs forces avec les gestionnaires, les gouvernements, les scientifiques, les ONG et même les acteurs du marché peut accélérer considérablement le processus. À ce jour, plus de 430 pêcheries ont franchi le pas pour obtenir une certification durable et plus de 100 Projets d’Amélioration des Pêcheries (FIP) ont été développés, confirmant ainsi que la transition est en cours. Les consommateurs et les citoyens ont également un rôle important à jouer. En choisissant des produits de la mer certifiés durables, ils envoient un signal fort à l’ensemble de la filière: ils récompensent les pêcheurs qui ont fait les efforts pour opérer durablement, ils incitent les autres à faire les changements nécessaires dans leurs pratiques, et ils poussent les distributeurs et les marques à adapter leurs politiques d’approvisionnement afin de proposer des options plus respectueuses de l’environnement. En travaillant ensemble, nous réussirons beaucoup mieux à surmonter le défi de la surpêche. Comment la société civile peut-elle faire pression sur les décideurs politiques pour favoriser une meilleure gouvernance de la pêche ? Rebecca Hubbard : La société civile doit rappeler aux décideurs qu’un océan sain est essentiel à la bonne santé des humains, et que la surpêche a un impact majeur sur la biodiversité des océans. Les pratiques de pêche doivent être soumises à des évaluations d’impact sur les écosystèmes comme toutes autres activités humaines – ces impacts recoupent ceux sur les réseaux trophiques, les espèces protégées, les habitats, la séquestration du carbone et la capacité d’adaptation au climat. Une première étape simple (déjà inscrite dans le droit de l’Union européenne !) consiste à mettre fin à la surpêche destructrice – ceci permettra d’accroître les populations de poissons et de garantir les emplois, mais aussi d’améliorer la santé des océans et leur capacité à réguler le climat. De même, les subventions qui exacerbent la surpêche, telles que les subventions fiscales sur les carburants, devraient être supprimées – car lorsque nous sommes confrontés à une crise climatique, personne ne devrait être payé pour polluer. Au niveau européen, quelles mesures immédiates les décideurs peuvent-ils mettre en œuvre afin de mettre fin à la surpêche ? Rebecca Hubbard : L’Union européenne a fait quelques progrès afin de mettre fin à la surpêche, mais les mesures sont trop peu nombreuses et le processus trop lent, si bien que la santé des mers de l’espace européen est encore préoccupante. Les nouvelles promesses politiques pour freiner le changement climatique et protéger la biodiversité sont positives, mais ils est urgent de mettre en place dès maintenant certaines mesures : fixer des limites de pêche annuelles conformes aux avis scientifiques ; introduire une obligation à l’évaluation d’impact de la pêche sur les écosystèmes et le climat (par le biais d’un nouveau plan d’action de la Stratégie pour la Biodiversité pour la protection des écosystèmes marins); et supprimer les subventions fiscales sur les carburants en révisant la Directive de l’Union européenne sur la Taxation de l’Énergie.

Propos recueillis par Anaïs Deprez et Sarah Palazot Publié le 21 décembre 202002 janvier 2021Cap sur la COP26 : le « Dialogue Océan et Climat » s’installe peu à peu au sein de la Convention Climat Quelques jours avant la rencontre des « leaders du Climat » à Londres le 12 décembre, un nouveau chapitre s’est ouvert pour l’Océan. Plus discret, le Conseil scientifique et technologique subsidiaire (SBSTA) de la Convention Climat (CCNUCC) a réuni les Etats-Parties, les scientifiques et les experts de la société civile pour le premier Dialogue Océan et Climat. Mandaté à l’issue de la COP25, ce conseil s’est spécialement réuni pour renforcer les actions d’atténuation et d’adaptation en lien avec l’océan et le climat. Loreley Picourt, Secrétaire Générale de la Plateforme Océan & Climat, qui a participé à cette rencontre, décrypte cette phase préparatoire qui tend à officialiser la place de l’océan dans la convention alors qu’une possible remobilisation des Etats se dessine. A moins d’un an de la COP26, les Etats « leaders du climat » viennent de se réunir à Londres. En quoi consistait ce sommet du 12 décembre ? Loreley Picourt – L’objectif du sommet de Londres était surtout de rassembler les pays les plus ambitieux. L’ordre du jour était donc surtout à la remobilisation des Etats, à la relance des processus politiques pour remobiliser les plus grands pollueurs. C’est une façon de redynamiser les discussions après le report des grands événements internationaux du fait de la crise sanitaire mondiale. Certains pays dont les engagements n’ont pas été jugés suffisants n’ont tout simplement pas été autorisés à s’exprimer. L’Australie ou le Brésil mais aussi la Russie, la Turquie ou encore l’Arabie saoudite n’ont pas eu voix au chapitre. C’est une façon intéressante de procéder. De cette manière, le Royaume Uni, qui prendra la présidence de la COP26, a en quelque sorte donné le ton. La date symbolique du 12 décembre, cinquième anniversaire de l’Accord de Paris, venait aussi rappeler à la communauté internationale l’urgence de retrouver “l’esprit de Paris”. Tous les pays n’ont pas déclaré, en 2020 comme prévu, leurs contributions nationales à la lutte contre le changement climatique. De nouvelles annonces ont-elles été faites lors de ce sommet ? LP – La question centrale était bien sûr celle de la réduction des émissions de gaz à effets de serre pour limiter le réchauffement de la planète à 2°C d’ici 2100. Mais on ne peut pas parler de grande annonce en tant que telle. L’Union Européenne a rappelé son objectif de réduire de 55% ses GES d’ici 2030 et la Chine a redit qu’elle s’engageait à la neutralité carbone d’ici 2060, se contraignant à réduire son intensité carbone de plus de 65% d’ici 2030. Reste à définir une feuille de route pour savoir dans quels secteurs les pays devront agir, concrètement. En tout, 75 pays ont pris la parole, parmi lesquels 45 ont précisé chacun leurs contributions nationales (NDC). Mais le chemin à parcourir entre les annonces et les mesures réelles et concrètes sera encore long. La manière d’y parvenir concrètement reste au cœur du problème. Dans ce contexte de remobilisation, l’océan bénéficie-t-il, lui aussi, d’une plus grande attention ? LP – Oui mais de façon très marginale, sans grande surprise. Et il ne faut pas perdre de vue que les efforts de réduction des émissions de GES doivent rester au centre des préoccupations, car c’est bien la première des mesures qui permettra à l’océan de continuer à nous rendre autant de services, de limiter son réchauffement, son acidification et l’érosion de sa biodiversité. Dans un registre très technique de la Convention Climat, oui on peut dire que les choses avancent pour l’Océan. Lors du « Dialogue Océan et Climat » qui s’est tenu les 2 et 3 décembre, le conseil scientifique et technologique, qui est un organe subsidiaire de la Conférence des Parties de la CCNUCC (ndlr Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice – SBSTA), les pays et les experts se sont consacrés uniquement aux interactions océan et climat. C’est une première. Le rôle du SBSTA est de conseiller en amont des COP sur les questions scientifiques, technologiques et méthodologiques. Cette phase préparatoire avait été décidée à l’issue de la Blue COP (COP25). Elle est très technique certes, mais c’est une avancée plutôt positive car elle présente l’avantage de rendre la question de plus en plus officielle au sein de la Convention Climat. L’Océan prend peu à peu sa place. Nous sommes passés des « discussions de couloirs »  aux « travaux de coulisses », qui sont très peu relayés ou expliqués car ils sont en marge des négociations à proprement parler. Plus concrètement, de quoi ce conseil a-t-il traité ? LP – Avec les scientifiques et les techniciens de la Convention Climat, les pays se sont penchés sur la meilleure manière de prendre en compte ce duo Océan et Climat. Leur objectif, était de se concerter sur la meilleure façon de renforcer, au sein de la CCNUCC, les actions qui permettent à la fois d’atténuer le changement climatique grâce à des solutions marines ou océaniques et de s’adapter aux bouleversements que l’on observe ou peut anticiper. Ces discussions feront l’objet d’une restitution à la COP26, où l’on espère voir émerger des suites concrètes. Les mesures, elles, se traduiront demain dans les solutions plus concrètes comme l’adaptation à l’élévation du niveau de la mer, le développement d’éoliennes en mer, la réduction du CO2 des transports maritimes, l’aménagement des ports mais aussi par le déploiement de solutions fondées sur la nature qui apportent des bénéfices importants, comme la restauration des mangroves, la préservation de zones marines très productives ou très fragiles. Dans ce travail de cadrage, un nouveau point d’attention est apparu : il concerne la manière de rendre cohérents les travaux et de créer des ponts entre les conventions Onusiennes. L’écosystème marin est un véritable trait d’union, il ne peut être pris en compte ni sans sa biodiversité, ni sans son rôle climatique, c’est un tout. Comment la science est-elle mobilisée dans ces travaux du SEBSTA ? LP – Aujourd’hui, dans ces discussions, la place de la science est devenue absolument centrale. De manière unanime, tous pensent que la connaissance scientifique permet d’être plus efficace, de mieux comprendre et répondre aux urgences, de préserver, d’anticiper davantage. Mais la connaissance doit progresser encore car nous sommes loin de tout savoir sur l’Océan et son avenir. Par exemple, nous savons très peu de chose sur la pompe à carbone, son fonctionnement, sa capacité demain à stocker le CO2 excédentaire… Avec ce type de conseil, la communauté scientifique diffuse une connaissance et une culture de l’océan parmi les décideurs. Dans les antichambres, l’océan fait petit à petit sa place dans les esprits. Certains pays apparaissent-ils comme des leaders pour l’océan au sein de la Convention Climat ? LP – Globalement et logiquement, les pays les plus mobilisés sont ceux du Pacifique ou de l’Amérique Latine où la biodiversité marine est importante. Le Chili, les Seychelles, les îles Fidji, et d’autres pays insulaires du Pacifique – en sont le symbole pour qui l’élévation du niveau de la mer est une réalité particulièrement menaçante. Dans ces pays, les impacts économiques et humains sont très lourds. Le Costa Rica lui aussi est très présent sur ces questions et intervient davantage en termes de solutions, comme la restauration des mangroves, mais pas seulement. Enfin, Monaco reste un leader historique. En Europe, c’est l’Espagne, et de manière croissante la France, qui tentent de dynamiser la politique des 27. Le Royaume-Uni souhaite également porter l’océan, et la Nature plus généralement, au cœur de ses priorités climatiques. Savez-vous d’ores et déjà ce que la COP26 pourrait apporter en faveur de l’océan ? LP – Le Royaume Uni aura beaucoup à prouver lors de la COP26, post-Brexit, et en tant que pays maritime, il a le potentiel d’assumer une présidence décisive pour les enjeux océan-climat. Au sein de la Plateforme Océan & Climat nous serons attentifs à une meilleure coordination et coopération entre les différents programmes onusiens, et particulièrement entre la Convention Biodiversité (CDB) et le futur Traité sur la Haute Mer (BBNJ). On encouragera les solutions fondées sur la nature, et autres mesures relatives à l’océan comme les énergies marines renouvelables et la transition du secteur maritime, dans les stratégies d’atténuation et d’adaptation des pays. Et enfin, il faut avancer pour que le Fonds vert et les différents mécanismes de financement soient fléchés davantage vers les « mesures bleues ». Il faut innover, il y a de nouvelles ressources financières et de nouveaux acteurs dont ceux du secteur privé qui peuvent intervenir pour accélérer la transition vers la neutralité carbone. La façon dont les pays porteront également ces recommandations sera prochainement discutée lors du Sommet de l’ambition pour l’océan et le climat, les 26 et 27 janvier.

Publié le 14 janvier 202114 janvier 2021Le changement climatique bouleverse les écosystèmes marins : Vélocité climatique et migration marine L’océan absorbe plus de 90 % de l’excédent de chaleur induit par les activités humaines[i]. L’augmentation de température qui en résulte se fait ensuite ressentir jusqu’à des profondeurs de plus de 2 000 m. Les conditions de vie des espèces sont alors modifiées et entrainent un déplacement de leurs aires de répartition conduisant à une redistribution spatiale de la biodiversité marine à l’échelle planétaire[ii]. Pour tenter de mieux appréhender ces déplacements, une nouvelle approche se développe : la mesure de la vélocité climatique. Celle-ci cherche à estimer l’exposition potentielle au changement climatique d’une ou de plusieurs espèces d’un espace donné, en estimant la distance qu’elles ont à parcourir pour conserver des conditions climatiques stables dans le temps. Cette étude pourra aider à mieux appréhender les bouleversements de l’océan induits par le changement climatique et ses conséquences pour les écosystèmes et nos sociétés. Vivre dans un espace en trois dimensions Si l’océan limite en partie le changement climatique, les changements globaux issus des émissions de CO2 des activités humaines accentuent déjà la vulnérabilité de ses écosystèmes avec un effet considérable sur les aires de répartitions des espèces marines[iii]. Selon une étude récente, les espèces marines se déplaceraient vers le pôle six fois plus rapidement que les espèces terrestres[iv]. Cette vitesse de migration suggère que la redistribution des espèces aura de plus grandes conséquences dans l’océan que sur terre si les écosystèmes et nos sociétés ne s’adaptent pas assez vite. Alors que notre attention est souvent focalisée sur les changements physiques de l’océan, le développement de certaines populations dans des espaces qu’elles n’occupaient pas avant entraine déjà des réorganisations sur le long terme au sein des communautés marines. Ces changements dans la répartition géographique de la biodiversité peuvent s’accompagner d’une perte de diversité génétique ou fonctionnelle via la fragmentation ou la réduction des habitats, c’est-à-dire la perte de certains génomes ou de certaines fonctions essentielles au bon fonctionnement des populations et des écosystèmes. Les changements de répartition pourraient aussi conduire à l’émergence de nouvelles communautés marines. Certaines prévisions annoncent que les prochaines décennies verront des changements conséquents s’opérer dans la composition des communautés arctiques, de certaines régions tempérées comme la mer du Nord, des tropiques et de l’océan Austral[v]. En cause, des espèces opportunistes à grande capacité d’adaptation se chargeront d’occuper la plupart des habitats disponibles au détriment d’espèces plus sensibles au changement climatique[vi]. De plus, si les 200 premiers mètres de la colonne d’eau sont bien documentés, en dessous de ce seuil les changements des conditions de vie des espèces des grands fonds, leurs limites physiologiques et les effets du changement climatique sur les interactions trophiques (le long de la chaine alimentaire) sont moins bien connus. Les conséquences du réchauffement sur ces milieux demeurent incertaines, mais risquent d’être plus importantes que prévues[vii]. Comme le suggèrent des études récentes[viii], les déplacements des espèces d’eaux profondes pourraient être plus importants que ceux des espèces en surface. Même si la vitesse du réchauffement en eau profonde est moindre que celle observée en surface, le fait que ces habitats aient généralement des températures très stables, aussi bien dans le temps que sur de très grandes distances, les rend plus sensibles aux changements climatiques. Quels enjeux pour la biodiversité marine mondiale ? Face à ces changements d’envergures, les individus d’une espèce ont plusieurs façons de réagir : s’adapter aux nouvelles conditions de vie dans leur aire de répartition actuelle ou se déplacer vers de nouvelles airesgéographiques pour trouver des conditions climatiques plus favorables. Le succès de la reproduction d’une espèce est fortement lié à son environnement. Les nouvelles conditions qui émergent en un lieu donné favorisent certaines espèces qui voient leur population augmenter, tandis que d’autres sont défavorisées et régressent. Les changements étudiés, dont le réchauffement des eaux, entraînent alors une modification de la structure et de la diversité des communautés à l’échelle planétaire et peuvent voir émerger de nouvelles communautés d’espèces. D’un point de vue scientifique, comprendre les déplacements des populations étudiées, dans le temps et l’espace, est essentiel pour déterminer quand et où celles-ci sont ou seront exposées aux impacts du changement climatique. L’anticipation de ces impacts sur la biodiversité marine – en particulier la composition de ses communautés – est également cruciale pour comprendre la dynamique de déplacements des populations marines[ix] mais également pour réduire les menaces sur les services écosystémiques dont dépendent de nombreuses activités humaines liées à la mer, comme la pêche. Des chercheurs comme William W.L. Cheung se sont déjà intéressés aux effets du changement climatique sur le déplacement de populations d’espèces pêchées[x]. Tous reconnaissent que ces modèles s’accompagnent souvent d’un degré d’incertitude élevé[xi]. À cela s’ajoute un manque de connaissances sur la biogéographie et la biologie des espèces ne permettant pas avec certitude d’appréhender les déplacements des populations marines[xii]. Pour essayer de mieux comprendre ces déplacements, l’estimation de la vélocité climatique se développe donc depuis une dizaine d’années. Qu’est-ce que la vélocité climatique ? Le concept de vélocité climatique date de 2009[xiii] et peut être défini comme la vitesse et la direction de déplacement qu’un point doit suivre pour rester dans un espace climatique relativement similaire[xiv]. Concrètement, la vélocité permet d’estimer l’exposition potentielle au changement climatique d’une ou de plusieurs espèces d’un espace donné, en estimant la distance à parcourir pour conserver des conditions climatiques stables dans le temps. Cette vélocité est souvent appliquée à la température et se calcule comme le ratio de la vitesse d’évolution de la température (en °C/an) sur le gradient thermique horizontal maximal (en °C/km) pour obtenir le déplacement de l’espèce étudiée en km/an. En pratique, plus une zone se réchauffe rapidement, plus la vélocité climatique est élevée. Mais pour une même vitesse de réchauffement, ce sont les régions où les variations de température sont les plus faibles qui exprimeront les plus fortes vélocités climatiques. En effet, les espèces de ces milieux étant a priori moins adaptées à des changements de température conséquents, il leur faudra se déplacer sur des distances beaucoup plus grandes pour conserver des conditions thermiques inchangées. Des études récentes ont montré une très bonne corrélation entre les changements de répartition de certaines espèces marines (vitesse et direction de la migration apparente) et la vélocité climatique calculée pour les dernières décennies[xv]. L’associer à des données sur les conditions de vie des espèces étudiées pourrait ainsi permettre de prévoir la direction et la vitesse des déplacements potentiels du vivant. De plus, alors que les études précédentes basées sur la biologie des organismes se limitent à des espèces suffisamment bien étudiées et exploitées par la pêche, le principe de mesure de la vélocité climatique se veut simple et intuitif. Se basant principalement sur des données physiques, il permet alors de considérer un large éventail d’espèces marines : 12 796 dans une étude de 2015, contre 802 dans l’étude de Cheung de 2014[xvi]. De plus, cette nouvelle analyse ne se limite plus aux changements de la richesse en espèces d’un espace donné mais examine pour la première fois à l’échelle mondiale et dans le temps et l’espace l’effet du changement climatique sur la composition des communautés marines. Une limite à ce concept reliant biogéographie et climat : bien que ce nouveau modèle présente moins d’inconnues que les modèles précédents, le déplacement des populations est complexe à appréhender, il est difficile de prévoir avec précision où une espèce aura la capacité de s’installer dans le futur. Ses déplacements peuvent varier selon que la migration concerne les adultes ou la dispersion des larves, si elle peut migrer en profondeur ou pas, et ne pas aller systématiquement dans une même direction. Il est donc possible que des espèces ne parviennent pas à s’installer dans des régions où le climat leur permettrait de se développer. Malgré cela, cet outil permet déjà d’anticiper des tendances et pourrait offrir une aide à la fois à l’élaboration de mesures de conservation et au processus de décision visant ces mesures en l’informant mieux. Un outil efficace pour la conservation marine ? Les AMP sont définies par l’UICN comme « un espace géographique clairement défini, reconnu, spécialisé et géré par des moyens légaux ou d’autres moyens efficaces, visant à assurer la conservation à long terme de la nature et des services écosystémiques et valeurs culturelles qui y sont associées »[xvii]. Or, des études montrent que les délimitations géographiques des aires protégées actuelles risquent de devenir rapidement obsolètes. Selon certaines prévisions, le changement climatique entrainera le déclin des communautés de ces aires protégées, induisant leur migration vers de nouvelles zones géographiques[xviii]. Une étude montre par exemple qu’en 2100 plus d’un tiers des populations de phytoplancton tropical aura vu son aire de répartition et ses conditions de développement se déplacer vers les pôles[xix]. Si cette hypothèse se confirme, alors tout le réseau trophique lié au phytoplancton va suivre ce déplacement, migrer et potentiellement sortir des airesmarines protégées. Le défi est complexe car dans le même temps les AMP ne font pleinement sentir leurs effets, notamment en termes de restauration des habitats, que sur le moyen et long terme. Les temps de restauration des écosystèmes se chiffrent généralement en décennies. Néanmoins, la prise en compte de la vitesse climatique dans la conception des AMP pourrait permettre de mieux élaborer ces zones protégées en réfléchissant à leur taille et leur localisation afin de mieux conserver la biodiversité océanique[xx]. Ces recherches soulignent également que dans le scénario d’émission de gaz à effet de serre le plus faible du GIEC (appelé RCP2.6), les AMP ont tendance à conserver une plus grande partie de leurs conditions climatiques actuelles contrairement à des scénarios plus pessimistes[xxi]. L’océan ne connait pas de frontière Les recherches montrent que les changements de répartition des populations marines transcenderont les frontières nationales. Comme l’explique Gabriel Reygondeau, chercheur à l’Université de Colombie-Britannique (UBC), « Les poissons marins n’ont pas de passeport et ne connaissent pas les frontières politiques »[xxii]. Par conséquent, seuls la coopération et le dialogue entre les différents pays concernés par ces déplacements permettront des efforts de conservation efficaces et pragmatiques. Des actions sont déjà entreprises en ce sens, comme les négociations actuellement en cours aux Nations Unies sur la préservation de la biodiversité marine des zones ne relevant pas de la juridiction nationale[xxiii] ou l’entrée, en Janvier 2021, dans la décennie des Nations Unies pour les sciences océaniques. Qu’il s’agisse de la pêche ou de la gestion des aires marines protégées, comprendre l’influence du changement climatique sur les dynamiques des populations et des écosystèmes qui les soutiennent serait un atout majeur pour les enjeux présents et futurs. La vélocité climatique est un concept encore jeune qui reste à développer. Mais dans le contexte du changement climatique, mieux prendre en compte cette notion offre la possibilité de penser des réponses dynamiques et adaptées face aux menaces pesant sur la biodiversité marine, ses écosystèmes et ses populations.

Visité le 28/09/2020 Disponible via : https://www.un.org/bbnj/fr Publié le 07 décembre 202007 décembre 20205 ans après l’Accord de Paris : la Plateforme Océan & Climat alerte sur l’urgente adaptation à l’élévation du niveau de la mer Le 12 décembre 2015, les pays Parties à la Convention-cadre des Nations unies sur les Changements Climatiques (CCNUCC) adoptaient un accord historique. Cinq ans après l’Accord de Paris, les avancées et les perspectives ne sont pas à la hauteur des ambitions. La Plateforme Océan & Climat (POC) – qui porte la voix de près de 100 organisations dédiées à l’océan en France et à l’international – rappelle l’urgence de réduire drastiquement nos émissions de gaz à effet de serre et alerte sur l’importance de renforcer l’adaptation des littoraux à l’élévation du niveau de la mer. Notamment pour les villes côtières où la croissance démographique explose. Les impacts humains et économiques attendus à court terme sur les littoraux sont colossaux. Sans perdre de vue l’objectif primordial de la neutralité carbone, une nouvelle course contre la montre est lancée qui nécessite le renforcement des mesures d’adaptation dès la COP26. COP26 : une remobilisation possible des États grâce au leadership Europe-Chine-USA L’année 2020 devait être une étape décisive pour la mise en œuvre de l’Accord de Paris avec la révision à la hausse des engagements nationaux des États (NDC). Mais le bilan est alarmant. Les efforts restent largement insuffisants pour limiter le réchauffement à 1,5°C et atteindre la neutralité carbone en 2050. Les annonces récentes de l’Union Européenne visant à réduire de 60% ses émissions de gaz à effet de serre d’ici 2030, le retour attendu des États-Unis dans l’Accord de Paris et l’annonce de la Chine pour une neutralité carbone en 2060, font renaître l’espoir d’une nouvelle dynamique. Ils pourraient remobiliser la communauté internationale. “Cette nouvelle configuration pourrait faire de la COP26 une étape véritablement propice pour accroître les ambitions climatiques et atteindre un niveau conforme aux objectifs de l’Accord de Paris en matière d’atténuation » indique Romain Troublé, Président de la POC. Poursuivre les avancées de l’océan dans la Convention Climat Au cours de ces 5 dernières années, une série d’avancées stratégiques peuvent toutefois être soulignées. Elles ont permis d’intégrer enfin l’océan dans les discussions de la Convention “Avant 2015, parler de changement climatique sans l’océan, c’était oublier le cœur-même de la machine climatique. C’est en 2019, avec le premier rapport du GIEC consacré à l’océan et à la cryosphère (SROCC), que le consensus a été établi : les fonctions de production d’oxygène, d’absorption de la chaleur et de séquestration du carbone des écosystèmes marins font partie des solutions reconnues dans la lutte contre le changement climatique » rappelle Françoise Gaill, océanographe et vice-présidente « Science » de la Plateforme Océan & Climat. Des avancées permises notamment par un dialogue consolidé entre scientifiques et décideurs. C’est en effet à Madrid, lors de la « COP Bleue » (COP 25), que la Convention-cadre des Nations unies sur les Changements Climatiques a intégré l’océan dans la décision finale et dans ses travaux à venir. Une dynamique qui sera sans doute renforcée par le lancement de la Décennie des Nations Unies pour les sciences océaniques au service du développement durable (2021-2030). Mais ces avancées qui soulignent l’impérative préservation des écosystèmes marins, en vertu de leurs fonctions climatiques, n’auront de portée réelle que si l’on atteint les objectifs de réduction des émissions de gaz à effet de serre. Accélérer l’adaptation à l’élévation du niveau de la mer Rehausser effectivement l’ambition de réduction des émissions reste la condition fondamentale pour limiter les impacts sur l’océan et les populations qui en dépendent. Mais faute d’une réduction drastique et rapide des émissions, le niveau de la mer va continuer de monter, et pourrait s’élever de près d’un mètre d’ici 2100 selon le GIEC. Les événements extrêmes liés à l’élévation de la mer qui se produisaient environ une fois par siècle pourraient se produire au moins une fois par an [i]. D’ici 2050, plus d’un milliard d’habitants vivront sur les littoraux, dans des zones de basse altitude pouvant être submergées lorsque la mer atteint son niveau le plus haut. En France, 864 communes et 165.000 bâtiments seraient déjà menacés, selon le Ministère de la Transition écologique. A Jakarta, 40% de la capitale indonésienne se trouve déjà sous le niveau de la mer [ii], si bien que le gouvernement indonésien espère d’ici 2024 avoir relocalisé une bonne part de ses activités administratives. Au niveau mondial, les coûts s’élèveraient à 14 000 milliards de dollars par an d’ici 2100 [iii]. L’enjeu d’une adaptation rapide est donc majeur. « Ces phénomènes vont redessiner les littoraux du monde entier, là où la population est la plus dense et continue d’affluer. Dans les villes côtières et leurs territoires, les défis sont colossaux. Pour limiter les impacts humains, économiques et sociaux, il faut considérablement renforcer les mesures d’adaptation au sein des politiques territoriales, à très court terme » indique Raphaël Cuvelier, vice-président « Plaidoyer » de la POC. Favoriser les solutions inspirées de la nature Les zones humides, les mangroves, les marais salants et les prairies marines, représentent des solutions fondées sur la nature, et sont des protections naturelles, il est vital de les préserver et de les restaurer. « Toutefois, dans les territoires à forte densité, comme en Méditerranée, les ouvrages de défense devront être inspirés par la nature, telles les digues bio compatibles, pour permettre d’allier protection des sociétés humaines et des écosystèmes marins. » explique Patricia Ricard, vice-présidente « Méditerranée » de la POC. Les solutions devront être articulées entre elles et adaptées à la réalité de chaque littoral et de son milieu marin. Se concerter et développer la culture du risque Face aux enjeux socio-économiques, les responsables politiques et les gestionnaires, soucieux de protéger les habitants et d’assurer le développement des territoires, doivent aider à dépasser les blocages et les intérêts divergents. Pour la Plateforme Océan & Climat, même s’il faut parfois construire des digues, il est indispensable avant toute chose de construire un dialogue. Cela suppose d’informer et de sensibiliser, mais également de développer la culture du risque. Ces mesures doivent aujourd’hui mobiliser plus encore la société civile, les scientifiques, les entreprises aux côtés des décideurs pour, ensemble, faire face à ce risque devenu bien réel.

Publié le 08 juin 202009 juin 2020Protéger la biodiversité océanique : un rempart contre le changement climatique De nos côtes jusqu’aux profondeurs abyssales, l’océan est incontestablement le plus grand espace de vie de la planète, avec un peu moins de 280 000 espèces recensées (1). Il s’agit pourtant d’un espace qui reste largement inexploré : on estime qu’il pourrait abriter entre 500 000 et plus de 10 millions d’espèces différentes – sans même compter le monde microbien, dont le nombre d’espèces serait proche de la dizaine de milliards (2). En plus d’être un formidable réservoir de biodiversité, l’océan fournit des services essentiels au maintien de la vie sur Terre (3), notamment en matière de régulation du climat : il absorbe chaque année 30 % du CO2 émis par l’Homme dans l’atmosphère et plus de 90 % de la chaleur additionnelle due aux gaz à effet de serre. Ses fonctions de régulateur du climat sont aujourd’hui largement reconnues, fonctions qui sont essentiellement associées à des processus physico-chimiques mais aussi biologiques. Ces derniers, encore peu connus, méritent pourtant toute notre attention : les écosystèmes océaniques auront sans doute un rôle clé dans l’évolution future de puits de carbone océanique. Quels sont les liens entre biodiversité marine et régulation du climat ? Quel est l’impact des activités humaines sur les écosystèmes océaniques et leur capacité de régulation ? Quelles solutions mettre en œuvre pour y remédier sur le plan politique ?  En cette journée mondiale de l’océan, la Plateforme Océan et Climat souhaite apporter un éclairage sur la place centrale qu’occupe la biodiversité océanique dans la régulation du climat, et sur l’urgence de sa protection. Quel rôle joue la biodiversité océanique dans la régulation du climat ? L’océan est le plus grand puits naturel de carbone sur Terre et fournit, grâce à ses écosystèmes, de nombreux services d’atténuation des effets du changement climatique (4). Ces fonctions d’atténuation sont notamment permises par certaines espèces marines qui jouent un rôle clé dans le cycle du carbone naturel en séquestrant de grandes quantités de carbone dans les eaux de l’océan profond. Cette fonction de séquestration de carbone passe, pour une grande partie, par le plancton, vaste ensemble d’organismes (animaux et végétaux), souvent microscopiques, qui se développent dans tous les milieux aquatiques. Le phytoplancton (plancton végétal) capte du carbone grâce à la photosynthèse, et est ensuite ingéré par le zooplancton (plancton animal) qui s’en nourrit. Ce faisant, le CO2 de l’atmosphère dissous dans la mer et absorbé par le phytoplancton est ensuite ramené dans les profondeurs océaniques par le zooplancton. Fig.1 – L’océan, pompe à carbone biologique. Par la Plateforme Océan et Climat, Fiche pédagogique tome 2. D’autres écosystèmes dits de “carbone bleu”, comme les prairies sous-marines et les forêts de mangroves, participent également à l’atténuation du climat. Grâce à la photosynthèse, ces écosystèmes captent le gaz carbonique de l’atmosphère et piègent les sédiments dans leurs systèmes racinaires, emprisonnant ainsi le carbone (5). Par exemple, la posidonie constitue un des emblèmes du carbone bleu côtier. Très répandue, cette plante à fleurs occupe 20 à 50 % des fonds situés entre la surface et 50 mètres de profondeur. Présente sur l’ensemble du pourtour méditerranéen, elle forme des herbiers marins classés parmi les habitats naturels côtiers les plus productifs de la planète. Elle libère entre 14 et 20 litres d’oxygène par jour pour chaque m² d’herbier (6). En tenant compte de la superficie occupée par les herbiers de posidonies en Méditerranée (environ 35 000 km²), la quantité de carbone ainsi séquestrée pourrait atteindre 1.09 Tg de carbone par an (7). La posidonie va, en se développant, étendre sa surface d’échange avec l’environnement et capter davantage de gaz carbonique, mais aussi libérer plus d’oxygène dans l’atmosphère. A l’inverse, leur dégradation entraînerait une remise en circulation dans l’environnement d’une quantité non négligeable du carbone stocké depuis des années dans ces écosystèmes. En plus de ses fonctions de puits de carbone, elle constitue également une nurserie pour de nombreuses espèces marines, et participe donc directement à favoriser la reproduction et le développement de nombreux poissons. Outre l’atténuation du changement climatique, certains écosystèmes rendent des services en matière d’adaptation aux effets du changement climatique. Les récifs coralliens constituent un exemple intéressant. En effet, un récif corallien pourrait absorber jusqu’à 90 % de la force d’impact d’une vague (8). Les récifs coralliens protègent actuellement plus de 150 000 km de côtes (9), agissant comme un rempart face aux effets de l’élévation du niveau des mers, de l’érosion côtière et de la multiplication des événements extrêmes. Alors même que le dernier rapport spécial du GIEC “Océan et Cryosphère” fait état des changements observés dans l’océan et qui pourraient devenir, à une certaine échéance, irrémédiables et irréversibles (10), protéger les écosystèmes marins apparaît plus urgent que jamais dans le cadre de la lutte contre le changement climatique. Quels impacts des activités humaines sur les écosystèmes océaniques et leur capacité à réguler le climat ? A l’heure actuelle, jusqu’à 10 milliards de tonnes de gaz carbonique – liées aux énergies fossiles – sont émises chaque année dans l’atmosphère (5), affectant directement le système climatique. L’océan, sa biodiversité et le climat étant intimement liés, la concentration trop importante de gaz à effet de serre dans l’atmosphère entraîne de nombreuses conséquences : des conséquences physico-chimiques sur l’océan, mais aussi sur ses écosystèmes, et in fine sur les sociétés humaines. Fig.2 – Océan et changement climatique : panorama des conséquences. Auteurs : Corinne Bussi-Copin, Céline Liret, Emilie Etienne. Source : PLATEFORME OCEAN ET CLIMAT, 2019, Océan et Changement climatique : les nouveaux défis. Focus sur 5 grands thèmes du Rapport Spécial « Océan et Cryosphère » * L’augmentation de la concentration de gaz à effet de serre entraîne un réchauffement de l’atmosphère impactant directement l’océan, qui se réchauffe lui aussi. En effet, ce dernier a absorbé environ 150 milliards de tonnes de carbone depuis 1870 (5). Ainsi, le réchauffement du système climatique provoque l’apparition de vagues de chaleur océaniques, qui concerneraient près de 84 % de la superficie de l’océan (11). Certains organismes sont capables de se déplacer pour trouver des conditions thermiques plus adaptées, et migrent vers des eaux plus froides, entraînant des changements dans les réseaux trophiques. Une étude du CNRS a récemment démontré que les espèces marines se déplaçaient ainsi à une vitesse moyenne de plus de 6 km par an vers les pôles, contre 1 km pour les espèces terrestres (12). D’autres espèces marines, quant à elles, ne peuvent se déplacer et/ou n’ont pas le temps de s’adapter, les changements étant trop rapides. Le plancton polaire, par exemple, possède un patrimoine génétique moins flexible que celui des zones tropicales, l’exposant au risque de disparaître et d’entraîner un écosystème entier à sa suite (13). Une autre conséquence du réchauffement de l’océan est la désoxygénation, les eaux plus chaudes contenant moins d’oxygène (14). Sur les dernières décennies, les zones de minimum d’oxygène, soit les zones sous-marines où la teneur en oxygène est à son plus bas, ont augmenté de 3 à 8 %. Dans ces zones, de nombreuses espèces ne peuvent pas survivre et la désoxygénation pourrait mener à une perte de 15 % de la biomasse globale des animaux marins d’ici 2100 (10). Ces impacts observés sur la biodiversité marine et l’océan ont, à leur tour, des conséquences sur le climat. Laurent Bopp, Directeur de Recherche CNRS au Laboratoire de météorologie dynamique (LMD), Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace (IPSL), et membre du Conseil Scientifique de la Plateforme Océan et Climat, parle dans la lettre d’information n°17 de l’Institut Océanographique Paul Ricard « Le carbone bleu, souffle de l’océan » (5), d’une boucle. « Lorsque les émissions de gaz carbonique augmentent dans l’atmosphère, les puits naturels de carbone – terrestres et océaniques –, sont moins efficaces à absorber le carbone, car un océan plus chaud capte moins de gaz carbonique. Du coup, la concentration de gaz carbonique dans l’atmosphère est accélérée, donc le système climatique se réchauffe encore plus, le changement climatique s’amplifie et l’efficacité des puits naturels de carbone se réduit à nouveau… Et ainsi de suite, pour une nouvelle boucle. » Les activités anthropiques et leurs conséquences remettent donc en cause la capacité de l’océan et de sa biodiversité à accomplir leur fonction de régulateurs du climat (5). Protéger, conserver, restaurer la biodiversité : autant de solutions d’avenir pour lutter efficacement contre le changement climatique Si la réduction des émissions de gaz à effet de serre pour limiter le réchauffement en dessous des 1,5°C est aujourd’hui reconnu comme l’enjeu principal en matière de lutte contre le changement climatique, protéger les écosystèmes marins demeure essentiel pour maintenir l’équilibre du vivant et du climat. C’est dans cette perspective que la Plateforme Océan et Climat, depuis sa création à la COP21, promeut des recommandations pour un océan en bonne santé et un climat protégé. Plusieurs pistes d’action centrées sur la protection de la biodiversité sont ainsi abordées dans son plaidoyer 2019 (15), notamment : “Protéger les écosystèmes marins à forte valeur écologique et biologique, et/ou ceux qui séquestrent et stockent une grande quantité de carbone, le « carbone bleu »”. “Accélérer significativement la mise en place de mesures d’adaptation, en particulier pour les États insulaires et les régions côtières, en privilégiant les solutions fondées sur la nature.” Par exemple, dans le cadre d’une réduction des risques littoraux, réhabiliter un cordon dunaire constitue une solution fondée sur la nature permettant de prévenir du risque d’une submersion marine (16). “Créer et gérer effectivement des aires marines à protection haute et/ou intégrale”, permettant de protéger et de conserver la biodiversité océanique des pressions humaines (surpêche, chalutage de fond ou encore exploitation pétrolière et gazière) tout en renforçant la résilience au changement climatique. Afin de pouvoir mettre ces solutions en œuvre, il est essentiel de prendre en compte les liens entre l’océan, la biodiversité et le climat. La crise sanitaire que le monde traverse actuellement a décalé l’agenda international, alors que l’année 2020 devait être la “Super Year for Biodiversity”. C’est cette année que devait se tenir le Congrès mondial de la nature de l’UICN, à Marseille (France), ainsi que la COP15 de la Convention sur la Diversité Biologique (CDB) à Kunming (Chine), mais aussi la COP26 de la Convention Cadre des Nations Unies sur le Changement Climatique (CCNUCC), lors de laquelle les Etats doivent revoir à la hausse leurs engagements volontaires (NDC’s). Ce décalage crée une fenêtre d’action, dont il faut sans aucun doute tirer profit pour repenser non seulement nos systèmes de gouvernance, mais aussi notre approche sur les problématiques de protection du climat, de la biodiversité et de l’océan. Il faudrait considérer l’interdisciplinarité scientifique, mais aussi et surtout considérer un rapprochement entre les différentes conventions internationales sur le climat (CCNUCC) et la biodiversité (CDB). Pour ces raisons, la Plateforme Océan et Climat invite les Parties à la CCNUCC et à la CDB à un rapprochement entre les différentes instances de gouvernance, telles que les COP et les organes subsidiaires, et à construire des agendas d’action communs pour une gouvernance intégrée « océan-climat-biodiversité ». Une volonté politique forte est nécessaire afin de s’assurer que les solutions mises en place aient des effets positifs et durables pour l’ensemble du vivant. Plus que jamais, 2021 devra être l’année de la mobilisation générale en faveur de l’océan, du climat et de la biodiversité.

Publié le 04 juin 202004 juin 2020La Fondation Tara Océan lance une campagne « renversante » et renforce son implication dans la recherche sur le microbiome marin À l’occasion de la Journée Mondiale de l’Océan, la Fondation Tara Océan lance une campagne « renversante » et renforce son implication dans la recherche sur le microbiome marin. Cette campagne – conçue par l’agence SoixanteSeize – inverse le haut et le bas, retourne ciel et terre, invitant à « renverser la situation et à commencer à protéger l’essentiel ». Ces affiches de campagne seront visibles pendant au moins 2 semaines dans les couloirs et sur les quais de métro parisien, avec le soutien de la régie publicitaire Mediatransports pour les grandes causes environnementales et solidaires. Renverser la situation pour mettre la biodiversité et l’Océan au coeur de nos priorités « À l’image de nos vies depuis l’apparition du virus Sars-CoV-2, cette Journée Mondiale de l’Océan n’est pas celle que nous espérions », indique Romain Troublé, directeur général de la Fondation. À Lisbonne où devait avoir lieu une conférence des Nations Unies dédiée à la préservation de cet écosystème, ou à Marseille avec le Congrès Mondial de la Nature, l’Océan devait faire l’objet de toutes les attentions, au plus haut niveau des instances politiques nationales et internationales. Alors que cette mobilisation est reportée sine die, voilà qu’un virus de 0,1 micron a instauré à lui seul une mise en jachère historique des écosystèmes marins, des littoraux et des pêcheries à l’échelle planétaire. « Il faut sans doute remonter aux dernières guerres mondiales pour observer un tel impact positif sur la biodiversité marine », ajoute-t-il. « À l’aube de la mise en place d’une relance économique planétaire, cette crise nous oblige donc à réfléchir sur la façon de mettre l’Océan, et plus largement, la biodiversité au coeur de nos modèles de développement ». Ce virus, aujourd’hui sur notre route, aurait très bien pu venir de l’Océan Depuis 10 ans, la Fondation Tara Océan et les instituts de recherche associés ne cessent de découvrir de nouveaux organismes microscopiques, virus, bactéries, micro-algues et d’en étudier les interactions. En stockant du carbone, en produisant de l’oxygène, en transformant l’énergie solaire ou chimique en matière organique vitale pour toute la chaîne alimentaire marine et même pour nous, ce véritable microbiome nous rend, à chaque instant, des services inestimables. Ce « petit peuple » de l’Océan est à l’image de notre microbiote intestinal, indispensable à la vie. Mais nous le connaissons encore trop peu. « Malgré les progrès fulgurants de la science biomédicale, cette crise n’a cessé de rappeler le rôle capital de boussole que joue la recherche fondamentale et l’urgence de progresser encore plus vite dans l’avancée de nos connaissances pour nous prémunir, demain, de futures crises probables », indique Eric Karsenti, biologiste, directeur de recherche EMBL, et Médaille d’Or du CNRS. Fort de ces constats, la Fondation Tara Océan est plus mobilisée que jamais. Elle va poursuivre et renforcer son implication dans la recherche sur l’évolution du microbiome marin, sur les services vitaux qu’il nous rend et sur la façon dont ces services sont affectés par la pollution ou le réchauffement global. Dès aujourd’hui, avec les instituts scientifiques associés et ses partenaires, elle développe également ses recherches sur les liens entre l’environnement, la biodiversité avec notre santé en ligne de mire. Expertise à l’appui, la Fondation se mobilise aussi pour que la nécessaire relance économique ne soit pas le fossoyeur des récentes avancées en matière de lutte contre la pollution plastique dans l’Océan. Notre santé et celle de la biodiversité sont indissociables. En détruisant la biodiversité, nous découvrons notre fragilité. En l’étudiant et en la préservant, nous serons en mesure demain de pouvoir renverser la situation et commencer à protéger l’essentiel. Un cadre de mobilisation international pour la recherche sur l’Océan En décembre prochain, les Nations Unies lanceront la Décennie pour les sciences océaniques au service du développement durable (2021-2030). La Fondation Tara Océan s’inscrira dans cette décennie, en renforçant sa mobilisation avec la communauté scientifique, les décideurs politiques, les entreprises, et la société civile autour de la recherche océanographique. Publié le 20 avril 2020Éoliennes en mer : quel impact sur l’écosystème ? Un paradoxe pour les chercheurs Il arrive que le chercheur en écologie se trouve face à un paradoxe : ce qui est bon pour la planète, et en particulier ce qui permet de limiter les changements climatiques, peut s’avérer être en contradiction avec ce qui, localement, est bon pour la préservation de l’écosystème. Cela serait le cas, par exemple, si l’on sacrifiait une vasière dans un estuaire pour développer une plateforme de transport permettant de limiter le coût en énergie fossile. La vasière est en effet un habitat essentiel pour le développement des poissons et, autour d’eux, de tout un réseau d’interactions caractéristique des estuaires. Il est donc primordial d’avoir en tête ces deux échelles, de penser global et local à la fois. La question se pose, dans ce contexte, de l’effet de l’exploitation des énergies marines sur les écosystèmes marins. Certes, il n’est pas nécessaire de prouver l’intérêt, pour limiter le changement climatique, de développer les énergies renouvelables en mer, mais quel est l’impact local sur l’écosystème ? Crédit : Patrick Bonnor / Adobe StockLégende : la France n’a pas encore de parc éolien en phase d’exploitation, mais de tels équipements sont déjà présents dans différentes mers du monde. En mer, les écosystèmes sont d’une grande complexité. Une façon de décrire cette complexité est d’observer l’organisation des flux de matière organique liés aux relations entre un prédateur et sa proie. Il est trop simplificateur de parler de chaîne alimentaire en mer. L’écosystème repose en effet sur plusieurs sources de matière organique, comme la photosynthèse des différents végétaux, en particulier du phytoplancton (algues microscopiques), mais aussi la consommation de détritus. De plus, on observe généralement plusieurs proies par prédateur et plusieurs prédateurs par proie. Cet entrelacs de chaînes alimentaires forme le réseau trophique. Etudier cette complexité demande d’associer études de terrain et utilisation d’outils mathématiques pour l’étude des réseaux d’interactions. Cette association a donné naissance à un domaine de recherche en écologie appelé « analyse des réseaux écologiques ». Aujourd’hui, les spécialistes de ce domaine sont fortement sollicités par la société civile pour répondre à des questions concrètes telles que la définition d’indicateurs de santé de l’écosystème et de seuils d’alerte pour réagir ou la caractérisation d’impacts variés sur le fonctionnement de l’écosystème. Au travers du projet TROPHIK, ils se sont penchés sur la question de l’effet de la présence des éoliennes en mer et du changement climatique sur le réseau trophique marin (1). Le site atelier était le projet de parc éolien au large de Courseulles-sur-Mer, en baie de Seine. Effet récif vs effet réserve Lorsque l’homme immerge une structure en mer, un certain nombre d’espèces, dont l’habitat est habituellement composé de rochers, viennent s’y fixer, profitant de ce nouveau socle. Ceci va aussi attirer les prédateurs de ces espèces. Cette combinaison de processus est appelée « effet récif ». Cet effet est le principal à influencer l’organisation de l’écosystème. C’est ce qu’ont montré les modèles mathématiques simulant le réseau trophique dans 30 ans, en présence du parc éolien de Courseulles-sur-Mer (2, 3). On s’attend en effet à la fixation d’une forte biomasse de moules sur les mâts de ces éoliennes et à l’agrégation de différentes espèces telles que des poissons ou des étoiles de mer. Crédits : à gauche Thomas Pavy, à droite Brook / Adobe StockLégende : exemples d’effet récif sur des structures marines. Différentes espèces viennent se fixer sur les structures ou profiter des ressources alimentaires qui s’y sont fixées. La conséquence de l’effet récif est l’apparition d’une communauté composée d’espèces de zone rocheuse dans une zone de sédiments meubles, se traduisant par un changement profond du fonctionnement de l’écosystème. Par exemple, la consommation de détritus devient supérieure à celle du phytoplancton, provoquant une augmentation du recyclage. Le réseau trophique présente ainsi un fonctionnement nouveau, caractérisé par une forte activité due à la présence d’une forte biomasse qui consomme plus mais aussi recycle plus qu’en l’absence des éoliennes. L’apparition d’espèces nouvelles pour la zone peut aussi s’avérer problématique si ce sont des espèces invasives, susceptibles de déloger des espèces présentes à l’origine. Les modèles mathématiques appliqués ne permettent cependant pas de conclure sur ce point, à propos duquel il faudra mener des études plus poussées sur le terrain. Les modèles mathématiques ont aussi permis d’étudier le rôle que pourrait avoir l’exploitation du parc éolien sur l’écosystème par le biais d’une baisse de l’activité de pêche. C’est ce qu’on appelle « l’effet réserve ». D’un parc éolien en mer à l’autre, la gestion de la pêche est très variable et, dans le cas de Courseulles-sur-Mer, l’organisation des éoliennes a été conçue afin qu’il soit possible de pêcher entre les rangées d’éoliennes. L’effet réserve serait alors très limité. Cependant, les modèles ont été poussés à l’extrême pour étudier quelle serait la sensibilité de l’écosystème dans une situation d’un parc où la pêche aurait été fermée. Les résultats préliminaires montrent que ce choix de gestion pourrait permettre de compenser la perte de surface pêchée par un phénomène de débordement qui rendrait les zones adjacentes plus riches et plus productives. Cet effet de débordement est largement étudié autour des aires marines protégées et pourrait être bénéfique à l’écosystème aussi bien qu’aux pêcheurs si le choix d’une mise en réserve était fait dans d’autres parcs à l’avenir. Mise en place d’un atlas sur l’effet du changement climatique Dans la zone étudiée, le changement climatique a aussi un effet visible sur l’écosystème marin. Avec un changement de température de 0,5 à 1° par décennie, la Manche présente déjà une baisse de l’abondance des espèces d’eau froide et une augmentation de celles d’eau chaude (4). Les modèles mathématiques permettent de simuler l’effet du changement climatique sur la distribution de chacune des espèces (5). Un atlas a récemment été mis en place, composé de cartes de probabilité de présence des espèces de la Manche à l’horizon 2100. Pour cela, il a fallu adapter les méthodes appliquées en milieu terrestre, pour prendre en compte la variation de température en fonction de la profondeur ou le fait que la nature du substrat attire plus ou moins chaque espèce. Les cartes ainsi établies correspondent aux scénarios extrêmes de changement climatique établis par les climatologues (5). On peut voir, par exemple qu’il est probable que le tacaud disparaisse progressivement de la baie de Seine. Cet atlas est un premier pas vers une meilleure compréhension des effets du changement climatique sur le fonctionnement de l’écosystème. Il reste maintenant à intégrer ces évolutions, établies espèce par espèce, au sein du réseau trophique. On pourra ainsi voir si les effets combinés de la présence des éoliennes ont tendance à atténuer ou au contraire amplifier celui du changement climatique (6). Et après : quelles recommandations pour la suite ? Crédit : France Energies MarinesLégende : Campagne en mer pour le suivi scientifique de l’écosystème. Mise à l’eau d’un filet pour récolter le zooplancton (plancton animal). En conclusion, il apparaît que la présence des éoliennes a un effet local, lié principalement à l’effet récif, qui se traduit par l’apparition d’un nouvel écosystème, caractéristique des substrats rocheux, au milieu d’un écosystème de substrat meuble. Le changement de fonctionnement prédit par la modélisation n’est pas une dégradation mais un simple changement d’état, plutôt bénéfique à la diversité, avec des flux d’échanges qui augmentent et un recyclage plus important. Cependant, l’approche a ses limites. Une grande inconnue demeure la conséquence de la présence de ces structures sur la distribution des espèces invasives. Par ailleurs l’effet local peut aussi être lié à la mise en réserve de la zone couverte par un parc éolien et à un effet de débordement qui peut s’avérer positif non seulement sur place, mais aussi dans les zones adjacentes. On ne peut donc pas parler d’un effet local négatif, ce qui évite de se retrouver face au paradoxe soulevé plus haut. Cependant cette conclusion est à moduler, voire à remettre en cause, en fonction du site envisagé. Le développement des énergies marines ne doit pas se faire au détriment d’écosystèmes emblématiques. La planification des espaces marins doit avant tout sanctuariser les habitats essentiels.

It is a partner of the UK Research & Innovation's Natural Environment Research Council (NERC). PML's chairman is Admiral Sir James Burnell-Nugent, its chief executive is Prof. Icarus Allen and its patron is the film-maker James Cameron. Contents 1 Research and capability 2 History 3 Affiliations 4 References 5 External links Research and capability[edit] Research activity at PML broadly investigates global-scale issues of climate change and sustainability. PML's core capabilities are centred around biogeochemistry and systems science, ecosystem health and human health, and sustainable development and biodiversity. It has particular capacity around Earth observation, ecosystem modelling, microbial ecology, Blue biotechnology, socioeconomics and policy advice. The Plymouth Marine Laboratory research ship ""Plymouth Quest"" Specific research activities include the monitoring of ocean acidity and its effects on corals and shellfish, and this information is reported to the UK government. As part of its research into sustainability, PML uses technology such as photo-bioreactors to cultivate algae that could be used in the production of biofuels or in the treatment of waste water. Aside from its environmental research, PML also works alongside the Boots Group to investigate the use of algae in skin-care products, since these organisms utilise sunscreen-like compounds to protect themselves from the sun.[1] Within its Seawater Hall, PML contains an in-house, fully contained, algal scale-up pilot plant. This contains a 550L biofence photobioreactor and a 1200L raceway pond system, as well as a range of smaller bubble column reactor systems at 3.5L and 11L capacity for smaller scale algal production.[2] These facilities are regularly used to generate dried algal biomass on the scale of grams to hundreds of grams. This algal innovation centre also investigates a range of downstream processing techniques for algal harvesting. In addition to large-scale investigations, PML has a Single Cell Genomics facility: a dedicated clean room environment for single cell isolation, equipped with a high speed Atomic Force Microscope, cell-sorting flow cytometry capabilities and a number of liquid-handling machines. PML has a wholly owned trading subsidiary, PML Applications Ltd., which has been created to facilitate the exploitation and application of PML research and its products and to provide a more appropriate interface for working with end users, industrial and commercial partners.[citation needed] History[edit] The Plymouth Marine Laboratory was founded in 1988, mainly due to the recommendations of a House of Lords Report. It was formed by drawing some elements of the Laboratory of the Marine Biological Association (MBA) with the NERC Institute for Marine Environmental Research (IMER). On 1 April 2002, PML changed from being a wholly owned NERC research centre to an independent organisation with charitable status.

That is according to a new study, the first holistic assessment of marine and land-based plastic pollution in the Southern Caribbean and some of the environmental and human factors which might influence its distribution. The study is the result of sample analysis from a pioneering all-female Round the World sailing mission led by eXXpedition. Samples were collected in late 2019 from the seas and seafloor, and from land-based assessments. Off the coast of five Caribbean countries, it identified 18 different polymers of plastic – including, synthetic fibres, paint flakes and acrylics – in waters across the Caribbean, with the highest concentrations (5.09 particles per m³) located off the San Blas islands in Panama. Detailed ocean modelling and an assessment of regional policies indicated the abundance of microplastics in the area likely arose from a combination of distant sources carried by ocean currents and run-off from mainland Panama, which has some of the highest estimated levels (around 44%) of mismanaged waste in the region. By contrast, the waters off Antigua, Bonaire and Colombia had lower quantities of terrestrial and marine plastics. Antigua, in particular, had a high diversity of polymers, with the research suggesting the majority of the microplastics collected were likely to have been transported by currents generated in the wider North Atlantic Ocean, even originating in the so-called North Atlantic garbage patch. Writing in Science of the Total Environment, the study’s authors suggest both terrestrial litter and the microplastics identified in marine samples may arise from the maritime and tourism industries. That in turn, they say, represents the complex challenges of managing plastic pollution since both are major contributors to the economies of the Caribbean region. The research was led by scientists at the University of Plymouth in conjunction with the University of Georgia, Plymouth Marine Laboratory (PML) and the Technological University of Panama. Molly James, Marine Ecosystem Modeller at PML and study participant, said: ""Having followed the work of eXXpedition for a while I was excited to be asked to be involved in this project. My particular role was to use particle tracking modelling techniques to identify potential source locations of plastic fragments collected in samples taken by the eXXpedition crew. We found that ocean currents can cause transboundary movements of plastic particles within the Island groups in the Caribbean Sea which could undermine local national and national legislation aimed at reducing plastic pollution. In some cases we found that plastics found around the Caribbean Islands likely came from the wider North Atlantic Ocean. Our findings highlight the need for interdisciplinary and collaborative research and solutions to plastic pollution."" Dr Winnie Courtene-Jones, eXXpedition Science Lead and Post-Doctoral Research Fellow in the International Marine Litter Research Unit at the University of Plymouth, is the study’s lead author. She said: “Until now, evidence of the abundance of plastics within the Caribbean has been lacking. This study presents a snapshot of plastic pollution, and how it differs – in quantity, nature, origin and the policies in place to manage it – across the south of the region. It contributes towards the void of knowledge regarding marine plastic pollution in the Caribbean Sea but also highlights the need for international and interdisciplinary collaborative research and solutions to plastic pollution.” eXXpedition’s Round the World voyage left Plymouth in October 2019 to visit some of the most important and diverse marine environments on the planet with the aim of inspiring a network of changemakers, informing effective solutions with industry and influencing policy change on land. Emily Penn BEM, eXXpedition Founder and one of the co-authors on the current study, said: “Our vision for eXXpedition Round the World was to explore remote and inaccessible parts of the planet to pinpoint where the solutions to plastic pollution lie on land by better understanding the sources. The surprising thing from our discoveries is the huge diversity of polymer types which means the pollution has come from many different sources and as a result means the solutions need to be diverse too. We all share one planet and wherever we live the ocean connects us - this study demonstrates why for any game-changing action to tackle ocean plastic pollution all sectors of the community must come together in a holistic way across the Caribbean region and beyond.” Professor Richard Thompson OBE, Head of the International Marine Litter Research Unit and senior author on the study, added: “It is now very clear that plastic litter presents a global environmental problem. There are changes we can all make in our everyday lives to help address that challenge. However, it is only by gaining a better understanding of how plastic debris passes from its source to the ocean that we will be fully equipped to tackle the problem.” Share this story: Further Information'Source, sea and sink—A holistic approach to understanding plastic pollution in the Southern Caribbean' is published online now in Science of the Total Environment Find out more about exxpedition Other recent news articles News Marine science on the ice Science on ice, helicopter training, and a polar bear encounter: all in a day’s work for a Marine Chemist in the Arctic.

Point Blue's mission is to conserve birds, other wildlife and ecosystems through science, partnerships, and outreach. Their philosophy is based in part upon the notion that healthy ecosystems will continue to sustain thriving wildlife and human communities well into the future. Contents 1 Overview 2 Initiatives 3 Personnel 4 References 5 Further reading 6 External links Overview[edit] Point Blue was founded in 1965 to study bird migration along the Pacific flyway, and has the longest running population study of landbirds in North America west of the Mississippi river (continuous since 1966) located in Marin County, north of San Francisco, as well as maintaining a year-round research presence on the Farallon Islands since 1969. Point Blue is headquartered in Petaluma, California with several active field research stations and sites throughout California. Their field station in Bolinas, Ca offers environmental education, guided tours of the mist-netting process used to study birds, and seasonal interns are there all year learning about banding/studying birds. In June 2013, the organization changed its name to Point Blue Conservation Science.[2] Initiatives[edit] The organization's top priorities are to understand and project the effects of climate change and other environmental stressors on nature and wildlife in order to benefit birds, other wildlife and people.[3] In collaboration with Conserve.IO (EarthNC), Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary, Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary and Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary, Point Blue has developed the “Whale Aware” program, a new system for gathering near-real-time data on where whales are congregating so marine management agencies can alert ship operators and help prevent collisions with endangered whales in the San Francisco and Channel Islands regions.[4][5] Personnel[edit] Point Blue employs around 140 staff and seasonal biologists and around 14 education and outreach staff, who focus on scientific research, conservation biology, and outreach.

114,"Polish Ecological Club GB No. 3(18)/95 POLISH ECOLOGICAL CLUB HISTORY OF THE CLUB The Polish Ecological Club (PKE) was founded in Cracow in 1980 during the early days of the Solidarity opposition movement and is widely recognised as being the first legally established independent, non-profit, environmental non-governmental organisation in the former socialist block countries of Central and Eastern Europe. PKE was the first social organisation to openly protest against the policies of the existing government which treated the environment as an ownerless, valueless property and which imposed an energy-intensive economy based on heavy industry. THE GOAL OF OUR ACTIVITIES... is the practical implementation of true the concept of sustainable development; realising steady improvement in environmental conditions and the creation of society thought education that quality of life is depended on achieving a balance between technological development, humanistic values and wise stewardship of the earth's natural resources. The Polish Ecological Club... consist of a National Board in Cracow, 14 regional Branches and over 120 grassroots Circles operating throughout the country; brings together various experts and specialists working in Club's Commissions for Environmental Education, Waste Management, Water Management, National Parks, Law, Organic Farming, Transportation, Publications and Health; works with Members of Parliament and the Administration to support the formulation and implementation of environmentally sustainable policies; engages in environmental education through the editing and publishing of books and organisation of seminars and workshops; publishes a wide variety of scientific reports and bulletins, including regular publications of: ""To be or Not to Be"", ""Information Bulletin of the National Board"", ""NGOs & BANKs"", ""Green Series"", ""New Items for Central and Eastern Europe"", and Newsletters of different PKE's branches; organises actions and campaigns for the protection of the environment and human health; is a member of the following international organisations: Friends of the Earth - International, The World Conservation Union, Environment Liaison Centre International. 15 Years of PKE Achievements include... publication and distribution of hundred of thousand of books, booklets and pamphlets promoting environmental education; forcing the closure of a harmful electrolysis division of the aluminium plant near Cracow; major involvement in the formulation of the draft ""eco-developemnt' policy which become the official State Environmental Policy adopted by Parliament in 1991; successful opposition to the building of nuclear power plants near the cities of Klempicz and arnowiec; participation in the creation of the Environmental Impact Assessment Commission by the Ministry of Environment; public pressure leading to the closure of a highly polluting foundry in Siechnice; initiation and leadership of numerous successful actions against threats to the cultural heritage of Polish historical sites; participation in numerous European-wide programs such as the ""Action for Protected Areas in Europe"", ""Air Pollution Project Europe"", and the ""CEE Bankwatch Network""; ongoing campaign in opposition to the completion of the Mochovce nuclear power plant in neighbouring Slovakia. PROGRAMMES CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED BY THE PKE Eco-volunteers - a programme sponsored by the United Nations which provides financial and technical support to local activists working on community development and environmental issues. In Poland, 10 eco-volunteers works on issues such as promotion of healthy food, sustainable transportation, waste management and environmental education. NGOs & BANKs - campaign focusing on the collection, analysis and dissemination of information about the activities of International Financial Institutions in Poland and their environmental impact. The campaign is a part of the global movement to eliminate the destructive effects such institutions sometimes have and to assist them in making positive contributions to development processes. Green Consumerism - this campaign recognises the new role of citizens as consumers in the rapidly emerging market economy and promotes environment-friendly behaviour and attitudes as an alternative to ""run-away"" consumerism. It includes waste reduction actions and present criteria for identifying products which are more environment friendly then others. ICAP - The Information Centre on Air Protection has been operated by the Upper Silesia Branch of the PKE for several years, with the steady support of Swedish NGO Secretariat for Acid Rain.

115,"The Polish Ecological Club GB No. 5-6, summer-fall 1991 THE POLISH ECOLOGICAL CLUB History: The Polish Ecological Club (PKE) was founded on September 23, 1980, in Cracow, during the first Solidarity movement, by scientists, physicians, journalists and other persons aware of the Polish ecological crisis. PKE aimed to create a new environmental strategy based on respect for human and natural resources. It was the first such organization in Poland, recognizing from the beginning the social nature of environmental problems. PKE was officially registered on May 25, 1981, breaking the barrier of silence surrounding environmental problems in the country. In 1981, after a massive campaign, PKE forced the closure of the electrolysis division of the Skawina aluminum plant near Cracow, which was a major source of toxic fluorides. After this success, PKE set up 17 branches throughout Poland. The first president of PKE was Professor Przemysaw Szafer. During martial law some local branches were closed and their members persecuted. Those that remained active concentrated on PKE ideology and prepared numerous publications contributing to the growth of ecological awareness in society. PKE's first national meeting in 1983 saw the club become more elite. It was led by experts and known authorities, and Professor Stanisaw Juchnowicz was elected President. At that time PKE was in conflict with ERS (Ecological Social Movement), which had been created by the communist National Salvation Front to control other ecological organizations. PKE remained independent and a nonpolitical organization. PKE pursued ecological education in many ways, through seminars, the publication of several bulletins, protests, and even books, one of them being about the ecological disaster in Cracow. Cracow was declared to be a specially protected zone in 1989. Most essential was the creation of the concept of ""Eco-Development"", stemming from a conference organized by PKE in 1986. PKE introduced Eco-Development at the Polish ""round table"" on ecology, which took place in March/ April 1989. Out of 14 participants from Solidarity, 5 were from PKE, including the chairperson. The concept of Eco-Development was adopted as the first point in the protocol of the agreement between the government and the opposition. PKE contributions covered the majority of ecological problems expressed in the protocol. The document, finished after five weeks of intensive negotiations, contains the programme which is to be implemented in the next two years and also should be considered as a basis for the preparation of a National Programme of Environmental Protection in Poland. It addresses 5 groups of problems: Proecological activities in economic processes (incorporation of ecological goals into social and economic goals and the country's developmental plan). Regulation of laws concerning legal, economic and environmental aspects. International cooperation. Social system for the protection of the environment. Interventions. The only disagreement related to nuclear energy. Solidarity and PKE opposed the government's plans for nuclear power plant construction and demanded that the building of the nuclear power station in arnowiec on the Baltic coast be stopped. By the third National Meeting in 1990, PKE had 4,000 members in 17 branches. PKE is active in the preservation and enlargement of the National Parks, the evaluation of public health problems, the introduction of bio-dynamic methods into ecological agriculture, organizing days without cars, creating an Ecological Library, opposing nuclear power stations and forming links with ecological NGOs in other countries - partly to draw attention to transboundary emissions. PKE has helped the country to recover from the ecological damage caused by the Stalinist model of industrialization, but now it must be vigilant, for new threats are posed by the free market transfer of dangerous technologies. Platform: PKE disputes the opinion that during an economic crisis our country cannot afford to pay for the protection of the environment. Two aspects in particular should be considered: The slogan, ""First we become wealthy, then we will take care of the environment"", not only did not make us well-off, it brought us to economic and moral catastrophe, destroyed Polish nature, which as a consequence threatens the health of the nation. Increasing production without considering quality, together with a continual worsening of environmental conditions, creates mere quantitative prosperity, which is dangerous and illusory. We therefore feel that all economic reforms which aim to overcome the current crisis must consider the superiority of ecological demands as a requirement for improving our lives and as a guarantee of mental and physical health for this and future generations. PKE demands the consideration of the following reforms: Economical mechanisms and technical means for the protection of the environment. Development of master prices, which produce installations and technologies for the protection of the environment. Realization of the most important ecological demands, which are described below as principles of PKE activity: PKE relies on the principles of its Ideological Declaration and the Statute of the Club. Members of PKE realize the Club's program by: developing their ecological consciousness and spreading info about the environment; gathering complete information and knowledge about the environment and its changes; making a many-sided evaluation of the biological, social, and economic results of such changes; informing the public about environmental problems in order to create a common ecological education and consciousness; inspiring both social and institutional activities to overcome the existing environmental dangers; and undertaking particular programs concerning local ecological problems, which can be accomplished by PKE members. PKE pays particular attention to law and order as regards the protection of man, beings, and nature, creates its own opinions, and sends them to legislative bodies; PKE is trying to protect the nation from suicide by trying to: develop health education; assure help for pregnant women with proper conditions for giving birth to their babies as well as for bringing them up, in particular calling peoples' attention to the need for natural and healthy food; eliminate all mutagenic and toxic substances and the danger they cause from the environment; propagate a hygienic and healthy life, preventing smoking, drinking and drugs; renovate natural strength and develop physical fitness (exercising and gymnastics) and tourism, especially single; protest against all bad technologies used in constructing housing equipment, which is dangerous to the health, and to make demands for community design and development which assures proper living conditions. Agriculture is especially important to PKE. This requires the rational application of mineral fertilizers, and also a limitation on the use of toxic pesticides. Instead PKE propagates natural methods to obtain healthy products; PKE will initiate a new interdisciplinary model of the national economy, which considers a recycling of all technical processes, which thus do not influence the biological balance of nature; Regarding regional planning, PKE supports so-called ecosuburbanism, which considers all demands of environmental and esthetic values, protecting all historical landscapes and cultural heritage as superior to any temporary consumptive profits. Particular care should be given to: protect, maintain and increase the number of national parks and other preserved areas; and change the structure of regional planning in areas of ecological danger and create a proper quality of life there. PKE pays special attention to the problems of energy and supports international investigations of clear and wasteless energy resources (water, wind and sun energy); PKE feels it necessary to transform the existing model of economy, with a further development of those industrial branches which require the best of human invention and activity, at the same time limiting the raw materials industries; PKE feels that only/mainly public transportation should be developed, especially inside towns and the toxic substances from car exhaust should be eliminated. PKE heavily favours recycling; PKE demands the introduction to all school levels (kindergarten to university) of the subject of environmental protection. In this field PKE would cooperate with many other institutions, organizations and the Church; and PKE cares about the protection of animals as fellow inhabitants of the same environment.

Our main goal has been the practical implementation of sustainable development through raising environmental awareness in society, thus environmental education has been the first of our tasks. Making people aware that quality of life depends on achieving the balance between technological development, humanistic values and wise stewardship of the earth's natural resources, together with preserving natural, historical and cultural heritage is our main challenge. PKE works within the Green Consumer campaign, which promotes environmentally friendly models of consumption as an alternative to ""run-away"" consumerism. It has an energy campaign with the main goal of protecting the air and creating environmental awareness in the scope of energy and transportation issues. It has an organic farming and healthy food programme which promotes organic farming and alternatives to intensive rural policies, and coordinates the activities of NGOs in this area in the Baltic States. Finally, it has a Green Academy educational project, which delivers the most recent knowledge on environmental issues to teachers of different subjects, local activists and governments.

I recommend this experience to any student. Observing and participating in conversations based around legal/political issues, current events, and literature, increased my grasp and fluency in the language. I have no doubt that this will serve me well in my career, as well as serving as mark of personal pride and achievement. Adam Colorado, '17 Barcelona, Fall 2016 I am definitely happy that I took advantage of the exchange program.  I was able to meet lawyers and law students from all over the world, improve my Spanish skills, and immerse myself in a new culture.  Studying abroad requires an open mind and a willingness to adapt; two qualities that serve you well throughout your life. Carmen Gonzalez, '17 Barcelona, Spring 2016 Overview Pompeu Fabra University is dedicated to training responsible professionals and citizens committed to civic values and who contribute towards the development of outstanding research.

The CultureBarcelona is the capital and the most populous city of the Autonomous Community of Catalonia and the second largest city in Spain. The urban area of Barcelona extends beyond the administrative city and is the sixth-most populous urban area in the European Union. About 5 million people live in the Barcelona metropolitan area. It is also Europe's largest metropolis on the Mediterranean coast. Barcelona is recognized as a Global City due to its importance in finance, commerce, media, entertainment, arts, international trade, education and tourism. It is in addition the most popular tourist destination in Spain (receiving over 5 million tourists every year). Barcelona is the 15th most livable city in the World according to lifestyle magazine Monocle. Transportation to and from includes Barcelona international airport, an extensive motorway network and is a hub of high-speed rail, particularly that which will link France with Spain and later Portugal. Founded as a Roman city, Barcelona became the capital of the Counts of Barcelona. After merging with the Kingdom of Aragon, it became one of the most important cities of the Crown of Aragon. Besieged several times during its history, Barcelona is today an important cultural centre and has a rich cultural heritage. Particularly renowned are architectural works of Antoni Gaudí and Lluís Domènech i Montaner that have been designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The city is well known in recent times for the 1992 Summer Olympics. As the capital of Catalonia, Barcelona houses the seat of the Catalan government, known as the Generalitat de Catalunya; of particular note are the executive branch, the parliament, and the Supreme Court of Catalonia. The city is also the capital of the Province of Barcelona and the Barcelonès comarca (shire). Barcelona was always the stronghold of Catalan separatism and was the center of the Catalan Revolt (1640–52) against Philip IV of Spain. The resistance of Barcelona to Franco's coup d'état was to have lasting effects after the defeat of the Republican government. The autonomous institutions of Catalonia were abolished and the use of the Catalan language in public life was suppressed. Barcelona remained the second largest city in Spain, at the heart of a region which was relatively industrialized and prosperous, despite the devastation of the civil war. The result was a large-scale immigration from poorer regions of Spain (particularly Andalucia, Murcia and Galicia), which in turn led to rapid urbanization.

129,"Practical Action - Wikipedia Practical Action From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Practical ActionTypeINGOHeadquartersThe Robbins Building, Albert Street, Rugby, WarwickshireLocationUKRegion served InternationalWebsitepracticalaction.org Practical Action (previously known as the Intermediate Technology Development Group, ITDG) is a development charity registered in the United Kingdom[1] which works directly in four regions of the developing world – Latin America, East Africa, Southern Africa and South Asia, with particular concentration on Peru, Bolivia, Kenya, Sudan, Zimbabwe, Bangladesh and Nepal. In these countries, Practical Action works with poor communities to develop appropriate technologies in renewable energy, food production, agro-processing, water, sanitation, small enterprise development, building and shelter, climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction. Contents 1 History 2 Project work 3 See also 4 References 5 External links History[edit] In 1965, economist and philosopher E. F. Schumacher had an article published in The Observer,[2] pointing out the limitations of aid based on the transfer of large-scale technologies to developing countries which did not have the resources to accommodate them. He argued that there should be a shift in emphasis towards intermediate technologies based on the needs and skills possessed by the people of developing countries. Schumacher and a few of his associates, including George McRobie, Julia Porter,[3] Alfred Latham-Koenig and Professor Mansur Hoda, decided to create an ""advisory centre"" to promote the use of efficient labour-intensive techniques, and in 1966 the Intermediate Technology Development Group (ITDG) was born.[4] [5] From its origins as a technical enquiry service, ITDG began to take a greater direct involvement in local projects. Following initial successes in farming, it developed working groups on energy, building materials and rural health, and soon grew to become an international organisation. The group now has seven regional offices, working on over 100 projects around the world, with a head office in the UK. In July 2005, ITDG changed its working name to Practical Action, and since 2008 this has been its legal name. Project work[edit] Practical Action works in partnership with poor people and their communities, building on their own knowledge and skills to come up with innovative, sustainable and practical solutions. The organisation's project work is based around four international goals:[6] Energy that transforms - sustainable access to modern energy services by bringing rural communities, displaced people, energy providers and decision makers together to find sustainable, clean energy solutions. Farming that works - promoting the use of agroecology, providing the potential to transform the lives of millions of farming families struggling to adapt to a changing climate Urban water and waste - making sure cities are fit for people. They're helping to make cities in developing countries cleaner, healthier and fairer places to live and work Disaster risk reduction - having resilience that protects by helping to make resilience a way of life, by adapting to and preparing for a changing climate. Practical Action has seven regional and country offices.[7] See also[edit] Biofuel Hydro power Small Is Beautiful – a book by Schumacher Tools for Self Reliance References[edit] ^ ""Practical Action, registered charity no. 247257"".

In March 2020 government imposed a nationwide lockdown. The economy was at a standstill during the lockdown period and has struggled significantly to rebound thereafter. While all economic sectors have been affected, tourism, transportation, entertainment, education, are among the hardest hit. This paper has discussed different aspects of COVID19 and Renewable Energy in Nepal.  View How the theme of Adaptation and Resilience marginalizes L&D and why we must focus on addressing L&D The theme of Adaptation and Resilience ignores Loss and Damage entirely and uses instead the term “resilience” as a blanket term, ostensibly to include Loss and Damage without explicit recognition. This is problematic on several fronts. This paper briefly describes why it is critical that Loss and Damage be reflected prominently, both as a theme for discussions and as a focus of action, in the lead up to, and beyond COP 26. View Exploring loss and damage finance and its place in the Global Stocktake A new report from the Finance Working Group of the independent Global Stocktake (iGST), co-authored by the PRC, explores loss and damage finance and its place in the Global Stocktake. It outlines the practical challenges faced by national stakeholders and international climate finance providers in progressing the financing of loss and damage and in monitoring and tracking such finance. It also highlights the opportunity that the first GST of the Paris Agreement in 2023 presents for progressing L&D finance challenges.  View Climate Adaptation Finance Study Report of Nepal 2020 This report presents part of the outcome of an international pilot project on tracking climate adaptation finance which was simultaneously conducted covering six developing countries – Nepal, Ghana, Uganda, Ethiopia, Vietnam, and the Philippines. In Nepal, PRC has carried out this study in which analysis assessed multilateral and bilateral projects in support of climate change adaptation in the respective countries. View CFAS Policy Brief: Options for the post-2025 climate finance goal The formal negotiations on the post-2025 goal are yet to take off. But taking previous negotiations on climate finance matters into consideration, efforts of navigating all interests towards a satisfying decision should not be underestimated - not to mention the delay already imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. In light of this, this policy brief addresses key elements that should be considered for the process leading towards the definition of a post-2025 goal. Find more  View The USD 100 billion goal and lessons learned for the future of international climate finance Despite ongoing controversies surrounding the adequacy of financial support from developed countries, long-term climate finance has in fact grown and evolved over the past decade.

Our heritage, and much of what we believe, began with the French lawyer John Calvin (1509-1564), whose writings crystallized much of the Reformed thinking that came before him. Calvin did much of his writing from Geneva, Switzerland. From there, the Reformed movement spread to other parts of Europe and the British Isles. Many of the early Presbyterians in America came from England, Scotland and Ireland. The first American Presbytery was organized at Philadelphia in 1706. The first General Assembly was held in the same city in 1789. The first Assembly was convened by the Rev. John Witherspoon, the only minister to sign the Declaration of Independence.

CLC Update: New Narrative Questions for non-Teaching Elder Call Seekers In early March 2018, a couple of updates that affect call seekers who are not Ministers of Word and Sacrament or Candidates will go into effect: Those who are not ordained Teaching Elders (TE’s) or Candidates will be asked to respond to slightly modified narrative questions that are parallel to the current questions, and Only those positions that do not require ordination as Teaching Elder will be displayed for “Position Type.” These changes will only affect new Personal Information Forms (PIF’s) being entered after the March 2018 update. Those who already have PIF’s in the system will not be required to enter new PIF’s. These changes are based on feedback that some of the current narrative questions do not pertain to those whose experiences may not be in congregational settings or to those who feel called to ministry settings other than a congregation. Additionally, there was feedback that those who are not ordained TE’s were being shown positions that required TE ordination and so were mistakenly self-referring to those positions. We believe that only showing the position types that match the ordination status of each call seeker will simplify the position-type selection process and reduce confusion for call seekers and calling organizations. Since Commissioned Ruling Elders are commissioned to serve particular congregations through their presbyteries, we believe that this change will not adversely affect CRE’s at this time. The questions have been modified, so that call seekers may draw from work experiences outside the church setting in their answers. The parallel structure of the new narrative questions should allow for search committees to consider TE and non-TE candidates side-by-side. Those who are Ministers of Word and Sacrament and those who are Candidates for ordination as Ministers will continue to see the same narrative questions and position types. If you have questions about these changes, please contact CLC at clcstaff@pcusa.org or 800.728.7228 ext. 8550. contacts CLC Consultants 1.888.728.7228 x8550clcstaff@pcusa.org Featured Resources Transitional Ministry Education Offerings 2019 CLC Instructions for EPs CLC User Guide CLC COM Moderators Instructions CLC Instructions and User Guide for Stated Clerks View More Mid Council Ministries Certified Christian Educators Church Leadership Connection About CLC Call Seekers (Personal Information Form) Calling Organizations (Ministry Information Form) Forms and User Guides Opportunity Search Applicants and Positions Report On Calling a Pastor ""목사 청빙” 수정본 The Revised ""On Calling a Pastor"" Mid Council Directory Constitutional Interpretation Equity & Representation Immigration Issues Korean-Speaking Councils Support Mid Council Relations Ministers/ Teaching Elders Preparation for Ministry Ruling Elders Year of Leader Formation: Investing in Ruling Elders and Deacons Mid Council Leaders Gathering (formerly Polity Conference) National Certifying Bodies OGA: Office of the General Assembly For More Information: OGA Communications (888) 728-7228, x5750 Or Write To: 100 Witherspoon St. Louisville, KY 40202 © PC(USA) Privacy Policy Terms of Use Stated Clerk Stated Clerk GA Co-Moderators Ecclesial and Ecumenical Ministries Ecumenical Relations Per Capita Mid Council Ministries Mid Council Ministries Certified Christian Educators Church Leadership Connection Constitutional Interpretation Equity & Representation Immigration Issues Korean-Speaking Councils Support Mid Council Relations Ministers/ Teaching Elders Preparation for Ministry Ruling Elders Year of Leader Formation: Investing in Ruling Elders and Deacons Mid Council Leaders Gathering (formerly Polity Conference) National Certifying Bodies Churchwide Ministries General Assembly Meeting Service Presbyterian Historical Society -> Denominational Rolls and Statistics Committees General Assembly Special Committees and Task Forces Advisory Committee on Litigation Advisory Committee on the Constitution Committee on Representation Committee on the Office of the General Assembly General Assembly Committee on Ecumenical and Interreligious Relations General Assembly Nominating Committee General Assembly Permanent Judicial Commission Stated Clerk Nomination Committee Agencies Presbyterian Church (USA) Foundation Presbyterian Church (USA) Investment & Loan Program (PILP) Presbyterian Mission Agency Presbyterian Publishing Corporation (PPC) Board of Pensions Directories Church Directory Mid Council Directory Minister Directory index my stuff",Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)

A part of the Reformed tradition, it is the largest Presbyterian denomination in the US, and known for its relatively progressive stance on doctrine and ordains women and LGBT community as elders and ministers. The PC(USA) was established by the 1983 merger of the Presbyterian Church in the United States, whose churches were located in the Southern and border states, with the United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America, whose congregations could be found in every state. The similarly named Presbyterian Church in America is a separate denomination whose congregations can also trace their history to the various schisms and mergers of Presbyterian churches in the United States. The denomination had 1,245,354 active members and 18,785 ordained ministers (including retired[2]) in 8,925 congregations at the end of 2020.[1] This number does not include members who are baptized but who are not confirmed or the inactive members also affiliated.[3][4] For example, in 2005, the PC(USA) claimed 318,291 baptized, but not confirmed, members and nearly 500,000 inactive members in addition to active members.[5] Its membership has been declining over the past several decades; the trend has significantly accelerated in recent years, partly due to breakaway congregations.[6][7] Average denominational worship attendance dropped to 565,467 in 2017 from 748,774 in 2013.[8] The PC(USA) is the largest Presbyterian denomination in the United States.[9] Contents 1 History 1.1 Origins 1.2 19th century 1.3 20th century to the present 1.3.1 Mergers 1.3.2 Social justice initiatives and renewal movements 1.3.3 Breakaway Presbyterian denominations 1.3.4 Youth 2 Structure 2.1 Constitution 2.2 Councils 2.2.1 Session 2.2.2 Presbytery 2.2.3 Synod 2.2.4 Synods of the Presbyterian Church (USA) 2.2.5 General Assembly 2.2.5.1 Elected officials 2.2.5.2 Structure 2.3 Affiliated seminaries 2.4 Demographics 3 Worship 3.1 The Service for the Lord's Day 4 Influence 5 Missions 6 Ecumenical relationships and full communion partnerships 6.1 National and international ecumenical memberships 6.2 Formula of agreement 6.3 National and international ecumenical memberships 6.4 World Communion of Reformed Churches 6.5 Churches Uniting in Christ 7 Current controversies 7.1 Homosexuality 7.2 General Assembly 2006 7.3 General Assembly 2008 7.4 General Assembly 2010 7.5 General Assembly 2014 7.6 Property ownership 7.7 Israeli–Palestinian conflict 8 List of notable congregations 9 See also 10 References 11 Bibliography 12 Further reading 13 External links History[edit] See also: Presbyterianism in the United States Origins[edit] Presbyterians trace their history to the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century. The Presbyterian heritage, and much of its theology, began with the French theologian and lawyer John Calvin (1509–64), whose writings solidified much of the Reformed thinking that came before him in the form of the sermons and writings of Huldrych Zwingli. From Calvin's headquarters in Geneva, the Reformed movement spread to other parts of Europe.[10] John Knox, a former Roman Catholic priest from Scotland who studied with Calvin in Geneva, took Calvin's teachings back to Scotland and led the Scottish Reformation of 1560. Because of this reform movement, the Church of Scotland embraced Reformed theology and presbyterian polity.[11] The Ulster Scots brought their Presbyterian faith with them to Ireland, where they laid the foundation of what would become the Presbyterian Church in Ireland.[12] Immigrants from Scotland and Ireland brought Presbyterianism to America as early as 1640, and immigration would remain a large source of growth throughout the colonial era.[13] Another source of growth were a number of New England Puritans who left the Congregational churches because they preferred presbyterian polity. In 1706, seven ministers led by Francis Makemie established the first American presbytery at Philadelphia, which was followed by the creation of the Synod of Philadelphia in 1717.[14] The First Great Awakening and the revivalism it generated had a major impact on American Presbyterians. Ministers such as William and Gilbert Tennent, a friend of George Whitefield, emphasized the necessity of a conscious conversion experience and pushed for higher moral standards among the clergy.[15] Disagreements over revivalism, itinerant preaching, and educational requirements for clergy led to a division known as the Old Side–New Side Controversy that lasted from 1741 to 1758.[16] John Witherspoon, a Founding Father of the United States and first moderator of the Presbyterian Church in the USA In the South, the Presbyterians were evangelical dissenters, mostly Scotch-Irish, who expanded into Virginia between 1740 and 1758. Spangler (2008)[full citation needed] argues they were more energetic and held frequent services better attuned to the frontier conditions of the colony. Presbyterianism grew in frontier areas where the Anglicans had made little impression. Uneducated whites and blacks were attracted to the emotional worship of the denomination, its emphasis on biblical simplicity, and its psalm singing. Some local Presbyterian churches, such as Briery in Prince Edward County, owned slaves. The Briery church purchased five slaves in 1766 and raised money for church expenses by hiring them out to local planters.[17] First Presbyterian Church and Manse (Baltimore, Maryland) After the United States achieved independence from Great Britain, Presbyterian leaders felt that a national Presbyterian denomination was needed, and the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America (PCUSA) was organized. The first general assembly was held in Philadelphia in 1789.[18] John Witherspoon, president of Princeton University and the only minister to sign the Declaration of Independence, was the first moderator. Not all American Presbyterians participated in the creation of the PCUSA General Assembly because the divisions then occurring in the Church of Scotland were replicated in America. In 1751, Scottish Covenanters began sending ministers to America, and the Seceders were doing the same by 1753. In 1858, the majority of Covenanters and Seceders merged to create the United Presbyterian Church of North America (UPCNA).[19] 19th century[edit] In the decades after independence, many Americans including Calvinists (Presbyterians and Congregationalists), Methodists, and Baptists[20][21] were swept up in Protestant religious revivals that would later become known as the Second Great Awakening. Presbyterians also helped to shape voluntary societies that encouraged educational, missionary, evangelical, and reforming work. As its influence grew, many non-Presbyterians feared that the PCUSA's informal influence over American life might effectively make it an established church.[22] The Second Great Awakening divided the PCUSA over revivalism and fear that revivalism was leading to an embrace of Arminian theology. In 1810, frontier revivalists split from the PCUSA and organized the Cumberland Presbyterian Church.[23] Throughout the 1820s, support and opposition to revivalism hardened into well-defined factions, the New School and Old School respectively. By the 1838, the Old School–New School Controversy had divided the PCUSA. There were now two general assemblies each claiming to represent the PCUSA.[24] In 1858, the New School split along sectional lines when its Southern synods and presbyteries established the pro-slavery United Synod of the Presbyterian Church.[25] Old School Presbyterians followed in 1861 after the start of hostilities in the American Civil War with the formation of the Presbyterian Church in the Confederate States of America.[26] The Presbyterian Church in the CSA absorbed the smaller United Synod in 1864. After the war, this body was renamed the Presbyterian Church in the United States (PCUS) and was commonly nicknamed the ""Southern Presbyterian Church"" throughout its history.[25] In 1869, the northern PCUSA's Old School and New School factions reunited as well and was known as the ""Northern Presbyterian Church"".[27] 20th century to the present[edit] Main article: Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy Church of the Pilgrims (1928) in Washington, D.C. The First Presbyterian Church in Manhattan, New York City, seen from the south down Fifth Avenue The early part of the 20th century saw continued growth in both major sections of the church. It also saw the growth of Fundamentalist Christianity (a movement of those who believed in the literal interpretation of the Bible as the fundamental source of the religion) as distinguished from Modernist Christianity (a movement holding the belief that Christianity needed to be re-interpreted in light of modern scientific theories such as evolution or the rise of degraded social conditions brought on by industrialization and urbanization). Open controversy was sparked in 1922, when Harry Emerson Fosdick, a modernist and a Baptist pastoring a PCUSA congregation in New York City, preached a sermon entitled ""Shall the Fundamentalists Win?"" The crisis reached a head the following year when, in response to the New York Presbytery's decision to ordain a couple of men who could not affirm the virgin birth, the PCUSA's General Assembly reaffirmed the ""five fundamentals"": the deity of Christ, the Virgin Birth, the vicarious atonement, the inerrancy of Scripture, and Christ's miracles and resurrection.[28] This move against modernism caused a backlash in the form of the Auburn Affirmation — a document embracing liberalism and modernism. The liberals began a series of ecclesiastical trials of their opponents, expelled them from the church and seized their church buildings. Under the leadership of J. Gresham Machen, a former Princeton Theological Seminary New Testament professor who had founded Westminster Theological Seminary in 1929, and who was a PCUSA minister, many of these conservatives would establish what became known as the Orthodox Presbyterian Church in 1936. Although the 1930s and 1940s and the ensuing neo-orthodox theological consensus mitigated much of the polemics during the mid-20th century, disputes erupted again beginning in the mid-1960s over the extent of involvement in the civil rights movement and the issue of ordination of women, and, especially since the 1990s, over the issue of ordination of homosexuals. Mergers[edit] Evolution of Presbyterianism in the United States The Presbyterian Church in the United States of America was joined by the majority of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church, mostly congregations in the border and Southern states, in 1906. In 1920, it absorbed the Welsh Calvinist Methodist Church. The United Presbyterian Church of North America merged with the PCUSA in 1958 to form the United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America (UPCUSA). Under Eugene Carson Blake, the UPCUSA's stated clerk, the denomination entered into a period of social activism and ecumenical endeavors, which culminated in the development of the Confession of 1967 which was the church's first new confession of faith in three centuries. The 170th General Assembly in 1958 authorized a committee to develop a brief contemporary statement of faith. The 177th General Assembly in 1965 considered and amended the draft confession and sent a revised version for general discussion within the church. The 178th General Assembly in 1966 accepted a revised draft and sent it to presbyteries throughout the church for final ratification. As the confession was ratified by more than 90% of all presbyteries, the 178th General Assembly finally adopted it in 1967. The UPCUSA also adopted a Book of Confessions in 1967, which would include the Confession of 1967, the Westminster Confession and Westminster Shorter Catechism, the Heidelberg Catechism, the Second Helvetic and Scots Confessions and the Barmen Declaration.[29] An attempt to reunite the United Presbyterian Church in the USA with the Presbyterian Church in the United States in the late 1950s failed when the latter church was unwilling to accept ecclesiastical centralization. In the meantime, a conservative group broke away from the Presbyterian Church in the United States in 1973, mainly over the issues of women's ordination and a perceived drift toward theological liberalism. This group formed the Presbyterian Church in America (PCA). Attempts at union between the churches (UPCUSA and PCUS) were renewed in the 1970s, culminating in the merger of the two churches to form the Presbyterian Church (USA) on June 10, 1983. At the time of the merger, the churches had a combined membership of 3,121,238.[30] Many of the efforts were spearheaded by the financial and outspoken activism of retired businessman Thomas Clinton who died two years before the merger.[citation needed] A new national headquarters was established in Louisville, Kentucky in 1988 replacing the headquarters of the UPCUSA in New York City and the PCUS located in Atlanta, Georgia. The merger essentially consolidated moderate-to-liberal American Presbyterians into one body. Other US Presbyterian bodies (the Cumberland Presbyterians being a partial exception) place greater emphasis on doctrinal Calvinism, literalist hermeneutics, and conservative politics. For the most part, PC(USA) Presbyterians, not unlike similar mainline traditions such as the Episcopal Church and the United Church of Christ, are fairly progressive on matters such as doctrine, environmental issues, sexual morality, and economic issues, though the denomination remains divided and conflicted on these issues. Like other mainline denominations, the PC(USA) has also seen a great deal of demographic aging, with fewer new members and declining membership since 1967. Social justice initiatives and renewal movements[edit] In the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s, the General Assembly of PC(USA) adopted several social justice initiatives, which covered a range of topics including: stewardship of God's creation, world hunger, homelessness, and LGBT issues. As of 2011, the PC(USA) no longer excludes Partnered Gay and Lesbian ministers from the ministry. Previously, the PC(USA) required its ministers to remain ""chastely in singleness or with fidelity in marriage."" Currently, the PC(USA) permits teaching elders to perform same-gender marriages. On a congregational basis, individual sessions (congregational governing bodies) may choose to permit same-gender marriages.[31] These changes have led to several renewal movements and denominational splinters. Some conservative-minded groups in the PC(USA), such as the Confessing Movement and the Presbyterian Lay Committee (formed in the mid-1960s)[32] have remained in the main body, rather than leaving to form new, break-away groups. Breakaway Presbyterian denominations[edit] Several Presbyterian denominations have split from PC(USA) or its predecessors over the years. For example, the Orthodox Presbyterian Church broke away from the Presbyterian Church in the USA (PC-USA) in 1936. More recently formed Presbyterian denominations have attracted PC(USA) congregations disenchanted with the direction of the denomination, but wishing to continue in a Reformed, Presbyterian denomination. The Presbyterian Church in America (PCA), which does not allow ordained female clergy, separated from Presbyterian Church in the United States in 1973 and has subsequently become the second largest Presbyterian denomination in the United States. The Evangelical Presbyterian Church (EPC), which gives local presbyteries the option of allowing ordained female pastors, broke away from the United Presbyterian Church and incorporated in 1981. A PC(USA) renewal movement, Fellowship of Presbyterians (FOP) (now The Fellowship Community), held several national conferences serving disaffecting Presbyterians. FOP's organizing efforts culminated with the founding of ECO: A Covenant Order of Evangelical Presbyterians (ECO), a new Presbyterian denomination that allows ordination of women but is more conservative theologically than PC(USA). In 2013 the presbyteries ratified the General Assembly's 2012 vote to allow the ordination of openly gay persons to the ministry and in 2014 the General Assembly voted to amend the church's constitution to define marriage as the union of two persons instead of the union of a man and woman, which was ratified (by the presbyteries) in 2015. This has led to the departure of several hundred congregations. The majority of churches leaving the Presbyterian Church (USA) have chosen to join the Evangelical Presbyterian Church or ECO. Few have chosen to join the larger more conservative Presbyterian Church in America, which does not permit female clergy.[33] Youth[edit] Since 1983 the Presbyterian Youth Triennium has been held every three years at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, US, and is open to Presbyterian high school students throughout the world. The very first Youth Triennium was held in 1980 at Indiana University and the conference for teens is an effort of the Presbyterian Church (USA), the largest Presbyterian denomination in the nation; Cumberland Presbyterian Church; and Cumberland Presbyterian Church in America, the first African-American denomination to embrace Presbyterianism in the reformed tradition.[34] Since 1907, Montreat, North Carolina has hosted a youth conference every year. In 1983, Montreat Conference Center became a National Conference Center of the PC(USA) when the northern and southern denominational churches reunited.[35] Structure[edit] Main article: Presbyterian polity Brick Presbyterian Church (New York City) Constitution[edit] The Constitution of PC(USA) is composed of two portions: Part I, the Book of Confessions and Part II, the Book of Order. The Book of Confessions outlines the beliefs of the PC(USA) by declaring the creeds by which the Church's leaders are instructed and led. Complementing that is the Book of Order which gives the rationale and description for the organization and function of the Church at all levels. The Book of Order is currently divided into four sections – 1) The Foundations of Presbyterian Polity 2) The Form of Government, 3) The Directory For Worship, and 4) The Rules of Discipline. Councils[edit] Main article: List of Presbyterian Church (USA) synods and presbyteries See also: List of Moderators of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church (USA) Bel Air Presbyterian Church in California The Presbyterian Church (USA) has a representative form of government, known as presbyterian polity, with four levels of government and administration, as outlined in the Book of Order. The councils (governing bodies) are as follows: Session (of a Congregation) Presbytery Synod General Assembly Session[edit] At the congregational level, the governing body is called the session, from the Latin word sessio, meaning ""a sitting"". The session is made up of the pastors of the church and all elders elected and installed to active service. Following a pattern set in the first congregation of Christians in Jerusalem described in the Book of Acts in the New Testament, the church is governed by presbyters (a term and category that includes elders and Ministers of Word and Sacrament, historically also referred to as ""ruling or canon elders"" because they measure the spiritual life and work of a congregation and ministers as ""teaching elders"").[36] The elders are nominated by a nominating committee of the congregation; in addition, nominations from the floor are permissible. Elders are then elected by the congregation. All elders elected to serve on the congregation's session of elders are required to undergo a period of study and preparation for this order of ministry, after which the session examines the elders-elect as to their personal faith; knowledge of doctrine, government, and discipline contained in the Constitution of the church, and the duties of the office of elder. If the examination is approved, the session appoints a day for the service of ordination and installation.[37] Session meetings are normally moderated by a called and installed pastor and minutes are recorded by a clerk, who is also an ordained presbyter. If the congregation does not have an installed pastor, the Presbytery appoints a minister member or elected member of the presbytery as moderator with the concurrence of the local church session.[38] The moderator presides over the session as first among equals and also serves as a ""liturgical"" bishop over the ordination and installation of elders and deacons within a particular congregation. The session guides and directs the ministry of the local church, including almost all spiritual and fiduciary leadership. The congregation as a whole has only the responsibility to vote on: 1) the call of the pastor (subject to presbytery approval) and the terms of call (the church's provision for compensating and caring for the pastor); 2) the election of its own officers (elders and deacons); 3) buying, mortgaging, or selling real property. All other church matters such as the budget, personnel matters, and all programs for spiritual life and mission, are the responsibility of the session. In addition, the session serves as an ecclesiastical court to consider disciplinary charges brought against church officers or members. The session also oversees the work of the deacons, a second body of leaders also tracing its origins to the Book of Acts. The deacons are a congregational-level group whose duty is ""to minister to those who are in need, to the sick, to the friendless, and to any who may be in distress both within and beyond the community of faith."" In some churches, the responsibilities of the deacons are taken care of by the session, so there is no board of deacons in that church. In some states, churches are legally incorporated and members or elders of the church serve as trustees of the corporation. However, ""the power and duties of such trustees shall not infringe upon the powers and duties of the Session or of the board of deacons."" The deacons are a ministry board but not a governing body. Presbytery[edit] A presbytery is formed by all the congregations and the Ministers of Word and Sacrament in a geographic area together with elders selected (proportional to congregation size) from each of the congregations. Four special presbyteries are ""non-geographical"" in that they overlay other English-speaking presbyteries, though they are geographically limited to the boundaries of a particular synod (see below); it may be more accurate to refer to them as ""trans-geographical."" Three PC(USA) synods have a non-geographical presbytery for Korean language Presbyterian congregations, and one synod has a non-geographical presbytery for Native American congregations, the Dakota Presbytery. There are currently 166 presbyteries for the 8,925 congregations in the PC(USA).[39] Only the presbytery (not a congregation, session, synod, or General Assembly) has the responsibility and authority to ordain church members to the ordered ministry of Word and Sacrament, also referred to as a Teaching Elder, to install ministers to (and/or remove them from) congregations as pastors, and to remove a minister from the ministry. A Presbyterian minister is a member of a presbytery. The General Assembly cannot ordain or remove a Teaching Elder, but the Office of the General Assembly does maintain and publish a national directory with the help of each presbytery's stated clerk.[40] Bound versions are published bi-annually with the minutes of the General Assembly. A pastor cannot be a member of the congregation he or she serves as a pastor because his or her primary ecclesiastical accountability lies with the presbytery. Members of the congregation generally choose their own pastor with the assistance and support of the presbytery. The presbytery must approve the choice and officially install the pastor at the congregation, or approve the covenant for a temporary pastoral relationship. Additionally, the presbytery must approve if either the congregation or the pastor wishes to dissolve that pastoral relationship. The presbytery has authority over many affairs of its local congregations. Only the presbytery can approve the establishment, dissolution, or merger of congregations. The presbytery also maintains a Permanent Judicial Commission, which acts as a court of appeal from sessions, and which exercises original jurisdiction in disciplinary cases against minister members of the presbytery.[41] A presbytery has two elected officers: a moderator and a stated clerk. The Moderator of the presbytery is elected annually and is either a minister member or an elder commissioner from one of the presbytery's congregations. The Moderator presides at all presbytery assemblies and is the chief overseer at the ordination and installation of ministers in that presbytery.[42] The stated clerk is the chief ecclesial officer and serves as the presbytery's executive secretary and parliamentarian in accordance with the church Constitution and Robert's Rules of Order. While the moderator of a presbytery normally serves one year, the stated clerk normally serves a designated number of years and may be re-elected indefinitely by the presbytery. Additionally, an Executive Presbyter (sometimes designated as General Presbyter, Pastor to Presbytery, Transitional Presbyter) is often elected as a staff person to care for the administrative duties of the presbytery, often with the additional role of a pastor to the pastors. Presbyteries may be creative in the designation and assignment of duties for their staff. A presbytery is required to elect a Moderator and a Clerk, but the practice of hiring staff is optional. Presbyteries must meet at least twice a year, but they have the discretion to meet more often and most do. See ""Map of Presbyteries and Synods"".[43] Synod[edit] Presbyteries are organized within a geographical region to form a synod. Each synod contains at least three presbyteries, and its elected voting membership is to include both elders and Ministers of Word and Sacrament in equal numbers. Synods have various duties depending on the needs of the presbyteries they serve. In general, their responsibilities (G-12.0102) might be summarized as: developing and implementing the mission of the church throughout the region, facilitating communication between presbyteries and the General Assembly, and mediating conflicts between the churches and presbyteries. Every synod elects a Permanent Judicial Commission, which has original jurisdiction in remedial cases brought against its constituent presbyteries, and which also serves as an ecclesiastical court of appeal for decisions rendered by its presbyteries' Permanent Judicial Commissions. Synods are required to meet at least biennially. Meetings are moderated by an elected synod Moderator with support of the synod's Stated Clerk. There are currently 16 synods in the PC(USA) and they vary widely in the scope and nature of their work. An ongoing current debate in the denomination is over the purpose, function, and need for synods. First Presbyterian Church in Phoenix, Arizona Synods of the Presbyterian Church (USA)[edit] Synod of Alaska-Northwest Synod of Boriquen (Puerto Rico) Synod of the Covenant Synod of Lakes and Prairies Synod of Lincoln Trails Synod of Living Waters Synod of Mid-America Synod of Mid-Atlantic Synod of the Northeast Synod of the Pacific Synod of the Rocky Mountains Synod of South Atlantic Synod of Southern California and Hawaii Synod of the Southwest Synod of the Sun Synod of the Trinity Cathedral of Hope in Pittsburgh See also the List of Presbyterian Church (USA) synods and presbyteries.[44] General Assembly[edit] The General Assembly is the highest governing body of the PC(USA). Until the 216th assembly met in Richmond, Virginia in 2004, the General Assembly met annually; since 2004, the General Assembly has met biennially in even-numbered years. It consists of commissioners elected by presbyteries (not synods), and its voting membership is proportioned with parity between elders and Ministers of Word and Sacrament. There are many important responsibilities of the General Assembly. Among them, The Book of Order lists these four: to set priorities for the work of the church in keeping with the church's mission under Christ to develop overall objectives for mission and a comprehensive strategy to guide the church at every level of its life to provide the essential program functions that are appropriate for overall balance and diversity within the mission of the church, and to establish and administer national and worldwide ministries of witness, service, growth, and development. Elected officials[edit] Main article: List of Moderators of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church (USA) Fort Washington Presbyterian Church First Presbyterian Church (Plattsburgh, New York) The General Assembly elects a moderator at each assembly who moderates the rest of the sessions of that assembly meeting and continues to serve until the next assembly convenes (two years later) to elect a new moderator or co-moderator. Currently, the denomination is served by Co-Moderators Elona Street-Stewart and Gregory Bentley, who were elected at the 224th General Assembly (2020).[45] At the 223rd Assembly in St Louis, MO, Co-Moderators Elder Vilmarie Cintrón-Olivieri & The Rev. Cindy Kohmann were elected. See a complete listing of past moderators at another Wikipedia Article. A Stated Clerk is elected to a four-year term and is responsible for the Office of the General Assembly which conducts the ecclesiastical work of the church. The Office of the General Assembly carries out most of the ecumenical functions and all of the constitutional functions at the Assembly. The former Stated Clerk of the General Assembly is Gradye Parsons, who had served in that role since 2008 and was unanimously reelected in 2012.[46][47] Parsons did not stand for re-election at the 222nd General Assembly meeting in 2016, and J. Herbert Nelson was elected Stated Clerk at the 2016 General Assembly meeting in Portland. Nelson is the first African American to be elected to the office, and is a third-generation Presbyterian pastor.[48] The Stated Clerk is also responsible for the records of the denomination, a function formalized in 1925 when the General Assembly created the ""Department of Historical Research and Conservation"" as part of the Office of the General Assembly. The current ""Department of History"" is also known as the Presbyterian Historical Society.[49] Structure[edit] Peachtree Presbyterian Church in Atlanta, GA is currently the largest PC(USA) congregation Six agencies carry out the work of the General Assembly. These are the Office of the General Assembly, the Presbyterian Publishing Corporation, the Presbyterian Investment and Loan Program, the Board of Pensions, the Presbyterian Foundation, and the Presbyterian Mission Agency (formerly known as the General Assembly Mission Council). The General Assembly elects members of the Presbyterian Mission Agency Board (formerly General Assembly Mission Council). There are 48 elected members of the Presbyterian Mission Agency Board (40 voting members; 17 non-voting delegates), who represent synods, presbyteries, and the church at-large.[50] Members serve one six-year term, with the exception of the present Moderator of the General Assembly (one 2-year term), the past Moderator of the General Assembly (one 2-year term), the moderator of Presbyterian Women (one 3-year term), ecumenical advisory members (one 2-year term, eligible for two additional terms), and stewardship and audit committee at-large members (one 2-year term, eligible for two additional terms). Among the elected members' major responsibilities is the coordination of the work of the program areas in light of General Assembly mission directions, objectives, goals and priorities. The PMAB meets three times a year. The General Assembly elects an Executive Director of the Presbyterian Mission Agency who is the top administrator overseeing the mission work of the PC(USA). Past Executive Director of the PMA is Ruling Elder Linda Bryant Valentine(2006-2015), and Interim RE Tony De La Rosa. Elected in 2018 is Teaching Elder Diane Givens Moffett (2018- ). The General Assembly Permanent Judicial Commission (GAPJC) is the highest Church court of the denomination. It composed of one member elected by the General Assembly from each of its constituent synods (16). It has ultimate appellate jurisdiction over all Synod Permanent Judicial Commission cases involving issues of Church Constitution, and original jurisdiction over a small range of cases. The General Assembly Permanent Judicial Commission issues Authoritative Interpretations of The Constitution of the Presbyterian Church (USA) through its decisions. www.ipc-usa.org/worship/ Affiliated seminaries[edit] Main article: Presbyterian Church (USA) seminaries The denomination maintains affiliations with ten seminaries in the United States. These are: Austin Presbyterian Theological Seminary in Austin, Texas Columbia Theological Seminary in Decatur, Georgia Johnson C. Smith Theological Seminary in Atlanta, Georgia Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary in Louisville. Kentucky McCormick Theological Seminary in Chicago, Illinois Pittsburgh Theological Seminary, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Princeton Theological Seminary, the first chartered by the General Assembly, in Princeton, New Jersey San Francisco Theological Seminary in San Anselmo, Marin County, California (disputed)[51][52] Union Presbyterian Seminary in Richmond, Virginia and Charlotte, North Carolina University of Dubuque Theological Seminary in Dubuque, Iowa Two other seminaries are related to the PC(USA) by covenant agreement: Auburn Theological Seminary in New York, New York, and Evangelical Seminary of Puerto Rico in San Juan, Puerto Rico. There are numerous colleges and universities throughout the United States affiliated with PC(USA). For a complete list, see the article Association of Presbyterian Colleges and Universities. For more information, see the article PC(USA) seminaries. While not affiliated with the PC(USA), the president of Fuller Theological Seminary, Mark Labberton, is an ordained minister of the PC(USA) and the seminary educates many candidates for ministry.[53] Demographics[edit] When the United Presbyterian Church in the USA merged with the Presbyterian Church in the United States there were 3,131,228 members. Statistics shows steadily decline since 1983. (The combined membership of the PCUS and United Presbyterian Church peaked in 1965 at 4.25 million communicant members.[54]) Year Membership pct change 1984 3,100,951 −0.98 1985 3,057,226 −1.43 1986 3,016,488 −1.35 1987 2,976,937 −1.33 1988 2,938,830 −1.30 1989 2,895,706 −1.49 1990 2,856,713 −1.36 1991 2,815,045 −1.48 1992 2,780,406 −1.25 1993 2,742,192 −1.39 1994 2,698,262 −1.63 1995 2,665,276 −1.24 1996 2,631,466 −1.28 1997 2,609,191 −0.85 1998 2,587,674 −0.83 1999 2,560,201 −1.07 2000 2,525,330 −1.38 2001 2,493,781 −1.27 2002 2,451,969 −1.71 2003 2,405,311 −1.94 2004 2,362,136 −1.83 2005 2,316,662 −2.10 2006 2,267,118 −2.05 2007 2,209,546 −2.61 2008 2,140,165 −3.23 2009 2,077,138 −3.03 2010 2,016,091 −3.03 2011 1,952,287 −3.29 2012 1,849,496 −5.26[55] 2013 1,760,200 −4.83[56] 2014 1,667,767 −5.54[57] 2015 1,572,660 −5.70[58] 2016 1,482,767 −5.71 2017 1,415,053 −4.56 2018 1,352,678 -4.41[59] 2019 1,302,043 -3.74[60] 2020 1,245,354 -4.35[1] The PC (USA) has had the sharpest decline in their membership among the protestant denominations in U.S.A.[citation needed] The denomination lost more than a million members during last 14 years (2005-2019). As of 2020, the denomination has 1,245,354 members and about 8,925 local congregations. The average local Presbyterian Church has 148 members (the mean in 2018).[56] About 37% of the total congregations report between 1 and 50 members. Another 23% report between 51 and 100 members. The average worship attendance of a local Presbyterian congregation is 77 (51.7% of members). The largest congregation in the PC(USA) is Peachtree Presbyterian Church in Atlanta, Georgia, with a reported membership of 8,989 (2009). It was reported that about 31% of the Presbyterian members are over 71 years old (2018). Most PC(USA) members are white (92.9%). Other racial and ethnic members include African-Americans (3.1% of the total membership of the denomination), Asians (2.3%), Hispanics (1.2%), Native Americans (0.2%), and others (0.3%). Despite declines in the total membership of the PC(USA), the percentage of racial-ethnic minority members has stayed about the same since 1995. The ratio of female members (58%) to male members (42%) has also remained stable since the mid-1960s.[61] Presbyterians are among the wealthiest Christians denomination in the United States,[62] Presbyterians tend also to be better educated and they have a high number of graduate (64%) and post-graduate degrees (26%) per capita.[63] According to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, Presbyterians ranked as the fourth most financially successful religious group in the United States, with 32% of Presbyterians living in households with incomes of at least $100,000.[64] Worship[edit] The session of the local congregation has a great deal of freedom in the style and ordering of worship within the guidelines set forth in the Directory for Worship section of the Book of Order.[65] Worship varies from congregation to congregation. The order may be very traditional and highly liturgical, or it may be very simple and informal. This variance is not unlike that seen in the ""High Church"" and ""Low Church"" styles of the Anglican Church. The Book of Order suggests a worship service ordered around five themes: ""gathering around the Word, proclaiming the Word, responding to the Word, the sealing of the Word, and bearing and following the Word into the world."" Prayer is central to the service and may be silent, spoken, sung, or read in unison (including The Lord's Prayer). Music plays a large role in most PC(USA) worship services and ranges from chant to traditional Protestant hymns, to classical sacred music, to more modern music, depending on the preference of the individual church and is offered prayerfully and not ""for entertainment or artistic display."" Scripture is read and usually preached upon. An offering is usually taken.[66] The pastor has certain responsibilities which are not subject to the authority of the session. In a particular service of worship the pastor is responsible for: the selection of Scripture lessons to be read, the preparation and preaching of the sermon or exposition of the Bible, the prayers offered on behalf of the people and those prepared for the use of the people in worship, the music to be sung, the use of drama, dance, and other art forms. The pastor may confer with a worship committee in planning particular services of worship.— [W-1.4005] The Directory for Worship in the Book of Order provides the directions for what must be, or may be included in worship. During the 20th century, Presbyterians were offered optional use of liturgical books: The Book of Common Worship of 1906 The Book of Common Worship of 1932 The Book of Common Worship of 1946 The Worshipbook of 1970 (spelling is correct) The Book of Common Worship of 1993 For more information, see Liturgical book of the Presbyterian Church (USA) In regard to vestments, the Directory for Worship leaves that decision up to the ministers. Thus, on a given Sunday morning service, a congregation may see the minister leading worship in street clothes, Geneva gown, or an alb. Among the Paleo-orthodoxy and emerging church Presbyterians, clergy are moving away from the traditional black Geneva gown and reclaiming not only the more ancient Eucharist vestments of alb and chasuble, but also cassock and surplice (typically a full length Old English style surplice which resembles the Celtic alb, an ungirdled liturgical tunic of the old Gallican Rite). The Service for the Lord's Day[edit] The Service for the Lord's Day is the name given to the general format or ordering of worship in the Presbyterian Church as outlined in its Constitution's Book of Order. There is a great deal of liberty given toward worship in that denomination, so while the underlying order and components for the Service for the Lord's Day is extremely common, it varies from congregation to congregation, region to region. Typical Presbyterian Church USA Order of Worship would look like this. This is taken from Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church, NYC Order of Worship | Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church The creation of the Service for the Lord's Day was one of the most positive contributions of the Worshipbook of 1970. The Book of Common Worship of 1993 leaned heavily upon this service. Influence[edit] Presbyterians are among the wealthiest religious groups and are disproportionately represented in American business, law, and politics.[67][68][58] Many Presbyterians have been Presidents, the latest being Ronald Reagan;[69] and they represent 13% of the U.S. Senate, despite being only 2.2% of the general population.[70] Missions[edit] The Presbyterian Church (USA) has, in the past, been a leading United States denomination in mission work, and many hospitals, clinics, colleges and universities worldwide trace their origins to the pioneering work of Presbyterian missionaries who founded them more than a century ago. Currently, the church supports about 215 missionaries abroad annually.[71] Many churches sponsor missionaries abroad at the session level, and these are not included in official statistics. A vital part of the world mission emphasis of the denomination is building and maintaining relationships with Presbyterian, Reformed and other churches around the world, even if this is not usually considered missions. The PC(USA) is a leader in disaster assistance relief and also participates in or relates to work in other countries through ecumenical relationships, in what is usually considered not missions, but deaconship. Ecumenical relationships and full communion partnerships[edit] The General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church (USA) determines and approves ecumenical statements, agreements, and maintains correspondence with other Presbyterian and Reformed bodies, other Christians churches, alliances, councils, and consortia. Ecumenical statements and agreements are subject to the ratification of the presbyteries. The following are some of the major ecumenical agreements and partnerships. The church is committed to ""engage in bilateral and multilateral dialogues with other churches and traditions in order to remove barriers of misunderstanding and establish common affirmations.""[72] As of 2012 it is in dialog with the Episcopal Church, the Moravian Church, the Korean Presbyterian Church in America, the Cumberland Presbyterian Church, the Cumberland Presbyterian Church in America, and the US Conference of Catholic Bishops. It also participates in international dialogues through the World Council of Churches and the World Communion of Reformed Churches. The most recent international dialogues include Pentecostal churches, the Seventh-day Adventist Church, Orthodox Church in America, and others. In 2011 the National Presbyterian Church in Mexico, in 2012 the Mizoram Presbyterian Church[73] and in 2015 the Independent Presbyterian Church of Brazil along with the Evangelical Presbyterian and Reformed Church in Peru severed ties with the PCUSA because of the PCUSA's teaching with regard to homosexuality.[74] National and international ecumenical memberships[edit] The Presbyterian Church (USA) is in corresponding partnership with the National Council of Churches, the World Communion of Reformed Churches,[75] and the World Council of Churches. It is a member of Churches for Middle East Peace. Formula of agreement[edit] Old Whaler's Church (Sag Harbor) In 1997 the PCUSA and three other churches of Reformation heritage: the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the Reformed Church in America and the United Church of Christ, acted on an ecumenical proposal of historic importance, known as A Formula of Agreement. The timing reflected a doctrinal consensus which had been developing over the past thirty-two years coupled with an increasing urgency for the church to proclaim a gospel of unity in contemporary society. In light of identified doctrinal consensus, desiring to bear visible witness to the unity of the Church, and hearing the call to engage together in God's mission, it was recommended: That the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the Presbyterian Church (USA), the Reformed Church in America, and the United Church of Christ declare on the basis of A Common Calling and their adoption of this A Formula of Agreement that they are in full communion with one another. Thus, each church is entering into or affirming full communion with three other churches.[76] The term ""full communion"" is understood here to specifically mean that the four churches: recognize each other as churches in which the gospel is rightly preached and the sacraments rightly administered according to the Word of God; withdraw any historic condemnation by one side or the other as inappropriate for the life and faith of our churches today; continue to recognize each other's Baptism and authorize and encourage the sharing of the Lord's Supper among their members; recognize each other's various ministries and make provision for the orderly exchange of ordained ministers of Word and Sacrament; establish appropriate channels of consultation and decision-making within the existing structures of the churches; commit themselves to an ongoing process of theological dialogue in order to clarify further the common understanding of the faith and foster its common expression in evangelism, witness, and service; pledge themselves to living together under the Gospel in such a way that the principle of mutual affirmation and admonition becomes the basis of a trusting relationship in which respect and love for the other will have a chance to grow. The agreement assumed the doctrinal consensus articulated in A Common Calling:The Witness of Our Reformation Churches in North America Today, and is to be viewed in concert with that document. The purpose of A Formula of Agreement is to elucidate the complementarity of affirmation and admonition as the basic principle of entering into full communion and the implications of that action as described in A Common Calling. The 209th General Assembly (1997) approved A Formula of Agreement and in 1998 the 210th General Assembly declared full communion among these Protestant bodies. National and international ecumenical memberships[edit] The Presbyterian Church (USA) is in corresponding partnership with the National Council of Churches, the World Communion of Reformed Churches,[77] Christian Churches Together, and the World Council of Churches. World Communion of Reformed Churches[edit] As of June 2010, the World Alliance of Reformed Churches merged with the Reformed Ecumenical Council to form the World Communion of Reformed Churches. The result was a form of full communion similar to that outline in the Formula of Agreement, including orderly exchange of ministers. Churches Uniting in Christ[edit] The PC(USA) is one of nine denominations that joined together to form the Consultation on Church Union, which initially sought a merger of the denominations. In 1998 the Seventh Plenary of the Consultation on Church Union approved a document ""Churches in Covenant Communion: The Church of Christ Uniting"" as a plan for the formation of a covenant communion of churches. In 2002 the nine denominations inaugurated the new relationship and became known as Churches Uniting in Christ. The partnership is considered incomplete until the partnering communions reconcile their understanding of ordination and devise an orderly exchange of clergy. Current controversies[edit] Homosexuality[edit] Main article: Homosexuality and Presbyterianism Paragraph G-6.0106b of the Book of Order, which was adopted in 1996, prohibited the ordination of those who were not faithful in heterosexual marriage or chaste in singleness. This paragraph was included in the Book of Order from 1997 to 2011, and was commonly referred to by its pre-ratification designation, ""Amendment B"".[78] Several attempts were made to remove this from the Book of Order, ultimately culminating in its removal in 2011. In 2011, the Presbyteries of the PC(USA) passed Amendment 10-A permitting congregations to ordain openly gay and lesbian elders and deacons, and allowing presbyteries to ordain ministers without reference to the fidelity/chastity provision, saying ""governing bodies shall be guided by Scripture and the confessions in applying standards to individual candidates"".[79] Many Presbyterian scholars, pastors, and theologians have been heavily involved in the debate over homosexuality over the years. The Presbyterian Church of India's cooperation with the Presbyterian Church (USA) was dissolved in 2012 when the PC(USA) voted to ordain openly gay clergy to the ministry.[80] In 2012, the PC(USA) granted permission, nationally, to begin ordaining openly gay and lesbian clergy.[81] Since 1980, the More Light Churches Network has served many congregations and individuals within American Presbyterianism who promote the full participation of all people in the PC(USA) regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. The Covenant Network of Presbyterians was formed in 1997 to support repeal of ""Amendment B"" and to encourage networking amongst like-minded clergy and congregations.[82] Other organizations of Presbyterians, such as the Confessing Movement and the Alliance of Confessing Evangelicals, have organized on the other side of the issue to support the fidelity/chastity standard for ordination, which was removed in 2011. The Presbyterian Church (USA) voted to allow same-sex marriages on June 19, 2014 during its 221st General Assembly, making it one of the largest Christian denominations in the world to allow same-sex unions. This vote lifted a previous ban, and allows pastors to perform marriages in jurisdictions where it is legal. Additionally, the Assembly approved amending the Book of Order that would change the definition of marriage from ""between a man and a woman"" to ""between two people, traditionally between a man and a woman"". General Assembly 2006[edit] The 2006 Report of the Theological Task Force on Peace, Unity, and Purity of the Church,[83] in theory, attempted to find common ground. Some felt that the adoption of this report provided for a clear local option mentioned, while the Stated Clerk of the General Assembly, Clifton Kirkpatrick went on record as saying, ""Our standards have not changed. The rules of the Book of Order stay in force and all ordinations are still subject to review by higher governing bodies."" The authors of the report stated that it is a compromise and return to the original Presbyterian culture of local controls. The recommendation for more control by local presbyteries and sessions is viewed by its opposition as a method for bypassing the constitutional restrictions currently in place concerning ordination and marriage, effectively making the constitutional ""standard"" entirely subjective. In the General Assembly gathering of June 2006, Presbyterian voting Commissioners passed an ""authoritative interpretation"", recommended by the Theological Task Force, of the Book of Order (the church constitution). Some argued that this gave presbyteries the ""local option"" of ordaining or not ordaining anyone based on a particular presbytery's reading of the constitutional statute. Others argued that presbyteries have always had this responsibility and that this new ruling did not change but only clarified that responsibility. On June 20, 2006, the General Assembly voted 298 to 221 (or 57% to 43%) to approve such interpretation. In that same session on June 20, the General Assembly also voted 405 to 92 (with 4 abstentions) to uphold the constitutional standard for ordination requiring fidelity in marriage or chastity in singleness. General Assembly 2008[edit] The General Assembly of 2008 took several actions related to homosexuality. The first action was to adopt a different translation of the Heidelberg Catechism from 1962, removing the words ""homosexual perversions"" among other changes. This will require the approval of the 2010 and 2012 General Assemblies as well as the votes of the presbyteries after the 2010 Assembly.[needs update][84] The second action was to approve a new Authoritative Interpretation of G-6.0108 of the Book of Order allowing for the ordaining body to make decisions on whether or not a departure from the standards of belief of practice is sufficient to preclude ordination.[85] Some argue that this creates ""local option"" on ordaining homosexual persons. The third action was to replace the text of ""Amendment B"" with new text: ""Those who are called to ordained service in the church, by their assent to the constitutional questions for ordination and installation (W-4.4003), pledge themselves to live lives obedient to Jesus Christ the Head of the Church, striving to follow where he leads through the witness of the Scriptures, and to understand the Scriptures through the instruction of the Confessions. In so doing, they declare their fidelity to the standards of the Church. Each governing body charged with examination for ordination and/or installation (G-14.0240 and G-14.0450) establishes the candidate's sincere efforts to adhere to these standards.""[86] This would have removed the ""fidelity and chastity"" clause. This third action failed to obtain the required approval of a majority of the presbyteries by June 2009. Fourth, a resolution was adopted to affirm the definition of marriage from Scripture and the Confessions as being between a man and a woman.[87] General Assembly 2010[edit] In July 2010, by a vote of 373 to 323, the General Assembly voted to propose to the presbyteries for ratification a constitutional amendment to remove from the Book of Order section G-6.0106.b. which included this explicit requirement for ordination: ""Among these standards is the requirement to live either in fidelity within the covenant of marriage between a man and a woman (W-4.9001), or chastity in singleness."" This proposal required ratification by a majority of the 173 presbyteries within 12 months of the General Assembly's adjournment.[88][89] A majority of presbytery votes was reached in May 2011. The constitutional amendment took effect July 10, 2011.[90] This amendment shifted back to the ordaining body the responsibility for making decisions about whom they shall ordain and what they shall require of their candidates for ordination. It neither prevents nor imposes the use of the so-called ""fidelity and chastity"" requirement, but it removes that decision from the text of the constitution and places that judgment responsibility back upon the ordaining body where it had traditionally been prior to the insertion of the former G-6.0106.b. in 1997. Each ordaining body, the session for deacon or elder and the presbytery for minister, is now responsible to make its own interpretation of what scripture and the confessions require of ordained officers. General Assembly 2014[edit] In June 2014, the General Assembly approved a change in the wording of its constitution to define marriage a contract ""between a woman and a man"" to being ""between two people, traditionally a man and a woman"". It allowed gay and lesbian weddings within the church and further allow clergy to perform same-sex weddings. That revision gave clergy the choice of presiding over same-sex marriages, but clergy was not compelled to perform same-sex marriage. Property ownership[edit] PC(USA)'s book of order includes a ""trust clause"", which grants ownership of church property to the presbytery. Under this trust clause, the presbytery may assert a claim to the property of the congregation in the event of a congregational split, dissolution (closing), or disassociation from the PC(USA). This clause does not prevent particular churches from leaving the denomination, but if they do, they may not be entitled to any physical assets of that congregation unless by agreement with the presbytery. Recently this provision has been vigorously tested in courts of law. Israeli–Palestinian conflict[edit] Main article: Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) disinvestment from Israel controversy See also: Disinvestment from Israel In June 2004, the General Assembly met in Richmond, Virginia, and adopted by a vote of 431–62 a resolution that called on the church's committee on Mission Responsibility through Investment (MRTI) ""to initiate a process of phased, selective divestment in multinational corporations operating in Israel"". The resolution also said ""the occupation ... has proven to be at the root of evil acts committed against innocent people on both sides of the conflict"".[91] The church statement at the time noted that ""divestment is one of the strategies that U.S. churches used in the 1970s and 80s in a successful campaign to end apartheid in South Africa"". A second resolution, calling for an end to the construction of a wall by the state of Israel, passed.[92] The resolution opposed to the construction of the Israeli West Bank barrier, regardless of its location, and opposed the United States government making monetary contribution to the construction. The General Assembly also adopted policies rejecting Christian Zionism and allowing the continued funding of conversionary activities aimed at Jews. Together, the resolutions caused tremendous dissent within the church and a sharp disconnect with the Jewish community. Leaders of several American Jewish groups communicated to the church their concerns about the use of economic leverages that apply specifically to companies operating in Israel.[93] Some critics of the divestment policy accused church leaders of anti-Semitism.[94][95][96] In June 2006, after the General Assembly in Birmingham, Alabama changed policy (details), both pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian groups praised the resolution. Pro-Israel groups, who had written General Assembly commissioners to express their concerns about a corporate engagement/divestment strategy focused on Israel,[97] praised the new resolution, saying that it reflected the church stepping back from a policy that singled out companies working in Israel.[98] Pro-Palestinian groups said that the church maintained the opportunity to engage and potentially divest from companies that support the Israeli occupation, because such support would be considered inappropriate according to the customary MRTI process. In August 2011, the American National Middle Eastern Presbyterian Caucus (NMEPC) endorsed the boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS) campaign against Israel.[99] In January 2014, The PC(USA) published ""Zionism unsettled"", which was commended as ""a valuable opportunity to explore the political ideology of Zionism"".[100] One critic claimed it was anti-Zionist and characterised the Israeli–Palestinian as a conflict fueled by a ""pathology inherent in Zionism"".[101] The Simon Wiesenthal Center described the study guide as ""a hit-piece outside all norms of interfaith dialogue. It is a compendium of distortions, ignorance and outright lies – that tragically has emanated too often from elites within this church"".[102] The PC(USA) subsequently withdrew the publication from sale on its website.[103] On June 20, 2014 the General Assembly in Detroit approved a measure (310–303) calling for divestment from stock in Caterpillar, Hewlett-Packard and Motorola Solutions in protest of Israeli policies on the West Bank. The vote was immediately and sharply criticized by the American Jewish Committee which accused the General Assembly of acting out of anti-Semitic motives. Proponents of the measure strongly denied the accusations.[104] List of notable congregations[edit] Independent Presbyterian Church in Birmingham, Alabama[105] Bel Air Presbyterian Church in Bel Air, California Brick Presbyterian Church (New York City) Church of the Covenant (Boston) Church of the Pilgrims (Washington DC) the Cathedral of Hope (Pittsburgh), also known as East Liberty Presbyterian Church[106] Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church (Manhattan) First Presbyterian Church (Charlotte, North Carolina)[107] First Presbyterian Church (Manhattan) First Presbyterian Church (Nashville, Tennessee) First Presbyterian Church (Springfield, Illinois) Fort Street Presbyterian Church (Detroit, Michigan) Fort Washington Presbyterian Church Fourth Presbyterian Church (Chicago) Highland Presbyterian Church (Kentucky) Idlewild Presbyterian Church in Memphis, Tennessee Kirk in the Hills (Bloomfield Township, Oakland County) Lincoln Park Presbyterian Church (Lincoln Park, Michigan) Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church (New York City) Myers Park Presbyterian Church (Charlotte, North Carolina) National Presbyterian Church (Washington, District of Columbia) Old Pine Street Church (Philadelphia) Peachtree Presbyterian Church (Atlanta) Rutgers Presbyterian Church (New York City) Second Presbyterian Church (Indianapolis, Indiana) Shadyside Presbyterian Church in Pittsburgh University Presbyterian Church (Seattle, Washington) Village Presbyterian Church (Prairie Village, Kansas) Westminster Presbyterian Church (Los Angeles) Westminster Presbyterian Church (Minneapolis) West-Park Presbyterian Church (Manhattan) Woods Memorial Presbyterian Church (Severna Park, Maryland) See also[edit] United States portal Calvinism portal Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church Association of Presbyterian Colleges and Universities Churches Uniting in Christ Cumberland Presbyterian Church Evangelical Presbyterian Church (United States) Ghost Ranch Ordination exams Orthodox Presbyterian Church Presbyterian Church in America Presbyterian Church (USA) Hezbollah controversy Presbyterian Youth Connection Reformed Churches in North America Religion in Louisville, Kentucky Protestantism in the United States Christianity in the United States Category:American Presbyterians References[edit] ^ a b c d Church (U.S.A.), Presbyterian (April 24, 2021).

A part of the Reformed tradition, it is the largest Presbyterian denomination in the US, and known for its relatively progressive stance on doctrine and ordains women and LGBT community as elders and ministers. The PC(USA) was established by the 1983 merger of the Presbyterian Church in the United States, whose churches were located in the Southern and border states, with the United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America, whose congregations could be found in every state. The similarly named Presbyterian Church in America is a separate denomination whose congregations can also trace their history to the various schisms and mergers of Presbyterian churches in the United States. The denomination had 1,245,354 active members and 18,785 ordained ministers (including retired[2]) in 8,925 congregations at the end of 2020.[1] This number does not include members who are baptized but who are not confirmed or the inactive members also affiliated.[3][4] For example, in 2005, the PC(USA) claimed 318,291 baptized, but not confirmed, members and nearly 500,000 inactive members in addition to active members.[5] Its membership has been declining over the past several decades; the trend has significantly accelerated in recent years, partly due to breakaway congregations.[6][7] Average denominational worship attendance dropped to 565,467 in 2017 from 748,774 in 2013.[8] The PC(USA) is the largest Presbyterian denomination in the United States.[9] Contents 1 History 1.1 Origins 1.2 19th century 1.3 20th century to the present 1.3.1 Mergers 1.3.2 Social justice initiatives and renewal movements 1.3.3 Breakaway Presbyterian denominations 1.3.4 Youth 2 Structure 2.1 Constitution 2.2 Councils 2.2.1 Session 2.2.2 Presbytery 2.2.3 Synod 2.2.4 Synods of the Presbyterian Church (USA) 2.2.5 General Assembly 2.2.5.1 Elected officials 2.2.5.2 Structure 2.3 Affiliated seminaries 2.4 Demographics 3 Worship 3.1 The Service for the Lord's Day 4 Influence 5 Missions 6 Ecumenical relationships and full communion partnerships 6.1 National and international ecumenical memberships 6.2 Formula of agreement 6.3 National and international ecumenical memberships 6.4 World Communion of Reformed Churches 6.5 Churches Uniting in Christ 7 Current controversies 7.1 Homosexuality 7.2 General Assembly 2006 7.3 General Assembly 2008 7.4 General Assembly 2010 7.5 General Assembly 2014 7.6 Property ownership 7.7 Israeli–Palestinian conflict 8 List of notable congregations 9 See also 10 References 11 Bibliography 12 Further reading 13 External links History[edit] See also: Presbyterianism in the United States Origins[edit] Presbyterians trace their history to the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century. The Presbyterian heritage, and much of its theology, began with the French theologian and lawyer John Calvin (1509–64), whose writings solidified much of the Reformed thinking that came before him in the form of the sermons and writings of Huldrych Zwingli. From Calvin's headquarters in Geneva, the Reformed movement spread to other parts of Europe.[10] John Knox, a former Roman Catholic priest from Scotland who studied with Calvin in Geneva, took Calvin's teachings back to Scotland and led the Scottish Reformation of 1560. Because of this reform movement, the Church of Scotland embraced Reformed theology and presbyterian polity.[11] The Ulster Scots brought their Presbyterian faith with them to Ireland, where they laid the foundation of what would become the Presbyterian Church in Ireland.[12] Immigrants from Scotland and Ireland brought Presbyterianism to America as early as 1640, and immigration would remain a large source of growth throughout the colonial era.[13] Another source of growth were a number of New England Puritans who left the Congregational churches because they preferred presbyterian polity. In 1706, seven ministers led by Francis Makemie established the first American presbytery at Philadelphia, which was followed by the creation of the Synod of Philadelphia in 1717.[14] The First Great Awakening and the revivalism it generated had a major impact on American Presbyterians. Ministers such as William and Gilbert Tennent, a friend of George Whitefield, emphasized the necessity of a conscious conversion experience and pushed for higher moral standards among the clergy.[15] Disagreements over revivalism, itinerant preaching, and educational requirements for clergy led to a division known as the Old Side–New Side Controversy that lasted from 1741 to 1758.[16] John Witherspoon, a Founding Father of the United States and first moderator of the Presbyterian Church in the USA In the South, the Presbyterians were evangelical dissenters, mostly Scotch-Irish, who expanded into Virginia between 1740 and 1758. Spangler (2008)[full citation needed] argues they were more energetic and held frequent services better attuned to the frontier conditions of the colony. Presbyterianism grew in frontier areas where the Anglicans had made little impression. Uneducated whites and blacks were attracted to the emotional worship of the denomination, its emphasis on biblical simplicity, and its psalm singing. Some local Presbyterian churches, such as Briery in Prince Edward County, owned slaves. The Briery church purchased five slaves in 1766 and raised money for church expenses by hiring them out to local planters.[17] First Presbyterian Church and Manse (Baltimore, Maryland) After the United States achieved independence from Great Britain, Presbyterian leaders felt that a national Presbyterian denomination was needed, and the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America (PCUSA) was organized. The first general assembly was held in Philadelphia in 1789.[18] John Witherspoon, president of Princeton University and the only minister to sign the Declaration of Independence, was the first moderator. Not all American Presbyterians participated in the creation of the PCUSA General Assembly because the divisions then occurring in the Church of Scotland were replicated in America. In 1751, Scottish Covenanters began sending ministers to America, and the Seceders were doing the same by 1753. In 1858, the majority of Covenanters and Seceders merged to create the United Presbyterian Church of North America (UPCNA).[19] 19th century[edit] In the decades after independence, many Americans including Calvinists (Presbyterians and Congregationalists), Methodists, and Baptists[20][21] were swept up in Protestant religious revivals that would later become known as the Second Great Awakening. Presbyterians also helped to shape voluntary societies that encouraged educational, missionary, evangelical, and reforming work. As its influence grew, many non-Presbyterians feared that the PCUSA's informal influence over American life might effectively make it an established church.[22] The Second Great Awakening divided the PCUSA over revivalism and fear that revivalism was leading to an embrace of Arminian theology. In 1810, frontier revivalists split from the PCUSA and organized the Cumberland Presbyterian Church.[23] Throughout the 1820s, support and opposition to revivalism hardened into well-defined factions, the New School and Old School respectively. By the 1838, the Old School–New School Controversy had divided the PCUSA. There were now two general assemblies each claiming to represent the PCUSA.[24] In 1858, the New School split along sectional lines when its Southern synods and presbyteries established the pro-slavery United Synod of the Presbyterian Church.[25] Old School Presbyterians followed in 1861 after the start of hostilities in the American Civil War with the formation of the Presbyterian Church in the Confederate States of America.[26] The Presbyterian Church in the CSA absorbed the smaller United Synod in 1864. After the war, this body was renamed the Presbyterian Church in the United States (PCUS) and was commonly nicknamed the ""Southern Presbyterian Church"" throughout its history.[25] In 1869, the northern PCUSA's Old School and New School factions reunited as well and was known as the ""Northern Presbyterian Church"".[27] 20th century to the present[edit] Main article: Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy Church of the Pilgrims (1928) in Washington, D.C. The First Presbyterian Church in Manhattan, New York City, seen from the south down Fifth Avenue The early part of the 20th century saw continued growth in both major sections of the church. It also saw the growth of Fundamentalist Christianity (a movement of those who believed in the literal interpretation of the Bible as the fundamental source of the religion) as distinguished from Modernist Christianity (a movement holding the belief that Christianity needed to be re-interpreted in light of modern scientific theories such as evolution or the rise of degraded social conditions brought on by industrialization and urbanization). Open controversy was sparked in 1922, when Harry Emerson Fosdick, a modernist and a Baptist pastoring a PCUSA congregation in New York City, preached a sermon entitled ""Shall the Fundamentalists Win?"" The crisis reached a head the following year when, in response to the New York Presbytery's decision to ordain a couple of men who could not affirm the virgin birth, the PCUSA's General Assembly reaffirmed the ""five fundamentals"": the deity of Christ, the Virgin Birth, the vicarious atonement, the inerrancy of Scripture, and Christ's miracles and resurrection.[28] This move against modernism caused a backlash in the form of the Auburn Affirmation — a document embracing liberalism and modernism. The liberals began a series of ecclesiastical trials of their opponents, expelled them from the church and seized their church buildings. Under the leadership of J. Gresham Machen, a former Princeton Theological Seminary New Testament professor who had founded Westminster Theological Seminary in 1929, and who was a PCUSA minister, many of these conservatives would establish what became known as the Orthodox Presbyterian Church in 1936. Although the 1930s and 1940s and the ensuing neo-orthodox theological consensus mitigated much of the polemics during the mid-20th century, disputes erupted again beginning in the mid-1960s over the extent of involvement in the civil rights movement and the issue of ordination of women, and, especially since the 1990s, over the issue of ordination of homosexuals. Mergers[edit] Evolution of Presbyterianism in the United States The Presbyterian Church in the United States of America was joined by the majority of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church, mostly congregations in the border and Southern states, in 1906. In 1920, it absorbed the Welsh Calvinist Methodist Church. The United Presbyterian Church of North America merged with the PCUSA in 1958 to form the United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America (UPCUSA). Under Eugene Carson Blake, the UPCUSA's stated clerk, the denomination entered into a period of social activism and ecumenical endeavors, which culminated in the development of the Confession of 1967 which was the church's first new confession of faith in three centuries. The 170th General Assembly in 1958 authorized a committee to develop a brief contemporary statement of faith. The 177th General Assembly in 1965 considered and amended the draft confession and sent a revised version for general discussion within the church. The 178th General Assembly in 1966 accepted a revised draft and sent it to presbyteries throughout the church for final ratification. As the confession was ratified by more than 90% of all presbyteries, the 178th General Assembly finally adopted it in 1967. The UPCUSA also adopted a Book of Confessions in 1967, which would include the Confession of 1967, the Westminster Confession and Westminster Shorter Catechism, the Heidelberg Catechism, the Second Helvetic and Scots Confessions and the Barmen Declaration.[29] An attempt to reunite the United Presbyterian Church in the USA with the Presbyterian Church in the United States in the late 1950s failed when the latter church was unwilling to accept ecclesiastical centralization. In the meantime, a conservative group broke away from the Presbyterian Church in the United States in 1973, mainly over the issues of women's ordination and a perceived drift toward theological liberalism. This group formed the Presbyterian Church in America (PCA). Attempts at union between the churches (UPCUSA and PCUS) were renewed in the 1970s, culminating in the merger of the two churches to form the Presbyterian Church (USA) on June 10, 1983. At the time of the merger, the churches had a combined membership of 3,121,238.[30] Many of the efforts were spearheaded by the financial and outspoken activism of retired businessman Thomas Clinton who died two years before the merger.[citation needed] A new national headquarters was established in Louisville, Kentucky in 1988 replacing the headquarters of the UPCUSA in New York City and the PCUS located in Atlanta, Georgia. The merger essentially consolidated moderate-to-liberal American Presbyterians into one body. Other US Presbyterian bodies (the Cumberland Presbyterians being a partial exception) place greater emphasis on doctrinal Calvinism, literalist hermeneutics, and conservative politics. For the most part, PC(USA) Presbyterians, not unlike similar mainline traditions such as the Episcopal Church and the United Church of Christ, are fairly progressive on matters such as doctrine, environmental issues, sexual morality, and economic issues, though the denomination remains divided and conflicted on these issues. Like other mainline denominations, the PC(USA) has also seen a great deal of demographic aging, with fewer new members and declining membership since 1967. Social justice initiatives and renewal movements[edit] In the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s, the General Assembly of PC(USA) adopted several social justice initiatives, which covered a range of topics including: stewardship of God's creation, world hunger, homelessness, and LGBT issues. As of 2011, the PC(USA) no longer excludes Partnered Gay and Lesbian ministers from the ministry. Previously, the PC(USA) required its ministers to remain ""chastely in singleness or with fidelity in marriage."" Currently, the PC(USA) permits teaching elders to perform same-gender marriages. On a congregational basis, individual sessions (congregational governing bodies) may choose to permit same-gender marriages.[31] These changes have led to several renewal movements and denominational splinters. Some conservative-minded groups in the PC(USA), such as the Confessing Movement and the Presbyterian Lay Committee (formed in the mid-1960s)[32] have remained in the main body, rather than leaving to form new, break-away groups. Breakaway Presbyterian denominations[edit] Several Presbyterian denominations have split from PC(USA) or its predecessors over the years. For example, the Orthodox Presbyterian Church broke away from the Presbyterian Church in the USA (PC-USA) in 1936. More recently formed Presbyterian denominations have attracted PC(USA) congregations disenchanted with the direction of the denomination, but wishing to continue in a Reformed, Presbyterian denomination. The Presbyterian Church in America (PCA), which does not allow ordained female clergy, separated from Presbyterian Church in the United States in 1973 and has subsequently become the second largest Presbyterian denomination in the United States. The Evangelical Presbyterian Church (EPC), which gives local presbyteries the option of allowing ordained female pastors, broke away from the United Presbyterian Church and incorporated in 1981. A PC(USA) renewal movement, Fellowship of Presbyterians (FOP) (now The Fellowship Community), held several national conferences serving disaffecting Presbyterians. FOP's organizing efforts culminated with the founding of ECO: A Covenant Order of Evangelical Presbyterians (ECO), a new Presbyterian denomination that allows ordination of women but is more conservative theologically than PC(USA). In 2013 the presbyteries ratified the General Assembly's 2012 vote to allow the ordination of openly gay persons to the ministry and in 2014 the General Assembly voted to amend the church's constitution to define marriage as the union of two persons instead of the union of a man and woman, which was ratified (by the presbyteries) in 2015. This has led to the departure of several hundred congregations. The majority of churches leaving the Presbyterian Church (USA) have chosen to join the Evangelical Presbyterian Church or ECO. Few have chosen to join the larger more conservative Presbyterian Church in America, which does not permit female clergy.[33] Youth[edit] Since 1983 the Presbyterian Youth Triennium has been held every three years at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, US, and is open to Presbyterian high school students throughout the world. The very first Youth Triennium was held in 1980 at Indiana University and the conference for teens is an effort of the Presbyterian Church (USA), the largest Presbyterian denomination in the nation; Cumberland Presbyterian Church; and Cumberland Presbyterian Church in America, the first African-American denomination to embrace Presbyterianism in the reformed tradition.[34] Since 1907, Montreat, North Carolina has hosted a youth conference every year. In 1983, Montreat Conference Center became a National Conference Center of the PC(USA) when the northern and southern denominational churches reunited.[35] Structure[edit] Main article: Presbyterian polity Brick Presbyterian Church (New York City) Constitution[edit] The Constitution of PC(USA) is composed of two portions: Part I, the Book of Confessions and Part II, the Book of Order. The Book of Confessions outlines the beliefs of the PC(USA) by declaring the creeds by which the Church's leaders are instructed and led. Complementing that is the Book of Order which gives the rationale and description for the organization and function of the Church at all levels. The Book of Order is currently divided into four sections – 1) The Foundations of Presbyterian Polity 2) The Form of Government, 3) The Directory For Worship, and 4) The Rules of Discipline. Councils[edit] Main article: List of Presbyterian Church (USA) synods and presbyteries See also: List of Moderators of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church (USA) Bel Air Presbyterian Church in California The Presbyterian Church (USA) has a representative form of government, known as presbyterian polity, with four levels of government and administration, as outlined in the Book of Order. The councils (governing bodies) are as follows: Session (of a Congregation) Presbytery Synod General Assembly Session[edit] At the congregational level, the governing body is called the session, from the Latin word sessio, meaning ""a sitting"". The session is made up of the pastors of the church and all elders elected and installed to active service. Following a pattern set in the first congregation of Christians in Jerusalem described in the Book of Acts in the New Testament, the church is governed by presbyters (a term and category that includes elders and Ministers of Word and Sacrament, historically also referred to as ""ruling or canon elders"" because they measure the spiritual life and work of a congregation and ministers as ""teaching elders"").[36] The elders are nominated by a nominating committee of the congregation; in addition, nominations from the floor are permissible. Elders are then elected by the congregation. All elders elected to serve on the congregation's session of elders are required to undergo a period of study and preparation for this order of ministry, after which the session examines the elders-elect as to their personal faith; knowledge of doctrine, government, and discipline contained in the Constitution of the church, and the duties of the office of elder. If the examination is approved, the session appoints a day for the service of ordination and installation.[37] Session meetings are normally moderated by a called and installed pastor and minutes are recorded by a clerk, who is also an ordained presbyter. If the congregation does not have an installed pastor, the Presbytery appoints a minister member or elected member of the presbytery as moderator with the concurrence of the local church session.[38] The moderator presides over the session as first among equals and also serves as a ""liturgical"" bishop over the ordination and installation of elders and deacons within a particular congregation. The session guides and directs the ministry of the local church, including almost all spiritual and fiduciary leadership. The congregation as a whole has only the responsibility to vote on: 1) the call of the pastor (subject to presbytery approval) and the terms of call (the church's provision for compensating and caring for the pastor); 2) the election of its own officers (elders and deacons); 3) buying, mortgaging, or selling real property. All other church matters such as the budget, personnel matters, and all programs for spiritual life and mission, are the responsibility of the session. In addition, the session serves as an ecclesiastical court to consider disciplinary charges brought against church officers or members. The session also oversees the work of the deacons, a second body of leaders also tracing its origins to the Book of Acts. The deacons are a congregational-level group whose duty is ""to minister to those who are in need, to the sick, to the friendless, and to any who may be in distress both within and beyond the community of faith."" In some churches, the responsibilities of the deacons are taken care of by the session, so there is no board of deacons in that church. In some states, churches are legally incorporated and members or elders of the church serve as trustees of the corporation. However, ""the power and duties of such trustees shall not infringe upon the powers and duties of the Session or of the board of deacons."" The deacons are a ministry board but not a governing body. Presbytery[edit] A presbytery is formed by all the congregations and the Ministers of Word and Sacrament in a geographic area together with elders selected (proportional to congregation size) from each of the congregations. Four special presbyteries are ""non-geographical"" in that they overlay other English-speaking presbyteries, though they are geographically limited to the boundaries of a particular synod (see below); it may be more accurate to refer to them as ""trans-geographical."" Three PC(USA) synods have a non-geographical presbytery for Korean language Presbyterian congregations, and one synod has a non-geographical presbytery for Native American congregations, the Dakota Presbytery. There are currently 166 presbyteries for the 8,925 congregations in the PC(USA).[39] Only the presbytery (not a congregation, session, synod, or General Assembly) has the responsibility and authority to ordain church members to the ordered ministry of Word and Sacrament, also referred to as a Teaching Elder, to install ministers to (and/or remove them from) congregations as pastors, and to remove a minister from the ministry. A Presbyterian minister is a member of a presbytery. The General Assembly cannot ordain or remove a Teaching Elder, but the Office of the General Assembly does maintain and publish a national directory with the help of each presbytery's stated clerk.[40] Bound versions are published bi-annually with the minutes of the General Assembly. A pastor cannot be a member of the congregation he or she serves as a pastor because his or her primary ecclesiastical accountability lies with the presbytery. Members of the congregation generally choose their own pastor with the assistance and support of the presbytery. The presbytery must approve the choice and officially install the pastor at the congregation, or approve the covenant for a temporary pastoral relationship. Additionally, the presbytery must approve if either the congregation or the pastor wishes to dissolve that pastoral relationship. The presbytery has authority over many affairs of its local congregations. Only the presbytery can approve the establishment, dissolution, or merger of congregations. The presbytery also maintains a Permanent Judicial Commission, which acts as a court of appeal from sessions, and which exercises original jurisdiction in disciplinary cases against minister members of the presbytery.[41] A presbytery has two elected officers: a moderator and a stated clerk. The Moderator of the presbytery is elected annually and is either a minister member or an elder commissioner from one of the presbytery's congregations. The Moderator presides at all presbytery assemblies and is the chief overseer at the ordination and installation of ministers in that presbytery.[42] The stated clerk is the chief ecclesial officer and serves as the presbytery's executive secretary and parliamentarian in accordance with the church Constitution and Robert's Rules of Order. While the moderator of a presbytery normally serves one year, the stated clerk normally serves a designated number of years and may be re-elected indefinitely by the presbytery. Additionally, an Executive Presbyter (sometimes designated as General Presbyter, Pastor to Presbytery, Transitional Presbyter) is often elected as a staff person to care for the administrative duties of the presbytery, often with the additional role of a pastor to the pastors. Presbyteries may be creative in the designation and assignment of duties for their staff. A presbytery is required to elect a Moderator and a Clerk, but the practice of hiring staff is optional. Presbyteries must meet at least twice a year, but they have the discretion to meet more often and most do. See ""Map of Presbyteries and Synods"".[43] Synod[edit] Presbyteries are organized within a geographical region to form a synod. Each synod contains at least three presbyteries, and its elected voting membership is to include both elders and Ministers of Word and Sacrament in equal numbers. Synods have various duties depending on the needs of the presbyteries they serve. In general, their responsibilities (G-12.0102) might be summarized as: developing and implementing the mission of the church throughout the region, facilitating communication between presbyteries and the General Assembly, and mediating conflicts between the churches and presbyteries. Every synod elects a Permanent Judicial Commission, which has original jurisdiction in remedial cases brought against its constituent presbyteries, and which also serves as an ecclesiastical court of appeal for decisions rendered by its presbyteries' Permanent Judicial Commissions. Synods are required to meet at least biennially. Meetings are moderated by an elected synod Moderator with support of the synod's Stated Clerk. There are currently 16 synods in the PC(USA) and they vary widely in the scope and nature of their work. An ongoing current debate in the denomination is over the purpose, function, and need for synods. First Presbyterian Church in Phoenix, Arizona Synods of the Presbyterian Church (USA)[edit] Synod of Alaska-Northwest Synod of Boriquen (Puerto Rico) Synod of the Covenant Synod of Lakes and Prairies Synod of Lincoln Trails Synod of Living Waters Synod of Mid-America Synod of Mid-Atlantic Synod of the Northeast Synod of the Pacific Synod of the Rocky Mountains Synod of South Atlantic Synod of Southern California and Hawaii Synod of the Southwest Synod of the Sun Synod of the Trinity Cathedral of Hope in Pittsburgh See also the List of Presbyterian Church (USA) synods and presbyteries.[44] General Assembly[edit] The General Assembly is the highest governing body of the PC(USA). Until the 216th assembly met in Richmond, Virginia in 2004, the General Assembly met annually; since 2004, the General Assembly has met biennially in even-numbered years. It consists of commissioners elected by presbyteries (not synods), and its voting membership is proportioned with parity between elders and Ministers of Word and Sacrament. There are many important responsibilities of the General Assembly. Among them, The Book of Order lists these four: to set priorities for the work of the church in keeping with the church's mission under Christ to develop overall objectives for mission and a comprehensive strategy to guide the church at every level of its life to provide the essential program functions that are appropriate for overall balance and diversity within the mission of the church, and to establish and administer national and worldwide ministries of witness, service, growth, and development. Elected officials[edit] Main article: List of Moderators of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church (USA) Fort Washington Presbyterian Church First Presbyterian Church (Plattsburgh, New York) The General Assembly elects a moderator at each assembly who moderates the rest of the sessions of that assembly meeting and continues to serve until the next assembly convenes (two years later) to elect a new moderator or co-moderator. Currently, the denomination is served by Co-Moderators Elona Street-Stewart and Gregory Bentley, who were elected at the 224th General Assembly (2020).[45] At the 223rd Assembly in St Louis, MO, Co-Moderators Elder Vilmarie Cintrón-Olivieri & The Rev. Cindy Kohmann were elected. See a complete listing of past moderators at another Wikipedia Article. A Stated Clerk is elected to a four-year term and is responsible for the Office of the General Assembly which conducts the ecclesiastical work of the church. The Office of the General Assembly carries out most of the ecumenical functions and all of the constitutional functions at the Assembly. The former Stated Clerk of the General Assembly is Gradye Parsons, who had served in that role since 2008 and was unanimously reelected in 2012.[46][47] Parsons did not stand for re-election at the 222nd General Assembly meeting in 2016, and J. Herbert Nelson was elected Stated Clerk at the 2016 General Assembly meeting in Portland. Nelson is the first African American to be elected to the office, and is a third-generation Presbyterian pastor.[48] The Stated Clerk is also responsible for the records of the denomination, a function formalized in 1925 when the General Assembly created the ""Department of Historical Research and Conservation"" as part of the Office of the General Assembly. The current ""Department of History"" is also known as the Presbyterian Historical Society.[49] Structure[edit] Peachtree Presbyterian Church in Atlanta, GA is currently the largest PC(USA) congregation Six agencies carry out the work of the General Assembly. These are the Office of the General Assembly, the Presbyterian Publishing Corporation, the Presbyterian Investment and Loan Program, the Board of Pensions, the Presbyterian Foundation, and the Presbyterian Mission Agency (formerly known as the General Assembly Mission Council). The General Assembly elects members of the Presbyterian Mission Agency Board (formerly General Assembly Mission Council). There are 48 elected members of the Presbyterian Mission Agency Board (40 voting members; 17 non-voting delegates), who represent synods, presbyteries, and the church at-large.[50] Members serve one six-year term, with the exception of the present Moderator of the General Assembly (one 2-year term), the past Moderator of the General Assembly (one 2-year term), the moderator of Presbyterian Women (one 3-year term), ecumenical advisory members (one 2-year term, eligible for two additional terms), and stewardship and audit committee at-large members (one 2-year term, eligible for two additional terms). Among the elected members' major responsibilities is the coordination of the work of the program areas in light of General Assembly mission directions, objectives, goals and priorities. The PMAB meets three times a year. The General Assembly elects an Executive Director of the Presbyterian Mission Agency who is the top administrator overseeing the mission work of the PC(USA). Past Executive Director of the PMA is Ruling Elder Linda Bryant Valentine(2006-2015), and Interim RE Tony De La Rosa. Elected in 2018 is Teaching Elder Diane Givens Moffett (2018- ). The General Assembly Permanent Judicial Commission (GAPJC) is the highest Church court of the denomination. It composed of one member elected by the General Assembly from each of its constituent synods (16). It has ultimate appellate jurisdiction over all Synod Permanent Judicial Commission cases involving issues of Church Constitution, and original jurisdiction over a small range of cases. The General Assembly Permanent Judicial Commission issues Authoritative Interpretations of The Constitution of the Presbyterian Church (USA) through its decisions. www.ipc-usa.org/worship/ Affiliated seminaries[edit] Main article: Presbyterian Church (USA) seminaries The denomination maintains affiliations with ten seminaries in the United States. These are: Austin Presbyterian Theological Seminary in Austin, Texas Columbia Theological Seminary in Decatur, Georgia Johnson C. Smith Theological Seminary in Atlanta, Georgia Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary in Louisville. Kentucky McCormick Theological Seminary in Chicago, Illinois Pittsburgh Theological Seminary, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Princeton Theological Seminary, the first chartered by the General Assembly, in Princeton, New Jersey San Francisco Theological Seminary in San Anselmo, Marin County, California (disputed)[51][52] Union Presbyterian Seminary in Richmond, Virginia and Charlotte, North Carolina University of Dubuque Theological Seminary in Dubuque, Iowa Two other seminaries are related to the PC(USA) by covenant agreement: Auburn Theological Seminary in New York, New York, and Evangelical Seminary of Puerto Rico in San Juan, Puerto Rico. There are numerous colleges and universities throughout the United States affiliated with PC(USA). For a complete list, see the article Association of Presbyterian Colleges and Universities. For more information, see the article PC(USA) seminaries. While not affiliated with the PC(USA), the president of Fuller Theological Seminary, Mark Labberton, is an ordained minister of the PC(USA) and the seminary educates many candidates for ministry.[53] Demographics[edit] When the United Presbyterian Church in the USA merged with the Presbyterian Church in the United States there were 3,131,228 members. Statistics shows steadily decline since 1983. (The combined membership of the PCUS and United Presbyterian Church peaked in 1965 at 4.25 million communicant members.[54]) Year Membership pct change 1984 3,100,951 −0.98 1985 3,057,226 −1.43 1986 3,016,488 −1.35 1987 2,976,937 −1.33 1988 2,938,830 −1.30 1989 2,895,706 −1.49 1990 2,856,713 −1.36 1991 2,815,045 −1.48 1992 2,780,406 −1.25 1993 2,742,192 −1.39 1994 2,698,262 −1.63 1995 2,665,276 −1.24 1996 2,631,466 −1.28 1997 2,609,191 −0.85 1998 2,587,674 −0.83 1999 2,560,201 −1.07 2000 2,525,330 −1.38 2001 2,493,781 −1.27 2002 2,451,969 −1.71 2003 2,405,311 −1.94 2004 2,362,136 −1.83 2005 2,316,662 −2.10 2006 2,267,118 −2.05 2007 2,209,546 −2.61 2008 2,140,165 −3.23 2009 2,077,138 −3.03 2010 2,016,091 −3.03 2011 1,952,287 −3.29 2012 1,849,496 −5.26[55] 2013 1,760,200 −4.83[56] 2014 1,667,767 −5.54[57] 2015 1,572,660 −5.70[58] 2016 1,482,767 −5.71 2017 1,415,053 −4.56 2018 1,352,678 -4.41[59] 2019 1,302,043 -3.74[60] 2020 1,245,354 -4.35[1] The PC (USA) has had the sharpest decline in their membership among the protestant denominations in U.S.A.[citation needed] The denomination lost more than a million members during last 14 years (2005-2019). As of 2020, the denomination has 1,245,354 members and about 8,925 local congregations. The average local Presbyterian Church has 148 members (the mean in 2018).[56] About 37% of the total congregations report between 1 and 50 members. Another 23% report between 51 and 100 members. The average worship attendance of a local Presbyterian congregation is 77 (51.7% of members). The largest congregation in the PC(USA) is Peachtree Presbyterian Church in Atlanta, Georgia, with a reported membership of 8,989 (2009). It was reported that about 31% of the Presbyterian members are over 71 years old (2018). Most PC(USA) members are white (92.9%). Other racial and ethnic members include African-Americans (3.1% of the total membership of the denomination), Asians (2.3%), Hispanics (1.2%), Native Americans (0.2%), and others (0.3%). Despite declines in the total membership of the PC(USA), the percentage of racial-ethnic minority members has stayed about the same since 1995. The ratio of female members (58%) to male members (42%) has also remained stable since the mid-1960s.[61] Presbyterians are among the wealthiest Christians denomination in the United States,[62] Presbyterians tend also to be better educated and they have a high number of graduate (64%) and post-graduate degrees (26%) per capita.[63] According to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, Presbyterians ranked as the fourth most financially successful religious group in the United States, with 32% of Presbyterians living in households with incomes of at least $100,000.[64] Worship[edit] The session of the local congregation has a great deal of freedom in the style and ordering of worship within the guidelines set forth in the Directory for Worship section of the Book of Order.[65] Worship varies from congregation to congregation. The order may be very traditional and highly liturgical, or it may be very simple and informal. This variance is not unlike that seen in the ""High Church"" and ""Low Church"" styles of the Anglican Church. The Book of Order suggests a worship service ordered around five themes: ""gathering around the Word, proclaiming the Word, responding to the Word, the sealing of the Word, and bearing and following the Word into the world."" Prayer is central to the service and may be silent, spoken, sung, or read in unison (including The Lord's Prayer). Music plays a large role in most PC(USA) worship services and ranges from chant to traditional Protestant hymns, to classical sacred music, to more modern music, depending on the preference of the individual church and is offered prayerfully and not ""for entertainment or artistic display."" Scripture is read and usually preached upon. An offering is usually taken.[66] The pastor has certain responsibilities which are not subject to the authority of the session. In a particular service of worship the pastor is responsible for: the selection of Scripture lessons to be read, the preparation and preaching of the sermon or exposition of the Bible, the prayers offered on behalf of the people and those prepared for the use of the people in worship, the music to be sung, the use of drama, dance, and other art forms. The pastor may confer with a worship committee in planning particular services of worship.— [W-1.4005] The Directory for Worship in the Book of Order provides the directions for what must be, or may be included in worship. During the 20th century, Presbyterians were offered optional use of liturgical books: The Book of Common Worship of 1906 The Book of Common Worship of 1932 The Book of Common Worship of 1946 The Worshipbook of 1970 (spelling is correct) The Book of Common Worship of 1993 For more information, see Liturgical book of the Presbyterian Church (USA) In regard to vestments, the Directory for Worship leaves that decision up to the ministers. Thus, on a given Sunday morning service, a congregation may see the minister leading worship in street clothes, Geneva gown, or an alb. Among the Paleo-orthodoxy and emerging church Presbyterians, clergy are moving away from the traditional black Geneva gown and reclaiming not only the more ancient Eucharist vestments of alb and chasuble, but also cassock and surplice (typically a full length Old English style surplice which resembles the Celtic alb, an ungirdled liturgical tunic of the old Gallican Rite). The Service for the Lord's Day[edit] The Service for the Lord's Day is the name given to the general format or ordering of worship in the Presbyterian Church as outlined in its Constitution's Book of Order. There is a great deal of liberty given toward worship in that denomination, so while the underlying order and components for the Service for the Lord's Day is extremely common, it varies from congregation to congregation, region to region. Typical Presbyterian Church USA Order of Worship would look like this. This is taken from Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church, NYC Order of Worship | Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church The creation of the Service for the Lord's Day was one of the most positive contributions of the Worshipbook of 1970. The Book of Common Worship of 1993 leaned heavily upon this service. Influence[edit] Presbyterians are among the wealthiest religious groups and are disproportionately represented in American business, law, and politics.[67][68][58] Many Presbyterians have been Presidents, the latest being Ronald Reagan;[69] and they represent 13% of the U.S. Senate, despite being only 2.2% of the general population.[70] Missions[edit] The Presbyterian Church (USA) has, in the past, been a leading United States denomination in mission work, and many hospitals, clinics, colleges and universities worldwide trace their origins to the pioneering work of Presbyterian missionaries who founded them more than a century ago. Currently, the church supports about 215 missionaries abroad annually.[71] Many churches sponsor missionaries abroad at the session level, and these are not included in official statistics. A vital part of the world mission emphasis of the denomination is building and maintaining relationships with Presbyterian, Reformed and other churches around the world, even if this is not usually considered missions. The PC(USA) is a leader in disaster assistance relief and also participates in or relates to work in other countries through ecumenical relationships, in what is usually considered not missions, but deaconship. Ecumenical relationships and full communion partnerships[edit] The General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church (USA) determines and approves ecumenical statements, agreements, and maintains correspondence with other Presbyterian and Reformed bodies, other Christians churches, alliances, councils, and consortia. Ecumenical statements and agreements are subject to the ratification of the presbyteries. The following are some of the major ecumenical agreements and partnerships. The church is committed to ""engage in bilateral and multilateral dialogues with other churches and traditions in order to remove barriers of misunderstanding and establish common affirmations.""[72] As of 2012 it is in dialog with the Episcopal Church, the Moravian Church, the Korean Presbyterian Church in America, the Cumberland Presbyterian Church, the Cumberland Presbyterian Church in America, and the US Conference of Catholic Bishops. It also participates in international dialogues through the World Council of Churches and the World Communion of Reformed Churches. The most recent international dialogues include Pentecostal churches, the Seventh-day Adventist Church, Orthodox Church in America, and others. In 2011 the National Presbyterian Church in Mexico, in 2012 the Mizoram Presbyterian Church[73] and in 2015 the Independent Presbyterian Church of Brazil along with the Evangelical Presbyterian and Reformed Church in Peru severed ties with the PCUSA because of the PCUSA's teaching with regard to homosexuality.[74] National and international ecumenical memberships[edit] The Presbyterian Church (USA) is in corresponding partnership with the National Council of Churches, the World Communion of Reformed Churches,[75] and the World Council of Churches. It is a member of Churches for Middle East Peace. Formula of agreement[edit] Old Whaler's Church (Sag Harbor) In 1997 the PCUSA and three other churches of Reformation heritage: the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the Reformed Church in America and the United Church of Christ, acted on an ecumenical proposal of historic importance, known as A Formula of Agreement. The timing reflected a doctrinal consensus which had been developing over the past thirty-two years coupled with an increasing urgency for the church to proclaim a gospel of unity in contemporary society. In light of identified doctrinal consensus, desiring to bear visible witness to the unity of the Church, and hearing the call to engage together in God's mission, it was recommended: That the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the Presbyterian Church (USA), the Reformed Church in America, and the United Church of Christ declare on the basis of A Common Calling and their adoption of this A Formula of Agreement that they are in full communion with one another. Thus, each church is entering into or affirming full communion with three other churches.[76] The term ""full communion"" is understood here to specifically mean that the four churches: recognize each other as churches in which the gospel is rightly preached and the sacraments rightly administered according to the Word of God; withdraw any historic condemnation by one side or the other as inappropriate for the life and faith of our churches today; continue to recognize each other's Baptism and authorize and encourage the sharing of the Lord's Supper among their members; recognize each other's various ministries and make provision for the orderly exchange of ordained ministers of Word and Sacrament; establish appropriate channels of consultation and decision-making within the existing structures of the churches; commit themselves to an ongoing process of theological dialogue in order to clarify further the common understanding of the faith and foster its common expression in evangelism, witness, and service; pledge themselves to living together under the Gospel in such a way that the principle of mutual affirmation and admonition becomes the basis of a trusting relationship in which respect and love for the other will have a chance to grow. The agreement assumed the doctrinal consensus articulated in A Common Calling:The Witness of Our Reformation Churches in North America Today, and is to be viewed in concert with that document. The purpose of A Formula of Agreement is to elucidate the complementarity of affirmation and admonition as the basic principle of entering into full communion and the implications of that action as described in A Common Calling. The 209th General Assembly (1997) approved A Formula of Agreement and in 1998 the 210th General Assembly declared full communion among these Protestant bodies. National and international ecumenical memberships[edit] The Presbyterian Church (USA) is in corresponding partnership with the National Council of Churches, the World Communion of Reformed Churches,[77] Christian Churches Together, and the World Council of Churches. World Communion of Reformed Churches[edit] As of June 2010, the World Alliance of Reformed Churches merged with the Reformed Ecumenical Council to form the World Communion of Reformed Churches. The result was a form of full communion similar to that outline in the Formula of Agreement, including orderly exchange of ministers. Churches Uniting in Christ[edit] The PC(USA) is one of nine denominations that joined together to form the Consultation on Church Union, which initially sought a merger of the denominations. In 1998 the Seventh Plenary of the Consultation on Church Union approved a document ""Churches in Covenant Communion: The Church of Christ Uniting"" as a plan for the formation of a covenant communion of churches. In 2002 the nine denominations inaugurated the new relationship and became known as Churches Uniting in Christ. The partnership is considered incomplete until the partnering communions reconcile their understanding of ordination and devise an orderly exchange of clergy. Current controversies[edit] Homosexuality[edit] Main article: Homosexuality and Presbyterianism Paragraph G-6.0106b of the Book of Order, which was adopted in 1996, prohibited the ordination of those who were not faithful in heterosexual marriage or chaste in singleness. This paragraph was included in the Book of Order from 1997 to 2011, and was commonly referred to by its pre-ratification designation, ""Amendment B"".[78] Several attempts were made to remove this from the Book of Order, ultimately culminating in its removal in 2011. In 2011, the Presbyteries of the PC(USA) passed Amendment 10-A permitting congregations to ordain openly gay and lesbian elders and deacons, and allowing presbyteries to ordain ministers without reference to the fidelity/chastity provision, saying ""governing bodies shall be guided by Scripture and the confessions in applying standards to individual candidates"".[79] Many Presbyterian scholars, pastors, and theologians have been heavily involved in the debate over homosexuality over the years. The Presbyterian Church of India's cooperation with the Presbyterian Church (USA) was dissolved in 2012 when the PC(USA) voted to ordain openly gay clergy to the ministry.[80] In 2012, the PC(USA) granted permission, nationally, to begin ordaining openly gay and lesbian clergy.[81] Since 1980, the More Light Churches Network has served many congregations and individuals within American Presbyterianism who promote the full participation of all people in the PC(USA) regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. The Covenant Network of Presbyterians was formed in 1997 to support repeal of ""Amendment B"" and to encourage networking amongst like-minded clergy and congregations.[82] Other organizations of Presbyterians, such as the Confessing Movement and the Alliance of Confessing Evangelicals, have organized on the other side of the issue to support the fidelity/chastity standard for ordination, which was removed in 2011. The Presbyterian Church (USA) voted to allow same-sex marriages on June 19, 2014 during its 221st General Assembly, making it one of the largest Christian denominations in the world to allow same-sex unions. This vote lifted a previous ban, and allows pastors to perform marriages in jurisdictions where it is legal. Additionally, the Assembly approved amending the Book of Order that would change the definition of marriage from ""between a man and a woman"" to ""between two people, traditionally between a man and a woman"". General Assembly 2006[edit] The 2006 Report of the Theological Task Force on Peace, Unity, and Purity of the Church,[83] in theory, attempted to find common ground. Some felt that the adoption of this report provided for a clear local option mentioned, while the Stated Clerk of the General Assembly, Clifton Kirkpatrick went on record as saying, ""Our standards have not changed. The rules of the Book of Order stay in force and all ordinations are still subject to review by higher governing bodies."" The authors of the report stated that it is a compromise and return to the original Presbyterian culture of local controls. The recommendation for more control by local presbyteries and sessions is viewed by its opposition as a method for bypassing the constitutional restrictions currently in place concerning ordination and marriage, effectively making the constitutional ""standard"" entirely subjective. In the General Assembly gathering of June 2006, Presbyterian voting Commissioners passed an ""authoritative interpretation"", recommended by the Theological Task Force, of the Book of Order (the church constitution). Some argued that this gave presbyteries the ""local option"" of ordaining or not ordaining anyone based on a particular presbytery's reading of the constitutional statute. Others argued that presbyteries have always had this responsibility and that this new ruling did not change but only clarified that responsibility. On June 20, 2006, the General Assembly voted 298 to 221 (or 57% to 43%) to approve such interpretation. In that same session on June 20, the General Assembly also voted 405 to 92 (with 4 abstentions) to uphold the constitutional standard for ordination requiring fidelity in marriage or chastity in singleness. General Assembly 2008[edit] The General Assembly of 2008 took several actions related to homosexuality. The first action was to adopt a different translation of the Heidelberg Catechism from 1962, removing the words ""homosexual perversions"" among other changes. This will require the approval of the 2010 and 2012 General Assemblies as well as the votes of the presbyteries after the 2010 Assembly.[needs update][84] The second action was to approve a new Authoritative Interpretation of G-6.0108 of the Book of Order allowing for the ordaining body to make decisions on whether or not a departure from the standards of belief of practice is sufficient to preclude ordination.[85] Some argue that this creates ""local option"" on ordaining homosexual persons. The third action was to replace the text of ""Amendment B"" with new text: ""Those who are called to ordained service in the church, by their assent to the constitutional questions for ordination and installation (W-4.4003), pledge themselves to live lives obedient to Jesus Christ the Head of the Church, striving to follow where he leads through the witness of the Scriptures, and to understand the Scriptures through the instruction of the Confessions. In so doing, they declare their fidelity to the standards of the Church. Each governing body charged with examination for ordination and/or installation (G-14.0240 and G-14.0450) establishes the candidate's sincere efforts to adhere to these standards.""[86] This would have removed the ""fidelity and chastity"" clause. This third action failed to obtain the required approval of a majority of the presbyteries by June 2009. Fourth, a resolution was adopted to affirm the definition of marriage from Scripture and the Confessions as being between a man and a woman.[87] General Assembly 2010[edit] In July 2010, by a vote of 373 to 323, the General Assembly voted to propose to the presbyteries for ratification a constitutional amendment to remove from the Book of Order section G-6.0106.b. which included this explicit requirement for ordination: ""Among these standards is the requirement to live either in fidelity within the covenant of marriage between a man and a woman (W-4.9001), or chastity in singleness."" This proposal required ratification by a majority of the 173 presbyteries within 12 months of the General Assembly's adjournment.[88][89] A majority of presbytery votes was reached in May 2011. The constitutional amendment took effect July 10, 2011.[90] This amendment shifted back to the ordaining body the responsibility for making decisions about whom they shall ordain and what they shall require of their candidates for ordination. It neither prevents nor imposes the use of the so-called ""fidelity and chastity"" requirement, but it removes that decision from the text of the constitution and places that judgment responsibility back upon the ordaining body where it had traditionally been prior to the insertion of the former G-6.0106.b. in 1997. Each ordaining body, the session for deacon or elder and the presbytery for minister, is now responsible to make its own interpretation of what scripture and the confessions require of ordained officers. General Assembly 2014[edit] In June 2014, the General Assembly approved a change in the wording of its constitution to define marriage a contract ""between a woman and a man"" to being ""between two people, traditionally a man and a woman"". It allowed gay and lesbian weddings within the church and further allow clergy to perform same-sex weddings. That revision gave clergy the choice of presiding over same-sex marriages, but clergy was not compelled to perform same-sex marriage. Property ownership[edit] PC(USA)'s book of order includes a ""trust clause"", which grants ownership of church property to the presbytery. Under this trust clause, the presbytery may assert a claim to the property of the congregation in the event of a congregational split, dissolution (closing), or disassociation from the PC(USA). This clause does not prevent particular churches from leaving the denomination, but if they do, they may not be entitled to any physical assets of that congregation unless by agreement with the presbytery. Recently this provision has been vigorously tested in courts of law. Israeli–Palestinian conflict[edit] Main article: Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) disinvestment from Israel controversy See also: Disinvestment from Israel In June 2004, the General Assembly met in Richmond, Virginia, and adopted by a vote of 431–62 a resolution that called on the church's committee on Mission Responsibility through Investment (MRTI) ""to initiate a process of phased, selective divestment in multinational corporations operating in Israel"". The resolution also said ""the occupation ... has proven to be at the root of evil acts committed against innocent people on both sides of the conflict"".[91] The church statement at the time noted that ""divestment is one of the strategies that U.S. churches used in the 1970s and 80s in a successful campaign to end apartheid in South Africa"". A second resolution, calling for an end to the construction of a wall by the state of Israel, passed.[92] The resolution opposed to the construction of the Israeli West Bank barrier, regardless of its location, and opposed the United States government making monetary contribution to the construction. The General Assembly also adopted policies rejecting Christian Zionism and allowing the continued funding of conversionary activities aimed at Jews. Together, the resolutions caused tremendous dissent within the church and a sharp disconnect with the Jewish community. Leaders of several American Jewish groups communicated to the church their concerns about the use of economic leverages that apply specifically to companies operating in Israel.[93] Some critics of the divestment policy accused church leaders of anti-Semitism.[94][95][96] In June 2006, after the General Assembly in Birmingham, Alabama changed policy (details), both pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian groups praised the resolution. Pro-Israel groups, who had written General Assembly commissioners to express their concerns about a corporate engagement/divestment strategy focused on Israel,[97] praised the new resolution, saying that it reflected the church stepping back from a policy that singled out companies working in Israel.[98] Pro-Palestinian groups said that the church maintained the opportunity to engage and potentially divest from companies that support the Israeli occupation, because such support would be considered inappropriate according to the customary MRTI process. In August 2011, the American National Middle Eastern Presbyterian Caucus (NMEPC) endorsed the boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS) campaign against Israel.[99] In January 2014, The PC(USA) published ""Zionism unsettled"", which was commended as ""a valuable opportunity to explore the political ideology of Zionism"".[100] One critic claimed it was anti-Zionist and characterised the Israeli–Palestinian as a conflict fueled by a ""pathology inherent in Zionism"".[101] The Simon Wiesenthal Center described the study guide as ""a hit-piece outside all norms of interfaith dialogue. It is a compendium of distortions, ignorance and outright lies – that tragically has emanated too often from elites within this church"".[102] The PC(USA) subsequently withdrew the publication from sale on its website.[103] On June 20, 2014 the General Assembly in Detroit approved a measure (310–303) calling for divestment from stock in Caterpillar, Hewlett-Packard and Motorola Solutions in protest of Israeli policies on the West Bank. The vote was immediately and sharply criticized by the American Jewish Committee which accused the General Assembly of acting out of anti-Semitic motives. Proponents of the measure strongly denied the accusations.[104] List of notable congregations[edit] Independent Presbyterian Church in Birmingham, Alabama[105] Bel Air Presbyterian Church in Bel Air, California Brick Presbyterian Church (New York City) Church of the Covenant (Boston) Church of the Pilgrims (Washington DC) the Cathedral of Hope (Pittsburgh), also known as East Liberty Presbyterian Church[106] Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church (Manhattan) First Presbyterian Church (Charlotte, North Carolina)[107] First Presbyterian Church (Manhattan) First Presbyterian Church (Nashville, Tennessee) First Presbyterian Church (Springfield, Illinois) Fort Street Presbyterian Church (Detroit, Michigan) Fort Washington Presbyterian Church Fourth Presbyterian Church (Chicago) Highland Presbyterian Church (Kentucky) Idlewild Presbyterian Church in Memphis, Tennessee Kirk in the Hills (Bloomfield Township, Oakland County) Lincoln Park Presbyterian Church (Lincoln Park, Michigan) Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church (New York City) Myers Park Presbyterian Church (Charlotte, North Carolina) National Presbyterian Church (Washington, District of Columbia) Old Pine Street Church (Philadelphia) Peachtree Presbyterian Church (Atlanta) Rutgers Presbyterian Church (New York City) Second Presbyterian Church (Indianapolis, Indiana) Shadyside Presbyterian Church in Pittsburgh University Presbyterian Church (Seattle, Washington) Village Presbyterian Church (Prairie Village, Kansas) Westminster Presbyterian Church (Los Angeles) Westminster Presbyterian Church (Minneapolis) West-Park Presbyterian Church (Manhattan) Woods Memorial Presbyterian Church (Severna Park, Maryland) See also[edit] United States portal Calvinism portal Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church Association of Presbyterian Colleges and Universities Churches Uniting in Christ Cumberland Presbyterian Church Evangelical Presbyterian Church (United States) Ghost Ranch Ordination exams Orthodox Presbyterian Church Presbyterian Church in America Presbyterian Church (USA) Hezbollah controversy Presbyterian Youth Connection Reformed Churches in North America Religion in Louisville, Kentucky Protestantism in the United States Christianity in the United States Category:American Presbyterians References[edit] ^ a b c d Church (U.S.A.), Presbyterian (April 24, 2021).

In implementing these principles, signatories contribute to the development of a more sustainable global financial system. The Principles offer a menu of possible actions for incorporating environmental, social and corporate governance issues into investment practices across asset classes. Responsible investment is a process that must be tailored to fit each organisation's investment strategy, approach and resources. The Principles are designed to be compatible with the investment styles of large, diversified, institutional investors that operate within a traditional fiduciary framework. As of August 2017, more than 1,750 signatories from over 50 countries representing approximately US$70 trillion[2] have signed up to the Principles. In some cases, before retaining an investment manager, institutional investors will inquire as to whether the manager is a signatory.[3] Contents 1 General 1.1 About the PRI 1.2 The Principles for Responsible Investment 1.3 Partnership initiatives 2 Major projects 2.1 Fiduciary duty in the 21st century 2.2 ESG integration for equity investing 3 See also 4 References 5 External links General[edit] About the PRI[edit] In early 2005, the then UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, invited a group of the world’s largest institutional investors to join a process to develop the Principles for Responsible Investment. A 20-person investor group drawn from institutions in 12 countries was supported by a 70-person group of experts from the investment industry, intergovernmental organisations and civil society. The Principles were launched in April 2006 at the New York Stock Exchange. The Principles are based on the notion that environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, such as climate change and human rights, can affect the performance of investment portfolios and should therefore be considered alongside more traditional financial factors if investors are to properly fulfill their fiduciary duty. The six Principles provide a global framework for mainstream investors to consider these ESG issues. The PRI was created alongside the Principles to help put the framework into practice. The Principles saw increased sign-up following the global financial crisis of 2008–2009, according to a report in the Financial Times. The Principles are ‘voluntary and aspirational’ and they do not have minimum entry requirements or absolute performance standards for responsible investment. However, signatories have an obligation to report on the extent to which they implement the Principles through the annual Reporting and Assessment process. The PRI has around 90 staff based mostly in London, with offices in New York City, Seoul, Sao Paulo, Amsterdam, Tokyo and Cape Town. The Principles for Responsible Investment[edit] The six principles are as follows: As institutional investors, we have a duty to act in the best long-term interests of our beneficiaries. In this fiduciary role, we believe that environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) issues can affect the performance of investment portfolios (to varying degrees across companies, sectors, regions, asset classes and through time). We also recognise that applying these principles may better align investors with broader objectives of society. Therefore, where consistent with our fiduciary responsibilities, we commit to the following: Unveiling of the PRI at the New York Stock Exchange in 2006, attended by founding PRI signatories and the former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan 1. We will incorporate ESG issues into investment analysis and decision-making processes. 2. We will be active owners and incorporate ESG issues into our ownership policies and practices. 3. We will seek appropriate disclosure on ESG issues by the entities in which we invest. 4. We will promote acceptance and implementation of the Principles within the investment industry. 5. We will work together to enhance our effectiveness in implementing the Principles. 6. We will each report on our activities and progress towards implementing the Principles. Partnership initiatives[edit] The PRI is a founding member of the United Nations Sustainable Stock Exchanges (SSE) initiative along with the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP-FI), and the UN Global Compact. Major projects[edit] Fiduciary duty in the 21st century[edit] A report published by the PRI (with UNEP FI, UNEP Inquiry and the UN Global Compact) found that fiduciary duty is not an obstacle to asset owner action on ESG factors. Fiduciary duty in the 21st century[4] looked at fiduciary duty across eight markets (US, Canada, UK, Germany, Brazil, Australia, Japan and South Africa) through a series of events, interviews, case studies and a legal review. Fiduciary duty has long been a contentious issue, especially in the US. Asset managers and advisers have often cited fiduciary duty as a reason for not incorporating ESG factors into the investment decision-making process, claiming that looking at non-financial indicators was not consistent with their fiduciary duty. The report found that many investors have yet to fully integrate ESG issues into their investment decision making processes. Some of the reasons for this include outdated perceptions about fiduciary duty and long-term responsible investment. ESG integration for equity investing[edit] The PRI launched a guide[5] to help investors - both asset owners and investment managers - who are implementing ESG integration techniques in their investment process. It is the most comprehensive description to date of what ESG-integrated analysis is, and how it works in practice. The guide contains information and case studies on integration techniques that apply to investment strategies including fundamental, quantitative, smart beta and passive investment. It assists asset owners and investment managers with constructing ESG-integrated investment processes and helps asset owners to assess their managers' integration practices. A chapter on sell-side investment research maps out the types of ESG-integrated research available, and demonstrates brokers' integration techniques.

The Principles are based on the notion that environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, such as climate change and human rights, can affect the performance of investment portfolios and should therefore be considered alongside more traditional financial factors if investors are to properly fulfill their fiduciary duty. The six Principles provide a global framework for mainstream investors to consider these ESG issues. The PRI was created alongside the Principles to help put the framework into practice. The Principles saw increased sign-up following the global financial crisis of 2008–2009, according to a report in the Financial Times. The Principles are ‘voluntary and aspirational’ and they do not have minimum entry requirements or absolute performance standards for responsible investment. However, signatories have an obligation to report on the extent to which they implement the Principles through the annual Reporting and Assessment process. The PRI has around 90 staff based mostly in London, with offices in New York City, Seoul, Sao Paulo, Amsterdam, Tokyo and Cape Town. The Principles for Responsible Investment[edit] The six principles are as follows: As institutional investors, we have a duty to act in the best long-term interests of our beneficiaries. In this fiduciary role, we believe that environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) issues can affect the performance of investment portfolios (to varying degrees across companies, sectors, regions, asset classes and through time). We also recognise that applying these principles may better align investors with broader objectives of society. Therefore, where consistent with our fiduciary responsibilities, we commit to the following: Unveiling of the PRI at the New York Stock Exchange in 2006, attended by founding PRI signatories and the former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan 1. We will incorporate ESG issues into investment analysis and decision-making processes. 2. We will be active owners and incorporate ESG issues into our ownership policies and practices. 3. We will seek appropriate disclosure on ESG issues by the entities in which we invest. 4. We will promote acceptance and implementation of the Principles within the investment industry. 5. We will work together to enhance our effectiveness in implementing the Principles. 6. We will each report on our activities and progress towards implementing the Principles. Partnership initiatives[edit] The PRI is a founding member of the United Nations Sustainable Stock Exchanges (SSE) initiative along with the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP-FI), and the UN Global Compact. Major projects[edit] Fiduciary duty in the 21st century[edit] A report published by the PRI (with UNEP FI, UNEP Inquiry and the UN Global Compact) found that fiduciary duty is not an obstacle to asset owner action on ESG factors. Fiduciary duty in the 21st century[4] looked at fiduciary duty across eight markets (US, Canada, UK, Germany, Brazil, Australia, Japan and South Africa) through a series of events, interviews, case studies and a legal review. Fiduciary duty has long been a contentious issue, especially in the US. Asset managers and advisers have often cited fiduciary duty as a reason for not incorporating ESG factors into the investment decision-making process, claiming that looking at non-financial indicators was not consistent with their fiduciary duty. The report found that many investors have yet to fully integrate ESG issues into their investment decision making processes. Some of the reasons for this include outdated perceptions about fiduciary duty and long-term responsible investment. ESG integration for equity investing[edit] The PRI launched a guide[5] to help investors - both asset owners and investment managers - who are implementing ESG integration techniques in their investment process. It is the most comprehensive description to date of what ESG-integrated analysis is, and how it works in practice. The guide contains information and case studies on integration techniques that apply to investment strategies including fundamental, quantitative, smart beta and passive investment. It assists asset owners and investment managers with constructing ESG-integrated investment processes and helps asset owners to assess their managers' integration practices. A chapter on sell-side investment research maps out the types of ESG-integrated research available, and demonstrates brokers' integration techniques.

Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. Please help improve this article by introducing citations to additional sources.Find sources: ""Principles for Responsible Investment"" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR (June 2020) Logo of the Principles for Responsible Investment initiative Principles for Responsible Investment (UNPRI or PRI)[1] is a United Nations-supported international network of investors working together to implement its six aspirational principles, often referenced as ""the Principles"".[1] Its goal is to understand the implications of sustainability for investors and support signatories to facilitate incorporating these issues into their investment decision-making and ownership practices. In implementing these principles, signatories contribute to the development of a more sustainable global financial system. The Principles offer a menu of possible actions for incorporating environmental, social and corporate governance issues into investment practices across asset classes. Responsible investment is a process that must be tailored to fit each organisation's investment strategy, approach and resources. The Principles are designed to be compatible with the investment styles of large, diversified, institutional investors that operate within a traditional fiduciary framework. As of August 2017, more than 1,750 signatories from over 50 countries representing approximately US$70 trillion[2] have signed up to the Principles. In some cases, before retaining an investment manager, institutional investors will inquire as to whether the manager is a signatory.[3] Contents 1 General 1.1 About the PRI 1.2 The Principles for Responsible Investment 1.3 Partnership initiatives 2 Major projects 2.1 Fiduciary duty in the 21st century 2.2 ESG integration for equity investing 3 See also 4 References 5 External links General[edit] About the PRI[edit] In early 2005, the then UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, invited a group of the world’s largest institutional investors to join a process to develop the Principles for Responsible Investment.

An initial two-year program will take place in Africa, where marine and terrestrial operations will focus on the most threatened biodiversity hotspots in Madagascar and Mozambique. A series of terrestrial and marine expeditions will be conducted to complete a detailed biodiversity survey focusing on both the richest and the least well-known species. The survey will involve 150 to 200 international scientists and technicians on different expeditions over the course of five months. Pro-Natura International is a non-governmental organization that specializes in sustainable development. Its efforts focus on the social, economic and environmental problems facing rural communities in Southern hemisphere countries. Pro-Natura seeks to mobilize groups of experts, international programs and institutions concerned with two major current environmental issues: preservation of biodiversity and climate change.

Pro Natura was created as a contribution to solving these problems and attacking its cause – inconsequential economic development. History Over the last 35+ years, Pro Natura has operated in some of the most severely challenged environments in 50+ countries – consistently producing significant and lasting results in every territory it has engaged with. Our strategy and actions consist of systemically stimulate environmentally sound, socially just and inclusive economic development in sensitive and underprivileged regions around the world. Later, this approach would be known as Sustainability, making Pro Natura one of the pioneers of the area in the world. Along the way, we have been honored to be the recipient of the United Nations Leader in Sustainability Award, Mitchell International Award, and the World Petroleum Congress Award for Excellence in Social Responsibility, amongst many others.

Inadequate and improper forest management practices are threatening the long-term viability of many forests. This reduces their economic potential significantly, resulting in negative social and environmental impacts. Public awareness and the demand for certified timber products is growing, and Forest Management Certification gives the necessary reassurance that timber products originating from a forest are managed in a responsible and sustainable way. Forest managers and forest owners who choose to ignore the sustainability issue are becoming very vulnerable. Their over-exploitation leads to a serious depletion of natural resources and increased public criticism. That is why more and more managers and owners are looking to Forest Management Certification.How you benefitManufacturers and suppliers who want to guarantee that their timber products originate from a certified forest, and who want to pass this guarantee onto the end user, need to provide proof of the origin. This is accomplished by way of Chain Of Custody Certification.Control Union Certifications (CUC) is an independent certification body that carries out inspections, audits, verifications and awards certificates for the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), the PEFC Council (Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes), Keurhout and the EU Timber Regulation (EU TR). We have a global network of offices in more than 60 countries.

History In 1999, small- and family forest owners from Europe came together to create a forest certification system that would enable them to demonstrate their excellence in sustainable forest management. 20 years on, PEFC is the largest forest certification system in the world! Home Discover PEFCWhat is PEFC?History History PEFC was founded in 1999 in response to the specific requirements of small- and family forest owners as an international umbrella organization providing independent assessment, endorsement and recognition of national forest certification systems.PEFC responded to the need for a mechanism enabling the independent development of national standards tailored to the political, economic, social, environmental and cultural realities of the respective countries, while at the same time ensuring compliance with internationally-accepted requirements and global recognition.After our establishment on 30 June 1999 in Paris, France, the first forest owners were able to achieve PEFC certification in 2000, as we endorsed the first national forest certification systems (in Finland, Sweden, Norway, Germany and Austria). Two years later, in 2002, we published the first PEFC Chain of Custody guidelines, enabling the appearance of PEFC-certified products on the market.After the successful endorsement of certification systems in Europe, in 2004 Australia and Chile became the first non-European national standards to be endorsed. This meant it was time to change our name: no longer Pan European Forest Certification, but now the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification.The next few years saw rapid levels of growth, as we hit 100 million hectares of PEFC-certified forest area in 2005 and then 200 million hectares in 2008. The same year we also moved our international headquarters from Luxembourg to Geneva, Switzerland, in order to be closer to our international stakeholders in the UN, non-governmental organizations and other partners.In 2009, we expanded into two more continents, as the first African (Gabon) and Asian (Malaysia) national forest certification systems achieved endorsement, both in tropical countries.We became the first global forest certification system to introduce social aspects in chain of custody certification in 2010, and a few years later in 2013, our Chain of Custody standard was aligned with the European Union Timber Regulation (EUTR). The following year we reached the milestone of 10,000 PEFC chain of custody certified companies.Recent years have seen us continue to grow. In 2016, we hit 300 million hectares of PEFC-certified forest area, and by 2018 there were PEFC endorsed national forest certification systems in 40 countries around the world.We also continue to innovate. We published the latest edition of our sustainable forest management benchmark standard in 2018, extending the impact of PEFC certification beyond forests and enhancing our contribution to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In 2020, we published the revised versions of three vital international standards governing chain of custody certification, trademark use, and conformity assessment.In between, 2019 saw us reach our 20th anniversary, celebrating this milestone with our 20 years of caring campaign. We told the story of PEFC's beginnings, growth and development, present and future through a range of articles, photos and videos. Check out the overview of the campaign, and discover a little more about PEFC! Smallholders at our heart, forever In the 20 years since we were created, we have continually strengthened our approach. An approach that has been adopted by increasing numbers of stakeholders, making PEFC today the world's largest forest certification system. But while we continue to grow, we have never forgotten our roots.

Since government regulations and intergovernmental mechanisms are not found to be the effective solutions for such problems, voluntary sustainability standards (VSS) have been introduced as an alternative solution. This chapter examines the role of one such VSS—the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC)—in Indonesia. In particular, it attempts to answer two questions. First, does the PEFC complement or substitute government regulations and other VSS under the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)? Second, what is the role envisioned for the PEFC in creating sustainable forest management in Indonesia? Interviews with stakeholders and an analysis of the documents of PEFC, FSC, and government regulations called Sustainable Forest Production Management (PHPL) suggest that PEFC seems to complement government regulations but substitute FSC. Although the PEFC is likely to be widely applied in the country, it is unlikely to emerge as an effective tool to achieve sustainable forest management. Of the two main reasons for this, the first is the lack of support from government and civil society. While the government clearly prioritizes the standard developed by it—the Indonesian Ecolabelling Institute (LEI)—within the civil society, several NGOs are not supportive of voluntary certification. Second, the absence of global and national legitimacy weakens the enforcement role of PEFC.KeywordsProgramme for the endorsement of forest certification (PEFC) Sustainable forest management (SFM) Indonesia Forest stewardship council (FSC) Voluntary sustainability standards (VSS)  Download chapter PDF1 IntroductionIndonesia has an extensive tropical forest, which accounts for almost half of its land. This signifies not only plentiful resources but also numerous problems such as forest fires, deforestation and illegal logging. Although the government has put in place several regulations to address them, these problems persist. Effort was also taken at the international level, with the international community offering an internationally-recognized, private certification to companies practicing sustainable forest management (SFM). Since the effort is initiated by a private agent, this certification is voluntary. The International Trade Centre (ITC, 2012) reports that there are 17 types of voluntary standards that have been implemented in many countries with many types of products certified. In forest management, so far, there have been two internationally-recognized voluntary sustainability standards (VSS) which can be obtained by any forest concession holder in Indonesia—Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC).VSS, or private voluntary standards (PVS), emerged at a time when inter-state negotiations on collective action for social and environmental concerns had reached a deadlock. Private actors, namely multinational corporations (MNCs) and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) came up with some agreement over good social and environmental practices, known as sustainability standards (Djama, 2011). In many cases, VSS are seen as a more effective way to enforce sustainable practices amongst the producers than government regulations (Hagen & Alvarez, 2011; Djama, 2011). Thus, VSS are deemed to weaken governments’ role. In terms of actual practice, private and public standards are often seen as duplicating, but sometimes, complementing each other (Hagen & Alvarez, 2011). Multiple standards may be harmful for producers due to the larger compliance cost (Hagen & Alvarez, 2011; Ruslandi, Klassen, Romero, & Putz, 2014).This chapter investigates whether PEFC complements the mandatory standard as well as the FSC, and whether it plays an important role for sustainability practices in the Indonesian forest industry. We focus on PEFC since little attention has so far been given to this standard. FSC, which was introduced in Indonesia in the 1990s, has received much more attention (Ruslandi et al., 2014; Romero et al., 2015). This chapter further aims to analyse whether PEFC  is likely to be widely applied in Indonesia and thus help address the forest management problems in the country. This research is based on interviews conducted with a forestry research institution, an Indonesian association of forest concession holders—Indonesian Forestry Certification Cooperation (IFCC) (through which PEFC was introduced in Indonesia) and a certification body. In addition, this research is based on an analysis of documents of PEFC, FSC and of the public mandatory standard, Sustainable Forest Production Management (PHPL).This chapter proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes forest management problems in Indonesia and a series of government regulations addressing these problems. Section 3 reviews a number of standards existing in the country both in the past and in the present, and discusses whether the PEFC fills in for what was lacking in the PHPL, SVLK (Timber Legality Assurance System), and FSC. Section 4 explores several features indicating PEFC’s acceptability in Indonesia and its role in contributing to SFM in the country. Section 5 provides a conclusion on whether PEFC is likely to be widely applied in Indonesia to help remedy the unsustainable practices in Indonesian forestry.2 Forest Management in IndonesiaIndonesia has an extraordinary biodiversity and huge size of tropical forest. In accordance with Act No. 41/1999 on Forestry, forest area includes conservation forest, protection forest and production forest. Referring to the Forestry Statistics of Indonesia 2013, the total forest including inland water, and coastal and marine ecosystems accounted for 129.43 million hectares (MOEF, 2014) while later statistics (2017) placed the figure at 125.92 million hectares (MOEF 2018). However, Indonesia has been facing daunting challenges to protect and manage its forest resources due to its high rates of deforestation, illegal logging, social frictions over forest rights between the government and local communities, etc. The underlying sources of many, if not most, of these challenges rest on the confusion and disagreement over who should control or own Indonesia’s forests (Contreras & Fay, 2005). Research on land-use and remote sensing data reveals that significant forest areas are in fact community-planted agro-forests, agricultural lands and grasslands. The government, however, views them as natural forests or lands to be reforested for timber production, and this often results in conflicts (Contreras & Fay, 2005). Other serious challenges include forest fires and deforestation. The deforestation rate inside and outside forest areas in Indonesia remains high; for the period of 2011–12, it reached a figure of 613,480 ha per year (MOEF, 2014). Through tougher efforts, the government has succeeded in reducing the deforestation rate to 480,010 ha per year for the period of 2016–2017 (MOEF 2018).To respond to these challenges, the government has in fact launched several tough policies and efforts. Reinforcing the existing legal framework, the government passed the so-called lex specialis Act No. 18/2013 on the Deterring and Combating of Forest Deteriorating Actions. Partly, these policies aim at reinforcing previous progressive initiatives relating to the reduction of carbon emissions from the forest sector that was launched in October 2009 wherein Indonesia committed to reducing national emissions by 26%, or by as much as 41% against business-as-usual by 2020 with international support (G-20 Leaders Summit, September 2009). Apart from designing related policies to achieve this target, Indonesia embarked on two consecutive two-year moratoriums on forests and peat lands concessions. In 2011, the government issued a presidential decree on the national action plan to reduce GHG emissions. With the new administration, through midterm national development planning 2015–2019, the government embarked on a more ambitious policy route to upgrade SFM and conservation measures (Appendix I, Presidential Decree No. 2/2015). For the post 2020 period, the government envisions a progression beyond its existing commitment to emission reductions. Based on the country’s emissions level assessment, the government has set an unconditional reduction target of 29% and a conditional reduction target of up to 41% of the business-as-usual scenario by 2030 (UNFCCC, 2016).Forest management and conservation measures and policies have evolved dynamically over time and they have been determined by both societal values as well as socio-economic and political conditions. Making them work effectively is a serious challenge (Maryudi, 2015). In order to promote SFM in the light of the growing scepticism about the effectiveness of governmental policies and initiatives, and the perceived failure of a global intergovernmental mechanism to stop deforestation and forest degradation, voluntary certification schemes were seen as a viable alternative to sustain nationally existing mandatory policies and regulations (Maryudi, 2015; Van Bueren, 2010).3 Forest-Related Standards in IndonesiaForest certification is not new to Indonesia. The country has engaged with forest certification since 1990. Indonesia has its own national forest certification system, called Indonesia Ecolabelling Institute (LEI—Lembaga Ekolabel Indonesia), which was introduced in 1997. In 2000, this institute signed a Joint Certification Program (JCP) with the FSC (Muhtaman & Prasetyo, 2006). FSC certification, as an international certification system, has also been available in Indonesia for some years. In 2009, the government started the mandatory certification programmes—PHPL (Sustainable Production Forest Management) and SVLK (Timber Legality Assurance Scheme).PHPL was endorsed through several government regulations, i.e. Govt. Reg. No. 6/2007 junto No. 3/2008 on Forest Governance, the Establishment of Forest Management Plans and Forest Utilization, and MOEF Reg. No. 38/Menhut-II/2009 junto Permenhut P.68/Menhut-II/2011, junto Permenhut P.45/Menhut-II/2012, junto Permenhut P.42/Menhut-II/2013 on Standards and Guidelines for the Assessment of the Sustainability Performance of Production Forest Management and for Timber Legality Assurance for Concession Holders or People’s Forests (Nurtjahjawilasa, Duryat, Yasman, Septiani, & Lasmini, 2013). This programme aims to enforce the existing laws in order to ensure that forest management is subject to sustainability principles. Since this programme is a mandatory government instrument, it does not relate to the technical issue of trade of forest products and is not targeted at fulfilling market demands. The programme sets five basic criteria relating to the following aspects: (1) legality and security of forest resources; (2) product sustainability; (3) conservation, ecology and environment; (4) economic benefits and (5) institutions (Nurtjahjawilasa et al., 2013). To measure the degree to which PHPL is performed by a forest management unit, there is measurement guidance and standardization. This standardization and guidance are then used as instruments for the certification process by an independent assessor.SVLK is a mandatory tracking system, effective since 2009, which was developed by involving multistakeholders to ensure the legality of sources from which timber is being traded in Indonesia. The system seeks to improve forest management and to maintain the credibility and legality of Indonesian timber. It was eventually integrated into the PHPL programme. Pursuant to the Ministry of Trade’s Regulation No. 64 in 2012, there are 40 timber-based products obliged to obtain the SVLK certificate. The SVLK audit is performed by a certification body which has been certified by the National Accreditation Committee (KAN) to be a Timber Legality Verification Body (LV-LK) in line with MOEF’s Decree. This policy reflects the government’s commitment to fight illegal logging and illegal timber trading and to fulfil international market demand for certified legal timber—in particular from the European Union (EU), USA, Japan and Australia. This system can be seen as a “national incentive” to respond to the increasing demand for timber legality certification schemes from abroad, such as FSC and PEFC (Ministry of Environment and Forestry/MOEF, 2016). By the end of 2016, about 24 million hectares of forest and 2843 forest-based industries were SVLK certified (The Jakarta Post, 2016).Obtaining certification is not always easy, and there are several barriers that prevent or discourage voluntary certification in particular. Bartley (2010) and Ruslandi et al. (2014), in their study of FSC certification in Indonesia, point to a lack of market incentive as one of the barriers. The EU, as the most green-conscious market, is apparently not Indonesia’s largest export destination for timber and timber products. Another barrier is the high cost of achieving the standards required by FSC. To obtain the certificate, a concession has to pay audit fees, make infrastructure improvements and forgo the profits from unsustainable practices. From the five concession areas that Ruslandi et al. (2014) focus on in their research, the concessions needed time as long as from 3 to 10 years to get the FSC certificate. Another international voluntary certificate introduced in Indonesia is PEFC. The Indonesia Forest Certification Cooperation (IFCC), which introduced PEFC in Indonesia, was established in 2011, and the standards of PEFC Indonesia were endorsed in 2014. Comparison of PEFC, FSC and Government Regulations To get an idea of whether PEFC, FSC and government regulations are substitutable or complementary, the three standards are compared across seven forest management components. Each component is matched to its reference in PEFC and FSC principles, respectively (Table 1).Table 1Forest management components and their references to FSC and PEFC principlesForest management components used in this studyFSC principlesPEFC principlesCompliance with laws and satisfaction of financial obligations11Implementation of reduced-impact logging5, 6, 7, 82, 3, 4, 6Social impact assessment and community development programs3, 49, 10Environmental management and monitoring plans6, 82, 6, 3, 4Biodiversity conservation97Worker rights, health and safety411Yield sustainability and silviculture7, 8, 102, 3, 5, 8Source Columns 1 and 2 from Ruslandi et al.

In contrast to FSC, PEFC also requires an R&D plan.

It only mentions that the management plan has to include silviculture technique and that the harvest rate must not exceed the rate of sustainable productionSource Columns 1, 2, and 3 from Ruslandi et al. (2014); Column 4 authors’ elaborationWith regard to compliance with regulations and satisfaction of financial obligations, both PEFC and FSC strengthen government regulations. However, PEFC explicitly mentions that concessions have to comply with the SVLK—the public mandatory standard. This implies that in this regard, PEFC does not want to be contradictory to government regulations. In addition, PEFC has some additional requirements such as to identify an adequate infrastructure for delivery of goods and protection of ecosystem, and to carry out R&D activities. However, in general, PEFC has many similarities with FSC, e.g. concessions have to abide with national legislations, pay all of the financial obligations to the government, and state explicitly their commitment to SFM.As for the implementation of reduced-impact logging (RIL), the PEFC requirement is similar to that of FSC as it includes criteria, e.g. on tree felling, bucking and log yarding, as well as on soil and water protection functions. Since the implementation level of government regulations on RIL is low (Ruslandi et al., 2014), PEFC and FSC requirements on RIL strengthen government regulation.Regarding their environmental management and monitoring plan, PEFC requires concessions to provide documentation of measures relating to land use, forest protection functions and forest fire prevention. It also requires an R&D plan. In this regard, the PEFC requirement is in line with those of the government and FSC. However, the FSC requirement is more detailed than that of PEFC. For instance, FSC lists examples of particular activities that have to be mentioned in the evaluation report if those activities are to be conducted by concessions in future. FSC also requires concessions to include particular measures such as water flow management in their plan.Biodiversity conservation and protection: Compared to governmental regulations and FSC, the PEFC scheme has set at least two important emphases: (1) the importance of not only maintaining the (key) protected flora and fauna, endemic, rare and threatened/endangered species and their habitats in accordance with the national regulations and international conventions but also repairing their habitat and features of special biological interests and (2) the obligation to carry out the environmental impact assessment (EIA) indicated in point (1) and to incorporate measures to mitigate those impacts and disruptions.In the framework of forest management components, the PEFC requirements reinforce the existing ones and provide more comprehensive parameters compared to government regulations, i.e. the mandatory PHPL, and also compared to the existing voluntary certification scheme, the FSC. For the government, this is quite important because there are no explicit regulations that require biodiversity protection and conservation at the concession unit level, nor in the framework of the national legislation agenda to amend the specific law concerning biodiversity (Act No. 5/1990) (Prolegnas, 2015; Ruslandi et al., 2014).Social impacts and community development: Compared to the mandatory PHPL and the FSC, the PEFC provides more detailed parameters on the fulfilment of certification requirements regarding the customary and legal rights of indigenous people. Several specific aspects of the PEFC scheme can be summarized as follows: (1) the strengthening of the credibility of conflict resolution within the framework of forest management, which is closely related to the customary and legal rights of the indigenous people/community, through a participatory and equitable agreement and institutionalized mechanism; (2) the ambitious obligation to carry out a social impact assessment of forest management activities regarding indigenous people and/or local communities, prior to their implementation; and (3) the obligation for the holder of the forest concession to identify the forest resources that have important value for recreation purposes and to protect them from the negative impacts of recreation activities. This parameter is thus strengthening governmental regulations, which were seen to have failed to enforce community development programmes as an obligation for forest concession holders (Ruslandi et al., 2014).Workers’ normative rights: Both the FSC and the PEFC set more or less comparable requirements regarding the obligation of the forest concession holders to fulfil all related normative rights of workers employed in these sectors in compliance with national regulations and international conventions, both in their operations and workplace infrastructure. However, compared to the FSC scheme, PEFC requirements seem to be slightly more imperative in this case in terms of the workers’ rights to collective bargaining with their company. In this regard, the PEFC clearly both complements and strengthens the governmental regulations.Yield sustainability and silviculture: PEFC requirements are very general, only requiring that silviculture techniques be included in the management plan, and that the harvest rate of forest products not exceed the rate of sustainable production. FSC, in turn, requires regular monitoring of harvest rates and logging cycles as well as their revision if the rates are not appropriate.In general, PEFC requirements in Indonesia are not as detailed as those of FSC. For example, the FSC document exemplifies significant activities that have to be included in the EIA that a company has to undertake. Meanwhile, PEFC details only the list of prohibited ingredients for pesticides. Another notable difference is that PEFC mentions several times that it requires concessions to be in compliance with national legislation including SVLK. This means that PEFC does not want to be contradictory to government regulations, and perhaps wants to gain the government’s endorsement. This also indicates that PEFC does not substitute government regulations.Having analysed the FSC and PEFC columns in the table above, it seems that PEFC does not add important requirements for SFM. Both FSC and PEFC show many similarities for each forest management component. Therefore, even though FSC and PEFC may not complement each other, both of them complement government regulations.4 Discussion4.1 PEFC AcceptabilityThis section makes an attempt to predict whether PEFC will be widely acceptable in the forest industry in Indonesia. The acceptability depends on PEFC’s current status in the country, the nature of its criteria, its differences compared to the existing scheme, i.e. FSC, and the socio-political conditions in the country.To begin with, it is worth noting that both FSC and PEFC are similar certification systems which focus on source-oriented standards in an effort to achieve SFM and sustainably produced wood. They have the same primary goal, which is to maintain and sustain the ecosystem integrity and its social functions (Van Bueren, 2010) (Table 3). Their mission is, quite simply, sustainable tropical forest management. Therefore, as forest policy analysts say, their proposed solution is developing a set of global sustainable forestry principles and criteria, engaging national and sub-national multi-stakeholder committees to develop regionally appropriate standards, inviting third parties to audit forestry operations for compliance, and finally, certifying those who pass the test (Cashore, Gale, Errol, & Newsom, 2006). However, they are in fact competing agents, and even prominent competitors of one another (Bernstein & Cashore, 2003; Cashore, Gale, Errol, & Newsom, 2006). The FSC, in its operations worldwide, still has to find some accommodation with its competitors (Bernstein & Cashore, 2003).Table 3Certification systems relevant to forest managementSource-oriented standardsGoalSFM/sustainably produced woodFSCMaintain and sustain the ecosystem integrity and its social functionsPEFC international and national systems endorsed by PEFCISO environment management systemRIL standard, Tropical Forest Foundation (USA)Source Van Bueren (2010)Normatively, the standards of the PEFC system are adaptable to the national characteristics, involving multiple stakeholders for consensus-based certifications. This system is also developed in a framework of cooperative action and without any negative campaign against any forest management unit. In this regard, the market sees it as a system which is easily accessible. The government itself sees that both the voluntary and mandatory certification systems have different histories, mechanisms and goals, but these schemes continue to have similar frameworks for developing criteria and indicators aimed to infuse sustainability principles into forest production and management. Thus, their development and implementation are likely to be mutually reinforcing and synergetic (MOEF, s.a.).As a market-driven certification scheme, the PEFC system has received relatively positive responses from concession holders. Forest coverage by this certification system has now grown to 304 million hectares worldwide (PEFC, 2017). Meanwhile, the FSC scheme, which was introduced much earlier in 1994, covers only 199 million hectares (FSC, 2018) (Table 4). This suggests that the certification system developed by the PEFC may have wider market acceptability.Table 4Comparing voluntary certification schemes and their operationsDimensionPEFCFSCYear of launching19991994Year of introduction in Indonesia20142000Area coverage worldwide304 million hectares199 million hectaresArea coverage in Indonesia3.8 million hectares3.1 million hectaresNumber of certificates6039PerceptionForest production industryEnvironmental activistsCriteriaCountries create their own standards based on seven meta-standardsTen rigid principles and criteria, to be applied universallySources Buckingham and Jepson (2013); Authors’ respondent; FSC (2018); PEFC (2017); IFCC (2018)In Indonesia, the PEFC certification system was introduced by the Indonesian Forestry Certification Cooperation (IFCC) as its National Governing Body at the end of 2014. Although it is still new and in the development phase, the PEFC scheme has had relatively high acceptability in Indonesia too. Within less than a year following its introduction, for instance, more than 600,000 ha (PEFC, 2015) of the industrial forest plantation (HTI—Hutan Tanaman Industri) were certified, a number that reached 3.7 million hectares in early 2018 (IFCC, 2018). At the same point in time, the FSC scheme, which had been introduced in 2000 already, covered Indonesian forest area of 3.1 million hectares (FSC, 2018) (Table 4). This assessment confirms earlier studies suggesting that the attraction to FSC certification remains comparatively weak in developing countries (Bernstein & Cashore, 2003; Cashore, Gale, Errol, & Newsom, 2006). Current data shows that only 23% of FSC-certified forest area is located in developing countries. Under the PEFC scheme, in fact, the share of developing countries in global certified area is even less—at around 9%. Nonetheless, the significance of these numbers should not be exaggerated. Principles introduced within the FSC scheme are universally applied to all countries, while principles under the PEFC scheme are prepared by the respective country and then agreed upon. In this regard, both schemes are rolled out according to their respective characteristics. The FSC scheme is perceived to be designed by environmentalists, whereas the PEFC is seen to be closer to the interests of forest production industries by analysts such as Buckingham and Jepson (2013). We can easily understand why some studies conclude that getting FSC certification will be time consuming and costly (Bartley 2010; Ruslandi et al., 2014). Requirements and standards imposed by the PEFC are not as tight as those imposed by the FSC. For instance, FSC certification cannot be granted to HTI which was converted from natural forest after November 1994, whereas PEFC certification only \excludes plantation forest which was converted from natural forest after 2010. It is, therefore, the big groups of forest concession holders in Indonesia like the Asia Pulp and Paper (APP) and Asia Pacific Resources International Limited (APRIL Group) that have obtained PEFC certification.Since the PEFC scheme seems relatively acceptable to the market in terms of its principles and standards, which are nationally adaptable and involve multiple stakeholders, more HTI areas may become PEFC-certified in future. An Indonesian forest business association, for instance, argued that the PEFC system, which is voluntary and market-driven, can be an important instrument to realize SFM as the system is also primarily targeted to achieve economic, social and ecological sustainability. The importance of this ISO-based scheme can also be seen as having strategic value for the market survival of forest concession holders. Indeed, rising concerns of forest companies to join PEFC may hint to its positive economic impact. The voluntary scheme can also strengthen the SFM processes which are normatively imposed by the state institution in charge, namely the MOEF in the context of enforcing the regulation, facilitation and oversight of forest companies’ compliance to SFM principles (interview with a business association).However, forest concession holders in Indonesia continue to face constraints in getting voluntary forest certification—not only because of their different financial capacities to bear the certification costs but also because of different preparation levels (Brockhaus, Obidzinski, Dermawan, Laumonier, & Luttrell, 2012). Companies who got certified have usually applied SFM practices right from the beginning so that they do not have to bear huge certification costs (interview with a forestry researcher).4.2 The PEFC Scheme’s Implications for SFM in IndonesiaAs indicated above, PEFC may strengthen the SFM policies that Indonesia has so far undertaken for social and environmental protection including the reduction of carbon emissions from the forest sector. Even though it is comparatively well-accepted by the private sector, this does not mean that PEFC will automatically become the main source of certification. As mentioned before, the government itself has developed and imposed a mandatory certification scheme, PHPL, for forest concession holders. This programme was actually an improved version of a set of voluntary government programmes commissioned by LEI. It resulted from the concerns of environmental activists as well as USA and European tropical timber consumers demanding a certification programme (as a market instrument) for forest products to reduce the pace of tropical forest degradation in the world (MOEF, 2015). However, the programme does not address the technical problem of trade of forest timber and is not targeted to fulfil market demands in the same way as the voluntary certification programmes.In addition, the Indonesian forest business association has planned to develop a so-called SelfDeclare certification programme. This programme is mandatory for all association members with the purpose of measuring their actual performance in achieving sustainable production forest management. It aims to promote its members’ readiness to fulfil the governmental mandatory certification programme and the voluntary market-driven programmes. Since the certification programme is mainly about facilitation, the criteria and indicators used as a basis for evaluation focus on input and processes rather than on output.Despite the existence of other initiatives, there are prospects for continued and growing acceptance of the PEFC certification scheme in Indonesia. Since the PHPL programme does not necessarily suit market demands, the PEFC scheme, based on nationally adapted principles and standards, may become a viable voluntary alternative.Indeed, PHPL faces a number of constraints relating to implementing agencies’ capacities and poor performance of forestry governance and certain law enforcement activities. The introduction of the FSC and PEFC certification programmes was in part driven by a lack of “market trust”. This lack of trust, which had also resulted in the imposition of a due diligence policy for Indonesian forest products earlier on, relates to high corruption levels in Indonesia as well as poor forest management indices (interview with a certification body), amongst other issues. PHPL’s performance also depends on the degree to which government-to-government (G-to-G) SFM cooperation mechanisms between Indonesia and the countries of timber product consumers are strengthened. If this is not the case, the credibility of the PHPL scheme as an instrument to achieve SFM may suffer. There is also a growing concern amongst producers that consumers from other major markets outside the USA and Europe are likely to demand tighter certification of forest products as well. In this regard, forest producers have begun to realize that a market-driven voluntary certification scheme such as PEFC is a choice they have to make (interview with a business association).Overall, the future application and success of the PEFC scheme in Indonesia will be dependent on two significant aspects. First, a high level of support from the main stakeholders, namely civil society, industry and, most importantly, the government, will be required. As in the regional context, voluntary certification programmes in Indonesia have in fact not been getting full support from these main stakeholders. Data shows that the Indonesian government was not supportive enough of some voluntary forest certification schemes, in this case the FSC, while voluntary standards developed by LEI were seen as an important way to preserve national autonomy and sovereignty as well as compatibility with domestic circumstances. In the context of Indonesian industry, the development of LEI standards was at least in part supported by the industry associations. With regard to civil society support, the Rainforest Alliance has played an active role, with its SmartWood programme certifying the first-ever developing country forest operation, Perum Perhutani, in Indonesia in 1990. But, there are also NGOs that have not been supportive of voluntary certification. The World Rainforest Movement, allied with local forestry NGOs such as the Indonesian Forum for the Environment (WALHI—Wahana Lingkungan Hidup Indonesia), for instance, called for a moratorium on FSC and LEI certification. This socio-economic and political constellation underlines a viable argument that the Asia-Pacific region basically lacks the general structural conditions for effective forest certification (Cashore, Gale, Errol, & Newsom, 2006).Second, the legitimacy of PEFC will flow from both domestic and global actors. The importance of the legitimacy issue here can be seen in the context of PEFC’s status as a non-state (governance) scheme, which means that it lacks the traditional enforcement capacities associated with the sovereign state in the realm of global governance (Howlett & Ramesh, 1995; Bernstein & Cashore, 2003). Even though voluntary forest certification plays an important role in the absence of binding international law on tropical forest use, its global legitimacy is still contested and this has local repercussions. In terms of domestic legitimacy, stakeholders’ hesitant acceptance of FSC is an experience that PEFC should keep in mind. The degree to which the scheme becomes an effective anchor for national SFM in Indonesia and also for the governance of global emissions from the forestry sector remains to be seen.5 ConclusionThis study investigated whether PEFC as a relatively new forest certification system in Indonesia substitutes or complements the existing forest certification systems, which mainly are FSC and government regulations. In addition, this study also aimed to predict whether concession holders are likely to be further attracted to obtain PEFC certification. In other words, the study sought to understand the role PEFC is likely to play for the purpose of SFM in Indonesia.This study found that PEFC seems to substitute FSC as both schemes are very similar but FSC requirements are more detailed and stricter than PEFC’s and thus attract fewer concession holders. Both PEFC and FSC complement government regulations as both voluntary schemes require higher standards than the government regulations. This indicates that voluntary forest certification schemes can play a role to fill the global forest governance gap in the absence of a binding hard law.However, to measure PEFC acceptability in Indonesia, two aspects still play an importance role—the degree to which domestic stakeholder support is given, and PEFC’s global legitimacy as a non-state scheme. Some of the domestic stakeholders including the government and parts of civil society do not show sufficient support. Thus, its potential contribution to national SFM in Indonesia and, eventually, to the governance of global emissions from the forestry sector remains to be seen.Future research could delve into the technical requirements of each certification scheme and its applicability in the Indonesian forestry sector. Analysing perceptions of a broad range of stakeholders regarding each scheme is also important in order to determine best practices for forest management.ReferencesBartley, T. (2010).

A.C. antes Pronatura Chiapas A.C. es una asociación civil sin fines de lucro fundada en 1989 y con personalidad jurídica desde 1993. Nuestra organización mantiene una estrecha colaboración con las organizaciones de Pronatura en México, con las que se comparten acciones coordinadas, y programas nacionales. Pronatura Sur A.C. cuenta con un Consejo Directivo propio y sistemas de gestión institucional independientes. Objetivos estratÃ©gicos Catalizar estrategias y experiencias de apropiación en torno al manejo sostenible y conservación de los ecosistemas, promoviendo su funcionalidad  y resiliencia para la mitigación y adaptación al cambio climático, asegurando la participación activa de los actores locales. Incidir en las políticas públicas para mejorar su pertinencia y la coordinación intersectorial ; en particular en aquellas que impactan al manejo del territorio, la biodiversidad y el desarrollo social. Fortalecer de manera estratégica a organizaciones de base, redes  e instituciones locales para mejorar sus capacidades técnicas, de gobernanza y organizativas encaminadas a la incidencia en la conservación y la sustentabilidad Promover una cultura de participación social incluyente orientada a la toma de decisiones en torno al desarrollo sustentable y la conservación tomando como base la experiencia y conocimiento previos. Generar alternativas de desarrollo rural de baja emisiones, basadas en la integralidad del manejo del territorio y en la promoción de buenas prácticas, así como de mercados diversificados y alternativos. Principios de acciÃ³n Estamos orientados a que nuestro trabajo beneficie a las comunidades y grupos sociales que directamente dependen de los recursos naturales y biodiversidad, consideramos que la conservación de la naturaleza sólo se logrará con cambios profundos en los valores de nuestras sociedades y mayor justicia y equidad. Trabajamos buscando estrategias, modelos y alternativas que hagan posible conservar la biodiversidad a la vez que se mejora la calidad de vida. Nos enfrentamos al reto de conciliar la gran riqueza natural del Sur de México con la pobreza y marginación de su población. Consideramos que la pobreza se puede resolver con mayores beneficios del uso y manejo sostenible de los recursos naturales, y con relaciones más justas de consumo y producción. La organización social, la participación y el desarrollo de capacidades son detonadores de los cambios sociales. Trabajamos en áreas prioritarias por su biodiversidad y por su grado de vulnerabilidad, de esta manera buscamos contribuir a mantener la riqueza natural de México y de los servicios ambientales, en particular el agua, los suelos y el clima. Nos orientamos a tener resultados concretos y tangibles en los sitios donde trabajamos. Trabajamos en alianzas, colaboraciones y redes pues creemos que ninguna organización por si misma puede enfrentar la gran problemática del desarrollo sustentable. Tendemos puentes con diversos sectores y promovemos que los actores locales, así como instituciones nacionales e internacionales colaboren de manera conjunta. Sabemos que muchas soluciones se encuentran en una mejor gestión de las instituciones públicas, por lo que nuestras experiencias buscan además incidir en los programas y políticas gubernamentales, así como del sector privado y de las organizaciones campesinas. Consideramos que las mujeres y los jóvenes tienen derecho de participar en las decisiones sobre el desarrollo a nivel local, comunitario, y a todos los niveles. Generamos acciones para mejorar la posición y condición de jóvenes y mujeres en la participación de las iniciativas. Identidad Colectiva Fotos de los proyectos que toman l@s compañer@s pronaturianos.

ProVeg International works in four continents with eight offices. The organisation operates in Germany (ProVeg Deutschland, founded as Vegetarierbund Deutschland in 1892), the Netherlands (ProVeg Nederland, founded as Viva Las Vega's in 2011), the United Kingdom, Poland, Spain, China, South Africa and the United States. ProVeg's stated mission is to reduce the consumption of animal products by 50% by the year 2040.[2] Contents 1 History 2 Activities 2.1 Conferences 2.2 Food industry development 2.3 Publications 2.4 School programmes 2.5 European Union campaigns 2.5.1 EU 'veggie burger ban' 2.5.2 EU animal products advertisements 3 Recognition 4 External links 5 References History[edit] ProVeg International was founded in 2017. It has the following country branches. Germany (ProVeg Deutschland, dating back to the 1867 foundation of the Verein für natürliche Lebensweise[3]),  Poland, and  United Kingdom[4] were the founding branches in April 2017. ProVeg subsequently expanded to the following countries. Spain, where a branch started in October 2017[1],  Netherlands, the former organisation Viva Las Vega's, founded in 2011 and incorporated in November 2017 as ProVeg Nederland.[5] China, launched in 2018[6] and  South Africa, taken over in August 2018, founded in 2011 as Vegalicious.[7] United States, operating since 2019.[8] Czechia since August 2021, after the incorporation of the Czech Vegan Society[9], founded in 2014.[10] Activities[edit] Conferences[edit] New Food Conference: the New Food Conference organised by ProVeg is an international event focusing on plant-based and cultured products developments. The first edition took place in Berlin in March 2019.[11][12][13][14] Vegan Summerfest: In cooperation with Berlin Vegan and the Albert Schweitzer Foundation, ProVeg is the main host and co-organiser of the annual Vegan Summerfest (German: Veganes Sommerfest), a three-day vegan food festival that takes place on the Alexanderplatz in Berlin. The 2019 edition featured around 100 information and selling stands.[15] VegMed: ProVeg hosts VegMed, an annual international medical congress on plant-based diet. It is aimed at physicians, medical students, healthcare professionals, as well as scientists and related disciplines. In 2019, the sixth edition was held in London, the first VegMed outside Germany.[16] Food industry development[edit] Smart Protein: In October 2019, ProVeg International was awarded funds to carry out Smart Protein, an EU-funded project including over 30 partners to develop commercially viable plant-based products from underutilised raw materials. From 2020 to 2024, ProVeg assesses markets for the Smart Protein targeted-proteins ingredients and food products by investigating consumer acceptance and trust towards innovative and new plant-based products.[17][18] V-label: In Germany, ProVeg International is responsible for licensing the V-label, an international label that certifies vegetarian and vegan products.[19] ProVeg Incubator: the business incubator arm of ProVeg, created to support vegan startups, as well as startups using cellular agriculture techniques.[20] It was established in October 2018,[21] and according to Forbes, it was the first business incubator of its kind.[22] The incubator has an international outlook, engaging in its activities within several countries.[21] It counts Mark Post and Ryan Bethencourt among the members of its mentoring programme.[21] By May 2020, the Incubator has supported over 30 startups from 15 different countries.[23] By 2021, the Incubator has supported 50 startups.[24] Publications[edit] European Consumer Survey: ProVeg International launched a European Consumer Survey on Plant-Based Foods, which surveyed over 6,000 consumers across nine European countries to identify priorities for products improvement and development. 76% of participants identified as plant-based eaters, while the other 24% called themselves reducers. The survey's first report, published in June 2020, among other things found that participants were primarily interested in increasing the availability of plant-based cheese in supermarkets; additionally, reducers wanted to see more plant-based ready meals and meat replacements, while plant-based eaters were more interested in plant-based baked goods and chocolates.[25][26] Pandemic report: In July 2020, ProVeg published the Food & Pandemics Report, stating that intensive animal farming is the most dangerous man-made cause of pandemics and epidemics such as COVID-19, Ebola, SARS and MERS, all of which are zoonotic. As slaughterhouses are particularly vulnerable to infection and forced shutdowns, this also disrupts the food supply chain that humans rely on for survival. The report, citing various scientific experts and organisations, concluded that fundamental changes in the current global food system would be necessary to prevent future pandemics. The report received support from the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), with Musonda Mumba saying increased interactions between humans, wild animals and farmed animals have created unprecedented opportunities for pathogens to spread. European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) chief Tamas Bakonyi nuanced some of the report's findings, adding that intense human global travelling (especially in groups), human overpopulation, deforestation, land use, the transportation of goods and other factors played key roles in causing pandemics as well.[27][28][29] School programmes[edit] Plant Powered Pupils: ProVeg launched its Plant Powered Pupils programme in 2016, supported by the German health insurance company BKK ProVita.[30] The programme aims to empower children and adolescents by educating them about the impact of their food choices through interactive cooking workshops.[31] Climate-Efficient School Kitchens: Climate-Efficient School Kitchens is a joint project between ProVeg and the Institute for Future Studies and Technology Assessment (Institut für Zukunftsstudien und Technologiebewertung, IZT), which provides free training for kitchen staff, trainee chefs, and caterers in ways to prepare sustainable, low-cost, healthy meals in public schools. This features ingredients such as plant-based, low-carbon-footprint alternatives to meat, as well as energy-saving kitchen appliances.[32] School Plates: ProVeg launched the School Plates programme in the UK in June 2018 with the goal of making primary school menus healthier.[33] European Union campaigns[edit] EU 'veggie burger ban'[edit] The European Parliament Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development proposed prohibiting meat and dairy names for plant-based alternatives (such as 'vegetarian sausage' and 'soy schnitzel'), as these were allegedly 'confusing'[34] in May 2019. ProVeg International fought this proposal. On 8 October 2020, it co-signed a letter to Members of the European Parliament asking to vote down the proposal, alongside IKEA and Compassion in World Farming.[35] ProVeg also ran a petition to prevent this intended 'veggie burger ban'. Within three days, the petition received over 16,000 signatures.[36][37], and over 150,000 signatures by 15 October 2020.[38] ProVeg vice-chair Jasmijn de Boo told The Guardian: '[the ban] is clearly nonsense. Just as we all know there is no butter in peanut butter, consumers [buying veggie burgers] know exactly what they're getting. These proposals are in direct contradiction of the EU's stated objectives in the European Green Deal and Farm to Fork strategy to create healthier and more sustainable food systems.'[39] On 23 October 2020, the European Parliament voted against the 'veggie burger ban' for meat replacement names, but did pass a restriction on plant-based dairy alternative names, so that 'yogurt-style' or 'cheese-alternative' could be prohibited in the future, in addition to the already-banned names including 'almond milk' and 'vegan cheese'. De Boo welcomed the rejection of the veggie burger ban, but 'deeply regretted' the dairy ban, stating: 'It is inconceivable to us just how the European Parliament could take such different positions on such similar proposals.'[40] EU animal products advertisements[edit] In 2020 and 2021, ProVeg criticised the EU's advertisement campaigns for animal products.[41][42] Recognition[edit] ProVeg has permanent-observer status with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC),[43] is a member of the UNFCCC Climate Technology Centre and Network (CTCN),[44] and is accredited for UN Environment Programme (UNEP) Assembly.[45] ProVeg has received the United Nations’ Momentum for Change Award in 2018[46] for two of its programmes: Climate-Efficient School Kitchens and Plant-Powered Pupils.[47] External links[edit] Official website 2018 ProVeg review by Animal Charity Evaluators References[edit] ^ a b ""Conoce ProVeg, 100% Veggie, Ética y Saludable"".

(previously Vegetarierbund Deutschland e. V. (VEBU), in English translated as German Vegetarian Association[3]) is a German non-profit organisation whose goal is to reduce the consumption of animal products.[4] ProVeg Deutschland is part of ProVeg International, which serves as an international umbrella for a group of nationally operating organisations. The eingetragener Verein's assembly seat and organisational headquarters is located in Berlin.[5] As of 2015, ProVeg Deutschland had 14,000 members,[2] which made it the largest organisation of meatfree living people in the German-speaking world.[6] The association is a member of the European Vegetarian Union (EVU) and the International Vegetarian Union (IVU). Since 1996, Thomas Schönberger has served as its president. He publishes the member magazine ProVeg Magazin. Contents 1 Goals 2 History 3 Membership evolution 4 Finances 5 Activities 6 References 7 External links Goals[edit] According to its own stated objectives, the association strives to ""establish in our society a nutritional style and agricultural attitude which are apt for the future, and are vegetarian or vegan, ecologically, ethically and socially responsible and economically viable.""[7] Furthermore, its stated goal is to reduce the average per capita meat consumption, to increase knowledge and awareness about the needs and interests of animals and to enshrine animal rights in the domain of nutrition, consumption and legislation. Scientific insights into the positive effects of a vegetarian or vegan lifestyle on the environment, in particular on the global climate and world hunger problematics, should be disseminated and an ecologically and economically sustainable diet should be promoted worldwide.[8] History[edit] Title page of Vegetarische Warte, the first member magazine of the later VEBU The beginning of the vegetarian movement in Germany lies in the 19th century. In 1867 in Nordhausen, Eduard Baltzer founded the Deutsche Verein für natürliche Lebensweise (""German Association for Natural Lifestyle""), which was followed by a series of other vegetarian associations. This association merged on 7 June 1892 with the Hamburger Vegetarierverein (""Hamburg Vegetarian Association"") to the Deutschen Vegetarierbund (""German Vegetarian League""). This association was founded in Leipzig with the goal of significantly reducing meat consumption in Germany, in order to contribute to a global improvement to ecological and health-related problems. At the time, the association's magazine was called Vegetarische Rundschau (""Vegetarian Review""), later Vegetarische Warte (""Vegetarian Lookout"").[9] In 1932, vegetarians from across the world attended a conference in Oranienburg.[citation needed] However, the member magazine could no longer appear since 1933. Under pressure from the Nazis, who accused vegetarian organisations of ""promoting pacifism"", the association had to dissolve itself on 18 February 1935.[9] After the Second World War, a re-establishment took place in 1946, although it was hindered by the separation of the Allied occupation zones of Germany. Therefore, at the instigation of Adolf Briest,[citation needed] initially two clubs emerged, the Vegetarier-Union Deutschlands (""Vegetarian Union of Germany""; VUD) on 29 May 1946 in Sontra near Kassel (American occupation zone) and the Deutsche Vegetarier-Union (""German Vegetarian Union""; DVU) in the French occupation zone, which lasted until the 1970s. The new magazine Der Vegetarier (""The Vegetarian"") was founded in 1956, and the same year the Deutscher-Vegetarier-Rat (""German Vegetarian Council"") was established. From there, many local branches were formed in West Germany.[9] In 1973, the VUD merged with the Freundeskreis der deutschen Reformjugend to the Bund für Lebenserneuerung. Vereinigung für ethische Lebensgestaltung, Vegetarismus und Lebensreform (""League for Life Renewal. Association for Ethical Life Design, Vegetarianism and Life Reform""). This complex name was given the simple predicate Vegetarierbund Deutschland (""Vegetarian League Germany"", VEBU), which became its sole name from 2008 onwards.[9] At an extraordinary member assembly on 22 April 2017 in Berlin, a name change from VEBU to ProVeg Deutschland was agreed upon, and the association became part of the umbrella ProVeg International.[10] Membership evolution[edit] Before the year 2008, the membership had stagnated.[11] Since then, however, a strong membership growth has occurred. This was due to new memberships, but also because of the absorption of the Vegetarischen Gesellschaft Stuttgart (""Stuttgart Vegetarian Society"", co-founded Gustav Struve in 1868) into the VEBU in 2012. Year Membership 2008 2,500[12] 2009 2,800 2010 3,400[13] 2011 4,800[14] 2012 7,000[15] 2013 10,000[16] 2014 12,000[17] 2015 14,000[18] 2017 14,000[9] Finances[edit] ProVeg Deutschland primarily finances itself by membership contributions, donations, and income generated from licensing the European Vegetarian Union's V-Label.[19] Furthermore, there is an Active Fund to support public relations.[20] Since May 2014, VEBU/ProVeg Deutschland has carried the seal of the Initiative Transparente Zivilgesellschaft, which requires transparency about, for example, staff structure and expenses.[21] Activities[edit] Former logo In Germany, the association has the authority to award the V-Label, which is a seal of approval for vegetarian and vegan products. Amongst others, Aldi-Süd has been labeling some products with the V label since 2014.[22] In order to create a sustainable nutritional situation, it has initiated a series of campaigns. The Thursday is Veggieday campaign aims to promote vegetarian and vegan food in restaurants and in canteen catering.[23] ProVeg also calls on active and interested parties every year to participate in the Worldwide Vegan Bake Sale, the annual vegan cake campaign days and to participate in the meatout campaign days.[24][25] Since 1999, the member magazine has been quarterly published under the title Vebu magazin, later renamed ProVeg Magazin, with about 16,000 copies and a size of 48 pages.[26][27] Furthermore, ProVeg and the Veggie Times produce and distribute a newspaper that should give interested people and beginners an overview and tips about a plant-based lifestyle.[28] In addition, various information media are used to reach members and interested parties. There is also a veggie app for smartphones that can be used to find out about veggie-friendly restaurants on the go.[29][30] In addition to general public relations work and services for members and interested parties, ProVeg also has a press office that represents ProVeg in the media.[31] As a local contact point for vegetarians and vegans, the concept of regional groups or regional contacts was created, which as of 2014 consists of over 200 regional contacts and groups.[32] The VEBU was the organiser of the 38th World Vegetarian Congress 2008 in Dresden. The first VeggieWorld (promoted as 'Europe's largest fair for the vegan lifestyle') took place in February 2011'. This fair around the meat-free lifestyle with around 40 exhibitors, under the sponsorship of the VEBU in Wiesbaden with more than 20,000 visitors. The fair has also been held in Düsseldorf since 2011. At the same time, visitors to the supporting programme can find out about a sustainable lifestyle and plant-based nutrition. Celebrities have been guests, among others Attila Hildmann, Barbara Rütting, Marion Kracht, Ariane Sommer and Anne Menden.[33] ProVeg has been running its Karnismus erkennen (Recognising Carnism) project since autumn 2014[34] in cooperation with social psychologist Melanie Joy for public education around the theme of carnism.[35] At the beginning of February 2016, a staging as part of a campaign caused a stir in the media: in the fictional Swiss restaurant La Table Suisse, pets like cats and dogs were offered for consumption. After media coverage in over 25 countries reported it and a shitstorm emerged on social media channels, the action was exposed in mid-February 2016 as a setup. ProVeg, the Swiss Association for Vegetarianism Swissveg and the Beyond Carnism association released a joint press statement.[36] References[edit] ^ Vegetarierbund Deutschland: Satzung. § 2.

(previously Vegetarierbund Deutschland e. V. (VEBU), in English translated as German Vegetarian Association[3]) is a German non-profit organisation whose goal is to reduce the consumption of animal products.[4] ProVeg Deutschland is part of ProVeg International, which serves as an international umbrella for a group of nationally operating organisations. The eingetragener Verein's assembly seat and organisational headquarters is located in Berlin.[5] As of 2015, ProVeg Deutschland had 14,000 members,[2] which made it the largest organisation of meatfree living people in the German-speaking world.[6] The association is a member of the European Vegetarian Union (EVU) and the International Vegetarian Union (IVU). Since 1996, Thomas Schönberger has served as its president. He publishes the member magazine ProVeg Magazin. Contents 1 Goals 2 History 3 Membership evolution 4 Finances 5 Activities 6 References 7 External links Goals[edit] According to its own stated objectives, the association strives to ""establish in our society a nutritional style and agricultural attitude which are apt for the future, and are vegetarian or vegan, ecologically, ethically and socially responsible and economically viable.""[7] Furthermore, its stated goal is to reduce the average per capita meat consumption, to increase knowledge and awareness about the needs and interests of animals and to enshrine animal rights in the domain of nutrition, consumption and legislation. Scientific insights into the positive effects of a vegetarian or vegan lifestyle on the environment, in particular on the global climate and world hunger problematics, should be disseminated and an ecologically and economically sustainable diet should be promoted worldwide.[8] History[edit] Title page of Vegetarische Warte, the first member magazine of the later VEBU The beginning of the vegetarian movement in Germany lies in the 19th century. In 1867 in Nordhausen, Eduard Baltzer founded the Deutsche Verein für natürliche Lebensweise (""German Association for Natural Lifestyle""), which was followed by a series of other vegetarian associations. This association merged on 7 June 1892 with the Hamburger Vegetarierverein (""Hamburg Vegetarian Association"") to the Deutschen Vegetarierbund (""German Vegetarian League""). This association was founded in Leipzig with the goal of significantly reducing meat consumption in Germany, in order to contribute to a global improvement to ecological and health-related problems. At the time, the association's magazine was called Vegetarische Rundschau (""Vegetarian Review""), later Vegetarische Warte (""Vegetarian Lookout"").[9] In 1932, vegetarians from across the world attended a conference in Oranienburg.[citation needed] However, the member magazine could no longer appear since 1933. Under pressure from the Nazis, who accused vegetarian organisations of ""promoting pacifism"", the association had to dissolve itself on 18 February 1935.[9] After the Second World War, a re-establishment took place in 1946, although it was hindered by the separation of the Allied occupation zones of Germany. Therefore, at the instigation of Adolf Briest,[citation needed] initially two clubs emerged, the Vegetarier-Union Deutschlands (""Vegetarian Union of Germany""; VUD) on 29 May 1946 in Sontra near Kassel (American occupation zone) and the Deutsche Vegetarier-Union (""German Vegetarian Union""; DVU) in the French occupation zone, which lasted until the 1970s. The new magazine Der Vegetarier (""The Vegetarian"") was founded in 1956, and the same year the Deutscher-Vegetarier-Rat (""German Vegetarian Council"") was established. From there, many local branches were formed in West Germany.[9] In 1973, the VUD merged with the Freundeskreis der deutschen Reformjugend to the Bund für Lebenserneuerung. Vereinigung für ethische Lebensgestaltung, Vegetarismus und Lebensreform (""League for Life Renewal. Association for Ethical Life Design, Vegetarianism and Life Reform""). This complex name was given the simple predicate Vegetarierbund Deutschland (""Vegetarian League Germany"", VEBU), which became its sole name from 2008 onwards.[9] At an extraordinary member assembly on 22 April 2017 in Berlin, a name change from VEBU to ProVeg Deutschland was agreed upon, and the association became part of the umbrella ProVeg International.[10] Membership evolution[edit] Before the year 2008, the membership had stagnated.[11] Since then, however, a strong membership growth has occurred. This was due to new memberships, but also because of the absorption of the Vegetarischen Gesellschaft Stuttgart (""Stuttgart Vegetarian Society"", co-founded Gustav Struve in 1868) into the VEBU in 2012. Year Membership 2008 2,500[12] 2009 2,800 2010 3,400[13] 2011 4,800[14] 2012 7,000[15] 2013 10,000[16] 2014 12,000[17] 2015 14,000[18] 2017 14,000[9] Finances[edit] ProVeg Deutschland primarily finances itself by membership contributions, donations, and income generated from licensing the European Vegetarian Union's V-Label.[19] Furthermore, there is an Active Fund to support public relations.[20] Since May 2014, VEBU/ProVeg Deutschland has carried the seal of the Initiative Transparente Zivilgesellschaft, which requires transparency about, for example, staff structure and expenses.[21] Activities[edit] Former logo In Germany, the association has the authority to award the V-Label, which is a seal of approval for vegetarian and vegan products. Amongst others, Aldi-Süd has been labeling some products with the V label since 2014.[22] In order to create a sustainable nutritional situation, it has initiated a series of campaigns. The Thursday is Veggieday campaign aims to promote vegetarian and vegan food in restaurants and in canteen catering.[23] ProVeg also calls on active and interested parties every year to participate in the Worldwide Vegan Bake Sale, the annual vegan cake campaign days and to participate in the meatout campaign days.[24][25] Since 1999, the member magazine has been quarterly published under the title Vebu magazin, later renamed ProVeg Magazin, with about 16,000 copies and a size of 48 pages.[26][27] Furthermore, ProVeg and the Veggie Times produce and distribute a newspaper that should give interested people and beginners an overview and tips about a plant-based lifestyle.[28] In addition, various information media are used to reach members and interested parties. There is also a veggie app for smartphones that can be used to find out about veggie-friendly restaurants on the go.[29][30] In addition to general public relations work and services for members and interested parties, ProVeg also has a press office that represents ProVeg in the media.[31] As a local contact point for vegetarians and vegans, the concept of regional groups or regional contacts was created, which as of 2014 consists of over 200 regional contacts and groups.[32] The VEBU was the organiser of the 38th World Vegetarian Congress 2008 in Dresden. The first VeggieWorld (promoted as 'Europe's largest fair for the vegan lifestyle') took place in February 2011'. This fair around the meat-free lifestyle with around 40 exhibitors, under the sponsorship of the VEBU in Wiesbaden with more than 20,000 visitors. The fair has also been held in Düsseldorf since 2011. At the same time, visitors to the supporting programme can find out about a sustainable lifestyle and plant-based nutrition. Celebrities have been guests, among others Attila Hildmann, Barbara Rütting, Marion Kracht, Ariane Sommer and Anne Menden.[33] ProVeg has been running its Karnismus erkennen (Recognising Carnism) project since autumn 2014[34] in cooperation with social psychologist Melanie Joy for public education around the theme of carnism.[35] At the beginning of February 2016, a staging as part of a campaign caused a stir in the media: in the fictional Swiss restaurant La Table Suisse, pets like cats and dogs were offered for consumption. After media coverage in over 25 countries reported it and a shitstorm emerged on social media channels, the action was exposed in mid-February 2016 as a setup. ProVeg, the Swiss Association for Vegetarianism Swissveg and the Beyond Carnism association released a joint press statement.[36] References[edit] ^ Vegetarierbund Deutschland: Satzung. § 2.

With the Indiana Climate Change Impacts Assessment, we’re changing the conversation and helping Hoosiers understand the ways a shifting climate affects our day-to-day lives.” -- Melissa Widhalm, IN CCIA Coordinator Climate + Faith For Carla Kilgore, simple living is a tenet of her faith that directly translates into caring for our environment and neighbors. In her household, this means taking steps to reduce their own contributions to climate change. Watch the Video Is Indiana's Climate Changing? Over the last century, weather observations show that Indiana has become warmer and wetter. Indiana scientists have concluded these climate trends will continue and intensify, affecting the health and wellbeing of all Hoosiers.

The Purdue Climate Change Research Center (PCCRC) facilitates interdisciplinary climate change research, education, and engagement. From its inception in 2004, the PCCRC assembled a community of scholars who shared the perspective that human and natural systems should be studied as an integrated whole. Over 51 completed research projects Provided 97 student travel grants Hosted 68 campus workshops, conferences & lectures We bring together faculty, postdocs, students and professional staff from 27 departments across 8 of Purdue’s academic units to address the challenges and complexities of climate and related global change. Research teams are exploring the causes and impacts of climate change, improving predictive models to project future climate conditions, and pursuing novel ideas for mitigation and adaptation. The PCCRC supports the ambitious, innovative ideas of our researchers by breaking down disciplinary and administrative barriers to help ideas take shape.

196,"Team Canada, Sweden ask IOC to push back start time for women's soccer final | CTV News Home FOLLOW ON Advertisement SPORTS Team Canada, Sweden ask IOC to push back start time for women's soccer final Gregory Strong The Canadian Press Staff Contact Published Wednesday, August 4, 2021 3:56AM EDT Last Updated Wednesday, August 4, 2021 3:56AM EDT Share: Reddit Share Text: TOKYO -- Canadian and Swedish team officials have asked organizers to push back the scheduled late-morning kickoff time for the women's soccer final to avoid the searing heat expected Friday at Tokyo's Olympic Stadium. ""The COC supports Canada Soccer's request to change the time of the women's soccer final,"" Canadian Olympic Committee chief sport officer Eric Myles said Wednesday in a statement. ""It is in the best interest of the athletes."" The final is scheduled to begin at 11 a.m. local time Friday (10 p.m. eastern time on Thursday). The local forecast called for mostly sunny conditions and a high of 34 C, with the humidity expected to make it feel more like the low 40s. Complete coverage: Click for all the news from the Tokyo Olympics Moving the kickoff to the late afternoon would allow the athletes to play in the shade at the 68,000-seat outdoor stadium, since the sun sets in the early evening this time of year in Tokyo. The Olympic Stadium is also home to athletics competition, but the first track and field event at the venue on Friday isn't scheduled to begin until 8:25 p.m. A soccer game typically lasts about two hours, but extra time or a penalty shootout could extend play into a third hour. Fredrik Madestam, the media officer for the Swedish women's national team, said Wednesday that the federation's delegation head confirmed the Swedish national committee had put in a request with the IOC to delay the start. Marika Domanski Lyfors, the head of Sweden's women's team, said she had discussed the request with FIFA, the sport's governing body. ""It is primarily about the players' health we're thinking about and trying to change the time of the game,"" she told Swedish media late Tuesday. ""There's a pretty big difference between playing in the afternoon or evening, and we are very much exposed to the warmth and heat."" Messages left with IOC media relations staff were not immediately returned. Madestam, who said Lyfors spoke to reporters in Swedish, confirmed the translation. ""If we have to play at 11 o'clock in the morning, then we are prepared, but it would clearly be much better for the performance and the game to have the possibility to play it later,"" Lyfors said. ""Canada have exactly the same opinion."" Canada Soccer issued a brief statement Wednesday. ""Canada Soccer is also in support of changing the kickoff time of the gold medal match at the Tokyo 2020 women's Olympic football tournament to ensure the health and safety of our players,"" it said. Canada qualified for its first-ever appearance in the Olympic women's soccer final with a 1-0 victory over the United States on Monday at Ibaraki Kashima Stadium. That game kicked off at 5 p.m. local time. Sweden defeated Australia 1-0 in the other semi, in a game that kicked off at 8 p.m. Monday local time at International Stadium Yokohama. Sweden holds the No. 5 position in the latest FIFA rankings, three spots ahead of Canada. ""We definitely have some mixed results against Sweden,"" Canadian defender Kadeisha Buchanan said after her team's semifinal win. ""Sometimes we win, sometimes we don't get the result that we want. ""It'll be a good match, a good final."" The Canadian team was expected to train and hold a formal media availability on Thursday. Sweden won silver at the 2016 Games in Rio. Canada won bronze five years ago and also took third place at the 2012 London Games. The women's bronze-medal game between the U.S. and Australia was scheduled for a 5 p.m. start on Thursday at Kashima. Both men's medal games were scheduled to kick off at night. Mexico and Japan will meet for bronze Friday (8 p.m. local) at Saitama Stadium. The men's final between Brazil and Spain will be played Saturday (8:30 p.m. local) in Yokohama.

Vi skriver:""Sveaskog skriver att de ”vill bidra till att nå de svenska miljömålen, Parisavtalet liksom EU:s biodiversitetsmål.” Det är mål som borde sätta ramen för Sveaskog. Bolagets ”hållbarhetsinrikting” är dock så undermålig att den kommer hindra Sveriges chanser att nå just dessa miljö- och klimatmål.""Sveaskog har i sin artikel kommit med ett sexpunktsförslag, det tycker vi signalerar att de är bra på PR men har en ren ovilja att bedriva ett hållbart och klimaträttvist skogsbruk. Istället har vi ett förslag som är i linje med vad som krävs för att nå klimat- och miljömål:🔥 Vi uppmanar regering och riksdag att skydda alla statligt ägda skogar med höga naturvärden, samt de som kan utveckla naturvärden på lite sikt.🔥 Respektera samebyarnas tydliga och bestämda uppfattning om att kalhyggeskvoten inom renskötselområdet är nådd.Makthavare, nu är det upp till er, det är ert ansvar att de sista naturskogarna i Sverige nu skyddas, innan det är försent.

Att vi befinner oss i en klimatkris är inget nytt. Tre graders uppvärmning börjar snart bli en sanning om vi inte tillsammans agerar och visar att Sverige kan gå före och visa omvärlden att det går att göra mer. Barn och unga är oroliga för klimatet. Vi skriver: ""Framtiden är redan här. Barn och unga påverkas redan i dag både fysiskt och psykiskt av klimatkrisen. I Sverige är det främst ungas psykiska hälsa och framtidstro som påverkas. [...]Undersökningar visar att sex av tio unga känner oro för klimatförändringarna och framtiden – en del beskriver oron som panikartad och ständigt närvarande. [www.wwf.se/pressmeddelande/okad-oro-for-klimatet-och-naturen-under-pandemin-3920434/]Samtidigt finns ett starkt stöd för en klimatundervisning i framkant från unga.En nyligen publicerad Novusundersökning, beställd av Våra barns klimat, visar att drygt åtta av tio unga mellan 12 och 18 år anser att det är viktigt med miljö- och klimatundervisning i skolan. Skolan är också ungas främsta källa till information om klimatet.""Läs Novusundersökningen här 👇 www.mynewsdesk.com/se/varabarnsklimat/pressreleases/ny-novusundersoekning-aatta-av-tio-unga-vill-...🌎🌎🌎🌎🌎🌎🌎🌎🌎🌎🌎🌎🌎🌎🌎🌎🌎🌎🌎🌎🌎🌎🌎🌎✊Därför föreslår vi ett klimatlyft för alla Sveriges lärare – en nationell kompetenssatsning för att klimatrusta lärare, med fokus på grundskolan. I ett klimatlyft bör följande grundstenar ingå: 🔥Lärande. Se till att alla lärare får en god faktagrund att stå på gällande klimatförändringarna, den globala uppvärmningen och den ekologiska krisen, samt möjligheter till att uppdatera kunskaperna över tid. 🔥Mående. Rusta lärare för att lyfta fram och hantera barns och ungas känslor i samband med klimatundervisningen. Det är centralt för att skapa hopp, minska ensamhet och öka engagemanget. 🔥Handling. Utbilda lärare i hur skolan kan ta ett helhetsgrepp om klimatet med kollektiv handling i centrum. Att agera tillsammans med andra kan skapa framtidstro och handlingskraft hos elever. Agera du med!

It is a young organisation, founded in February 2013, but has already gathered over 600 individual members and over 20 member organisations. PUSH Sweden’s aim is to gather all Swedish youth organisations and young individuals who want to actively work for a long-term sustainable society, primarily in Sweden but of course also in the rest of the world. With a “long-term sustainable society” PUSH Sweden mean a society which is organized in a way that do not imperil future generations’ abilities to have a good life. We want a society which uses our shared resources in a sustainable and just way. With “just” we mean both global justice and intergenerational equity. A long-term sustainable society therefore imply both ecological, social and economic sustainability. PUSH Sweden wants to create a united and strong voice for the young people in Sweden who seek to solve the climate crisis, and further motivate and inspire more young people to actively engage in this matter. Through offering a platform and network projects come to life. The network is free for all youth who agree with our values’ platform. By offering meet-ups, trainings and collaborative platforms we help engaged youth to realise their own projects and ideas for a better future. We are enabling a new generation of changemakers.

PUSH Sverige består av en samling unga som har en gemensam värdegrund om en långsiktigt hållbar värld. (Läs vår värdegrund.) Vårt nätverk bygger helt på ideellt engagemang och på att våra medlemmar engagerar sig i det de brinner för, och brinner för det de engagerar sig i. PUSH Sverige har en uttalad önskan om att vara en demokratisk organisation med stort medlemsinflytande. Mycket av ansvaret för organisationens beslut är därför delegerat till våra arbetsgrupper och de regelbundna medlemsmöten. Alla som är med i nätverket är välkomna till medlemsmöten (som alltid är online) och att medverka i arbetsgrupperna. Utöver arbetsgrupperna finns en styrelse som har det yttersta formella ansvaret för organisationens ekonomi och andra juridiska grejer. Vi vill ha en decentraliserad (“platt”) organisation och försöker därför ha många små arbets- och projektgrupper med stor frihet under tilldelade befogenheter och ansvar. Men främst är PUSH Sverige vi som är medlemmar. Vi skapar ett stort nationellt, och många små lokala nätverk, och när det behövs så formar vi lokala eller nationella projektgrupper. Just nu finns en grupp för PUSH:s återkommande hållbarhetskonferens Power Shift, samt en för våra internationella samarbeten. Andra grupper skapas för olika tillfälliga kampanjer och samarbeten. Vi har också en önskan om att starta flera små lokala grupper. Just nu finns det aktiva lokalgrupper i Östersund, Göteborg, Stockholm och Malmö. Vill du starta en lokalgrupp så hör av dig till oss! info@pushsverige.se Varför finns PUSH? Många unga är idag oroade för framtiden. Hur ska vi förhindra klimatförändringar, finanskriser, fattigdom, resursbrist och orättvisor? Politiken agerar alldeles för långsamt och verkar inte ha insett allvaret i utmaningarna vi står inför. Det behövs en stark röst som berättar att det är dags att ta utmaningarna på allvar. PUSH Sverige vill samla alla som vill se en på riktigt hållbar värld. Tillsammans pushar vi Sverige! Hur uppstod PUSH? Idén till PUSH Sverige har vuxit fram ur det nätverk som skapades under de svenska Power Shift-konferenserna. PUSH Sverige och hemsidan lanserades i samband med Earth Hour i februari 2013 då PUSH också officiellt blev en ideell förening. Vi har ett antal styrande dokument och andra grejer som en måste ha som ideell förening. Mer om detta hittar du här. Vad gör PUSH? PUSH erbjuder sina medlemmar och stödmedlemmar flera olika funktioner, och tanken är i första hand att hjälpa till att visa upp allt medlemmarna arrangerar och är del av. Vi är som ett stort nätverk för allt ungt hållbarhetsengagemang! PUSH ordnar även en del egna saker och föreläser, håller workshops och deltar vid olika event och konferenser. För att få reda på vad PUSH gör just nu, kolla in vad vi har på gång här. På vår facebooksida sprider vi inspiration, fakta och info om och för medlemmar.

Contents 1 Mission and Methodology 1.1 An integrated approach to accelerate green infrastructure development and financing. 2 Governance Board 2.1 R20 - Regions of Climate Action (Association) 2.2 R20 Foundation 3 History 4 See also 5 References 6 Further reading 7 External links Mission and Methodology[edit] R20 founder Arnold Schwarzenegger speaks at the R20 AUSTRIAN WORLD SUMMIT 2017 in Vienna Founded on the principle that tackling climate change requires “Less talk, more action”, R20 works with a strong sense of immediacy to ensure that sub-national governments’ ability to mitigate and adapt to climate change is unlocked. While sub-national governments (provinces, regions, cities, etc.) are at the center of R20's work, the NGO recognizes that fast-tracking the transition to inclusive, resilient and low-carbon societies requires greater mobilization and collaboration between a wide range of stakeholders. This is why R20's approach aims to “connect the dots” and foster understanding and interconnection between policy-makers, clean technology providers and public-private investors throughout the whole project development value chain.[6] An integrated approach to accelerate green infrastructure development and financing.[edit] Through collaboration and with support from many partners, including the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, R20 has created a unique value chain approach that facilitates the identification, structuring, development (or bankability) and financing of green infrastructure projects.[7] Sub-national governments from around the world can benefit from this unique one stop shop to improve the sustainability of their regions. Project Identification: R20 works with sub-national governments and other networks of regions to identify potential green infrastructure projects and secure political support for their development. Project Structuring: Together with Foundations and academic institutions, R20 conducts workshops and training programs to facilitate the structuring and design of projects identified. Project Bankability: R20 works with its corporate partners to help project developers perform feasibility studies and ensure bankability of projects. Project Financing: R20 works with Foundations and Impact Fund Managers to provide and attract investment capital to fund project implementation. Project MRV: R20 works with MRV standards and implementer to Measure, Report and Verify projects contributions to GHG emission reduction and impact towards the SDGs.[8] Governance Board[edit] Since June 2017, R20 consists of R20 – Regions of Climate Action (Association) and the R20 Foundation, which work as two complementary entities. The association carries out day-to-day operational duties, and the foundation manages important investment decisions. R20 - Regions of Climate Action (Association)[edit] The R20 Association is legally structured as a Swiss association. On behalf of the General Assembly of members, the governing board carries out all acts that further the purpose of the organization and is responsible for managing the organization's business. The founding chair of the association is Arnold Schwarzenegger. The current president is Magnus Berntsson – president of the Regional Council of Västra Götaland and president of the AER (Assembly of European Regions)[9] and The Strategic Advisor to the Founding Chair is Terry Tamminen, CEO of the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation and the former secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency.[10] The R20 executive director is Dr. Christophe Nuttall, former director of the Hub for Innovative Partnerships at the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).[11][12] R20 Foundation[edit] The R20 Foundation is the entity responsible for almost all aspects of funding of the R20 Association and its operations. It was created at the request of a number of investors interested to invest in the R20 ecosystem of blended finance.[13] With a board of directors composed of green finance leaders, the R20 Foundation meets the demands of development banks, sovereign funds, private bans, private equities, family offices and pension funds. The current board is composed of Armand Jost, founder and CEO of SB3i (chairman), Dr. Patrick Scheurle, CEO of BlueOrchard Finance Ltd., Craig Cogut, chairman and president of Pegasus Capital Advisors, Dr. Andreas Mattner, chairman of the executive committee, «Lebendige Stadt» Foundation, Terry Tamminen, CEO of the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, Chrisophe Dossarps, CEO of the Sustainable Infrastructure Foundation and Dr. Frannie Léautier, founder and managing partner of Ezembat Group.[13] R20 is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland and benefits from a unique concentration of international organizations, financial institutions, NGOs and academia that the NGO can work with to further its mission. To facilitate and bring together local authorities, technology providers and investors, R20 works with regional offices installed around the world: Austria (Vienna), France (Paris), US (Santa Monica), Algeria (Oran), and Brazil (Rio de Janeiro). As of November 2016, R20 has 49 direct members (both national & sub-national authorities) and 134 businesses and project facilitators (academic institutions, national agencies, NGOs, private companies, UN programs and Intergovernmental organizations), and 41 investors and financial institutions.[14] History[edit] During his tenure as Governor of the State of California from 2003 to 2011, Arnold Schwarzenegger was responsible for signing into law groundbreaking legislation that translated the Kyoto Protocol into Californian law. This and other initiatives is what led President Obama to ask Governor Schwarzenegger to obtain similar commitments from thirty other US States. A. Schwarzenegger's success in implementing action at the sub-national level, and his ability to demonstrate the potential to scale this impact by replication at the sub-national level is ultimately what gave birth to the R20 Regions of Climate Action. In December 2009, after evaluating the failure of the COP15 to agree on the practical means to limit carbon emissions, Gov. Schwarzenegger, with the support from the UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon, decided to create a new coalition of Regions committed to action. He met with a number of heads of regions, including Governor Uduaghan from Delta State, Nigeria, President Charet from the Province of Quebec, Canada, President Huchon and Vice President Michèle Sabban from Region Ile de France, and 17 other representatives from other Regions, who all decided to create R20 Regions of Climate Action. In September 2010, Governor Schwarzenegger organized the Third Global Governors Climate Summit in Sacramento and launched the R20 Charter, which was signed by representatives of Regions, national governments, NGOs, foundations, private companies and finance institutions. In September 2011, the First constitutive General Assembly of R20 marked the official creation of the NGO.

While sub-national governments (provinces, regions, cities, etc.) are at the center of R20's work, the NGO recognizes that fast-tracking the transition to inclusive, resilient and low-carbon societies requires greater mobilization and collaboration between a wide range of stakeholders. This is why R20's approach aims to “connect the dots” and foster understanding and interconnection between policy-makers, clean technology providers and public-private investors throughout the whole project development value chain.[6] An integrated approach to accelerate green infrastructure development and financing.[edit] Through collaboration and with support from many partners, including the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, R20 has created a unique value chain approach that facilitates the identification, structuring, development (or bankability) and financing of green infrastructure projects.[7] Sub-national governments from around the world can benefit from this unique one stop shop to improve the sustainability of their regions. Project Identification: R20 works with sub-national governments and other networks of regions to identify potential green infrastructure projects and secure political support for their development. Project Structuring: Together with Foundations and academic institutions, R20 conducts workshops and training programs to facilitate the structuring and design of projects identified. Project Bankability: R20 works with its corporate partners to help project developers perform feasibility studies and ensure bankability of projects. Project Financing: R20 works with Foundations and Impact Fund Managers to provide and attract investment capital to fund project implementation. Project MRV: R20 works with MRV standards and implementer to Measure, Report and Verify projects contributions to GHG emission reduction and impact towards the SDGs.[8] Governance Board[edit] Since June 2017, R20 consists of R20 – Regions of Climate Action (Association) and the R20 Foundation, which work as two complementary entities. The association carries out day-to-day operational duties, and the foundation manages important investment decisions. R20 - Regions of Climate Action (Association)[edit] The R20 Association is legally structured as a Swiss association. On behalf of the General Assembly of members, the governing board carries out all acts that further the purpose of the organization and is responsible for managing the organization's business. The founding chair of the association is Arnold Schwarzenegger. The current president is Magnus Berntsson – president of the Regional Council of Västra Götaland and president of the AER (Assembly of European Regions)[9] and The Strategic Advisor to the Founding Chair is Terry Tamminen, CEO of the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation and the former secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency.[10] The R20 executive director is Dr. Christophe Nuttall, former director of the Hub for Innovative Partnerships at the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).[11][12] R20 Foundation[edit] The R20 Foundation is the entity responsible for almost all aspects of funding of the R20 Association and its operations. It was created at the request of a number of investors interested to invest in the R20 ecosystem of blended finance.[13] With a board of directors composed of green finance leaders, the R20 Foundation meets the demands of development banks, sovereign funds, private bans, private equities, family offices and pension funds. The current board is composed of Armand Jost, founder and CEO of SB3i (chairman), Dr. Patrick Scheurle, CEO of BlueOrchard Finance Ltd., Craig Cogut, chairman and president of Pegasus Capital Advisors, Dr. Andreas Mattner, chairman of the executive committee, «Lebendige Stadt» Foundation, Terry Tamminen, CEO of the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, Chrisophe Dossarps, CEO of the Sustainable Infrastructure Foundation and Dr. Frannie Léautier, founder and managing partner of Ezembat Group.[13] R20 is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland and benefits from a unique concentration of international organizations, financial institutions, NGOs and academia that the NGO can work with to further its mission. To facilitate and bring together local authorities, technology providers and investors, R20 works with regional offices installed around the world: Austria (Vienna), France (Paris), US (Santa Monica), Algeria (Oran), and Brazil (Rio de Janeiro). As of November 2016, R20 has 49 direct members (both national & sub-national authorities) and 134 businesses and project facilitators (academic institutions, national agencies, NGOs, private companies, UN programs and Intergovernmental organizations), and 41 investors and financial institutions.[14] History[edit] During his tenure as Governor of the State of California from 2003 to 2011, Arnold Schwarzenegger was responsible for signing into law groundbreaking legislation that translated the Kyoto Protocol into Californian law. This and other initiatives is what led President Obama to ask Governor Schwarzenegger to obtain similar commitments from thirty other US States. A. Schwarzenegger's success in implementing action at the sub-national level, and his ability to demonstrate the potential to scale this impact by replication at the sub-national level is ultimately what gave birth to the R20 Regions of Climate Action. In December 2009, after evaluating the failure of the COP15 to agree on the practical means to limit carbon emissions, Gov. Schwarzenegger, with the support from the UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon, decided to create a new coalition of Regions committed to action. He met with a number of heads of regions, including Governor Uduaghan from Delta State, Nigeria, President Charet from the Province of Quebec, Canada, President Huchon and Vice President Michèle Sabban from Region Ile de France, and 17 other representatives from other Regions, who all decided to create R20 Regions of Climate Action. In September 2010, Governor Schwarzenegger organized the Third Global Governors Climate Summit in Sacramento and launched the R20 Charter, which was signed by representatives of Regions, national governments, NGOs, foundations, private companies and finance institutions. In September 2011, the First constitutive General Assembly of R20 marked the official creation of the NGO. Linda Adam, The California Environmental Protection Agency State Secretary, was officially elected president of the R20 Board and Terry Tamminen was nominated as R20 special advisor to Governor Schwarzenegger, the honorary founding chair of R20. In January 2012, Dr. Christophe Nuttall, director of the UNDP Hub for Innovative Partnership, officially joined R20 as executive director.

R20 - Regions of Climate Action (R20), Ciudades Capitales de las Americas frente al Cambio Climatico Secretariado (CC35) and the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation (LDF) are combining their efforts to accelerate the identification, development and financing of sustainable infrastructure projects in Latin American and Caribbean regions and cities. Successfully transitioning to a form of development that protects the environment and enhances the well-being of populations in social, economic and health terms, requires unprecedented investments in sustainable infrastructure. In the most urbanized region of the planet. This need is particularly high at the city, state and regional levels, where mid-size projects, typically of between $5-50 million in construction costs, offer a unique opportunity to maximize sustainable development benefits. R20, CC35 and LDF are joining forces to foster sustainable infrastructure investments at the sub-national level in Latin America and the Caribbean. They intend to do so by deploying a technical and financial ecosystem, based on the “R20 Value Chain Approach” and tailored to the specific needs of the Latin American and Caribbean context. This effort will help to fast-track the identification, development and implementation of portfolios of projects on a scale that will facilitate connections to public, private, and institutional investors, while generating impact on a scale that will deliver the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Read the full press release here Annual report 2017 16 May 2019 0 Introduction At R20 - Regions of Climate Action, we believe that cities and regions play a central role in the fight against climate change and its impact. In particular, we believe that local and regional actors are uniquely positioned to implement the transition to a low-carbon green economy, whereby natural resources are conserved, fossil fuel use is limited, public health is protected and enhanced, while societies promote equality. Our efforts are designed to support sub-national governments around the world by developing and financing low-carbon and climate resilient infrastructure projects, such as renewable energy, energy efficient lighting and waste optimisation. Although local authorities are at the center of our work, we recognize that fast-tracking the transition to inclusive, resilient and low-carbon societies requires greater mobilization and collaboration between a wide range of stakeholders. Our approach aims to “connect the dots” and foster understanding and interconnection between policy-makers, clean technology providers and public-private investors throughout the whole project development value chain. Read the full report Annual report 2016 16 May 2019 0 Introduction Since its inception, R20 has led several successful projects in the fields of renewable energy, energy efficiency and waste management. R20’s vision and overarching goal for 2017-2020 includes scaling up the identification, development and financing of green infrastructure projects. In June 2016, R20 launched the very successful 100 Climate Solutions Project Campaign, which was supported by the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation. The campaign received more than 650 project applications, over 400 of which met R20’s initial screening criteria. In total, 81 countries are represented by the “100 Projects Campaign” portfolio, with a combined CAPEX of around 5 billion USD. The most successful projects identified under this campaign will be chosen for funding. More details of the campaign can be found on the following pages. The year 2016 was also a crucial time for climate negotiations. At COP 22, in spite of international political uncertainty, a newfound convergence of interests was forged between civil society, sub-national authorities, corporate players, public and private investors, inter-governmental organizations, and national governments to achieve the common goals of low carbon and climate resilient infrastructure. The following pages list the various R20 projects and programmes from around the world in 2016. Going forward, R20 will structure all its programmes and projects in line with its unique value chain, and work with all R20 members and partners to scale the identification, development and financing of green infrastructure projects. The R20 team looks forward to putting in place its full value chain in the coming years ahead, thereby fully aligning our mission with the results from and spirit of COP 22. View all the report Annual report 2015 16 May 2019 0 The year 2015 was crucial time for climate negotiations, with new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for 2030 and a new international agreement adopted at the Paris Climate Conference in December. The “Solutions’ Agenda” promoted by the French Government ahead of COP21 was key to convincing governments that climate change constitutes an opportunity for development, enabling the creation of new green jobs, innovative technologies, greater energy security, a preserved environment and improved health for populations world-wide. View all the report Annual report 2014 16 May 2019 0 Introduction R20’s bottom-up dynamic was presented by R20’s Founding Chair Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to the French President François Hollande, as complementary to the UNFCCC negotiations. As a result, it was agreed that in order to encourage the Parties to adopt the Solutions’ Agenda and help agree on a new climate regime, the French Government would work with R20 on a diplomatic, operational, and financial strategy to effectively contribute to COP21. This strategy will become part of the Road to Paris 2015, federating all forces at the sub-national level, including political figures, business, and financial leaders. These should form a strong global movement capable of evidencing concrete sub-national achievements and advocating for the adoption of a new international climate agreement in December 2015. In addition, R20 and other networks of regions have been collecting evidence of real projects and commitments taken at the sub-national level, to be presented at COP21 and demonstrating that cities and regions play a major role in complementing national efforts.

Sub-national priority areas may include: clean public transportation, energy-efficiency in public buildings, LED street lighting, wind energy, micro-hydro power, solar energy, and waste-conversion projects. Such projects often fall in the hands of mayors and/or leaders of districts, regions or provinces. Moreover, recent research published by UNDP shows that 75% of potential solutions for a low-carbon economy lie with sub-national governments.

Schwarzenegger, founder of R20 – Regions of Climate Action, a not-for-profit international organization established in 2011, bestowed the Prime Minister with the R20 Climate Warrior Award. The Prime Minister was recognised with the Award at the 5th Arnold Sports Festival celebrations being held in Melbourne, Australia on 15-17 March 2019. The Festival features 10,000 athletes competing in a variety of sports and events and was first debuted in Melbourne, Australia in 2015 under the Arnold Classic Australia programme. Whilst recognising the Prime Minister, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger stated that “the Arnold Sports Festival celebrates the pinnacle of fitness of the human body and Prime Minister Bainimarama’s contribution in championing the global fitness of our planet also deserves special recognition and appreciation. It is the first time the R20 Award is being given by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to anyone for climate action and it clearly recognises Prime Minister Bainimarama’s efforts in championing the fight against climate change, especially for island nations. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger [left] with Prime Minister Voreqe Bainimarama Arnold, who is also the Chair of the USC Schwarzenegger Institute and R20, has on several occasions partnered with the Prime Minister of Fiji and COP23 President to strengthen high level dialogue on climate action, one such collaboration being a Talanoa dialogue focusing on the impact of sub-national financial systems and explored how joint public-private financing can support low-carbon and climate resilient infrastructure in developing nations. The award was received by Luke Daunivalu, Fiji’s High Commissioner in Canberra, who conveyed the Prime Minister’s gratitude for the bestowment of the R20 Climate Warrior Award and reaffirmed that Fiji’s commitment to climate action is total and absolute.

The Uzere biogas digester project 13 May 2019 0 Introduction The Uzere Community in Delta State, Nigeria is one of the largest oil producing communities in the country. Oil exploration in Uzere began in 1957 with two oil fields and 43 oil wells, now producing 53,000 barrels of crude oil per day. But despite the presence of a well established oil industry, and therefore the availability of this fossil fuel, most of the rural population depends on burning fuelwood. Because of its accessibility and affordability, fuelwood is the main source of energy for cooking. The consistent use of wood in the rural communities of Delta State is by and large applicable to all communities in Nigeria. The rate of its consumption exceeds any afforestation programme of the federal, state and the local governments. The over dependence on forest wood as a domestic source of energy has greatly impacted the environment, leading to deforestation, high carbon emissions and health-related issues from inhaling harmful smoke. To address this issue, the Delta State Climate Change Department of the Ministry of Environment under the Territorial Approach to Climate Change (TACC), initiated a pilot project to provide biogas technology to rural households in Uzere community. The biogas digesters use agricultural waste and food scraps from the kitchen for the generation of clean, safe, reliable, and environmentally friendly energy.

The project seeks to address various problems, such as gender inequality, unemployment, extreme poverty, and degradation of natural resources. The project has been implemented in collaboration with local partners, mainly RUDI (Rural Urban Development Initiatives), a non-profit organization with several offices throughout Tanzania. Together with other local partners, R20 and RUDI were able to import a commercial solar oven technology manufactured in the United States (the “Villager Sun Oven”) into Tanzania. Once the technology had arrived, RUDI and the local partners trained local women on how to bake bread with the oven. They also established the framework of a bakery business plan, set up the bakery operations in a dedicated building, and ensured that the bakery became a legitimate small business by procuring the necessary permits. View all the article Integrated Solid Waste Management 13 May 2019 0 INTRODUCTION Waste is often considered a financial and environmental burden with no value, and when improperly managed, waste is hazardous to humans, the economy and the environment (both global and local). Municipalities around the world often face the same challenges when dealing with waste, from lacking or inadequate facilities, improper maintenance of, or faulty, equipment, scarce collection points, to over-reliance on landfill disposal, etc. With modern techniques and appropriate technology, municipal waste can be transformed to create economic value through recycling, re-use and/or conversion to energy. Not all waste needs to be wasted – materials such as plastics, aluminium, glass, textiles, biomass, or even sludge, can be reconverted into either raw materials or energy. Several techniques and technologies exist to add value to waste. A cooperation agreement was signed in 2013 with the Algerian government – between Arnold Schwarzenegger (on behalf of R20) and Mr Amara Benyounes (Algerian Minister for Environment), with the support of the Prime Minister, Mr. Abdelmalek Sellal – to make the Wilaya of Oran a model region for waste conversion programs. The agreement also covers plans to develop a series of bankable projects in waste management, energy efficiency and renewable energy. View all the article The Akugbene Water Filter Project 13 May 2019 0 Introduction Purpose This case study documents the deployment of biosand water filters to selected households in the Akugbene Community of the Bomadi Local Government Area of Delta State, Nigeria. The Akugbene water filter project aims to increase access to clean drinking water, reduce instances of water-borne illnesses, as well as limit local environmental damage caused by the use of fuel wood. Climate change, flooding, disease The majority of the scientific community agrees that anthropogenic activities have significantly altered, and continue to alter, the earth’s climate conditions. Intensive use of fossil fuels results in the emission of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. Greenhouse gases trap heat in the earth’s atmosphere, thus increasing the ambient temperature. This increase in temperature allows the atmosphere to become highly saturated with moisture, resulting in increased rainfall, and subsequent increased flooding. Flooding is associated with numerous negative environmental impacts, as well as ramifications throughout society as a whole. Damage to native biota, farmland, animals, and the displacement of people, are among many devastating affects of flooding. However, climate change and flooding also have a significant impact on human health. Increased flooding and runoff due to heavy rainfall leads to a decrease in the quality of surface waters, and may lead to microbiological contamination. Prior studies depict connections between heavy precipitation and waterborne outbreaks of disease, such as cryptosporidiosis and cholera. In addition to flooding, rising sea levels are another consequence of climate change that is responsible for the contamination of drinking water in the phreatic surface in coastal areas. Increased salinity levels in drinking water due to saltwater intrusion (even into boreholes)may negatively impact the health of those in the community, specifically high-risk groups such as women and children. View all the article Open burning of waste: a global health disaster 13 May 2019 0 Waste is a worldwide issue that is not likely to go away. Waste production rates have increased in recent years and are projected to increase significantly in the coming years to 2.2 billion tons per year in 2025, according to the World Bank. Open burning of waste is a process in which unwanted products, byproducts and materials are incinerated, typically at low temperatures and in an uncontrolled manner. It is used to reduce the quantity of waste. An estimated 41% of global waste is burned openly. In developing, low income countries that figure is even higher. Creating a well-executed waste collection program, or disposal mechanism is difficult in less economically developed countries. The practice is popular because it is a fast, effective and inexpensive way to reduce waste. Most open waste burning occurs residentially, is completely unregulated and, consequently, is nearly impossible to measure. An estimated 620 million tons of waste per year are burned openly. Much of the open waste burning occurs in dumpsites that have been filled far beyond their maximum capacity. Dumpsite waste fires are either started intentionally to reduce waste volume or occur spontaneously. Open burning of waste releases a variety of toxic pollutants into the air and also can exacerbate soil pollution, water pollution and food contamination. Open waste burning releases significant amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Such compounds include carbon dioxide, methane and particulate matter, which are typically associated with air pollution and can lead to severe cases of respiratory disease. Open burning of waste is especially associated with the emission of persistent organic pollutants. This includes polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, dioxins and furans, all of which are carcinogenic and have been linked to a variety of other diseases. The impacts of these iv pollutants are especially harmful to unborn fetuses, infants and children who come into contact with the pollutants either through their mothers or through exposure to the pollutants themselves. Consequently, several of the pollutants emitted by open waste burning can cause severe developmental damage in the young. Although not completely free from the public health impact of waste burning, the United States, Canada and most of Europe have minimal incidence of open waste burning. Regions marked by poor collection coverage and poor waste disposal methods are usually the poorer countries: Africa has 46% collection coverage, and South Asia has 65% collection coverage. These regions likely have the greatest percentage of residential open burning of waste, which is almost always coupled with open burning at dumpsites. Countries that are large generators of waste that still openly burn waste such as China, India and Brazil are particularly large producers of open waste burning emissions. There is no easy solution to the global health disaster that is open waste burning. Countries most negatively affected by open waste burning do not have the resources necessary to stop it. However, as the problem is only projected to get worse as more waste is produced worldwide, measures must be taken to prevent open waste burning where possible such as improved collection, improved disposal, recycling or general awareness of the dangers of open waste burning.

A group of 20 municipalities benefitted from the know-how of Romanian and Swiss experts through seminars helping them to develop realistic measures for reducing GHG emissions. CLOSE Faithful Cities Program The Faithful Cities initiative seeks to deliver green infrastructure and other practical solutions to holy cities, as well as to encourage a collective spirit of respect for the environment based on the religious and spiritual beliefs of pilgrims and tourists. Why pilgrim cities? The influence of the faiths and religions cannot be overstated. Around 80 percent of the planet’s population professes a religious or spiritual belief. Religious organizations are the largest social network in the world, with far reaching influence in health care, education, politics and the media. Of greater importance than their influence is the simple message that religions share across borders: our responsibility to care for a shared planet and to unite for a safe future for the next generations. Around the world, pilgrim cities welcome 350 million pilgrims every year, which exert significant pressure on infrastructure, sanitation, waste management, water supplies, etc. Faithful Cities will, in collaboration with the selected cities, show how these challenges can become opportunities for healthier, more prosperous and more resilient urban environments by way of innovative and readily actionable solutions. CLOSE Delta State, Nigeria - Territorial Approach to Climate Change (TACC) Programme Delta State, Nigeria – Territorial Approach to Climate Change (TACC) Programme R20 was the International Consultant for Delta State’s TACC Programme. This yielded the following results: Capacity building with the Delta State Ministry of Environment on low-carbon project development, GHG inventories and project financing Production and implementation of the Delta State Integrated Territorial Climate Plan (ITCP) Implementation of several pilot projects: household biogas digesters, household water filter projects, solar-powered health center, construction of eco-stoves Production of 3 studies: Action Plan for Large-scale Solar PV, Zero Waste Road Map, and Action Plan for Institutional Solar Thermal Water Heating CLOSE Dapeng New District, China – Waste Management Program Dapeng New District, China – Waste Management Program Following the signing of the contract in December 2014, R20 worked on operational and project planning for the Dapeng New District in Shenzhen. Throughout 2015, R20 collaborated closely with the Dapeng local government on an integrated municipal solid waste management project, in partnership with a Swiss engineering company. Since the completion of data collection activities on landfills, construction and demolition waste, organic waste, as well as household waste, R20 and its partner drafted pre-feasibility studies. The studies provide an analysis of the current municipal waste situation in Dapeng, as well as for three waste infrastructure projects. CLOSE R20 Fund for Women in the Green Economy This objective of this program is to provide financial support in the form of grants to green businesses, start-ups and small and medium size enterprises led by women, world-wide. Through this program, R20 and its partners aim to: Support low carbon projects led by women that create new green jobs and expand the green economy market; Support women entrepreneurs who developed pro-green products and services that improve the community’s quality of life, health, access to energy, etc; Build women’s political, technical and financial capacities and strengthen their green entrepreneurship in response to current climate challenges; Raise awareness on the challenges and opportunities of the green economy from a gender perspective, and on the solutions to be achieved through women’s empowerment and entrepreneurship. CLOSE Smart Cities Program It is a tremendous opportunity for municipalities across the world to adopt sustainable, modern solutions to improve conditions for both the city and their citizens. However, because this is a new trend, there is no definitive guide for a city to become “smart.” For this reason, R20 USA is researching and analyzing solutions and case studies, and sharing them with the appropriate stakeholders with the goal of developing real projects through our global network. To assist cities, R20 USA is working with city representatives to conduct an inventory of current practices (Smart City Survey) from which they can then identify potential avenues of collaboration. This survey serves as the first step in this Smart Cities Program. In addition, R20 USA and Seventh Generation Advisors are working together to introduce their global network of partners, governments, companies, financial institutions, and academic institutions to the future of the Smart City. CLOSE Kita Mali Kita, Mali 50 MW Solar PV Power Plant In 2015, R20, the Government of Mali, and Akuo Energy signed a contract to install a 50 MW solar pv power plant in Kita. Feasibility studies were conducted in 2015 and construction of the plant started in 2016. CLOSE several cities in Brazil Several cities in Brazil — LED Street Lighting Program This program involves working with over a dozen cities on retrofitting their streetlights to energy-saving LEDs. In December 2014, the Brazilian city of Nova Friburgo inaugurated this first pilot project to replace LEDs in the city. The city’s energy savings have reached 50%, and the cost of maintenance was cut by 40%. The project was a result of a partnership between R20, the State Department of Environment and the city of Nova Friburgo. In 2013, R20 invested $500,000 in philanthropic funds to the LED lamp energy efficiency project in Brazil. This amount was used to: Provide LED training to municipal managers and establish the lighting inventory of the cities to assess their potential to switch to LED; Invite LED manufacturers to Brazil to set up production in the country; Negotiate with the main electricity supplier and the municipality to test and approve new LED products; Identify an interested member of the R20 investor network, and structure a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), which will provide a US$ 500 million revolving loan fund to 13 cities to retrofit 1.5 million lamps. With the SPV, cities borrow money to replace lamps and repay the SPV through energy and maintenance savings. CLOSE We use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

Contents 1 Mission and Methodology 1.1 An integrated approach to accelerate green infrastructure development and financing. 2 Governance Board 2.1 R20 - Regions of Climate Action (Association) 2.2 R20 Foundation 3 History 4 See also 5 References 6 Further reading 7 External links Mission and Methodology[edit] R20 founder Arnold Schwarzenegger speaks at the R20 AUSTRIAN WORLD SUMMIT 2017 in Vienna Founded on the principle that tackling climate change requires “Less talk, more action”, R20 works with a strong sense of immediacy to ensure that sub-national governments’ ability to mitigate and adapt to climate change is unlocked. While sub-national governments (provinces, regions, cities, etc.) are at the center of R20's work, the NGO recognizes that fast-tracking the transition to inclusive, resilient and low-carbon societies requires greater mobilization and collaboration between a wide range of stakeholders. This is why R20's approach aims to “connect the dots” and foster understanding and interconnection between policy-makers, clean technology providers and public-private investors throughout the whole project development value chain.[6] An integrated approach to accelerate green infrastructure development and financing.[edit] Through collaboration and with support from many partners, including the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, R20 has created a unique value chain approach that facilitates the identification, structuring, development (or bankability) and financing of green infrastructure projects.[7] Sub-national governments from around the world can benefit from this unique one stop shop to improve the sustainability of their regions. Project Identification: R20 works with sub-national governments and other networks of regions to identify potential green infrastructure projects and secure political support for their development. Project Structuring: Together with Foundations and academic institutions, R20 conducts workshops and training programs to facilitate the structuring and design of projects identified. Project Bankability: R20 works with its corporate partners to help project developers perform feasibility studies and ensure bankability of projects. Project Financing: R20 works with Foundations and Impact Fund Managers to provide and attract investment capital to fund project implementation. Project MRV: R20 works with MRV standards and implementer to Measure, Report and Verify projects contributions to GHG emission reduction and impact towards the SDGs.[8] Governance Board[edit] Since June 2017, R20 consists of R20 – Regions of Climate Action (Association) and the R20 Foundation, which work as two complementary entities. The association carries out day-to-day operational duties, and the foundation manages important investment decisions. R20 - Regions of Climate Action (Association)[edit] The R20 Association is legally structured as a Swiss association. On behalf of the General Assembly of members, the governing board carries out all acts that further the purpose of the organization and is responsible for managing the organization's business. The founding chair of the association is Arnold Schwarzenegger. The current president is Magnus Berntsson – president of the Regional Council of Västra Götaland and president of the AER (Assembly of European Regions)[9] and The Strategic Advisor to the Founding Chair is Terry Tamminen, CEO of the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation and the former secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency.[10] The R20 executive director is Dr. Christophe Nuttall, former director of the Hub for Innovative Partnerships at the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).[11][12] R20 Foundation[edit] The R20 Foundation is the entity responsible for almost all aspects of funding of the R20 Association and its operations. It was created at the request of a number of investors interested to invest in the R20 ecosystem of blended finance.[13] With a board of directors composed of green finance leaders, the R20 Foundation meets the demands of development banks, sovereign funds, private bans, private equities, family offices and pension funds. The current board is composed of Armand Jost, founder and CEO of SB3i (chairman), Dr. Patrick Scheurle, CEO of BlueOrchard Finance Ltd., Craig Cogut, chairman and president of Pegasus Capital Advisors, Dr. Andreas Mattner, chairman of the executive committee, «Lebendige Stadt» Foundation, Terry Tamminen, CEO of the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, Chrisophe Dossarps, CEO of the Sustainable Infrastructure Foundation and Dr. Frannie Léautier, founder and managing partner of Ezembat Group.[13] R20 is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland and benefits from a unique concentration of international organizations, financial institutions, NGOs and academia that the NGO can work with to further its mission. To facilitate and bring together local authorities, technology providers and investors, R20 works with regional offices installed around the world: Austria (Vienna), France (Paris), US (Santa Monica), Algeria (Oran), and Brazil (Rio de Janeiro). As of November 2016, R20 has 49 direct members (both national & sub-national authorities) and 134 businesses and project facilitators (academic institutions, national agencies, NGOs, private companies, UN programs and Intergovernmental organizations), and 41 investors and financial institutions.[14] History[edit] During his tenure as Governor of the State of California from 2003 to 2011, Arnold Schwarzenegger was responsible for signing into law groundbreaking legislation that translated the Kyoto Protocol into Californian law. This and other initiatives is what led President Obama to ask Governor Schwarzenegger to obtain similar commitments from thirty other US States. A. Schwarzenegger's success in implementing action at the sub-national level, and his ability to demonstrate the potential to scale this impact by replication at the sub-national level is ultimately what gave birth to the R20 Regions of Climate Action. In December 2009, after evaluating the failure of the COP15 to agree on the practical means to limit carbon emissions, Gov. Schwarzenegger, with the support from the UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon, decided to create a new coalition of Regions committed to action. He met with a number of heads of regions, including Governor Uduaghan from Delta State, Nigeria, President Charet from the Province of Quebec, Canada, President Huchon and Vice President Michèle Sabban from Region Ile de France, and 17 other representatives from other Regions, who all decided to create R20 Regions of Climate Action. In September 2010, Governor Schwarzenegger organized the Third Global Governors Climate Summit in Sacramento and launched the R20 Charter, which was signed by representatives of Regions, national governments, NGOs, foundations, private companies and finance institutions. In September 2011, the First constitutive General Assembly of R20 marked the official creation of the NGO. Linda Adam, The California Environmental Protection Agency State Secretary, was officially elected president of the R20 Board and Terry Tamminen was nominated as R20 special advisor to Governor Schwarzenegger, the honorary founding chair of R20. In January 2012, Dr. Christophe Nuttall, director of the UNDP Hub for Innovative Partnership, officially joined R20 as executive director. From 2013 to 2017, Michèle Sabban took on the R20 presidency. In June 2017, Magnus Berntsson, president of the Regional Council of Västra Götaland and president of AER, was elected as the new R20 president.[15] Since 2017, R20 organises the annual climate conference Austrian World Summit in Vienna.

ROMANIA Green Cities – Green Regions Project Under this capacity-building program a study tour and workshop for Romanian authorities took place in Geneva in 2016. A group of 20 municipalities benefitted from the know-how of Romanian and Swiss experts through seminars helping them to develop realistic measures for reducing GHG emissions. CLOSE Faithful Cities Program The Faithful Cities initiative seeks to deliver green infrastructure and other practical solutions to holy cities, as well as to encourage a collective spirit of respect for the environment based on the religious and spiritual beliefs of pilgrims and tourists. Why pilgrim cities? The influence of the faiths and religions cannot be overstated. Around 80 percent of the planet’s population professes a religious or spiritual belief. Religious organizations are the largest social network in the world, with far reaching influence in health care, education, politics and the media. Of greater importance than their influence is the simple message that religions share across borders: our responsibility to care for a shared planet and to unite for a safe future for the next generations. Around the world, pilgrim cities welcome 350 million pilgrims every year, which exert significant pressure on infrastructure, sanitation, waste management, water supplies, etc. Faithful Cities will, in collaboration with the selected cities, show how these challenges can become opportunities for healthier, more prosperous and more resilient urban environments by way of innovative and readily actionable solutions. CLOSE Delta State, Nigeria - Territorial Approach to Climate Change (TACC) Programme Delta State, Nigeria – Territorial Approach to Climate Change (TACC) Programme R20 was the International Consultant for Delta State’s TACC Programme. This yielded the following results: Capacity building with the Delta State Ministry of Environment on low-carbon project development, GHG inventories and project financing Production and implementation of the Delta State Integrated Territorial Climate Plan (ITCP) Implementation of several pilot projects: household biogas digesters, household water filter projects, solar-powered health center, construction of eco-stoves Production of 3 studies: Action Plan for Large-scale Solar PV, Zero Waste Road Map, and Action Plan for Institutional Solar Thermal Water Heating CLOSE Dapeng New District, China – Waste Management Program Dapeng New District, China – Waste Management Program Following the signing of the contract in December 2014, R20 worked on operational and project planning for the Dapeng New District in Shenzhen. Throughout 2015, R20 collaborated closely with the Dapeng local government on an integrated municipal solid waste management project, in partnership with a Swiss engineering company. Since the completion of data collection activities on landfills, construction and demolition waste, organic waste, as well as household waste, R20 and its partner drafted pre-feasibility studies. The studies provide an analysis of the current municipal waste situation in Dapeng, as well as for three waste infrastructure projects. CLOSE R20 Fund for Women in the Green Economy This objective of this program is to provide financial support in the form of grants to green businesses, start-ups and small and medium size enterprises led by women, world-wide. Through this program, R20 and its partners aim to: Support low carbon projects led by women that create new green jobs and expand the green economy market; Support women entrepreneurs who developed pro-green products and services that improve the community’s quality of life, health, access to energy, etc; Build women’s political, technical and financial capacities and strengthen their green entrepreneurship in response to current climate challenges; Raise awareness on the challenges and opportunities of the green economy from a gender perspective, and on the solutions to be achieved through women’s empowerment and entrepreneurship. CLOSE Smart Cities Program It is a tremendous opportunity for municipalities across the world to adopt sustainable, modern solutions to improve conditions for both the city and their citizens. However, because this is a new trend, there is no definitive guide for a city to become “smart.” For this reason, R20 USA is researching and analyzing solutions and case studies, and sharing them with the appropriate stakeholders with the goal of developing real projects through our global network. To assist cities, R20 USA is working with city representatives to conduct an inventory of current practices (Smart City Survey) from which they can then identify potential avenues of collaboration. This survey serves as the first step in this Smart Cities Program. In addition, R20 USA and Seventh Generation Advisors are working together to introduce their global network of partners, governments, companies, financial institutions, and academic institutions to the future of the Smart City. CLOSE Kita Mali Kita, Mali 50 MW Solar PV Power Plant In 2015, R20, the Government of Mali, and Akuo Energy signed a contract to install a 50 MW solar pv power plant in Kita. Feasibility studies were conducted in 2015 and construction of the plant started in 2016. CLOSE several cities in Brazil Several cities in Brazil — LED Street Lighting Program This program involves working with over a dozen cities on retrofitting their streetlights to energy-saving LEDs. In December 2014, the Brazilian city of Nova Friburgo inaugurated this first pilot project to replace LEDs in the city. The city’s energy savings have reached 50%, and the cost of maintenance was cut by 40%. The project was a result of a partnership between R20, the State Department of Environment and the city of Nova Friburgo. In 2013, R20 invested $500,000 in philanthropic funds to the LED lamp energy efficiency project in Brazil. This amount was used to: Provide LED training to municipal managers and establish the lighting inventory of the cities to assess their potential to switch to LED; Invite LED manufacturers to Brazil to set up production in the country; Negotiate with the main electricity supplier and the municipality to test and approve new LED products; Identify an interested member of the R20 investor network, and structure a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), which will provide a US$ 500 million revolving loan fund to 13 cities to retrofit 1.5 million lamps. With the SPV, cities borrow money to replace lamps and repay the SPV through energy and maintenance savings. CLOSE We use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

With an estimated 2020 population of 8,253,213 distributed over about 302.6 square miles (784 km2), New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States.[11][12] Located at the southern tip of the State of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, the largest metropolitan area in the world by urban area.[13] With almost 20 million people in its metropolitan statistical area and approximately 23 million in its combined statistical area, it is one of the world's most populous megacities. New York City has been described as the cultural, financial, and media capital of the world, significantly influencing commerce,[14] entertainment, research, technology, education, politics, tourism, art, fashion, and sports, and is the most photographed city in the world.[15] Home to the headquarters of the United Nations,[16] New York is an important center for international diplomacy,[17][18] and has sometimes been called the capital of the world.[19][20] Situated on one of the world's largest natural harbors, New York City is composed of five boroughs, each of which is a county of the State of New York. The five boroughs—Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, the Bronx, and Staten Island—were created when local governments were consolidated into a single city in 1898.[21] The city and its metropolitan area constitute the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United States. As many as 800 languages are spoken in New York,[22] making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world. New York is home to more than 3.2 million residents born outside the United States,[23] the largest foreign-born population of any city in the world as of 2016.[24][25] As of 2019[update], the New York metropolitan area is estimated to produce a gross metropolitan product (GMP) of $2.0 trillion. If the New York metropolitan area were a sovereign state, it would have the eighth-largest economy in the world. New York is home to the highest number of billionaires of any city in the world.[26] New York City traces its origins to a trading post founded on the southern tip of Manhattan Island by Dutch colonists in 1624. The settlement was named New Amsterdam (Dutch: Nieuw Amsterdam) in 1626 and was chartered as a city in 1653.[27] The city came under English control in 1664 and was renamed New York after King Charles II of England granted the lands to his brother, the Duke of York.[27][28] The city was regained by the Dutch in July 1673 and was renamed New Orange for one year and three months; the city has been continuously named New York since November 1674.[29][30] New York City was the capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790,[31] and has been the largest U.S. city since 1790.[32] The Statue of Liberty greeted millions of immigrants as they came to the U.S. by ship in the late 19th and early 20th centuries,[33] and is a symbol of the U.S. and its ideals of liberty and peace.[34] In the 21st century, New York has emerged as a global node of creativity, entrepreneurship,[35] and environmental sustainability,[36][37] and as a symbol of freedom and cultural diversity.[38] In 2019, New York was voted the greatest city in the world per a survey of over 30,000 people from 48 cities worldwide, citing its cultural diversity.[39] Many districts and landmarks in New York City are well known, including three of the world's ten most visited tourist attractions in 2013.[40] A record 62.8 million tourists visited New York City in 2017. Times Square is the brightly illuminated hub of the Broadway Theater District,[41] one of the world's busiest pedestrian intersections,[42][43] and a major center of the world's entertainment industry.[44] Many of the city's landmarks, skyscrapers,[45] and parks are known around the world. The Empire State Building has become the global standard of reference to describe the height and length of other structures.[46][47][48] Manhattan's real estate market is among the most expensive in the world.[49][50] Providing continuous 24/7 service and contributing to the nickname The City That Never Sleeps, the New York City Subway is the largest single-operator rapid transit system worldwide, with 472 rail stations. The city has over 120 colleges and universities, including Columbia University, New York University, Rockefeller University, and the City University of New York system, which is the largest urban public university system in the United States.[51] Anchored by Wall Street in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, New York City has been called both the world's leading financial center and the most financially powerful city in the world, and is home to the world's two largest stock exchanges by total market capitalization, the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ.[52][53] Contents 1 Etymology 2 History 2.1 Early history 2.2 Dutch rule 2.3 English rule 2.4 Province of New York 2.5 American Revolution 2.6 Nineteenth century 2.7 Modern history 3 Geography 3.1 Boroughs 3.1.1 Manhattan 3.1.2 Brooklyn 3.1.3 Queens 3.1.4 The Bronx 3.1.5 Staten Island 3.2 Architecture 3.3 Climate 3.4 Parks 3.4.1 National parks 3.4.2 State parks 3.4.3 City parks 3.5 Military installations 4 Demographics 4.1 Population density 4.2 Race and ethnicity 4.3 Sexual orientation and gender identity 4.4 Religion 4.5 Wealth and income disparity 5 Economy 5.1 Wall Street 5.2 Tech and biotech 5.3 Real estate 5.4 Tourism 5.5 Media and entertainment 6 Education and scholarly activity 6.1 Primary and secondary education 6.2 Higher education and research 7 Human resources 7.1 Public health 7.2 Public safety 7.2.1 Police and law enforcement 7.2.2 Firefighting 7.3 Public library system 8 Culture and contemporary life 8.1 Pace 8.2 Arts 8.2.1 Performing arts 8.2.2 Visual arts 8.3 Cuisine 8.4 Parades 8.5 Accent and dialect 8.6 Sports 9 Environment 9.1 Environmental impact reduction 9.2 Water purity and availability 9.3 Air quality 9.4 Environmental revitalization 10 Government and politics 10.1 Government 10.2 Politics 11 Transportation 11.1 Rapid transit 11.1.1 Rail 11.1.2 Buses 11.2 Air 11.3 Ferries 11.4 Taxis, vehicles for hire, and trams 11.5 Streets and highways 11.5.1 River crossings 11.6 Cycling network 12 Notable people 13 Global outreach 14 See also 15 Notes 16 References 17 Further reading 18 External links Etymology In 1664, the city was named in honor of the Duke of York, who would become King James II of England.[54] James's older brother, King Charles II, appointed the Duke proprietor of the former territory of New Netherland, including the city of New Amsterdam, when England seized it from the Dutch.[55] History Main articles: History of New York City and Timeline of New York City Early history In the precolonial era, the area of present-day New York City was inhabited by Algonquian Native Americans, including the Lenape. Their homeland, known as Lenapehoking, included Staten Island, Manhattan, the Bronx, the western portion of Long Island (including the areas that would later become the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens), and the Lower Hudson Valley.[56] The first documented visit into New York Harbor by a European was in 1524 by Italian Giovanni da Verrazzano, a explorer from Florence in the service of the French crown.[57] He claimed the area for France and named it Nouvelle Angoulême (New Angoulême).[58] A Spanish expedition, led by the Portuguese captain Estêvão Gomes sailing for Emperor Charles V, arrived in New York Harbor in January 1525 and charted the mouth of the Hudson River, which he named Río de San Antonio (Saint Anthony's River). The Padrón Real of 1527, the first scientific map to show the East Coast of North America continuously, was informed by Gomes' expedition and labeled the northeastern United States as Tierra de Esteban Gómez in his honor.[59] In 1609, the English explorer Henry Hudson rediscovered New York Harbor while searching for the Northwest Passage to the Orient for the Dutch East India Company.[60] He proceeded to sail up what the Dutch would name the North River (now the Hudson River), named first by Hudson as the Mauritius after Maurice, Prince of Orange. Hudson's first mate described the harbor as ""a very good Harbour for all windes"" and the river as ""a mile broad"" and ""full of fish"".[61] Hudson sailed roughly 150 miles (240 km) north,[62] past the site of the present-day New York State capital city of Albany, in the belief that it might be an oceanic tributary before the river became too shallow to continue.[61] He made a ten-day exploration of the area and claimed the region for the Dutch East India Company. In 1614, the area between Cape Cod and Delaware Bay was claimed by the Netherlands and called Nieuw-Nederland (New Netherland). The first non–Native American inhabitant of what would eventually become New York City was Juan Rodriguez (transliterated to Dutch as Jan Rodrigues), a merchant from Santo Domingo. Born in Santo Domingo of Portuguese and African descent, he arrived in Manhattan during the winter of 1613–14, trapping for pelts and trading with the local population as a representative of the Dutch. Broadway, from 159th Street to 218th Street in Upper Manhattan, is named Juan Rodriguez Way in his honor.[63][64] Dutch rule A permanent European presence near New York Harbor began in 1624—making New York the 12th oldest continuously occupied European-established settlement in the continental United States[65]—with the founding of a Dutch fur trading settlement on Governors Island. In 1625, construction was started on a citadel and Fort Amsterdam, later called Nieuw Amsterdam (New Amsterdam), on present-day Manhattan Island.[66][67] The colony of New Amsterdam was centered on what would later be known as Lower Manhattan. It extended from the lower tip of Manhattan to modern day Wall Street, where a 12-foot wooden stockade was built in 1653 to protect against Native American and British raids.[68] In 1626, the Dutch colonial Director-General Peter Minuit, acting as charged by the Dutch West India Company, purchased the island of Manhattan from the Canarsie, a small Lenape band,[69] for ""the value of 60 guilders""[70] (about $900 in 2018).[71] A disproved legend claims that Manhattan was purchased for $24 worth of glass beads.[72][73] Following the purchase, New Amsterdam grew slowly.[74] To attract settlers, the Dutch instituted the patroon system in 1628, whereby wealthy Dutchmen (patroons, or patrons) who brought 50 colonists to New Netherland would be awarded swaths of land, along with local political autonomy and rights to participate in the lucrative fur trade. This program had little success.[75] Since 1621, the Dutch West India Company had operated as a monopoly in New Netherland, on authority granted by the Dutch States General. In 1639–1640, in an effort to bolster economic growth, the Dutch West India Company relinquished its monopoly over the fur trade, leading to growth in the production and trade of food, timber, tobacco, and slaves (particularly with the Dutch West Indies).[74][76] In 1647, Peter Stuyvesant began his tenure as the last Director-General of New Netherland. During his tenure, the population of New Netherland grew from 2,000 to 8,000.[77][78] Stuyvesant has been credited with improving law and order in the colony; however, he also earned a reputation as a despotic leader. He instituted regulations on liquor sales, attempted to assert control over the Dutch Reformed Church, and blocked other religious groups (including Quakers, Jews, and Lutherans) from establishing houses of worship.[79] The Dutch West India Company would eventually attempt to ease tensions between Stuyvesant and residents of New Amsterdam.[80] English rule In 1664, unable to summon any significant resistance, Stuyvesant surrendered New Amsterdam to English troops, led by Colonel Richard Nicolls, without bloodshed.[79][80] The terms of the surrender permitted Dutch residents to remain in the colony and allowed for religious freedom.[81] In 1667, during negotiations leading to the Treaty of Breda after the Second Anglo-Dutch War, the Dutch decided to keep the nascent plantation colony of what is now Suriname (on the northern South America coast) they had gained from the English; and in return, the English kept New Amsterdam. The fledgling settlement was promptly renamed ""New York"" after the Duke of York (the future King James II and VII), who would eventually be deposed in the Glorious Revolution.[82] After the founding, the duke gave part of the colony to proprietors George Carteret and John Berkeley. Fort Orange, 150 miles (240 km) north on the Hudson River, was renamed Albany after James's Scottish title.[83] The transfer was confirmed in 1667 by the Treaty of Breda, which concluded the Second Anglo-Dutch War.[84] On August 24, 1673, during the Third Anglo-Dutch War, Dutch captain Anthony Colve seized the colony of New York from the English at the behest of Cornelis Evertsen the Youngest and rechristened it ""New Orange"" after William III, the Prince of Orange.[85] The Dutch would soon return the island to England under the Treaty of Westminster of November 1674.[86][87] Several intertribal wars among the Native Americans and some epidemics brought on by contact with the Europeans caused sizeable population losses for the Lenape between the years 1660 and 1670.[88] By 1700, the Lenape population had diminished to 200.[89] New York experienced several yellow fever epidemics in the 18th century, losing ten percent of its population to the disease in 1702 alone.[90][91] Province of New York Columbia University was founded by royal charter in 1754 under the name of King's College. New York grew in importance as a trading port while as a part of the colony of New York in the early 1700s.[92] It also became a center of slavery, with 42% of households holding slaves by 1730, the highest percentage outside Charleston, South Carolina.[93] Most slaveholders held a few or several domestic slaves, but others hired them out to work at labor. Slavery became integrally tied to New York's economy through the labor of slaves throughout the port, and the banks and shipping tied to the American South. Discovery of the African Burying Ground in the 1990s, during construction of a new federal courthouse near Foley Square, revealed that tens of thousands of Africans had been buried in the area in the colonial period.[94] The 1735 trial and acquittal in Manhattan of John Peter Zenger, who had been accused of seditious libel after criticizing colonial governor William Cosby, helped to establish the freedom of the press in North America.[95] In 1754, Columbia University was founded under charter by King George II as King's College in Lower Manhattan.[96] American Revolution The Stamp Act Congress met in New York in October 1765, as the Sons of Liberty, organized in the city, skirmished over the next ten years with British troops stationed there.[97] The Battle of Long Island, the largest battle of the American Revolutionary War, was fought in August 1776 within the modern-day borough of Brooklyn.[98] After the battle, in which the Americans were defeated, the British made the city their military and political base of operations in North America. The city was a haven for Loyalist refugees and escaped slaves who joined the British lines for freedom newly promised by the Crown for all fighters. As many as 10,000 escaped slaves crowded into the city during the British occupation. When the British forces evacuated at the close of the war in 1783, they transported 3,000 freedmen for resettlement in Nova Scotia.[99] They resettled other freedmen in England and the Caribbean. The Battle of Long Island, the largest battle of the American Revolution, took place in Brooklyn in 1776. The only attempt at a peaceful solution to the war took place at the Conference House on Staten Island between American delegates, including Benjamin Franklin, and British general Lord Howe on September 11, 1776. Shortly after the British occupation began, the Great Fire of New York occurred, a large conflagration on the West Side of Lower Manhattan, which destroyed about a quarter of the buildings in the city, including Trinity Church.[100] In 1785, the assembly of the Congress of the Confederation made New York City the national capital shortly after the war. New York was the last capital of the U.S. under the Articles of Confederation and the first capital under the Constitution of the United States. New York City as the U.S. capital hosted several events of national scope in 1789—the first President of the United States, George Washington, was inaugurated; the first United States Congress and the Supreme Court of the United States each assembled for the first time; and the United States Bill of Rights was drafted, all at Federal Hall on Wall Street.[101] By 1790, New York had surpassed Philadelphia to become the largest city in the United States, but by the end of that year, pursuant to the Residence Act, the national capital was moved to Philadelphia.[102][103] Nineteenth century Broadway follows the Native American Wickquasgeck Trail through Manhattan.[104]Over the course of the nineteenth century, New York City's population grew from 60,000 to 3.43 million.[105] Under New York State's abolition act of 1799, children of slave mothers were to be eventually liberated but to be held in indentured servitude until their mid-to-late twenties.[106][107] Together with slaves freed by their masters after the Revolutionary War and escaped slaves, a significant free-Black population gradually developed in Manhattan. Under such influential United States founders as Alexander Hamilton and John Jay, the New York Manumission Society worked for abolition and established the African Free School to educate Black children.[108] It was not until 1827 that slavery was completely abolished in the state, and free Blacks struggled afterward with discrimination. New York interracial abolitionist activism continued; among its leaders were graduates of the African Free School. New York city's population jumped from 123,706 in 1820 to 312,710 by 1840, 16,000 of whom were Black.[109][110] In the 19th century, the city was transformed by development relating to its status as a national and international trading center, as well as by European immigration.[111] The city adopted the Commissioners' Plan of 1811, which expanded the city street grid to encompass almost all of Manhattan. The 1825 completion of the Erie Canal through central New York connected the Atlantic port to the agricultural markets and commodities of the North American interior via the Hudson River and the Great Lakes.[112] Local politics became dominated by Tammany Hall, a political machine supported by Irish and German immigrants.[113] Several prominent American literary figures lived in New York during the 1830s and 1840s, including William Cullen Bryant, Washington Irving, Herman Melville, Rufus Wilmot Griswold, John Keese, Nathaniel Parker Willis, and Edgar Allan Poe. Public-minded members of the contemporaneous business elite lobbied for the establishment of Central Park, which in 1857 became the first landscaped park in an American city. The Great Irish Famine brought a large influx of Irish immigrants; more than 200,000 were living in New York by 1860, upwards of a quarter of the city's population.[114] There was also extensive immigration from the German provinces, where revolutions had disrupted societies, and Germans comprised another 25% of New York's population by 1860.[115] Democratic Party candidates were consistently elected to local office, increasing the city's ties to the South and its dominant party. In 1861, Mayor Fernando Wood called upon the aldermen to declare independence from Albany and the United States after the South seceded, but his proposal was not acted on.[108] Anger at new military conscription laws during the American Civil War (1861–1865), which spared wealthier men who could afford to pay a $300 (equivalent to $6,306 in 2020) commutation fee to hire a substitute,[116] led to the Draft Riots of 1863, whose most visible participants were ethnic Irish working class.[108] The draft riots deteriorated into attacks on New York's elite, followed by attacks on Black New Yorkers and their property after fierce competition for a decade between Irish immigrants and Black people for work. Rioters burned the Colored Orphan Asylum to the ground, with more than 200 children escaping harm due to efforts of the New York Police Department, which was mainly made up of Irish immigrants.[115] At least 120 people were killed.[117] Eleven Black men were lynched over five days, and the riots forced hundreds of Blacks to flee the city for Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and New Jersey. The Black population in Manhattan fell below 10,000 by 1865, which it had last been in 1820. The White working class had established dominance.[115][117] Violence by longshoremen against Black men was especially fierce in the docks area.[115] It was one of the worst incidents of civil unrest in American history.[118] Modern history A construction worker atop the Empire State Building as it was being built in 1930. The Chrysler Building is behind him. In 1898, the modern City of New York was formed with the consolidation of Brooklyn (until then a separate city), the County of New York (which then included parts of the Bronx), the County of Richmond, and the western portion of the County of Queens.[119] The opening of the subway in 1904, first built as separate private systems, helped bind the new city together.[120] Throughout the first half of the 20th century, the city became a world center for industry, commerce, and communication.[121] In 1904, the steamship General Slocum caught fire in the East River, killing 1,021 people on board.[122] In 1911, the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, the city's worst industrial disaster, took the lives of 146 garment workers and spurred the growth of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union and major improvements in factory safety standards.[123] New York's non-White population was 36,620 in 1890.[124] New York City was a prime destination in the early twentieth century for African Americans during the Great Migration from the American South, and by 1916, New York City had become home to the largest urban African diaspora in North America.[125] The Harlem Renaissance of literary and cultural life flourished during the era of Prohibition.[126] The larger economic boom generated construction of skyscrapers competing in height and creating an identifiable skyline. New York became the most populous urbanized area in the world in the early-1920s, overtaking London. The metropolitan area surpassed the 10 million mark in the early-1930s, becoming the first megacity in human history.[127] The difficult years of the Great Depression saw the election of reformer Fiorello La Guardia as mayor and the fall of Tammany Hall after eighty years of political dominance.[128] Returning World War II veterans created a post-war economic boom and the development of large housing tracts in eastern Queens and Nassau County as well as similar suburban areas in New Jersey. New York emerged from the war unscathed as the leading city of the world, with Wall Street leading America's place as the world's dominant economic power. The United Nations Headquarters was completed in 1952, solidifying New York's global geopolitical influence, and the rise of abstract expressionism in the city precipitated New York's displacement of Paris as the center of the art world.[129] The Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village, a designated U.S. National Historic Landmark and National Monument, as the site of the June 1969 Stonewall riots and the cradle of the modern gay rights movement.[130][131][132] The Stonewall riots were a series of spontaneous, violent demonstrations by members of the gay community against a police raid that took place in the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, at the Stonewall Inn in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Lower Manhattan.[133] They are widely considered to constitute the single most important event leading to the gay liberation movement[130][134][135][136] and the modern fight for LGBT rights.[137][138] Wayne R. Dynes, author of the Encyclopedia of Homosexuality, wrote that drag queens were the only ""transgender folks around"" during the June 1969 Stonewall riots. The transgender community in New York City played a significant role in fighting for LGBT equality during the period of the Stonewall riots and thereafter.[139] In the 1970s, job losses due to industrial restructuring caused New York City to suffer from economic problems and rising crime rates.[140] While a resurgence in the financial industry greatly improved the city's economic health in the 1980s, New York's crime rate continued to increase through that decade and into the beginning of the 1990s.[141] By the mid 1990s, crime rates started to drop dramatically due to revised police strategies, improving economic opportunities, gentrification, and new residents, both American transplants and new immigrants from Asia and Latin America. Important new sectors, such as Silicon Alley, emerged in the city's economy.[142] New York's population reached all-time highs in the 2000 census and then again in the 2010 census. United Airlines Flight 175 hits the South Tower of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. New York City suffered the bulk of the economic damage and largest loss of human life in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks.[143] Two of the four airliners hijacked that day were flown into the twin towers of the World Trade Center, destroying them and killing 2,192 civilians, 343 firefighters, and 71 law enforcement officers. The North Tower became the tallest building ever to be destroyed anywhere then or subsequently.[144] The area was rebuilt with a new One World Trade Center, a 9/11 memorial and museum, and other new buildings and infrastructure.[145] The World Trade Center PATH station, which had opened on July 19, 1909 as the Hudson Terminal, was also destroyed in the attacks. A temporary station was built and opened on November 23, 2003. An 800,000-square-foot (74,000 m2) permanent rail station designed by Santiago Calatrava, the World Trade Center Transportation Hub, the city's third-largest hub, was completed in 2016.[146] The new One World Trade Center is the tallest skyscraper in the Western Hemisphere[147] and the sixth-tallest building in the world by pinnacle height, with its spire reaching a symbolic 1,776 feet (541.3 m) in reference to the year of U.S. independence.[148][149][150][151] The Occupy Wall Street protests in Zuccotti Park in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan began on September 17, 2011, receiving global attention and popularizing the Occupy movement against social and economic inequality worldwide.[152] In March 2020, the first case of COVID-19 in the city was confirmed in Manhattan.[153] The city rapidly became the global epicenter of the pandemic during the early phase, before the infection became widespread across the world and the rest of the nation. As of March 2021, New York City has recorded over 30,000 deaths from COVID-19-related complications. Geography Main articles: Geography of New York City and Geography of New York–New Jersey Harbor Estuary The core of the New York City metropolitan area, with Manhattan Island at its center. During the Wisconsin glaciation, 75,000 to 11,000 years ago, the New York City area was situated at the edge of a large ice sheet over 2,000 feet (610 m) in depth.[154] The erosive forward movement of the ice (and its subsequent retreat) contributed to the separation of what is now Long Island and Staten Island. That action also left bedrock at a relatively shallow depth, providing a solid foundation for most of Manhattan's skyscrapers.[155] New York City is situated in the northeastern United States, in southeastern New York State, approximately halfway between Washington, D.C. and Boston. The location at the mouth of the Hudson River, which feeds into a naturally sheltered harbor and then into the Atlantic Ocean, has helped the city grow in significance as a trading port. Most of New York City is built on the three islands of Long Island, Manhattan, and Staten Island. The Hudson River flows through the Hudson Valley into New York Bay. Between New York City and Troy, New York, the river is an estuary.[156] The Hudson River separates the city from the U.S. state of New Jersey. The East River—a tidal strait—flows from Long Island Sound and separates the Bronx and Manhattan from Long Island. The Harlem River, another tidal strait between the East and Hudson rivers, separates most of Manhattan from the Bronx. The Bronx River, which flows through the Bronx and Westchester County, is the only entirely freshwater river in the city.[157] The city's land has been altered substantially by human intervention, with considerable land reclamation along the waterfronts since Dutch colonial times; reclamation is most prominent in Lower Manhattan, with developments such as Battery Park City in the 1970s and 1980s.[158] Some of the natural relief in topography has been evened out, especially in Manhattan.[159] The city's total area is 468.484 square miles (1,213.37 km2); 302.643 sq mi (783.84 km2) of the city is land and 165.841 sq mi (429.53 km2) of this is water.[160][161] The highest point in the city is Todt Hill on Staten Island, which, at 409.8 feet (124.9 m) above sea level, is the highest point on the eastern seaboard south of Maine.[162] The summit of the ridge is mostly covered in woodlands as part of the Staten Island Greenbelt.[163] Boroughs Main articles: Boroughs of New York City and Neighborhoods in New York City 1.

If the boroughs were each independent cities, four of the boroughs (Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, and the Bronx) would be among the ten most populous cities in the United States (Staten Island would be ranked 37th as of 2020); these same boroughs are coterminous with the four most densely populated counties in the United States: New York (Manhattan), Kings (Brooklyn), Bronx, and Queens. Manhattan Lower and Midtown Manhattan, as seen by a SkySat satellite in 2017 Manhattan (New York County) is the geographically smallest and most densely populated borough, is home to Central Park and most of the city's skyscrapers, and is sometimes locally known as The City.[168] Manhattan's population density of 72,033 people per square mile (27,812/km2) in 2015 makes it the highest of any county in the United States and higher than the density of any individual American city.[169] Manhattan is the cultural, administrative, and financial center of New York City and contains the headquarters of many major multinational corporations, the United Nations Headquarters, Wall Street, and a number of important universities. The borough of Manhattan is often described as the financial and cultural center of the world.[170][171] Most of the borough is situated on Manhattan Island, at the mouth of the Hudson River. Several small islands also compose part of the borough of Manhattan, including Randall's Island, Wards Island, and Roosevelt Island in the East River, and Governors Island and Liberty Island to the south in New York Harbor. Manhattan Island is loosely divided into the Lower, Midtown, and Uptown regions. Uptown Manhattan is divided by Central Park into the Upper East Side and the Upper West Side, and above the park is Harlem, bordering the Bronx (Bronx County). Harlem was predominantly occupied by Jewish and Italian Americans in the 19th century until the Great Migration. It was the center of the Harlem Renaissance. The borough of Manhattan also includes a small neighborhood on the mainland, called Marble Hill, which is contiguous with the Bronx. New York City's remaining four boroughs are collectively referred to as the Outer Boroughs.

Brooklyn is known for its cultural, social, and ethnic diversity, an independent art scene, distinct neighborhoods, and a distinctive architectural heritage. Downtown Brooklyn is the largest central core neighborhood in the Outer Boroughs. The borough has a long beachfront shoreline including Coney Island, established in the 1870s as one of the earliest amusement grounds in the U.S.[172] Marine Park and Prospect Park are the two largest parks in Brooklyn.[173] Since 2010, Brooklyn has evolved into a thriving hub of entrepreneurship and high technology startup firms,[174][175] and of postmodern art and design.[175][176] Downtown Brooklyn skyline from Governors Island in September 2016. Queens Queens (Queens County), on Long Island north and east of Brooklyn, is geographically the largest borough, the most ethnically diverse county in the United States,[177] and the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world.[178][179] Historically a collection of small towns and villages founded by the Dutch, the borough has since developed both commercial and residential prominence. Downtown Flushing has become one of the busiest central core neighborhoods in the outer boroughs. Queens is the site of Citi Field, the baseball stadium of the New York Mets, and hosts the annual U.S. Open tennis tournament at Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. Additionally, two of the three busiest airports serving the New York metropolitan area, John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport, are located in Queens. The third is Newark Liberty International Airport in Newark, New Jersey. The Bronx The Bronx (Bronx County) is New York City's northernmost borough and the only New York City borough that lies mainly on the mainland United States. It is the location of Yankee Stadium, the baseball park of the New York Yankees, and home to the largest cooperatively owned housing complex in the United States, Co-op City.[180] It is also home to the Bronx Zoo, the world's largest metropolitan zoo,[181] which spans 265 acres (1.07 km2) and houses more than 6,000 animals.[182] The Bronx is also the birthplace of hip hop music and culture.[183] Pelham Bay Park is the largest park in New York City, at 2,772 acres (1,122 ha).[184] Staten Island Staten Island (Richmond County) is the most suburban in character of the five boroughs. Staten Island is connected to Brooklyn by the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, and to Manhattan by way of the free Staten Island Ferry, a daily commuter ferry which provides unobstructed views of the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, and Lower Manhattan. In central Staten Island, the Staten Island Greenbelt spans approximately 2,500 acres (10 km2), including 28 miles (45 km) of walking trails and one of the last undisturbed forests in the city.[185] Designated in 1984 to protect the island's natural lands, the Greenbelt comprises seven city parks.

New York has architecturally noteworthy buildings in a wide range of styles and from distinct time periods, from the Dutch Colonial Pieter Claesen Wyckoff House in Brooklyn, the oldest section of which dates to 1656, to the modern One World Trade Center, the skyscraper at Ground Zero in Lower Manhattan and the most expensive office tower in the world by construction cost.[187] Manhattan's skyline, with its many skyscrapers, is universally recognized, and the city has been home to several of the tallest buildings in the world. As of 2019[update], New York City had 6,455 high-rise buildings, the third most in the world after Hong Kong and Seoul.[188] Of these, as of 2011[update], 550 completed structures were at least 330 feet (100 m) high, with more than fifty completed skyscrapers taller than 656 feet (200 m). These include the Woolworth Building, an early example of Gothic Revival architecture in skyscraper design, built with massively scaled Gothic detailing; completed in 1913, for 17 years it was the world's tallest building.[189] The 1916 Zoning Resolution required setbacks in new buildings and restricted towers to a percentage of the lot size, to allow sunlight to reach the streets below.[190] The Art Deco style of the Chrysler Building (1930) and Empire State Building (1931), with their tapered tops and steel spires, reflected the zoning requirements. The buildings have distinctive ornamentation, such as the eagles at the corners of the 61st floor on the Chrysler Building, and are considered some of the finest examples of the Art Deco style.[191] A highly influential example of the international style in the United States is the Seagram Building (1957), distinctive for its façade using visible bronze-toned I-beams to evoke the building's structure. The Condé Nast Building (2000) is a prominent example of green design in American skyscrapers[192] and has received an award from the American Institute of Architects and AIA New York State for its design. The character of New York's large residential districts is often defined by the elegant brownstone rowhouses and townhouses and shabby tenements that were built during a period of rapid expansion from 1870 to 1930.[193] In contrast, New York City also has neighborhoods that are less densely populated and feature free-standing dwellings. In neighborhoods such as Riverdale (in the Bronx), Ditmas Park (in Brooklyn), and Douglaston (in Queens), large single-family homes are common in various architectural styles such as Tudor Revival and Victorian.[194][195][196] Stone and brick became the city's building materials of choice after the construction of wood-frame houses was limited in the aftermath of the Great Fire of 1835.[197] A distinctive feature of many of the city's buildings is the roof-mounted wooden water tower. In the 1800s, the city required their installation on buildings higher than six stories to prevent the need for excessively high water pressures at lower elevations, which could break municipal water pipes.[198] Garden apartments became popular during the 1920s in outlying areas, such as Jackson Heights.[199] According to the United States Geological Survey, an updated analysis of seismic hazard in July 2014 revealed a ""slightly lower hazard for tall buildings"" in New York City than previously assessed. Scientists estimated this lessened risk based upon a lower likelihood than previously thought of slow shaking near the city, which would be more likely to cause damage to taller structures from an earthquake in the vicinity of the city.[200] Climate Main article: Climate of New York City Queens–Midtown Tunnel after flooding caused by Superstorm Sandy on October 29, 2012 Under the Köppen climate classification, using the 0 °C (32 °F) isotherm, New York City features a humid subtropical climate (Cfa), and is thus the northernmost major city on the North American continent with this categorization. The suburbs to the immediate north and west lie in the transitional zone between humid subtropical and humid continental climates (Dfa).[201][202] By the Trewartha classification, the city is defined as having an oceanic climate (Do).[203][204] Annually, the city averages 234 days with at least some sunshine.[205] The city lies in the USDA 7b plant hardiness zone.[206] Central Park in Winter by Raymond Speers, in Munsey's Magazine, February 1900 Winters are chilly and damp, and prevailing wind patterns that blow sea breezes offshore temper the moderating effects of the Atlantic Ocean; yet the Atlantic and the partial shielding from colder air by the Appalachian Mountains keep the city warmer in the winter than inland North American cities at similar or lesser latitudes such as Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, and Indianapolis. The daily mean temperature in January, the area's coldest month, is 33.7 °F (0.9 °C).[207] Temperatures usually drop to 10 °F (−12 °C) several times per winter,[208] yet can also reach 60 °F (16 °C) for several days even in the coldest winter month. Spring and autumn are unpredictable and can range from cool to warm, although they are usually mild with low humidity. Summers are typically hot and humid, with a daily mean temperature of 77.5 °F (25.3 °C) in July.[207] Nighttime temperatures are often enhanced due to the urban heat island effect. Daytime temperatures exceed 90 °F (32 °C) on average of 17 days each summer and in some years exceed 100 °F (38 °C), although this is a rare achievement, last occurring on July 18, 2012.[209] Similarly, readings of 0 °F (−18 °C) are also extremely rare, last occurring on February 14, 2016.[210] Extreme temperatures have ranged from −15 °F (−26 °C), recorded on February 9, 1934, up to 106 °F (41 °C) on July 9, 1936;[207] the coldest recorded wind chill was −37 °F (−38 °C) on the same day as the all-time record low.[211] The record cold daily maximum was 2 °F (−17 °C) on December 30, 1917, while, conversely, the record warm daily minimum was 87 °F (31 °C), on July 2, 1903.[209] The average water temperature of the nearby Atlantic Ocean ranges from 39.7 °F (4.3 °C) in February to 74.1 °F (23.4 °C) in August.[212] The city receives 49.5 inches (1,260 mm) of precipitation annually, which is relatively evenly spread throughout the year. Average winter snowfall between 1981 and 2010 has been 29.8 inches (76 cm); this varies considerably between years. Hurricanes and tropical storms are rare in the New York area.[213] Hurricane Sandy brought a destructive storm surge to New York City on the evening of October 29, 2012, flooding numerous streets, tunnels, and subway lines in Lower Manhattan and other areas of the city and cutting off electricity in many parts of the city and its suburbs.[214] The storm and its profound impacts have prompted the discussion of constructing seawalls and other coastal barriers around the shorelines of the city and the metropolitan area to minimize the risk of destructive consequences from another such event in the future.[215][216] The coldest month on record is January 1857, with a mean temperature of 19.6 °F (−6.9 °C) whereas the warmest months on record are July 1825 and July 1999, both with a mean temperature of 81.4 °F (27.4 °C).[217] The warmest years on record are 2012 and 2020, both with mean temperatures of 57.1 °F (13.9 °C). The coldest year is 1836, with a mean temperature of 47.3 °F (8.5 °C).[217][218] The driest month on record is June 1949, with 0.02 inches (0.51 mm) of rainfall. The wettest month was August 2011, with 18.95 inches (481 mm) of rainfall. The driest year on record is 1965, with 26.09 inches (663 mm) of rainfall. The wettest year was 1983, with 80.56 inches (2,046 mm) of rainfall.[219] The snowiest month on record is February 2010, with 36.9 inches (94 cm) of snowfall. The snowiest season (Jul–Jun) on record is 1995–1996, with 75.6 inches (192 cm) of snowfall. The least snowy season was 1972–1973, with 2.3 inches (5.8 cm) of snowfall.[220] The earliest seasonal trace of snowfall occurred on October 10, in both 1979 and 1925. The latest seasonal trace of snowfall occurred on May 9, in both 2020 and 1977.[221] vteClimate data for New York (Belvedere Castle, Central Park), 1991–2020 normals,[a] extremes 1869–present[b] Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °F (°C) 72(22) 78(26) 86(30) 96(36) 99(37) 101(38) 106(41) 104(40) 102(39) 94(34) 84(29) 75(24) 106(41) Mean maximum °F (°C) 60.4(15.8) 60.7(15.9) 70.3(21.3) 82.9(28.3) 88.5(31.4) 92.1(33.4) 95.7(35.4) 93.4(34.1) 89.0(31.7) 79.7(26.5) 70.7(21.5) 62.9(17.2) 97.0(36.1) Average high °F (°C) 39.5(4.2) 42.2(5.7) 49.9(9.9) 61.8(16.6) 71.4(21.9) 79.7(26.5) 84.9(29.4) 83.3(28.5) 76.2(24.6) 64.5(18.1) 54.0(12.2) 44.3(6.8) 62.6(17.0) Daily mean °F (°C) 33.7(0.9) 35.9(2.2) 42.8(6.0) 53.7(12.1) 63.2(17.3) 72.0(22.2) 77.5(25.3) 76.1(24.5) 69.2(20.7) 57.9(14.4) 48.0(8.9) 39.1(3.9) 55.8(13.2) Average low °F (°C) 27.9(−2.3) 29.5(−1.4) 35.8(2.1) 45.5(7.5) 55.0(12.8) 64.4(18.0) 70.1(21.2) 68.9(20.5) 62.3(16.8) 51.4(10.8) 42.0(5.6) 33.8(1.0) 48.9(9.4) Mean minimum °F (°C) 9.8(−12.3) 12.7(−10.7) 19.7(−6.8) 32.8(0.4) 43.9(6.6) 52.7(11.5) 61.8(16.6) 60.3(15.7) 50.2(10.1) 38.4(3.6) 27.7(−2.4) 18.0(−7.8) 7.7(−13.5) Record low °F (°C) −6(−21) −15(−26) 3(−16) 12(−11) 32(0) 44(7) 52(11) 50(10) 39(4) 28(−2) 5(−15) −13(−25) −15(−26) Average precipitation inches (mm) 3.64(92) 3.19(81) 4.29(109) 4.09(104) 3.96(101) 4.54(115) 4.60(117) 4.56(116) 4.31(109) 4.38(111) 3.58(91) 4.38(111) 49.52(1,258) Average snowfall inches (cm) 8.8(22) 10.1(26) 5.0(13) 0.4(1.0) 0.0(0.0) 0.0(0.0) 0.0(0.0) 0.0(0.0) 0.0(0.0) 0.1(0.25) 0.5(1.3) 4.9(12) 29.8(76) Average precipitation days (≥ 0.01 in) 10.8 10.0 11.1 11.4 11.5 11.2 10.5 10.0 8.8 9.5 9.2 11.4 125.4 Average snowy days (≥ 0.1 in) 3.7 3.2 2.0 0.2 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.2 2.1 11.4 Average relative humidity (%) 61.5 60.2 58.5 55.3 62.7 65.2 64.2 66.0 67.8 65.6 64.6 64.1 63.0 Average dew point °F (°C) 18.0(−7.8) 19.0(−7.2) 25.9(−3.4) 34.0(1.1) 47.3(8.5) 57.4(14.1) 61.9(16.6) 62.1(16.7) 55.6(13.1) 44.1(6.7) 34.0(1.1) 24.6(−4.1) 40.3(4.6) Mean monthly sunshine hours 162.7 163.1 212.5 225.6 256.6 257.3 268.2 268.2 219.3 211.2 151.0 139.0 2,534.7 Percent possible sunshine 54 55 57 57 57 57 59 63 59 61 51 48 57 Average ultraviolet index 2 3 4 6 7 8 8 8 6 4 2 1 5 Source 1: NOAA (relative humidity and sun 1961–1990; dew point 1965–1984)[209][223][205][224] Source 2: Weather Atlas[225] See Climate of New York City for additional climate information from the outer boroughs.

Parks Flushing Meadows–Corona Park was used in both the 1939 and 1964 New York World's Fair, with the Unisphere as the centerpiece of the latter and which remains today. The city of New York has a complex park system, with various lands operated by the National Park Service, the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, and the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. In its 2018 ParkScore ranking, The Trust for Public Land reported that the park system in New York City was the ninth-best park system among the fifty most populous U.S. cities.[226] ParkScore ranks urban park systems by a formula that analyzes median park size, park acres as percent of city area, the percent of city residents within a half-mile of a park, spending of park services per resident, and the number of playgrounds per 10,000 residents. National parks Main article: National Park Service The Statue of Liberty on Liberty Island in New York Harbor is a symbol of the United States and its ideals of freedom, democracy, and opportunity.[227] Gateway National Recreation Area contains over 26,000 acres (110 km2) in total, most of it surrounded by New York City,[228] including the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge. In Brooklyn and Queens, the park contains over 9,000 acres (36 km2) of salt marsh, wetlands, islands, and water, including most of Jamaica Bay. Also in Queens, the park includes a significant portion of the western Rockaway Peninsula, most notably Jacob Riis Park and Fort Tilden. In Staten Island, Gateway National Recreation Area includes Fort Wadsworth, with historic pre-Civil War era Battery Weed and Fort Tompkins, and Great Kills Park, with beaches, trails, and a marina. The Statue of Liberty National Monument and Ellis Island Immigration Museum are managed by the National Park Service and are in both the states of New York and New Jersey. They are joined in the harbor by Governors Island National Monument, in New York. Historic sites under federal management on Manhattan Island include Castle Clinton National Monument; Federal Hall National Memorial; Theodore Roosevelt Birthplace National Historic Site; General Grant National Memorial (""Grant's Tomb""); African Burial Ground National Monument; and Hamilton Grange National Memorial. Hundreds of private properties are listed on the National Register of Historic Places or as a National Historic Landmark such as, for example, the Stonewall Inn, part of the Stonewall National Monument in Greenwich Village, as the catalyst of the modern gay rights movement.[134][135][136][137][138] State parks Main article: New York State Parks There are seven state parks within the confines of New York City, including Clay Pit Ponds State Park Preserve, a natural area that includes extensive riding trails, and Riverbank State Park, a 28-acre (11 ha) facility that rises 69 feet (21 m) over the Hudson River.[229] City parks See also: Parks and recreation in New York City View of The Pond and Midtown Manhattan from the Gapstow Bridge in Central Park, one of the world's most visited tourist attractions, in 2019 California sea lions play at the Bronx Zoo, the world's largest metropolitan zoo.[181] New York City has over 28,000 acres (110 km2) of municipal parkland and 14 miles (23 km) of public beaches.[230] The largest municipal park in the city is Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx, with 2,772 acres (1,122 ha).[184][231] Central Park, an 843-acre (3.41 km2)[184] park in middle-upper Manhattan, is the most visited urban park in the United States and one of the most filmed locations in the world, with 40 million visitors in 2013.[232] The park has a wide range of attractions; there are several lakes and ponds, two ice-skating rinks, the Central Park Zoo, the Central Park Conservatory Garden, and the 106-acre (0.43 km2) Jackie Onassis Reservoir.[233] Indoor attractions include Belvedere Castle with its nature center, the Swedish Cottage Marionette Theater, and the historic Carousel. On October 23, 2012, hedge fund manager John A. Paulson announced a $100 million gift to the Central Park Conservancy, the largest ever monetary donation to New York City's park system.[234] Washington Square Park is a prominent landmark in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Lower Manhattan. The Washington Square Arch at the northern gateway to the park is an iconic symbol of both New York University and Greenwich Village. Prospect Park in Brooklyn has a 90-acre (36 ha) meadow, a lake, and extensive woodlands. Within the park is the historic Battle Pass, prominent in the Battle of Long Island.[235] Flushing Meadows–Corona Park in Queens, with its 897 acres (363 ha) making it the city's fourth largest park,[236] was the setting for the 1939 World's Fair and the 1964 World's Fair[237] and is host to the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center and the annual U.S. Open Tennis Championships tournament.[238] Over a fifth of the Bronx's area, 7,000 acres (28 km2), is given over to open space and parks, including Pelham Bay Park, Van Cortlandt Park, the Bronx Zoo, and the New York Botanical Gardens.[239] In Staten Island, the Conference House Park contains the historic Conference House, site of the only attempt of a peaceful resolution to the American Revolution which was conducted in September 1775, attended by Benjamin Franklin representing the Americans and Lord Howe representing the British Crown.[240] The historic Burial Ridge, the largest Native American burial ground within New York City, is within the park.[241] Military installations Brooklyn is home to Fort Hamilton, the U.S. military's only active duty installation within New York City,[242] aside from Coast Guard operations. The facility was established in 1825 on the site of a small battery utilized during the American Revolution, and it is one of America's longest serving military forts.[243] Today Fort Hamilton serves as the headquarters of the North Atlantic Division of the United States Army Corps of Engineers and for the New York City Recruiting Battalion. It also houses the 1179th Transportation Brigade, the 722nd Aeromedical Staging Squadron, and a military entrance processing station. Other formerly active military reservations still utilized for National Guard and military training or reserve operations in the city include Fort Wadsworth in Staten Island and Fort Totten in Queens.

New York City gained more residents between April 2010 and July 2014 (316,000) than any other U.S. city.[256] New York City's population is about 43% of New York State's population,[259] and about 36% of the population of the New York metropolitan area.[260] Population density In 2017, the city had an estimated population density of 28,491 inhabitants per square mile (11,000/km2), rendering it the nation's most densely populated of all municipalities (of more than 100,000), with several small cities (of fewer than 100,000) in adjacent Hudson County, New Jersey having greater density, as per the 2010 census.[261] Geographically co-extensive with New York County, the borough of Manhattan's 2017 population density of 72,918 inhabitants per square mile (28,154/km2) makes it the highest of any county in the United States and higher than the density of any individual American city.[262][263][264][265] Race and ethnicity Further information: Category:Ethnic groups in New York City, Bangladeshis in New York City, Caribbeans in New York City, Chinese in New York City, Filipinos in New York City, Fuzhounese in New York City, Indians in New York City, Irish in New York City, Italians in New York City, Japanese in New York City, Koreans in New York City, Puerto Ricans in New York City, Russians in New York City, and Ukrainians in New York City A map of racial distribution in New York, 2010 U.S. Census. Each dot is 25 people: White, Black, Asian, Hispanic or Other (yellow). The city's population in 2010 was 44% White (33.3% non-Hispanic White), 25.5% Black or African American (23% non-Hispanic Black), 0.7% Native American or Alaska Native, and 12.7% Asian.[266] Hispanics or Latinos of any race represented 28.6% of the population,[266] while Asians constituted the fastest-growing segment of the city's population between 2000 and 2010; the non-Hispanic White population declined three percent, the smallest recorded decline in decades; and for the first time since the U.S. Civil War, the number of Black people declined over a decade.[267] Throughout its history, New York has been a major port of entry for immigrants into the United States. More than 12 million European immigrants were received at Ellis Island between 1892 and 1924.[268] The term ""melting pot"" was first coined to describe densely populated immigrant neighborhoods on the Lower East Side. By 1900, Germans constituted the largest immigrant group, followed by the Irish, Jews, and Italians.[269] In 1940, Whites represented 92% of the city's population.[246] Approximately 37% of the city's population is foreign born, and more than half of all children are born to mothers who are immigrants as of 2013.[270][271] In New York, no single country or region of origin dominates.[270] The ten largest sources of foreign-born individuals in the city as of 2011[update] were the Dominican Republic, China, Mexico, Guyana, Jamaica, Ecuador, Haiti, India, Russia, and Trinidad and Tobago,[272] while the Bangladeshi-born immigrant population has become one of the fastest growing in the city, counting over 74,000 by 2011.[24][273] Clockwise, from upper left: the Manhattan Chinatown; Lower Manhattan's Little Italy; Upper Manhattan's Spanish Harlem; Little India, Queens; Brooklyn's Little Russia; Midtown Manhattan's Koreatown Asian Americans in New York City, according to the 2010 census, number more than one million, greater than the combined totals of San Francisco and Los Angeles.[274] New York contains the highest total Asian population of any U.S. city proper.[275] The New York City borough of Queens is home to the state's largest Asian American population and the largest Andean (Colombian, Ecuadorian, Peruvian, and Bolivian) populations in the United States, and is also the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world.[178][179] The Chinese population constitutes the fastest-growing nationality in New York State; multiple satellites of the original Manhattan Chinatown, in Brooklyn, and around Flushing, Queens, are thriving as traditionally urban enclaves—while also expanding rapidly eastward into suburban Nassau County[276] on Long Island,[277] as the New York metropolitan region and New York State have become the top destinations for new Chinese immigrants, respectively, and large-scale Chinese immigration continues into New York City and surrounding areas,[278][279][280][281][282][283] with the largest metropolitan Chinese diaspora outside Asia,[24][284] including an estimated 812,410 individuals in 2015.[285] In 2012, 6.3% of New York City was of Chinese ethnicity, with nearly three-fourths living in either Queens or Brooklyn, geographically on Long Island.[286] A community numbering 20,000 Korean-Chinese (Chaoxianzu or Joseonjok) is centered in Flushing, Queens, while New York City is also home to the largest Tibetan population outside China, India, and Nepal, also centered in Queens.[287] Koreans made up 1.2% of the city's population, and Japanese 0.3%. Filipinos were the largest Southeast Asian ethnic group at 0.8%, followed by Vietnamese, who made up 0.2% of New York City's population in 2010. Indians are the largest South Asian group, comprising 2.4% of the city's population, with Bangladeshis and Pakistanis at 0.7% and 0.5%, respectively.[288] Queens is the preferred borough of settlement for Asian Indians, Koreans, Filipinos and Malaysians,[289][278] and other Southeast Asians;[290] while Brooklyn is receiving large numbers of both West Indian and Asian Indian immigrants. New York City has the largest European and non-Hispanic White population of any American city. At 2.7 million in 2012, New York's non-Hispanic White population is larger than the non-Hispanic White populations of Los Angeles (1.1 million), Chicago (865,000), and Houston (550,000) combined.[291] The non-Hispanic White population was 6.6 million in 1940.[292] The non-Hispanic White population has begun to increase since 2010.[293] The European diaspora residing in the city is very diverse. According to 2012 Census estimates, there were roughly 560,000 Italian Americans, 385,000 Irish Americans, 253,000 German Americans, 223,000 Russian Americans, 201,000 Polish Americans, and 137,000 English Americans. Additionally, Greek and French Americans numbered 65,000 each, with those of Hungarian descent estimated at 60,000 people. Ukrainian and Scottish Americans numbered 55,000 and 35,000, respectively. People identifying ancestry from Spain numbered 30,838 total in 2010.[294] People of Norwegian and Swedish descent both stood at about 20,000 each, while people of Czech, Lithuanian, Portuguese, Scotch-Irish, and Welsh descent all numbered between 12,000 and 14,000.[295] Arab Americans number over 160,000 in New York City,[296] with the highest concentration in Brooklyn. Central Asians, primarily Uzbek Americans, are a rapidly growing segment of the city's non-Hispanic White population, enumerating over 30,000, and including more than half of all Central Asian immigrants to the United States,[297] most settling in Queens or Brooklyn.

Some attribute the phenomenon to new tactics used by the NYPD,[447] including its use of CompStat and the broken windows theory.[448] Others cite the end of the crack epidemic and demographic changes,[449] including from immigration.[450] Another theory is that widespread exposure to lead pollution from automobile exhaust, which can lower intelligence and increase aggression levels, incited the initial crime wave in the mid-20th century, most acutely affecting heavily trafficked cities like New York. A strong correlation was found demonstrating that violent crime rates in New York and other big cities began to fall after lead was removed from American gasoline in the 1970s.[451] Another theory cited to explain New York City's falling homicide rate is the inverse correlation between the number of murders and the increasingly wet climate in the city.[452] Organized crime has long been associated with New York City, beginning with the Forty Thieves and the Roach Guards in the Five Points in the 1820s. The 20th century saw a rise in the Mafia, dominated by the Five Families, as well as in gangs, including the Black Spades.[453] The Mafia and gang presence has declined in the city in the 21st century.[454][455] Firefighting Main article: New York City Fire Department The Fire Department of New York (FDNY) is the largest municipal fire department in the United States. The Fire Department of New York (FDNY), provides fire protection, technical rescue, primary response to biological, chemical, and radioactive hazards, and emergency medical services for the five boroughs of New York City. The FDNY is the largest municipal fire department in the United States and the second largest in the world after the Tokyo Fire Department. The FDNY employs approximately 11,080 uniformed firefighters and more than 3,300 uniformed EMTs and paramedics. The FDNY's motto is New York's Bravest. The fire department faces multifaceted firefighting challenges in many ways unique to New York. In addition to responding to building types that range from wood-frame single family homes to high-rise structures, the FDNY also responds to fires that occur in the New York City Subway.[456] Secluded bridges and tunnels, as well as large parks and wooded areas that can give rise to brush fires, also present challenges. The FDNY headquarters is located at 9 MetroTech Center in Downtown Brooklyn,[457] and the FDNY Fire Academy is located on Randalls Island.[458] There are three Bureau of Fire Communications alarm offices which receive and dispatch alarms to appropriate units. One office, at 11 Metrotech Center in Brooklyn, houses Manhattan/Citywide, Brooklyn, and Staten Island Fire Communications; the Bronx and Queens offices are in separate buildings. Public library system The Stephen A. Schwarzman Headquarters Building of the New York Public Library, at 5th Avenue and 42nd Street The New York Public Library, which has the largest collection of any public library system in the United States, serves Manhattan, the Bronx, and Staten Island.[459] Queens is served by the Queens Borough Public Library, the nation's second largest public library system, while the Brooklyn Public Library serves Brooklyn.[459] Culture and contemporary life Further information: Culture of New York City, List of nightclubs in New York City, and List of people from New York CityNew York City has been described as the cultural capital of the world by New York's Baruch College.[460] A book containing a series of essays titled New York, Culture Capital of the World, 1940–1965 has also been published as showcased by the National Library of Australia.[461] In describing New York, author Tom Wolfe said, ""Culture just seems to be in the air, like part of the weather.""[462] Numerous major American cultural movements began in the city, such as the Harlem Renaissance, which established the African-American literary canon in the United States.[463][464] The city became the center of stand-up comedy in the early 20th century, jazz[465] in the 1940s, abstract expressionism in the 1950s, and the birthplace of hip hop in the 1970s.[466] The city's punk[467] and hardcore[468] scenes were influential in the 1970s and 1980s. New York has long had a flourishing scene for Jewish American literature. The city is the birthplace of many cultural movements, including the Harlem Renaissance in literature and visual art; abstract expressionism (also known as the New York School) in painting; and hip hop,[183] punk, salsa, freestyle, Tin Pan Alley, certain forms of jazz, and (along with Philadelphia) disco in music. New York City has been considered the dance capital of the world.[469][470] The city is also frequently the setting for novels, movies (see List of films set in New York City), and television programs. New York Fashion Week is one of the world's preeminent fashion events and is afforded extensive coverage by the media.[471][472] New York has also frequently been ranked the top fashion capital of the world on the annual list compiled by the Global Language Monitor.[473] Pace The fast-paced streets of New York City One of the most common traits attributed to New York City is its fast pace,[474] which spawned the term New York minute.[475] Journalist Walt Whitman characterized New York's streets as being traversed by ""hurrying, feverish, electric crowds"".[476] Arts New York City has more than 2,000 arts and cultural organizations and more than 500 art galleries.[477] The city government funds the arts with a larger annual budget than the National Endowment for the Arts.[477] Wealthy business magnates in the 19th century built a network of major cultural institutions, such as Carnegie Hall and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which have become internationally renowned. The advent of electric lighting led to elaborate theater productions, and in the 1880s, New York City theaters on Broadway and along 42nd Street began featuring a new stage form that became known as the Broadway musical. Strongly influenced by the city's immigrants, productions such as those of Harrigan and Hart, George M. Cohan, and others used song in narratives that often reflected themes of hope and ambition. New York City itself is the subject or background of many plays and musicals. Performing arts Main articles: Broadway theatre and Music of New York City Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts Broadway theatre is one of the premier forms of English-language theatre in the world, named after Broadway, the major thoroughfare that crosses Times Square,[478] also sometimes referred to as ""The Great White Way"".[479][480][481] Forty-one venues in Midtown Manhattan's Theatre District, each with at least 500 seats, are classified as Broadway theatres. According to The Broadway League, Broadway shows sold approximately $1.27 billion worth of tickets in the 2013–2014 season, an 11.4% increase from $1.139 billion in the 2012–2013 season. Attendance in 2013–2014 stood at 12.21 million, representing a 5.5% increase from the 2012–2013 season's 11.57 million.[482] Performance artists displaying diverse skills are ubiquitous on the streets of Manhattan. Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, anchoring Lincoln Square on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, is home to numerous influential arts organizations, including the Metropolitan Opera, New York City Opera, New York Philharmonic, and New York City Ballet, as well as the Vivian Beaumont Theater, the Juilliard School, Jazz at Lincoln Center, and Alice Tully Hall. The Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute is in Union Square, and Tisch School of the Arts is based at New York University, while Central Park SummerStage presents free music concerts in Central Park.[483] The Metropolitan Museum of Art, part of Museum Mile, is one of the largest museums in the world.[484] Visual arts Main article: List of museums and cultural institutions in New York City New York City is home to hundreds of cultural institutions and historic sites. Museum Mile is the name for a section of Fifth Avenue running from 82nd to 105th streets on the Upper East Side of Manhattan,[485] in an area sometimes called Upper Carnegie Hill.[486] The Mile, which contains one of the densest displays of culture in the world, is actually three blocks longer than one mile (1.6 km). Ten museums occupy the length of this section of Fifth Avenue.[487] The tenth museum, the Museum for African Art, joined the ensemble in 2009, although its museum at 110th Street, the first new museum constructed on the Mile since the Guggenheim in 1959,[488] opened in late 2012. In addition to other programming, the museums collaborate for the annual Museum Mile Festival, held each year in June, to promote the museums and increase visitation.[489] Many of the world's most lucrative art auctions are held in New York City.[490][491] Cuisine Main articles: Cuisine of New York City and List of restaurants in New York City Smorgasburg opened in 2011 as an open-air food market and is part of the Brooklyn Flea.[492] New York City's food culture includes an array of international cuisines influenced by the city's immigrant history. Central and Eastern European immigrants, especially Jewish immigrants from those regions, brought bagels, cheesecake, hot dogs, knishes, and delicatessens (or delis) to the city. Italian immigrants brought New York-style pizza and Italian cuisine into the city, while Jewish immigrants and Irish immigrants brought pastrami[493] and corned beef,[494] respectively. Chinese and other Asian restaurants, sandwich joints, trattorias, diners, and coffeehouses are ubiquitous throughout the city. Some 4,000 mobile food vendors licensed by the city, many immigrant-owned, have made Middle Eastern foods such as falafel and kebabs[495] examples of modern New York street food. The city is home to ""nearly one thousand of the finest and most diverse haute cuisine restaurants in the world"", according to Michelin.[496] The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene assigns letter grades to the city's restaurants based upon their inspection results.[497] As of 2019, there were 27,043 restaurants in the city, up from 24,865 in 2017.[498] The Queens Night Market in Flushing Meadows–Corona Park attracts more than ten thousand people nightly to sample food from more than 85 countries.[499] Parades Clockwise, from upper left: the annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, the world's largest parade;[500] the annual Halloween Parade in Greenwich Village; the annual Philippine Independence Day Parade; and the ticker-tape parade for the Apollo 11 astronauts New York City is well known for its street parades, which celebrate a broad array of themes, including holidays, nationalities, human rights, and major league sports team championship victories. The majority of parades are held in Manhattan. The primary orientation of the annual street parades is typically from north to south, marching along major avenues. The annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade is the world's largest parade,[500] beginning alongside Central Park and processing southward to the flagship Macy's Herald Square store;[501] the parade is viewed on telecasts worldwide and draws millions of spectators in person.[500] Other notable parades including the annual St. Patrick's Day Parade in March, the LGBT Pride March in June, the Greenwich Village Halloween Parade in October, and numerous parades commemorating the independence days of many nations. Ticker-tape parades celebrating championships won by sports teams as well as other heroic accomplishments march northward along the Canyon of Heroes on Broadway from Bowling Green to City Hall Park in Lower Manhattan. Accent and dialect Main articles: New York City English and New York accent The New York area is home to a distinctive regional speech pattern called the New York dialect, alternatively known as Brooklynese or New Yorkese. It has generally been considered one of the most recognizable accents within American English.[502] The traditional New York area accent is characterized as non-rhotic, so that the sound [ɹ] does not appear at the end of a syllable or immediately before a consonant; therefore the pronunciation of the city name as ""New Yawk.""[503] There is no [ɹ] in words like park [pɑək] or [pɒək] (with vowel backed and diphthongized due to the low-back chain shift), butter [bʌɾə], or here [hiə]. In another feature called the low back chain shift, the [ɔ] vowel sound of words like talk, law, cross, chocolate, and coffee and the often homophonous [ɔr] in core and more are tensed and usually raised more than in General American English. In the most old-fashioned and extreme versions of the New York dialect, the vowel sounds of words like ""girl"" and of words like ""oil"" became a diphthong [ɜɪ]. This is often misperceived by speakers of other accents as a reversal of the er and oy sounds, so that girl is pronounced ""goil"" and oil is pronounced ""erl""; this leads to the caricature of New Yorkers saying things like ""Joizey"" (Jersey), ""Toidy-Toid Street"" (33rd St.) and ""terlet"" (toilet).[503] The character Archie Bunker from the 1970s television sitcom All in the Family was an example of having used this pattern of speech. The classic version of the New York City dialect is generally centered on middle and working-class New Yorkers. The influx of non-European immigrants in recent decades has led to changes in this distinctive dialect,[503] and the traditional form of this speech pattern is no longer as prevalent among general New Yorkers as it has been in the past.[503] Sports The New York Marathon is the largest marathon in the world.[504]The U.S. Open Tennis Championships are held every August and September in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens.Citi Field, also in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, has been home to the New York Mets since 2009.Main article: Sports in the New York metropolitan area New York City is home to the headquarters of the National Football League,[505] Major League Baseball,[506] the National Basketball Association,[507] the National Hockey League,[508] and Major League Soccer.[509] The New York metropolitan area hosts the most sports teams in the four major North American professional sports leagues with nine, one more than Los Angeles, and has 11 top-level professional sports teams if Major League Soccer is included, also one more than Los Angeles. Participation in professional sports in the city predates all professional leagues, and the city has been continuously hosting professional sports since the birth of the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1882. The city has played host to more than forty major professional teams in the five sports and their respective competing league. Four of the ten most expensive stadiums ever built worldwide (MetLife Stadium, the new Yankee Stadium, Madison Square Garden, and Citi Field) are located in the New York metropolitan area.[510] Madison Square Garden, its predecessor, the original Yankee Stadium and Ebbets Field, are sporting venues located in New York City, the latter two having been commemorated on U.S. postage stamps. New York was the first of eight American cities to have won titles in all four major leagues (MLB, NHL, NFL and NBA), having done so following the Knicks' 1970 title. In 1972, it became the first city to win titles in five sports when the Cosmos won the NASL final. New York has been described as the ""Capital of Baseball"".[511] There have been 35 Major League Baseball World Series and 73 pennants won by New York teams. It is one of only five metro areas (Los Angeles, Chicago, Baltimore–Washington, and the San Francisco Bay Area being the others) to have two baseball teams. Additionally, there have been 14 World Series in which two New York City teams played each other, known as a Subway Series and occurring most recently in 2000. No other metropolitan area has had this happen more than once (Chicago in 1906, St. Louis in 1944, and the San Francisco Bay Area in 1989). The city's two Major League Baseball teams are the New York Mets, who play at Citi Field in Queens,[512] and the New York Yankees, who play at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx. These teams compete in six games of interleague play every regular season that has also come to be called the Subway Series. The Yankees have won a record 27 championships,[513] while the Mets have won the World Series twice.[514] The city also was once home to the Brooklyn Dodgers (now the Los Angeles Dodgers), who won the World Series once,[515] and the New York Giants (now the San Francisco Giants), who won the World Series five times. Both teams moved to California in 1958.[516] There are also two Minor League Baseball teams in the city, the Brooklyn Cyclones[517] and Staten Island Yankees.[518] The city is represented in the National Football League by the New York Giants and the New York Jets, although both teams play their home games at MetLife Stadium in nearby East Rutherford, New Jersey,[519] which hosted Super Bowl XLVIII in 2014.[520] The metropolitan area is home to three National Hockey League teams. The New York Rangers, the traditional representative of the city itself and one of the league's Original Six, play at Madison Square Garden in Manhattan. The New York Islanders, traditionally representing Nassau and Suffolk Counties of Long Island, play at Barclays Center in Brooklyn and are planning a return to Nassau County by way of a new arena just outside the border with Queens at Belmont Park. The New Jersey Devils play at Prudential Center in nearby Newark, New Jersey and traditionally represent the counties of neighboring New Jersey which are coextensive with the boundaries of the New York metropolitan area and media market. The city's National Basketball Association teams are the Brooklyn Nets, which played in and were named for New Jersey until 2012, and the New York Knicks, while the New York Liberty is the city's Women's National Basketball Association team. The first national college-level basketball championship, the National Invitation Tournament, was held in New York in 1938 and remains in the city.[521] The city is well known for its links to basketball, which is played in nearly every park in the city by local youth, many of whom have gone on to play for major college programs and in the NBA. In soccer, New York City is represented by New York City FC of Major League Soccer, who play their home games at Yankee Stadium[522] and the New York Red Bulls, who play their home games at Red Bull Arena in nearby Harrison, New Jersey.[523] Historically, the city is known for the New York Cosmos, the highly successful former professional soccer team which was the American home of Pelé. A new version of the New York Cosmos was formed in 2010, and began play in the second division North American Soccer League in 2013. The Cosmos play their home games at James M. Shuart Stadium on the campus of Hofstra University, just outside the New York City limits in Hempstead, New York. The annual United States Open Tennis Championships is one of the world's four Grand Slam tennis tournaments and is held at the National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens.[524] The New York City Marathon, which courses through all five boroughs, is the world's largest running marathon,[504] with 51,394 finishers in 2016[525] and 98,247 applicants for the 2017 race.[504] The Millrose Games is an annual track and field meet whose featured event is the Wanamaker Mile. Boxing is also a prominent part of the city's sporting scene, with events like the Amateur Boxing Golden Gloves being held at Madison Square Garden each year.[526] The city is also considered the host of the Belmont Stakes, the last, longest and oldest of horse racing's Triple Crown races, held just over the city's border at Belmont Park on the first or second Sunday of June. The city also hosted the 1932 U.S. Open golf tournament and the 1930 and 1939 PGA Championships, and has been host city for both events several times, most notably for nearby Winged Foot Golf Club. The Gaelic games are played in Riverdale, Bronx at Gaelic Park, home to the New York GAA, the only North American team to compete at the senior inter-county level. Environment Main article: Environmental issues in New York City As of 2012, the city had about 6,000 hybrid taxis (shown) in service, the largest number of any city in North America.[527] Environmental impact reduction New York City has focused on reducing its environmental impact and carbon footprint.[528] Mass transit use in New York City is the highest in the United States. Also, by 2010, the city had 3,715 hybrid taxis and other clean diesel vehicles, representing around 28% of New York's taxi fleet in service, the most of any city in North America.[529] New York City is the host of Climate Week NYC, the largest Climate Week to take place globally and regarded as major annual climate summit. New York's high rate of public transit use, more than 200,000 daily cyclists as of 2014[update],[530] and many pedestrian commuters make it the most energy-efficient major city in the United States.[531] Walk and bicycle modes of travel account for 21% of all modes for trips in the city; nationally the rate for metro regions is about 8%.[532] In both its 2011 and 2015 rankings, Walk Score named New York City the most walkable large city in the United States,[533][534][535] and in 2018, Stacker ranked New York the most walkable U.S. city.[536] Citibank sponsored the introduction of 10,000 public bicycles for the city's bike-share project in the summer of 2013.[537] New York City's numerical ""in-season cycling indicator"" of bicycling in the city had hit an all-time high of 437 when measured in 2014.[538] The city government was a petitioner in the landmark Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency Supreme Court case forcing the EPA to regulate greenhouse gases as pollutants. The city is a leader in the construction of energy-efficient green office buildings, including the Hearst Tower among others.[192] Mayor Bill de Blasio has committed to an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions between 2014 and 2050 to reduce the city's contributions to climate change, beginning with a comprehensive ""Green Buildings"" plan.[528] Water purity and availability Main articles: Food and water in New York City and New York City water supply system New York City is supplied with drinking water by the protected Catskill Mountains watershed.[539] As a result of the watershed's integrity and undisturbed natural water filtration system, New York is one of only four major cities in the United States the majority of whose drinking water is pure enough not to require purification by water treatment plants.[540] The city's municipal water system is the largest in the United States, moving over one billion gallons of water per day.[541] The Croton Watershed north of the city is undergoing construction of a $3.2 billion water purification plant to augment New York City's water supply by an estimated 290 million gallons daily, representing a greater than 20% addition to the city's current availability of water.[542] The ongoing expansion of New York City Water Tunnel No. 3, an integral part of the New York City water supply system, is the largest capital construction project in the city's history,[543] with segments serving Manhattan and the Bronx completed, and with segments serving Brooklyn and Queens planned for construction in 2020.[544] In 2018, New York City announced a $1 billion investment to protect the integrity of its water system and to maintain the purity of its unfiltered water supply.[541] Air quality According to the 2016 World Health Organization Global Urban Ambient Air Pollution Database,[545] the annual average concentration in New York City's air of particulate matter measuring 2.5 micrometers or less (PM2.5) was 7.0 micrograms per cubic meter, or 3.0 micrograms below the recommended limit of the WHO Air Quality Guidelines for the annual mean PM2.5.[546] The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, in partnership with Queens College, conducts the New York Community Air Survey to measure pollutants at about 150 locations.[547] Environmental revitalization Newtown Creek, a 3.5-mile (6-kilometer) a long estuary that forms part of the border between the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens, has been designated a Superfund site for environmental clean-up and remediation of the waterway's recreational and economic resources for many communities.[548] One of the most heavily used bodies of water in the Port of New York and New Jersey, it had been one of the most contaminated industrial sites in the country,[549] containing years of discarded toxins, an estimated 30 million US gallons (110,000 m3) of spilled oil, including the Greenpoint oil spill, raw sewage from New York City's sewer system,[549] and other accumulation. Government and politics Main articles: Government of New York City and Politics of New York City Government New York City Hall is the oldest City Hall in the United States that still houses its original governmental functions. New York City has been a metropolitan municipality with a Strong mayor–council form of government[550] since its consolidation in 1898. In New York City, the city government is responsible for public education, correctional institutions, public safety, recreational facilities, sanitation, water supply, and welfare services. The mayor and council members are elected to four-year terms. The City Council is a unicameral body consisting of 51 council members whose districts are defined by geographic population boundaries.[551] Each term for the mayor and council members lasts four years and has a two consecutive-term limit,[552] which is reset after a four-year break. The New York City Administrative Code, the New York City Rules, and the City Record are the code of local laws, compilation of regulations, and official journal, respectively.[553][554] The New York County Courthouse houses the New York Supreme Court and other offices. Each borough is coextensive with a judicial district of the state Unified Court System, of which the Criminal Court and the Civil Court are the local courts, while the New York Supreme Court conducts major trials and appeals. Manhattan hosts the First Department of the Supreme Court, Appellate Division while Brooklyn hosts the Second Department. There are also several extrajudicial administrative courts, which are executive agencies and not part of the state Unified Court System. Uniquely among major American cities, New York is divided between, and is host to the main branches of, two different U.S. district courts: the District Court for the Southern District of New York, whose main courthouse is on Foley Square near City Hall in Manhattan and whose jurisdiction includes Manhattan and the Bronx; and the District Court for the Eastern District of New York, whose main courthouse is in Brooklyn and whose jurisdiction includes Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and U.S. Court of International Trade are also based in New York, also on Foley Square in Manhattan. Politics Bill de Blasio, the current and 109th Mayor of New York City The present mayor is Bill de Blasio, the first Democrat since 1993.[555] He was elected in 2013 with over 73% of the vote, and assumed office on January 1, 2014. The Democratic Party holds the majority of public offices. As of April 2016, 69% of registered voters in the city are Democrats and 10% are Republicans.[556] New York City has not been carried by a Republican in a statewide or presidential election since President Calvin Coolidge won the five boroughs in 1924. In 2012, Democrat Barack Obama became the first presidential candidate of any party to receive more than 80% of the overall vote in New York City, sweeping all five boroughs. Party platforms center on affordable housing, education, and economic development, and labor politics are of importance in the city. Thirteen out of 27 U.S. congressional districts in the State of New York include portions of New York City.[557] New York is one of the most important sources of political fundraising in the United States. At least four of the top five ZIP Codes in the nation for political contributions were in Manhattan for the 2004, 2006, and 2008 elections. The top ZIP Code, 10021 on the Upper East Side, generated the most money for the 2004 presidential campaigns of George W. Bush and John Kerry.[558] The city has a strong imbalance of payments with the national and state governments. It receives 83 cents in services for every $1 it sends to the federal government in taxes (or annually sends $11.4 billion more than it receives back). City residents and businesses also sent an additional $4.1 billion in the 2009–2010 fiscal year to the state of New York than the city received in return.[559] Transportation Main article: Transportation in New York City New York City is home to the two busiest train stations in the U.S., including Grand Central Terminal. New York City's comprehensive transportation system is both complex and extensive. Rapid transit Mass transit in New York City, most of which runs 24 hours a day, accounts for one in every three users of mass transit in the United States, and two-thirds of the nation's rail riders live in the New York City metropolitan area.[560][561] Rail The iconic New York City Subway system is the largest rapid transit system in the world when measured by stations in operation, with 472, and by length of routes. Nearly all of New York's subway system is open 24 hours a day, in contrast to the overnight shutdown common to systems in most cities, including Hong Kong,[562][563] London, Paris, Seoul,[564][565] and Tokyo. The New York City Subway is also the busiest metropolitan rail transit system in the Western Hemisphere, with 1.76 billion passenger rides in 2015,[566] while Grand Central Terminal, also referred to as ""Grand Central Station"", is the world's largest railway station by number of train platforms. The New York City Subway is the world's largest rapid transit system by number of stations. Public transport is essential in New York City. 54.6% of New Yorkers commuted to work in 2005 using mass transit.[567] This is in contrast to the rest of the United States, where 91% of commuters travel in automobiles to their workplace.[568] According to the New York City Comptroller, workers in the New York City area spend an average of 6 hours and 18 minutes getting to work each week, the longest commute time in the nation among large cities.[569] New York is the only U.S. city in which a majority (52%) of households do not have a car; only 22% of Manhattanites own a car.[570] Due to their high usage of mass transit, New Yorkers spend less of their household income on transportation than the national average, saving $19 billion annually on transportation compared to other urban Americans.[571] New York City's commuter rail network is the largest in North America.[560] The rail network, connecting New York City to its suburbs, consists of the Long Island Rail Road, Metro-North Railroad, and New Jersey Transit. The combined systems converge at Grand Central Terminal and Pennsylvania Station and contain more than 250 stations and 20 rail lines.[560] In Queens, the elevated AirTrain people mover system connects 24 hours a day JFK International Airport to the New York City Subway and the Long Island Rail Road; a separate AirTrain system is planned alongside the Grand Central Parkway to connect LaGuardia Airport to these transit systems.[572][573] For intercity rail, New York City is served by Amtrak, whose busiest station by a significant margin is Pennsylvania Station on the West Side of Manhattan, from which Amtrak provides connections to Boston, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. along the Northeast Corridor, and long-distance train service to other North American cities.[574] The Staten Island Railway rapid transit system solely serves Staten Island, operating 24 hours a day. The Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH train) links Midtown and Lower Manhattan to northeastern New Jersey, primarily Hoboken, Jersey City, and Newark. Like the New York City Subway, the PATH operates 24 hours a day; meaning three of the six rapid transit systems in the world which operate on 24-hour schedules are wholly or partly in New York (the others are a portion of the Chicago 'L', the PATCO Speedline serving Philadelphia, and the Copenhagen Metro). Multibillion-dollar heavy rail transit projects under construction in New York City include the Second Avenue Subway, and the East Side Access project.[575] Buses The Port Authority Bus Terminal, the world's busiest bus station, at 8th Avenue and 42nd Street[576] New York City's public bus fleet runs 24/7 and is the largest in North America.[577] The Port Authority Bus Terminal, the main intercity bus terminal of the city, serves 7,000 buses and 200,000 commuters daily, making it the busiest bus station in the world.[576] Air New York's airspace is the busiest in the United States and one of the world's busiest air transportation corridors. The three busiest airports in the New York metropolitan area include John F. Kennedy International Airport, Newark Liberty International Airport, and LaGuardia Airport; 130.5 million travelers used these three airports in 2016, and the city's airspace is the busiest in the nation.[578] JFK and Newark Liberty were the busiest and fourth busiest U.S. gateways for international air passengers, respectively, in 2012; as of 2011[update], JFK was the busiest airport for international passengers in North America.[579] John F. Kennedy Airport in Queens, the busiest international air passenger gateway to the United States Plans have advanced to expand passenger volume at a fourth airport, Stewart International Airport near Newburgh, New York, by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.[580] Plans were announced in July 2015 to entirely rebuild LaGuardia Airport in a multibillion-dollar project to replace its aging facilities.[581] Other commercial airports in or serving the New York metropolitan area include Long Island MacArthur Airport, Trenton–Mercer Airport and Westchester County Airport. The primary general aviation airport serving the area is Teterboro Airport. Ferries The Staten Island Ferry shuttles commuters between Manhattan and Staten Island. The Staten Island Ferry is the world's busiest ferry route, carrying more than 23 million passengers from July 2015 through June 2016 on the 5.2-mile (8.4 km) route between Staten Island and Lower Manhattan and running 24 hours a day.[582] Other ferry systems shuttle commuters between Manhattan and other locales within the city and the metropolitan area. NYC Ferry, a NYCEDC initiative with routes planned to travel to all five boroughs, was launched in 2017, with second graders choosing the names of the ferries.[583] Meanwhile, Seastreak ferry announced construction of a 600-passenger high-speed luxury ferry in September 2016, to shuttle riders between the Jersey Shore and Manhattan, anticipated to start service in 2017; this would be the largest vessel in its class.[584] Taxis, vehicles for hire, and trams See also: Taxicabs of New York City Yellow medallion taxicabs are widely recognized icons of the city Other features of the city's transportation infrastructure encompass 13,587 yellow taxicabs;[585] other vehicle for hire companies;[586][587] and the Roosevelt Island Tramway, an aerial tramway that transports commuters between Roosevelt Island and Manhattan Island. Streets and highways 8th Avenue, looking northward (""uptown""). Most streets and avenues in Manhattan's grid plan incorporate a one-way traffic configuration. Despite New York's heavy reliance on its vast public transit system, streets are a defining feature of the city. The Commissioners' Plan of 1811 greatly influenced the city's physical development. Several of the city's streets and avenues, including Broadway,[588] Wall Street,[589] Madison Avenue,[351] and Seventh Avenue are also used as metonyms for national industries there: the theater, finance, advertising, and fashion organizations, respectively. New York City also has an extensive web of freeways and parkways, which link the city's boroughs to each other and to North Jersey, Westchester County, Long Island, and southwestern Connecticut through various bridges and tunnels. Because these highways serve millions of outer borough and suburban residents who commute into Manhattan, it is quite common for motorists to be stranded for hours in traffic congestion that are a daily occurrence, particularly during rush hour.[590][591] Congestion pricing in New York City will go into effect in 2022 at the earliest.[592][593][594] New York City is also known for its rules regarding turning at red lights. Unlike the rest of the United States, New York State prohibits right or left turns on red in cities with a population greater than one million, to reduce traffic collisions and increase pedestrian safety. In New York City, therefore, all turns at red lights are illegal unless a sign permitting such maneuvers is present.[595] River crossings The George Washington Bridge, connecting Upper Manhattan (background) from Fort Lee, New Jersey across the Hudson River, is the world's busiest motor vehicle bridge.[596][597] New York City is located on one of the world's largest natural harbors,[598] and the boroughs of Manhattan and Staten Island are primarily coterminous with islands of the same names, while Queens and Brooklyn are located at the west end of the larger Long Island, and the Bronx is located on New York State's mainland. This situation of boroughs separated by water led to the development of an extensive infrastructure of bridges and tunnels. The George Washington Bridge is the world's busiest motor vehicle bridge,[596][597] connecting Manhattan to Bergen County, New Jersey. The Verrazano-Narrows Bridge is the longest suspension bridge in the Americas and one of the world's longest.[599][600] The Brooklyn Bridge is an icon of the city itself. The towers of the Brooklyn Bridge are built of limestone, granite, and Rosendale cement, and their architectural style is neo-Gothic, with characteristic pointed arches above the passageways through the stone towers. This bridge was also the longest suspension bridge in the world from its opening until 1903, and is the first steel-wire suspension bridge. The Queensboro Bridge is an important piece of cantilever architecture. The Manhattan Bridge, opened in 1909, is considered to be the forerunner of modern suspension bridges, and its design served as the model for many of the long-span suspension bridges around the world; the Manhattan Bridge, Throgs Neck Bridge, Triborough Bridge, and Verrazano-Narrows Bridge are all examples of Structural Expressionism.[601][602] Manhattan Island is linked to New York City's outer boroughs and New Jersey by several tunnels as well. The Lincoln Tunnel, which carries 120,000 vehicles a day under the Hudson River between New Jersey and Midtown Manhattan, is the busiest vehicular tunnel in the world.[603] The tunnel was built instead of a bridge to allow unfettered passage of large passenger and cargo ships that sailed through New York Harbor and up the Hudson River to Manhattan's piers. The Holland Tunnel, connecting Lower Manhattan to Jersey City, New Jersey, was the world's first mechanically ventilated vehicular tunnel when it opened in 1927.[604][605] The Queens-Midtown Tunnel, built to relieve congestion on the bridges connecting Manhattan with Queens and Brooklyn, was the largest non-federal project in its time when it was completed in 1940.[606] President Franklin D. Roosevelt was the first person to drive through it.[607] The Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel (officially known as the Hugh L. Carey Tunnel) runs underneath Battery Park and connects the Financial District at the southern tip of Manhattan to Red Hook in Brooklyn. Cycling network Main article: Cycling in New York City Cycling in New York City is associated with mixed cycling conditions that include urban density, relatively flat terrain, congested roadways with ""stop-and-go"" traffic, and many pedestrians. The city's large cycling population includes utility cyclists, such as delivery and messenger services; cycling clubs for recreational cyclists; and increasingly commuters.[608] Cycling is increasingly popular in New York City; in 2017 there were approximately 450,000 daily bike trips, compared with 170,000 daily bike trips in 2005.[609] As of 2017[update], New York City had 1,333 miles (2,145 km) of bike lanes, compared to 513 miles (826 km) of bike lanes in 2006.[610] As of 2019, there are 126 miles (203 km) of segregated or ""protected"" bike lanes citywide.[611] “NO MOTOR VEHICLES E-BIKES E-SCOOTERS” Sign posted on the Hudson River Greenway in New York City New York City has taken actions to restrict the usage of e-bikes. Notable people Main article: List of people from New York City Global outreach Main article: List of sister cities of New York City In 2006, the Sister City Program of the City of New York, Inc. was restructured and renamed New York City Global Partners. Through this program, New York City has expanded its international outreach to a network of cities worldwide, promoting the exchange of ideas and innovation between their citizenry and policymakers. New York's historic sister cities are denoted below by the year they joined New York City's partnership network.[612] New York City Global Partners network Africa Accra, Ghana Addis Ababa, Ethiopia Cairo, Egypt (1982) Cape Town, South Africa Lagos, Nigeria Libreville, Gabon Johannesburg, South Africa (2003) Nairobi, Kenya Asia (East) Bangkok, Thailand Beijing, China (1980) Biên Hòa, Vietnam Changwon, South Korea Chongqing, China[613] Guangzhou, China Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam Hong Kong, China Jakarta, Indonesia Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia[614] Manila, Philippines Seoul, South Korea Shanghai, China Shenyang, China Singapore, Singapore Taipei, Taiwan Tokyo, Japan (1960) (South) Bangalore, India Delhi, India Dhaka, Bangladesh Karachi, Pakistan Mumbai, India (West) Dubai, United Arab Emirates Istanbul, Turkey (transcontinental) Jerusalem, Israel (1993) Tel Aviv, Israel[615] Australia Melbourne, Australia Sydney Europe (Central) Berlin, Germany Budapest, Hungary (1992) Düsseldorf, Germany Geneva, Switzerland Hamburg, Germany Heidelberg, Germany Munich, Germany Prague, Czech Republic Vienna, Austria Warsaw, Poland (East) Kyiv, Ukraine Moscow, Russia St. Petersburg, Russia (North) Copenhagen, Denmark Helsinki, Finland Oslo, Norway Stockholm, Sweden (South) Barcelona, Spain Bucharest, Romania Istanbul, Turkey (transcontinental) Lisbon, Portugal Madrid, Spain (1982) Milan, Italy Pristina, Kosovo Rome, Italy (1992) (West) Amsterdam, Netherlands Antwerp, Belgium Belfast, United Kingdom Brussels, Belgium Dublin, Ireland Edinburgh, United Kingdom Glasgow, United Kingdom London, United Kingdom (2001) Luxembourg City, Luxembourg Lyon, France Paris, France Rotterdam, Netherlands The Hague, Netherlands North America (Canada) Calgary, Alberta, Canada Edmonton, Alberta, Canada Montreal, Quebec, Canada Ottawa, Ontario, Canada Quebec City, Quebec, Canada Toronto, Ontario, Canada Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada Victoria, British Columbia, Canada Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada (Mexico, Central America, and Caribbean) Cuernavaca, Morales, Mexico Mexico City, Distrito Federal, Mexico Monterrey, Nuevo León, Mexico Panama City, Panama Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic (1983) (United States) Baltimore, Maryland, United States Boston, Massachusetts, United States Chicago, Illinois, United States Los Angeles, California, United States Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States South America Bogotá, Colombia Brasilia, Brazil (2004) Buenos Aires, Argentina Caracas, Venezuela Córdoba, Argentina Curitiba, Brazil Lima, Peru Medellín, Colombia Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Santiago, Chile São Paulo, Brazil See also Outline of New York City Notes ^ Mean monthly maxima and minima (i.e. the expected highest and lowest temperature readings at any point during the year or given month) calculated based on data at said location from 1991 to 2020. ^ Official weather observations for Central Park were conducted at the Arsenal at Fifth Avenue and 64th Street from 1869 to 1919, and at Belvedere Castle since 1919.[222] References ^ ""US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990"".

Its certificate seal gives information to consumers about business practices, based on certain standards they set.[1] They are a product-oriented multistakeholder governance group combining the interests of companies, farmers, foresters, communities, and consumers to produce sustainable and harmonious goods and services.[2] Contents 1 Merger with UTZ 2 Rainforest Alliance programs 2.1 Sustainable forestry certification 2.2 Sustainable agriculture certification 2.2.1 Crop standards and criteria 2.2.2 Rainforest Alliance Certified Seal 2.3 Sustainable tourism 3 Rainforest Alliance 2020 Certification Program 4 Criticism and response 4.1 Minimum price issues 4.2 Use of seal 4.3 Lawsuit filed against Rainforest Alliance 4.4 Costa Rican pineapples 4.5 Latin American Banana Growers 4.5.1 Issues 4.5.2 Reaction of the banana industry 5 See also 6 References 7 External links Merger with UTZ[edit] In June 2017, the Rainforest Alliance and UTZ announced the intention to merge,[3] and in January 2018 the merger was legally closed and completed. The organizations merged in recognition of their similar work to address deforestation, climate change, systemic poverty, and social inequity. The merged organization, going by the name the Rainforest Alliance, points to the increased size and strength of their combined expertise to achieve a scale of impact necessary to meet these challenges effectively.[4] The Rainforest Alliance's work continues in Latin America, Africa, and South and Southeast Asia. The new Rainforest Alliance plans to release a new certification standard in 2019, building upon the existing Rainforest Alliance Sustainable Agriculture Standard and the UTZ Certification Standard. Releasing one standard will help the 182,000 cocoa, coffee, and tea farmers currently certified under both standards, avoiding a double administrative load of working with two standards and certification systems.[5] The UTZ and Rainforest Alliance certification programs are running separately and in parallel until the publication of the new program in 2020.[6] Rainforest Alliance programs[edit] A woman picks coffee on the slopes of the Rainforest Alliance Certified cooperative Ciudad Barrios in El Salvador. Sustainable forestry certification[edit] The Rainforest Alliance launched the world’s first sustainable forestry certification program in 1989 to encourage market-driven and environmentally and socially responsible management of forests, tree farms, and forest resources. As of October 1, 2018, the Rainforest Alliance transitioned its certification business, including all related services, personnel and clients, to Nature Economy and People Connected (NEPCon), a non-profit organization based in Copenhagen, Denmark, with a global network. NEPCon has been a member of the FSC since 1996. Sustainable agriculture certification[edit] The Rainforest Alliance's sustainable agriculture program includes training programs for farmers and the certification of small, medium and large farms that produce more than 100 different crops, including avocado, cattle, cinnamon, coffee, palm oil, and potatoes, as well as tea, cocoa, and bananas. In recent years, the Rainforest Alliance has greatly expanded its work with smallholders, who now account for 75% of the farms (more than 783,000 farmers in all) certified by the organization. To obtain certification, farms must meet the Sustainable Agriculture Standard, which is designed to conserve ecosystems, protect biodiversity and waterways, conserve forests, reduce agrochemical use, and safeguard the well-being of workers and local communities. The Rainforest Alliance encourages businesses and consumers to support sustainable agriculture by sourcing or choosing products grown on certified farms. More than 7 million hectares of farmland—are being managed sustainably under Rainforest Alliance certification, as of 2018.[7] Crop standards and criteria[edit] The organization requires that 50% of criteria under a certain principle (group of criteria) be achieved, and 80% overall.[8] Several of these criteria are ""critical"" and must be complied with for a farm to earn certification. They include an ecosystem conservation program, protection of wild animals and waterways, the prohibition of discrimination in work and hiring practices, the prohibition of contracting children under the age of 15, the use of protective gear for workers, guidelines about agrochemical use and the prohibition of transgenic crops.[8] Rainforest Alliance Certified Seal[edit] The Rainforest Alliance Certified seal appears only on products that meet the crop standards and criteria detailed above. According to Consumer Reports, ""The Rainforest Alliance Certified label is clear and meaningful in support of sustainable agriculture, social responsibility and integrated pest management. The label is consistent in meaning among all certified. The label does not consist of farmers and none of the members are certified by the Rainforest Alliance. In this sense, the organizations behind these labels are independent from the products they certify.""[9] In February 2008, Ethical Corporation called Rainforest Alliance certification a ""rigorous, independently verified scheme"".[10] As of 2015[update], more than 4,300 companies buy or sell products from Rainforest Alliance Certified farms, and the Rainforest Alliance Certified seal can be seen in more than 120 countries. As of June 2015[update], 13.6 percent of the world’s cocoa and 15.1 percent of tea comes from Rainforest Alliance Certified farms.[11] As of 2017[update], 5.7 percent of the world's coffee comes from Rainforest Alliance Certified farms.[12] Sustainable tourism[edit] The Rainforest Alliance was a pioneer in third-party sustainable tourism recognition, working with hotels, inbound and outbound tour operators, and other tourism businesses to help them improve their environmental, social, and economic practices. As of October 1, 2018, NEPCon assumed management of the Rainforest Alliance Sustainable Tourism Standards for Hotel and Lodging Services and Inbound Tour Operators. These standards include all elements of the Global Sustainable Tourism Council (GSTC) Criteria for Hotels and Tour Operators. Rainforest Alliance 2020 Certification Program[edit] Rainforest Alliance (RFA) certification has been extended in recent years to products such as pineapples, coffee, cocoa, bananas, tea and palm oil, among others.[13] The presence of the seal in these products has become an added value in the commercial arena. Especially for retail groups, the seal represents a differential that distinguishes and certifies that the crop in question has been produced in a sustainable way, meeting specific requirements.[14] Voluntary certification schemes as this one aim at rewarding those producers and farmers who make the effort of putting into place better agricultural practices so as to obtain the certification.[15] However, in practice the producers are not always retributed for their efforts.[16] In order to obtain the Rainforest Alliance seal, compliance with certain environmental criteria is required. Like this, farms that want to qualify for certification are regularly audited in order to check compliance.[17] These requirements are included in the organization's Certification Program. In June 2020, the certifier updated this Program, presenting its New Sustainability Standards.[18] The new program includes new features with respect to the previous one, asking for more demanding requirements in environmental and social terms. In addition, the Standard is composed of two main elements: a document listing the Farm Requirements,[19] and another one containing the Supply Chain Requirements.[20] The new Rainforest Alliance standard features innovation in nine areas: climate-smart agriculture, deforestation, conserving biodiversity, assessments, shared responsibility, human rights, living wage, continuous improvement, living income, risk-based assurance and gender equality.[21] Criticism and response[edit] Minimum price issues[edit] Rainforest Alliance sustainable agriculture certification, like the certification schemes UTZ Certified and organic,[22] does not offer producers minimum or guaranteed price,[16] therefore leaving them vulnerable to market price variations. For example, in the 1980s, a pound of standard-grade coffee sold for around US $1.20; in 2003, however, a pound sold for about $0.50, which was not enough to cover the costs of production in much of the world.[23] The price of coffee has since rebounded somewhat, with prices for arabica reaching $1.18/pound by the end of 2007.[24] Although many Rainforest Alliance Certified farms do in fact achieve price premiums for high-quality produce, Rainforest Alliance focuses on improving the entire spectrum of farming practices. Third-party studies have shown the organization’s approach to be effective in raising both income and net revenue for farmers.[25] Michigan State University professor of sociology Daniel Jaffee has criticized Rainforest Alliance certification, claiming that its standards are ""arguably far lower than fair trade's [sic]"" and saying ""they establish minimum housing and sanitary conditions but do not stipulate a minimum price for coffee. Critically, they require plantation owners only to pay laborers the national minimum wage, a notoriously inadequate standard.""[26] The Economist favors the Rainforest Alliance's method and notes that ""guaranteeing a minimum price [as Fairtrade does] means there is no incentive to improve quality."" They also note that coffee drinkers say ""the quality of Fairtrade brews varies widely. The Rainforest Alliance does things differently. It does not guarantee a minimum price or offer a premium but provides training advice. That consumers are often willing to pay more for a product with the [Rainforest Alliance] logo on it is an added bonus, not the result of a formal subsidy scheme; such products must still fend for themselves in the marketplace.""[27] Use of seal[edit] The organization certification has been criticized for allowing the use of the seal on products containing a minimum of 30% of certified content.[28] According to Michael Conroy, former chairman of the board for Fair Trade USA,[29] this use of the seal is the ""most damaging dimension"" of Rainforest Alliance's agricultural certification program and ""a serious blow to the integrity of certification"". Lawsuit filed against Rainforest Alliance[edit] An article in The Guardian reported that the US nonprofit Water and Sanitation Health (WASH) filed a lawsuit against Rainforest Alliance in 2014 alleging that Rainforest Alliance was responsible for unfair marketing because it certified Chiquita banana suppliers as sustainable when they were ""contaminating drinking water with fertilizers and fungicides and have air-dropped pesticides perilously close to schools and homes"" in Guatemala, raising the issue that Rainforest Alliance was facilitating greenwashing by companies making environmental claims. In the same article Rainforest Alliance called WASH’s allegations untrue and said it stands by its auditing practices and also objected to the lawsuit’s charges that the alliance sells its endorsement.[30][31][32] The nonprofit Truth in Advertising also reported that WASH was suing Rainforest Alliance for allegedly misrepresenting how earth-friendly its certified products actually are.[33] Costa Rican pineapples[edit] A report in 2020 by The Guardian alleged that some Costa Rica pineapple growers certified by the scheme were exploiting their labour force, using illegal agrochemicals, and concealing hundreds of undocumented workers from auditors. The Rainforest Alliance said all its certified plantations were required to comply with strict audits and inspections; but the report quoted the president of Fecon, a Costa Rican environmental group, as saying that audits were insufficiently rigorous to reveal violations.[34] Latin American Banana Growers[edit] Issues[edit] The publication of the new Rainforest Alliance standard has caused concern in the banana sector of several countries, especially due to the circumstances in which it has been published: the context of the coronavirus pandemic, which has had a worldwide impact. In particular, the reaction facing the new standard has been remarkable in Latin America. Several Latin American producer and exporter associations, who normally work together with the Rainforest Alliance certifier and share its ambitions and sustainable objectives aiming at reducing the climate footprint, have challenged its new standards.[35] They consider that the process that has led to the creation of these new standards counts with three major flaws: (1) the application of the standard will increase production costs, (2) it will also leave small farmers, who don't count with the economic means to make this extraordinary investment, out of the possibility to obtain the certification, losing therefore access to the European market, where this certification is key for trade purposes, and (3) the unilateral nature of the socialization process that has excluded most of the comments from the banana sector. These banana groups have been particularly concerned about the updates in the areas of production costs, living wages and other social components, agrochemical management and air application guidelines, and finally, shared responsibility. For these farmers, obtaining Rainforest Alliance certification is essential to keep the doors to the European Union market open, where more than 65% of their banana exports are directed.[36] But the arrival of the new requirements has called into question Rainforest Alliance's leadership and its management of the standard's socialization process. In addition, Rainforest Alliance certification adds up to other schemes such as Fair Trade International, EU Organic or Organic, which represent most of the private certifications that exist in the market. There are around 400 seals of this style, which stand out for their voluntary nature, with regulations related to the environmental, social, ethical and food safety areas.[15] In 2010, the European Commission published a communication in which it presented guidelines to good practices aimed at those private certification schemes for agricultural and food products.[37] The Commission's text tries to clarify the existing legal framework that covers voluntary certification processes, in order to increase their transparency and effectiveness, while ensuring that it does not conflict with national legal frameworks. These good practices proposed by the Commission set forth a series of tips for certification schemes, such as the need to reduce the administrative burden on producers, the requirement for clarity and transparency regarding their social, economic, legal and environmental objectives, and the emphasis on maintaining impartiality and independence in the certification process.[37] Reaction of the banana industry[edit] In view of the lack of compliance with the above-mentioned criteria, banana growers' associations from Ecuador, Costa Rica, Colombia and Guatemala, published an open letter on July 17, 2020 to call on RFA to offer explanations about the process of socialization of the norm. In the letter, they set out their complaints, considering that only 2% of their demands had been taken into account. On July 23, 2020, they held a virtual meeting with Rainforest Alliance, in which the banana growers exchanged their perspectives on the new standard.[38] As Juan José Pons, coordinator of Ecuador's Banana Cluster, stated, the standard ""does not take into account the immense effort and related costs that we have made in the recent years, both in social and environmental matters. Our investment is not reflected in the final price, it has had no return, quite the contrary, European supermarkets always impose lower and lower prices"".[39] Despite the fact that this meeting led to new meetings of technical analysis of the standard, banana growers believe that Rainforest Alliance has not changed its position, and has remained firm on its standards. Faced with the lack of progress in the situation, the banana growers - who have expanded their reach to seven countries: Ecuador, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, the Dominican Republic and Panama - began contacting European retailers on their own to inform them about the consequences of applying the new RFA standards. In this context, they convened a tripartite table to discuss the standard with European retailers and RFA, which was held on November 27, 2020.[40] Despite RFA's refusal to attend,[41] the guilds and retail groups that participated agreed that RFA has the obligation to define the concept of Shared Responsibility, as well as to convene a specific committee for its development, made up of representatives from both producers and retail groups.[42] Rainforest Alliance responded by organizing another roundtable, in which they invited both European retailers and different banana groups. The meeting took place on December 18, 2020. Although the certifier affirmed having taken into account the comments of all stakeholders involved in the consultation process, especially banana growers, the banana grower groups who attended the meeting expressed again their dissatisfaction with the outcome. In particular, they considered that the way in which the meeting had been organized and managed did not allow for a constructive dialogue to take place. Furthermore, according to the Latin American banana groups, the explanations provided by the organization did not proceed to clarify the strategy by which the standard would be applied, which is still failing to fill several gaps around the implementation of the concept of shared responsibility. In order to show the on-going dialogue around the new certification program, Rainforest Alliance introduced in an article the organization's efforts to work with the banana sector to implement the new standards.[43] In the article, Rainforest Alliance referred to the roundtable that took place on December 18, 2020 as the meeting that ended the round of discussions with the banana sector and that will lead to the implementation of the standard, even if the organization has not yet defined the mechanism and scope for implementing Shared Responsibility and the Sustainability Differential.

It may require cleanup to comply with Wikipedia's content policies, particularly neutral point of view. Please discuss further on the talk page. (December 2017) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Daniel Katz Daniel Katz (born 1961) is an American environmentalist writer, speaker and activist. He is currently the Senior Program Director at the Overbrook Foundation, where he leads environmental giving in the areas of biodiversity conservation, sustainability, and climate change. Katz co-founded the Rainforest Alliance in 1986 at the age of 24, an organization instrumental in initiating the rainforest conservation movement.[1] The Rainforest Alliance is a non-governmental organization that focuses on environmental conservation throughout the world. Under Katz's leadership, the Rainforest Alliance became the first nonprofit organization to create a global program to monitor, evaluate, certify and audit forests. The Rainforest Alliance is known world-wide for creating independent third-party certification in forestry, agriculture and tourism. He was the Executive Director of the Rainforest Alliance from its inception until 2000;[2] today he serves as the Chairman of the Rainforest Alliance board. He has campaigned against the wastefulness of mail-order catalogs, of which the average household receives about 114 a year.[3] As a result of his role in starting up the Internet conservation website CatalogChoice.org, Katz has been described by PBS's Bill Moyers as the ""Dr. Phil of catalog clutter"" and ""the maven of the overstuffed mailbox."".[4] Catalog Choice was sold to TrustedID in May 2012, and the proceeds will be distributed through a new foundation.[5] Katz was raised in Cincinnati, Ohio. He earned his M.B.A. at the Stern School of Business, New York University and a B.A. from Ohio State University.[6] A former Kellogg Foundation National Leadership Fellow, Katz serves or has served on the boards of several organizations including Grist, People for the American Way, Green Sports Alliance, and others. He is the editor of two books: Why Freedom Matters: The Spirit of the Declaration of Independence in Prose, Poetry and Song (2003, Workman) and Tales from the Jungle: A Rainforest Reader (1995, Crown). Katz resides in New York City with his wife and two children. He was honored with the Ohio State University Department of Humanities Alumni Award of Distinction.[6] References[edit] ^ https://www.rainforest-alliance.org/bios/daniel-katz ^ People, February 28, 2000 ^ Katz, Daniel, at huffingtonpost.com, October 24, 2007 ^ PBS, November 16, 2007 ^ Paper Plastic Change[permanent dead link] ^ a b ""Ohio State University alumni site"".

South America has an area of 17,840,000 square kilometers (6,890,000 sq mi). Its population as of 2018[update] has been estimated at more than 423 million.[1][2] South America ranks fourth in area (after Asia, Africa, and North America) and fifth in population (after Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America). Brazil is by far the most populous South American country, with more than half of the continent's population, followed by Colombia, Argentina, Venezuela and Peru. In recent decades, Brazil has also generated half of the continent's GDP and has become the continent's first regional power.[6] Most of the population lives near the continent's western or eastern coasts while the interior and the far south are sparsely populated. The geography of western South America is dominated by the Andes mountains; in contrast, the eastern part contains both highland regions and vast lowlands where rivers such as the Amazon, Orinoco, and Paraná flow. Most of the continent lies in the tropics, except for a large part of the Southern Cone located in the middle latitudes. The continent's cultural and ethnic outlook has its origin with the interaction of indigenous peoples with European conquerors and immigrants and, more locally, with African slaves. Given a long history of colonialism, the overwhelming majority of South Americans speak Portuguese or Spanish, and societies and states reflect Western traditions. Relative to Europe, Asia and Africa, 20th-century South America has been a peaceful continent with few wars.[7] Contents 1 Geography 1.1 Outlying islands 1.1.1 Special cases 1.2 Climate 1.3 Fauna 2 History 2.1 Prehistory 2.2 Pre-Columbian civilizations 2.3 European colonization 2.4 Slavery in South America 2.5 Independence from Spain and Portugal 2.6 Nation-building and fragmentation 2.7 Wars and conflicts 2.8 Rise and fall of military dictatorships 3 Countries and territories 4 Government and politics 5 Demographics 5.1 Language 5.2 Religion 5.3 Ethnic demographics 5.3.1 Indigenous people 5.4 Populace 6 Economy 6.1 Economically largest cities as of 2014 7 Gallery 7.1 Tourism 8 Culture 8.1 Food and drink 8.2 Plastic arts 8.3 Sport 9 Infrastructure 9.1 Energy 9.2 Transport 10 See also 11 Notes 12 References 12.1 Citations 12.2 Sources 13 External links Geography[edit] Main article: Geography of South America See also: Category:Environment of South America A composite relief image of South America Contemporary political map of South America South America occupies the southern portion of the Americas. The continent is generally delimited on the northwest by the Darién watershed along the Colombia–Panama border, although some may consider the border instead to be the Panama Canal. Geopolitically[8] and geographically, all of Panama – including the segment east of the Panama Canal in the isthmus – is typically included in North America alone[9][10][11] and among the countries of Central America.[12][13] Almost all of mainland South America sits on the South American Plate. South America is home to the world's highest uninterrupted waterfall, Angel Falls in Venezuela; the highest single drop waterfall Kaieteur Falls in Guyana; the largest river by volume, the Amazon River; the longest mountain range, the Andes (whose highest mountain is Aconcagua at 6,962 m or 22,841 ft); the driest non-polar place on earth, the Atacama Desert;[14][15][16] the wettest place on earth, López de Micay in Colombia; the largest rainforest, the Amazon rainforest; the highest capital city, La Paz, Bolivia; the highest commercially navigable lake in the world, Lake Titicaca; and, excluding research stations in Antarctica, the world's southernmost permanently inhabited community, Puerto Toro, Chile. South America's major mineral resources are gold, silver, copper, iron ore, tin, and petroleum. These resources found in South America have brought high income to its countries especially in times of war or of rapid economic growth by industrialized countries elsewhere. However, the concentration in producing one major export commodity often has hindered the development of diversified economies. The fluctuation in the price of commodities in the international markets has led historically to major highs and lows in the economies of South American states, often causing extreme political instability. This is leading to efforts to diversify production to drive away from staying as economies dedicated to one major export. Brazil is the largest country in South America, covering approx. 47.3% of the continent's land area and encompassing around half of the continent's population.[17] The remaining countries and territories are divided among four subregions: the Andean states, Caribbean South America, The Guianas, and the Southern Cone.[18] Outlying islands[edit] Los Roques Archipelago, Venezuela Physiographically, South America also includes some of the nearby islands. The Dutch ABC islands (Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao), the islands of Trinidad and Tobago (Trinidad Island and Tobago Island etc.), the State of Nueva Esparta, and the Federal Dependencies of Venezuela sit on the northern portion of the South American continental shelf and are sometimes considered parts of the continent. Geopolitically, all the island countries and territories in the Caribbean have generally been grouped as a subregion of North America instead. By contrast, Aves Island (administered by Venezuela) and the Archipelago of San Andrés, Providencia and Santa Catalina (San Andrés Island, Providencia Island, and Santa Catalina Island etc., which are administered by Colombia) are politically parts of South American countries but physiographically parts of North America.[11][19][20] Other islands often associated with South America are the Chiloé Archipelago and Robinson Crusoe Island (both administered by Chile), Easter Island (generally considered a part of Oceania, also administered by Chile), the Galápagos Islands (administered by Ecuador), and Tierra del Fuego (split between Argentina and Chile). In the Atlantic Ocean, Brazil administers Fernando de Noronha, Trindade and Martim Vaz, and the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago, while the Falkland Islands (Spanish: Islas Malvinas) and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (biographically and hydrologically associated with Antarctica)[21] have been administered as two British Overseas Territories under the Crown, whose sovereignty over the islands is disputed by Argentina. Special cases[edit] An isolated volcanic island on the South American Plate, Ascension Island is geologically a part of South America.[22] Administered as a dependency of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, the island is geopolitically a part of Africa. An uninhabited sub-Antarctic volcanic island located in the South Atlantic Ocean, Bouvet Island (administered by Norway) is geographically, geologically, biographically, and hydrologically associated with Antarctica, but the United Nations geoscheme has included the territory in South America instead. Climate[edit] Köppen-Geiger climate classification map for South America[23] Map of all tropical cyclone tracks from 1945 to 2006 The distribution of the average temperatures in the region presents a constant regularity from the 30° of latitude south, when the isotherms tend, more and more, to be confused with the degrees of latitude.[24] In temperate latitudes, winters and summers are milder than in North America. This is because the most extensive part of the continent is in the equatorial zone (the region has more areas of equatorial plains than any other region.[24]), therefore giving the Southern Cone more oceanic influence, which moderates year round temperatures. The average annual temperatures in the Amazon basin oscillate around 27 °C (81 °F), with low thermal amplitudes and high rainfall indices. Between the Maracaibo Lake and the mouth of the Orinoco, predominates an equatorial climate of the type Congolese, that also includes parts of the Brazilian territory.[24] The east-central Brazilian plateau has a humid and warm tropical climate. The northern and eastern parts of the Argentine pampas have a humid subtropical climate with dry winters and humid summers of the Chinese type, while the western and eastern ranges have a subtropical climate of the dinaric type. At the highest points of the Andean region, climates are colder than the ones occurring at the highest point of the Norwegian fjords. In the Andean plateaus, the warm climate prevails, although it is tempered by the altitude, while in the coastal strip, there is an equatorial climate of the Guinean type. From this point until the north of the Chilean coast appear, successively, Mediterranean oceanic climate, temperate of the Breton type and, already in Tierra del Fuego, cold climate of the Siberian type.[24] The distribution of rainfall is related to the regime of winds and air masses. In most of the tropical region east of the Andes, winds blowing from the northeast, east and southeast carry moisture from the Atlantic, causing abundant rainfall. However, due to a consistently strong wind shear and a weak Intertropical Convergence Zone, South Atlantic tropical cyclones are rare.[25] In the Orinoco Llanos and in the Guianas Plateau, the precipitation levels go from moderate to high. The Pacific coast of Colombia and northern Ecuador are rainy regions, with Chocó in Colombia being the most rainy place in the world along with the northern slopes of Indian Himalayas.[26] The Atacama Desert, along this stretch of coast, is one of the driest regions in the world. The central and southern parts of Chile are subject to extratropical cyclones, and most of the Argentine Patagonia is desert. In the Pampas of Argentina, Uruguay and South of Brazil the rainfall is moderate, with rains well distributed during the year. The moderately dry conditions of the Chaco oppose the intense rainfall of the eastern region of Paraguay. In the semiarid coast of the Brazilian Northeast the rains are linked to a monsoon regime.[24] Important factors in the determination of climates are sea currents, such as the current Humboldt and Falklands. The equatorial current of the South Atlantic strikes the coast of the Northeast and there is divided into two others: the current of Brazil and a coastal current that flows to the northwest towards the Antilles, where there it moves towards northeast course thus forming the most Important and famous ocean current in the world, the Gulf Stream.[24][27] Fauna[edit] Main article: Fauna of South America South America is one of the most biodiverse continents on Earth. South America is home to many unique species of animals including the llama, anaconda, piranha, jaguar, vicuña, and tapir. The Amazon rainforests possess high biodiversity, containing a major proportion of Earth's species. History[edit] Main article: History of South America Prehistory[edit] Further information: History of South America § Pre-Columbian era The prehistoric Cueva de las Manos, or ""Cave of the Hands"", in Argentina South America is believed to have been joined with Africa from the late Paleozoic Era to the early Mesozoic Era, until the supercontinent Pangaea began to rift and break apart about 225 million years ago. Therefore, South America and Africa share similar fossils and rock layers. South America is thought to have been first inhabited by humans when people were crossing the Bering Land Bridge (now the Bering Strait) at least 15,000 years ago from the territory that is present-day Russia. They migrated south through North America, and eventually reached South America through the Isthmus of Panama. The first evidence for the existence of the human race in South America dates back to about 9000 BC, when squashes, chili peppers and beans began to be cultivated for food in the highlands of the Amazon Basin. Pottery evidence further suggests that manioc, which remains a staple food today, was being cultivated as early as 2000 BC.[28] By 2000 BC, many agrarian communities had been settled throughout the Andes and the surrounding regions. Fishing became a widespread practice along the coast, helping establish fish as a primary source of food. Irrigation systems were also developed at this time, which aided in the rise of an agrarian society.[28] South American cultures began domesticating llamas, vicuñas, guanacos, and alpacas in the highlands of the Andes circa 3500 BC. Besides their use as sources of meat and wool, these animals were used for transportation of goods.[28] Pre-Columbian civilizations[edit] Main article: Pre-Columbian era § South America The Inca estate of Machu Picchu, Peru is one of the New Seven Wonders of the World. The rise of plant growing and the subsequent appearance of permanent human settlements allowed for the multiple and overlapping beginnings of civilizations in South America. One of the earliest known South American civilizations was at Norte Chico, on the central Peruvian coast. Though a pre-ceramic culture, the monumental architecture of Norte Chico is contemporaneous with the pyramids of Ancient Egypt. Norte Chico governing class established a trade network and developed agriculture then followed by Chavín by 900 BC, according to some estimates and archaeological finds. Artifacts were found at a site called Chavín de Huantar in modern Peru at an elevation of 3,177 meters (10,423 ft). Chavín civilization spanned 900 BC to 300 BC. In the central coast of Peru, around the beginning of the 1st millennium AD, Moche (100 BC – 700 AD, at the northern coast of Peru), Paracas and Nazca (400 BC – 800 AD, Peru) cultures flourished with centralized states with permanent militia improving agriculture through irrigation and new styles of ceramic art. At the Altiplano, Tiahuanaco or Tiwanaku (100 BC – 1200 AD, Bolivia) managed a large commercial network based on religion. Around the 7th century, both Tiahuanaco and Wari or Huari Empire (600–1200, Central and northern Peru) expanded its influence to all the Andean region, imposing the Huari urbanism and Tiahuanaco religious iconography. The Muisca were the main indigenous civilization in what is now Colombia. They established the Muisca Confederation of many clans, or cacicazgos, that had a free trade network among themselves. They were goldsmiths and farmers. Other important Pre-Columbian cultures include: the Cañaris (in south central Ecuador), Chimú Empire (1300–1470, Peruvian northern coast), Chachapoyas, and the Aymaran kingdoms (1000–1450, Western Bolivia and southern Peru). Holding their capital at the great city of Cusco, the Inca civilization dominated the Andes region from 1438 to 1533. Known as Tawantin suyu, and ""the land of the four regions,"" in Quechua, the Inca Empire was highly distinct and developed. Inca rule extended to nearly a hundred linguistic or ethnic communities, some nine to fourteen million people connected by a 25,000 kilometer road system. Cities were built with precise, unmatched stonework, constructed over many levels of mountain terrain. Terrace farming was a useful form of agriculture. The Mapuche in Central and Southern Chile resisted the European and Chilean settlers, waging the Arauco War for more than 300 years. European colonization[edit] Main articles: Spanish colonization of the Americas and Portuguese colonization of the Americas Woodcut depicting Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci's first voyage (1497-98) to the New World, from the first known published edition of Vespucci's 1504 letter to Piero Soderini. In 1494, Portugal and Spain, the two great maritime European powers of that time, on the expectation of new lands being discovered in the west, signed the Treaty of Tordesillas, by which they agreed, with the support of the Pope, that all the land outside Europe should be an exclusive duopoly between the two countries.[29] The Inca–Spanish confrontation in the Battle of Cajamarca left thousands of natives dead. The treaty established an imaginary line along a north–south meridian 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands, roughly 46° 37' W. In terms of the treaty, all land to the west of the line (known to comprise most of the South American soil) would belong to Spain, and all land to the east, to Portugal. As accurate measurements of longitude were impossible at that time, the line was not strictly enforced, resulting in a Portuguese expansion of Brazil across the meridian. Beginning in the 1530s, the people and natural resources of South America were repeatedly exploited by foreign conquistadors, first from Spain and later from Portugal. These competing colonial nations claimed the land and resources as their own and divided it into colonies. European infectious diseases (smallpox, influenza, measles, and typhus) – to which the native populations had no immune resistance – caused large-scale depopulation of the native population under Spanish control. Systems of forced labor, such as the haciendas and mining industry's mit'a also contributed to the depopulation. After this, enslaved Africans, who had developed immunities to these diseases, were quickly brought in to replace them. The Portuguese explorer Pedro Álvares Cabral landing in Brazil in 1500 Dutch colonial houses in Paramaribo, Suriname A painting of the settlement of Pernambuco in colonial Brazil by Frans Post A map of the Spanish and Portuguese colonies in the Americas in 1790 The Spaniards were committed to converting their native subjects to Christianity and were quick to purge any native cultural practices that hindered this end; however, many initial attempts at this were only partially successful, as native groups simply blended Catholicism with their established beliefs and practices. Furthermore, the Spaniards brought their language to the degree they did with their religion, although the Roman Catholic Church's evangelization in Quechua, Aymara, and Guaraní actually contributed to the continuous use of these native languages albeit only in the oral form. Eventually, the natives and the Spaniards interbred, forming a mestizo class. At the beginning, many mestizos of the Andean region were offspring of Amerindian mothers and Spanish fathers. After independence, most mestizos had native fathers and European or mestizo mothers. Many native artworks were considered pagan idols and destroyed by Spanish explorers; this included many gold and silver sculptures and other artifacts found in South America, which were melted down before their transport to Spain or Portugal. Spaniards and Portuguese brought the western European architectural style to the continent, and helped to improve infrastructures like bridges, roads, and the sewer system of the cities they discovered or conquered. They also significantly increased economic and trade relations, not just between the old and new world but between the different South American regions and peoples. Finally, with the expansion of the Portuguese and Spanish languages, many cultures that were previously separated became united through that of Latin American. Guyana was initially colonized by the Dutch before coming under British control, though there was a brief period during the Napoleonic Wars when it was occupied by the French. The region was initially partitioned between the Dutch, French and British before fully coming under the control of Britain. Suriname was first explored by the Spanish in the 16th century and then settled by the English in the mid-17th century. It became a Dutch colony in 1667.

The indigenous peoples of the Americas in various European colonies were forced to work in European plantations and mines; along with enslaved Africans who were also introduced in the proceeding centuries via the slave trade. European colonists were heavily dependent on indigenous labor during the initial phases of settlement to maintain the subsistence economy, and natives were often captured by expeditions. The importation of African slaves began midway through the 16th century, but the enslavement of indigenous peoples continued well into the 17th and 18th centuries. The Atlantic slave trade brought enslaved Africans primarily to South American colonies, beginning with the Portuguese since 1502.[31] The main destinations of this phase were the Caribbean colonies and Brazil, as European nations built up economically slave-dependent colonies in the New World. Nearly 40% of all African slaves trafficked to the Americas went to Brazil. An estimated 4.9 million slaves from Africa came to Brazil during the period from 1501 to 1866.[32][33] In contrast to other European colonies in the Americas which mainly used the labor of African slaves, Spanish colonists mainly enslaved indigenous Americans. In 1750, the Portuguese Crown abolished the enslavement of indigenous peoples in colonial Brazil, under the belief that they were unfit for labor and less effective than enslaved Africans. Enslaved Africans were brought to the Americas on slave ships, under inhuman conditions and ill-treatment, and those who survived were sold in slave markets.[34] After independence, all South American countries maintained slavery for some time. The first South American country to abolish slavery was Chile in 1823, Uruguay in 1830, Bolivia in 1831, Colombia and Ecuador in 1851, Argentina in 1853, Peru and Venezuela in 1854, Suriname in 1863, Paraguay in 1869, and in 1888 Brazil was the last South American nation and the last country in western world to abolish slavery.[35] Independence from Spain and Portugal[edit] Main articles: Spanish American wars of independence and Independence of Brazil The European Peninsular War (1807–1814), a theater of the Napoleonic Wars, changed the political situation of both the Spanish and Portuguese colonies. First, Napoleon invaded Portugal, but the House of Braganza avoided capture by escaping to Brazil. Napoleon also captured King Ferdinand VII of Spain, and appointed his own brother instead. This appointment provoked severe popular resistance, which created Juntas to rule in the name of the captured king. The proclamation of the Independence of Brazil by Prince Pedro on 7 September 1822 The Guayaquil conference between José de San Martín and Simón Bolívar Coronation of Pedro I as 1st Emperor of Brazil Bernardo O'Higgins swears officially the independence of Chile. Many cities in the Spanish colonies, however, considered themselves equally authorized to appoint local Juntas like those of Spain. This began the Spanish American wars of independence between the patriots, who promoted such autonomy, and the royalists, who supported Spanish authority over the Americas. The Juntas, in both Spain and the Americas, promoted the ideas of the Enlightenment. Five years after the beginning of the war, Ferdinand VII returned to the throne and began the Absolutist Restoration as the royalists got the upper hand in the conflict. The independence of South America was secured by Simón Bolívar (Venezuela) and José de San Martín (Argentina), the two most important Libertadores. Bolívar led a great uprising in the north, then led his army southward towards Lima, the capital of the Viceroyalty of Peru. Meanwhile, San Martín led an army across the Andes Mountains, along with Chilean expatriates, and liberated Chile. He organized a fleet to reach Peru by sea, and sought the military support of various rebels from the Viceroyalty of Peru. The two armies finally met in Guayaquil, Ecuador, where they cornered the Royal Army of the Spanish Crown and forced its surrender. In the Portuguese Kingdom of Brazil, Dom Pedro I (also Pedro IV of Portugal), son of the Portuguese King Dom João VI, proclaimed the independent Kingdom of Brazil in 1822, which later became the Empire of Brazil. Despite the Portuguese loyalties of garrisons in Bahia, Cisplatina and Pará, independence was diplomatically accepted by the crown in Portugal in 1825, on condition of a high compensation paid by Brazil mediatized by the United Kingdom. Nation-building and fragmentation[edit] The Thirty-Three Orientals proclaimed the independence of Cisplatine Province. Battle of Fanfa, battle scene in Southern Brazil during the Ragamuffin War The newly independent nations began a process of fragmentation, with several civil and international wars. However, it was not as strong as in Central America. Some countries created from provinces of larger countries stayed as such up to modern times (such as Paraguay or Uruguay), while others were reconquered and reincorporated into their former countries (such as the Republic of Entre Ríos and the Riograndense Republic). The first separatist attempt was in 1820 by the Argentine province of Entre Ríos, led by a caudillo.[36] In spite of the ""Republic"" in its title, General Ramírez, its caudillo, never really intended to declare an independent Entre Rios. Rather, he was making a political statement in opposition to the monarchist and centralist ideas that back then permeated Buenos Aires politics. The ""country"" was reincorporated at the United Provinces in 1821. In 1825 the Cisplatine Province declared its independence from the Empire of Brazil, which led to the Cisplatine War between the imperials and the Argentine from the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata to control the region. Three years later, the United Kingdom intervened in the question by proclaiming a tie and creating in the former Cisplatina a new independent country: The Oriental Republic of Uruguay. Later in 1836, while Brazil was experiencing the chaos of the regency, Rio Grande do Sul proclaimed its independence motivated by a tax crisis. With the anticipation of the coronation of Pedro II to the throne of Brazil, the country could stabilize and fight the separatists, which the province of Santa Catarina had joined in 1839. The Conflict came to an end by a process of compromise by which both Riograndense Republic and Juliana Republic were reincorporated as provinces in 1845.[37][38] The Peru–Bolivian Confederation, a short-lived union of Peru and Bolivia, was blocked by Chile in the War of the Confederation (1836–1839) and again during the War of the Pacific (1879–1883). Paraguay was virtually destroyed by Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay in the Paraguayan War. Wars and conflicts[edit] Imperial Brazilian Navy and army troops during the Siege of Paysandú, 1865 The Uruguayan Army at the Battle of Sauce, 1866 The Imperial Brazilian Army during a procession in Paraguay, 1868 The Chilean Army in the battlefield of the Battle of Chorrillos, 1883 A German submarine under attack by Brazilian Air Force PBY Catalina, 31 July 1943 Despite the Spanish American wars of independence and the Brazilian War of Independence, the new nations quickly began to suffer with internal conflicts and wars among themselves. Most of the 1810 borders countries had initially accepted on the uti possidetis iuris principle had by 1848 either been altered by war or were constested.[39] In 1825 the proclamation of independence of Cisplatina led to the Cisplatine War between historical rivals the Empire of Brazil and the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata, Argentina's predecessor. The result was a stalemate, ending with the British government arranging for the independence of Uruguay. Soon after, another Brazilian province proclaimed its independence leading to the Ragamuffin War which Brazil won. Between 1836 and 1839 the War of the Confederation broke out between the short-lived Peru-Bolivian Confederation and Chile, with the support of the Argentine Confederation. The war was fought mostly in the actual territory of Peru and ended with a Confederate defeat and the dissolution of the Confederacy and annexation of many territories by Argentina. Meanwhile, the Argentine Civil Wars plagued Argentina since its independence. The conflict was mainly between those who defended the centralization of power in Buenos Aires and those who defended a confederation. During this period it can be said that ""there were two Argentines"": the Argentine Confederation and the Argentine Republic. At the same time the political instability in Uruguay led to the Uruguayan Civil War among the main political factions of the country. All this instability in the platine region interfered with the goals of other countries such as Brazil, which was soon forced to take sides. In 1851 the Brazilian Empire, supporting the centralizing unitarians, and the Uruguayan government invaded Argentina and deposed the caudillo, Juan Manuel Rosas, who ruled the confederation with an iron hand. Although the Platine War did not put an end to the political chaos and civil war in Argentina, it brought temporary peace to Uruguay where the Colorados faction won, supported by the Brazilian Empire, British Empire, French Empire and the Unitarian Party of Argentina.[40] Peace lasted only a short time: in 1864 the Uruguayan factions faced each other again in the Uruguayan War. The Blancos supported by Paraguay started to attack Brazilian and Argentine farmers near the borders. The Empire made an initial attempt to settle the dispute between Blancos and Colorados without success. In 1864, after a Brazilian ultimatum was refused, the imperial government declared that Brazil's military would begin reprisals. Brazil declined to acknowledge a formal state of war, and, for most of its duration, the Uruguayan–Brazilian armed conflict was an undeclared war which led to the deposition of the Blancos and the rise of the pro-Brazilian Colorados to power again. This angered the Paraguayan government, which even before the end of the war invaded Brazil, beginning the biggest and deadliest war in both South American and Latin American histories: the Paraguayan War.[citation needed] The Paraguayan War began when the Paraguayan dictator Francisco Solano López ordered the invasion of the Brazilian provinces of Mato Grosso and Rio Grande do Sul. His attempt to cross Argentinian territory without Argentinian approval led the pro-Brazilian Argentine government into the war. The pro-Brazilian Uruguayan government showed its support by sending troops. In 1865 the three countries signed the Treaty of the Triple Alliance against Paraguay. At the beginning of the war, the Paraguayans took the lead with several victories, until the Triple Alliance organized to repel the invaders and fight effectively. This was the second total war experience in the world after the American Civil War. It was deemed the greatest war effort in the history of all participating countries, taking almost 6 years and ending with the complete devastation of Paraguay. The country lost 40% of its territory to Brazil and Argentina and lost 60% of its population, including 90% of the men. The dictator Lopez was killed in battle and a new government was instituted in alliance with Brazil, which maintained occupation forces in the country until 1876.[41] The last South American war in the 19th century was the War of the Pacific with Bolivia and Peru on one side and Chile on the other. In 1879 the war began with Chilean troops occupying Bolivian ports, followed by Bolivia declaring war on Chile which activated an alliance treaty with Peru. The Bolivians were completely defeated in 1880 and Lima was occupied in 1881. The peace was signed with Peru in 1883 while a truce was signed with Bolivia in 1884. Chile annexed territories of both countries leaving Bolivia with no path to the sea.[42] In the new century, as wars became less violent and less frequent, Brazil entered into a small conflict with Bolivia for the possession of the Acre, which was acquired by Brazil in 1902. In 1917 Brazil declared war on the Central Powers, joined the allied side in the First World War and sent a small fleet to the Mediterranean Sea and some troops to be integrated with the British and French forces in the region. Brazil was the only South American country that participated in the First World War.[43][44] Later in 1932 Colombia and Peru entered a short armed conflict for territory in the Amazon. In the same year Paraguay declared war on Bolivia for possession of the Chaco, in a conflict that ended three years later with Paraguay's victory. Between 1941 and 1942 Peru and Ecuador fought decisively for territories claimed by both that were annexed by Peru, usurping Ecuador's frontier with Brazil.[45] Also in this period the first naval battle of World War II was fought on the continent, in the River Plate, between the British Royal Navy and German submarines.[46] The Germans still made numerous attacks on Brazilian ships on the coast, causing Brazil to declare war on the Axis powers in 1942, being the only South American country to fight in this war (and in both World Wars). Brazil sent naval and air forces to combat German and Italian submarines off the continent and throughout the South Atlantic, in addition to sending an expeditionary force to fight in the Italian Campaign.[47][48] A brief war was fought between Argentina and the UK in 1982, following an Argentine invasion of the Falkland Islands, which ended with an Argentine defeat. The last international war to be fought on South American soil was the 1995 Cenepa War between Ecuador and the Peru along their mutual border. Rise and fall of military dictatorships[edit] Argentine soldiers during the Falklands War Wars became less frequent in the 20th century, with Bolivia-Paraguay and Peru-Ecuador fighting the last inter-state wars. Early in the 20th century, the three wealthiest South American countries engaged in a vastly expensive naval arms race which began after the introduction of a new warship type, the ""dreadnought"". At one point, the Argentine government was spending a fifth of its entire yearly budget for just two dreadnoughts, a price that did not include later in-service costs, which for the Brazilian dreadnoughts was sixty percent of the initial purchase.[49][50] The Brazilian Minas Geraes class kindled an Argentine–Brazilian–Chilean naval arms race. The continent became a battlefield of the Cold War in the late 20th century. Some democratically elected governments of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay and Paraguay were overthrown or displaced by military dictatorships in the 1960s and 1970s. To curtail opposition, their governments detained tens of thousands of political prisoners, many of whom were tortured and/or killed on inter-state collaboration. Economically, they began a transition to neoliberal economic policies. They placed their own actions within the US Cold War doctrine of ""National Security"" against internal subversion. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Peru suffered from an internal conflict. In 1982, Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands, a British dependent territory. The Falklands War began and 74 days later Argentine forces surrendered.[51] Colombia has had an ongoing, though diminished internal conflict, which started in 1964 with the creation of Marxist guerrillas (FARC-EP) and then involved several illegal armed groups of leftist-leaning ideology as well as the private armies of powerful drug lords. Many of these are now defunct, and only a small portion of the ELN remains, along with the stronger, though also greatly reduced, FARC. Revolutionary movements and right-wing military dictatorships became common after World War II, but since the 1980s, a wave of democratization passed through the continent, and democratic rule is widespread now.[52] Nonetheless, allegations of corruption are still very common, and several countries have developed crises which have forced the resignation of their governments, although, on most occasions, regular civilian succession has continued. Presidents of UNASUR member states at the Second Brasília Summit on 23 May 2008. International indebtedness turned into a severe problem in the late 1980s, and some countries, despite having strong democracies, have not yet developed political institutions capable of handling such crises without resorting to unorthodox economic policies, as most recently illustrated by Argentina's default in the early 21st century.[53][neutrality is disputed] The last twenty years have seen an increased push towards regional integration, with the creation of uniquely South American institutions such as the Andean Community, Mercosur and Unasur. Notably, starting with the election of Hugo Chávez in Venezuela in 1998, the region experienced what has been termed a pink tide[citation needed] – the election of several leftist and center-left administrations to most countries of the area, except for the Guianas and Colombia.

South American flags Historically, the Hispanic countries were founded as Republican dictatorships led by caudillos. Brazil was the only exception, being a constitutional monarchy for its first 67 years of independence, until a coup d'état proclaimed a republic. In the late 19th century, the most democratic countries were Brazil,[56] Chile, Argentina and Uruguay.[57] All South American countries are presidential republics with the exception of Suriname, a parliamentary republic. French Guiana is a French overseas department, while the Falkland Islands and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands are British overseas territories. It is currently the only inhabited continent in the world without monarchies; the Empire of Brazil existed during the 19th century and there was an unsuccessful attempt to establish a Kingdom of Araucanía and Patagonia in southern Argentina and Chile. Also in the twentieth century, Suriname was established as a constituent kingdom of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and Guyana retained the British monarch as head of state for 4 years after its independence. Recently, an intergovernmental entity has been formed which aims to merge the two existing customs unions: Mercosur and the Andean Community, thus forming the third-largest trade bloc in the world.[58] This new political organization, known as Union of South American Nations, seeks to establish free movement of people, economic development, a common defense policy and the elimination of tariffs. Demographics[edit] Satellite view of South America at night from NASA. South America has a population of over 428 million people.There are several areas of sparse demographics such as tropical forests, the Atacama Desert and the icy portions of Patagonia. On the other hand, the continent presents regions of high population density, such as the great urban centers. The population is formed by descendants of Europeans (mainly Spaniards, Portuguese and Italians), Africans and Amerindians. There is a high percentage of Mestizos that vary greatly in composition by place. There is also a minor population of Asians,[further explanation needed] especially in Brazil, Peru, and Argentina. The two main languages are by far Spanish and Portuguese, followed by English, French and Dutch in smaller numbers. Language[edit] Official languages in South America Spanish and Portuguese are the most spoken languages in South America, with approximately 200 million speakers each. Spanish is the official language of most countries, along with other native languages in some countries. Portuguese is the official language of Brazil. Dutch is the official language of Suriname; English is the official language of Guyana, although there are at least twelve other languages spoken in the country, including Portuguese, Chinese, Hindustani and several native languages.[59] English is also spoken in the Falkland Islands. French is the official language of French Guiana and the second language in Amapá, Brazil. Indigenous languages of South America include Quechua in Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Chile and Colombia; Wayuunaiki in northern Colombia (La Guajira) and northwestern Venezuela (Zulia); Guaraní in Paraguay and, to a much lesser extent, in Bolivia; Aymara in Bolivia, Peru, and less often in Chile; and Mapudungun is spoken in certain pockets of southern Chile. At least three South American indigenous languages (Quechua, Aymara, and Guarani) are recognized along with Spanish as national languages. Other languages found in South America include Hindustani and Javanese in Suriname; Italian in Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Venezuela; and German in certain pockets of Argentina and Brazil. German is also spoken in many regions of the southern states of Brazil, Riograndenser Hunsrückisch being the most widely spoken German dialect in the country; among other Germanic dialects, a Brazilian form of East Pomeranian is also well represented and is experiencing a revival. Welsh remains spoken and written in the historic towns of Trelew and Rawson in the Argentine Patagonia. There are also small clusters of Japanese-speakers in Brazil, Colombia and Peru. Arabic speakers, often of Lebanese, Syrian, or Palestinian descent, can be found in Arab communities in Argentina, Colombia, Brazil, Venezuela and in Paraguay.[60] Religion[edit] Las Lajas Sanctuary, Ipiales, Colombia. Main articles: Religion in South America and Religion in Latin America See also: History of the Jews in Latin America and the Caribbean, Buddhism in Brazil, and Islam in Argentina An estimated 90% of South Americans are Christians[61] (82% Roman Catholic, 8% other Christian denominations mainly traditional Protestants and Evangelicals but also Orthodox), accounting for c. 19% of Christians worldwide. African descendent religions and Indigenous religions are also common throughout all South America, some examples of are Santo Daime, Candomblé, Umbanda and Encantados. Crypto-Jews or Marranos, conversos, and Anusim were an important part of colonial life in Latin America. Both Buenos Aires, Argentina and São Paulo, Brazil figure among the largest Jewish populations by urban area. East Asian religions such as Japanese Buddhism, Shintoism, and Shinto-derived Japanese New Religions are common in Brazil and Peru. Korean Confucianism is especially found in Brazil while Chinese Buddhism and Chinese Confucianism have spread throughout the continent. Kardecist Spiritism can be found in several countries. Hindus form 25% of the Guyanese population and 22% of Suriname's. [62][63] Muslims account for 6.8% of the Guyanese population and 13.9 of the Surinamese population.[62][63] Almost all Muslims in Suriname are either Javanese or Indians and in Guyana, most are Indian.

A Japanese-Brazilian Miko during a festival in Curitiba Former president of Brazil Lula and members of the Italian Brazilian community during the Grape Festival at Caxias do Sul Peruvian woman and her son Genetic admixture occurs at very high levels in South America. In Argentina, the European influence accounts for 65–79% of the genetic background, Amerindian for 17–31% and sub-Saharan African for 2–4%. In Colombia, the sub-Saharan African genetic background varied from 1% to 89%, while the European genetic background varied from 20% to 79%, depending on the region. In Peru, European ancestries ranged from 1% to 31%, while the African contribution was only 1% to 3%.[65] The Genographic Project determined the average Peruvian from Lima had about 28% European ancestry, 68% Native American, 2% Asian ancestry and 2% sub-Saharan African.[66] Descendants of indigenous peoples, such as the Quechua and Aymara, or the Urarina[67] of Amazonia make up the majority of the population in Bolivia (56%) and Peru (44%).[68][69] In Ecuador, Amerindians are a large minority that comprises two-fifths of the population. The native European population is also a significant element in most other former Portuguese colonies. People who identify as of primarily or totally European descent, or identify their phenotype as corresponding to such group, are more of a majority in Argentina,[70] and Uruguay[71] and more than half of the population of Chile (64.7%)[72] and (48.4%) in Brazil.[73][74][75] In Venezuela, according to the national census 42% of the population is primarily native Spanish, Italian and Portuguese descendants.[76] In Colombia, people who identify as European descendant are about 37%.[77][78] In Peru, European descendants are the third group in number (15%).[79] Mestizos (mixed European and Amerindian) are the largest ethnic group in Bolivia, Paraguay, Venezuela, Colombia[77] and Ecuador and the second group in Peru and Chile. South America is also home to one of the largest populations of Africans. This group is significantly present in Brazil, Colombia, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, Venezuela and Ecuador. Brazil followed by Peru have the largest Japanese, Korean and Chinese communities in South America, Lima has the largest ethnic Chinese community in Latin America.[80] Guyana and Suriname have the largest ethnic East Indian community.

The second largest country is Colombia with a population of 49,661,048. Argentina is the third most populous country with 44,361,150. While Brazil, Argentina, and Colombia maintain the largest populations, large city populations are not restricted to those nations. The largest cities in South America, by far, are São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires, Santiago, Lima, and Bogotá. These cities are the only cities on the continent to exceed eight million, and three of five in the Americas. Next in size are Caracas, Belo Horizonte, Medellin and Salvador. Five of the top ten metropolitan areas are in Brazil. These metropolitan areas all have a population of above 4 million and include the São Paulo metropolitan area, Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area, and Belo Horizonte metropolitan area. Whilst the majority of the largest metropolitan areas are within Brazil, Argentina is host to the second largest metropolitan area by population in South America: the Buenos Aires metropolitan region is above 13 million inhabitants. South America has also been witness to the growth of megapolitan areas. In Brazil four megaregions exist including the Expanded Metropolitan Complex of São Paulo with more than 32 million inhabitants. The others are the Greater Rio, Greater Belo Horizonte and Greater Porto Alegre. Colombia also has four megaregions which comprise 72% of its population, followed by Venezuela, Argentina and Peru which are also homes of megaregions.

Vineyard in Luján de Cuyo, province of Mendoza, Argentina South America relies less on the export of both manufactured goods and natural resources than the world average; merchandise exports from the continent were 16% of GDP on an exchange rate basis, compared to 25% for the world as a whole.[85] Brazil (the seventh largest economy in the world and the largest in South America) leads in terms of merchandise exports at $251 billion, followed by Venezuela at $93 billion, Chile at $86 billion, and Argentina at $84 billion.[85] Since 1930, the continent has experienced remarkable growth and diversification in most economic sectors. Most agricultural and livestock products are destined for the domestic market and local consumption. However, the export of agricultural products is essential for the balance of trade in most countries.[86] The main agrarian crops are export crops, such as soy and wheat. The production of staple foods such as vegetables, corn or beans is large, but focused on domestic consumption. Livestock raising for meat exports is important in Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and Colombia. In tropical regions the most important crops are coffee, cocoa and bananas, mainly in Brazil, Colombia and Ecuador. Traditionally, the countries producing sugar for export are Peru, Guyana and Suriname, and in Brazil, sugar cane is also used to make ethanol. On the coast of Peru, northeast and south of Brazil, cotton is grown. 50.5% of the South America's land surface is covered by forest,[87] but timber industries are small and directed to domestic markets. In recent years, however, transnational companies have been settling in the Amazon to exploit noble timber destined for export. The Pacific coastal waters of South America are the most important for commercial fishing. The anchovy catch reaches thousands of tonnes, and tuna is also abundant (Peru is a major exporter). The capture of crustaceans is remarkable, particularly in northeastern Brazil and Chile.[86] Only Brazil and Argentina are part of the G20 (industrial countries), while only Brazil is part of the G8+5 (the most powerful and influential nations in the world). In the tourism sector, a series of negotiations began in 2005 to promote tourism and increase air connections within the region. Punta del Este, Florianópolis and Mar del Plata are among the most important resorts in South America.[86] The most industrialized countries in South America are Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Venezuela and Uruguay respectively. These countries alone account for more than 75 percent of the region's economy and add up to a GDP of more than US$3.0 trillion. Industries in South America began to take on the economies of the region from the 1930s when the Great Depression in the United States and other countries of the world boosted industrial production in the continent. From that period the region left the agricultural side behind and began to achieve high rates of economic growth that remained until the early 1990s when they slowed due to political instabilities, economic crises and neoliberal policies.[86] Since the end of the economic crisis in Brazil and Argentina that occurred in the period from 1998 to 2002, which has led to economic recession, rising unemployment and falling population income, the industrial and service sectors have been recovering rapidly. Chile, Argentina and Brazil have recovered fastest, growing at an average of 5% per year. All of South America after this period has been recovering and showing good signs of economic stability, with controlled inflation and exchange rates, continuous growth, a decrease in social inequality and unemployment–factors that favor industry.[86] The main industries are: electronics, textiles, food, automotive, metallurgy, aviation, naval, clothing, beverage, steel, tobacco, timber, chemical, among others. Exports reach almost US$400 billion annually, with Brazil accounting for half of this.[86] The economic gap between the rich and poor in most South American nations is larger than on most other continents. The richest 10% receive over 40% of the nation's income in Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Paraguay,[88] while the poorest 20% receive 4% or less in Bolivia, Brazil, and Colombia.[89] This wide gap can be seen in many large South American cities where makeshift shacks and slums lie in the vicinity of skyscrapers and upper-class luxury apartments; nearly one in nine South Americans live on less than $2 per day (on a purchasing power parity basis).[90] Country GDP (nominal) in 2017 (in millions of dollars)[91] GDP (PPP) in 2017 (in millions of dollars)[91] GDP (PPP) per capita in 2017[91] Merchandise exports($bn), 2011[85] HDI in 2017 (rank)[92] Percent with less than $2 (PPP)per person per day[citation needed] Argentina 628,935 912,816 20,707 83.7 0.825 2.6 Bolivia 39,267 83,608 7,552 9.1 0.693 24.9 Brazil 2,140,940 3,216,031 15,485 250.8 0.759 10.8 Chile 251,220 455,941 24,796 86.1 0.845 2.7 Colombia 306,439 720,151 14,609 56.5 0.747 15.8 Ecuador 97,362 184,629 11,004 22.3 0.752 10.6 Falkland Islands[93] (UK) 206.4 206.4 70,800 0.26 French Guiana[94] (France) 4,456 4,456 19,728 1.3 Guyana 3,591 6,398 8,306 0.9 0.654 18.0 Paraguay 28,743 68,005 9,779 9.8 0.702 13.2 Peru 207,072 429,711 13,501 46.3 0.750 12.7 Suriname 3,641 7,961 13,934 1.6 0.720 27.2 Uruguay 58,123 77,800 22,271 8.0 0.804 2.2 Venezuela 251,589 404,109 12,856 92.6 0.761 12.9 Total 3,836,569 6,642,623 17,852 669.1 0.772 11.3 Economically largest cities as of 2014[edit] Rank City Country GDP in Int$ bn[95] Population (mil)[95] GDP per capita 1 São Paulo Brazil $430 20,847,500 $20,650 2 Buenos Aires Argentina $315 13,381,800 $23,606 3 Lima Peru $176 10,674,100 $16,530 4 Rio de Janeiro Brazil $176 12,460,200 $14,176 5 Santiago Chile $171 7,164,400 $32,929 6 Bogotá Colombia $160 9,135,800 $17,497 7 Brasília Brazil $141 3,976,500 $35,689 8 Belo Horizonte Brazil $84 5,595,800 $15,134 9 Porto Alegre Brazil $62 4,120,900 $15,078 10 Campinas Brazil $59 2,854,200 $20,759 Sugarcane plantation in São Paulo.

This year, the country produced 35.1 billion liters.[100] In 2019, Brazil was the 4th largest pork producer in the world, with almost 4 million tonnes.[101] In 2018, Argentina was the 4th largest producer of beef in the world, with a production of 3 million tonnes (behind only USA, Brazil and China). Uruguay is also a major meat producer. In 2018, it produced 589 thousand tonnes of beef. [102] In chicken meat production, Argentina ranks among the 15 largest producers in the world, and Peru and Colombia among the 20 biggest producers. In beef production, Colombia is one of the 20 largest producers in the world. In honey production, Argentina ranks among the 5 largest producers in the world, and Brazil among the 15 largest. In terms of production of cow's milk, Argentina ranks among the 20 largest producers in the world. [103] EMS, the largest Brazilian pharmaceutical industry Braskem, the largest Brazilian chemical industry The World Bank annually lists the top manufacturing countries by total manufacturing value. According to the 2019 list, Brazil has the thirteenth most valuable industry in the world (US$173.6 billion), Venezuela the thirtieth largest (US$58.2 billion, however, it depends on oil to obtain this value), Argentina the 31st largest (US$57.7 billion), Colombia the 46th largest (US$35.4 billion), Peru the 50th largest (US$28.7 billion) and Chile the 51st largest (US$28.3 billion).[104] Brazil has the third-largest manufacturing sector in the Americas. Accounting for 28.5 percent of GDP, Brazil's industries range from automobiles, steel, and petrochemicals to computers, aircraft (Embraer), food, pharmaceutical, footwear, metallurgy and consumer durables. In the food industry, in 2019, Brazil was the second largest exporter of processed foods in the world.[105][106][107] In 2016, the country was the 2nd largest producer of pulp in the world and the 8th producer of paper.[108][109][110] In the footwear industry, in 2019, Brazil ranked 4th among world producers.[111][112][113][114] In 2019, the country was the 8th producer of vehicles and the 9th producer of steel in the world.[115][116][117] In 2018, the chemical industry of Brazil was the 8th in the world.[118][119][120] In textile industry, Brazil, although it was among the 5 largest world producers in 2013, is very little integrated in world trade.[121] Cerro Rico, Potosi, Bolivia, still a major silver mine Amethyst mine in Ametista do Sul. South America is a major producer of gems such as amethyst, topaz, emerald, aquamarine and tourmaline Iron mine in Minas Gerais. Brazil is the world's second largest iron ore exporter. Mining is one of the most important economic sectors in South America, especially for Chile, Peru and Bolivia, whose economies are highly dependent on this sector. The continent has large productions of gold (mainly in Peru, Brazil and Argentina);[122] silver (mainly in Peru, Chile, Bolivia and Argentina);[123] copper (mainly in Chile, Peru and Brazil);[124] iron ore (Brazil, Peru and Chile);[125] zinc (Peru, Bolivia and Brazil);[126] molybdenum (Chile and Peru);[127] lithium (Chile, Argentina and Brazil);[128] lead (Peru and Bolivia);[129] bauxite (Brazil);[130] tin (Peru, Bolivia and Brazil);[131] manganese (Brazil);[132] antimony (Bolivia and Ecuador);[133] nickel (Brazil);[134] niobium (Brazil);[135] rhenium (Chile);[136] iodine (Chile),[137] among others. Brazil stands out in the extraction of iron ore (where it is the 2nd largest producer and exporter in the world - iron ore is usually one of the 3 export products that generate the greatest value in the country's trade balance), copper, gold, bauxite (one of the 5 largest producers in the world), manganese (one of the 5 largest producers in the world), tin (one of the largest producers in the world), niobium (concentrates 98% of reserves known to the world) and nickel. In terms of gemstones, Brazil is the world's largest producer of amethyst, topaz, agate and one of the main producers of tourmaline, emerald, aquamarine, garnet and opal.[138][139][140][141][142][143] Chile contributes about a third of the world copper production.[144] In addition to copper, Chile was, in 2019, the world's largest producer of iodine[145] and rhenium,[146] the second largest producer of lithium[147] and molybdenum,[148] the sixth largest producer of silver,[149] the seventh largest producer of salt,[150] the eighth largest producer of potash,[151] the thirteenth producer of sulfur[152] and the thirteenth producer of iron ore[153] in the world. In 2019, Peru was the 2nd largest world producer of copper[154] and silver,[155] 8th largest world producer of gold,[156] 3rd largest world producer of lead,[157] 2nd largest world producer of zinc,[158] 4th largest world producer of tin,[159] 5th largest world producer of boron[160] and 4th largest world producer of molybdenum.[161] In 2019, Bolivia was the 8th largest world producer of silver;[162] 4th largest world producer of boron;[163] 5th largest world producer of antimony;[164] 5th largest world producer of tin;[165] 6th largest world producer of tungsten;[166] 7th largest producer of zinc,[167] and the 8th largest producer of lead. [168] [169][170] In 2019, Argentina was the 4th largest world producer of lithium,[171] the 9th largest world producer of silver,[172] the 17th largest world producer of gold[173] and the 7th largest world producer of boron.[174] Colombia is the world's largest producer of emeralds. [175] In the production of gold, among 2006 and 2017, the country produced 15 tons per year until 2007, when its production increased significantly, breaking a record of 66.1 tons extracted in 2012. In 2017, it extracted 52.2 tons. The country is among the 25 largest gold producers in the world. [176] In the production of silver, in 2017 the country extracted 15,5 tons. [177] [178][179] In the production of oil, Brazil was the 10th largest oil producer in the world in 2019, with 2.8 million barrels / day. Venezuela was the 21st largest, with 877 thousand barrels / day, Colombia in 22nd with 886 thousand barrels / day, Ecuador in 28th with 531 thousand barrels / day and Argentina 29th with 507 thousand barrels / day. As Venezuela and Ecuador consume little oil and export most of their production, they are part of OPEC. Venezuela had a big drop in production after 2015 (where it produced 2.5 million barrels / day), falling in 2016 to 2.2 million, in 2017 to 2 million, in 2018 to 1.4 million and in 2019 to 877 thousand, due to lack of investments. [180] In the production of natural gas, in 2018, Argentina produced 1524 bcf (billion cubic feet), Venezuela 946, Brazil 877, Bolivia 617, Peru 451, Colombia 379. [181] In the beginning of 2020, in the production of oil and natural gas, Brazil exceeded 4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, for the first time. In January 2021, 3.168 million barrels of oil per day and 138.753 million cubic meters of natural gas were extracted.[182] In the production of coal, the continent had 2 of the 30 largest world producers in 2018: Colombia (12th) and Brazil (27th).

Tourism[edit] Tourism has increasingly become a significant source of income for many South American countries.[184][185] Historical relics, architectural and natural wonders, a diverse range of foods and culture, vibrant and colorful cities, and stunning landscapes attract millions of tourists every year to South America. Some of the most visited places in the region are Iguazu Falls, Recife, Olinda, Machu Picchu, Bariloche, the Amazon rainforest, Rio de Janeiro, São Luís, Salvador, Fortaleza, Maceió, Buenos Aires, Florianópolis, San Ignacio Miní, Isla Margarita, Natal, Lima, São Paulo, Angel Falls, Brasília, Nazca Lines, Cuzco, Belo Horizonte, Lake Titicaca, Salar de Uyuni, La Paz, Jesuit Missions of Chiquitos, Los Roques archipelago, Gran Sabana, Patagonia, Tayrona National Natural Park, Santa Marta, Bogotá, Cali, Medellín, Cartagena, Perito Moreno Glacier and the Galápagos Islands.[186][187] In 2016 Brazil hosted the 2016 Summer Olympics.

Culture[edit] Teatro Solis, Uruguay.National Library, Brazil.Arya Dewaker Hindu temple, Paramaribo, Suriname. South Americans are culturally influenced by their indigenous peoples, the historic connection with the Iberian Peninsula and Africa, and waves of immigrants from around the globe. South American nations have a rich variety of music. Some of the most famous genres include vallenato and cumbia from Colombia, pasillo from Colombia and Ecuador, samba, bossa nova and música sertaneja from Brazil, and tango from Argentina and Uruguay. Also well known is the non-commercial folk genre Nueva Canción movement which was founded in Argentina and Chile and quickly spread to the rest of the Latin America. Tango show in Buenos Aires, typical Argentine dance.Carmen Miranda, Portuguese Brazilian singer helped popularize samba internationally. People on the Peruvian coast created the fine guitar and cajon duos or trios in the most mestizo (mixed) of South American rhythms such as the Marinera (from Lima), the Tondero (from Piura), the 19th century popular Creole Valse or Peruvian Valse, the soulful Arequipan Yaravi, and the early 20th century Paraguayan Guarania. In the late 20th century, Spanish rock emerged by young hipsters influenced by British pop and American rock. Brazil has a Portuguese-language pop rock industry as well a great variety of other music genres. In the central and western regions of Bolivia, Andean and folklore music like Diablada, Caporales and Morenada are the most representative of the country, which were originated by European, Aymara and Quechua influences. The literature of South America has attracted considerable critical and popular acclaim, especially with the Latin American Boom of the 1960s and 1970s, and the rise of authors such as Mario Vargas Llosa, Gabriel García Márquez in novels and Jorge Luis Borges and Pablo Neruda in other genres. The Brazilians Machado de Assis and João Guimarães Rosa are widely regarded as the greatest Brazilian writers. Food and drink[edit] Because of South America's broad ethnic mix, South American cuisine has African, Mestizo, South Asian, East Asian, and European influences. Bahia, Brazil, is especially well known for its West African–influenced cuisine. Argentines, Chileans, Uruguayans, Brazilians, Bolivians, and Venezuelans regularly consume wine. People in Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, southern Chile, Bolivia and Southern Brazil drink mate, an herb which is brewed. The Paraguayan version, terere, differs from other forms of mate in that it is served cold. Pisco is a liquor distilled from grapes in Peru and Chile. Peruvian cuisine mixes elements from Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, Italian, African, Arab, Andean, and Amazonic food. Plastic arts[edit] Bird (UOB Plaza, Singapore), sculpture of Colombian artist Fernando Botero The artist Oswaldo Guayasamín (1919–1999) from Ecuador, represented with his painting style the feeling of the peoples of Latin America[188] highlighting social injustices in various parts of the world. The Colombian Fernando Botero (1932) is one of the greatest exponents of painting and sculpture that continues still active and has been able to develop a recognizable style of his own.[189] For his part, the Venezuelan Carlos Cruz-Diez has contributed significantly to contemporary art,[190] with the presence of works around the world. Currently several emerging South American artists are recognized by international art critics: Guillermo Lorca – Chilean painter,[191][192] Teddy Cobeña – Ecuadorian sculptor and recipient of international sculpture award in France)[193][194][195] and Argentine artist Adrián Villar Rojas[196][197] – winner of the Zurich Museum Art Award among many others. Sport[edit] Main article: Sport in South America Maracanã Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Panorama of the interior of the Maracanã stadium during the closing ceremony of the 2014 FIFA World Cup A wide range of sports are played in the continent of South America, with football being the most popular overall, while baseball is the most popular in Venezuela. Other sports include basketball, cycling, polo, volleyball, futsal, motorsports, rugby (mostly in Argentina and Uruguay), handball, tennis, golf, field hockey, boxing and cricket. South America hosted its first Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 2016, and has hosted the Youth Olympic Games in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 2018. South America shares with Europe supremacy over the sport of football as all winners in FIFA World Cup history and all winning teams in the FIFA Club World Cup have come from these two continents. Brazil holds the record at the FIFA World Cup with five titles in total of all countries.[198] Argentina and Uruguay have two titles each. So far five South American nations have hosted the tournament including the first edition in Uruguay (1930). Two were from Brazil (1950, 2014), Chile (1962), and Argentina (1978). South America is home to the longest running international football tournament; the Copa América, which has been regularly contested since 1916. Uruguay won the Copa América a record 15 times, surpassing hosts like Argentina in 2011 to reach 15 titles (they were previously equal at 14 titles each during the 2011 Copa América). Also, in South America, a multi-sport event, the South American Games, are held every four years. The first edition was held in La Paz in 1978 and the most recent took place in Santiago in 2014. South American Cricket Championship is an international one-day cricket tournament played since 1995 featuring national teams from South America and certain other invited sides including teams from North America, currently played annually but until 2013 was usually played every two seasons. Infrastructure[edit] Jepírachi wind farm in the Guajira Peninsula. Energy[edit] Due to the diversity of topography and pluviometric precipitation conditions, the region's water resources vary enormously in different areas. In the Andes, navigation possibilities are limited, except for the Magdalena River, Lake Titicaca and the lakes of the southern regions of Chile and Argentina. Irrigation is an important factor for agriculture from northwestern Peru to Patagonia. Less than 10% of the known electrical potential of the Andes had been used until the mid-1960s. The Brazilian Highlands has a much higher hydroelectric potential than the Andean region and its possibilities of exploitation are greater due to the existence of several large rivers with high margins and the occurrence of great differences forming huge cataracts, such as those of Paulo Afonso, Iguaçu and others. The Amazon River system has about 13,000 km of waterways, but its possibilities for hydroelectric use are still unknown. Most of the continent's energy is generated through hydroelectric power plants, but there is also an important share of thermoelectric and wind energy. Brazil and Argentina are the only South American countries that generate nuclear power, each with two nuclear power plants. In 1991 these countries signed a peaceful nuclear cooperation agreement. Panoramic view of the Itaipu Dam, the second largest of the world in energy production. Wind power in Parnaíba. Angra Nuclear Power Plant in Angra dos Reis, Rio de Janeiro Pirapora Solar Complex, the largest in Brazil and Latin America with a capacity of 321 MW. The Brazilian government has undertaken an ambitious program to reduce dependence on imported petroleum. Imports previously accounted for more than 70% of the country's oil needs but Brazil became self-sufficient in oil in 2006–2007. Brazil was the 10th largest oil producer in the world in 2019, with 2.8 million barrels / day. Production manages to supply the country's demand.[180] In the beginning of 2020, in the production of oil and natural gas, the country exceeded 4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, for the first time. In January this year, 3.168 million barrels of oil per day and 138.753 million cubic meters of natural gas were extracted.[182] Brazil is one of the main world producers of hydroelectric power. In 2019, Brazil had 217 hydroelectric plants in operation, with an installed capacity of 98,581 MW, 60.16% of the country's energy generation.[199] In the total generation of electricity, in 2019 Brazil reached 170,000 megawatts of installed capacity, more than 75% from renewable sources (the majority, hydroelectric).[200][201] In 2013, the Southeast Region used about 50% of the load of the National Integrated System (SIN), being the main energy consuming region in the country. The region's installed electricity generation capacity totaled almost 42,500 MW, which represented about a third of Brazil's generation capacity. The hydroelectric generation represented 58% of the region's installed capacity, with the remaining 42% corresponding basically to the thermoelectric generation. São Paulo accounted for 40% of this capacity; Minas Gerais by about 25%; Rio de Janeiro by 13.3%; and Espírito Santo accounted for the rest. The South Region owns the Itaipu Dam, which was the largest hydroelectric plant in the world for several years, until the inauguration of Three Gorges Dam in China. It remains the second largest operating hydroelectric in the world. Brazil is the co-owner of the Itaipu Plant with Paraguay: the dam is located on the Paraná River, located on the border between countries. It has an installed generation capacity of 14 GW for 20 generating units of 700 MW each. North Region has large hydroelectric plants, such as Belo Monte Dam and Tucuruí Dam, which produce much of the national energy. Brazil's hydroelectric potential has not yet been fully exploited, so the country still has the capacity to build several renewable energy plants in its territory.[202][203] As of February 2021,[ref] according to ONS, total installed capacity of wind power was 19.1 GW, with average capacity factor of 58%.[204] While the world average wind production capacity factors is 24.7%, there are areas in Northern Brazil, specially in Bahia State, where some wind farms record with average capacity factors over 60%;[205][206] the average capacity factor in the Northeast Region is 45% in the coast and 49% in the interior.[207] In 2019, wind energy represented 9% of the energy generated in the country.[208] In 2019, it was estimated that the country had an estimated wind power generation potential of around 522 GW (this, only onshore), enough energy to meet three times the country's current demand.[209][210] In 2020 Brazil was the 8th country in the world in terms of installed wind power (17.2 GW). [211] Nuclear energy accounts for about 4% of Brazil's electricity.[212] The nuclear power generation monopoly is owned by Eletronuclear (Eletrobrás Eletronuclear S/A), a wholly owned subsidiary of Eletrobrás. Nuclear energy is produced by two reactors at Angra. It is located at the Central Nuclear Almirante Álvaro Alberto (CNAAA) on the Praia de Itaorna in Angra dos Reis, Rio de Janeiro. It consists of two pressurized water reactors, Angra I, with capacity of 657 MW, connected to the power grid in 1982, and Angra II, with capacity of 1,350 MW, connected in 2000. A third reactor, Angra III, with a projected output of 1,350 MW, is planned to be finished.[213] As of May 2021,[ref] according to ONS, total installed capacity of photovoltaic solar was 9.4 GW, with average capacity factor of 23%.[214] Some of the most irradiated Brazilian States are MG (""Minas Gerais""), BA (""Bahia"") and GO (Goiás), which have indeed world irradiation level records.[215][206][216] In 2019, solar power represented 1.27% of the energy generated in the country.[208] In 2020, Brazil was the 14th country in the world in terms of installed solar power (7.8 GW). [217] In 2020, Brazil was the 2nd largest country in the world in the production of energy through biomass (energy production from solid biofuels and renewable waste), with 15,2 GW installed.[218] After Brazil, Colombia is the country in South America that most stands out in energy production. In 2020, the country was the 20th largest petroleum producer in the world, and in 2015 it was the 19th largest exporter. In natural gas, the country was, in 2015, the 40th largest producer in the world. Colombia's biggest highlight is in coal, where the country was, in 2018, the world's 12th largest producer and the 5th largest exporter. In renewable energies, in 2020, the country ranked 45th in the world in terms of installed wind energy (0.5 GW), 76th in the world in terms of installed solar energy (0.1 GW) and 20th in the world in terms of installed hydroelectric power (12.6 GW). Venezuela, which was one of the world's largest oil producers (about 2.5 million barrels/day in 2015) and one of the largest exporters, due to its political problems, has had its production drastically reduced in recent years: in 2016, it dropped to 2.2 million, in 2017 to 2 million, in 2018 to 1.4 million and in 2019 to 877 thousand, reaching only 300,000 barrels/day at a given point. The country also stands out in hydroelectricity, where it was the 14th country in the world in terms of installed capacity in 2020 (16,5 GW). Argentina was, in 2017, the 18th largest producer in the world, and the largest producer in Latin America, of natural gas, in addition to being the 28th largest oil producer; although the country has the Vaca Muerta field, which holds close to 16 billion barrels of technically recoverable shale oil, and is the second largest shale natural gas deposit in the world, the country lacks the capacity to exploit the deposit: it is necessary capital, technology and knowledge that can only come from offshore energy companies, who view Argentina and its erratic economic policies with considerable suspicion, not wanting to invest in the country. In renewable energies, in 2020, the country ranked 27th in the world in terms of installed wind energy (2.6 GW), 42nd in the world in terms of installed solar energy (0.7 GW) and 21st in the world in terms of installed hydroelectric power (11.3 GW). The country has great future potential for the production of wind energy in the Patagonia region. Chile, although currently not a major energy producer, has great future potential for solar energy production in the Atacama Desert region. Paraguay stands out today in hydroelectric production thanks to the Itaipu Power Plant. Bolivia stand out in the production of natural gas, where it was the 31st largest in the world in 2015. Ecuador, because it consumes little energy, is part of OPEC and was the 27th largest oil producer in the world in 2020, being the 22nd largest exporter in 2014.[219] [220] [221][222] [223] Transport[edit] Rodovia dos Bandeirantes, Brazil Ruta 9 / 14, in Zarate, Argentina Rio–Niterói Bridge Rio de Janeiro International Airport Port of Itajaí, Santa Catarina, Brazil Stretch of the Pan-American Highway in Argentina The Port of Callao in Lima The La Paz cable car system in Bolivia is home to both the longest and highest urban cable car network in the world Transport in South America is basically carried out using the road mode, the most developed in the region. There is also a considerable infrastructure of ports and airports. The railway and fluvial sector, although it has potential, is usually treated in a secondary way. Brazil has more than 1.7 million km of roads, of which 215,000 km are paved, and about 14,000 km are divided highways. The two most important highways in the country are BR-101 and BR-116.[224] Argentina has more than 600,000 km of roads, of which about 70,000 km are paved, and about 2,500 km are divided highways. The three most important highways in the country are Route 9, Route 7 and Route 14. [224] Colombia has about 210,000 km of roads, and about 2,300 km are divided highways. [225] Chile has about 82,000 km of roads, 20,000 km of which are paved, and about 2,000 km are divided highways. The most important highway in the country is the Route 5 (Pan-American Highway)[226] These 4 countries are the ones with the best road infrastructure and with the largest number of double-lane highways. Due to the Andes Mountains, Amazon River and Amazon Forest, there have always been difficulties in implementing transcontinental or bioceanic highways. Practically the only route that existed was the one that connected Brazil to Buenos Aires, in Argentina and later to Santiago, in Chile. However, in recent years, with the combined effort of countries, new routes have started to emerge, such as Brazil-Peru (Interoceanic Highway), and a new highway between Brazil, Paraguay, northern Argentina and northern Chile (Bioceanic Corridor). There are more than 2,000 airports in Brazil. The country has the second largest number of airports in the world, behind only the United States. São Paulo International Airport, located in the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo, is the largest and busiest in the country - the airport connects São Paulo to practically all major cities around the world. Brazil has 44 international airports, such as those in Rio de Janeiro, Brasília, Belo Horizonte, Porto Alegre, Florianópolis, Cuiabá, Salvador, Recife, Fortaleza, Belém and Manaus, among others. Argentina has important international airports such as Buenos Aires, Cordoba, Bariloche, Mendoza, Salta, Puerto Iguazú, Neuquén and Usuhaia, among others. Chile has important international airports such as Santiago, Antofagasta, Puerto Montt, Punta Arenas and Iquique, among others. Colombia has important international airports such as Bogotá, Medellín, Cartagena, Cali and Barranquilla, among others. Other important airports are those in the capitals of Uruguay (Montevideo), Paraguay (Asunción), Peru (Lima), Bolivia (La Paz) and Ecuador (Quito). The 10 busiest airports in South America in 2017 were: São Paulo-Guarulhos (Brazil), Bogotá (Colombia), São Paulo-Congonhas (Brazil), Santiago (Chile), Lima (Peru), Brasília (Brazil), Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), Buenos Aires-Aeroparque (Argentina), Buenos Aires-Ezeiza (Argentina), and Minas Gerais (Brazil).[227] About ports, Brazil has some of the busiest ports in South America, such as Port of Santos, Port of Rio de Janeiro, Port of Paranaguá, Port of Itajaí, Port of Rio Grande, Port of São Francisco do Sul and Suape Port. Argentina has ports such as Port of Buenos Aires and Port of Rosario. Chile has important ports in Valparaíso, Caldera, Mejillones, Antofagasta, Iquique, Arica and Puerto Montt. Colombia has important ports such as Buenaventura, Cartagena Container Terminal and Puerto Bolivar. Peru has important ports in Callao, Ilo and Matarani. The 15 busiest ports in South America are: Port of Santos (Brazil), Port of Bahia de Cartagena (Colombia), Callao (Peru), Guayaquil (Ecuador), Buenos Aires (Argentina), San Antonio (Chile), Buenaventura (Colombia), Itajaí (Brazil), Valparaíso (Chile), Montevideo (Uruguay), Paranaguá (Brazil), Rio Grande (Brazil), São Francisco do Sul (Brazil), Manaus (Brazil) and Coronel (Chile).[228] The Brazilian railway network has an extension of about 30,000 kilometers. It's basically used for transporting ores.[229] The Argentine rail network, with 47,000 km of tracks, was one of the largest in the world and continues to be the most extensive in Latin America. It came to have about 100,000 km of rails, but the lifting of tracks and the emphasis placed on motor transport gradually reduced it. It has four different trails and international connections with Paraguay, Bolivia, Chile, Brazil and Uruguay. Chile has almost 7,000 km of railways, with connections to Argentina, Bolivia and Peru. Colombia has only about 3,500 km of railways.[230] Among the main Brazilian waterways, two stand out: Hidrovia Tietê-Paraná (which has a length of 2,400 km, 1,600 on the Paraná River and 800 km on the Tietê River, draining agricultural production from the states of Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Goiás and part of Rondônia, Tocantins and Minas Gerais) and Hidrovia do Solimões-Amazonas (it has two sections: Solimões, which extends from Tabatinga to Manaus, with approximately 1600 km, and Amazonas, which extends from Manaus to Belém, with 1650 km. Almost entirely passenger transport from the Amazon plain is done by this waterway, in addition to practically all cargo transportation that is directed to the major regional centers of Belém and Manaus). In Brazil, this transport is still underutilized: the most important waterway stretches, from an economic point of view, are found in the Southeast and South of the country. Its full use still depends on the construction of locks, major dredging works and, mainly, of ports that allow intermodal integration. In Argentina, the waterway network is made up of the La Plata, Paraná, Paraguay and Uruguay rivers. The main river ports are Zárate and Campana. The port of Buenos Aires is historically the first in individual importance, but the area known as Up-River, which stretches along 67 km of the Santa Fé portion of the Paraná River, brings together 17 ports that concentrate 50% of the total exports of the country. Only two railroads are continental: the Transandina, which connects Buenos Aires, in Argentina to Valparaíso, in Chile, and the Brazil–Bolivia Railroad, which makes it the connection between the port of Santos in Brazil and the city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, in Bolivia. In addition, there is the Pan-American Highway, which crosses Argentina and the Andean countries from north to south, although some stretches are unfinished.[231] Two areas of greater density occur in the railway sector: the platinum network, which develops around the Platine region, largely belonging to Argentina, with more than 45,000 km in length; And the Southeast Brazil network, which mainly serves the state of São Paulo, state of Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais. Brazil and Argentina also stand out in the road sector. In addition to the modern roads that extend through northern Argentina and south-east and south of Brazil, a vast road complex aims to link Brasília, the federal capital, to the South, Southeast, Northeast and Northern regions of Brazil. South America has one of the largest bays of navigable inland waterways in the world, represented mainly by the Amazon basin, the Platine basin, the São Francisco and the Orinoco basins, Brazil having about 54,000 km navigable, while Argentina has 6,500 km and Venezuela, 1,200 km. The two main merchant fleets also belong to Brazil and Argentina. The following are those of Chile, Venezuela, Peru and Colombia. The largest ports in commercial movement are those of Buenos Aires, Santos, Rio de Janeiro, Bahía Blanca, Rosario, Valparaíso, Recife, Salvador, Montevideo, Paranaguá, Rio Grande, Fortaleza, Belém and Maracaibo. In South America, commercial aviation has a magnificent expansion field, which has one of the largest traffic density lines in the world, Rio de Janeiro–São Paulo, and large airports, such as Congonhas, São Paulo–Guarulhos International and Viracopos (São Paulo), Rio de Janeiro International and Santos Dumont (Rio de Janeiro), El Dorado (Bogotá), Ezeiza (Buenos Aires), Tancredo Neves International Airport (Belo Horizonte), Curitiba International Airport (Curitiba), Brasilia, Caracas, Montevideo, Lima, Viru Viru International Airport (Santa Cruz de la Sierra), Recife, Salvador, Salgado Filho International Airport (Porto Alegre), Fortaleza, Manaus and Belém. The main public transport in major cities is the bus. Many cities also have a diverse system of metro and subway trains, the first of which was the Buenos Aires subte, opened 1913.[232] The Santiago subway[233] is the largest network in South America, with 103 km, while the São Paulo subway is the largest in transportation, with more than 4.6 million passengers per day[234] and was voted the best in the Americas. Rio de Janeiro installed the first railroad of the continent in 1854. Today the city has a vast and diversified system of metropolitan trains, integrated with buses and subway. Recently it was also inaugurated in the city a Light Rail System called VLT, a small electrical trams at low speed, while São Paulo inaugurated its monorail, the first of South America.[citation needed] In Brazil, an express bus system called Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), which operates in several cities, has also been developed. Mi Teleférico, also known as Teleférico La Paz–El Alto (La Paz–El Alto Cable Car), is an aerial cable car urban transit system serving the La Paz–El Alto metropolitan area in Bolivia.

An isolated volcanic island on the South American Plate, Ascension Island is geologically a part of South America, but geopolitically a part of Africa. ^ Occasionally included. An isolated volcanic island near the boundary between the African Plate and the Antarctic Plate, Bouvet Island is biogeographically and geologically associated with Antarctica. Despite being closer to Antarctica and Africa geographically, the United Nations geoscheme has included Bouvet Island in South America instead. ^ Geologically, South Georgia Island and the southernmost portion of mainland South America are both on the Scotia Plate while the South Sandwich Islands is on the nearby Sandwich Plate. Biogeographically and hydrologically, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands is associated with Antarctica. The United Nations geoscheme has included the disputed territory in South America. ^ Except Bouvet Island, which has occasionally been included as a part of South America. ^ Both administered as British Overseas Territories under the Crown, claimed by Argentina. ^ A overseas region/department of France. ^ La Paz is the administrative capital of Bolivia; Sucre is the constitutional and judicial capital of Bolivia. ^ Bouvet Island is commonly associated with Antarctica (due to proximity), but the United Nations geoscheme has included the territory in South America instead.[55] ^ Includes Easter Island in the Pacific Ocean, a Chilean territory frequently reckoned in Oceania. Santiago is the administrative capital of Chile; Valparaíso is the site of legislative meetings. ^ South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands in the South Atlantic Ocean has no permanent population, only hosting a periodic contingent of about 100 researchers and visitors. ^ Continent model: In some parts of the world, for example, Latin America, Latin Europe, and Iran, South America is viewed as a subcontinent of the Americas (a single continent named America).[235] In most of the countries with English as an official language, however, it is considered a continent; see Americas (terminology).

It is one of the largest rainforest organizations in the world, and collaborates with around 70 local and national environmental, indigenous and human rights organizations in 7 rainforest countries in the Amazon region, Central Africa and Southeast Asia.[1] The organization works to support people in securing their rights and increase people's level of commitment to rainforest protection; to prevent policy and business interests from contributing to the destruction of the rainforest; and to consolidate policy and practice that serve to protect it.[2] RFN engages in advocacy work in key international processes concerning rainforest issues. Rainforest Foundation Norway was founded in 1989, and is today one of Europe's leading organizations within the field of rainforest protection.[3] It forms part of the Rainforest Foundation network, with independent sister organizations in the United States and the United Kingdom: the Rainforest Foundation US and the Rainforest Foundation UK. RFN is a foundation, and its operations are funded by public authorities, as well as private donors, international funds and sponsors. Contents 1 History 2 Approach to rainforest protection 3 Programs 4 See also 5 References 6 External links History[edit] Rainforest Foundation Norway was founded in 1989, following the formation of the Rainforest Foundation the same year by Sting and his wife Trudie Styler after the leader of the indigenous Kayapo people of Brazil, Chief Raoni, made a personal request to them that they help his community protect its lands and culture.[4] RFN at that time comprised the Norwegian branch of the international Rainforest Foundation network. In 1996, it became an independent foundation, with five Norwegian member organizations. From the organisation's inception, the executive director was Lars Løvold until March 2018, except from the years 2013-2014 when Dag Hareide was leading the organisation. From March 2018, Øyvind Eggen is the Secretary General. Approach to rainforest protection[edit] Rainforest Foundation Norway espouses a rights-based approach to rainforest protection.[5] Its approach is founded on the notion that the peoples who for generations have developed their cultures and societies in balanced interaction with the highly complex yet vulnerable ecosystems of the rainforest have fundamental rights to these areas.[6] In order to attain its goal of implementing rights-based rainforest management in significant rainforest areas in all 12 countries where RFN and its partners are active, RFN supports programs and projects in cooperation with local organizations, indigenous peoples, and traditional populations of the rainforest. It also seeks changes in the policies and practices of governments, intergovernmental bodies, and private enterprises; and to generate and strengthen national and international public awareness and action.[5] In addition, the organization has adopted an approach that emphasizes the strengthening of civil society as an important goal in the countries in which it is active. On this basis, it has prioritized building long-term partnerships with local and national organizations that share its key objectives, as well as supporting the development of representative indigenous associations and community-based organizations.[5] Programs[edit] With its goal of preserving the rainforest, Rainforest Foundation Norway advocates for the rights of its indigenous inhabitants, by providing project-related grants, capacity-building expertise and direct technical assistance to its local partners on the ground, including indigenous communities and grassroots organizations. In addition to working with these groups directly through program activities in local communities, RFN support them indirectly through policy, advocacy, and information activities aimed at securing rights, establishing indigenous territories and protecting the rainforest.[5] See also[edit] The Rainforest Foundation Fund The Rainforest Foundation US Environmental problems caused by deforestation Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation Self-determination Traditional Ecological Knowledge Sustainable development Indigenous land rights Indigenous peoples of the tropical rainforest Deforestation of the Amazon Rainforest Environmental Movement References[edit] ^ ""About Rainforest Foundation Norway"".

Apart from the British Indian Ocean Territory and two out of 26 atolls of Maldives in South Asia, Southeast Asia is the only other subregion of Asia that lies partly within the Southern Hemisphere. The majority of the subregion is still in the Northern Hemisphere. East Timor and the southern portion of Indonesia are the only parts that are south of the Equator. In contemporary definition, Southeast Asia consists of two geographic regions: Mainland Southeast Asia, also known as the Indochinese Peninsula and historically as Indochina, comprising Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Peninsular Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. Maritime Southeast Asia, also known as the Malay Archipelago and historically as Nusantara, comprising the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (India), Brunei, East Malaysia, East Timor, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Singapore.[6] The region lies near the intersection of geological plates, with both heavy seismic and volcanic activities. The Sunda Plate is the main plate of the region, featuring almost all Southeast Asian countries except Myanmar, northern Thailand, northern Laos, northern Vietnam, and northern Luzon of the Philippines. The mountain ranges in Myanmar, Thailand, and Peninsular Malaysia are part of the Alpide belt, while the islands of the Philippines are part of the Pacific Ring of Fire. Both seismic belts meet in Indonesia, causing the region to have relatively high occurrences of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.[7] It covers about 4,500,000 km2 (1,700,000 sq mi), which is 10.5% of Asia or 3% of Earth's total land area. Its total population is more than 655 million, about 8.5% of the world's population. It is the third most populous geographical region in Asia after South Asia and East Asia.[8] The region is culturally and ethnically diverse, with hundreds of languages spoken by different ethnic groups.[9] Ten countries in the region are members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), a regional organization established for economic, political, military, educational and cultural integration amongst its members.[10] Contents 1 Definitions 1.1 Political divisions 1.1.1 Sovereign states 1.2 Geographical divisions 2 History 2.1 Prehistory 2.2 Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms era 2.3 Spread of Islam 2.4 Trade and colonisation 2.4.1 Chinese 2.4.2 European 2.4.3 Japanese 2.4.4 Indian 2.4.5 American 2.5 Contemporary history 3 Geography 3.1 Boundaries 3.2 Climate 3.3 Environment 4 Economy 5 Demographics 5.1 Ethnic groups 5.2 Religion 5.3 Languages 5.4 Cities 6 Culture 6.1 Influences 6.2 Arts 6.2.1 Music 6.2.2 Writing 7 See also 8 Notes 9 References 9.1 Citations 10 Further reading 11 External links Definitions[edit] States and regions of Southeast Asia The region, together with part of South Asia, was well known by Europeans as the East Indies or simply the Indies until the 20th century. Chinese sources referred the region as Nanyang (""南洋""), which literally means the ""Southern Ocean"". The mainland section of Southeast Asia was referred to as Indochina by European geographers due to its location between China and the Indian subcontinent and its having cultural influences from both neighboring regions. In the 20th century, however, the term became more restricted to territories of the former French Indochina (Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam). The maritime section of Southeast Asia is also known as the Malay Archipelago, a term derived from the European concept of a Malay race.[11] Another term for Maritime Southeast Asia is Insulindia (Indian Islands), used to describe the region between Indochina and Australasia.[12] The term ""Southeast Asia"" was first used in 1839 by American pastor Howard Malcolm in his book Travels in South-Eastern Asia. Malcolm only included the Mainland section and excluded the Maritime section in his definition of Southeast Asia.[13] The term was officially used in the midst of World War II by the Allies, through the formation of South East Asia Command (SEAC) in 1943.[14] SEAC popularised the use of the term ""Southeast Asia,"" although what constituted Southeast Asia was not fixed; for example, SEAC excluded the Philippines and a large part of Indonesia while including Ceylon. However, by the late 1970s, a roughly standard usage of the term ""Southeast Asia"" and the territories it encompasses had emerged.[15] Although from a cultural or linguistic perspective the definitions of ""Southeast Asia"" may vary, the most common definitions nowadays include the area represented by the countries (sovereign states and dependent territories) listed below. This conglomeration of countries is based upon the regions of general proximity formerly controlled or dominated by the Western colonial powers of Great Britain, France, Holland, Spain and the U.S. It bears no universal commonality in culture, language, religion, ethnicity, or system of government. Ten of the eleven states of Southeast Asia are members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), while East Timor is an observer state. Papua New Guinea has stated that it might join ASEAN, and is currently an observer. Sovereignty issues exist over some islands in the South China Sea.

The UN Statistics Division for Asia are based on convenience rather than implying any assumption regarding political or other affiliation of countries or territories:[28]   Central Asia   East Asia   North Asia   South Asia   Southeast Asia   West Asia Political map of Southeast Asia Geographical divisions[edit] Southeast Asia is geographically divided into two subregions, namely Mainland Southeast Asia (or the Indochinese Peninsula) and Maritime Southeast Asia (or the similarly defined Malay Archipelago) (Javanese: Nusantara). Mainland Southeast Asia includes: Cambodia Laos Myanmar (Burma) Peninsular Malaysia Thailand Vietnam Maritime Southeast Asia includes: Brunei East Malaysia East Timor Indonesia Philippines Singapore Although Peninsular Malaysia geographically situated in Mainland Southeast Asia, it also shares many similar cultural and ecological affinities with surrounding islands, thus it serves as a bridge of two subregions.[29] Geographically, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands of India is also considered a part of Maritime Southeast Asia. Eastern Bangladesh and Northeast India have strong cultural ties with Mainland Southeast Asia and are sometimes considered transregional areas between South Asia and Southeast Asia.[30] Similarly, Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands have strong cultural ties with Maritime Southeast Asia and are sometimes considered transregional areas between Southeast Asia and Australia/Oceania. On some occasions, Sri Lanka has been considered a part of Southeast Asia because of its cultural and religious ties to Mainland Southeast Asia.[15][31] The eastern half of the island of New Guinea, which is not a part of Indonesia, namely, Papua New Guinea, is sometimes included as a part of Maritime Southeast Asia, and so are Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Palau, which were all parts of the Spanish East Indies with strong cultural and linguistic ties to the region, specifically, the Philippines.[32] East Timor and the eastern half of Indonesia (east of the Wallace Line in the region of Wallacea) are considered to be geographically associated with Oceania due to their distinctive faunal features. Geologically, the island of New Guinea and its surrounding islands are considered as parts of the Australian continent, connected via the Sahul Shelf. Both Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands are located on the Australian Plate, south of the Java Trench. Even though they are geographically closer to Maritime Southeast Asia than mainland Australia, these two Australian external territories are not geologically associated with Asia as none of them is actually on the Sunda Plate. The United Nations geoscheme has classified both island territories as parts of Oceania, under the Australia and New Zealand (Australasia) subregion.

The Austronesian expansion In the late Neolithic, the Austronesian peoples, who form the majority of the modern population in Brunei, Indonesia, East Timor, Malaysia, and the Philippines, migrated to Southeast Asia from Taiwan in the first seaborne human migration known as the Austronesian Expansion. They arrived in the northern Philippines in 2200 BC and rapidly spread further into the Northern Mariana Islands and Borneo by 1500 BC; Island Melanesia by 1300 BC; and to the rest of Indonesia, Malaysia, southern Vietnam, and Palau by 1000 BC.[38][39] They often settled along coastal areas, assimilating the preexisting Australo-Melanesian peoples such as Orang Asli of peninsular Malaysia, Negritos of the Philippines, and Papuans of New Guinea.[40][41] The Austronesian peoples of Southeast Asia have been seafarers for thousands of years. They spread eastwards to Micronesia and Polynesia, as well as westwards to Madagascar, becoming the ancestors of modern-day Malagasy people, Micronesians, Melanesians, and Polynesians.[42] Passage through the Indian Ocean aided the colonisation of Madagascar, as well as commerce between Western Asia, eastern coast of India and Chinese southern coast.[42] Gold from Sumatra is thought to have reached as far west as Rome. Pliny the Elder wrote in his Natural History about Chryse and Argyre, two legendary islands rich in gold and silver, located in the Indian Ocean. Their vessels, such as the vinta, were capable to sail across the ocean. Magellan's voyage records how much more maneuverable their vessels were, as compared to the European ships.[43] A slave from the Sulu Sea was believed to have been used in Magellan's voyage as a translator. Studies presented by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) through genetic studies of the various peoples of Asia show empirically that there was a single migration event from Africa, whereby the early people travelled along the south coast of Asia, first entered the Malay peninsula 50,000–90,000 years ago. The Orang Asli, in particular the Semang who show Negrito characteristics, are the direct descendants of these earliest settlers of Southeast Asia. These early people diversified and travelled slowly northwards to China, and the populations of Southeast Asia show greater genetic diversity than the younger population of China.[44][45] Solheim and others have shown evidence for a Nusantao maritime trading network ranging from Vietnam to the rest of the archipelago as early as 5000 BC to 1 AD.[46] The Bronze Age Dong Son culture flourished in Northern Vietnam from about 1000 BC to 1 BC. Its influence spread to other parts Southeast Asia.[47][48][49] The region entered the Iron Age era in 500 BC, when iron was forged also in northern Vietnam still under Dong Son, due to its frequent interactions with neighboring China.[33] Bronze drum from Sông Đà, northern Vietnam. Mid-1st millennium BC Most Southeast Asian people were originally animist, engaged in ancestors, nature, and spirits worship. These belief systems were later supplanted by Hinduism and Buddhism after the region, especially coastal areas, came under contact with Indian subcontinent during the 1st century.[50] Indian Brahmins and traders brought Hinduism to the region and made contacts with local courts.[51] Local rulers converted to Hinduism or Buddhism and adopted Indian religious traditions to reinforce their legitimacy, elevate ritual status above their fellow chief counterparts and facilitate trade with South Asian states. They periodically invited Indian Brahmins into their realms and began a gradual process of Indianisation in the region.[52][53][54] Shaivism was the dominant religious tradition of many southern Indian Hindu kingdoms during the 1st century. It then spread into Southeast Asia via Bay of Bengal, Indochina, then Malay Archipelago, leading to thousands of Shiva temples on the islands of Indonesia as well as Cambodia and Vietnam, co-evolving with Buddhism in the region.[55][56] Theravada Buddhism entered the region during the 3rd century, via maritime trade routes between the region and Sri Lanka.[57] Buddhism later established a strong presence in Funan region in the 5th century. In present-day mainland Southeast Asia, Theravada is still the dominant branch of Buddhism, practiced by the Thai, Burmese, and Cambodian Buddhists. This branch was fused with the Hindu-influenced Khmer culture. Mahayana Buddhism established presence in Maritime Southeast Asia, brought by Chinese monks during their transit in the region en route to Nalanda.[52] It is still the dominant branch of Buddhism practiced by Indonesian and Malaysian Buddhists. The spread of these two Indian religions confined the adherents of Southeast Asian indigenous beliefs into remote inland areas. Maluku Islands and New Guinea were never Indianised and its native people were predominantly animists until the 15th century when Islam began to spread in those areas.[58] While in Vietnam, Buddhism never managed to develop strong institutional networks due to strong Chinese influence.[59] In present-day Southeast Asia, Vietnam is the only country where its folk religion makes up the plurality.[60][61] Recently, Vietnamese folk religion is undergoing a revival with the support of the government.[62] Elsewhere, there are ethnic groups in Southeast Asia that resisted conversion and still retain their original animist beliefs, such as the Dayaks in Kalimantan, the Igorots in Luzon, and the Shans in eastern Myanmar.[63] Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms era[edit] Main articles: Greater India and History of Indian influence on Southeast Asia Spread of Hinduism from South Asia to Southeast Asia After the region came under contact with the Indian subcontinent circa 400 BCE, it began a gradual process of Indianisation where Indian ideas such as religions, cultures, architectures, and political administrations were brought by traders and religious figures and adopted by local rulers. In turn, Indian Brahmins and monks were invited by local rulers to live in their realms and help transforming local polities to become more Indianised, blending Indian and indigenous traditions.[64][53][54] Sanskrit and Pali became the elite language of the region, which effectively made Southeast Asia part of the Indosphere.[65] Most of the region had been Indianised during the first centuries, while the Philippines later Indianised circa 9th century when Kingdom of Tondo was established in Luzon.[66] Vietnam, especially its northern part, was never fully Indianised due to the many periods of Chinese domination it experienced.[67] The first Indian-influenced polities established in the region were the Pyu city-states that already existed circa 2nd century BCE, located in inland Myanmar. It served as an overland trading hub between India and China.[68] Theravada Buddhism was the predominant religion of these city states, while the presence of other Indian religions such as Mahayana Buddhism and Hinduism were also widespread.[69][70] In the 1st century, the Funan states centered in Mekong Delta were established, encompassed modern-day Cambodia, southern Vietnam, Laos, and eastern Thailand. It became the dominant trading power in mainland Southeast Asia for about five centuries, provided passage for Indian and Chinese goods and assumed authority over the flow of commerce through Southeast Asia.[42] In maritime Southeast Asia, the first recorded Indianised kingdom was Salakanagara, established in western Java circa 2nd century CE. This Hindu kingdom was known by the Greeks as Argyre (Land of Silver).[71] Borobudur temple in Central Java, Indonesia By the 5th century CE, trade networking between East and West was concentrated in the maritime route. Foreign traders were starting to use new routes such as Malacca and Sunda Strait due to the development of maritime Southeast Asia. This change resulted in the decline of Funan, while new maritime powers such as Srivijaya, Tarumanagara, and Medang emerged. Srivijaya especially became the dominant maritime power for more than 5 centuries, controlling both Strait of Malacca and Sunda Strait.[42] This dominance started to decline when Srivijaya were invaded by Chola Empire, a dominant maritime power of Indian subcontinent, in 1025.[72] The invasion reshaped power and trade in the region, resulted in the rise of new regional powers such as the Khmer Empire and Kahuripan.[73] Continued commercial contacts with the Chinese Empire enabled the Cholas to influence the local cultures. Many of the surviving examples of the Hindu cultural influence found today throughout Southeast Asia are the result of the Chola expeditions.[note 2] Angkor Wat in Siem Reap, Cambodia As Srivijaya influence in the region declined, The Hindu Khmer Empire experienced a golden age during the 11th to 13th century CE. The empire's capital Angkor hosts majestic monuments—such as Angkor Wat and Bayon. Satellite imaging has revealed that Angkor, during its peak, was the largest pre-industrial urban centre in the world.[75] The Champa civilisation was located in what is today central Vietnam, and was a highly Indianised Hindu Kingdom. The Vietnamese launched a massive conquest against the Cham people during the 1471 Vietnamese invasion of Champa, ransacking and burning Champa, slaughtering thousands of Cham people, and forcibly assimilating them into Vietnamese culture.[76] During the 13th century CE, the region experienced Mongol invasions, affected areas such as Vietnamese coast, inland Burma and Java. In 1258, 1285 and 1287, the Mongols tried to invade Đại Việt and Champa.[77] The invasions were unsuccessful, yet both Dai Viet and Champa agreed to become tributary states to Yuan dynasty to avoid further conflicts.[78] The Mongols also invaded Pagan Kingdom in Burma from 1277 to 1287, resulted in fragmentation of the Kingdom and rise of smaller Shan States ruled by local chieftains nominally submitted to Yuan dynasty.[79][80] However, in 1297, a new local power emerged. Myinsaing Kingdom became the real ruler of Central Burma and challenged the Mongol rule. This resulted in the second Mongol invasion of Burma in 1300, which was repulsed by Myinsaing.[81][82] The Mongols would later in 1303 withdrawn from Burma.[83] In 1292, The Mongols sent envoys to Singhasari Kingdom in Java to ask for submission to Mongol rule. Singhasari rejected the proposal and injured the envoys, enraged the Mongols and made them sent a large invasion fleet to Java. Unbeknownst to them, Singhasari collapsed in 1293 due to a revolt by Kadiri, one of its vassals. When the Mongols arrived in Java, a local prince named Raden Wijaya offered his service to assist the Mongols in punishing Kadiri. After Kadiri was defeated, Wijaya turned on his Mongol allies, ambushed their invasion fleet and forced them to immediately leave Java.[84][85] After the departure of the Mongols, Wijaya established the Majapahit Empire in eastern Java in 1293. Majapahit would soon grow into a regional power. Its greatest ruler was Hayam Wuruk, whose reign from 1350 to 1389 marked the empire's peak when other kingdoms in the southern Malay Peninsula, Borneo, Sumatra, and Bali came under its influence. Various sources such as the Nagarakertagama also mention that its influence spanned over parts of Sulawesi, Maluku, and some areas of western New Guinea and southern Philippines, making it one of the largest empire to ever exist in Southeast Asian history.[86](p107) By the 15th century CE however, Majapahit's influence began to wane due to many war of successions it experienced and the rise of new Islamic states such as Samudera Pasai and Malacca Sultanate around the strategic Strait of Malacca. Majapahit then collapsed around 1500. It was the last major Hindu kingdom and the last regional power in the region before the arrival of the Europeans.[87][88] Spread of Islam[edit] Main articles: Spread of Islam in Southeast Asia and Islam in Southeast Asia Wapauwe Old Mosque is the oldest surviving mosque in Indonesia, and the second oldest in Southeast Asia, built in 1414 Islam began to make contacts with Southeast Asia in the 8th-century CE, when the Umayyads established trade with the region via sea routes.[89][90][91] However its spread into the region happened centuries later. In the 11th century, a turbulent period occurred in the history of Maritime Southeast Asia. The Indian Chola navy crossed the ocean and attacked the Srivijaya kingdom of Sangrama Vijayatungavarman in Kadaram (Kedah); the capital of the powerful maritime kingdom was sacked and the king was taken captive. Along with Kadaram, Pannai in present-day Sumatra and Malaiyur and the Malayan peninsula were attacked too. Soon after that, the king of Kedah Phra Ong Mahawangsa became the first ruler to abandon the traditional Hindu faith, and converted to Islam with the Sultanate of Kedah established in 1136. Samudera Pasai converted to Islam in 1267, the King of Malacca Parameswara married the princess of Pasai, and the son became the first sultan of Malacca. Soon, Malacca became the center of Islamic study and maritime trade, and other rulers followed suit. Indonesian religious leader and Islamic scholar Hamka (1908–1981) wrote in 1961: ""The development of Islam in Indonesia and Malaya is intimately related to a Chinese Muslim, Admiral Zheng He.""[92] There are several theories to the Islamization process in Southeast Asia. Another theory is trade. The expansion of trade among West Asia, India and Southeast Asia helped the spread of the religion as Muslim traders from Southern Yemen (Hadramout) brought Islam to the region with their large volume of trade. Many settled in Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia. This is evident in the Arab-Indonesian, Arab-Singaporean, and Arab-Malay populations who were at one time very prominent in each of their countries. Finally, the ruling classes embraced Islam and that further aided the permeation of the religion throughout the region. The ruler of the region's most important port, Malacca Sultanate, embraced Islam in the 15th century, heralding a period of accelerated conversion of Islam throughout the region as Islam provided a positive force among the ruling and trading classes. Gujarati Muslims played a pivotal role in establishing Islam in Southeast Asia.[93] Trade and colonisation[edit] Strait of Malacca Trade among Southeast Asian countries has a long tradition. The consequences of colonial rule, struggle for independence, and in some cases war influenced the economic attitudes and policies of each country.[94] Chinese[edit] See also: List of tributaries of Imperial China and Chinese Empire From 111 BC to 938 AD northern Vietnam was under Chinese rule. Vietnam was successfully governed by a series of Chinese dynasties including the Han, Eastern Han, Eastern Wu, Cao Wei, Jin, Liu Song, Southern Qi, Liang, Sui, Tang, and Southern Han. Records from Magellan's voyage show that Brunei possessed more cannon than European ships, so the Chinese must have been trading with them.[43] Malaysian legend has it that a Chinese Ming emperor sent a princess, Hang Li Po, to Malacca, with a retinue of 500, to marry Sultan Mansur Shah after the emperor was impressed by the wisdom of the sultan. Han Li Po's well (constructed 1459) is now a tourist attraction there, as is Bukit Cina, where her retinue settled. The strategic value of the Strait of Malacca, which was controlled by Sultanate of Malacca in the 15th and early 16th century, did not go unnoticed by Portuguese writer Duarte Barbosa, who in 1500 wrote: ""He who is lord of Malacca has his hand on the throat of Venice"". Colonial boundaries in Southeast Asia European[edit] See also: European colonisation of Southeast Asia Fort Cornwallis in George Town marks the spot where the British East India Company first landed in Penang in 1786, thus heralding the British colonisation of Malaya Western influence started to enter in the 16th century, with the arrival of the Portuguese in Malacca, Maluku and the Philippines, the latter being settled by the Spanish years later. Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries the Dutch established the Dutch East Indies; the French Indochina; and the British Strait Settlements. By the 19th century, all Southeast Asian countries were colonised except for Thailand. Duit, a coin minted by the VOC, 1646–1667. 2 kas, 2 duit European explorers were reaching Southeast Asia from the west and from the east. Regular trade between the ships sailing east from the Indian Ocean and south from mainland Asia provided goods in return for natural products, such as honey and hornbill beaks from the islands of the archipelago. Before the eighteenth and nineteenth century, the Europeans mostly were interested in expanding trade links. For the majority of the populations in each country, there was comparatively little interaction with Europeans and traditional social routines and relationships continued. For most, a life with subsistence-level agriculture, fishing and, in less developed civilizations, hunting and gathering was still hard.[95] Europeans brought Christianity allowing Christian missionaries to become widespread. Thailand also allowed Western scientists to enter its country to develop its own education system as well as start sending Royal members and Thai scholars to get higher education from Europe and Russia. Japanese[edit] See also: Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, Empire of Japan, and Japanese war crimes During World War II, Imperial Japan invaded most of the former western colonies. The Shōwa occupation regime committed violent actions against civilians such as the Manila massacre and the implementation of a system of forced labour, such as the one involving 4 to 10 million romusha in Indonesia.[96] A later UN report stated that four million people died in Indonesia as a result of famine and forced labour during the Japanese occupation.[97] The Allied powers who defeated Japan in the South-East Asian theatre of World War II then contended with nationalists to whom the occupation authorities had granted independence. Indian[edit] Gujarat, India had a flourishing trade relationship with Southeast Asia in the 15th and 16th centuries.[93] The trade relationship with Gujarat declined after the Portuguese invasion of Southeast Asia in the 17th century.[93] American[edit] See also: American Philippines The United States took the Philippines from Spain in 1898. Internal autonomy was granted in 1934, and independence in 1946.[98] Contemporary history[edit] Most countries in the region enjoy national autonomy. Democratic forms of government and the recognition of human rights are taking root. ASEAN provides a framework for the integration of commerce and regional responses to international concerns. China has asserted broad claims over the South China Sea, based on its nine-dash line, and has built artificial islands in an attempt to bolster its claims. China also has asserted an exclusive economic zone based on the Spratly Islands. The Philippines challenged China in the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague in 2013, and in Philippines v. China (2016), the Court ruled in favor of the Philippines and rejected China's claims.[99][100] Geography[edit] See also: Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia), List of Southeast Asian mountains, and Zomia (geography) Relief map of Southeast Asia Indonesia is the largest country in Southeast Asia and is also the largest archipelago in the world by size (according to the CIA World Factbook). Geologically, the Indonesian Archipelago is one of the most volcanically active regions in the world. Geological uplifts in the region have also produced some impressive mountains, culminating in Puncak Jaya in Papua, Indonesia at 5,030 metres (16,503 feet), on the island of New Guinea; it is the only place where ice glaciers can be found in Southeast Asia. The highest mountain in Southeast Asia is Hkakabo Razi at 5,967 metres (19,577 feet) and can be found in northern Burma sharing the same range of its parent peak, Mount Everest. The South China Sea is the major body of water within Southeast Asia. The Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia, and Singapore, have integral rivers that flow into the South China Sea. Mayon Volcano, despite being dangerously active, holds the record of the world's most perfect cone which is built from past and continuous eruption.[101] Boundaries[edit] Further information: Boundaries between the continents of Earth Geographically, Southeast Asia is bounded to the southeast by the Australian continent, the boundary between these two regions runs through Wallacea. Geopolitically, the boundary lies between Papua New Guinea and the Indonesian region of Western New Guinea (Papua and West Papua). Both countries share the island of New Guinea. Climate[edit] Southeast Asia map of Köppen climate classification The climate in Southeast Asia is mainly tropical–hot and humid all year round with plentiful rainfall. Northern Vietnam and the mountainous parts of Laos and Myanmar are the only regions in Southeast Asia that feature a subtropical climate, which have a cooler winter with potential snow. The majority of Southeast Asia has a wet and dry season caused by seasonal shifts in winds or monsoon. The tropical rain belt causes additional rainfall during the monsoon season. The rainforest is the second largest on Earth (with the Amazon rainforest being the largest). An exception to this type of climate and vegetation is the mountain areas in the northern region, where high altitudes lead to milder temperatures and drier landscape. Other parts fall out of this climate because they are desert-like. Southeast Asia is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change in the world.[102][103] Climate change will have a big effect on agriculture in Southeast Asia such as irrigation systems will be affected by changes in rainfall and runoff, and subsequently, water quality and supply.[104] Climate change is also likely to pose a serious threat to the fisheries industry in Southeast Asia.[102] Despite being one of the most vulnerable regions to the effects of climate change in the world, Southeast Asian countries are lagging behind in terms of their climate mitigation measures.[103] Environment[edit] See also: Southeast Asian coral reefs and Wallace Line Komodo dragon in Komodo National Park, Indonesia The vast majority of Southeast Asia falls within the warm, humid tropics, and its climate generally can be characterised as monsoonal. The animals of Southeast Asia are diverse; on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra, the orangutan, the Asian elephant, the Malayan tapir, the Sumatran rhinoceros and the Bornean clouded leopard can also be found. Six subspecies of the binturong or bearcat exist in the region, though the one endemic to the island of Palawan is now classed as vulnerable. Tigers of three different subspecies are found on the island of Sumatra (the Sumatran tiger), in peninsular Malaysia (the Malayan tiger), and in Indochina (the Indochinese tiger); all of which are endangered species. The Komodo dragon is the largest living species of lizard and inhabits the islands of Komodo, Rinca, Flores, and Gili Motang in Indonesia. The Philippine eagle The Philippine eagle is the national bird of the Philippines. It is considered by scientists as the largest eagle in the world,[105] and is endemic to the Philippines' forests. The wild Asian water buffalo, and on various islands related dwarf species of Bubalus such as anoa were once widespread in Southeast Asia; nowadays the domestic Asian water buffalo is common across the region, but its remaining relatives are rare and endangered. The mouse deer, a small tusked deer as large as a toy dog or cat, mostly can be found on Sumatra, Borneo (Indonesia), and in Palawan Islands (Philippines). The gaur, a gigantic wild ox larger than even wild water buffalo, is found mainly in Indochina. There is very little scientific information available regarding Southeast Asian amphibians.[106] Birds such as the green peafowl and drongo live in this subregion as far east as Indonesia. The babirusa, a four-tusked pig, can be found in Indonesia as well. The hornbill was prized for its beak and used in trade with China. The horn of the rhinoceros, not part of its skull, was prized in China as well. The Indonesian Archipelago is split by the Wallace Line. This line runs along what is now known to be a tectonic plate boundary, and separates Asian (Western) species from Australasian (Eastern) species. The islands between Java/Borneo and Papua form a mixed zone, where both types occur, known as Wallacea. As the pace of development accelerates and populations continue to expand in Southeast Asia, concern has increased regarding the impact of human activity on the region's environment. A significant portion of Southeast Asia, however, has not changed greatly and remains an unaltered home to wildlife. The nations of the region, with only a few exceptions, have become aware of the need to maintain forest cover not only to prevent soil erosion but to preserve the diversity of flora and fauna. Indonesia, for example, has created an extensive system of national parks and preserves for this purpose. Even so, such species as the Javan rhinoceros face extinction, with only a handful of the animals remaining in western Java. Wallace's hypothetical line divides Indonesian Archipelago into 2 types of fauna, Australasian and Southeast Asian fauna. The deepwater of the Lombok Strait between the islands of Bali and Lombok formed a water barrier even when lower sea levels linked the now-separated islands and landmasses on either side The shallow waters of the Southeast Asian coral reefs have the highest levels of biodiversity for the world's marine ecosystems, where coral, fish, and molluscs abound. According to Conservation International, marine surveys suggest that the marine life diversity in the Raja Ampat (Indonesia) is the highest recorded on Earth. Diversity is considerably greater than any other area sampled in the Coral Triangle composed of Indonesia, the Philippines, and Papua New Guinea. The Coral Triangle is the heart of the world's coral reef biodiversity, the Verde Passage is dubbed by Conservation International as the world's ""center of the center of marine shorefish biodiversity"". The whale shark, the world's largest species of fish and 6 species of sea turtles can also be found in the South China Sea and the Pacific Ocean territories of the Philippines. The trees and other plants of the region are tropical; in some countries where the mountains are tall enough, temperate-climate vegetation can be found. These rainforest areas are currently being logged-over, especially in Borneo. While Southeast Asia is rich in flora and fauna, Southeast Asia is facing severe deforestation which causes habitat loss for various endangered species such as orangutan and the Sumatran tiger. Predictions have been made that more than 40% of the animal and plant species in Southeast Asia could be wiped out in the 21st century.[107] At the same time, haze has been a regular occurrence. The two worst regional hazes were in 1997 and 2006 in which multiple countries were covered with thick haze, mostly caused by ""slash and burn"" activities in Sumatra and Borneo. In reaction, several countries in Southeast Asia signed the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution to combat haze pollution. The 2013 Southeast Asian Haze saw API levels reach a hazardous level in some countries. Muar experienced the highest API level of 746 on 23 June 2013 at around 7 am.[108] Economy[edit] The Port of Singapore is the busiest transshipment and container port in the world, and is an important transportation and shipping hub in Southeast Asia Even prior to the penetration of European interests, Southeast Asia was a critical part of the world trading system. A wide range of commodities originated in the region, but especially important were spices such as pepper, ginger, cloves, and nutmeg. The spice trade initially was developed by Indian and Arab merchants, but it also brought Europeans to the region. First, Spaniards (Manila galleon) who sailed from the Americas and Kingdom of Portugal, then the Dutch, and finally the British and French became involved in this enterprise in various countries. The penetration of European commercial interests gradually evolved into annexation of territories, as traders lobbied for an extension of control to protect and expand their activities. As a result, the Dutch moved into Indonesia, the British into Malaya and parts of Borneo, the French into Indochina, and the Spanish and the US into the Philippines. An economic effect of this imperialism was the shift in the production of commodities. For example, the rubber plantations of Malaysia, Java, Vietnam, and Cambodia, the tin mining of Malaya, the rice fields of the Mekong Delta in Vietnam, and the Irrawaddy River delta in Burma, were a response to the powerful market demands.[109] The overseas Chinese community has played a large role in the development of the economies in the region. The origins of Chinese influence can be traced to the 16th century, when Chinese migrants from southern China settled in Indonesia, Thailand, and other Southeast Asian countries.[110] Chinese populations in the region saw a rapid increase following the Communist Revolution in 1949, which forced many refugees to emigrate outside of China.[111] The region's economy greatly depends on agriculture; rice and rubber have long been prominent exports. Manufacturing and services are becoming more important.[citation needed] An emerging market, Indonesia is the largest economy in this region. Newly industrialised countries include Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines, while Singapore and Brunei are affluent developed economies. The rest of Southeast Asia is still heavily dependent on agriculture, but Vietnam is notably making steady progress in developing its industrial sectors.[citation needed] The region notably manufactures textiles, electronic high-tech goods such as microprocessors, and heavy industrial products such as automobiles.[citation needed] Oil reserves in Southeast Asia are plentiful.[citation needed] Seventeen telecommunications companies contracted to build the Asia-America Gateway submarine cable to connect Southeast Asia to the US[112] This is to avoid disruption of the kind caused by the cutting of the undersea cable from Taiwan to the US in the 2006 Hengchun earthquakes. Along with its temples Cambodia has been promoting its coastal resorts. Island off Otres Beach Sihanoukville, Cambodia Tourism has been a key factor in economic development for many Southeast Asian countries, especially Cambodia. According to UNESCO, ""tourism, if correctly conceived, can be a tremendous development tool and an effective means of preserving the cultural diversity of our planet.""[113] Since the early 1990s, ""even the non-ASEAN nations such as Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and Burma, where the income derived from tourism is low, are attempting to expand their own tourism industries.""[114] In 1995, Singapore was the regional leader in tourism receipts relative to GDP at over 8%. By 1998, those receipts had dropped to less than 6% of GDP while Thailand and Lao PDR increased receipts to over 7%. Since 2000, Cambodia has surpassed all other ASEAN countries and generated almost 15% of its GDP from tourism in 2006.[115] Furthermore, Vietnam is considered as a rising power in Southeast Asia due to its large foreign investment opportunities and the booming tourism sector, despite only having their trade embargo lifted in 1995. Indonesia is the only member of G-20 major economies and is the largest economy in the region.[116] Indonesia's estimated gross domestic product for 2020 was US$1,088.8 billion (nominal) or $3,328.3 billion (PPP) with per capita GDP of US$4,038 (nominal) or $12,345 (PPP).[117] Stock markets in Southeast Asia have performed better than other bourses in the Asia-Pacific region in 2010, with the Philippines' PSE leading the way with 22 percent growth, followed by Thailand's SET with 21 percent and Indonesia's JKSE with 19 percent.[118][119] Southeast Asia's GDP per capita is US$4,685 according to a 2020 International Monetary Fund estimates, which is comparable to South Africa, Iraq, and Georgia.[120] Country Currency Population(2020)[16][121] Nominal GDP(2020) $ billion[122] GDP per capita(2020)[120] GDP growth(2020)[123] Inflation(2020)[124] Main industries Brunei B$ Brunei dollar 437,479 $10.647 $23,117 0.1% 0.3% Petroleum, Petrochemicals, Fishing Cambodia ៛ Riel 16,718,965 $26.316 $1,572 -2.8% 2.5% Clothing, Gold, Agriculture East Timor US$ US dollar 1,318,445 $1.920 $1,456 -6.8% 0.9% Petroleum, Coffee, Electronics Indonesia Rp Rupiah 270,203,917[121] $1,088.768 $4,038 -1.5% 2.1% Coal, Petroleum, Palm oil Laos ₭ Kip 7,275,560 $18.653 $2,567 0.2% 6.5% Copper, Electronics, Tin Malaysia RM Ringgit 32,365,999 $336.330 $10,192 -6% -1.1% Electronics, Petroleum, Palm oil Myanmar K Kyat 54,409,800 $70.890 $1,333 2% 6.1% Natural gas, Agriculture, Clothing Philippines ₱ Peso 109,581,078 $367.362 $3,373 -8.3% 2.4% Electronics, Timber, Automotive Singapore S$ Singapore dollar 5,850,342 $337.451 $58,484 -6% -0.4% Electronics, Petroleum, Chemicals Thailand ฿ Baht 69,799,978 $509.200 $7,295 -7.1% -0.4% Electronics, Automotive, Rubber Vietnam ₫ Đồng 97,338,579 $340.602 $3,498 2.9% 3.8% Electronics, Clothing, Petroleum Demographics[edit] Population distribution of the countries of Southeast Asia (with Indonesia split into its major islands). Southeast Asia has an area of approximately 4,500,000 square kilometres (1,700,000 sq mi). As of 2018, around 655 million people live in the region, more than a fifth live (143 million) on the Indonesian island of Java, the most densely populated large island in the world. Indonesia is the most populous country with 268 million people, and also the 4th most populous country in the world. The distribution of the religions and people is diverse in Southeast Asia and varies by country. Some 30 million overseas Chinese also live in Southeast Asia, most prominently in Christmas Island, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand, and also as the Hoa in Vietnam. People of Southeast Asian origins are known as Southeast Asians or Aseanites. vte Largest cities in Southeast AsiaDemographia 2020 Rank Name Country Pop. Rank Name Country Pop.

Ethnic mosaic of Southeast Asia The Aslians and Negritos were believed as one of the earliest inhabitants in the region. They are genetically related to the Papuans in Eastern Indonesia, East Timor and Australian Aborigines. In modern times, the Javanese are the largest ethnic group in Southeast Asia, with more than 100 million people, mostly concentrated in Java, Indonesia. The second-largest ethnic group in Southeast Asia is Vietnamese (Kinh people) with around 86 million population, mainly inhabiting in Vietnam, thus forming a significant minority in neighboring Cambodia and Laos. The Thais is also a significant ethnic group with around 59 million population forming the majority in Thailand. In Burma, the Burmese account for more than two-thirds of the ethnic stock in this country, with the Indo-Aryan Rohingya make up a significant minority in Rakhine State. Indonesia is clearly dominated by the Javanese and Sundanese ethnic groups, with hundreds of ethnic minorities inhabited the archipelago, including Madurese, Minangkabau, Bugis, Balinese, Dayak, Batak and Malays. While Malaysia is split between more than half Malays and one-quarter Chinese, and also Indian minority in the West Malaysia however Dayaks make up the majority in Sarawak and Kadazan-dusun makes up the majority in Sabah which are in the East Malaysia. The Malays are the majority in West Malaysia and Brunei, while they forming a significant minority in Indonesia, Southern Thailand, East Malaysia and Singapore. In city-state Singapore, Chinese are the majority, yet the city is a multicultural melting pot with Malays, Indians and Eurasian also called the island their home. The Chams form a significant minority in Central and South Vietnam, also in Central Cambodia. While the Khmers are the majority in Cambodia and form a significant minority in Southern Vietnam and Thailand, the Hmong people are the minority in Vietnam, China, and Laos. Within the Philippines, the Tagalog, Visayan (mainly Cebuanos, Warays and Hiligaynons), Ilocano, Bicolano, Moro (mainly Tausug, Maranao, and Maguindanao) and Central Luzon (mainly Kapampangan and Pangasinan) groups are significant.

Roman Catholic Cathedral-Basilica of the Immaculate Conception, the metropolitan see of the Archbishop of Manila, Philippines. A Protestant church in Indonesia. Indonesia has the largest Protestant population in Southeast Asia. Jewish Surabaya Synagogue in Indonesia, demolished in 2013. Countries in Southeast Asia practice many different religions. By population, Islam is the most practised faith, numbering approximately 240 million adherents, or about 40% of the entire population, concentrated in Indonesia, Brunei, Malaysia, Southern Thailand and in the Southern Philippines. Indonesia is the most populous Muslim-majority country in the world. There are approximately 205 million Buddhists in Southeast Asia, making it the second-largest religion in the region, after Islam. Approximately 38% of the global Buddhist population resides in Southeast Asia. Buddhism is predominant in Vietnam, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar and Singapore. Ancestor worship and Confucianism are also widely practised in Vietnam and Singapore. Christianity is predominant in the Philippines, eastern Indonesia, East Malaysia, and East Timor. The Philippines has the largest Roman Catholic population in Asia.[125] East Timor is also predominantly Roman Catholic due to a history of Indonesian[126] and Portuguese rule. In October 2019, the number of Christians, both Catholic and Protestant in Southeast Asia, reached 156 million, of which 97 million came from the Philippines, 26 million came from Indonesia, 11 million came from Vietnam, and the rest came from Malaysia, Myanmar, East Timor, Singapore, Laos, Cambodia and Brunei. No individual Southeast Asian country is religiously homogeneous. Some groups are protected de facto by their isolation from the rest of the world.[127] In the world's most populous Muslim nation, Indonesia, Hinduism is dominant on islands such as Bali. Christianity also predominates in the rest of the part of the Philippines, New Guinea, Flores and Timor. Pockets of Hindu population can also be found around Southeast Asia in Singapore, Malaysia, etc. Garuda, the phoenix who is the mount (vahanam) of Vishnu, is a national symbol in both Thailand and Indonesia; in the Philippines, gold images of Garuda have been found on Palawan; gold images of other Hindu gods and goddesses have also been found on Mindanao. Balinese Hinduism is somewhat different from Hinduism practised elsewhere, as Animism and local culture is incorporated into it. Christians can also be found throughout Southeast Asia; they are in the majority in East Timor and the Philippines, Asia's largest Christian nation. In addition, there are also older tribal religious practices in remote areas of Sarawak in East Malaysia, Highland Philippines, and Papua in eastern Indonesia. In Burma, Sakka (Indra) is revered as a Nat. In Vietnam, Mahayana Buddhism is practised, which is influenced by native animism but with a strong emphasis on ancestor worship.

While in Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Malaysia the culture is a mix of indigenous Austronesian, Indian, Islamic, Western, and Chinese cultures. Also Brunei shows a strong influence from Arabia. Vietnam and Singapore show more Chinese influence[143] in that Singapore, although being geographically a Southeast Asian nation, is home to a large Chinese majority and Vietnam was in China's sphere of influence for much of its history. Indian influence in Singapore is only evident through the Tamil migrants,[144] which influenced, to some extent, the cuisine of Singapore. Throughout Vietnam's history, it has had no direct influence from India – only through contact with the Thai, Khmer and Cham peoples. Moreover, Vietnam is also categorized under the East Asian cultural sphere along with China, Korea, and Japan due to a large amount of Chinese influence embedded in their culture and lifestyle. Paddy field in Vietnam Rice paddy agriculture has existed in Southeast Asia for millennia, ranging across the subregion. Some dramatic examples of these rice paddies populate the Banaue Rice Terraces in the mountains of Luzon in the Philippines. Maintenance of these paddies is very labour-intensive. The rice paddies are well-suited to the monsoon climate of the region. Stilt houses can be found all over Southeast Asia, from Thailand and Vietnam to Borneo, to Luzon in the Philippines, to Papua New Guinea. The region has diverse metalworking, especially in Indonesia. This includes weaponry, such as the distinctive kris, and musical instruments, such as the gamelan. Influences[edit] The region's chief cultural influences have been from some combination of Islam, India, and China. Diverse cultural influence is pronounced in the Philippines, derived particularly from the period of Spanish and American rule, contact with Indian-influenced cultures, and the Chinese and Japanese trading era. As a rule, the peoples who ate with their fingers were more likely influenced by the culture of India, for example, than the culture of China, where the peoples ate with chopsticks; tea, as a beverage, can be found across the region. The fish sauces distinctive to the region tend to vary. Arts[edit] The Royal Ballet of Cambodia (Paris, France 2010) The arts of Southeast Asia have an affinity with the arts of other areas. Dance in much of Southeast Asia includes movement of the hands as well as the feet, to express the dance's emotion and meaning of the story that the ballerina is going to tell the audience. Most of Southeast Asia introduced dance into their court; in particular, Cambodian royal ballet represented them in the early 7th century before the Khmer Empire, which was highly influenced by Indian Hinduism. Apsara Dance, famous for strong hand and feet movement, is a great example of Hindu symbolic dance. Puppetry and shadow plays were also a favoured form of entertainment in past centuries, a famous one being Wayang from Indonesia. The arts and literature in some of Southeast Asia are quite influenced by Hinduism, which was brought to them centuries ago. Indonesia, despite conversion to Islam which opposes certain forms of art, has retained many forms of Hindu-influenced practices, culture, art, and literature. An example is the Wayang Kulit (Shadow Puppet) and literature like the Ramayana. The wayang kulit show has been recognized by UNESCO on 7 November 2003, as a Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. It has been pointed out that Khmer and Indonesian classical arts were concerned with depicting the life of the gods, but to the Southeast Asian mind, the life of the gods was the life of the peoples themselves—joyous, earthy, yet divine. The Tai, coming late into Southeast Asia, brought with them some Chinese artistic traditions, but they soon shed them in favour of the Khmer and Mon traditions, and the only indications of their earlier contact with Chinese arts were in the style of their temples, especially the tapering roof, and in their lacquerware. Music[edit] Main article: Music of Southeast Asia Angklung as a Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity Traditional music in Southeast Asia is as varied as its many ethnic and cultural divisions. Main styles of traditional music can be seen: Court music, folk music, music styles of smaller ethnic groups, and music influenced by genres outside the geographic region. Of the court and folk genres, Gong chime ensembles and orchestras make up the majority (the exception being lowland areas of Vietnam). Gamelan and Angklung orchestras from Indonesia, Piphat /Pinpeat ensembles of Thailand and Cambodia and the Kulintang ensembles of the southern Philippines, Borneo, Sulawesi and Timor are the three main distinct styles of musical genres that have influenced other traditional musical styles in the region. String instruments also are popular in the region. On 18 November 2010, UNESCO officially recognized angklung as a Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity, and encourage the Indonesian people and government to safeguard, transmit, promote performances and to encourage the craftsmanship of angklung making. Writing[edit] Main articles: Writing systems of Southeast Asia, Baybayin, Jawi script, S.E.A. Write Award, and Thai alphabet Thai manuscript from before the 19th-century writing system The history of Southeast Asia has led to a wealth of different authors, from both within and without writing about the region. Originally, Indians were the ones who taught the native inhabitants about writing. This is shown through Brahmic forms of writing present in the region such as the Balinese script shown on split palm leaf called lontar (see image to the left — magnify the image to see the writing on the flat side, and the decoration on the reverse side). Sign in Balinese and Latin script at a Hindu temple in Bali The antiquity of this form of writing extends before the invention of paper around the year 100 in China. Note each palm leaf section was only several lines, written longitudinally across the leaf, and bound by twine to the other sections. The outer portion was decorated. The alphabets of Southeast Asia tended to be abugidas, until the arrival of the Europeans, who used words that also ended in consonants, not just vowels. Other forms of official documents, which did not use paper, included Javanese copperplate scrolls. This material would have been more durable than paper in the tropical climate of Southeast Asia. In Malaysia, Brunei, and Singapore, the Malay language is now generally written in the Latin script. The same phenomenon is present in Indonesian, although different spelling standards are utilised (e.g. 'Teksi' in Malay and 'Taksi' in Indonesian for the word 'Taxi'). The use of Chinese characters, in the past and present, is only evident in Vietnam and more recently, Singapore and Malaysia. The adoption of Chinese characters in Vietnam dates back to around 111 B.C. when it was occupied by the Chinese. A Vietnamese script called Chữ Nôm used modified Chinese characters to express the Vietnamese language. Both classical Chinese and Chữ Nôm were used up until the early 20th century. However, the use of the Chinese script has been in decline, especially in Singapore and Malaysia as the younger generations are in favour of the Latin Script.

Angola, Burundi, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Rwanda, and São Tomé and Príncipe are members of the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS).[1] Six of those states (Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon) are also members of the Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa (CEMAC) and share a common currency, the Central African CFA franc.[2] The African Development Bank defines Central Africa as Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon.[3] Middle Africa is an analogous term used by the United Nations in its geoscheme for Africa. It includes the same countries as the African Development Bank's definition, along with Angola, and São Tomé and Príncipe.[4] Contents 1 List of Central African countries 2 Background 3 Geography 4 History 4.1 Prehistory 4.2 Ancient history 4.2.1 Sao civilization 4.3 Kanem Empire 4.4 Bornu Empire 4.5 Shilluk Kingdom 4.6 Baguirmi Kingdom 4.7 Wadai Empire 4.8 Lunda Empire 4.9 Kongo Kingdom 4.10 Modern history 5 Economy 6 Demographics 7 Culture 7.1 Art 7.2 Architecture 7.3 Clothing 7.4 Cuisine 7.5 Music 7.6 Religion 7.7 Film industry 8 Science and technology 9 See also 10 References 11 External links List of Central African countries[edit] Region Country Central Africa Angola Cameroon Central African Republic Chad Democratic Republic of the Congo Republic of the Congo Equatorial Guinea Gabon São Tomé and Príncipe ( Rwanda ) Background[edit] Membership of ECCAS The Central African Federation (1953–1963), also called the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, was made up of what are now the nations of Malawi, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Similarly, the Anglican Church of the Province of Central Africa covers dioceses in Botswana, Malawi, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, while the Church of Central Africa, Presbyterian has synods in Malawi, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. These states are now typically considered part of East or Southern Africa.[5] Geography[edit] Congo Basin The basin of Lake Chad has historically been ecologically significant to the populations of Central Africa, especially with the Lake Chad Basin Commission serving as an important supra-regional organization in Central Africa. History[edit] Further information: Archaeology of Central Africa, History of Africa § Central Africa, and Sub-Saharan Africa § Central Africa Prehistory[edit] Archeological finds in Central Africa have been discovered dating back, over 100,000 years.[6] According to Zagato and Holl, there is evidence of iron-smelting in the Central African Republic and Cameroon that may date back to 3000 to 2500 BCE.[7] Extensive walled settlements have recently been found in Northeast Nigeria, approximately 60 km (37 mi) southwest of Lake Chad dating to the first millennium BCE.[8][9] Trade and improved agricultural techniques supported more sophisticated societies, leading to the early civilizations of Sao, Kanem, Bornu, Shilluk, Baguirmi, and Wadai.[10] Around 2500 BCE, Bantu migrants had reached the Great Lakes Region in Central Africa. Halfway through the first millennium BCE, the Bantu had also settled as far south as what is now Angola. Ancient history[edit] Sao civilization[edit] Main article: Sao civilization The Sao civilization flourished from ca. the 6th century BCE to as late as the 16th century CE in northern Central Africa. The Sao lived by the Chari River south of Lake Chad in territory that later became part of Cameroon and Chad. They are the earliest people to have left clear traces of their presence in the territory of modern Cameroon. Today, several ethnic groups of northern Cameroon and southern Chad but particularly the Sara people claim descent from the civilization of the Sao. Sao artifacts show that they were skilled workers in bronze, copper, and iron.[11] Finds include bronze sculptures and terra cotta statues of human and animal figures, coins, funerary urns, household utensils, jewelry, highly decorated pottery, and spears.[12] The largest Sao archaeological finds have been made south of Lake Chad. Kanem Empire[edit] The Kanem and Bornu Empires in 1810 Main article: Kanem Empire The Kanem–Bornu Empire was centered in the Chad Basin. It was known as the Kanem Empire from the 9th century CE onward and lasted as the independent kingdom of Bornu until 1900. At its height it encompassed an area covering not only much of Chad, but also parts of modern southern Libya, eastern Niger, northeastern Nigeria, northern Cameroon, parts of South Sudan and the Central African Republic. The history of the Empire is mainly known from the Royal Chronicle or Girgam discovered in 1851 by the German traveler Heinrich Barth.[13] Kanem rose in the 8th century in the region to the north and east of Lake Chad. The Kanem empire went into decline, shrank, and in the 14th century was defeated by Bilala invaders from the Lake Fitri region. [14] Bornu Empire[edit] Main article: Bornu Empire The Kanuri people led by the Sayfuwa migrated to the west and south of the lake, where they established the Bornu Empire. By the late 16th century the Bornu empire had expanded and recaptured the parts of Kanem that had been conquered by the Bulala. [15] satellite states of Bornu included the Damagaram in the west and Baguirmi to the southeast of Lake Chad. Shilluk Kingdom[edit] Main article: Shilluk Kingdom The Shilluk Kingdom was centered in South Sudan from the 15th century from along a strip of land along the western bank of White Nile, from Lake No to about 12° north latitude. The capital and royal residence were in the town of Fashoda. The kingdom was founded during the mid-fifteenth century CE by its first ruler, Nyikang. During the nineteenth century, the Shilluk Kingdom faced decline following military assaults from the Ottoman Empire and later British and Sudanese colonization in Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. Baguirmi Kingdom[edit] Main article: Baguirmi Kingdom The Kingdom of Baguirmi existed as an independent state during the 16th and 17th centuries southeast of Lake Chad in what is now the country of Chad. Baguirmi emerged to the southeast of the Kanem–Bornu Empire. The kingdom's first ruler was Mbang Birni Besse. Later in his reign, the Bornu Empire conquered and made the state a tributary. Wadai Empire[edit] Abéché, capital of Wadai, in 1918 after the French had taken over Main article: Wadai Empire The Wadai Empire was centered on Chad and the Central African Republic from the 17th century. The Tunjur people founded the Wadai Kingdom to the east of Bornu in the 16th century. In the 17th century, there was a revolt of the Maba people who established a Muslim dynasty. At first, Wadai paid tribute to Bornu and Durfur, but by the 18th century, Wadai was fully independent and had become an aggressor against its neighbors.[10] Lunda Empire[edit] Main article: Lunda Empire Further information: List of Rulers of the Lunda Empire Lunda town and dwelling Following the Bantu Migration from Western Africa, Bantu kingdoms and empires began to develop in southern Central Africa. In the 1450s, a Luba from the royal family Ilunga Tshibinda married Lunda queen Rweej and united all Lunda peoples. Their son Mulopwe Luseeng expanded the kingdom. His son Naweej expanded the empire further and is known as the first Lunda emperor, with the title Mwata Yamvo (mwaant yaav, mwant yav), the ""Lord of Vipers"". The Luba political system was retained, and conquered peoples were integrated into the system. The mwata yamvo assigned a cilool or kilolo (royal adviser) and tax collector to each state conquered.[16][17] Numerous states claimed descent from the Lunda. The Imbangala of inland Angola claimed descent from a founder, Kinguri, brother of Queen Rweej, who could not tolerate the rule of mulopwe Tshibunda. Kinguri became the title of kings of states founded by Queen Rweej's brother. The Luena (Lwena) and Lozi (Luyani) in Zambia also claim descent from Kinguri. During the 17th century, a Lunda chief and warrior called Mwata Kazembe set up an Eastern Lunda kingdom in the valley of the Luapula River. The Lunda's western expansion also saw claims of descent by the Yaka and the Pende. The Lunda linked Central Africa with the western coast trade. The kingdom of Lunda came to an end in the 19th century when it was invaded by the Chokwe, who were armed with guns.[17][18] Kongo Kingdom[edit] Main article: Kingdom of Kongo Further information: List of rulers of Kongo Kongo in 1711 By the 15th century CE, the farming Bakongo people (ba being the plural prefix) were unified as the Kingdom of Kongo under a ruler called the manikongo, residing in the fertile Pool Malebo area on the lower Congo River. The capital was M'banza-Kongo. With superior organization, they were able to conquer their neighbors and extract tribute. They were experts in metalwork, pottery, and weaving raffia cloth. They stimulated interregional trade via a tribute system controlled by the manikongo. Later, maize (corn) and cassava (manioc) would be introduced to the region via trade with the Portuguese at their ports at Luanda and Benguela. The maize and cassava would result in population growth in the region and other parts of Africa, replacing millet as the main staple. By the 16th century, the manikongo held authority from the Atlantic in the west to the Kwango River in the east. Each territory was assigned a mani-mpembe (provincial governor) by the manikongo. In 1506, Afonso I (1506–1542), a Christian, took over the throne. Slave trading increased with Afonso's wars of conquest. About 1568 to 1569, the Jaga invaded Kongo, laying waste to the kingdom and forcing the manikongo into exile. In 1574, Manikongo Álvaro I was reinstated with the help of Portuguese mercenaries. During the latter part of the 1660s, the Portuguese tried to gain control of Kongo. Manikongo António I (1661–1665), with a Kongolese army of 5,000, was destroyed by an army of Afro-Portuguese at the Battle of Mbwila. The empire dissolved into petty polities, fighting among each other for war captives to sell into slavery.[19][20][21] Kongo gained captives from the Kingdom of Ndongo in wars of conquest. Ndongo was ruled by the ngola. Ndongo would also engage in slave trading with the Portuguese, with São Tomé being a transit point to Brazil. The kingdom was not as welcoming as Kongo; it viewed the Portuguese with great suspicion and as an enemy. The Portuguese in the latter part of the 16th century tried to gain control of Ndongo but were defeated by the Mbundu. Ndongo experienced depopulation from slave raiding. The leaders established another state at Matamba, affiliated with Queen Nzinga, who put up a strong resistance to the Portuguese until coming to terms with them. The Portuguese settled along the coast as trade dealers, not venturing on conquest of the interior. Slavery wreaked havoc in the interior, with states initiating wars of conquest for captives. The Imbangala formed the slave-raiding state of Kasanje, a major source of slaves during the 17th and 18th centuries.[22][23] Modern history[edit] Main articles: History of Chad, History of South Sudan, History of Cameroon, History of Central African Republic, and History of the Democratic Republic of the Congo French explorer Paul Du Chaillu confirmed the existence of Pygmy peoples of central Africa During the Conference of Berlin in 1884-85 Africa was divided up between the European colonial powers, defining boundaries that are largely intact with today's post-colonial states.[24]On 5 August 1890 the British and French concluded an agreement to clarify the boundary between French West Africa and what would become Nigeria. A boundary was agreed along a line from Say on the Niger to Barruwa on Lake Chad, but leaving the Sokoto Caliphate in the British sphere.[25] Parfait-Louis Monteil was given charge of an expedition to discover where this line actually ran.[26] On 9 April 1892 he reached Kukawa on the shore of the lake.[27] Over the next twenty years a large part of the Chad Basin was incorporated by treaty or by force into French West Africa. On 2 June 1909, the Wadai capital of Abéché was occupied by the French.[28] The remainder of the basin was divided by the British in Nigeria who took Kano in 1903,[29] and the Germans in Cameroon. The countries of the basin regained their independence between 1956 and 1962, retaining the colonial administrative boundaries. In 2011, South Sudan gained its independence from the Republic of Sudan after over 50 years of war. In the 21st century, many jihadist and Islamist groups began to operate in the Central African region, including the Seleka and the Ansaru. Over the course of the 2010s, the internationally unrecognized secessionist state called Ambazonia gained increasing momentum in its home regions.[30] Economy[edit] Fishing in Central Africa The main economic activities of Central Africa are farming, herding and fishing. At least 40% of the rural population of northern and eastern Central Africa lives in poverty and routinely face chronic food shortages.[31] Crop production based on rain is possible only in the southern belt. Slash-and-burn agriculture is a common practice.[32] Flood recession agriculture is practiced around Lake Chad and in the riverine wetlands.[33] Nomadic herders migrate with their animals into the grasslands of the northern part of the basin for a few weeks during each short rainy season, where they intensively graze the highly nutritious grasses. When the dry season starts they move back south, either to grazing lands around the lakes and floodplains, or to the savannas further to the south.[34] In the 2000-01 period, fisheries in the Lake Chad basin provided food and income to more than 10 million people, with a harvest of about 70,000 tons.[31] Fisheries have traditionally been managed by a system where each village has recognized rights over a defined part of the river, wetland or lake, and fishers from elsewhere must seek permission and pay a fee to use this area. The governments only enforced rules and regulations to a limited extent.[35] Local governments and traditional authorities are increasingly engaged in rent-seeking, collecting license fees with the help of the police or army.[36] Oil is also a major export of the countries of northern and eastern Central Africa, notably making up a large proportion of the GDPs of Chad and South Sudan. Demographics[edit] Further information: Demographics of Africa, List of African countries by population, and List of ethnic groups of Africa § Central Africa UN Macroregion of Central Africa Following the Bantu Migration, Central Africa is primarily inhabited by Bantu peoples and Bantu languages predominate. These include the Mongo, Kongo and Luba peoples. Central Africa also includes many Nilo-Saharan and Niger-Congo Ubangian communities: in north western Central Africa the Nilo-Saharan Kanuri[37][38] predominate. Most of the Ubangian speakers in Africa (often grouped with Niger-Congo) are also found in Central Africa, such as the Gbaya,[39] Banda[39] and Zande,[40][39] in northern Central Africa. Notable Central African supra-regional organizations include the Lake Chad Basin Commission and the Economic Community of Central African States. The predominant religions of Central Africa are Christianity and traditional faiths. Islam is also practiced in some areas in Chad and the Central African Republic.

Similar cultural practices stemming from common origins as largely Nilo-Saharan or Bantu peoples are also evident in Central Africa including in music, dance, art, body adornment, initiation, and marriage rituals.

Administratively, Twycross forms part of the Hinckley and Bosworth district. It is named 'Twycross' because its centre lies at the intersection of three roads. The A444 connects it to Burton-on-Trent and Coventry and the B4116/B4114 to Birmingham. The Twycross Cricket Club is a village club with a 1st and 2nd XI who play in the Leicestershire Senior League. It also has a Sunday XI which plays many friendly games throughout the season. The 1st team XI play regularly in the Premier division, whilst the 2nd team XI play in division 3, which hosts a 1st team and 2nd teams while also holding a Sunday friendly team. It has a youth set-up with under-15, under-13, and under-11 teams. The church of St. James contains the oldest stained glass in England, originally from Sainte-Chapelle, Saint-Denis, and Le Mans Cathedral. The earliest glass is c.1145 from Saint-Denis, the panels having been presented to William IV who gave them to Earl Howe, who got the glazier Thomas Willement to arrange and install them in the church during its restoration in the 1840s. The video game developer Rare is based at Twycross. The company has developed games and series such as BattleToads, Grabbed by the Ghoulies, GoldenEye 007, Viva Piñata, Banjo-Kazooie, Killer Instinct, Conker, Perfect Dark, Kameo, Sea of Thieves, and many of the Donkey Kong games from as early as Donkey Kong Country in 1994 to as recent as Diddy Kong Racing DS in 2007. They became a Microsoft first-party in 2002. References[edit] ^ OS Explorer Map 232 : Nuneaton & Tamworth: (1:25 000) :ISBN 0 319 46404 0 ^ ""Civil Parish population 2011"". Neighbourhood Statistics.

229,"Deep tech: the return of the grand projects of bits and atoms - Elcano Blog Blog Global Presence EspañolesEnglishen Home About the Elcano Blog Community Standards Comments policy Legal notice and privacy policy Meet the authors Global Spectator Elcano Talks Guest contributors Contact Elcano web HomeGlobal SpectatorDeep tech: the return of the grand projects of bits and atoms Global Spectator, by Andrés Ortega Deep tech: the return of the grand projects of bits and atoms by Andrés Ortega 27/07/2021 0 Posted in Global Spectator, Technology Tuitear Print PDF Esta entrada también está disponible en: SpanishVirgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo VSS Unity at their Mojave Air and Space Port base in California, USA. Photo: LandRover MENA (CC BY 2.0) In the last few days two prominent entrepreneurs, Richard Branson of Virgin Galactic and Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon and the Blue Origin aerospace business, have boarded their respective companies’ rockets for commercial –or promotional– voyages with private passengers. It is symptomatic of the privatisation of the space race, although the major powers are getting increasingly involved in it too. Their ultimate goal is not so much tourism as mining, starting with the Moon and Mars, prospecting for rare earths and other strategic minerals. Elon Musk is also going to board one of the rockets launched by his Space X company. The other highly successful ‘physical’ project of recent months involves the vaccines against COVID-19, with a new method, the use of messenger RNA, opening up new horizons in the fight against other pandemics. And then there are the extremely costly advanced microprocessor factories that are being built in the US and elsewhere, including the possibility of one built by Intel in Europe, to reduce dependence on foundries in Taiwan and South Korea, amid chip shortages that have seen car assembly lines in Europe, Japan and elsewhere grinding to a halt. Although in the final analysis everything has a physical basis, these grand technological projects are not purely digital (requiring bits) or intangible, but consummately material (requiring bits and atoms). They would not have been achieved without the headway that has been made in artificial intelligence. This is what a report from the Boston Consulting Group and Hello Tomorrow refers to as ‘deep tech’, the new ‘great wave of innovation’. Figure 1. Deep tech ventures live at the convergence of three approaches. Source: BCG & Hello Tomorrow analysis. Deep tech can ‘transform the world as the Internet did’, according to the report. Investment in this area in the US has grown fourfold since 2016 in sectors such as synthetic biology, advanced materials, photonics and electronics, drones and robotics, and quantum computing, in addition to artificial intelligence (AI). Indeed, the report argues that there is no such thing as a deep technology, only a deep tech approach. Deep tech companies share four characteristics: they are oriented towards problems in need of solutions (they do not start with the technology and then look for the possibilities or what can be solved); they situate themselves at the convergence of approaches (science, engineering and design) and technologies (96% of deep tech ventures in the US use at least two technologies and 66% use more than one advanced technology); they centre around three clusters (matter and energy, computation and cognition, and sensing and motion); and they inhabit a complex ecosystem. Eighty-three per cent manufacture a product with a hardware component, including sensors and large computers. It is part of a new industrial era. These entrepreneurial ventures rely on an ecosystem of closely-linked actors. They cannot be undertaken in a garage, because they involve hundreds or thousands of people in dozens of universities and research laboratories. The report ranks computing and electronics, followed by healthcare in second place (exceeding vehicle manufacturing) as the largest industries in terms of R&D spending, which are considerable. Moderna and the alliance of BioNTech and Pfizer used genome sequencing to get their respective COVID-19 vaccines to the market in less than one year. These companies, which achieved a great deal in a short time, benefitted from the efforts of many others, in academia, in large corporations, as well as the support of the public sector. All these, together with nation states, are fundamental players in this wave of big tech already underway in the US, China and elsewhere, as well as the EU and its member states. The authors of the report discern what they call four ‘moments of truth’ when it comes to establishing new paradigms, which this seems to be: the Copernicus moment (how to frame the paradigm: what is the problem and could reality be different?); the Newton moment (involving the theory: how can this be made possible?); the Armstrong moment (taking the first step: can it be built today?); and the Asimov moment (involving changing reality: what does it need to become the new normal?). Part of deep tech is the revolution in electric cars and semi-autonomous cars, mainly associated with Tesla. Another is Elon Musk’s other great project: encircling the Earth with nano-satellites –he has already sent up 1,500 of the almost 12,000 planned for half-way through this decade–. The idea is to do away with the need for terrestrial infrastructure and provide paid-for access to broadband Internet (not cheap, at around €100 per month) to the remotest, and not so remote, places, where fibre-optic cables and 5G cannot reach, including depopulated parts of Spain. His venture is named Starlink, an offshoot of SpaceX, with an investment of US$30 billion, which he hopes to recoup. As far as the new space race is concerned, it has been boosted by the fact that the Moon, Mars and outer space in general have lost their status as public goods. The 1967 treaty on the subject –which, it has to be said, was becoming distinctly outdated– had been progressively eroded. In April 2020, in the midst of the COVID-19 lockdown, when the world had its eyes cast down rather than up, the then US President, Donald Trump, signed an executive order (titled ‘Encouraging international support for the recovery and use of space resources’) unilaterally permitting the private exploitation of natural resources on the Moon, something it applauded. It states that ‘Americans should have the right to engage in commercial exploration, recovery, and use of resources in outer space’, pointing out that the US had never signed the 1979 agreement known as the Moon Treaty, which defines the Moon and its natural resources as a ‘common heritage of mankind’, subject to international law. In fact, in 2015 the US Congress enacted a law that explicitly permits US companies to use resources from the Moon and asteroids. Joe Biden has not overturned the order, or stated any intention of doing so, at least for now. The race for deep tech, in which the major corporations are now engaged, will bring immense opportunities. And challenges. For Europe, there will be what a European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) analysis, by Ulrike Franke and Jose Ignacio Torreblanca, calls ‘geo-tech politics’, entailing the need for a new EU ‘tech compact’. Technology is important not only economically but also because of the leverage it provides in terms of power. And in deep tech, the EU is lagging behind, despite boasting its own major capabilities, for example in space exploration, nano-satellites and biotechnology. Space exploration is going to assume increasing importance. Even Spain has floated setting up the Spanish Space Agency, in coordination with the European Space Agency. All this goes well beyond aspiring to acquire digital sovereignty, as is evident from the coronavirus vaccines and the satellite and semiconductor industries, among other fields linked to deep tech. It is sure to have all manner of consequences. Deep consequences. Figure 2. The convergence of technologies opens up new opportunities. Source: BCG & Hello Tomorrow analysis.

We’ve had experience from time to time with fundraising, and have refined our thinking about how fundraising can complement and not undermine our Co-Counseling relationships. There are several main points to the Guidelines about fundraising (Guideline H.12). 1.  Our efforts at fundraising need to focus on bringing funds into the RC Community from those individuals who are not yet involved in RC. Voluntary contributions should only be solicited from people and institutions from outside the RC Communities. No individual member of the RC Community should be targeted for direct solicitation of funds for RC Community projects. 2.  Contributions from Co-Counselors are welcomed, but solicitation of such contributions is in violation of our no-socializing policy. We do not want any undischarged patterns about needs and money to interfere with the full development of the safety and trust necessary to make Co-Counseling relationships effective. In addition, we do not want to encourage dependency within the RC Community. 3.  Fundraising should be done primarily on a one-to-one basis with individuals with whom people have existing relationships. The basic information about RC should be shared with potential donors. As with the activity of communicating about RC, people receive the most accurate impression of RC, and the reasons to provide financial support for our activities, through one-to-one communication. Fundraising is best thought of as another way of communicating about RC, with the basis of the communication being caring about the person and providing accurate information about RC. The individual who is solicited for funds should also be viewed as a potential member of the RC Community. 4.  Any local fundraising activities should be planned in cooperation and consultation with the Regional Reference Person.

239,"Re-evaluation Counseling - Wikipedia Re-evaluation Counseling From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search This article's lead section may not adequately summarize its contents. To comply with Wikipedia's lead section guidelines, please consider modifying the lead to provide an accessible overview of the article's key points in such a way that it can stand on its own as a concise version of the article. (July 2015) Re-evaluation Counseling (RC) is a peer-based counseling procedure – 'co-counseling' – in which people aim to help each other deal with the effects of emotional hurt. The theory and practice of RC were developed in Seattle in the United States by Harvey Jackins beginning in the 1950s. In the early 1970s, the Re-evaluation Counseling Community was formed, made up of local groups of Co-Counselors in Seattle and beyond. The theory developed to recognize the importance of challenging oppressions such as sexism and racism, and working to eliminate them. RC now teaches co-counseling and holds workshops throughout the world. While membership of the RC Community requires only a commitment to a one-point program of using the co-counseling process, the community has a number of projects that directly tackle the issues of racism, sexism, anti-semitism and the climate emergency. The International Re-evaluation Counseling Community is based in Shoreline, Washington, USA. It was led by Harvey Jackins until his death in 1999. It is currently led by his son Tim Jackins. Contents 1 History 2 Therapeutic theory 3 Organization 4 Criticism 5 See also 6 References 7 Further reading 8 External links History In the early 1950s, Harvey Jackins, a shipyard worker, building maintenance worker and labor organizer, developed Re-evaluation Co-Counseling after observing that a troubled friend made changes in his thinking process as a result of being patiently listened to while he cried and expressed a range of other emotions.[1][2][3] Jackins worked with others to develop a method of counseling based on the recollection of psychological and physical traumas or ""hurts"" accompanied by various types of emotional catharsis. He called these effects ""discharge"", which he came to believe led to clearer thinking or ""re-evaluation"".[4] After several years experimenting, Jackins quit his job and took up counseling full time. In 1952 he opened a small office in downtown Seattle and offered one-way counseling under the name of Personal Counselors, Inc. The process began to be called Co-Counseling because it worked well for two people to exchange time listening to each other. [1] At that time, Jackins associated with L. Ron Hubbard and others interested in human growth.[1] Personal Counselors Inc. originally stated its objective as to ""engage in, conduct and teach the art and science of Dianetics.""[5] Because of differences in their thinking, collaboration between Jackins and Hubbard became unworkable, and Jackins ended their association.[1] RC has had no contact with Dianetics or Scientology since that time. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, Jackins systematized his views, and in the 1960s and 1970s took RC from Seattle, where he first practised it, to the rest of the US and thence to Europe and elsewhere. Between 1975 and 1990, he appointed local teachers, area representatives, regional leaders and representatives of groups such as women, African Americans, and Lesbians and Gay Men. He drafted RC's Guidelines and decided on all major issues. His policies were ratified by a biennial conference. After Jackins' death in 1999, his son, Tim Jackins, was chosen at a conference, attended by leaders in the RC communities worldwide, to take over the role of International Reference Person, the title given to the leader of RC. Therapeutic theory Re-evaluation Counseling describes itself as ""a process for freeing humans and society as a whole from distress patterns so that we may resume fully-intelligent functioning.""[6] Counseling is practiced in pairs (""co-counseling""), in which the participants listen to one another in turn and help one other to ""discharge"". No money is exchanged by the co-counselors but they pay a nominal fee to the Re-evaluation Counseling organization when attending classes or a means-based fee when attending workshops.[6] RC believes that everyone is born good and intelligent and that all hurts are acquired. Inappropriate or hurtful behavior is caused by the unconscious ""restimulation"" of past hurts that have not been properly discharged. If discharge can be completed, the behavior will not be repeated.[6] The RC counsellor aims to remember the fundamental goodness of the client. Client and counselor are expected to work co-operatively. The counselor is expected to listen in a non-judgmental way but also to ""contradict"" errors and other conditions associated with distress so as to facilitate discharge. The counselor also intervenes to ""interrupt"" the client's patterns. Each co-counselor has to be emotionally healthy and well-versed in co-counseling in order to work effectively together. RC questions the use of psychiatric drugs and the standard concept of mental illness.[7] John Heron compared RC to primal therapy, Wilhelm Reich's methods, and Freud's early psychoanalysis when he made use of abreaction. The editor of the Brunner-Routledge series of books on ""Advancing Theory in Therapy"" says that while Re-evaluation Counseling is not generally regarded as a psychotherapy, ""it has made and continues to make an important contribution to our understanding of human beings and human situations.""[2] RC considers that co-counseling does not imply psychopathology on the part of co-counselors or the need for professional treatment and that there is a need for lay counselors because of the shortage of professionals. It says that, for the average person, co-counseling can heal emotional hurts, increase rational thought and increase one's capacity for a joyful and positive life. RC's has ambitious social and environmental objectives, including, ""The transformation of society to a rational, peaceful, non-exploitative, classless form world-wide. The preservation of all existing species of life and the re-creation of extinguished species. The preservation of wilderness areas and the creation of a completely benign environment over most of the earth, the oceans, and the atmosphere. The exploration of, and eventually becoming at home in, space.""[7] Organization The organization's official title is ""The International Re-evaluation Counseling Communities"". It is resourced by Re-evaluation Counseling Community Resources, Inc., with headquarters in Shoreline, Washington, USA. Its president is Tim Jackins and its vice president is Sarah Elizabeth Jackins.[8] The corporation owns trademark in the terms ""Re-evaluation Counseling"", ""RC"" and ""United to End Racism"".[9] It also controls the Re-evaluation Foundation, a non-profit 501(c) organization, and Rational Island Publishers.[10] Within RC, Tim Jackins is called the ""International Reference Person"". He is a former community college mathematics teacher from Palo Alto, California, and a graduate of Yale and Stanford. He has been a co-counselor, leader and teacher of RC for most of his life. The International Reference Person appoints senior leaders (""reference persons"") in consultation with local groups. Local groups choose local leaders. Reference persons are consulted about who can attend events, teach RC, and lead groups. No reference person is paid.[7] RC runs classes in co-counseling and local groups are set up by people experienced in the ideas and methods of RC who have been approved by the leaders. New members are invited to join ""fundamentals"" classes by existing members. They are expected to be well-functioning and emotionally healthy so that they can be effective counselors as well as being able to benefit from counseling. Fees are fixed at a low hourly rate per person, and there are scholarships for people on low incomes. Twenty-five per cent of fees are sent to the central body in Shoreline.[7] Participants are asked not to use caffeine or alcohol and to abstain from mind-altering drugs so as to be attentive and to have access to their feelings. People who counsel together are requested and expected to refrain from socializing with one another.[11] Classes and local communities are organized into regions and loose, country-wide affiliations, although RC does not organize on national lines. RC is committed to offering RC practices and insights ""as widely as possible in the general population"". RC does not seek publicity[12] Local publicity has to be approved by the regional leader and national and international publicity by the leader of RC.[7] RC does not list local contact information on its website.[10] RC does not publish membership figures or comment on estimates. On one occasion, Jackins claimed that more than a million had attended RC ""Fundamentals"" classes.[13] Re-evaluation Counseling encourages its members to play an active role in public life[14] and has set up groups to promote its ideas, which it calls ""naturalized"" groups.[10] The main groups promoting RC methods are United to End Racism"" (UER), formed in 2000, and Sustaining All Life, formed in 2015. UER is part of RC and shares its HQ in Shoreline.[10] It participated in the 2001 Durban World Conference against Racism, the 2006 Caracas World Social Forum and the 2006 Vancouver World Peace Forum.[10] Sustaining All Life participated in the United Nations Climate Change Conference (Conference of the Parties or COPs) every year since the 2015 COP in Paris. The COPs were in Marrakech, Morocco (COP22 in 2016); Bonn, Germany (COP23 in 2017); Katowice, Poland (COP24 in 2018); and Madrid, Spain (COP25 in 2019). Other organisations that are independent of RC are led by RC community members and draw to some extent on RC concepts. An example is the National Coalition Building Institute whose Founder-Executive Director, Cherie R. Brown,[15] is a member of RC[16][17] and active in UER.[18] The Re-evaluation Foundation aims ""To provide opportunities for people to participate in Re-evaluation counseling who otherwise could not afford to participate.""[19] Founded in 1972, it supports projects based on the theory and practice of Re-evaluation Counseling that apply ""bold, thoughtful action to freeing human beings from the distresses associated with past hurtful, unjust experiences.""[10] Its president is Michael Markovits,[20] a former vice-president of IBM.[citation needed] Its assets at the end of 2006 were .[21] ""The Foundation considers grant requests only from members of the Re-evaluation Counseling Communities who are seeking financial assistance that will further the dissemination of the theory and practice of RC.""[22] In 2007, the foundation made grants totaling about to several organizations controlled by Re-evaluation Counseling, including ""People-of-Color Leadership Development, Global Initiatives, Young People Leadership Development/Family Counseling Work, Elimination of Racism, and Mental Health.""[10] Criticism Psychiatrist Richard M. Childs claimed that Jackins' book The Human Side of Human Beings (1965) plagiarized Hubbard's Dianetics (1950), saying that Jackins paraphrased Hubbard's terms by recasting them in his own jargon. Hubbard's ""Engrams"" became Jackins' ""distress patterns"", ""release"" became ""discharge"", and ""to become clear"" became RC's ""to re-emerge"".[23] Dennis Tourish and Pauline Irving in a 1995 article compared his system of management to the communist state model of democratic centralism.[24] Other critics have said that what purports to be ""Re-evaluation Counseling theory"" is merely a description of Harvey Jackins' counseling practice, that RC's ideas are untested and that ""there has been no independent attempt to verify or otherwise the key constructs of RC theory.""[25] There have been few papers about RC in scholarly journals and RC tends not to co-operate with attempts at independent investigation.[26] The organisation is sensitive to criticism, either external or internal, which it regards as an attack on the organization.[citation needed] Jackins believed that much criticism was inspired by the hostility of the US government to RC's ""profoundly progressive nature and its effectiveness"".[27] RC instructs members ""to quickly interrupt both attacks and gossip"",[7] which are ""dramatizations of distress"" and unacceptable behaviors within the RC Community. It says that ""An attack is not an effective way to resolve disagreements or difficulties."" The organisation requires that ""People who participate in an attack must first stop the attack and apologize for having participated in it"", after which they are to be offered counseling.[7] Critics who persist ""should be made to leave the group and their attacks ignored.""[10] Steve Carr criticized RC this prevention of internal discussion.[26] In an article analysing RC's so-called ""attack theory"" Steve Carr says that ""To counter attacks on RC and its leaders, RC members are instructed to interrupt the person, approach the accusation as the personal problem of the accuser, and vigorously come to the defense of the person or people being attacked.""[26] Richard Childs describes how he was treated in this way and expelled from RC when he tried to discuss allegations of sexual abuse within the organisation.[28] RC's system of centralised control has been deprecated by ex-members who would have preferred a more accountable leadership. John Heron, once an RC leader and teacher, who left the organization in 1974 to set up his own co-counseling organization, Co-Counselling International, said he parted company with RC because it ""systematically conditioned its members to associate a certain kind of beneficial human development with centralized authoritarian control of theory and community policy. It was clear to me that this was pseudo-liberation."" He considered that the authoritarianism of RC derived partly from the Leninist doctrines of central control that Jackins had learned in the Communist Party of America and partly from the autocratic example of his former associate L. Ron Hubbard.[29] Re-evaluation Counseling has been described as a cult[30] or ""cult-like"".[25] Tourish and Irving considered that RC shared several characteristics with psycho-therapeutic cults, namely, a charismatic leader, idealization of the leader, followers regarding their belief system as superior to others, followers joining the group at times of stress, the therapist becoming central to the follower's life, the group absorbing increasing time, illusions of superiority to other groups and the group becoming suspicious of other groups. They concluded: ""Given its hostility to such pluralistic notions of participation and democracy, RC has the potential to become a fully fledged and harmful cult, despite its original humanistic aims.""[24] See also Co-Counseling Harvey Jackins Tim Jackins List of psychotherapies List of counseling topics United to End Racism References ^ a b c d A Very Brief Look at the History of RC ^ a b New, Caroline and Kauffman, Katie, Co-Counselling: The Theory and Practice of Re-Evaluation Counselling, 2004, Brunner-Routledge ISBN 1-58391-210-X ^ Medicine Story, ""To Be Human Again – Camps for Peace and Love"", Talking Stick, Winter/Spring 2003 Archived 2011-08-13 at the Wayback Machine ^ Jackins, Harvey, The human side of human beings, Seattle: Rational Island Publishers, 1965 ISBN 0-911214-60-7 ^ Copy of the articles of incorporation filed by Harvey Jackins Tim Jackins.

based on the theory and practice of Re-evaluation Counseling (RC) that apply bold, thoughtful action to freeing human beings from the distresses associated with past hurtful, unjust experiences.Founded in 1972, the Foundation provides resources to help disseminate the ideas, skills, and leadership training of RC to people whose access to RC is limited by low income, geographic location, or other restrictive circumstances.Any member of the RC community may propose projects to the Foundation. The Foundation evaluates proposals and operates as an independent source of financial assistance for underwriting those that are approved. Many Foundation grants are used to train leaders who want to help families flourish, improve the work lives of men and women, and make institutions more effective and more humane. Often the financial assistance pays expenses for workshops or conferences focused on building effective working alliances within and across cultural, racial, and class groups. The Foundation frequently underwrites the financial costs of the travel, workshop tuition, meeting facilities, and RC literature that help its grantees reach across barriers caused by low income, geographic separation, and isolation.

Through our global network, we are connected to 3.5 million consumers, farmers, activists, scientists and policy makers in over 60 different countries. Our mission is to build a global network of farmers, scientists, businesses, activists, educators, journalists, policymakers and consumers who will promote and put into practice regenerative agriculture and land-use practices that: provide abundant, nutritious food; revitalize local economies; regenerate soil fertility and water-retention capacity; nurture biodiversity; and restore climate stability by reducing agricultural greenhouse gas emissions while at the same time drawing down excess atmospheric carbon and sequestering it in the soil. Our vision is for a healthy global ecosystem in which regenerative agriculture and land-use practices cool the planet, feed the world, and promote public health, prosperity, and peace. Our work, supported by the Organic Consumers Association (OCA) and other founding organizations, is focused on the following: 1. Engage the global scientific, agricultural, and activist communities in a narrative about the relationships between healthy soils, food and the climate. 2. Identify, support and promote leading experts and success stories focused on the science and best practices that support regenerative organic agriculture as a viable means to reverse global warming through carbon sequestration. 3. Aggregate, translate and disseminate the latest research linking the climate, food, natural health, environment, and economic justice movements to food and farming, and best practices for adapting regenerative techniques to different climates and cultures. 4. Unify the global grassroots through a diversity of messages and campaigns to appeal to different segments of the global body politic, including consumers and environmentalists. 5. Collaborate with universities and NGOs to train farmers in organic regenerative farming and land management techniques. 6. Mobilize consumers, farmers, and environmentalists to pressure policymakers to create policies that advance organic regenerative farming and land management practices. Our steering committee members are: Andre Leu (IFOAM Organics International), Hans Herren (Millennium Institute), John D. Liu (Environmental Education Media Project), Renate Künast (German Parliament), Ronnie Cummins (Organic Consumers Association), Steve Rye (Mercola Health), Tom Newmark (The Carbon Underground), and Vandana Shiva (Navdanya).

Most of our work falls under one of three major program areas: education, network-building and policy work. Here’s what we do: Education: We educate consumers, farmers, policymakers, media and the general public on the benefits of regenerative agriculture and land management. Network-Building: We invite groups to join our Partner Network and we assist groups or individuals at the local, regional or national level who are committed to building Regeneration Alliances. Policy Work: We identify, promote and galvanize support for local, regional, national and international policy initiatives that have the potential to advance the transition to regenerative food, farming and land management. Why It Matters Scientists tell us we’re nearly out of time to avert a climate-change disaster. Global warming will bring more droughts, hurricanes and other extreme weather events. It will create more food insecurity. It will force greater numbers of people to abandon their land and homes, worsening the migration crisis. It will lead to dwindling natural, human and financial resources, which in turn will lead to more poverty, the collapse of social support structures and greater political instability. We must do two things if we hope to reverse global warming. First, we must reduce greenhouse gas emissions by transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy alternatives. Second, we must draw down the tons of excess carbon already released into the atmosphere and sequester it in the soil by transitioning, on a global scale, to regenerative agriculture and land management practices. We believe the global transition to a regenerative food and agriculture system has the power to: Reverse global warming End world hunger Revitalize local economies Enhance human health and well-being Restore farmers’ independence by ending corporate control over the global food system Regenerate ecological health, including soil fertility and biodiversity; Promote social justice and fair trade Key Projects Alliance Building The urgency of the crisis before us demands that we do more than just build or support a patchwork of individual, disconnected regenerative agriculture or land-restoration projects. No matter how promising each project is, it will struggle to succeed without sufficient infrastructure support. Regeneration International inspires and supports the organization of regional and national Regeneration Alliances committed to building regenerative agriculture systems focused on building the infrastructure—including markets, brands, transportation, processing and policies—required to connect and support tens of thousands of promising projects that will ultimately form a global regenerative food, farming and land-use network.

Learn more here. Events & Conferences Regenerative agriculture is still a relatively new concept, especially as it relates to global warming. We work with our network to raise awareness and foster collaboration by organizing and supporting conferences and workshops in key regions throughout the world. Regeneration International sent delegations and organized workshops at the COP 21, 22, 23, 24 and 25 global climate summits.

Partners University of Oxford provides funding as a member of The Conversation UK. View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger In the archive of the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology there is a typed note from the 1960s that planted the seed of an idea. Written by Kenneth Mellanby, director of the Monks Wood Experimental Station, a former research centre in Cambridgeshire, UK, the note describes a four-hectare arable field that lies next to the station and the ancient woodland of the Monks Wood National Nature Reserve. After harvesting a final barley crop, the field was ploughed and then abandoned in 1961. The note reads: It might be interesting to watch what happens to this area if man does not interfere. Will it become a wood again, how long will it take, which species will be in it? So began the Monks Wood Wilderness experiment, which is now 60 years old. A rewilding study before the term existed, it shows how allowing land to naturally regenerate can expand native woodland and help tackle climate change and biodiversity loss. The Monks Wood Wilderness field (outlined in red) shortly after abandonment in the early 1960s. UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, Author provided How new woodland generates itself A shrubland of thorn thickets emerged after the first ten to 15 years. Dominated by bramble and hawthorn, its seeds were dropped by thrushes and other berry-eating birds. This thicket protected seedlings of wind-blown common ash and field maple, but especially English oak, whose acorns were planted by Eurasian jays (and maybe grey squirrels too) as forgotten food caches. It’s thought that jays were particularly busy in the Monks Wood Wilderness, as 52% of the trees are oaks. Jays habitually collect and cache acorns in autumn. Forgotten caches germinate into oak seedlings. UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, Author provided The intermediate shrubland stage was a suntrap of blossom and wildflowers. Rabbits, brown hares, muntjac deer and roe deer were all common, but the protective thicket meant there was no need for fencing to prevent them eating the emerging trees. Those trees eventually rose up and closed their canopy above the thicket, which became the woodland understorey. The result is a structurally complex woodland with multiple layers of tree and shrub vegetation, and accumulating deadwood as the habitat ages. This complexity offers niches for a wide variety of woodland wildlife, from fungi and invertebrates in the dead logs and branches, to song thrushes, garden warblers and nuthatches which nest in the ground layer, understorey and tree canopy. The Monks Wood Wilderness in 2021, after 60 years of natural regeneration. UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, Author provided The Monks Wood experiment benefited from the field lying close to an ancient woodland, which meant an ample supply of seeds and agents for their dispersal – jays, rodents, and the wind. Such rapid colonisation of the land would be unlikely in more remote places, or where deer are superabundant. But there are many woods in the UK that could expand by allowing adjacent fields to return to nature. This would eventually add up to a significant increase in total woodland cover. The Monks Wood Wilderness (outlined in red) in 2014. UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, Author provided Tree planting or natural regeneration? The UK is one of the least forested places in Europe, with just 13% forest cover compared to an average of 38% across the EU. Only half of the UK’s forest is native woodland, which sustains a wide variety of indigenous species. The rest is dominated by non-native conifer plantations grown for timber. This situation is gradually changing. The UK government aims to create 30,000 hectares of new woodland each year until 2025, providing new habitat for wildlife and helping reach net zero emissions, as woodland stores more carbon than any other habitat except peatlands. With the climate and biodiversity crises getting worse each day, there’s an urgent need to expand woodland fast. But how? Tree planting is the usual approach, but it’s costly. Saplings also have to be grown, transported, planted and protected with fencing and plastic tubes – that’s a lot of carbon emissions and potential plastic pollution, as tubes break down into the soil. What about doing virtually nothing instead? Natural regeneration involves creating woodlands by allowing trees and shrubs to plant themselves under natural processes. It’s free and involves no plastic or nursery-grown saplings, which can introduce diseases. The result is woodland that’s well adapted to local conditions. Oak seedlings were early pioneers in the regeneration of the woodland. UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, Author provided Allowing the land to naturally regenerate sounds exciting, but planners and ecologists need to know where this approach is likely to work best. How abandoned land turns into woodland is rarely documented, as it usually happens where people have walked away. The Monks Wood Wilderness fills in this gap in our knowledge as an example of planned natural regeneration that has been monitored over decades, with a second two-hectare field (named the New Wilderness) added in 1996 to expand the experiment. Shrubland in the New Wilderness field after 25 years, with hawthorns blossoming. UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, Author provided Since the 1990s, the two Wildernesses have been regularly surveyed by scientists counting and measuring trees on foot and tracking tree cover from planes and drones. These surveys documented the development of woodland over 60 years in our recently published study, revealing the patterns of habitat regeneration. We can now finally answer Mellanby’s 60-year old questions. Within 40 to 50 years, the ploughed field became a closed canopy woodland with almost 400 trees per hectare. And as the canopy grows taller, more plant and animal species are arriving, such as marsh tits and purple hairstreak butterflies – mature woodland specialists that have made a home here as the habitat gradually converges with the ancient woodland nearby. The Wilderness experiment shows what’s possible when nature is allowed to create rich, native woodland for free. I think Mellanby would be pleased with how it all turned out.

By promoting dialogue and collaboration among all environmental stakeholders, CAREC has today become a leading regional knowledge hub in the field of environment and sustainable development recognised by national, regional and international partners. CAREC was established in 2001 by a joint decision of all five Central Asian states (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan), European Union and UNDP, following the resolution of the IV Pan-European Conference held in 1998, Aarhus (Denmark). History + 2001 CAREC began its operations in 2001 Since then, operating through its head office located in Almaty, Kazakhstan and well-established country office network in five Central Asian states, CAREC takes a lead in environmental cooperation in the region. Since its inception, CAREC has emerged into regional organisation capable to fulfill its mandate to promote environmental cooperation and sustainable development in the Central Asian region. The organisation was vested with the authority to develop and implement the Central Asian Initiative on Sustainable Development. The EU and other international organisations supported CAREC's emergence as a regional platform for environmental cooperation. State bodies, non-governmental organisations and international agencies acknowledge CAREC as a professional and reliable partner. 2009 Though direct funding for CAREC ceased in 2009 it continues to operate by adapting to new financial environment through participation in competitive bidding processes through its thematic programs. Over the last 16 years, the Centre has developed its human, technical and institutional capacity and became a truly independent and recognised environmental organisation. 2016 CAREC celebrated its 15th anniversary in 2016. For over 15 years of work, the organisation proved to be a unique platform for cooperation between Central Asian environmental community and international partners which meets the interests of both concerned government agencies and NGO sector in CAR. CAREC will continue carrying out its mission and promoting donor initiatives in the region on a wide range of sustainability issues. Central Asian governments consider CAREC as a tool allowing to engage in international environmental processes, to expand their potential of accessing international funding mechanisms in the field of climate change and biodiversity and assisting in promoting regional environmental management models such as Executive Committee of the International Fund for saving the Aral Sea (EC IFAS) and Intergovernmental Commission on Sustainable Development (ICSD). Numerous requests from donor agencies, state bodies and civil society organizations of CA countries once more highlight the need for structural reinforcement of CAREC’s catalyzing and coordinating role in the region. 2020 CAREC plans to expand its partnerships to strengthen regional environmental management processes by 2020. The organization is committed to become regional knowledge, research and information hub on environmental issues, while continuing to act as a recognised social entrepreneur.

The Basque Country is appointed as Chair for the North Our mission To empower regional governments by enabling the strongest connections inside and outside the network and translating them into impactful action. Our values Closeness Ownership Solidarity Diversity & Collaboration Leadership Taking care of our relationships is our way of strengthening our ties and honouring our interdependence. To us, the quality of our connections is what builds community and common purpose. After all, organisations are made of people, and only people can drive change. Our network is made for regions and by regions. Every step we take is the result of a collaborative process. We believe that co-accountability leads to meaningful action, close to real needs and real impact targeted. To us, each territory is unique and indispensable for the valorisation and protection of life. All background is valid, and all knowledge counts. We believe everyone has something to share and learn in our global community and no one should be left behind. The diversity of our parts is the wealth of our whole. Through strong connections inside and outside our network, we enable pathways to cooperation, learning, and innovation. Every connection is an opportunity to be inspired and to inspire. As relevant members of the international community, our Network and its regions have their own voice and independence of criteria in order to take decisions and raise their voice for a more sustainable development worldwide. Why are Regional Governments important for sustainable development? 1 Closeness to citizens: understanding of social demands, capacity to engage stakeholders and strategic position to trigger behaviours. 2 Strategic link between the local & the national levels: vertical integration of policies, as well as coordination and coherence of actions. 3 Strategic competences that amplify the capacity of national governments towards the achievement of global goals. 4 Proximity to the territory: better understanding of issues and position to act, collection of bottom-up information for global decisions. 5 Holistic understanding of jurisdictions: comprehensive ecosystem approach ensuring rural-urban linkages and localisation of global goals.

However, in present times, the Earth faces environmental issues such as deforestation, global warming, and air pollution, and there are concerns for the impact that such problems may have on society and economy, in areas such as food safety, water resources, and climate change issues. In order to get an extensive view of the entire Earth, it is necessary to make use of observation equipment (sensors) such as satellites, and apply remote sensing technologies to conduct observations of the Earth’s surfaces from a remote location. RESTEC aims to establish remote sensing technologies as a form of social infrastructure through comprehensive research and development, raising of awareness, and human resource development in the field of remote sensing, and by doing so, contribute to the development of social economy and improvement of the people’s lives. RESTEC uses this technology to obtain data and information from satellites, aircraft, automobiles, observation towers, ships, buoys, and other observation points. By distributing the information obtained to users, RESTEC contributes to the resolution of issues such as environmental problems and climate change problems. RESTEC communicates the Earth of the present times to you. At the heart of the remote sensing industry For the last 45 years since its foundation, RESTEC has been receiving and processing data acquired by both domestic and foreign earth-observation satellites and providing those data to researchers and operational users under the contract with Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and other related organizations. In parallel with those activities RESTEC has been conducting R&D of remote sensing technologies under the contract with pertinent agencies as well as independently and endeavoring to disseminate the achievement of those R&D. RESTEC, as the core organization of satellite remote sensing in Japan, aspires to build remote sensing technologies as a social infrastructure, through providing policy makers, researchers and other satellite data users with remote sensing solutions by collecting, archiving, processing and analyzing remote sensing data required by the users. Based on those experiences and proprietary knowledge it has acquired in the fields of satellite operations, analysis of remote sensing data, value added services and remote sensing trainings, RESTEC intends to expand its businesses in the new area such as providing remote sensing solutions not alone in domestic but international projects. In addition, it implements basic and comprehensive R&D of remote sensing and provides both domestic and foreign personnel with training as well as promoting cooperation in many international projects from the viewpoint of public interest and welfare. リモートセンシングとは、「物を触らずに調べる」技術です。観測機器（センサ）を人工衛星などに搭載し、宇宙から地球全体を見つめることが可能です。RESETCはこの技術を用いて、防災、社会インフラ、地理空間情報、農業、漁業、環境、SDGs等へ貢献します。 Privacy Policy Site Map Site Policy Our Business Solution Businesses Research and Development Capacity Building Think tank/Consulting Earth Observation Examples of Solutions Infrastructure Map Agriculture Forest Ocean Weather Disaster SDGs Imaging products and services Satellite imaging products Added value services AW3D Training International Training Domestic Training Outreach Outline of Remote Sensing Basics of Remote Sensing Glossary Organization About RESTEC History Outline Message from the President Access Supporting Members Privacy Policy Contact Copyright © 2020 Remote Sensing Technology Center of Japan.",Remote Sensing Technology Center of Japan

Around 70% of disasters around the world can be attributed to water, such as through flooding. For successful rescue operations and in mitigating secondary disasters, quick and accurate ascertainment of such situations is an absolute must. SAR images allow observation even at night or in rough weather, to understand the movement, spread and amount of water. This not only contributes to emergency responses, mitigation of disasters and restoration work, but it can also contribute to risk aversion in disasters and in business.

(September 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The logo of the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership (REEEP), including tagline ""Investing in Clean Energy Markets"" The Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership (REEEP) is a Vienna-based international organisation (link in German) that advances markets for renewable energy and energy efficiency with a particular emphasis on the emerging markets and developing countries. Its primary focus is in de-risking and scaling up clean energy business models. REEEP was originally launched by the government of the United Kingdom, along with other partners, at the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in August 2002. Contents 1 Origins 2 Business model 2.1 Invest 2.2 Learn 2.3 Share 3 Project interventions 4 Internet-based resources 4.1 Climate Tagger 4.2 reegle.info 5 Partners 6 See also 7 References 8 External links Origins[edit] In 2002, accelerating the development of renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies was one of the priorities of a large group of countries at the WSSD. Margaret Beckett, then UK Minister for the Environment announced the initiative to form REEEP at the summit's closing session. It grew from an agreement with other committed governments, businesses and NGOs to deliver WSSD commitments others, in particular to take forward the key recommendations of the G8 Renewable Energy Task Force. From January 2003 until May 2004, the REEEP was housed within the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) where it continued following the UN Type II Partnership[1] process of stakeholder consultation. In June 2004, REEEP obtained formal, legal non-profit status as an international NGO and has since been located at the UN complex in Vienna, Austria. In 2016, REEEP was granted status as a quasi-international organisation in Austria, along with four other organisations. Business model[edit] It pursues its market catalyst role via an approach it calls ""Invest – Learn – Share"": Invest[edit] A typical REEEP Invest-Learn-Share effort begins with a country or regional level analysis to determine market gaps and opportunities for clean technology deployment; a stakeholder landscape to understand key players and influencers; and an assessment of medium to long-term (5 to 15-year) market potential for delivering climate and sustainable development outcomes. These assessments are synthesised into a project strategy outlining technology and sector targets; investment vehicles and volumes; policy and regulatory considerations; ecosystem stakeholders and evidence requirements; and engagement strategies. The investment solicitation and selection process begins once capitalisation has been secured through donor agreements. The process is typically launched via a call for proposals. Specifics of the call are adaptable, and depend on the realities of the market, as well as upon timing and administrative requirements of donors and local stakeholders. In some cases, multiple capital pools may be combined into a single call for proposals; in other cases, beneficiaries are identified through recommendations from expert networks and approached on an ad hoc basis. In those cases where capitalisation is provided through a debt-issuing revolving fund, smaller calls for proposals may be issued as the fund is recapitalised by loan repayments. These innovative vehicles represent a promising new approach to growing investment in sectors that have fallen through the finance cracks due to ticket sizes (too large for microfinance, too small for private equity or commercial debt). As part of a proposal SMEs are required to submit an application form, including a draft business plan, demonstrating their ability to provide a viable, clean technology-based product or service to a market in a least developed country (LDC) or middle-income country (MIC). SMEs are challenged to demonstrate how a business plan will lead to certain outcomes connected to REEEP's core principles: reducing the effects of climate change and building local prosperity. In some cases, these outcomes may be integrated into the selection processes as specific procurement objectives, allowing for results-based financing. After initial application and due diligence process, successful applicants develop a strategic plan incorporating a stakeholder analysis, key activities, outputs and outcomes, benchmarking and key performance indicators (KPIs), and contingency planning, among other elements. This strategic plan forms the basis of entry as a project investment. Throughout its work, REEEP uses Results-Based Finance methods to verify project progress. Learn[edit] REEEP utilises a mixed methodology approach to monitoring, evaluation and learning designed to handle the complexity of the situations our investments face on the ground and the multiplicity of stakeholders involved, and to manage the various types and volumes of information flowing in and out of the project environment. REEEP uses a Theory of Change as a high level project strategy guide, taking into account market context and cross-cutting considerations. For each investment REEEP makes as part of a market acceleration project, it develops a SME-specific strategic plan that incorporates a stakeholder analysis; key activities, outputs and outcomes; benchmarking and key performance indicators (KPIs); and contingency planning, among other elements. This strategy typically includes a Logical Framework Approach (Logframe) template. The plan is designed to ensure that the investment logic will lead to project objectives. We internally test the business plan, including activities, structure and strategy for growth, to confirm they have been adequately planned to deliver a high probability of success. In cases where intelligence and evidence from similar projects would suggest altering the business plan, we will consult with the submitter on making appropriate changes. REEEP also works with entrepreneurs to perform Outcome Mapping, a critical element of any project that relies on specific actions or behavioural changes from a broad group of stakeholders amid imperfect market settings. The Outcome Mapping begins with an analysis of stakeholders — individuals, organisations, government bodies, etc. — who influence the ability of a project to reach an objective. In doing so, REEEP tests entrepreneurs’ understanding of the stakeholder landscape: Are they aware of existing and potential competitors? Do they understand customer needs and unique characteristics? Are they relying upon a policy change in the future for their business model to be viable, and if so what are they doing to bring the change about? We track identified behavioural changes (or non-changes) that occur throughout the project. By understanding people, relationships and behaviours we can allow for real-time reflection and rapid reaction. Finally, REEEP captures significant changes and impacts through a method of storytelling with an open format dialogue. These changes — known as Most Significant Changes — can be planned or unplanned, positive or negative, and the precise nature of these changes may be equally unknown beforehand. By recording and processing these elements we can adjust business plans, project scope or overall strategy if necessary. Combining these components leads to a holistic framework greater than the sum of its parts, which captures a broad range of key information and variety that make up the complex systems in which we are operating. Share[edit] Market intelligence produced by the Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning process is directed into three information flows: the first is a dynamic feedback loop into the Theory of Change and project strategy review; the other two are outward flows of business intelligence and policy intelligence, respectively. Commercial intelligence comprises the full range of business and investment-related data and insights, which are further processed to derive actionable commercial best practices. These are anonymised and synthesised to advise other SME investments in the REEEP portfolio on best practices. At the same time, REEEP generates actionable investment intelligence, which can influence or even lead to concrete investment pipelines for larger investors (multilateral development banks, impact investors, venture (growth) capital funds, mezzanine funds etc.). This intelligence is a critical de-risking mechanism for specific downstream investors, as well as the investment climate in general. Policy intelligence, comprising data and information on the ecosystem conditions of specific markets (including legal, regulatory, economic and political circumstances that act as external influencers on business and market activity), are further processed to derive actionable practice-based policy learning and recommendations. These can be utilised by partner organisations and decision makers involved in legislation and/or other policy and regulatory development processes. The form of REEEP's practiced-based policy will vary depending upon case to fit the needs of the policy making process in question. Although there is a logical sequence to the Invest-Learn-Share approach, this does not imply rigidity in timing; rather, it is an iterative process, in which stakeholders, such as regulators, policy makers and financial actors, are included early and at regular intervals in the project throughout its lifetime. To date[when?] the organisation has been funded primarily by governments including: Australia, Austria, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, The Netherlands, The United Kingdom, The United States and the European Commission. Project interventions[edit] In the first phase of its existence (2002-2014) REEEP acted largely as a re-granting institution, funding nearly 200 projects. The majority have targeted emerging markets such as India, China, South Africa and Brazil. These REEEP projects attempted to address two key barriers to clean energy development, and gather and aggregate information on them: Policy and regulation: promoting clear government policies and favourable, transparent and stable regulatory frameworks that will encourage long-term investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency Innovative finance and business models: supporting new forms of financing, risk mitigation and business models to make small-sized renewable and energy efficient projects bankable. Since 2014, REEEP dramatically focused its work toward the targeted ""de-risking"" of specific markets and sectors, such as solar-powered irrigation systems in East Africa, solar-powered dairy cooling in Bangladesh, or innovative decentralized mini-grid models in Tanzania. Regionally, REEEP has shifted concentration to low- and middle-income countries, although it continues to work in India and South Africa, which are generally considered to be emerging markets: East Africa: Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda Southern Africa: South Africa, Zambia, Botswana Southeast Asia: Cambodia, Myanmar South Asia: India, Bangladesh, Nepal REEEP's ongoing projects include: Power Africa: Beyond the Grid Fund for Zambia - a major fund to stimulate markets for off-grid electrification solutions in Zambia Powering Agrifood Value Chains - a project to develop evidence-based intervention guidance for energy utilisation in the food-producing agricultural sector. Climate Change, Clean Energy and Urban Water Works in Southern Africa - a joint REEEP-UNIDO project to accelerate market-based solutions for energy-related investment to improve municipal water works in Southern Africa. SWITCH Africa Green - a project to support African countries in their transition to an Inclusive Green Economy and promoting sustainable consumption and production (SCP) practices and patterns. Climate Knowledge Brokers Group - a community of practice that furthers improvements and efficiency gains in the global climate knowledge system. Internet-based resources[edit] Climate Tagger[edit] Climate Tagger is a project to help organizations catalog their data and information in a consistent manner. reegle.info[edit] reegle (in lower-case) was a clean energy information portal designed to provide easy access to highly reliable information on renewable energy and energy efficiency. The website draws information from eight different open data sources such as the World Bank, UNdata, OpenEI, the CIA Factbook, and the REEEP Sustainable Energy Regulation Network publications to provide understanding of energy issues. reegle was developed by REEEP in collaboration with REN21, and was funded by the governments of Germany, Netherlands, United Kingdom. As of March 2012, the website attracted an average of 220,000 users per month. During 2011, 59% of its users came from Africa and Asia, underlining the site's character as an information resource for developing countries and emerging markets. reegle was an advocate of the Linked Open Data movement, which seeks to make public data available on the web in open formats that are machine-readable. Partners[edit] Currently REEEP has 385 partners, 45 of which are governments, including all the G7 countries and key government agencies from India and China, other emerging markets and the developing world. Partners also include a range of businesses, NGOs and civil society organisations. REEEP operates within a diverse constellation of players, and collaborates with other international structures and organisations to maximise replication and minimise duplication of efforts. Among other organisations, REEEP is actively engaged with the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the International Energy Agency (IEA), MEDREP, the Global Village Energy Partnership [2] (GVEP),CLASP, the Johannesburg Renewable Energy Coalition (JREC), GNESD, EREC, NAIMA, EURIMA, e-parliament and GFSE.

Objectives REEEP invests in clean energy markets to help developing countries expand modern energy services and improve lives; increase prosperity and economic dynamism; and keep CO2 emissions in check: a paradigm commonly known as green growth. REEEP’s tools are modern clean energy technologies – renewable energy and energy efficiency – market forces, and knowledge management. Activities REEEP is a pathfinder organisation which invests in and works with small- and medium-sized enterprises offering clean energy solutions in frontier markets, primarily in East and Southern Africa and in Southeast Asia. REEEP designs public-private financing approaches, leveraging partnerships with governments and the private sector to unlock new sources of financing for the low-carbon energy transition. REEEP is the executing partner of the Private Financing Advisory Network (PFAN), which offers business coaching and investor matchmaking to climate and clean energy projects from low and middle-income countries all over the world. REEEP is a leading promoter and publisher of Linked Open Data, and a founding member of the Climate Knowledge Brokers Group. REEEP works to make good-quality, relevant and timely climate change information available to decision makers everywhere.

Its focus is education and professional membership for those working and upskilling to work in renewable energy, energy storage, energy efficiency, energy conservation, hydrogen energy, electric vehicles. The Renewable Energy Institute is the first [1] Renewable Energy Institute in the Western Hemisphere.[2][3] The Renewable Energy Institute, in cooperation with the affiliated European Energy Centre, European Centre of Technology and Centro Studi Galileo, runs a biennial European Conference on renewable energy, heating and cooling applications. The Institute was founded to assist with renewable energy education, training and conferences and to help develop a workforce capable of designing, installing, repairing and maintaining renewable energy equipment and managing renewable energy projects.[4] The Renewable Energy Institute, European Energy Centre, European Centre of Technology and Centro Studi Galileo work with the United Nations Environment Programme[5][6] (UNEP)[7] the Intergovernmental International Institute of Refrigeration [8] and Centro Studi Galileo,[9] along with Universities such as Edinburgh Napier University and Heriot-Watt University in promoting the use of renewable energy technologies across the United Kingdom. The Renewable Energy Institute is also active European-wide[10] with workshops and conferences in renewable energy, Heating and Cooling technologies, see the 14th European Conference at Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh. The training activities of the institute, the European Centre of Technology, and its parent company Centro Studi Galileo are promoted through international and global partners.[11] [12][13] The Renewable Energy Institute won the 2020 award issued by the Energy Institute [14] Activities of the Institute[edit] European conferences organised with the UN (UNEP) on the latest technologies in renewable energy[15] Publications with the United Nations Environment Programme Promotion of best practices in renewable energy through training technicians and personnel Launching the Green New Deal in Europe, the United States of America and India References[edit] ^ ""Powerengineeringint"".
