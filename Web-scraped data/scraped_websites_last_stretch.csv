WMA was formally established on September 18, 1947[1] and has grown to 115 national medical associations, as of 2021, with 1467 Associate Members, including Junior Doctors and medical students. [2][3] and more than 10 million physicians.

This organization was built from an idea born in the House of the British Medical Association in 1945, within a meeting organized in London to initiate plans for an international medical organization to replace l'Association Professionnelle Internationale des Médecins"", which had suspended its activities because of World War II.[1] In order to facilitate financial support from its member associations, in 1948, the executive board, known as the Council, established the Secretariat of the WMA in New York City in order to provide close liaison with the United Nations and its various agencies. The WMA Secretariat remained in New York City until 1974 when for reasons of economy, and in order to operate within the vicinity of Geneva-based international organizations (WHO, ILO, ICN, ISSA, etc.) it was transferred to its present location in Ferney-Voltaire, France. The WMA members gathered in an annual meeting, which from 1962 was named ""World Medical Assembly."" Since its beginning WMA has shown concern over the state of medical ethics in general and over the world, and worked on a modernized wording of the ancient oath of Hippocrates, which was sent for consideration at the II General Assembly in Geneva in 1948. The medical vow was adopted and the Assembly agreed to name it the ""Declaration of Geneva."" Also in the same II General Assembly a report on ""War Crimes and Medicine"" was received. This prompted the Council to appoint another Study Committee to prepare an International Code of Medical Ethics, which after an extensive discussion, was adopted in 1949 by the III General Assembly. Governance[edit] General Assembly[edit] The main decision-making body of the WMA is the General Assembly, which meets annually and is formed by delegations from the National Member Associations, officers and members of the Council of the WMA, and representatives of the Associate Members (Associate Members are individual physicians who wish to join the WMA). Council[edit] The Assembly elects the WMA Council every two years with representatives drawn from each of the six WMA regions, namely Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, North America and the Pacific. It also elects the WMA president annually, who is the Ceremonial Head of the WMA. The President, President Elect and Immediate Past President form the Presidium that is available to speak for the WMA and represent it officially. Every two years, the WMA Council, excluding the Presidium, elects a Chairperson who is the political head of the organization. As Chief Executive of the operational units of the WMA, the Secretary-General is in full-time employment at the Secretariat, appointed by the WMA Council. Secretariat[edit] The WMA Secretariat is situated in Ferney-Voltaire, France, adjacent to the City of Geneva. Since 2005, Dr. Otmar Kloiber is the Secretary-General. Official languages[edit] English, French, and Spanish are the official languages of the association since its creation. Membership[edit] Map showing the 112 WMA Constituent Members The WMA have the following status of membership: Constituent Membership: Mainly applies for members who are typically National Associations of Physicians from different countries in the world (sometimes these organizations are called National Medical Associations).[4] Such associations are broadly representative of the physicians of their country by virtue of their membership. They range from chambers to orders, from colleges to private associations. Some of these have compulsory membership and some are trade unions. Associate Membership: Applies for Individual physicians that want to join the WMA and who have voting rights at the Annual Associate Members Meeting and the right to participate in the General Assembly through the chosen representatives of the Associate Members. See more information on Membership by clicking on the following link (WMA Membership): Projects[edit] The WMA is active in several areas of action,[5] but mainly in: Advocacy Ethics Health Systems Human Rights Public Health In what concerns Ethics, the WMA has various Declarations, Resolutions and Statements with which tries to help to guide National Medical Associations, governments and international organizations throughout the world. A wide range of subjects are covered like the rights of patients, research on human subjects, care of the sick and wounded in times of armed conflict, torture of prisoners, the use and abuse of drugs, family planning and pollution.[6] WMA also works on: Medical education Human resources planning for health care services Patient safety Leadership and career development Advocacy for physicians' and patients' rights Occupational health and safety Democracy building for new medical associations Public health policy Projects such as tobacco control and immunization The WMA also works on Education Programs such as the prison-medicine course, the MDR-TB and the TB refresher course, the ethics course and the course on microbial resistance (together with the George Mason University and the International Society for Microbial Resistance). The WMA Medical Ethics Manual The World Medical and Health Policy Journal Caring Physicians of the World Controversies[edit] During the World Medical Association General Assembly in Reykjavik in early October 2018, members of the Canadian Medical Association stated that parts of the speech by WMA's incoming president Leonid Eidelman had been plagiarized from a speech made in 2014 by Chris Simpson (cardiologist) who was then the president of CMA. Current president Dr. Gigi Osler told the group that part of the address was ""copied word for word"" from Simpson's speech. ""Multiple other parts of the speech were also copied from various websites, blogs and news articles, without proper appropriate attribution to the authors"", she latter added in a statement. A motion by Canada at the Assembly to call on Eidelman to resign was not successful.[7] On 6 October, the CMA resigned; their press release stated that the decision was made because WMA was not upholding ethical standards.[8] In an email to The Canadian Press, WMA spokesman Nigel Duncan said that Eidelman's speech had been written by others and that he did not know that it might contain plagiarism.[7] A WMA source also told The Canadian Press that Eidelman apologized at the general assembly, after the Canadian delegates had departed; he ""acknowledge[d] that part of his speech was taken from Simpson"", and most delegates ""accepted his apology"" for the mistake.[9][10] See also[edit] Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) Declaration of Geneva Declaration of Helsinki Declaration of Tokyo.

Introduction There are different categories of membership within the WMA: Constituent Membership – This category of members is typically represented by National Associations of Physicians from different countries in the world. Such associations are broadly representative of the physicians of their country by virtue of their membership, with their voting membership being limited to physicians and medical students. They are not subject to, or controlled by, any office or agency of government. Associate Membership – Individual physicians can join the WMA as Associate Members, with voting rights at the Annual Associate Members Meeting and the right to participate in the General Assembly through the chosen representatives of the Associate Members. Other classes of Membership can also be established by the Assembly, should it be appropriate and in the best interest of the WMA. Benefits of Membership Recognition and acceptance as a member of an international organization such as the WMA lends tremendous credibility to a National Medical Association (NMA). This is particularly true when there is more than one professional association representing physicians in a country. The WMA is in official relations with United Nations agencies such as the World Health Organization, which gives NMAs and Associate Members access to these world bodies. By participating in the debate with colleagues from all over the world, NMAs and Associate Members have the opportunity to provide the world with valuable ethical guidance and leadership in health care. Information and knowledge can be sourced from the WMA, which can contribute to the optimal efficacy of NMAs and individual physicians. NMAs and Associate Members can make use of the WMA’s products and services.

In the same year, he was appointed vice president of the German Medical Association. He was the latter's president from 2011 to 2019. In 2015, Montgomery was elected vice chairman of the World Medical Association. In July 2017, he became chairman of the board of directors of Deutsche Apotheker- und Ärztebank which is a bank specialised on physicians and pharmacists in Germany as customers. The assembly of the World Medical Association on 25 April 2019 at Santiago de Chile elected him as chairman of the board for two years. He is also president of the Standing Committee of European Doctors since 2019.[2][3] Contents 1 Career 2 Ethical positions 3 Criticism 4 References 5 External links Career[edit] Montgomery was born in Hamburg to a British father who came to Germany during World War II as a military officer, and a German mother who was a physician.[1] He lives in Hamburg and is married to a physician with whom he has two children. After studying medicine in Hamburg and Sydney, he became an approved medical doctor in Germany in 1979. He became a specialist for radiology in 1986. He was chairman of the Hamburg chapter of Marburger Bund from 1983 to 2016. Moreover, he is member of the board of Deutsche Ärzteversicherung (German physicians' insurance) and was chairman of the German Medical Association from 1987 to 2002. From 1994 to 2002 and again from 2002 to 2018 he was president of the Hamburg Chamber of Physicians.[3] As president of the German Medical Association, he held one of two co-chairs of the German Agency for Quality in Medicine.[4] Until the end of 2018, Montgomery worked as an attending physician at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf.[5] In 2012, the senate of the city of Hamburg awarded the honorary degree of 'Professor' to Montgomery. This was done in recognition of his engagement in social and health politics, science and medical ethics.[6] In 2013, he was honored with the Dr.-Günther-Buch-Prize for medicine by the 'Johanna-und-Fritz-Buch-Gedächtnis-Stiftung'.[7] The Jewish Community of Düsseldorf awarded a medal to Montgomery in 2019 for his work on clarifying the role of the German Medical Association during the Nazi era, and for establishing ties to the Israel Medical Association.[8] Ethical positions[edit] In 2001, Montgomery backed the banning of preimplantation genetic diagnosis in Germany.[9] One year later, he spoke out against the practice of forced application of emetics to secure criminal evidence, but recommended applying laxatives instead.[10] He also advocates a mandatory vaccination against measles.[11] In May 2020, he recommended a mandatory vaccination against the COVID-19 virus should there ever be a suitable vaccine.[12] Criticism[edit] When he was vice president of the German Medical Association, Montgomery was criticised over his statements in a bribery scandal. Some 3,000 physicians had received gifts or money for prescribing Ratiopharm medical products, and an investigation had been launched in the city of Ulm because of multiple suspicions of fraud and breach of trust. Montgomery called the business practices of physicians who had prescribed Ratiopharm products a ""totally normal and natural behaviour"", which could not be considered punishable.[13] While the Ulm prosecutor found that the first two physicians involved in the issue had been bribed by Ratiopharm with a total amount of EUR 19,180, the investigation was closed in 2013 due to a lack of criminally relevant cases.[14][15] In 2012, the Federal Court of Justice of Germany ruled that physicians with a licence to bill the public health insurances in Germany cannot be prosecuted for bribery.[16] Montgomery commented that the court had chosen the right path, but then also stated that no physician in Germany was allowed to accept gifts from pharmaceutical companies.[17] According to article 34 of the professional responsibility code of German physicians, it is prohibited to ask for or accept compensations for prescribing medicine.[13] In January 2013, he rejected political demands of turning the bribing of physicians into a criminal offence. ""We reject a legal solution when it is a lex specialis made against physicians. We would, however, not oppose a law that is valid for all freelancers, i.e. also for architects, lawyers and journalists."" Instead he demanded more investigative competencies be given to the medical associations and an ""improvement in the framework for penalties"" regarding matters of professional responsibility.[18] During the COVID-19 pandemic in April 2020, Montgomery was accused of unsettling the public and not living up to his responsibilities. He had called the wearing of scarves or cloths to cover mouth and nose ""ridiculous"".[19] Virologist Alexander Kekulé described Montgomery's theses on facial covers as incomprehensible and ""blatant nonsense"".[20] Montgomery was blamed for acting dangerously by creating doubts about the mandatory wearing of facial covers in Germany during the pandemic. His criticism of the government's failure to acquire stocks of high-quality facial masks in time was appreciated though.[21] References[edit] ^ a b ""Frank Ulrich Montgomery"".

The WOC is an international organization registered in the US, has a global footprint of action and Membership and is administrated by the Secretariat under the direction of a Board of Directors comprised of senior industry representatives from around the world. History Since its inception as a network of ocean businesses concerned with ocean stewardship, the WOC has grown to become the only international and cross-sectoral industry leadership alliance focused on “Corporate Ocean Responsibility” on a global scale. Aligning core ocean business interests with sustainable development is critical to achieving healthy oceans. The WOC was created to address the Ocean Business Community’s needs, opportunities and challenges for a coordinated cross sectoral approach to ocean sustainable development, responsible use and environmental management. In the mid-1990s, Mr Paul Holthus was co-leading the Global Marine Program of IUCN-The World Conservation Union. Outreach to ocean industries confirmed the business community’s interest in ocean sustainability issues, but revealed the limitations of what responsible companies could achieve individually. Many companies were interested in developing inter-industry leadership and collaboration as a way to better address ocean issues, but saw no means of making this happen. The need and opportunity for a global industry alliance on ocean sustainable development became clear and compelling. Paul set out in the early 2000s to build a network of ocean-related companies concerned with the health of the marine environment and began organizing private sector panels at the biennial multi-stakeholder Global Oceans Conferences held at UNESCO. The industry panelists were energized by the opportunity to meet colleagues from other sectors who were also concerned about ocean stewardship. They encouraged Paul to expand the opportunities for a global marine industry interaction. Building on this, international Business and Industry Leaders Roundtables on Ocean Sustainability were twice convened (Lisbon, 2005; Paris, 2006), at which participants called for the creation of an ongoing structure and process for industry interaction on ocean sustainable development. With this steadily growing interest and momentum from the Ocean Business Community, the World Ocean Council was registered in early 2010 in the US as a nonprofit organization focused on working with the Ocean Business Community on ocean sustainability, science and stewardship. Numerous organizations from the diverse global Ocean Business Community interested in “Corporate Ocean Responsibility” have since signed up to become Members. The representation of various sectors and industries has allowed the WOC to have an impactful contribution to a growing number of governmental and intergovernmental bodies, and to ensure the engagement of the Ocean Business Community in ocean policy formation. The WOC organized the first international, cross-sectoral ocean industry conference on “Corporate Ocean Responsibility” in 2010, when the inaugural Sustainable Ocean Summit (SOS) was held in Belfast, Ireland. With a commitment to advancing the development and implementation of industry-driven solutions to ocean sustainability challenges, subsequent Sustainable Ocean Summits were convened in Washington DC 2013 on “Oceans 2050 — The Ocean Business Community and Sustainable Seas”, in Singapore 2015 on “Sustainable Development and Growing the Blue Economy – the Next 50 Years”, in Rotterdam 2016 on “Ocean 2030: Sustainable Development Goals and the Ocean Business Community”, in Halifax 2017 on “The Ocean Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 14): Business Leadership and Business Opportunities”, in Hong Kong 2018 on “Ocean Sustainable Development – Connecting Asia and the World”, and in Paris 2019 on “Investing in Ocean Futures: Finance and Innovation in the Blue Economy”.

OUTLAW OCEAN MUSIC PROJECT: WHERE MUSIC MEETS JOURNALISM All music in this project is based on THE OUTLAW OCEAN, a New York Times best-selling book by Ian Urbina that chronicles lawlessness at sea around the world. The reporting touches on a diversity of abuses ranging from illegal and overfishing, arms trafficking at sea, human slavery, gun-running, intentional dumping, murder of stowaways, thievery of ships, and other topics. The music is an act of solidarity across geography and language, and an attempt at storytelling from written word to music. It is a captivating collection of inspired songs. Take your pick: listen to ambient tracks, classical, electronic or hiphop.

WOSM has 172 members.[3] These members are recognized national Scout organizations, which collectively have over 50 million participants.[6] WOSM was established in 1922,[1][2] and has its operational headquarters at Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and its legal seat in Geneva, Switzerland. It is the counterpart of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS). The WOSM's current stated mission is ""to contribute to the education of young people, through a value system based on the Scout Promise and Scout Law, to help build a better world where people are self-fulfilled as individuals and play a constructive role in society"".[7][8] WOSM is organized into regions and operates with a conference, committee and bureau. The WOSM is associated with three World Scout Centres. The World Scout Jamboree is held roughly every four years under the auspices of the WOSM, with members of WAGGGS also invited. WOSM also organises the World Scout Moot, a Jamboree for 17- to 26-year-olds, and has organised the World Scout Indaba, a gathering for Scout leaders. The World Scout Foundation is a perpetual fund governed by a separate Board of Governors and supported by donations for the development of WOSM associated Scouting programs throughout the world. WOSM is a non-governmental organization with General Consultative Status to the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).[9] Contents 1 History 2 World Scout Conference 3 World Scout Committee 3.1 Current members 2021-2024 3.2 Bronze Wolf Award 4 World Scout Bureau 4.1 Location 4.2 Leadership 5 World Scout Centres 6 World Scout programmes 7 World Scout emblem 8 Recognition of non-national Scouting organizations 9 Publications 10 See also 11 References 12 Further reading 13 External links History[edit] As a result of an international conference held during the first World Scout Jamboree at Olympia, London in 1920, leaders there agreed to create a Boy Scouts International Bureau (BSIB). An office was established at 25, Buckingham Palace Road, London, and the then International Commissioner of The Boy Scouts Association of the United Kingdom, Hubert S. Martin, was appointed as Honorary Director. The first task of the bureau was to co-ordinate the discussions and to prepare a second international conference in Paris in 1922.[1][2] At the 1922 Paris conference The International Conference of the Boy Scout Movement, its committee and BSIB were constituted by the founding member organizations.[2] In 1961 The International Conference of the Boy Scout Movement reconstituted the organization introducing the name World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM). The International Conference of the Boy Scout Movement became the WOSM's World Scout Conference, its International Committee became the World Scout Committee and the Boy Scouts International Bureau became the WOSM's World Scout Bureau.[10] World Scout Conference[edit] The World Scout Conference (WSC) is the governing body and meets every three years, preceded by the World Scout Youth Forum. The World Scout Conference is the general assembly of Scouting and is composed of six delegates from each of the member Scout associations. If a country has more than one association, the associations form a federation for coordination and world representation. The basis for recognition and membership in the World Scout Conference includes adherence to the aims and principles of the World Organization of the Scout Movement, and independence from political involvement on the part of each member association.[11] The Conference meets every three years and is hosted by a member association. At the World Scout Conference basic cooperative efforts are agreed upon and a plan of mutual coordination is adopted.[12] Date Number Location Country Member Countries Host Candidate Countries 1920 Retrospectively referred to as the ""First International Conference"" London United Kingdom 33 1922 First International Conference (retrospectively referred to as the ""Second"")[2] Paris France 30 1924 Third International Conference Copenhagen Denmark 34 1926 Fourth International Conference Kandersteg Switzerland 29 1929 Fifth International Conference Birkenhead United Kingdom 33 1931 Sixth International Conference Baden bei Wien Austria 44 1933 Seventh International Conference Gödöllő Hungary 31 1935 Eighth International Conference Stockholm Sweden 28 1937 Ninth International Conference The Hague Netherlands 34 1939 10th International Conference Edinburgh United Kingdom 27 1947 11th International Conference Château de Rosny-sur-Seine France 32 1949 12th International Conference Elvesaeter Norway 25 1951 13th International Conference Salzburg Austria 34 1953 14th International Conference Vaduz Liechtenstein 35 1955 15th International Conference Niagara Falls, Ontario Canada 44 1957 16th International Conference Cambridge United Kingdom 52 1959 17th International Conference New Delhi India 35 1961 18th International Conference Lisbon Portugal[13] 50 1963 19th World Scout Conference Rhodes Greece 52 1965 20th World Scout Conference Mexico City Mexico 59 1967 21st World Scout Conference Seattle United States 70 1969 22nd World Scout Conference Espoo Finland 64 1971 23rd World Scout Conference Tokyo Japan 71 1973 24th World Scout Conference Nairobi Kenya 77 1975 25th World Scout Conference Lundtoft Denmark 87 1977 26th World Scout Conference Montreal Canada 81 1979 27th World Scout Conference Birmingham United Kingdom 81 1981 28th World Scout Conference Dakar Senegal 74 1983 29th World Scout Conference Dearborn United States 90 1985 30th World Scout Conference Munich West Germany 93 1988 31st World Scout Conference Melbourne Australia 77 1990 32nd World Scout Conference Paris France 100 1993 33rd World Scout Conference Sattahip Thailand 99 1996 34th World Scout Conference Oslo Norway 108 1999 35th World Scout Conference Durban South Africa 116 2002 36th World Scout Conference Thessaloniki Greece 125 2005 37th World Scout Conference Hammamet Tunisia 122 Hong Kong 2008 38th World Scout Conference Jeju-do South Korea 150 2011 39th World Scout Conference Curitiba Brazil 138 Australia,  Hong Kong,  Switzerland 2014 40th World Scout Conference Ljubljana Slovenia 143 Italy 2017 41st World Scout Conference Baku Azerbaijan 169[14] Malaysia 2020 42nd World Scout Conference Sharm El Sheikh Egypt Postponed Malaysia 2021 42nd World Scout Conference Digital 170[15] 2025 43rd World Scout Conference Sharm El Sheikh Egypt[16] France, Mexico World Scout Committee[edit] The World Scout Committee is the executive body of the World Scout Conference and is composed of elected volunteers and one appointed Secretary General. The World Scout Committee represents World Scout Conference between the meetings of the full conference. The World Scout Committee is responsible for the implementation of the resolutions of the World Scout Conference and for acting on its behalf between its meetings. The Committee meets twice a year, usually in Geneva. Its Steering Committee, consisting of the Chairman, two Vice-Chairmen, a Youth Advisor and the Secretary General, meet as needed.[17] The committee has 21 members. Twelve, each from a different country, are elected for three-year terms by the World Scout Conference. The members, elected without regard to their nationality, represent the interests of the movement as a whole, not those of their country. The Secretary General, the Treasurer of WOSM and a representative member of the board of the World Scout Foundation and the chairmen of the regional Scout committees are ex-officio members of the committee. The six Youth Advisors to the WSC are elected by the World Scout Youth Forum are participating in all of the WSC meetings and are also part of the governing structure between the meetings. The World Scout Committee has set up work streams to address the top strategic priorities, as defined by the World Scout Conference, which at present include: Youth involvement Volunteers in Scouting Scouting's profile (communications, partnerships, resources) Standing committees include: Audit Budget Constitutions Ethics Honours and Awards Working With Others- a consultative committee of the WOSM and the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS), composed of members of the World Committee/World Board of both organizations 2007 Task Force for the 100th Anniversary of Scouting, composed of members of the World Scout Committee, World Scout Bureau, World Scout Foundation, and The Scout Association of the United Kingdom Current members 2021-2024[edit] Name[18] Country Term to* Andy Chapman, Chairperson United States 2024 Jo Deman, Vice-Chair Belgium 2024 Sarah Rita Kattan, Vice-Chair Lebanon 2024 Mehdi Ben Khelil Tunisia 2024 Mori Chi-Kin Cheng Hong Kong 2024 Wayne Adrian Davis Ethiopia 2024 Nika Gorovska Ukraine 2024 Eun Gui Kim Korea 2024 Chrissy Pollithy Germany 2024 Daiana Neil Argentina 2024 Pia Melin Graasbøll Denmark 2024 Juan Reig Spain 2024 Ahmad Alhendawi, Secretary General Jordan[19] Joseph Lau, Treasurer Hong Kong Héctor Robledo Cervantes, Chairperson WSF Mexico 2021** Kent Clayburn, Chairperson Elect, WSF USA TBA Note: The World Scout Conference in 2008 decided that, starting at the World Conference in 2011, elected members will serve for only three years, but be eligible for re-election for one additional term. Due SARS-COV2 (COVID-19) pandemic, the World Scout Conference was rescheduled from Aug 2020 to Aug 2021. Bronze Wolf Award[edit] The Bronze Wolf Award is the only distinction awarded by WOSM, awarded by the World Scout Committee for exceptional services to world Scouting. It was first awarded to Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell by a unanimous decision of the then-International Committee on the day of the institution of the Bronze Wolf in Stockholm in 1935. World Scout Bureau[edit] The World Scout Bureau is headquartered in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and has offices in six regional divisions:   European Region: Geneva, Switzerland; Brussels, Belgium and Belgrade, Serbia   Arab Region: Cairo, Egypt   Africa Region: Nairobi, Kenya; Cape Town, South Africa; and Dakar, Senegal   Asia-Pacific Region: Makati, Philippines; Australia; Nepal[citation needed]; and Tokyo, Japan   Interamerican Region: Ciudad del Saber, Panama   Eurasian Region: Kyiv, Ukraine   grey areas such as North Korea, Laos and Cuba have no Scouting The World Scout Bureau (WSB, formerly the International Bureau) is the secretariat that carries out the instructions of the World Scout Conference and the World Scout Committee. The WSB is administered by the secretary general, who is supported by a small staff of technical resource personnel. The bureau staff helps associations improve and broaden their Scouting by training professionals and volunteers, establishing finance policies and money-raising techniques, improving community facilities and procedures, and assisting in marshaling the national resources of each country behind Scouting.[11] The staff also helps arrange global events such as the World Scout Jamborees, encourages regional events, and acts as a liaison between the Scouting Movement and other international organizations. A major effort in the emerging nations is the extension of the universal Good Turn into an organization-wide effort for community development.[20] Location[edit] The Bureau was first established in London, England in 1920 and moved to Ottawa, Ontario, Canada in 1959. The International Conference directed the move of the Bureau from Ottawa to Geneva on 1 May 1968.[21] In August 2013, WOSM announced the relocation of the World Scout Bureau Central Office (WSB-CO) to Kuala Lumpur where it is now located.[22] Leadership[edit] This list includes Secretaries General ||and their deputies from the World Organization of the Scout Movement and members of the World Scout Bureau. From 1920 to 1968, this function was called Director Title Years Name Country Director 1920-1938 Hubert S.

World Scout programmes[edit] The Better World Framework combines the Scouts of the World Award, Messengers of Peace and World Scout Environment Programmes as programme initiatives administered by the World Scout Bureau. [24] World Scout emblem[edit] 1939-1955 version of the World Scout Emblem, used by the Boy Scouts International Bureau and International Committee members The WOSM emblem and membership badge is the World Scout Emblem, a purple, circular logo with a fleur-de-lis in the center, surrounded by a length of rope tied with a reef knot (also called a square knot). Baden-Powell used a fleur-de-lis badge awarded to British Army scouts and subsequently adopted and modified the badge for Scouting. The arrowhead represents the North point on a compass, and is intended to point Scouts on the path to service and unity. The three points on the fleur-de-lis represent the three parts of the Scout Promise: - service to others, duty to God and obedience to the Scout Law.[25] The two five-point stars stand for truth and knowledge, with the ten points representing the ten points of the Scout Law. The bond at the base of the fleur-de-lis symbolizes the family of Scouting. The encircling rope symbolizes the unity and family of the World Scout Movement. Recognition of non-national Scouting organizations[edit] The needs of Scout youth in unusual situations has created some interesting permutations, answerable directly to the World Scout Bureau. These permutations fall generally into three categories: ""National"" Movements not operating within the boundaries of their original homelands, such as the Russian and Armenian exile groups;[10] Small, non-voting associations basically viewed by the BSIB as ""councils"", such as the Boy Scouts of the United Nations and the International Boy Scouts of the Canal Zone[26] The less well-known directly registered ""mixed-nationality Troops"". Both the Boy Scouts of United Nations and the International Boy Scouts of the Canal Zone have long since disbanded, and the only remaining directly registered Troop is the International Boy Scouts, Troop 1 located in Yokohama, Japan. In addition to these three groups a temporary recognition was extended by the BSIB to Scouts in displaced persons camps after World War II. In 1947 at the 11th International Conference the ""Displaced Persons Division"" of the BSIB was established to register and support Scouts in displaced person camps in Austria, Northern Italy, and Germany.[27] These Scouts did not receive the right of membership in the Boy Scouts International Conference but gained recognition as Scouts under the protection of the Bureau until they took up residence in a country that had a recognized National Scouting Organization, which they then could join.[28] The D.P. Division was closed on 30 June 1950.[29] The International Conference of the Boy Scout Movement decided to admit and recognise the exile Russian Scout group as the ""Representatives of Russian Scouting in Foreign Countries"" on 30 August 1922 and the Armenian Scouts in France were recognized as a ""National Movement on Foreign Soil"" on 30 April 1929.[10] The Boy Scouts of the United Nations began in 1945, and for years there was an active Boy Scouts of the United Nations with several troops at Parkway Village in New York City, with but 14 members in 1959. The International Boy Scouts of the Canal Zone, a group in Panama with Scouts that claimed British and not Panamanian nationality was originally placed under the American Scouting overseas of the BSA but, in 1947, was transferred under the International Bureau. In 1957 the group had over 900 members and existed as a directly registered group until the late 60s. The third category in the directly registered groups, the ""mixed-nationality troops"", were registered after discussions concerning such troops took place at the 3rd International Conference of 1924[30] at which the BSIB was authorized to directly register such groups. It seems that the discussion at the 1924 International Conference was, at least in part, prompted by a letter to Baden-Powell from the Scoutmaster of one such troop in Yokohama, Japan.[31] Janning's troop became the first troop directly registered by the BSIB.[32] Only a few troops were directly registered as soon the practice was discontinued and new ""mixed"" groups were encouraged to join the National Scout Association of their country of residence. In 1955 only two such groups were still active, a troop in Iraq that disbanded that year,[33] and the first group to be registered, the International Troop 1 in Yokohama.[34] The international troop in Yokohama is the only remaining active troop of the small group of the originally directly registered mixed-nationality troops.[35] Publications[edit] Publications of WOSM include: Scouting 'Round the World: a book updated every three years with details on all WOSM member organizations; WorldInfo: a monthly circular distributed in electronic format with the help of Scoutnet.

You are hereHome / National Scout Organizations National Scout Organizations Scouting is a global movement with over 54 million Scouts worldwide, all part of recognised National Scout Organizations (NSOs) of WOSM (also known as Member Organizations). The role of the NSO is to support and develop Scouting in that country, and facilitate contacts with other NSOs and the World Organization. To become a member of WOSM, NSOs must gain recognition from the World Scout Conference. There can only be one NSO per country. In the case of a country having more than one National Scout Association (NSA), a federation is formed for the purpose of national coordination and world membership. There are currently 172 Member Organizations in the world. In addition to the 172 Member Organizations, local Scouting activities exist in at least another 52 countries and territories worldwide. List of National Scout Organizations Membership figures Below you can find the membership census as of the World Organization of the Scout Movement. In some countries, the National Scout Organization may be larger than indicated, where girls and women are registered only as members of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS). WOSM Membership Census Scouting Elsewhere Main Territories There are 38 main territories where Scouting exists, often as overseas branches of member NSOs: Aland Islands, Anguilla, Antarctica, Bermuda, Bonaire-Saint Eustatius and Saba, Bouvet Island, British Indian Ocean Territory, British Virgin Island, Cayman Islands, Christmas Islands, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Falkland Islands (Malvinas), Faroe Islands, French Guiana, Gibraltar, Greenland, Guadeloupe, Guam, Head Island and McDonald Islands, Martinique, Mayotte, Montserrat, New Caledonia, Norfolk Island, Pitcairn, Réunion, Saint Barthelemy, Saint Helena, Saint Martin, Saint Pierre & Miquelon, Sint Maarten, South Georgia and the South Sandwich, Svalbard and Jan Mayen, Turks and Caicos Islands, US Minor Outlying Islands, U.S. Virgin Islands, Wallis and Futuna Potential Member Countries There are 14 countries where Scouting exists (be it embryonic or widespread) but where there is no National Scout Organization which is yet a member of WOSM.

You are hereHome / World Scouting World Scouting The Scout Movement is a voluntary non-political educational movement for young people, open to all without distinction of gender, origin, race or creed. Scouting offers young people the opportunity to develop their full emotional, intellectual, physical, social and spiritual potentials as individuals, as responsible global citizens, and as members of their local, national and international communities. The organization of the Scout Movement at the world level, “World Scouting”, is governed by the World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM). WOSM is an independent, non-political, non-governmental organisation that is made up of 164 National Scout Organizations (NSOs). These NSOs are located in 224 countries and territories around the world. With over 40 million members in some one million local community Scout Groups, WOSM is one of the largest youth movements in the world. Some seven million members in WOSM are adult volunteers who support local activities. Through peer-to-peer leadership, supported by adults, each local Scout Group embraces the same set of values illustrated in the Scout Promise and Law. Each of the one million local Scout Groups follows a similar system of non-formal education suited to the unique aspects of their local community. Purpose The purpose of WOSM is to promote unity and the understanding of Scouting's purpose and principles while facilitating its expansion and development. The organs of WOSM are the World Scout Conference, the World Scout Committee, and the World Scout Bureau.

WOSM has 172 members.[3] These members are recognized national Scout organizations, which collectively have over 50 million participants.[6] WOSM was established in 1922,[1][2] and has its operational headquarters at Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and its legal seat in Geneva, Switzerland. It is the counterpart of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS). The WOSM's current stated mission is ""to contribute to the education of young people, through a value system based on the Scout Promise and Scout Law, to help build a better world where people are self-fulfilled as individuals and play a constructive role in society"".[7][8] WOSM is organized into regions and operates with a conference, committee and bureau. The WOSM is associated with three World Scout Centres. The World Scout Jamboree is held roughly every four years under the auspices of the WOSM, with members of WAGGGS also invited. WOSM also organises the World Scout Moot, a Jamboree for 17- to 26-year-olds, and has organised the World Scout Indaba, a gathering for Scout leaders. The World Scout Foundation is a perpetual fund governed by a separate Board of Governors and supported by donations for the development of WOSM associated Scouting programs throughout the world. WOSM is a non-governmental organization with General Consultative Status to the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).[9] Contents 1 History 2 World Scout Conference 3 World Scout Committee 3.1 Current members 2021-2024 3.2 Bronze Wolf Award 4 World Scout Bureau 4.1 Location 4.2 Leadership 5 World Scout Centres 6 World Scout programmes 7 World Scout emblem 8 Recognition of non-national Scouting organizations 9 Publications 10 See also 11 References 12 Further reading 13 External links History[edit] As a result of an international conference held during the first World Scout Jamboree at Olympia, London in 1920, leaders there agreed to create a Boy Scouts International Bureau (BSIB). An office was established at 25, Buckingham Palace Road, London, and the then International Commissioner of The Boy Scouts Association of the United Kingdom, Hubert S. Martin, was appointed as Honorary Director. The first task of the bureau was to co-ordinate the discussions and to prepare a second international conference in Paris in 1922.[1][2] At the 1922 Paris conference The International Conference of the Boy Scout Movement, its committee and BSIB were constituted by the founding member organizations.[2] In 1961 The International Conference of the Boy Scout Movement reconstituted the organization introducing the name World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM). The International Conference of the Boy Scout Movement became the WOSM's World Scout Conference, its International Committee became the World Scout Committee and the Boy Scouts International Bureau became the WOSM's World Scout Bureau.[10] World Scout Conference[edit] The World Scout Conference (WSC) is the governing body and meets every three years, preceded by the World Scout Youth Forum. The World Scout Conference is the general assembly of Scouting and is composed of six delegates from each of the member Scout associations. If a country has more than one association, the associations form a federation for coordination and world representation. The basis for recognition and membership in the World Scout Conference includes adherence to the aims and principles of the World Organization of the Scout Movement, and independence from political involvement on the part of each member association.[11] The Conference meets every three years and is hosted by a member association. At the World Scout Conference basic cooperative efforts are agreed upon and a plan of mutual coordination is adopted.[12] Date Number Location Country Member Countries Host Candidate Countries 1920 Retrospectively referred to as the ""First International Conference"" London United Kingdom 33 1922 First International Conference (retrospectively referred to as the ""Second"")[2] Paris France 30 1924 Third International Conference Copenhagen Denmark 34 1926 Fourth International Conference Kandersteg Switzerland 29 1929 Fifth International Conference Birkenhead United Kingdom 33 1931 Sixth International Conference Baden bei Wien Austria 44 1933 Seventh International Conference Gödöllő Hungary 31 1935 Eighth International Conference Stockholm Sweden 28 1937 Ninth International Conference The Hague Netherlands 34 1939 10th International Conference Edinburgh United Kingdom 27 1947 11th International Conference Château de Rosny-sur-Seine France 32 1949 12th International Conference Elvesaeter Norway 25 1951 13th International Conference Salzburg Austria 34 1953 14th International Conference Vaduz Liechtenstein 35 1955 15th International Conference Niagara Falls, Ontario Canada 44 1957 16th International Conference Cambridge United Kingdom 52 1959 17th International Conference New Delhi India 35 1961 18th International Conference Lisbon Portugal[13] 50 1963 19th World Scout Conference Rhodes Greece 52 1965 20th World Scout Conference Mexico City Mexico 59 1967 21st World Scout Conference Seattle United States 70 1969 22nd World Scout Conference Espoo Finland 64 1971 23rd World Scout Conference Tokyo Japan 71 1973 24th World Scout Conference Nairobi Kenya 77 1975 25th World Scout Conference Lundtoft Denmark 87 1977 26th World Scout Conference Montreal Canada 81 1979 27th World Scout Conference Birmingham United Kingdom 81 1981 28th World Scout Conference Dakar Senegal 74 1983 29th World Scout Conference Dearborn United States 90 1985 30th World Scout Conference Munich West Germany 93 1988 31st World Scout Conference Melbourne Australia 77 1990 32nd World Scout Conference Paris France 100 1993 33rd World Scout Conference Sattahip Thailand 99 1996 34th World Scout Conference Oslo Norway 108 1999 35th World Scout Conference Durban South Africa 116 2002 36th World Scout Conference Thessaloniki Greece 125 2005 37th World Scout Conference Hammamet Tunisia 122 Hong Kong 2008 38th World Scout Conference Jeju-do South Korea 150 2011 39th World Scout Conference Curitiba Brazil 138 Australia,  Hong Kong,  Switzerland 2014 40th World Scout Conference Ljubljana Slovenia 143 Italy 2017 41st World Scout Conference Baku Azerbaijan 169[14] Malaysia 2020 42nd World Scout Conference Sharm El Sheikh Egypt Postponed Malaysia 2021 42nd World Scout Conference Digital 170[15] 2025 43rd World Scout Conference Sharm El Sheikh Egypt[16] France, Mexico World Scout Committee[edit] The World Scout Committee is the executive body of the World Scout Conference and is composed of elected volunteers and one appointed Secretary General. The World Scout Committee represents World Scout Conference between the meetings of the full conference. The World Scout Committee is responsible for the implementation of the resolutions of the World Scout Conference and for acting on its behalf between its meetings. The Committee meets twice a year, usually in Geneva. Its Steering Committee, consisting of the Chairman, two Vice-Chairmen, a Youth Advisor and the Secretary General, meet as needed.[17] The committee has 21 members. Twelve, each from a different country, are elected for three-year terms by the World Scout Conference. The members, elected without regard to their nationality, represent the interests of the movement as a whole, not those of their country. The Secretary General, the Treasurer of WOSM and a representative member of the board of the World Scout Foundation and the chairmen of the regional Scout committees are ex-officio members of the committee. The six Youth Advisors to the WSC are elected by the World Scout Youth Forum are participating in all of the WSC meetings and are also part of the governing structure between the meetings. The World Scout Committee has set up work streams to address the top strategic priorities, as defined by the World Scout Conference, which at present include: Youth involvement Volunteers in Scouting Scouting's profile (communications, partnerships, resources) Standing committees include: Audit Budget Constitutions Ethics Honours and Awards Working With Others- a consultative committee of the WOSM and the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS), composed of members of the World Committee/World Board of both organizations 2007 Task Force for the 100th Anniversary of Scouting, composed of members of the World Scout Committee, World Scout Bureau, World Scout Foundation, and The Scout Association of the United Kingdom Current members 2021-2024[edit] Name[18] Country Term to* Andy Chapman, Chairperson United States 2024 Jo Deman, Vice-Chair Belgium 2024 Sarah Rita Kattan, Vice-Chair Lebanon 2024 Mehdi Ben Khelil Tunisia 2024 Mori Chi-Kin Cheng Hong Kong 2024 Wayne Adrian Davis Ethiopia 2024 Nika Gorovska Ukraine 2024 Eun Gui Kim Korea 2024 Chrissy Pollithy Germany 2024 Daiana Neil Argentina 2024 Pia Melin Graasbøll Denmark 2024 Juan Reig Spain 2024 Ahmad Alhendawi, Secretary General Jordan[19] Joseph Lau, Treasurer Hong Kong Héctor Robledo Cervantes, Chairperson WSF Mexico 2021** Kent Clayburn, Chairperson Elect, WSF USA TBA Note: The World Scout Conference in 2008 decided that, starting at the World Conference in 2011, elected members will serve for only three years, but be eligible for re-election for one additional term. Due SARS-COV2 (COVID-19) pandemic, the World Scout Conference was rescheduled from Aug 2020 to Aug 2021. Bronze Wolf Award[edit] The Bronze Wolf Award is the only distinction awarded by WOSM, awarded by the World Scout Committee for exceptional services to world Scouting. It was first awarded to Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell by a unanimous decision of the then-International Committee on the day of the institution of the Bronze Wolf in Stockholm in 1935. World Scout Bureau[edit] The World Scout Bureau is headquartered in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and has offices in six regional divisions:   European Region: Geneva, Switzerland; Brussels, Belgium and Belgrade, Serbia   Arab Region: Cairo, Egypt   Africa Region: Nairobi, Kenya; Cape Town, South Africa; and Dakar, Senegal   Asia-Pacific Region: Makati, Philippines; Australia; Nepal[citation needed]; and Tokyo, Japan   Interamerican Region: Ciudad del Saber, Panama   Eurasian Region: Kyiv, Ukraine   grey areas such as North Korea, Laos and Cuba have no Scouting The World Scout Bureau (WSB, formerly the International Bureau) is the secretariat that carries out the instructions of the World Scout Conference and the World Scout Committee. The WSB is administered by the secretary general, who is supported by a small staff of technical resource personnel. The bureau staff helps associations improve and broaden their Scouting by training professionals and volunteers, establishing finance policies and money-raising techniques, improving community facilities and procedures, and assisting in marshaling the national resources of each country behind Scouting.[11] The staff also helps arrange global events such as the World Scout Jamborees, encourages regional events, and acts as a liaison between the Scouting Movement and other international organizations. A major effort in the emerging nations is the extension of the universal Good Turn into an organization-wide effort for community development.[20] Location[edit] The Bureau was first established in London, England in 1920 and moved to Ottawa, Ontario, Canada in 1959. The International Conference directed the move of the Bureau from Ottawa to Geneva on 1 May 1968.[21] In August 2013, WOSM announced the relocation of the World Scout Bureau Central Office (WSB-CO) to Kuala Lumpur where it is now located.[22] Leadership[edit] This list includes Secretaries General ||and their deputies from the World Organization of the Scout Movement and members of the World Scout Bureau.

World Scout programmes[edit] The Better World Framework combines the Scouts of the World Award, Messengers of Peace and World Scout Environment Programmes as programme initiatives administered by the World Scout Bureau. [24] World Scout emblem[edit] 1939-1955 version of the World Scout Emblem, used by the Boy Scouts International Bureau and International Committee members The WOSM emblem and membership badge is the World Scout Emblem, a purple, circular logo with a fleur-de-lis in the center, surrounded by a length of rope tied with a reef knot (also called a square knot). Baden-Powell used a fleur-de-lis badge awarded to British Army scouts and subsequently adopted and modified the badge for Scouting. The arrowhead represents the North point on a compass, and is intended to point Scouts on the path to service and unity. The three points on the fleur-de-lis represent the three parts of the Scout Promise: - service to others, duty to God and obedience to the Scout Law.[25] The two five-point stars stand for truth and knowledge, with the ten points representing the ten points of the Scout Law. The bond at the base of the fleur-de-lis symbolizes the family of Scouting. The encircling rope symbolizes the unity and family of the World Scout Movement. Recognition of non-national Scouting organizations[edit] The needs of Scout youth in unusual situations has created some interesting permutations, answerable directly to the World Scout Bureau. These permutations fall generally into three categories: ""National"" Movements not operating within the boundaries of their original homelands, such as the Russian and Armenian exile groups;[10] Small, non-voting associations basically viewed by the BSIB as ""councils"", such as the Boy Scouts of the United Nations and the International Boy Scouts of the Canal Zone[26] The less well-known directly registered ""mixed-nationality Troops"". Both the Boy Scouts of United Nations and the International Boy Scouts of the Canal Zone have long since disbanded, and the only remaining directly registered Troop is the International Boy Scouts, Troop 1 located in Yokohama, Japan. In addition to these three groups a temporary recognition was extended by the BSIB to Scouts in displaced persons camps after World War II. In 1947 at the 11th International Conference the ""Displaced Persons Division"" of the BSIB was established to register and support Scouts in displaced person camps in Austria, Northern Italy, and Germany.[27] These Scouts did not receive the right of membership in the Boy Scouts International Conference but gained recognition as Scouts under the protection of the Bureau until they took up residence in a country that had a recognized National Scouting Organization, which they then could join.[28] The D.P. Division was closed on 30 June 1950.[29] The International Conference of the Boy Scout Movement decided to admit and recognise the exile Russian Scout group as the ""Representatives of Russian Scouting in Foreign Countries"" on 30 August 1922 and the Armenian Scouts in France were recognized as a ""National Movement on Foreign Soil"" on 30 April 1929.[10] The Boy Scouts of the United Nations began in 1945, and for years there was an active Boy Scouts of the United Nations with several troops at Parkway Village in New York City, with but 14 members in 1959. The International Boy Scouts of the Canal Zone, a group in Panama with Scouts that claimed British and not Panamanian nationality was originally placed under the American Scouting overseas of the BSA but, in 1947, was transferred under the International Bureau. In 1957 the group had over 900 members and existed as a directly registered group until the late 60s. The third category in the directly registered groups, the ""mixed-nationality troops"", were registered after discussions concerning such troops took place at the 3rd International Conference of 1924[30] at which the BSIB was authorized to directly register such groups. It seems that the discussion at the 1924 International Conference was, at least in part, prompted by a letter to Baden-Powell from the Scoutmaster of one such troop in Yokohama, Japan.[31] Janning's troop became the first troop directly registered by the BSIB.[32] Only a few troops were directly registered as soon the practice was discontinued and new ""mixed"" groups were encouraged to join the National Scout Association of their country of residence. In 1955 only two such groups were still active, a troop in Iraq that disbanded that year,[33] and the first group to be registered, the International Troop 1 in Yokohama.[34] The international troop in Yokohama is the only remaining active troop of the small group of the originally directly registered mixed-nationality troops.[35] Publications[edit] Publications of WOSM include: Scouting 'Round the World: a book updated every three years with details on all WOSM member organizations; WorldInfo: a monthly circular distributed in electronic format with the help of Scoutnet.

By: Express Web Desk | Bengaluru | Updated: September 2, 2021 7:39:19 am Anjum Parwez, Managing Director, BMRCL, said, “The move will facilitate mobility and development along the Phase 2A and 2B Metro rail corridors.""(File) The Namma Metro has now engaged World Resources Institute (WRI India) as its technical advisors for the Phase 2A and Phase 2B projects for Multimodal Integration (MMI) and Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) along the two Metro corridors. According to BMRCL, WRI India is a global research organisation focusing on building sustainable, liveable cities and working towards a low-carbon economy. “The initiative seeks to bridge Bengaluru’s disconnect between mass transit infrastructure and unprecedented growth. TOD will help redirect growth along its rail transit corridor enabling walkable and connected neighbourhoods. MMI compliments this effort by providing a seamless and accessible urban transportation system that includes private as well as public modes of transit. Together, TOD and MMI aim to enhance accessibility and livability, making the city resource-efficient and reducing carbon footprints in the process,” BMRCL said in a statement.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png The decision was taken to engage with the World Resources Institute in the round table discussions on TOD and MMI for Bengaluru’s Metro Rail Corridors held on August 26, 27 and 31. Asian Development Bank (ADB) has financially assisted Bengaluru Metro for its Phase-2A (Silk Board to K R Puram) and 2B (K R Puram to KIA) projects and also provided technical assistance for TOD.

Ample, clean water is vital for human health, industry, agriculture and energy production. Yet the world’s water systems face formidable threats due to unsustainable management and climate change. As many as 3.5 billion people could experience water scarcity by 2025, while demand is projected to grow by up to 30% by 2050. Water-related conflicts and political instability are on the rise. And climate change is worsening the problem, intensifying floods and droughts, shifting precipitation patterns and fueling sea level rise. Already, 90% of natural disasters from 1995-2015 were water- or heat-related. 1% of global GDP could provide water security for all by 2030 25% of the global population lives in countries facing extremely high water stress $1T Flooding caused more than $1 trillion in losses globally since 1980 70% of the water humans use goes to food production Our Approach WRI works with countries, cities and companies to build a water-secure future. We produce innovative data and analysis tools to help decision-makers understand current and future water risks. We identify ways for policymakers to build water resilience, prevent water-related conflicts and invest in nature-based solutions. We guide companies on water stewardship initiatives that can reduce financial risk and improve collective water security. And we work with cities to expand water access and address the root problems of water insecurity to create more resilient communities.

It consists of 50 states, a federal district, five major unincorporated territories, 326 Indian reservations, and some minor possessions.[j] At 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million square kilometers), it is the world's third- or fourth-largest country by total area.[d] The United States shares significant land borders with Canada to the north and Mexico to the south, as well as limited maritime borders with the Bahamas, Cuba, and Russia.[22] With a population of more than 331 million people, it is the third most populous country in the world. The national capital is Washington, D.C., and the most populous city is New York. Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago, and European colonization began in the 16th century. The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast. Disputes over taxation and political representation with Great Britain led to the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), which established independence. Four years after achieving independence the US underwent a constitutional shift by ratifying the US Constitution in 1788. In the early 18th century, the U.S. began expanding across North America, gradually obtaining new territories, sometimes through war, frequently displacing Native Americans, and admitting new states; by 1848, the United States spanned the continent. Slavery was legal in the southern United States until the second half of the 19th century when the issue sparked the American Civil War which led to its abolition. When the war concluded in 1865 the federal government firmly cemented its role of supremacy over the states, shifting the balance of power that would maintain to this day. The war also saw the rapid expansion of American industrial capabilities and America became both a scientific and industrial juggernaut. America's foreign policy became built upon establishing an empire of its own which it confirmed after the Spanish–American War. Victory in the First World War would confirm the US as a world power and would further intertwine the US and Europe both diplomatically and economically. The inter-war years saw the United States adopt a new identity culturally. Baseball, movie going, and Jazz all experienced popularity in the 1920s and 30s. In 1941 the United States formally entered the Second World War as a member of the Allied powers following a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. During World War Two America underwent an unparalleled transformation that saw the rapid expansion of its military, scientific, and industrial might. It also undertook the Manhattan Project, a top secret effort to develop the Atomic Bomb. The United States exited the war as a superpower and the only nation thus far to have the atomic bomb. It played an extensive role in establishing the post-war order such as the creation of the United Nations and drafting the 1947 Constitution of Japan. In the aftermath of the Second World War, the US aggressively pursued a foreign policy agenda against the Soviet Union starting the Cold War. This foreign policy escalated the pressure on the Soviets to develop their own nuclear arsenal. The Cold War evolved into potential of nuclear war when in 1949 the Soviet Union detonated its first atomic weapon. During the Cold War, the United States fought the Soviet allies in the Korean War and the Vietnam War but avoided direct military conflict with the Soviet Union itself. The Space Race which was an aspect of the Cold War, that culminated in the Apollo 11 mission which saw the United States land the first man on the Moon. The Soviet Union's dissolution in 1991 ended the Cold War, leaving the United States as the world's sole superpower for the next two decades. In the 21st century, the United States has increasingly been challenged by the People's Republic of China for global dominance. The United States is a federal republic and a representative democracy with three separate branches of government, including a bicameral legislature. It is a founding member of the United Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, Organization of American States, NATO, and other international organizations. It is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. Considered a melting pot of cultures and ethnicities, its population has been profoundly shaped by centuries of immigration. The country ranks high in international measures of economic freedom, quality of life, education, and human rights, and has low levels of perceived corruption. However, the country has received criticism concerning inequality related to race, wealth and income, the use of capital punishment, high incarceration rates, and lack of universal health care. The United States is a highly developed country, accounts for approximately a quarter of global GDP, and is the world's largest economy. By value, the United States is the world's largest importer and the second-largest exporter of goods. Although its population is only 4.2% of the world's total, it holds 29.4% of the total wealth in the world, the largest share held by any country. Making up more than a third of global military spending, it is the foremost military power in the world; and it is a leading political, cultural, and scientific force internationally.[23] Contents 1 Etymology 2 History 2.1 Indigenous peoples and pre-Columbian history 2.2 European settlements 2.3 Independence and expansion 2.4 Civil War and Reconstruction era 2.5 Further immigration, expansion, and industrialization 2.6 World War I, Great Depression, and World War II 2.7 Cold War and civil rights era 2.8 Contemporary history 3 Geography 3.1 Wildlife and conservation 4 Demographics 4.1 Population 4.2 Language 4.3 Religion 4.4 Health 4.5 Education 5 Government and politics 5.1 Political divisions 5.2 Parties and elections 5.3 Foreign relations 5.4 Government finance 5.5 Military 5.6 Law enforcement and crime 6 Economy 6.1 Science and technology 6.2 Income, wealth, and poverty 7 Infrastructure 7.1 Transportation 7.2 Energy 8 Culture 8.1 Literature, philosophy, and visual art 8.2 Food 8.3 Music 8.4 Cinema 8.5 Sports 8.6 Mass media 9 See also 10 Notes 11 References 12 Further reading 13 External links Etymology See also: Naming of the Americas, Names of the United States, Names for United States citizens, and American (word) The first known use of the name ""America"" dates back to 1507, when it appeared on a world map produced by the German cartographer Martin Waldseemüller. On his map, the name is shown in large letters on what would now be considered South America, in honor of Amerigo Vespucci. The Italian explorer was the first to postulate that the West Indies did not represent Asia's eastern limit but were part of a previously unknown landmass.[24][25] In 1538, the Flemish cartographer Gerardus Mercator used the name ""America"" on his own world map, applying it to the entire Western Hemisphere.[26] The first documentary evidence of the phrase ""United States of America"" dates from a January 2, 1776 letter written by Stephen Moylan to George Washington's aide-de-camp Joseph Reed. Moylan expressed his wish to go ""with full and ample powers from the United States of America to Spain"" to seek assistance in the revolutionary war effort.[27][28][29] The first known publication of the phrase ""United States of America"" was in an anonymous essay in The Virginia Gazette newspaper in Williamsburg, Virginia, on April 6, 1776.[30] The second draft of the Articles of Confederation, prepared by John Dickinson and completed no later than June 17, 1776, declared ""The name of this Confederation shall be the 'United States of America'.""[31] The final version of the Articles, sent to the states for ratification in late 1777, stated that ""The Stile of this Confederacy shall be 'The United States of America'.""[32] In June 1776, Thomas Jefferson wrote the phrase ""UNITED STATES OF AMERICA"" in all capitalized letters in the headline of his ""original Rough draught"" of the Declaration of Independence.[31] This draft of the document did not surface until June 21, 1776, and it is unclear whether it was written before or after Dickinson used the term in his June 17 draft of the Articles of Confederation.[31] The short form ""United States"" is also standard. Other common forms are the ""U.S."", the ""USA"", and ""America"". Colloquial names are the ""U.S. of A."" and, internationally, the ""States"". ""Columbia"", a name popular in American poetry and songs of the late 18th century, derives its origin from Christopher Columbus; both ""Columbus"" and ""Columbia"" appear frequently in U.S. place-names, including Columbus, Ohio, Columbia, South Carolina, and the District of Columbia. Places and institutions throughout the Western Hemisphere bear the two names, including Colón, Panama, the country of Colombia, the Columbia River, and Columbia University. The phrase ""United States"" was originally plural in American usage. It described a collection of states—e.g., ""the United States are."" The singular form became popular after the end of the Civil War and is now standard usage in the U.S. A citizen of the United States is an ""American"". ""United States"", ""American"" and ""U.S."" refer to the country adjectivally (""American values"", ""U.S. forces""). In English, the word ""American"" rarely refers to topics or subjects not directly connected with the United States.[33] History Main articles: History of the United States and Outline of United States history Indigenous peoples and pre-Columbian history Further information: Native Americans in the United States, Prehistory of the United States, and Pre-Columbian era The Cliff Palace, built by the Native American Puebloans between AD 1190 and 1260 It has been generally accepted that the first inhabitants of North America migrated from Siberia by way of the Bering land bridge and arrived at least 12,000 years ago; however, some evidence suggests an even earlier date of arrival.[34][35][36] The Clovis culture, which appeared around 11,000 BC, is believed to represent the first wave of human settlement of the Americas.[37][38] This was likely the first of three major waves of migration into North America; later waves brought the ancestors of present-day Athabaskans, Aleuts, and Eskimos.[39] Over time, indigenous cultures in North America grew increasingly complex, and some, such as the pre-Columbian Mississippian culture in the southeast, developed advanced agriculture, architecture, and complex societies.[40] The city-state of Cahokia is the largest, most complex pre-Columbian archaeological site in the modern-day United States.[41] In the Four Corners region, Ancestral Puebloan culture developed from centuries of agricultural experimentation.[42] The Haudenosaunee, located in the southern Great Lakes region, was established at some point between the twelfth and fifteenth centuries.[43] Most prominent along the Atlantic coast were the Algonquian tribes, who practiced hunting and trapping, along with limited cultivation. Estimating the native population of North America at the time of European contact is difficult.[44][45] Douglas H. Ubelaker of the Smithsonian Institution estimated that there was a population of 92,916 in the south Atlantic states and a population of 473,616 in the Gulf states,[46] but most academics regard this figure as too low.[44] Anthropologist Henry F. Dobyns believed the populations were much higher, suggesting around 1.1 million along the shores of the Gulf of Mexico, 2.2 million people living between Florida and Massachusetts, 5.2 million in the Mississippi Valley and tributaries, and around 700,000 people in the Florida peninsula.[44][45] European settlements Further information: Colonial history of the United States and Thirteen Colonies Claims of very early colonization of coastal New England by the Norse are disputed and controversial. The first documented arrival of Europeans in the continental United States is that of Spanish conquistadors such as Juan Ponce de León, who made his first expedition to Florida in 1513. Even earlier, Christopher Columbus had landed in Puerto Rico on his 1493 voyage, and San Juan was settled by the Spanish a decade later.[47] The Spanish set up the first settlements in Florida and New Mexico, such as Saint Augustine, often considered the nation's oldest city,[48] and Santa Fe. The French established their own settlements along the Mississippi River, notably New Orleans.[49] Successful English settlement of the eastern coast of North America began with the Virginia Colony in 1607 at Jamestown and with the Pilgrims' colony at Plymouth in 1620.[50][51] The continent's first elected legislative assembly, Virginia's House of Burgesses, was founded in 1619. Documents such as the Mayflower Compact and the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut established precedents for representative self-government and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the American colonies.[52][53] Many settlers were dissenting Christians who came seeking religious freedom. In 1784, the Russians were the first Europeans to establish a settlement in Alaska, at Three Saints Bay. Russian America once spanned much of the present-day state of Alaska.[54] In the early days of colonization, many European settlers were subject to food shortages, disease, and attacks from Native Americans. Native Americans were also often at war with neighboring tribes and European settlers. In many cases, however, the natives and settlers came to depend on one another. Settlers traded for food and animal pelts; natives for guns, tools and other European goods.[55] Natives taught many settlers to cultivate corn, beans, and other foodstuffs. European missionaries and others felt it was important to ""civilize"" the Native Americans and urged them to adopt European agricultural practices and lifestyles.[56][57] However, with the increased European colonization of North America, the Native Americans were displaced and often killed.[58] The native population of America declined after European arrival for various reasons,[59][60][61] primarily diseases such as smallpox and measles.[62][63] The original Thirteen Colonies (shown in red) in 1775 European settlers also began trafficking of African slaves into Colonial America via the transatlantic slave trade.[64] Because of a lower prevalence of tropical diseases and better treatment, slaves had a much higher life expectancy in North America than in South America, leading to a rapid increase in their numbers.[65][66] Colonial society was largely divided over the religious and moral implications of slavery, and several colonies passed acts both against and in favor of the practice.[67][68] However, by the turn of the 18th century, African slaves had supplanted European indentured servants as cash crop labor, especially in the American South.[69] The Thirteen Colonies (New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia) that would become the United States of America were administered by the British as overseas dependencies.[70] All nonetheless had local governments with elections open to most free men.[71] With extremely high birth rates, low death rates, and steady settlement, the colonial population grew rapidly, eclipsing Native American populations.[72] The Christian revivalist movement of the 1730s and 1740s known as the Great Awakening fueled interest both in religion and in religious liberty.[73] During the Seven Years' War (1756–1763), known in the U.S. as the French and Indian War, British forces captured Canada from the French. With the creation of the Province of Quebec, Canada's francophone population would remain isolated from the English-speaking colonial dependencies of Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and the Thirteen Colonies. Excluding the Native Americans who lived there, the Thirteen Colonies had a population of over 2.1 million in 1770, about a third that of Britain. Despite continuing new arrivals, the rate of natural increase was such that by the 1770s only a small minority of Americans had been born overseas.[74] The colonies' distance from Britain had allowed the development of self-government, but their unprecedented success motivated British monarchs to periodically seek to reassert royal authority.[75] Independence and expansion Further information: American Revolution and Territorial evolution of the United States Declaration of Independence, painting by John Trumbull, depicts the Committee of Five presenting their draft of the Declaration to the Continental Congress, July 4, 1776 The American Revolutionary War fought by the Thirteen Colonies against the British Empire was the first successful war of independence by a non-European entity against a European power in modern history. Americans had developed an ideology of ""republicanism"", asserting that government rested on the will of the people as expressed in their local legislatures. They demanded their ""rights as Englishmen"" and ""no taxation without representation"". The British insisted on administering the empire through Parliament, and the conflict escalated into war.[76] The Second Continental Congress unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776; this day is celebrated annually as Independence Day.[77] In 1777, the Articles of Confederation established a decentralized government that operated until 1789.[77] After its defeat at the Siege of Yorktown in 1781, Britain signed a peace treaty. American sovereignty became internationally recognized, and the country was granted all lands east of the Mississippi River. Tensions with Britain remained, however, leading to the War of 1812, which was fought to a draw.[78] Nationalists led the Philadelphia Convention of 1787 in writing the United States Constitution, ratified in state conventions in 1788. The federal government was reorganized into three branches in 1789, on the principle of creating salutary checks and balances. George Washington, who had led the Continental Army to victory, was the first president elected under the new constitution. The Bill of Rights, forbidding federal restriction of personal freedoms and guaranteeing a range of legal protections, was adopted in 1791.[79] Territorial acquisitions of the United States between 1783 and 1917 Although the federal government outlawed American participation in the Atlantic slave trade in 1807, after 1820, cultivation of the highly profitable cotton crop exploded in the Deep South, and along with it, the slave population.[80][81][82] The Second Great Awakening, especially in the period 1800–1840, converted millions to evangelical Protestantism. In the North, it energized multiple social reform movements, including abolitionism;[83] in the South, Methodists and Baptists proselytized among slave populations.[84] Beginning in the late 18th century, American settlers began to expand westward,[85] prompting a long series of American Indian Wars.[86] The 1803 Louisiana Purchase almost doubled the nation's area,[87] Spain ceded Florida and other Gulf Coast territory in 1819,[88] the Republic of Texas was annexed in 1845 during a period of expansionism,[89] and the 1846 Oregon Treaty with Britain led to U.S. control of the present-day American Northwest.[90] Victory in the Mexican–American War resulted in the 1848 Mexican Cession of California and much of the present-day American Southwest, making the U.S. span the continent.[85][91] The California Gold Rush of 1848–1849 spurred migration to the Pacific coast, which led to the California Genocide[92] and the creation of additional western states.[93] The giving away of vast quantities of land to white European settlers as part of the Homestead Acts, nearly 10% of the total area of the United States, and to private railroad companies and colleges as part of land grants spurred economic development.[94] After the Civil War, new transcontinental railways made relocation easier for settlers, expanded internal trade, and increased conflicts with Native Americans.[95] In 1869, a new Peace Policy nominally promised to protect Native Americans from abuses, avoid further war, and secure their eventual U.S. citizenship. Nonetheless, large-scale conflicts continued throughout the West into the 1900s. Civil War and Reconstruction era Main articles: American Civil War and Reconstruction era The Battle of Gettysburg, fought between Union and Confederate forces on July 1–3, 1863, around the town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, marked a turning point in the American Civil War. Irreconcilable sectional conflict regarding the enslavement of Africans and African Americans ultimately led to the American Civil War.[96] With the 1860 election of Republican Abraham Lincoln, conventions in thirteen slave states declared secession and formed the Confederate States of America (the ""South"" or the ""Confederacy""), while the federal government (the ""Union"") maintained that secession was illegal.[97] In order to bring about this secession, military action was initiated by the secessionists, and the Union responded in kind. The ensuing war would become the deadliest military conflict in American history, resulting in the deaths of approximately 618,000 soldiers as well as many civilians.[98] The Union initially simply fought to keep the country united. Nevertheless, as casualties mounted after 1863 and Lincoln delivered his Emancipation Proclamation, the main purpose of the war from the Union's viewpoint became the abolition of slavery. Indeed, when the Union ultimately won the war in April 1865, each of the states in the defeated South was required to ratify the Thirteenth Amendment, which prohibited slavery except as penal labor. Two other amendments were also ratified, ensuring citizenship for blacks and, at least in theory, voting rights for them as well. Reconstruction began in earnest following the war. While President Lincoln attempted to foster friendship and forgiveness between the Union and the former Confederacy, his assassination on April 14, 1865 drove a wedge between North and South again. Republicans in the federal government made it their goal to oversee the rebuilding of the South and to ensure the rights of African Americans. They persisted until the Compromise of 1877 when the Republicans agreed to cease protecting the rights of African Americans in the South in order for Democrats to concede the presidential election of 1876. Southern white Democrats, calling themselves ""Redeemers"", took control of the South after the end of Reconstruction, beginning the nadir of American race relations. From 1890 to 1910, the Redeemers established so-called Jim Crow laws, disenfranchising most blacks and some poor whites throughout the region. Blacks would face racial segregation nationwide, especially in the South.[99] They also occasionally experienced vigilante violence, including lynching.[100] Further immigration, expansion, and industrialization Main articles: Economic history of the United States and Technological and industrial history of the United States Play media Film by Edison Studios showing immigrants disembarking at Ellis Island in New York Harbor, which served as a major entry point for European immigration into the U.S.[101] In the North, urbanization and an unprecedented influx of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe supplied a surplus of labor for the country's industrialization and transformed its culture.[102] National infrastructure, including telegraph and transcontinental railroads, spurred economic growth and greater settlement and development of the American Old West. The later invention of electric light and the telephone would also affect communication and urban life.[103] The United States fought Indian Wars west of the Mississippi River from 1810 to at least 1890.[104] Most of these conflicts ended with the cession of Native American territory and their confinement to Indian reservations. Additionally, the Trail of Tears in the 1830s exemplified the Indian removal policy that forcibly resettled Indians. This further expanded acreage under mechanical cultivation, increasing surpluses for international markets.[105] Mainland expansion also included the purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867.[106] In 1893, pro-American elements in Hawaii overthrew the Hawaiian monarchy and formed the Republic of Hawaii, which the U.S. annexed in 1898. Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines were ceded by Spain in the same year, following the Spanish–American War.[107] American Samoa was acquired by the United States in 1900 after the end of the Second Samoan Civil War.[108] The U.S. Virgin Islands were purchased from Denmark in 1917.[109] Rapid economic development during the late 19th and early 20th centuries fostered the rise of many prominent industrialists. Tycoons like Cornelius Vanderbilt, John D. Rockefeller, and Andrew Carnegie led the nation's progress in the railroad, petroleum, and steel industries. Banking became a major part of the economy, with J. P. Morgan playing a notable role. The American economy boomed, becoming the world's largest.[110] These dramatic changes were accompanied by social unrest and the rise of populist, socialist, and anarchist movements.[111] This period eventually ended with the advent of the Progressive Era, which saw significant reforms including women's suffrage, alcohol prohibition, regulation of consumer goods, and greater antitrust measures to ensure competition and attention to worker conditions.[112][113][114] World War I, Great Depression, and World War II Further information: World War I, Great Depression, and World War II The Empire State Building was the tallest building in the world when completed in 1931, during the Great Depression. The United States remained neutral from the outbreak of World War I in 1914 until 1917 when it joined the war as an ""associated power"" alongside the Allies of World War I, helping to turn the tide against the Central Powers. In 1919, President Woodrow Wilson took a leading diplomatic role at the Paris Peace Conference and advocated strongly for the U.S. to join the League of Nations. However, the Senate refused to approve this and did not ratify the Treaty of Versailles that established the League of Nations.[115] In 1920, the women's rights movement won passage of a constitutional amendment granting women's suffrage.[116] The 1920s and 1930s saw the rise of radio for mass communication and the invention of early television.[117] The prosperity of the Roaring Twenties ended with the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the onset of the Great Depression. After his election as president in 1932, Franklin D. Roosevelt responded with the New Deal.[118] The Great Migration of millions of African Americans out of the American South began before World War I and extended through the 1960s;[119] whereas the Dust Bowl of the mid-1930s impoverished many farming communities and spurred a new wave of western migration.[120] U.S. Marines raising the American flag on Mount Suribachi during the Battle of Iwo Jima in one of the most iconic images of the war. At first effectively neutral during World War II, the United States began supplying materiel to the Allies in March 1941 through the Lend-Lease program. On December 7, 1941, the Empire of Japan launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, prompting the United States to join the Allies against the Axis powers, and in the following year, to intern about 120,000[121] U.S. residents (including American citizens) of Japanese descent.[122] Although Japan attacked the United States first, the U.S. nonetheless pursued a ""Europe first"" defense policy.[123] The United States thus left its vast Asian colony, the Philippines, isolated and fighting a losing struggle against Japanese invasion and occupation. During the war, the United States was one of the ""Four Powers""[124] who met to plan the postwar world, along with Britain, the Soviet Union, and China.[125][126] Although the nation lost around 400,000 military personnel,[127] it emerged relatively undamaged from the war with even greater economic and military influence.[128] The United States played a leading role in the Bretton Woods and Yalta conferences, which signed agreements on new international financial institutions and Europe's postwar reorganization. As an Allied victory was won in Europe, a 1945 international conference held in San Francisco produced the United Nations Charter, which became active after the war.[129] The United States and Japan then fought each other in the largest naval battle in history, the Battle of Leyte Gulf.[130][131] The United States developed the first nuclear weapons and used them on Japan in the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945; the Japanese surrendered on September 2, ending World War II.[132][133] Cold War and civil rights era Main articles: History of the United States (1945–1964), History of the United States (1964–1980), and History of the United States (1980–1991) Further information: Cold War, Civil Rights Movement, War on Poverty, Space Race, and Reaganomics Martin Luther King Jr. gives his famous ""I Have a Dream"" speech at the Lincoln Memorial during the March on Washington, 1963 U.S. president Ronald Reagan (left) and Soviet general secretary Mikhail Gorbachev at the Geneva Summit in 1985 After World War II, the United States and the Soviet Union competed for power, influence, and prestige during what became known as the Cold War, driven by an ideological divide between capitalism and communism.[134] They dominated the military affairs of Europe, with the U.S. and its NATO allies on one side and the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies on the other. The U.S. developed a policy of containment towards the expansion of communist influence. While the U.S. and Soviet Union engaged in proxy wars and developed powerful nuclear arsenals, the two countries avoided direct military conflict.[135] The United States often opposed Third World movements that it viewed as Soviet-sponsored and occasionally pursued direct action for regime change against left-wing governments, occasionally supporting authoritarian right-wing regimes.[136] American troops fought communist Chinese and North Korean forces in the Korean War of 1950–1953.[137] The Soviet Union's 1957 launch of the first artificial satellite and its 1961 launch of the first crewed spaceflight initiated a ""Space Race"" in which the United States became the first nation to land a man on the Moon in 1969.[137] The United States became increasingly involved in the Vietnam War (1955–1975), introducing combat forces in 1965.[138] At home, the U.S. had experienced sustained economic expansion and a rapid growth of its population and middle class following World War II. After a surge in female labor participation, especially in the 1970s, by 1985, the majority of women aged 16 and over were employed.[139] Construction of an Interstate Highway System transformed the nation's infrastructure over the following decades. Millions moved from farms and inner cities to large suburban housing developments.[140][141] In 1959, the United States formally expanded beyond the contiguous United States when the territories of Alaska and Hawaii became, respectively, the 49th and 50th states admitted into the Union.[142] The growing Civil Rights Movement used nonviolence to confront segregation and discrimination, with Martin Luther King Jr. becoming a prominent leader and figurehead.[143] A combination of court decisions and legislation, culminating in the Civil Rights Act of 1968, sought to end racial discrimination.[144][145][146] Meanwhile, a counterculture movement grew, which was fueled by opposition to the Vietnam war, the Black Power movement, and the sexual revolution.[147] The launch of a ""War on Poverty"" expanded entitlements and welfare spending, including the creation of Medicare and Medicaid, two programs that provide health coverage to the elderly and poor, respectively, and the means-tested Food Stamp Program and Aid to Families with Dependent Children.[148] The 1970s and early 1980s saw the onset of stagflation. The United States supported Israel during the Yom Kippur War; in response, the country faced an oil embargo from OPEC nations, sparking the 1973 oil crisis. In 1979, President Jimmy Carter brokered a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel, marking the first time an Arab nation recognized Israeli existence.[relevant?] After his election, President Ronald Reagan responded to economic stagnation with free-market oriented reforms. Following the collapse of détente, he abandoned ""containment"" and initiated the more aggressive ""rollback"" strategy towards the Soviet Union.[149][150] The late 1980s brought a ""thaw"" in relations with the Soviet Union, and its collapse in 1991 finally ended the Cold War.[151][152][153] This brought about unipolarity[154] with the U.S. unchallenged as the world's dominant superpower.[155] Contemporary history Main articles: History of the United States (1991–2008) and History of the United States (2008–present) The World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan during the September 11 terrorist attacks by the Islamic terrorist group Al-Qaeda in 2001 After the Cold War, the conflict in the Middle East triggered a crisis in 1990, when Iraq invaded and annexed Kuwait, an ally of the United States. Fearing the spread of instability, in August, President George H. W. Bush launched and led the Gulf War against Iraq; waged until January 1991 by coalition forces from 34 nations, it ended in the expulsion of Iraqi forces from Kuwait and restoration of the monarchy.[156] Originating within U.S. military defense networks, the Internet spread to international academic platforms and then to the public in the 1990s, greatly affecting the global economy, society, and culture.[157] Due to the dot-com boom, stable monetary policy, and reduced social welfare spending, the 1990s saw the longest economic expansion in modern U.S. history.[158] Beginning in 1994, the U.S. signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), causing trade among the U.S., Canada, and Mexico to soar.[159] On September 11, 2001, Al-Qaeda terrorist hijackers flew passenger planes into the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon near Washington, D.C., killing nearly 3,000 people.[160] In response, President George W. Bush launched the War on Terror, which included a nearly 20-year war in Afghanistan from 2001 to 2021 and the 2003–2011 Iraq War.[161][162] A 2011 military operation in Pakistan led to the death of the leader of Al-Qaeda.[163] Government policy designed to promote affordable housing,[164] widespread failures in corporate and regulatory governance,[165] and historically low interest rates set by the Federal Reserve[166] led to the mid-2000s housing bubble, which culminated with the 2008 financial crisis, the nation's largest economic contraction since the Great Depression.[167] During the crisis, assets owned by Americans lost about a quarter of their value.[168] Barack Obama, the first multiracial[169] president, with African-American ancestry[170] was elected in 2008 amid the crisis,[171] and subsequently passed stimulus measures and the Dodd–Frank Act in an attempt to mitigate its negative effects and ensure there would not be a repeat of the crisis. In 2010, President Obama led efforts to pass the Affordable Care Act, the most sweeping reform to the nation's healthcare system in nearly five decades.[172] In the presidential election of 2016, Republican Donald Trump was elected as the 45th president of the United States, a result viewed as one of the biggest political upsets since the 1948 election.[173] In the presidential election of 2020, Democrat Joe Biden was elected as the 46th president.[174] On January 6, 2021, supporters of outgoing President Trump stormed the United States Capitol in an unsuccessful effort to disrupt the presidential Electoral College vote count.[175] Geography Main article: Geography of the United States Köppen climate classifications of U.S. states and territories The 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia occupy a combined area of 3,119,885 square miles (8,080,470 km2). Of this area, 2,959,064 square miles (7,663,940 km2) is contiguous land, composing 83.65% of total U.S. land area.[176][177] Hawaii, occupying an archipelago in the central Pacific, southwest of North America, is 10,931 square miles (28,311 km2) in area. The five populated but unincorporated territories of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and U.S. Virgin Islands together cover 9,185 square miles (23,789 km2).[178] Measured by only land area, the United States is third in size behind Russia and China, just ahead of Canada.[179] The United States is the world's third- or fourth-largest nation by total area (land and water), ranking behind Russia and Canada and nearly equal to China. The ranking varies depending on how two territories disputed by China and India are counted, and how the total size of the United States is measured.[d][180][181] The coastal plain of the Atlantic seaboard gives way further inland to deciduous forests and the rolling hills of the Piedmont.[182] The Appalachian Mountains divide the eastern seaboard from the Great Lakes and the grasslands of the Midwest.[183] The Mississippi–Missouri River, the world's fourth longest river system, runs mainly north–south through the heart of the country. The flat, fertile prairie of the Great Plains stretches to the west, interrupted by a highland region in the southeast.[183] The Rocky Mountains, west of the Great Plains, extend north to south across the country, peaking around 14,000 feet (4,300 m) in Colorado.[184] Farther west are the rocky Great Basin and deserts such as the Chihuahua and Mojave.[185] The Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges run close to the Pacific coast, both ranges reaching altitudes higher than 14,000 feet (4,300 m). The lowest and highest points in the contiguous United States are in the state of California,[186] and only about 84 miles (135 km) apart.[187] At an elevation of 20,310 feet (6,190.5 m), Alaska's Denali is the highest peak in the country and in North America.[188] Active volcanoes are common throughout Alaska's Alexander and Aleutian Islands, and Hawaii consists of volcanic islands. The supervolcano underlying Yellowstone National Park in the Rockies is the continent's largest volcanic feature.[189] The United States, with its large size and geographic variety, includes most climate types. To the east of the 100th meridian, the climate ranges from humid continental in the north to humid subtropical in the south.[190] The Great Plains west of the 100th meridian are semi-arid. Much of the Western mountains have an alpine climate. The climate is arid in the Great Basin, desert in the Southwest, Mediterranean in coastal California, and oceanic in coastal Oregon and Washington and southern Alaska. Most of Alaska is subarctic or polar. Hawaii and the southern tip of Florida are tropical, as well as its territories in the Caribbean and the Pacific.[191] States bordering the Gulf of Mexico are prone to hurricanes, and most of the world's tornadoes occur in the country, mainly in Tornado Alley areas in the Midwest and South.[192] Overall, the United States receives more high-impact extreme weather incidents than any other country in the world.[193] Wildlife and conservation Main articles: Fauna of the United States and Flora of the United States The bald eagle has been the national bird of the United States since 1782.[194] The U.S. is one of 17 megadiverse countries containing a large amount of endemic species: about 17,000 species of vascular plants occur in the contiguous United States and Alaska, and more than 1,800 species of flowering plants are found in Hawaii, few of which occur on the mainland.[195] The United States is home to 428 mammal species, 784 bird species, 311 reptile species, and 295 amphibian species,[196] as well as about 91,000 insect species.[197] There are 62 national parks and hundreds of other federally managed parks, forests, and wilderness areas.[198] Altogether, the government owns about 28% of the country's land area,[199] mostly in the western states.[200] Most of this land is protected, though some is leased for oil and gas drilling, mining, logging, or cattle ranching, and about .86% is used for military purposes.[201][202] Environmental issues include debates on oil and nuclear energy, dealing with air and water pollution, the economic costs of protecting wildlife, logging and deforestation,[203][204] and climate change.[205][206] The most prominent environmental agency is the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), created by presidential order in 1970.[207] The idea of wilderness has shaped the management of public lands since 1964, with the Wilderness Act.[208] The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is intended to protect threatened and endangered species and their habitats, which are monitored by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.[209] The United States is ranked 24th among nations in the Environmental Performance Index.[210] The country joined the Paris Agreement on climate change in 2016 and has many other environmental commitments.[211] It left the Paris Agreement in 2020,[212] and rejoined it in 2021.[213] Demographics Main articles: Americans, Demographics of the United States, Race and ethnicity in the United States, and Family structure in the United States Population See also: List of U.S. states by population and List of United States cities by population Historical population Census Pop. %± 17903,929,214—18005,308,48335.1%18107,239,88136.4%18209,638,45333.1%183012,866,02033.5%184017,069,45332.7%185023,191,87635.9%186031,443,32135.6%187038,558,37122.6%188050,189,20930.2%189062,979,76625.5%190076,212,16821.0%191092,228,49621.0%1920106,021,53715.0%1930123,202,62416.2%1940132,164,5697.3%1950151,325,79814.5%1960179,323,17518.5%1970203,211,92613.3%1980226,545,80511.5%1990248,709,8739.8%2000281,421,90613.2%2010308,745,5389.7%2020331,449,2817.4%Note that the census numbers donot include Native Americans until 1860.[214] The U.S. Census Bureau reported 331,449,281 residents as of April 1, 2020.[215] This figure, like most official data for the United States as a whole, excludes the five unincorporated territories (Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands) and minor island possessions. According to the Bureau's U.S. Population Clock, on January 28, 2021, the U.S. population had a net gain of one person every 100 seconds, or about 864 people per day.[216] The United States is the third most populous nation in the world, after China and India. In 2020 the median age of the United States population was 38.5 years.[217] In 2018, there were almost 90 million immigrants and U.S.-born children of immigrants in the United States, accounting for 28% of the overall U.S. population.[218] The United States has a diverse population; 37 ancestry groups have more than one million members.[219] White Americans of European ancestry, mostly German, Irish, English, Italian, Polish and French,[220] including White Hispanic and Latino Americans from Latin America, form the largest racial group, at 73.1% of the population. African Americans constitute the nation's largest racial minority and third-largest ancestry group, and are around 13% of the total U.S. population.[219] Asian Americans are the country's second-largest racial minority (the three largest Asian ethnic groups are Chinese, Filipino, and Indian).[219] In 2017, out of the U.S. foreign-born population, some 45% (20.7 million) were naturalized citizens, 27% (12.3 million) were lawful permanent residents, 6% (2.2 million) were temporary lawful residents, and 23% (10.5 million) were unauthorized immigrants.[221] Among current living immigrants to the U.S., the top five countries of birth are Mexico, China, India, the Philippines and El Salvador. Until 2017, the United States led the world in refugee resettlement for decades, admitting more refugees than the rest of the world combined.[222] About 82% of Americans live in urban areas, including suburbs;[181] about half of those reside in cities with populations over 50,000.[223] In 2008, 273 incorporated municipalities had populations over 100,000, nine cities had more than one million residents, and four cities had over two million (namely New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston).[224] Many U.S. metropolitan populations are growing rapidly, particularly in the South and West.[225] As of 2018[update], 52% of Americans age 15 and over were married, 6% were widowed, 10% were divorced, and 32% had never been married.[226] As of 2020, the total fertility rate stood at 1.64 children per woman.[227] In 2013, the average age at first birth was 26, and 41% of births were to unmarried women.[228] In 2019, the U.S. had the world's highest rate (23%) of children living in single-parent households; the rates in Canada and Mexico were 15% and 7%, respectively.[229] Language Main article: Languages of the United States English (specifically, American English) is the de facto national language of the United States. Although there is no official language at the federal level, some laws—such as U.S. naturalization requirements—standardize English, and most states have declared English as the official language.[230] Three states and four U.S. territories have recognized local or indigenous languages in addition to English, including Hawaii (Hawaiian),[231] Alaska (twenty Native languages),[k][232] South Dakota (Sioux),[233] American Samoa (Samoan), Puerto Rico (Spanish), Guam (Chamorro), and the Northern Mariana Islands (Carolinian and Chamorro). In Puerto Rico, Spanish is more widely spoken than English.[234] According to the American Community Survey, in 2010 some 229 million people (out of the total U.S. population of 308 million) spoke only English at home. More than 37 million spoke Spanish at home, making it the second most commonly used language in the United States. Other languages spoken at home by one million people or more include Chinese (2.8 million), Tagalog (1.6 million), Vietnamese (1.4 million), French (1.3 million), Korean (1.1 million), and German (1 million).[235] The most widely taught foreign languages in the United States, in terms of enrollment numbers from kindergarten through university undergraduate education, are Spanish (around 7.2 million students), French (1.5 million), and German (500,000). Other commonly taught languages include Latin, Japanese, American Sign Language, Italian, and Chinese.[236][237] 18% of all Americans claim to speak both English and another language.[238] Religion Main article: Religion in the United States Percentage of respondents in the United States saying that religion is ""very important"" or ""somewhat important"" in their lives (2014).[239] The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees the free exercise of religion and forbids Congress from passing laws respecting its establishment. The United States has the world's largest Christian population.[240] In a 2014 survey, 70.6% of adults in the United States identified themselves as Christians;[241] Protestants accounted for 46.5%, while Catholics, at 20.8%, formed the largest single Christian denomination.[242] In 2014, 5.9% of the U.S. adult population claimed a non-Christian religion.[243] These include Judaism (1.9%), Islam (0.9%), Hinduism (0.7%), and Buddhism (0.7%).[243] The survey also reported that 22.8% of Americans described themselves as agnostic, atheist or simply having no religion—up from 8.2% in 1990.[242][244][245] Membership in a house of worship fell from 70% in 1999 to 47% in 2020, much of the decline related to the number of Americans expressing no religious preference. However, membership also fell among those who identified with a specific religious group.[246][247] Protestantism is the largest Christian religious grouping in the United States, accounting for almost half of all Americans. Baptists collectively form the largest branch of Protestantism at 15.4%,[248] and the Southern Baptist Convention is the largest individual Protestant denomination at 5.3% of the U.S. population.[248] Apart from Baptists, other Protestant categories include nondenominational Protestants, Methodists, Pentecostals, unspecified Protestants, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, other Reformed, Episcopalians/Anglicans, Quakers, Adventists, Holiness, Christian fundamentalists, Anabaptists, Pietists, and multiple others.[248] The Bible Belt is an informal term for a region in the Southern United States in which socially conservative evangelical Protestantism is a significant part of the culture and Christian church attendance across the denominations is generally higher than the nation's average. By contrast, religion plays the least important role in New England and in the Western United States.[249] Health See also: Health care in the United States, Health care reform in the United States, and Health insurance in the United States The Texas Medical Center in downtown Houston is the largest medical complex in the world. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that the United States had an average life expectancy at birth of 78.8 years in 2019 (76.3 years for men and 81.4 years for women), up 0.1 year from 2018.[250] This was the second year that overall U.S. life expectancy rose slightly after three years of overall declines that followed decades of continuous improvement. The recent decline, primarily among the age group 25 to 64, was largely due to record highs in the drug overdose and suicide rates; the country still has one of the highest suicide rates among wealthy countries.[251][252][253] From 1999 to 2019, more than 770,000 Americans died from drug overdoses.[254] Life expectancy was highest among Asians and Hispanics and lowest among blacks.[255][256] Increasing obesity in the United States and improvements in health and longevity outside the U.S. contributed to lowering the country's rank in life expectancy from 11th in the world in 1987 to 42nd in 2007. In 2017, the United States had the lowest life expectancy among Japan, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, and seven nations in western Europe.[257][258] Obesity rates have more than doubled in the last 30 years and are the highest in the industrialized world.[259][260] Approximately one-third of the adult population is obese and an additional third is overweight.[261] Obesity-related type 2 diabetes is considered epidemic by health care professionals.[262] In 2010, coronary artery disease, lung cancer, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and traffic accidents caused the most years of life lost in the U.S. Low back pain, depression, musculoskeletal disorders, neck pain, and anxiety caused the most years lost to disability. The most harmful risk factors were poor diet, tobacco smoking, obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, physical inactivity, and alcohol use. Alzheimer's disease, substance use disorders, kidney disease, cancer, and falls caused the most additional years of life lost over their age-adjusted 1990 per-capita rates.[263] U.S. teenage pregnancy and abortion rates are substantially higher than in other Western nations, especially among blacks and Hispanics.[264] Government-funded health care coverage for the poor (Medicaid, established in 1965) and for those age 65 and older (Medicare, begun in 1966) is available to Americans who meet the programs' income or age qualifications. Nonetheless, the United States remains the only developed nation without a system of universal health care.[265] In 2017, 12.2% of the population did not carry health insurance.[266] The subject of uninsured and underinsured Americans is a major political issue.[267][268] The Affordable Care Act (ACA), passed in early 2010 and informally known as ""ObamaCare"", roughly halved the uninsured share of the population. The bill and its ultimate effect are still issues of controversy in the United States.[269][270] The U.S. health care system far outspends that of any other nation, measured both in per capita spending and as a percentage of GDP.[271] However, the U.S. is a global leader in medical innovation.[272] Education Main articles: Education in the United States and Higher education in the United States Columbia University, founded in 1754, is one of the colonial colleges and the fifth-oldest institution of higher learning in the United States. American public education is operated by state and local governments and regulated by the United States Department of Education through restrictions on federal grants. In most states, children are required to attend school from the age of five or six (beginning with kindergarten or first grade) until they turn 18 (generally bringing them through twelfth grade, the end of high school); some states allow students to leave school at 16 or 17.[273] About 12% of children are enrolled in parochial or nonsectarian private schools. 3.4% of children are homeschooled as of 2012.[274] The U.S. spends more on education per student than any nation in the world,[275] spending an average of $12,794 per year on public elementary and secondary school students in the 2016–2017 school year.[276] Some 80% of U.S. college students attend public universities.[277] Of Americans 25 and older, 84.6% graduated from high school, 52.6% attended some college, 27.2% earned a bachelor's degree, and 9.6% earned graduate degrees.[278] The basic literacy rate is approximately 99%.[181][279] The United Nations assigns the United States an Education Index of 0.97, tying it for 12th in the world.[280] The United States has many private and public institutions of higher education. The majority of the world's top universities, as listed by various ranking organizations, are in the U.S.[281][282][283] There are also local community colleges with generally more open admission policies, shorter academic programs, and lower tuition. In 2018, U21, a network of research-intensive universities, ranked the United States first in the world for breadth and quality of higher education, and 15th when GDP was a factor.[284] As for public expenditures on higher education, the U.S. trails some other OECD (Organization for Cooperation and Development) nations but spends more per student than the OECD average, and more than all nations in combined public and private spending.[285][286] As of 2018[update], student loan debt exceeded 1.5 trillion dollars.[287][288] Government and politics Main articles: Federal government of the United States, Politics of the United States, State governments of the United States, and Local government in the United States The United States Capitol,where Congress meets:the Senate, left; the House, rightThe White House, residence and workplace of the U.S. PresidentThe Supreme Court Building, where the nation's highest court sits The United States is a federal republic of 50 states, a federal district, five territories and several uninhabited island possessions.[289][290][291] It is the world's oldest surviving federation. It is a federal republic and a representative democracy ""in which majority rule is tempered by minority rights protected by law.""[292] Since 2015, the U.S. has ranked 25th on the Democracy Index, and is described as a ""flawed democracy"".[293] On Transparency International's 2019 Corruption Perceptions Index, its public sector position deteriorated from a score of 76 in 2015 to 69 in 2019.[294] In the American federalist system, citizens are usually subject to three levels of government: federal, state, and local. The local government's duties are commonly split between county and municipal governments. In almost all cases, executive and legislative officials are elected by a plurality vote of citizens by district. The government is regulated by a system of checks and balances defined by the U.S. Constitution, which serves as the country's supreme legal document.[295] The original text of the Constitution establishes the structure and responsibilities of the federal government and its relationship with the individual states. Article One protects the right to the writ of habeas corpus. The Constitution has been amended 27 times;[296] the first ten amendments, which make up the Bill of Rights, and the Fourteenth Amendment form the central basis of Americans' individual rights. All laws and governmental procedures are subject to judicial review, and any law can be voided if the courts determine that it violates the Constitution. The principle of judicial review, not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, was established by the Supreme Court in Marbury v. Madison (1803)[297] in a decision handed down by Chief Justice John Marshall.[298] The federal government comprises three branches: Legislative: The bicameral Congress, made up of the Senate and the House of Representatives, makes federal law, declares war, approves treaties, has the power of the purse,[299] and has the power of impeachment, by which it can remove sitting members of the government.[300] Executive: The president is the commander-in-chief of the military, can veto legislative bills before they become law (subject to congressional override), and appoints the members of the Cabinet (subject to Senate approval) and other officers, who administer and enforce federal laws and policies.[301] Judicial: The Supreme Court and lower federal courts, whose judges are appointed by the president with Senate approval, interpret laws and overturn those they find unconstitutional.[302] The House of Representatives has 435 voting members, each representing a congressional district for a two-year term. House seats are apportioned among the states by population. Each state then draws single-member districts to conform with the census apportionment. The District of Columbia and the five major U.S. territories each have one member of Congress—these members are not allowed to vote.[303] The Senate has 100 members with each state having two senators, elected at-large to six-year terms; one-third of Senate seats are up for election every two years. The District of Columbia and the five major U.S. territories do not have senators.[303] The president serves a four-year term and may be elected to the office no more than twice. The president is not elected by direct vote, but by an indirect electoral college system in which the determining votes are apportioned to the states and the District of Columbia.[304] The Supreme Court, led by the chief justice of the United States, has nine members, who serve for life.[305] Political divisions Main articles: Political divisions of the United States, U.S. state, Territories of the United States, List of states and territories of the United States, and Indian reservation Further information: Territorial evolution of the United States Map of the United States showing the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the 5 major U.S. territories The 50 states are the principal political divisions in the country. Each state holds jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, where it shares sovereignty with the federal government. They are subdivided into counties or county equivalents and further divided into municipalities. The District of Columbia is a federal district that contains the capital of the United States, the city of Washington.[306] The states and the District of Columbia choose the president of the United States. Each state has presidential electors equal to the number of their representatives and senators in Congress; the District of Columbia has three because of the 23rd Amendment.[307] Territories of the United States such as Puerto Rico do not have presidential electors, and so people in those territories cannot vote for the president.[303] The United States also observes tribal sovereignty of the American Indian nations to a limited degree, as it does with the states' sovereignty. American Indians are U.S. citizens and tribal lands are subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Congress and the federal courts. Like the states they have a great deal of autonomy, but also like the states, tribes are not allowed to make war, engage in their own foreign relations, or print and issue currency.[308] Citizenship is granted at birth in all states, the District of Columbia, and all major U.S. territories except American Samoa.[l][312][309] State and district flags and statehood dates(listed alphabetically) Alabama: Dec. 14, 1819 Alaska: Jan. 3, 1959 Arizona: Feb. 14, 1912 Arkansas: Jun. 15, 1836 California: Sep. 9, 1850 Colorado: Aug. 1, 1876 Connecticut: Jan. 9, 1788 Delaware: Dec. 7, 1787 District of Columbia*: Jul. 16, 1790 Florida: Mar. 3, 1845 Georgia: Jan. 2, 1788 Hawaii: Aug. 21, 1959 Idaho: Jul. 3, 1890 Illinois: Dec. 3, 1818 Indiana: Dec. 11, 1816 Iowa: Dec. 28, 1846 Kansas: Jan. 29, 1861 Kentucky: Jun. 1, 1792 Louisiana: Apr. 30, 1812 Maine: Mar. 15, 1820 Maryland: Apr. 28, 1788 Massachusetts: Feb. 6, 1788 Michigan: Jan. 26, 1837 Minnesota: May 11, 1858 Mississippi: Dec. 10, 1817 Missouri: Aug. 10, 1821 Montana: Nov. 8, 1889 Nebraska: Mar. 1, 1867 Nevada: Oct. 31, 1864 New Hampshire: Jun. 21, 1788 New Jersey: Dec. 18, 1787 New Mexico: Jan. 6, 1912 New York: Jul. 26, 1788 North Carolina: Nov. 21, 1789 North Dakota: Nov. 2, 1889 Ohio: Mar. 1, 1803 Oklahoma: Nov. 16, 1907 Oregon: Feb. 14, 1859 Pennsylvania: Dec. 12, 1787 Rhode Island: May 29, 1790 South Carolina: May 23, 1788 South Dakota: Nov. 2, 1889 Tennessee: Jun. 1, 1796 Texas: Dec. 29, 1845 Utah: Jan. 4, 1896 Vermont: Mar. 4, 1791 Virginia: Jun. 25, 1788 Washington: Nov. 11, 1889 West Virginia: Jun. 20, 1863 Wisconsin: May 29, 1848 Wyoming: Jul. 10, 1890 (listed chronologically) Dec. 7, 1787:  Delaware Dec. 12, 1787:  Pennsylvania Dec. 18, 1787:  New Jersey Jan. 2, 1788:  Georgia Jan. 9, 1788:  Connecticut Feb. 6, 1788:  Massachusetts Apr. 28, 1788:  Maryland May 23, 1788:  South Carolina Jun. 21, 1788:  New Hampshire Jun. 25, 1788:  Virginia Jul. 26, 1788:  New York Nov. 21, 1789:  North Carolina May 29, 1790:  Rhode Island Mar. 4, 1791:  Vermont Jun. 1, 1792:  Kentucky Jun. 1, 1796:  Tennessee Jul. 16, 1790:  District of Columbia* Mar. 1, 1803:  Ohio Apr. 30, 1812:  Louisiana Dec. 11, 1816:  Indiana Dec. 10, 1817:  Mississippi Dec. 3, 1818:  Illinois Dec. 14, 1819:  Alabama Mar. 15, 1820:  Maine Aug. 10, 1821:  Missouri Jun. 15, 1836:  Arkansas Jan. 26, 1837:  Michigan Mar. 3, 1845:  Florida Dec. 29, 1845:  Texas Dec. 28, 1846:  Iowa May 29, 1848:  Wisconsin Sep. 9, 1850:  California May 11, 1858:  Minnesota Feb. 14, 1859:  Oregon Jan. 29, 1861:  Kansas Jun. 20, 1863:  West Virginia Oct. 31, 1864:  Nevada Mar. 1, 1867:  Nebraska Aug. 1, 1876:  Colorado Nov. 2, 1889:  North Dakota Nov. 2, 1889:  South Dakota Nov. 8, 1889:  Montana Nov. 11, 1889:  Washington Jul. 3, 1890:  Idaho Jul. 10, 1890:  Wyoming Jan. 4, 1896:  Utah Nov. 16, 1907:  Oklahoma Jan. 6, 1912 :  New Mexico Feb. 14, 1912 :  Arizona Jan. 3, 1959:  Alaska Aug. 21, 1959:  Hawaii Statehood date is the date of ratifying the Constitution (for the first 13) or being admitted to the Union (for subsequent states) *District of Columbia is a district not a state Territory flags and dates(listed alphabetically) American Samoa: Apr. 17, 1900 Guam: Apr. 11, 1899 Northern Mariana Islands: Nov. 4, 1986 Puerto Rico: Apr. 11, 1899 US Virgin Islands: Mar. 31, 1917 (listed chronologically) Apr. 11, 1899:  Guam Apr. 11, 1899:  Puerto Rico Apr. 17, 1900:  American Samoa Mar. 31, 1917:  US Virgin Islands Nov. 4, 1986:  Northern Mariana Islands Territory date is the date the territory was acquired by the United States.

Parties and elections Main articles: Political parties in the United States, Elections in the United States, and Political ideologies in the United States Joe Biden46th PresidentKamala Harris49th Vice Presidentsince January 20, 2021 The United States has operated under a two-party system for most of its history.[313] For elective offices at most levels, state-administered primary elections choose the major party nominees for subsequent general elections. Since the general election of 1856, the major parties have been the Democratic Party, founded in 1824, and the Republican Party, founded in 1854. Since the Civil War, only one third-party presidential candidate—former president Theodore Roosevelt, running as a Progressive in 1912—has won as much as 20% of the popular vote. The president and vice president are elected by the Electoral College.[314] In American political culture, the center-right Republican Party is considered ""conservative"" and the center-left Democratic Party is considered ""liberal"".[315][316] The states of the Northeast and West Coast and some of the Great Lakes states, known as ""blue states"", are relatively liberal. The ""red states"" of the South and parts of the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains are relatively conservative. Democrat Joe Biden, the winner of the 2020 presidential election and former vice president, is serving as the 46th president of the United States. Leadership in the Senate includes Vice President Kamala Harris, President pro tempore Patrick Leahy, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.[317] Leadership in the House includes Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, and Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.[318] In the 117th United States Congress, the House of Representatives and the Senate are narrowly controlled by the Democratic Party. The Senate consists of 50 Republicans and 48 Democrats with two Independents who caucus with the Democrats; the House consists of 222 Democrats and 211 Republicans.[319] Of state governors, there are 27 Republicans and 23 Democrats. Among the D.C. mayor and the five territorial governors, there are three Democrats, one Republican, and one New Progressive.[320] Foreign relations Main articles: Foreign relations of the United States and Foreign policy of the United States Diplomatic relations of the United States  United States  Countries that have diplomatic relations with the United States  Countries that do not have diplomatic relations with the United States  Disputed territories  Antarctica The United States has an established structure of foreign relations. It is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. New York City is home to the United Nations Headquarters. Almost all countries have embassies in Washington, D.C., and many have consulates around the country. Likewise, nearly all nations host American diplomatic missions. However, Iran, North Korea, Bhutan, and the Republic of China (Taiwan) do not have formal diplomatic relations with the United States (although the U.S. still maintains unofficial relations with Bhutan and Taiwan).[321] It is a member of the G7,[322] G20, and OECD. The United States has a ""Special Relationship"" with the United Kingdom[323] and strong ties with Canada,[324] India, Australia,[325] New Zealand,[326] the Philippines,[327] Japan,[328] South Korea,[329] Israel,[330] and several European Union countries, including France, Italy, Germany, Spain and Poland.[331] It works closely with fellow NATO members on military and security issues and with its neighbors through the Organization of American States and free trade agreements such as the trilateral United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement. Colombia is traditionally considered by the United States as its most loyal ally in South America.[332][333] The U.S. exercises full international defense authority and responsibility for Micronesia, the Marshall Islands and Palau through the Compact of Free Association.[334] Government finance See also: Taxation in the United States and United States federal budget U.S. Government spending and revenue from 1792 to 2018 Taxation in the United States is progressive,[335][336] and is levied at the federal, state, and local government levels. This includes taxes on income, payroll, property, sales, imports, estates, and gifts, as well as various fees. Taxation in the United States is based on citizenship, not residency.[337] Both non-resident citizens and Green Card holders living abroad are taxed on their income irrespective of where they live or where their income is earned. The United States is one of the few countries in the world to do so.[338] In 2010 taxes collected by federal, state and municipal governments amounted to 24.8% of GDP.[339] Based on CBO estimates,[340] under 2013 tax law the top 1% will be paying the highest average tax rates since 1979, while other income groups will remain at historic lows.[341] For 2018, the effective tax rate for the wealthiest 400 households was 23%, compared to 24.2% for the bottom half of U.S. households.[342] During fiscal year 2012, the federal government spent $3.54 trillion on a budget or cash basis. Major categories of fiscal year 2012 spending included: Medicare & Medicaid (23%), Social Security (22%), Defense Department (19%), non-defense discretionary (17%), other mandatory (13%) and interest (6%).[343] In 2018, the United States had the largest external debt in the world.[344] As a percentage of GDP, it had the 34th largest government debt in the world in 2017; however, more recent estimates vary.[345] The total national debt of the United States was $23.201 trillion, or 107% of GDP, in the fourth quarter of 2019.[346] By 2012, total federal debt had surpassed 100% of U.S. GDP.[347] The U.S. has a credit rating of AA+ from Standard & Poor's, AAA from Fitch, and AAA from Moody's.[348] Military Main article: United States Armed Forces The nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS George Washington (CVN 73) The president is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces and appoints its leaders, the secretary of defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Department of Defense administers five of the six service branches, which are made up of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Space Force. The Coast Guard, also a branch of the armed forces, is normally administered by the Department of Homeland Security in peacetime and can be transferred to the Department of the Navy in wartime.[citation needed] In 2019, all six branches of the U.S. Armed Forces reported 1.4 million personnel on active duty.[349] The Reserves and National Guard brought the total number of troops to 2.3 million.[349] The Department of Defense also employed about 700,000 civilians, not including contractors.[350] Global presence of the United States military, showing Unified combatant commands Military service in the United States is voluntary, although conscription may occur in wartime through the Selective Service System.[351] From 1940 until 1973, conscription was mandatory even during peacetime.[352] Today, American forces can be rapidly deployed by the Air Force's large fleet of transport aircraft, the Navy's 11 active aircraft carriers, and Marine expeditionary units at sea with the Navy, and Army's XVIII Airborne Corps and 75th Ranger Regiment deployed by Air Force transport aircraft. The Air Force can strike targets across the globe through its fleet of strategic bombers, maintains the air defense across the United States, and provides close air support to Army and Marine Corps ground forces.[353][354][355] The Space Force operates the Global Positioning System, operates the Eastern and Western Ranges for all space launches, and operates the United States' Space Surveillance and Missile Warning networks.[356][357][358] The military operates about 800 bases and facilities abroad,[359] and maintains deployments greater than 100 active duty personnel in 25 foreign countries.[360] The United States spent $649 billion on its military in 2019, 36% of global military spending.[361] At 4.7% of GDP, the rate was the second-highest among the top 15 military spenders, after Saudi Arabia.[361] Defense spending plays a major role in science and technology investment, with roughly half of U.S. federal research and development funded by the Department of Defense.[362] Defense's share of the overall U.S. economy has generally declined in recent decades, from early Cold War peaks of 14.2% of GDP in 1953 and 69.5% of federal spending in 1954 to 4.7% of GDP and 18.8% of federal spending in 2011.[363] In total number of personnel, the United States has the third-largest combined armed forces in the world, behind the Chinese People's Liberation Army and Indian Armed Forces.[364] The country is one of the five recognized nuclear weapons states and one of nine countries to possess nuclear weapons.[365] The United States possesses the second-largest stockpile of nuclear weapons in the world, behind Russia.[365] More than 40% of the world's 14,000 nuclear weapons are held by the United States.[365] Law enforcement and crime Main articles: Law enforcement in the United States and Crime in the United States See also: Law of the United States, Human rights in the United States § Justice system, Incarceration in the United States, Police brutality in the United States, and Capital punishment in the United States The New York City Police Department is the nation's largest municipal law enforcement agency. Law enforcement in the United States is primarily the responsibility of local police departments and sheriff's offices, with state police providing broader services. Federal agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the U.S. Marshals Service have specialized duties, including protecting civil rights, national security and enforcing U.S. federal courts' rulings and federal laws.[366] State courts conduct most criminal trials while federal courts handle certain designated crimes as well as certain appeals from the state criminal courts. A cross-sectional analysis of the World Health Organization Mortality Database from 2010 showed that United States homicide rates ""were 7.0 times higher than in other high-income countries, driven by a gun homicide rate that was 25.2 times higher.""[367] In 2016, the U.S. murder rate was 5.4 per 100,000.[368] Total incarceration in the United States by year (1920–2014) The United States has the highest documented incarceration rate and largest prison population in the world.[369] As of 2020, the Prison Policy Initiative reported that there were some 2.3 million people incarcerated.[370] According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the majority of inmates held in federal prisons are convicted of drug offenses.[371] The imprisonment rate for all prisoners sentenced to more than a year in state or federal facilities is 478 per 100,000 in 2013.[372] About 9% of prisoners are held in privatized prisons,[370] a practice beginning in the 1980s and a subject of contention.[373] Although most nations have abolished capital punishment,[374] it is sanctioned in the United States for certain federal and military crimes, and at the state level in 28 states, though three states have moratoriums on carrying out the penalty imposed by their governors.[375][376][377] In 2019, the country had the sixth-highest number of executions in the world, following China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Egypt.[378] No executions took place from 1967 to 1977, owing in part to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling striking down the practice. Since the decision, however, there have been more than 1,500 executions.[379] In recent years the number of executions and presence of capital punishment statute on whole has trended down nationally, with several states recently abolishing the penalty.[377] Economy Main article: Economy of the United States See also: Economic history of the United States, List of companies of the United States by state, List of largest companies in the United States by revenue, and Lists of companies The New York Stock Exchange on Wall Street is the world's largest stock exchange (per market capitalization of its listed companies)[380] at $23.1 trillion as of April 2018.[381] According to the International Monetary Fund, the U.S. GDP of $22.7 trillion constitutes 24% of the gross world product at market exchange rates and over 16% of the gross world product at purchasing power parity.[382][14] The United States is the largest importer of goods and second-largest exporter,[383] though exports per capita are relatively low. In 2010, the total U.S. trade deficit was $635 billion.[384] Canada, China, Mexico, Japan, and Germany are its top trading partners.[385] From 1983 to 2008, U.S. real compounded annual GDP growth was 3.3%, compared to a 2.3% weighted average for the rest of the G7.[386] The country ranks fifth in the world in nominal GDP per capita[387] and seventh in GDP per capita at PPP.[14] The U.S. dollar is the world's primary reserve currency.[388] In 2009, the private sector was estimated to constitute 86.4% of the economy.[389] While its economy has reached a postindustrial level of development, the United States remains an industrial power.[390] In August 2010, the American labor force consisted of 154.1 million people (50%). With 21.2 million people, government is the leading field of employment. The largest private employment sector is health care and social assistance, with 16.4 million people. It has a smaller welfare state and redistributes less income through government action than most European nations.[391] The United States is the only advanced economy that does not guarantee its workers paid vacation[392] and is one of a few countries in the world without paid family leave as a legal right.[393] 74% of full-time American workers get paid sick leave, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, although only 24% of part-time workers get the same benefits.[394] In 2009, the United States had the third-highest workforce productivity per person in the world, behind Luxembourg and Norway.[395][396] Science and technology Main articles: Science and technology in the United States and Science policy of the United States Buzz Aldrin on the Moon, 1969 The United States has been a leader in technological innovation since the late 19th century and scientific research since the mid-20th century. Methods for producing interchangeable parts were developed by the U.S. War Department by the Federal Armories during the first half of the 19th century. This technology, along with the establishment of a machine tool industry, enabled the U.S. to have large-scale manufacturing of sewing machines, bicycles, and other items in the late 19th century and became known as the American system of manufacturing. Factory electrification in the early 20th century and introduction of the assembly line and other labor-saving techniques created the system of mass production.[397] In the 21st century, approximately two-thirds of research and development funding comes from the private sector.[398] The United States leads the world in scientific research papers and impact factor.[399][400] In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell was awarded the first U.S. patent for the telephone. Thomas Edison's research laboratory, one of the first of its kind, developed the phonograph, the first long-lasting light bulb, and the first viable movie camera.[401] The latter led to emergence of the worldwide entertainment industry. In the early 20th century, the automobile companies of Ransom E. Olds and Henry Ford popularized the assembly line. The Wright brothers, in 1903, made the first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight.[402] The rise of fascism and Nazism in the 1920s and 30s led many European scientists, including Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi, and John von Neumann, to immigrate to the United States.[403] During World War II, the Manhattan Project developed nuclear weapons, ushering in the Atomic Age, while the Space Race produced rapid advances in rocketry, materials science, and aeronautics.[404][405] The invention of the transistor in the 1950s, a key active component in practically all modern electronics, led to many technological developments and a significant expansion of the U.S. technology industry.[406] This, in turn, led to the establishment of many new technology companies and regions around the country such as Silicon Valley in California. Advancements by American microprocessor companies such as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel, along with both computer software and hardware companies such as Adobe Systems, Apple Inc., IBM, Microsoft, and Sun Microsystems, created and popularized the personal computer. The ARPANET was developed in the 1960s to meet Defense Department requirements, and became the first of a series of networks which evolved into the Internet.[407] The United States was ranked third (after Switzerland and Sweden) in the Global Innovation Index in 2019 and 2020.[408][409][410][411] Income, wealth, and poverty Further information: Income in the United States, Poverty in the United States, Affluence in the United States, United States counties by per capita income, and Income inequality in the United States Accounting for 4.24% of the global population, Americans collectively possess 29.4% of the world's total wealth, the largest percentage of any country.[412][413] The U.S. also ranks first in the number of billionaires and millionaires in the world, with 724 billionaires and 10.5 million millionaires as of 2020.[414][415] Prior to the 2019–2021 global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, Credit Suisse listed some 18.6 million U.S. citizens as having a net worth in excess of $1 million.[416] The Global Food Security Index ranked the U.S. number one for food affordability and overall food security in March 2013.[417] Americans on average have more than twice as much living space per dwelling and per person as EU residents.[418] For 2017 the United Nations Development Programme ranked the United States 13th among 189 countries in its Human Development Index (HDI) and 25th among 151 countries in its inequality-adjusted HDI (IHDI).[419] Wealth inequality in the U.S. increased between 1989 and 2013.[420] Wealth, like income and taxes, is highly concentrated; the richest 10% of the adult population possess 72% of the country's household wealth, while the bottom half possess only 2%.[421] According to the Federal Reserve, the top 1% controlled 38.6% of the country's wealth in 2016.[422] In 2017, Forbes found that just three individuals (Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett and Bill Gates) held more money than the bottom half of the population.[423] According to a 2018 study by the OECD, the United States has a larger percentage of low-income workers than almost any other developed nation, largely because of a weak collective bargaining system and lack of government support for at-risk workers.[424] The top one percent of income-earners accounted for 52 percent of the income gains from 2009 to 2015, where income is defined as market income excluding government transfers.[425] After years of stagnation, median household income reached a record high in 2016 following two consecutive years of record growth. Income inequality remains at record highs however, with the top fifth of earners taking home more than half of all overall income.[426] The rise in the share of total annual income received by the top one percent, which has more than doubled from nine percent in 1976 to 20 percent in 2011, has significantly affected income inequality,[427] leaving the United States with one of the widest income distributions among OECD nations.[428] The extent and relevance of income inequality is a matter of debate.[429][430][431] There were about 567,715 sheltered and unsheltered homeless persons in the U.S. in January 2019, with almost two-thirds staying in an emergency shelter or transitional housing program.[432] In 2011, 16.7 million children lived in food-insecure households, about 35% more than 2007 levels, though only 845,000 U.S. children (1.1%) saw reduced food intake or disrupted eating patterns at some point during the year, and most cases were not chronic.[433] As of June 2018[update], 40 million people, roughly 12.7% of the U.S. population, were living in poverty, including 13.3 million children. Of those impoverished, 18.5 million live in deep poverty (family income below one-half of the poverty threshold) and over five million live ""in 'Third World' conditions"".[434] In 2017, the U.S. states or territories with the lowest and highest poverty rates were New Hampshire (7.6%) and American Samoa (65%), respectively.[435][436][437] The economic impact and mass unemployment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic raised fears of a mass eviction crisis,[438] with an analysis by the Aspen Institute indicating that between 30 and 40 million people were at risk for eviction by the end of 2020.[439] Infrastructure Transportation Main article: Transportation in the United States The Interstate Highway System in the contiguous states, which extends 46,876 miles (75,440 km)[440] Personal transportation is dominated by automobiles, which operate on a network of 4 million miles (6.4 million kilometers) of public roads.[441] The United States has the world's second-largest automobile market,[442] and has the highest vehicle ownership per capita in the world, with 816.4 vehicles per 1,000 Americans (2014).[443] In 2017, there were 255,009,283 non-two wheel motor vehicles, or about 910 vehicles per 1,000 people.[444] The civil airline industry is entirely privately owned and has been largely deregulated since 1978, while most major airports are publicly owned.[445] The three largest airlines in the world by passengers carried are U.S.-based; American Airlines is number one after its 2013 acquisition by US Airways.[446] Of the world's 50 busiest passenger airports, 16 are in the United States, including the busiest, Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport.[447] The United States has the longest rail network in the world, nearly all standard gauge. The network handles mostly freight, with intercity passenger service provided by the government-subsidized Amtrak to all but four states.[448] Transport is the largest single source of greenhouse gas emissions by the United States, which are the second highest by country, exceeded only by China's.[449] The United States has historically been the world's largest producer of greenhouse gases, and greenhouse gas emissions per capita remain high.[450] Energy Further information: Energy policy of the United States The United States energy market is about 29,000 terawatt hours per year.[451] In 2018, 37% of this energy came from petroleum, 31% from natural gas, and 13% from coal. The remainder was supplied by nuclear and renewable energy sources.[452] Culture Main article: Culture of the United States For many immigrants, the Statue of Liberty was their first view of the United States. It signified new opportunities in life, and thus the statue is an iconic symbol of the American Dream as well as its ideals.[453] The United States is home to many cultures and a wide variety of ethnic groups, traditions, and values.[454][455] Aside from the Native American, Native Hawaiian, and Native Alaskan populations, nearly all Americans or their ancestors immigrated or were imported as slaves within the past five centuries.[456] Mainstream American culture is a Western culture largely derived from the traditions of European immigrants with influences from many other sources, such as traditions brought by slaves from Africa.[454][457] More recent immigration from Asia and especially Latin America has added to a cultural mix that has been described as both a homogenizing melting pot, and a heterogeneous salad bowl in which immigrants and their descendants retain distinctive cultural characteristics.[454] Americans have traditionally been characterized by a strong work ethic, competitiveness, and individualism,[458] as well as a unifying belief in an ""American creed"" emphasizing liberty, equality, private property, democracy, rule of law, and a preference for limited government.[459] Americans are extremely charitable by global standards: according to a 2006 British study, Americans gave 1.67% of GDP to charity, more than any other nation studied.[460][461][462] The American Dream, or the perception that Americans enjoy high social mobility, plays a key role in attracting immigrants.[463] Whether this perception is accurate has been a topic of debate.[464][465][466] While mainstream culture holds that the United States is a classless society,[467] scholars identify significant differences between the country's social classes, affecting socialization, language, and values.[468] Americans tend to greatly value socioeconomic achievement, but being ordinary or average is also generally seen as a positive attribute.[469] Literature, philosophy, and visual art Main articles: American literature, American philosophy, Architecture of the United States, and Visual art of the United States Mark Twain, American author and humorist In the 18th and early 19th centuries, American art and literature took most of its cues from Europe. Writers such as Washington Irving, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Edgar Allan Poe, and Henry David Thoreau established a distinctive American literary voice by the middle of the 19th century. Mark Twain and poet Walt Whitman were major figures in the century's second half; Emily Dickinson, virtually unknown during her lifetime, is now recognized as an essential American poet.[470] A work seen as capturing fundamental aspects of the national experience and character—such as Herman Melville's Moby-Dick (1851), Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1885), F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby (1925) and Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird (1960)—may be dubbed the ""Great American Novel.""[471] Thirteen U.S. citizens have won the Nobel Prize in Literature. William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway and John Steinbeck are often named among the most influential writers of the 20th century.[472] Popular literary genres such as the Western and hardboiled crime fiction developed in the United States. The Beat Generation writers opened up new literary approaches, as have postmodernist authors such as John Barth, Thomas Pynchon, and Don DeLillo.[473] The transcendentalists, led by Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson, established the first major American philosophical movement. After the Civil War, Charles Sanders Peirce and then William James and John Dewey were leaders in the development of pragmatism. In the 20th century, the work of W. V. O. Quine and Richard Rorty, and later Noam Chomsky, brought analytic philosophy to the fore of American philosophical academia. John Rawls and Robert Nozick also led a revival of political philosophy. In the visual arts, the Hudson River School was a mid-19th-century movement in the tradition of European naturalism. The 1913 Armory Show in New York City, an exhibition of European modernist art, shocked the public and transformed the U.S. art scene.[474] Georgia O'Keeffe, Marsden Hartley, and others experimented with new, individualistic styles. Major artistic movements such as the abstract expressionism of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning and the pop art of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein developed largely in the United States. The tide of modernism and then postmodernism has brought fame to American architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Philip Johnson, and Frank Gehry.[475] Americans have long been important in the modern artistic medium of photography, with major photographers including Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, Edward Weston, and Ansel Adams.[476] Food Main article: Cuisine of the United States Roasted turkey is a traditional menu item of an American Thanksgiving dinner.[477] Early settlers were introduced by Native Americans to such indigenous, non-European foods as turkey, sweet potatoes, corn, squash, and maple syrup. They and later immigrants combined these with foods they had known, such as wheat flour,[478] beef, and milk to create a distinctive American cuisine.[479][480] Homegrown foods are part of a shared national menu on one of America's most popular holidays, Thanksgiving, when some Americans make traditional foods to celebrate the occasion.[481] The American fast food industry, the world's largest,[482] pioneered the drive-through format in the 1940s.[483] Characteristic dishes such as apple pie, fried chicken, pizza, hamburgers, and hot dogs derive from the recipes of various immigrants.[484][485] French fries, Mexican dishes such as burritos and tacos, and pasta dishes freely adapted from Italian sources are widely consumed.[486] Americans drink three times as much coffee as tea.[487] Marketing by U.S. industries is largely responsible for making orange juice and milk ubiquitous breakfast beverages.[488][489] Music Main articles: Music of the United States and American classical music Grammy Museum at L.A. Live Among America's earliest composers was a man named William Billings who, born in Boston, composed patriotic hymns in the 1770s;[490] Billings was a part of the First New England School, who dominated American music during its earliest stages. Anthony Heinrich was the most prominent composer before the Civil War. From the mid-late 1800s John Philip Sousa of the late Romantic era, composed numerous military songs—particularly marches—and is regarded as one of America's greatest composers.[491] By the late 19th century, the Second New England School (sometimes referred to specifically as the ""Boston Six"") became prominent representatives of the classical tradition, of whom John Knowles Paine was the leading figure. Although little known at the time, Charles Ives's work of the 1910s established him as the first major U.S. composer in the classical tradition, while experimentalists such as Henry Cowell and John Cage created a distinctive American approach to classical composition. Aaron Copland and George Gershwin—eventually furthered by Leonard Bernstein—developed a new synthesis of popular and classical music. The rhythmic and lyrical styles of African-American music have deeply influenced American music at large, distinguishing it from European and African traditions. Elements from folk idioms such as the blues and what is now known as old-time music were adopted and transformed into popular genres with global audiences. Jazz was developed by innovators such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington early in the 20th century. Country music developed in the 1920s, and rhythm and blues in the 1940s.[492] Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry were among the mid-1950s pioneers of rock and roll. Rock bands such as Metallica, the Eagles, and Aerosmith are among the highest grossing in worldwide sales.[493][494][495] In the 1960s, Bob Dylan emerged from the folk revival to become one of America's most celebrated songwriters and James Brown led the development of funk. More recent American creations include hip hop, salsa, techno, and house music. Mid-20th-century American pop stars such as Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra,[496] and Elvis Presley became global celebrities,[492] as have artists of the late 20th century such as Michael Jackson, Prince, Madonna and Whitney Houston.[497][498] Popular artists from the mid-1990s to late 2000s include Mariah Carey, Britney Spears, Justin Timberlake, Christina Aguilera and Beyoncé. Well-known American singers of the 2010s include Katy Perry, Bruno Mars, Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande.[499][500] Cinema Main article: Cinema of the United States The Hollywood Sign in Los Angeles, California Hollywood, a northern district of Los Angeles, California, is one of the leaders in motion picture production.[501] The world's first commercial motion picture exhibition was given in New York City in 1894, using Thomas Edison's Kinetoscope.[502] Since the early 20th century, the U.S. film industry has largely been based in and around Hollywood, although in the 21st century an increasing number of films are not made there, and film companies have been subject to the forces of globalization.[503] Director D. W. Griffith, an American filmmaker during the silent film period, was central to the development of film grammar, and producer/entrepreneur Walt Disney was a leader in both animated film and movie merchandising.[504] Directors such as John Ford redefined the image of the American Old West, and, like others such as John Huston, broadened the possibilities of cinema with location shooting. The industry enjoyed its golden years, in what is commonly referred to as the ""Golden Age of Hollywood"", from the early sound period until the early 1960s,[505] with screen actors such as John Wayne and Marilyn Monroe becoming iconic figures.[506][507] In the 1970s, ""New Hollywood"" or the ""Hollywood Renaissance""[508] was defined by grittier films influenced by French and Italian realist pictures of the post-war period.[509] In more recent times, directors such as Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and James Cameron have gained renown for their blockbuster films, often characterized by high production costs and earnings. Notable films topping the American Film Institute's AFI 100 list include Orson Welles's Citizen Kane (1941), which is frequently cited as the greatest film of all time,[510][511] Casablanca (1942), The Godfather (1972), Gone with the Wind (1939), Lawrence of Arabia (1962), The Wizard of Oz (1939), The Graduate (1967), On the Waterfront (1954), Schindler's List (1993), Singin' in the Rain (1952), It's a Wonderful Life (1946) and Sunset Boulevard (1950).[512] The Academy Awards, popularly known as the Oscars, have been held annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences since 1929,[513] and the Golden Globe Awards have been held annually since January 1944.[514] Sports Main article: Sports in the United States The most popular sports in the U.S. are American football, basketball, baseball and ice hockey.[515] American football is by several measures the most popular spectator sport in the United States;[516] the National Football League (NFL) has the highest average attendance of any sports league in the world, and the Super Bowl is watched by tens of millions globally.[517] Even on the collegiate level, college football games receive millions of viewers per television broadcast; most notably the College Football Playoff, which averages 25 million viewers.[518] Baseball has been regarded as the U.S. national sport since the late 19th century, with Major League Baseball (MLB) being the top league. Basketball and ice hockey are the country's next two leading professional team sports, with the top leagues being the National Basketball Association (NBA)[519] and the National Hockey League (NHL). College football and basketball attract large audiences. The NCAA Final Four is one of the most watched sporting events.[520] In soccer (a sport that has gained a footing in the United States since the mid-1990s), the country hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup, the men's national soccer team qualified for ten World Cups and the women's team has won the FIFA Women's World Cup four times; Major League Soccer is the sport's highest league in the United States (featuring 23 American and three Canadian teams).[521] The market for professional sports in the United States is roughly $69 billion, roughly 50% larger than that of all of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa combined.[522] Eight Olympic Games have taken place in the United States. The 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri, were the first-ever Olympic Games held outside of Europe.[523] As of 2017[update], the United States has won 2,522 medals at the Summer Olympic Games, more than any other country, and 305 in the Winter Olympic Games, the second most behind Norway.[524] While most major U.S. sports such as baseball and American football have evolved out of European practices, basketball, volleyball, skateboarding, and snowboarding are American inventions, some of which have become popular worldwide.[525] Lacrosse and surfing arose from Native American and Native Hawaiian activities that predate Western contact.[526] The most-watched individual sports are golf and auto racing, particularly NASCAR and IndyCar.[527][528] Mass media Further information: Mass media in the United States See also: Newspapers in the United States, Television in the United States, Internet in the United States, and Radio in the United States The headquarters of the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City The four major broadcasters in the U.S. are the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), American Broadcasting Company (ABC), and Fox Broadcasting Company (FOX). The four major broadcast television networks are all commercial entities. Cable television offers hundreds of channels catering to a variety of niches.[529] Americans listen to radio programming, also largely commercial, on average just over two-and-a-half hours a day.[530] In 1998, the number of U.S. commercial radio stations had grown to 4,793 AM stations and 5,662 FM stations. In addition, there are 1,460 public radio stations. Most of these stations are run by universities and public authorities for educational purposes and are financed by public or private funds, subscriptions, and corporate underwriting. Much public radio broadcasting is supplied by NPR.[531] NPR was incorporated in February 1970 under the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967; its television counterpart, PBS, was created by the same legislation. As of September 30, 2014[update], there are 15,433 licensed full-power radio stations in the U.S. according to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC).[532] Well-known newspapers include The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, and USA Today.[533] Although the cost of publishing has increased over the years, the price of newspapers has generally remained low, forcing newspapers to rely more on advertising revenue and on articles provided by a major wire service, such as the Associated Press or Reuters, for their national and world coverage.[534] With very few exceptions, all the newspapers in the U.S. are privately owned, either by large chains such as Gannett or McClatchy, which own dozens or even hundreds of newspapers; by small chains that own a handful of papers; or in a situation that is increasingly rare, by individuals or families. Major cities often have ""alternative weeklies"" to complement the mainstream daily papers, such as New York City's The Village Voice or Los Angeles' LA Weekly. Major cities may also support a local business journal, trade papers relating to local industries, and papers for local ethnic and social groups. Aside from web portals and search engines, the most popular websites are Facebook, YouTube, Wikipedia, Yahoo!, eBay, Amazon, and Twitter.[535] More than 800 publications are produced in Spanish, the second most commonly used language in the United States behind English.[536][537] See also North America portal United States portal Index of United States–related articles Lists of U.S. state topics Outline of the United States Notes ^ English is the official language of 32 states; English and Hawaiian are both official languages in Hawaii, and English and 20 Indigenous languages are official in Alaska. Algonquian, Cherokee, and Sioux are among many other official languages in Native-controlled lands throughout the country. French is a de facto, but unofficial, language in Maine and Louisiana, while New Mexico law grants Spanish a special status. In five territories, English as well as one or more indigenous languages are official: Spanish in Puerto Rico, Samoan in American Samoa, and Chamorro in both Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands. Carolinian is also an official language in the Northern Mariana Islands.[6][7] ^ Current results are not directly comparable to past results, due to changes in methodology. ^ The historical and informal demonym Yankee has been applied to Americans, New Englanders, or northeasterners since the 18th century. ^ a b c The United States is the third-largest country, after Canada, if coastal and territorial waters are included. If excluded, it is the fourth-largest, after China. Coastal/territorial waters included: 3,796,742 sq mi (9,833,517 km2)[20] Coastal/territorial waters excluded: 3,696,100 sq mi (9,572,900 km2)[21] ^ Excludes Puerto Rico and the other unincorporated islands because they are counted separately in U.S. census statistics. ^ See Time in the United States for details about laws governing time zones in the United States. ^ A single jurisdiction, the U.S. Virgin Islands, uses left-hand traffic. ^ Country code top-level domains are generally not used in the U.S.[citation needed] ^ .um was removed by ICANN in 2008, but is still recognized by the U.S. government as a country code top-level domain.[citation needed] ^ The five major territories are American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands. There are eleven smaller island areas without permanent populations: Baker Island, Howland Island, Jarvis Island, Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef, Midway Atoll, and Palmyra Atoll. U.S. sovereignty over Bajo Nuevo Bank, Navassa Island, Serranilla Bank, and Wake Island is disputed.[19] ^ Inupiaq, Siberian Yupik, Central Alaskan Yup'ik, Alutiiq, Unanga (Aleut), Denaʼina, Deg Xinag, Holikachuk, Koyukon, Upper Kuskokwim, Gwichʼin, Tanana, Upper Tanana, Tanacross, Hän, Ahtna, Eyak, Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian. ^ People born in American Samoa are non-citizen U.S. nationals, unless one of their parents is a U.S. citizen.[309] In 2019, a court ruled that American Samoans are U.S. citizens, but the litigation is onging.[310][311] References ^ 36 U.S.C. § 302 ^ a b c d ""The Great Seal of the United States"" (PDF).

The world’s population is becoming increasingly urbanised. According to a UN study, an extra 2.5 billion people could be living in towns and cities by 2050, meaning 68% of the global population will be residing in urban spaces. With this worldwide population shift putting pressure on city infrastructure, efficient use of space will be paramount in any successful urban planning and development. It is here that a new system designed by German specialist engineering company TK Elevator could help architects unlock a building’s full potential. The development team for the omnidirectional MULTI elevator are confident their system will enable architects to offer more floorspace in their designs thanks to a reduction in the number of lift shafts within any building. Traditional elevators work by balancing a loaded lift car within a shaft with a counterweight attached by a rope or cable. When the elevator car rises the counterweight descends. In many cases the counterweight can be replaced with a second lift car – which effectively becomes the counterweight. These systems have barely changed for over 150 years and have limited building’s design scope as they can only operate a single car in each shaft. As the height of buildings has increased so the requirement to add extra lift shafts to allow passengers to travel quickly and efficiently through the structure has risen, impacting the amount of floor space available. Unbound by the limitations of traditional lift shafts, the MULTI system allows architects to truly innovate on building design Thanks to its innovative rail design, the MULTI car system enables several elevator cars to circulate around a building rather than the two-car limit that most systems have. This ensures that dedicated cores are used more efficiently, reducing the need for multiple lift shafts while maintaining an efficient service for passengers. The system works on a steel-built magnetic mechanism similar to that developed to propel high-speed trains in Japan. Electrical steel is at the heart of the electromagnetic motors that power the MULTI system. Electrical steel’s properties allow for the generation of a significantly higher flux density than alternative materials, which increases the torque of the motor. This special steel increases the power of the system’s magnetic field and its high strength-to-weight ratio allows for smaller, lighter motors. The MULTI moves along a set of steel rails that can be fixed vertically, horizontally – or even diagonally – on the wall of the elevator shaft throughout a building. Each lift car utilises its own linear motor technology to propel itself along these rails. By keeping all the cars moving in a continuous loop along the magnetic rail system, MULTI can recover energy from descending cabs and instantly redistribute that energy onto tracks where ascending or horizontal movement is required. This smart aspect of the MULTI system allows architects not simply to rethink the design of their buildings, but also approach mobility and energy use from a completely fresh perspective. In the back of each car a ‘sledge’ features a cluster of roller guides, a permanent magnet, brake and emergency fail-safe braking system. This sledge sits on the guide rails which boast coil units, energy and data transmission units that allows for precise coordination with other cars. These enable the car to travel at a targeted speed of 6m/s. This high travel speed will enable near-constant access to an elevator every 15-30 seconds, reducing wait times and improving mobility in large crowded buildings. Built from high-strength steel, each lightweight car contains its own linear motor system The high-strength steel-built exchange system allows for safe, simple and efficient switching between vertical and horizontal movement ‹› But key to the MULTI system’s operation is the unit which enables the car to pivot and change direction from travelling in the vertical plane to horizontal. The ‘exchanger’ unit features a locking device and a rotation drive which at the given vertical/horizontal track interchange locks onto the cab sledge, rotating it to the horizontal, enabling the lift car to travel in that direction. The lift cabins are of lightweight design with high-strength steel playing an integral role in the fabrication of the sledge and exchanger, as well as the rails. The exchanger system must be particularly durable as the continuous use of the switching process places the junctions under high mechanical stress. “From an engineering point of view, it is the exchanger that is key to the MULTI system,” explains TK Elevator’s Michael Ridder, “It is that which enables the safe circulation of multiple cars within a building.” In theory the system gives designers the option to look beyond the confines of a building’s envelope and create a passenger transport system that is capable of linking buildings and even city districts. In Berlin the MULTI system is due to be installed at the EDGE East Side development, a 36-storey office and commercial space development alongside the Mercedes-Benz Arena and Warschauer Straße station. It is scheduled to be completed in 2023 and until then the only working installation of the MULTI system has been at the company’s 250m high test tower at Rottweil in south west Germany, specifically built to put the MULTI elevator through its paces, although there are several other installations that are currently under negotiation. “The MULTI is the next stage in the evolution of the design of elevators. It will open up new possibilities for building designers and architects,” says Mr Ridder.

Our Mission As our mission the UNION will assist Member Institutions in their dealings with national policy and represent the interests of SMEs at International and UN- Organisations based on professional analysis of actual situations and the challenges and problems of SMEs in the 21st Century. Thus the UNION will efficiently contribute to present proposals for solutions and reforms on regional level that can improve the business environment for SMEs in the sense of the World Bank Group “Ease of Doing Business”. Establish itself as the premier international organisation advocating the interests of micro-small and medium enterprises (SMEs) at relevant international fora, before all national, regional and international bodies and with leading media that shape public opinion. Perform as a strategic resource for SMEs and the organisations that represent them world-wide, with focus on those in developing and less developed economies. Facilitate access of SMEs to know-how and best practices, through training, technology transfer and other business development services that will enable SMEs to develop their techno-economic capability, modernise their management skills, support proper use of the intellectual property system, improve their information system and knowledge of e-business. Foster international cooperation, encourage SMEs' linkages among SMEs and Governments, institutions, initiate formation of business alliances; and create mechanisms to facilitate cost-effective international networking and international trade opportunities for SMEs to enable them to reap the benefits of globalization. Provide leadership and be a catalyst for building a supporting and synergistic network of civil society institutions so as to make SMEs competitive, sustainable, environmentally friendly, socially responsive, culturally sensitive and ethical in their business relationships. Our Values The WORLD UNION SMEs trusts in the principles of freedom and responsibility of entrepreneurs and in developing the environment and social conditions world wide by market mechanisms and social partnership.

OverviewSmall and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) play a major role in most economies, particularly in developing countries. SMEs account for the majority of businesses worldwide and are important contributors to job creation and global economic development. They represent about 90% of businesses and more than 50% of employment worldwide. Formal SMEs contribute up to 40% of national income (GDP) in emerging economies. These numbers are significantly higher when informal SMEs are included.  According to our estimates, 600 million jobs will be needed by 2030 to absorb the growing global workforce, which makes SME development a high priority for many governments around the world. In emerging markets, most formal jobs are generated by SMEs, which create 7 out of 10 jobs. However, access to finance is a key constraint to SME growth, it is the second most cited obstacle facing SMEs to grow their businesses in emerging markets and developing countries. image SMEs are less likely to be able to obtain bank loans than large firms; instead, they rely on internal funds, or cash from friends and family, to launch and initially run their enterprises. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) estimates that 65 million firms, or 40% of formal micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in developing countries, have an unmet financing need of $5.2 trillion every year, which is equivalent to 1.4 times the current level of the global MSME lending. East Asia And Pacific accounts for the largest share (46%) of the total global finance gap and is followed by Latin America and the Caribbean (23%) and Europe and Central Asia (15%). The gap volume varies considerably region to region. Latin America and the Caribbean and the Middle East and North Africa regions, in particular, have the highest proportion of the finance gap compared to potential demand, measured at 87% and 88%, respectively. About half of formal SMEs don’t have access to formal credit. The financing gap is even larger when micro and informal enterprises are taken into account. Formal MSME Finance Gap in Developing Countries What We DoA key area of the World Bank Group’s work is to improve SMEs’ access to finance and find innovative solutions to unlock sources of capital.Our approach is holistic, combining advisory and lending services to clients to increase the contribution that SMEs can make to the economy including underserved segments such as women owned SMEs.Advisory and Policy Support for SME finance mainly includes diagnostics, implementation support, global advocacy and knowledge sharing of good practice. For example we provide;Financial sector assessments to determine areas of improvement in regulatory and policy aspects enabling increased responsible SME access to finance Implementation support of initiatives such as development of enabling environment, design and set up of credit guarantee schemesImproving credit infrastructure (credit reporting systems, secured transactions and collateral registries, and insolvency regimes) which can lead to greater SME access to finance.Introducing innovation in SME finance such as e-lending platforms, use of alternative data for credit decisioning, e-invoicing, e-factoring and supply chain financing.Policy work, analytical work, and other Advisory Services can also be provided in support of SME finance activities.Advocacy for SME finance at global level through participating and supporting G20 Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion, Financial Stability Board, International Credit Committee for Credit Reporting on SME Finance related issues.Knowledge management tools and flagship publications on good practice, successful models and policy frameworksLending Operations:SME Lines of Credit provide dedicated bank financing – frequently for longer tenors than are generally available in the market – to support SMEs for investment, growth, export, and diversification.Partial Credit Guarantee Schemes (PCGs) – the design of PCGs is crucial to SMEs’ success, and support can be provided to design and capitalize such facilities.Early Stage Innovation Finance provides equity and debt/quasi-debt to start up or high growth firms which may otherwise not be able to access bank financing.Results of Our WorkEarly-Stage SME FinanceIn Lebanon, the Innovative Small and Medium Enterprises (iSME) project is a $30 million investment lending operation providing equity co-investments in innovative young firms in addition to a grant funding window for seed stage firms. As of August 2019, iSME’s co-investment fund has invested $10.23 million across 22 investments and has been able to leverage $25.47 million in co-financing, demonstrating its ability to crowd in private sector financing and expand the market for early stage equity finance in Lebanon. To date, 60 out of 174 grantees had leveraged the iSME funding to raise a total of $13.1 million from various funding sources, a leverage ratio of 5.3 times. Overall, stakeholders’ consultations suggest that the iSME project could play an even larger role in the future financing of the Venture Capital (VC) sector by supporting existing VCs and emerging players, including increasing attention on a fund of funds approach, which could also cover growth funds (later stage and private equity). In India, our MSME Growth, Innovation and Inclusive Finance Project improved access to finance for MSMEs in three vital but underserved segments: early stage/startups, services, and manufacturing. A credit line of $500 million, provided to the Small Industry Development Bank of India (SIDBI), was designed to provide an affordable longer-term source of funding for underserved MSMEs. Technical assistance of about $3.7 million complemented the lending component and focused on capacity building of SIDBI and the participating financial institutions (PFIs). In addition to directly financing MSMEs, disbursing a total of $265 million in loans, the project pushed the frontiers of MSME financing through the development of innovative lending methods that reduced turnaround time, reached more underserved MSMEs, and crowded in more private sector financing. It also reached new clients, women-owned MSMEs, and MSMEs in low-income states. The project supported SIDBI to scale-up of the Fund of Funds for Startups, which aims to indirectly disburse $1.5 billion to startups by 2025. SIDBI’s “contactless lending” platform, a digital MSME lending aggregator and matchmaking platform, has crowded in $1.9 billion of private sector financing for MSMEs, making it the largest online lender in India.Lines of CreditIn Jordan, two World Bank Group’s lines of credit aim to increase access to finance for MSMEs and ultimately contribute to job creation. The $70 million line of credit encouraged the growth and expansion of new and existing enterprises, increasing outreach to MSMEs, 58% of which were located outside of Amman and 73% were managed by women. The line of credit directed 22% of total funds to start-ups. The project financed 8,149 MSMEs, creating 7,682 jobs, of which 79% employed youth and 42% hired women. The additional financing of $50 Million is progressing well towards achieving its intended objective. $45.2 million has been on-lent to 3,345 MSMEs through nine participating banks. The project is especially benefiting women, who represent 77% of project beneficiaries, and youth (48% of project beneficiaries), and increasing geographical outreach, as 65% of MSMEs are in Governorates outside of Amman.In Nigeria, the Development Finance Project supports the establishment of the Development Bank of Nigeria (DBN), a wholesale development finance institution that will provide long-term financing and partial credit guarantees to eligible financial intermediaries for on-lending to MSMEs. The project also includes technical assistance to DBN and participating commercial banks in support of downscaling their operations to the underserved MSME segment. As of May 2019, the Development Bank of Nigeria credit line to PFIs for on-lending to MSMEs has disbursed US$243.7 million, reaching nearly 50,000 end-borrowers, of which 70% were women, through 7 banks and 10 microfinance banks.Partial Credit GuaranteesIn Morocco, the MSME Development project aimed to improve access to finance for MSMEs by supporting the provision of credit guarantees by enabling the provider of partial credit guarantees in the Moroccan financial system to scale up its existing MSME guarantee products and introduce a new guarantee product geared towards the very small enterprises (VSEs). As a result of the project, the number and volume of MSME loans are estimated to have increased by 88% and 18%, respectively, since the end of 2011. Cumulative volume of loans backed by the guarantees during the life of the project is estimated at $3.28 billion. With significantly increased lending supported by guarantees, PFIs were able to continue building their knowledge of MSME customers, refining their systems to serve them more effectively and efficiently. Owing to guarantees, many first-time borrowers were able to generate credit history, which made it easier for them to obtain loans in future.Supporting Women-Owned SMEsIn Ethiopia, the Women Entrepreneurship Development Project (WEDP) is an IDA operation providing loans and business training for growth-oriented women entrepreneurs in Ethiopia. After identifying a persistent ‘missing middle’ financing gap for women entrepreneurs in Ethiopia, WEDP launched as a microfinance institutions’ (MFIs) upscaling operation, helping Ethiopia’s leading MFIs introduce larger, individual-liability loan products tailored to women entrepreneurs. WEDP loans are complemented through provision of innovative, mindset-oriented business training to women entrepreneurs. As of October 2019, more than 14,000 women entrepreneurs took loans and over 20,000 participated in business training provided by WEDP.  66% of WEDP clients were first-time borrowers. As a result of the project, participating MFIs increased the average loan size by 870% to $11,500, reduced the collateral requirements from an average of 200% of the value of the loan to 125%, and started disbursing $30.2 million of their own funds as WEDP loans. The average WEDP loan has resulted in an increase of over 40% in annual profits and nearly 56% in net employment for Ethiopian women entrepreneurs. In Bangladesh, the Access to Finance for Women SMEs Project aims to create an enabling environment to expand access to finance to women SMEs (WSME) by supporting the establishment of credit guarantee scheme (CGS), issuance of SME Finance Policy, and strengthening capacity of the regulator and sector. The project supported the issuance of Bangladesh’s maiden SME Finance Policy: stepping stone for boosting SME financing. Bangladesh’s first comprehensive SME Finance Policy was launched in September 2019 through concerted efforts in high-level upstream work, enhancement of the regulator’s capacity, and formulation of key recommendations with a sharper gender lens. In Bangladesh, $2.8 billion financing gap prevails in the MSME sector, where 60% of women SME’s financing needs are unmet, and lack of access to collateral is one of the key hindrances. Bangladesh lacked a single policy with systemic plan to enhance SME finance. With nearly 10 million SMEs contributing to 23% of the GDP, 80% of jobs in the industries sector and 25% of the total labor force, the SME Finance Policy will play a pivotal role in enhance SME financing.LeasingIn Ethiopia and Guinea, the World Bank Group is supporting the local governments in creating an enabling framework which is conducive to launching and growing leasing operations, as well as attracting investors, to increase access to finance for SMEs. It is doing so by working at the macro, mezzo, and micro levels, supporting the governments with legal and regulatory reforms, and working with industry players to create technical partnerships and increase market awareness and capacity. In Ethiopia, the project generated a $200 million credit facility supporting 7 leasing intuitions and introducing 4 new leasing products into the market: hire purchase, finance lease, microleasing and agrileasing. As of June 2019, 7,186 MSMEs have accessed finance valued at over $147 million. The project in Guinea supported the adoption of the national leasing law and the accompanying prudential guidelines for leasing, which in turn, have helped 3 companies to launch leasing operations. To date, these institutions have supported 31 SMEs through the disbursement of leases valued at $25 million.Who We Work WithLeveraging our expert knowledge, we work globally with public stakeholders and private sector intermediaries in partnership with other multilateral and bilateral development organizations to support SME Finance development in emerging markets and developing countries.

43,"Small and medium-sized enterprises - Wikipedia Small and medium-sized enterprises From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) or small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) are businesses whose personnel numbers fall below certain limits. The abbreviation ""SME"" is used by international organizations such as the World Bank, the European Union, the United Nations and the World Trade Organization (WTO). In any given national economy, SMEs sometimes outnumber large companies by a wide margin and also employ many more people.[1] For example, Australian SMEs make up 98% of all Australian businesses, produce one-third of the total GDP and employ 4.7 million people. In Chile, in the commercial year 2014, 98.5% of the firms were classified as SMEs.[2] In Tunisia, the self-employed workers alone account for about 28% of the total non-farm employment and firms with fewer than 100 employees account for about 62% of total employment.[3] The United States' SMEs generate half of all U.S. jobs, but only 40% of GDP.[4] In developing countries, smaller (micro) and informal firms, have a larger share[of what?] than in developed countries.[citation needed][5] SMEs are also said[by whom?] to be responsible for driving innovation and competition in many[which?] economic sectors. Although they create more new jobs than large firms, SMEs also suffer the majority of job destruction/contraction.[6] Contents 1 Overview 2 Legal boundary on SMEs around the world 2.1 Africa 2.1.1 Egypt 2.1.2 Kenya 2.1.3 Nigeria 2.1.4 Somalia 2.1.5 South Africa 2.2 Asia 2.2.1 India 2.2.2 Indonesia 2.2.3 Bangladesh 2.2.4 Singapore 2.3 Europe 2.3.1 European Union 2.3.2 Poland 2.3.3 United Kingdom 2.3.4 Switzerland 2.4 North America 2.4.1 Canada 2.4.2 Mexico 2.4.3 United States 2.5 Oceania 2.5.1 Australia 2.5.2 New Zealand 3 See also 4 References 5 External links Overview[edit] This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (January 2017) SMEs are important for economic and social reasons, given the sectors role in employment. Due to their sizes, SME are heavily influenced by their Chief Executive Officer, a.k.a. CEOs. The CEOs of SMEs often are the founders, owners, and manager of the SMEs. The duties of the CEO in SME are difficult, and mirror those of the CEO of a large company: the CEO needs to strategically allocate her/his time, energy, and assets to direct the SMEs. Typically, the CEO is the strategist, champion and leader for developing the SME or the prime reason for the business failing[citation needed]. This definition is provided in Section 7 of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006 (MSMED Act) and was notified in September 2006. The Act provides for classification of enterprises based on their investment size and the nature of the activity undertaken by that enterprise. As per MSMED Act, enterprises are classified into two categories - manufacturing enterprises and service enterprises. For each of these categories, a definition is given to explain what constitutes a micro enterprise or a small enterprise or a medium enterprise. What is not coming under the above three categories would be considered as a large scale enterprise in India. At the employee level, Petrakis and Kostis (2012) explore the role of interpersonal trust and knowledge in the number of small and medium enterprises. They conclude that knowledge positively affects the number of SMEs, which in turn, positively affects interpersonal trust. Note that the empirical results indicate that interpersonal trust does not affect the number of SMEs. Therefore, although knowledge development can reinforce SMEs, trust becomes widespread in a society when the number of SMEs is greater.[7] Legal boundary on SMEs around the world[edit] Multilateral organizations have been criticized for using one measure for all.[8][9] The legal boundary of SMEs around the world vary, and below is a list of the upper limits of SMEs in some countries. Africa[edit] This section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (May 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Egypt[edit] Most of Egypt's businesses are small-sized, with 97 percent employing fewer than 10 workers, according to census data released by state-run statistics body CAPMAS. Medium-sized enterprises with 10 to 50 employees account for around 2.7 percent of total businesses. However, big businesses with over 50 employees account for 0.4 percent of all enterprises nationwide. The data is part of Egypt's 2012/13 economic census on establishments ranging from small stalls to big enterprises. Economic activity outside the establishments – like street vendors and farmers, for example – were excluded from the census. The results show that Egypt is greatly lacking in medium-sized businesses. Seventy percent of the country's 24 million businesses have only one or two employees. But less than 0.1 percent – only 784 businesses – employ between 45 and 49 people. Kenya[edit] In Kenya, the term changed to MSME, which stands for ""micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises"". For micro-enterprises, the minimum number of employees is up to 10 employees. For small enterprises, it is from 10 to 50. For medium enterprises, it is from 50 to 100. no Nigeria[edit] The Central Bank of Nigeria defines small and medium enterprises in Nigeria according to asset base and number of staff employed. The criteria are an asset base that is between N5 million to N500 million, and a staff strength that is between 11 and 100 employees.[citation needed][10] Somalia[edit] In Somalia, the term is SME (for ""small, medium, and micro enterprises""); elsewhere in Africa, MSME stands for ""micro, small, and medium enterprises"". An SME is defined as a small business that has more than 30 employees but less than 250 employees. South Africa[edit] In the National Small Business Amendment Act 2004,[11] micro-businesses in the different sectors, varying from the manufacturing to the retail sectors, are defined as businesses with five or fewer employees and a turnover of up to R100,000 ZAR. Very small businesses employ between 6 and 20 employees, while small businesses employ between 21 and 50 employees. The upper limit for turnover in a small business varies from R1 million in the Agricultural sector to R13 million in the Catering, Accommodations and other Trade sectors as well as in the Manufacturing sector, with a maximum of R32 million in the Wholesale Trade sector. Medium-sized businesses usually employ up to 200 people (100 in the Agricultural sector), and the maximum turnover varies from R5 million in the Agricultural sector to R51 million in the Manufacturing sector and R64 million in the Wholesale Trade, Commercial Agents and Allied Services sector. A comprehensive definition of an SME in South Africa is, therefore, an enterprise with one or more of the following characteristics: Fewer than 200 employees, Annual turnover of less than R64 million, Capital assets of less than R10 million, Direct managerial involvement by owners[12] Asia[edit] India[edit] India defines Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises based on dual criteria of Investment and Turnover. In June 2020, India has updated the definition as follows:[13] Sr No Classification Criteria (in ₹) 1 Micro Enterprises Investment <= 1 cr and Turnover <= 5 cr 2 Small Enterprises Investment <= 10 cr and Turnover <= 50 cr 3 Medium Enterprises Investment <= 50 cr and Turnover <= 250 cr Businesses that are declared as MSMEs and within specific sectors and criteria can then apply for ""priority sector"" lending to help with business expenses; banks have annual targets set by the Prime Minister's Task Force on MSMEs for year-on-year increases of lending to various categories of MSMEs.[14] MSME is considered key contributor in India's growth and contribute 48% in India's total export.[15] Indonesia[edit] In Indonesia, the government defines micro, small, and medium enterprises (Indonesian: usaha mikro kecil menengah, UMKM) based on their assets and revenues according to Law No. 20/2008:[16] Type Maximum assets, Rp Maximum revenue, Rp Micro 50,000,000 300,000,000 Small 500,000,000 2,500,000,000 Medium 10,000,000,000 50,000,000,000 An annual revenue of Rp 50 billion is approximately equal to US$3.7 million as of November 2017. Bangladesh[edit] In Bangladesh, Bangladesh Bank defines Small and medium enterprises based on Fixed Asset, Employed Manpower and Yearly turn over and they are definitely not Public Limited Co. and requires these characteristics - Serial No Sector Fixed Asset other than Land and Building (Tk) SE (Small Enterprises) & ME (Medium Enterprises) Employed Manpower Yearly Turn Over (Tk) (N/A-Not Applicable) 01 Services For SE 1000,000 - 200,00,000 & For ME 200,00,000 - 30,00,00,000 SE - 16-50 & ME - 51-120 N/A 02 Business For SE 1000,000 - 200,00,000 SE - 16-50 SE 10,000,000-120,000,000 03 Industrial For SE 7,500,000 - 150,000,000 For Me 150,000,000 - 500,000,000 SE - 31-120 & ME - 121-300 N/A Singapore[edit] With effect from 1 April 2011, the definition of SMEs is businesses with annual sales turnover of not more than $100 million or employing no more than 200 staff.[17] Europe[edit] European Union[edit] Small companies are important to the European economy as they account for 99.8% of non-financial enterprises in the European Union, and employ two-thirds of the workforce in the EU.[18][19] The criteria for defining the size of a business differ from country to country, with many countries having programs of business rate reduction and financial subsidy for SMEs. According to the European Commission,[20] SMEs are enterprises which meet the following definition of staff headcount and either the turnover or balance sheet total definitions: Company category Staff headcount Turnover Balance sheet total Medium-sized < 250 ≤ €50 million ≤ €43 million Small < 50 ≤ €10 million ≤ €10 million Micro < 10 ≤ €2 million ≤ €2 million In July 2011, the European Commission said it would open a consultation on the definition of SMEs in 2012. A consultation document was issued on 6 February 2018 and the consultation period closed on 6 May 2018. As of November 2019[update] no conclusions or responses have yet emerged.[21] In Europe, there are three broad parameters which define SMEs: Micro-enterprises have up to 10 employees Small enterprises have up to 50 employees Medium-sized enterprises have up to 250 employees.[22] The European definition of SME follows: ""The category of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is made up of enterprises which employ fewer than 250 persons and which have an annual turnover not exceeding 50 million euro, and/or an annual balance sheet total not exceeding 43 million euro.""[23] In order to prepare for an evaluation and revision of some features of the small and medium-sized enterprises definition European Union established public consultation period from 6 February 2018 to 6 May 2018. Public consultation is available for all EU member country citizens and organizations. Especially, national and regional authorities, enterprises, business associations or organizations, venture capital providers, research and academic institutions, and individual citizens are expected as the main contributors.[24] EU member states have had individual definitions of what constitutes an SME. For example, the definition in Germany had a limit of 255 employees, while in Belgium it could have been 100. The result is that while a Belgian business of 249 employees would be taxed at full rate in Belgium, it would nevertheless be eligible for SME subsidy under a European-labelled programme. SMEs are a crucial element in the supplier network of large enterprises which are already on their way towards Industry 4.0.[25] According to German economist Hans-Heinrich Bass, ""empirical research on SME as well as policies to promote SME have a long tradition in [West] Germany, dating back into the 19th century. Until the mid-20th century most researchers considered SME as an impediment to further economic development and SME policies were thus designed in the framework of social policies. Only the Ordoliberalism school, the founding fathers of Germany's social market economy, discovered their strengths, considered SME as a solution to mid-20th century economic problems (mass unemployment, abuse of economic power), and laid the foundations for non-selective (functional) industrial policies to promote SMEs.""[26] Only around 20% of European SMEs are substantially digitalized, compared to almost 50% of major businesses.[18][27] Small and medium-sized companies make up 56.2% of the non-financial sector. Smaller companies account for more than 60% of the value contributed to the non-financial sector in Belgium, Italy, and Spain, three of the nations worst hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.[18][28] An estimated 50% of Europe's small firms may fail because they lack the substantial financial reserves required to weather the crisis.[18][29] Poland[edit] The SME sector in Poland generates almost 50% of the GDP, and out of that, for instance, in 2011, micro companies generated 29.6%, small companies 7.7%, and medium companies 10.4% (big companies 24.0%; other entities 16.5%, and revenues from customs duties and taxes generated 11.9%). In 2011, out of the total of 1,784,603 entities operating in Poland, merely 3,189 were classified as ""large"", so 1,781,414 were micro, small, or medium. SMEs employed 6.3 million people out of the total of 9.0 million of labour employed in the private sector. In Poland in 2011 was 36.2 SMEs per 1,000 of inhabitants.[30] United Kingdom[edit] In the UK, a company is defined as being an SME if it meets two out of three criteria: it has a turnover of less than £25m, it has fewer than 250 employees, it has gross assets of less than £12.5m.[31] Very small companies are called in the UK micro-entities, which have simpler financial reporting requirements. Such micro-enterprises must meet any two of the following criteria: balance sheet £316,000 or less; turnover £632,000 or less; employees 10 or less.[32] Many small and medium-sized businesses form part of the UK's currently growing Mittelstand, or Brittelstand as it is also sometimes named.[33] These are businesses in Britain that are not only small or medium but also have a much broader set of values and more elastic definition. The Department for Business Innovation and Skills estimated that at the start of 2014, 99.3% of UK private sector businesses were SMEs, with their £1.6 trillion annual turnover accounting for 47% of private sector turnover.[34][35] In order to support SMEs, the UK government set a target in 2010 ""that 25% of government’s spend, either directly or in supply chains, goes to SMEs by 2015""; it achieved this by 2013.[36] Switzerland[edit] In Switzerland, the Federal Statistical Office defines small and medium-sized enterprises as companies with less than 250 employees.[37] The categories are the following:[37] Microentreprises: 1 to 9 employees. Small enterprises: 10 to 49 employees. Medium-sized enterprises: 50 to 249 employees. Large enterprises: 250 employees or more. North America[edit] Canada[edit] Industry Canada defines a small business as one with fewer than 100 paid employees and a medium-sized business as one with at least 100 and fewer than 500 employees. As of December 2012, there were 1,107,540 employer businesses in Canada, of rally. Canadian Controlled private corporations receive a 17% reduction in the tax rate on taxable income from active businesses up to $500,000. This small business deduction is reduced for corporations whose taxable capital exceeding $10M, and is completely eliminated for corporations whose taxable capital exceeds $15M.[38] It has been estimated that almost $2 trillion of Canadian SMEs will be coming up for sale over the next decade which is twice as large as the assets of the top 1,000 Canadian pension plans and approximately the same size as Canadian annual GDP.[39] Mexico[edit] The small and medium-sized companies in Mexico are called PYMEs, which is a direct translation of SMEs. But there's another categorization in the country called MiPyMEs. The MiPyMEs are micro, small and medium-sized businesses, with an emphasis on micro which are one man companies or a type of freelance. United States[edit] In the United States, the Small Business Administration sets small business criteria based on industry, ownership structure, revenue and number of employees (which in some circumstances may be as high as 1500, although the cap is typically 500).[40] Both the US and the EU generally use the same threshold of fewer than 10 employees for small offices (SOHO).[citation needed] Oceania[edit] Australia[edit] This section needs additional citations for verification.

(May 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In Australia, a SME has 200 or fewer employees. Micro Businesses have 1–4 employees, small businesses 5–19, medium businesses 20–199, and large businesses 200+.[41] Australian SMEs make up 98% of all Australian businesses, produced one third of total GDP, and employ 4.7 million people. SMEs represent 90 per cent of all goods exporters and over 60% of services exporters.[42] New Zealand[edit] In New Zealand, 99% of businesses employ 50 or less staff, and the official definition of a small business is one with 19 or fewer employees.[43][44] It is estimated that approximately 28% of New Zealand's gross domestic product is produced by companies with fewer than 20 employees.[45] See also[edit] Confédération Européenne des Associations de Petites et Moyennes Entreprises (CEA-PME), an international federation of SME associations Environmental regulation of small and medium enterprises Hidden champions Mittelstand Small and medium enterprises in Mexico Small business References[edit] ^ Compare: Fischer, Eileen; Reuber, Rebecca (2000).

Marseille (/mɑːrˈseɪ/ mar-SAY, also spelled in English as Marseilles; French: [maʁsɛj] (listen), locally [maχˈsɛjə] (listen); Occitan: Marselha [maʀˈsejɔ, -ˈsijɔ]) is the prefecture of the Bouches-du-Rhône department and Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region in France. Situated in the Provence historical province, it is located on the coast of the Gulf of Lion, part of the Mediterranean Sea, near the mouth of the Rhône. Marseille is the second-largest city in France, covering an area of 241 km2 (93 sq mi); it had a population of 870,018 in 2016.[4] Its metropolitan area, which extends over 3,174 km2 (1,225 sq mi), is the third-largest in France after those of Paris and Lyon, with a population of 1,760,653 as of 2017,[3] or 3,100,329 (2019) by the broader Eurostat definition of metropolitan region.[5] Its inhabitants are called Marseillais. Founded around 599 BC by Greek settlers from Phocaea, Marseille is the oldest city of France, as well as one of Europe's oldest continuously inhabited settlements.[6][7] It was known to the ancient Greeks as Massalia (Greek: Μασσαλία, romanized: Massalía) and to Romans as Massilia.[6][8] Marseille has been a trading port since ancient times. In particular, it experienced a considerable commercial boom during the colonial period and especially during the 19th century, becoming a prosperous industrial and trading city. Nowadays the Old Port still lies at the heart of the city where the manufacturing of soap, its famous savon de Marseille, began some 6 centuries ago. Overlooking the port is the Basilica of Notre-Dame-de-la-Garde or ""Bonne-mère"" for the people of Marseille, a Romano-Byzantine church and the symbol of the city. Inherited from this past, the Grand Port Maritime de Marseille (GPMM) and the maritime economy are major poles of regional and national activity and Marseille remains the first French port, the second Mediterranean port and the fifth European port.[9] Since its origins, Marseille's openness to the Mediterranean Sea has made it a cosmopolitan city marked by cultural and economic exchanges with Southern Europe, the Middle East, North Africa and Asia. In Europe, the city has the third largest Jewish community after London and Paris.[10] In the 1990s, the Euroméditerranée project for economic development and urban renewal was launched. New infrastructures and renovations were carried out in the 2000s and 2010s: the tramway, the renovation of the Hôtel-Dieu into a luxury hotel, the expansion of the Velodrome Stadium, the CMA CGM Tower, as well as other quayside museums such as the Museum of Civilisations of Europe and the Mediterranean (MuCEM). As a result, Marseille now has the most museums in France after Paris. The city was named European Capital of Culture in 2013 and European Capital of Sport in 2017. Additionally, Marseille hosted matches at the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2016. It is also home to several higher education institutions in the region, including the University of Aix-Marseille.

To the east, starting in the small fishing village of Callelongue on the outskirts of Marseille and stretching as far as Cassis, are the Calanques, a rugged coastal area interspersed with small fjord-like inlets. Farther east still are the Sainte-Baume (a 1,147 m (3,763 ft) mountain ridge rising from a forest of deciduous trees), the city of Toulon and the French Riviera. To the north of Marseille, beyond the low Garlaban and Etoile mountain ranges, is the 1,011 m (3,317 ft) Mont Sainte Victoire. To the west of Marseille is the former artists' colony of l'Estaque; farther west are the Côte Bleue, the Gulf of Lion and the Camargue region in the Rhône delta. The airport lies to the north west of the city at Marignane on the Étang de Berre.[11] The city's main thoroughfare (the wide boulevard called the Canebière) stretches eastward from the Old Port to the Réformés quarter. Two large forts flank the entrance to the Old Port—Fort Saint-Nicolas[a][12] on the south side and Fort Saint-Jean on the north. Farther out in the Bay of Marseille is the Frioul archipelago which comprises four islands, one of which, If, is the location of Château d'If, made famous by the Dumas novel The Count of Monte Cristo. The main commercial centre of the city intersects with the Canebière at Rue St Ferréol and the Centre Bourse (one of the city's main shopping malls). The centre of Marseille has several pedestrianised zones, most notably Rue St Ferréol, Cours Julien near the Music Conservatory, the Cours Honoré-d'Estienne-d'Orves off the Old Port and the area around the Hôtel de Ville. To the south east of central Marseille in the 6th arrondissement are the Prefecture and the monumental fountain of Place Castellane, an important bus and metro interchange. To the south west are the hills of the 7th and 8th arrondissements, dominated by the basilica of Notre-Dame de la Garde. Marseille's main railway station—Gare de Marseille Saint-Charles—is north of the Centre Bourse in the 1st arrondissement; it is linked by the Boulevard d'Athènes to the Canebière.[11] History[edit] Main articles: History of Marseille and Timeline of Marseille Marseille and Calanques National Park from the ISS, February 2017 Notre-Dame de la Garde from above, July 2020 A silver drachma inscribed with MASSA[LIA] (ΜΑΣΣΑ[ΛΙΑ]), dated 375–200 BC, during the Hellenistic period of Marseille, bearing the head of the Greek goddess Artemis on the obverse and a lion on the reverse Marseille was founded as the Greek colony of Massalia circa 600 BC, and was populated by Greek settlers from Phocaea (modern Foça, Turkey). It became the preeminent Greek polis in the Hellenized region of southern Gaul.[13] The city-state sided with the Roman Republic against Carthage during the Second Punic War (218–201 BC), retaining its independence and commercial empire throughout the western Mediterranean even as Rome expanded into Western Europe and North Africa. However, the city lost its independence following the Roman Siege of Massilia in 49 BC, during Caesar's Civil War, in which Massalia sided with the exiled faction at war with Julius Caesar. Afterward the Gallo-Roman culture was initiated. Marseille continued to prosper as a Gallo-Roman city, becoming an early center of Christianity during the Western Roman Empire.[citation needed] The city maintained its position as a premier maritime trading hub even after its capture by the Visigoths in the 5th century AD, although the city went into decline following the sack of 739 AD by the forces of Charles Martel. It became part of the County of Provence during the 10th century, although its renewed prosperity was curtailed by the Black Death of the 14th century and a sack of the city by the Crown of Aragon in 1423. The city's fortunes rebounded with the ambitious building projects of René of Anjou, Count of Provence, who strengthened the city's fortifications during the mid-15th century. During the 16th century the city hosted a naval fleet with the combined forces of the Franco-Ottoman alliance, which threatened the ports and navies of the Genoese Republic.[14] Marseille lost a significant portion of its population during the Great Plague of Marseille in 1720, but the population had recovered by mid-century. In 1792, the city became a focal point of the French Revolution and though France's national anthem was born in Strasbourg, it was first sung in Paris by volunteers from Marseille, hence the name the crowd gave it: La Marseillaise. The Industrial Revolution and establishment of the French Empire during the 19th century allowed for further expansion of the city, although it was occupied by the German Wehrmacht in November 1942 and subsequently heavily damaged during World War II. The city has since become a major center for immigrant communities from former French colonies, such as French Algeria. Economy[edit] Marseille is a major French centre for trade and industry, with excellent transportation infrastructure (roads, sea port and airport). Marseille Provence Airport is the fourth largest in France. In May 2005, the French financial magazine L'Expansion named Marseille the most dynamic of France's large cities, citing figures showing that 7,200 companies had been created in the city since 2000.[15] Marseille is also France's second largest research centre with 3,000 research scientists within Aix Marseille University.[citation needed] As of 2014[update], the Marseille metropolitan area had a GDP amounting to $60.3 billion, or $36,127 per capita (purchasing power parity).[16] Port[edit] Main articles: Marseille-Fos Port, Old Port of Marseille, and Docks (Marseille) The entrance to the Old Port, flanked by Fort Saint-Jean and Fort Saint-Nicolas Historically, the economy of Marseille was dominated by its role as a port of the French Empire, linking the North African colonies of Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia with Metropolitan France. The Old Port was replaced as the main port for trade by the Port de la Joliette (now part of Marseille-Fos Port) during the Second Empire and now contains restaurants, offices, bars and hotels and functions mostly as a private marina. The majority of the port and docks, which experienced decline in the 1970s after the oil crisis, have been recently redeveloped with funds from the European Union. Fishing remains important in Marseille and the food economy of Marseille is fed by the local catch; a daily fish market is still held on the Quai des Belges of the Old Port. The economy of Marseille and its region is still linked to its commercial port, the first French port and the fifth European port by cargo tonnage, which lies north of the Old Port and eastern in Fos-sur-Mer. Some 45,000 jobs are linked to the port activities and it represents 4 billion euros added value to the regional economy.[17] 100 million tons of freight pass annually through the port, 60% of which is petroleum, making it number one in France and the Mediterranean and number three in Europe. However, in the early 2000s, the growth in container traffic was being stifled by the constant strikes and social upheaval.[18] The port is among the 20th firsts in Europe for container traffic with 1,062,408 TEU and new infrastructures have already raised the capacity to 2M TEU.[19] Petroleum refining and shipbuilding are the principal industries, but chemicals, soap, glass, sugar, building materials, plastics, textiles, olive oil, and processed foods are also important products.[citation needed] Marseille is connected with the Rhône via a canal and thus has access to the extensive waterway network of France. Petroleum is shipped northward to the Paris basin by pipeline. The city also serves as France's leading centre of oil refining. Companies, services and high technologies[edit] From left to right: La Joliette neighbourhood (old docks), ferry ship docks, new port, Euroméditerranée business district (CMA CGM Tower) and surrounding areas In recent years, the city has also experienced a large growth in service sector employment and a switch from light manufacturing to a cultural, high-tech economy.[citation needed] The Marseille region is home to thousands of companies, 90% of which are small and medium enterprises with less than 500 employees.[20][full citation needed] Among the most famous ones are CMA CGM, container-shipping giant; Compagnie maritime d'expertises (Comex), world leader in sub-sea engineering and hydraulic systems; Airbus Helicopters, an Airbus division; Azur Promotel, an active real estate development company; La Provence, the local daily newspaper; RTM, Marseille's public transport company; and Société Nationale Maritime Corse Méditerranée (SNCM), a major operator in passenger, vehicle and freight transportation in the Western Mediterranean. The urban operation Euroméditerranée has developed a large offer of offices and thus Marseille hosts one of the main business district in France. Marseille is the home of three main technopoles: Château-Gombert (technological innovations), Luminy (biotechnology) and La Belle de Mai (17,000 sq.m. of offices dedicated to multimedia activities).[21][22] Tourism and attractions[edit] Pointe Rouge Beach Palais du Pharo The port is also an important arrival base for millions of people each year, with 2.4 million including 890,100 from cruise ships.[17] With its beaches, history, architecture and culture (24 museums and 42 theatres), Marseille is one of the most visited cities in France, with 4.1 million visitors in 2012.[23] Marseille is ranked 86th in the world for business tourism and events, advancing from the 150th spot one year before.[citation needed] The number of congress days hosted on its territory increased from 109,000 in 1996 to almost 300,000 in 2011.[citation needed] They take place in three main sites, the Palais du Pharo, Palais des Congrès et des Expositions (Parc Chanot) and World Trade Center.[24] In 2012 Marseille hosted the World Water Forum. Several urban projects have been developed to make Marseille attractive. Thus new parks, museums, public spaces and real estate projects aim to improve the city's quality of life (Parc du 26e Centenaire, Old Port of Marseille,[25] numerous places in Euroméditerranée) to attract firms and people. Marseille municipality acts to develop Marseille as a regional nexus for entertainment in the south of France with high concentration of museums, cinemas, theatres, clubs, bars, restaurants, fashion shops, hotels, and art galleries. Employment[edit] Unemployment in the economy fell from 20% in 1995 to 14% in 2004.[26] However, Marseille unemployment rate remains higher than the national average. In some parts of Marseille, youth unemployment is reported to be as high as 40%.[27] Administration[edit] Main articles: Arrondissements of Marseille and Cantons of Marseille The sectors and arrondissements of Marseille Political majority in each sector since 2014 The city of Marseille is divided into 16 municipal arrondissements, which are themselves informally divided into 111 neighbourhoods (French: quartiers). The arrondissements are regrouped in pairs, into 8 sectors, each with a mayor and council (like the arrondissements in Paris and Lyon).[28] Municipal elections are held every six years and are carried out by sector. There are 303 councilmembers in total, two-thirds sitting in the sector councils and one third in the city council. The 9th arrondissement of Marseille is the largest in terms of area because it comprises parts of Calanques National Park. With a population of 89,316 (2007), the 13th arrondissement of Marseille is the most populous one. From 1950 to the mid-1990s, Marseille was a Socialist (PS) and Communist (PCF) stronghold. Gaston Defferre (PS) was consecutively reelected six times as Mayor of Marseille from 1953 until his death in 1986. He was succeeded by Robert Vigouroux of the European Democratic and Social Rally (RDSE). Jean-Claude Gaudin of the conservative UMP was elected Mayor of Marseille in 1995. Gaudin was reelected in 2001, 2008 and 2014. In recent years, the Communist Party has lost most of its strength in the northern boroughs of the city, whereas the National Front has received significant support. At the last municipal election in 2014, Marseille was divided between the northern arrondissements dominated by the left (PS) and far-right (FN) and the southern part of town dominated by the conservative (UMP). Marseille is also divided in twelve cantons, each of them sending two members to the Departmental Council of the Bouches-du-Rhône department. Mayors of Marseille since the beginning of the 20th century[edit] Gaston Defferre served as Mayor of Marseille from 1953 to 1986. Jean-Claude Gaudin served as Mayor of Marseille from 1995 to 2020.

Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (June 2017) Because of its pre-eminence as a Mediterranean port, Marseille has always been one of the main gateways into France. This has attracted many immigrants and made Marseille a cosmopolitan melting pot. By the end of the 18th century about half the population originated from elsewhere in Provence mostly and also from southern France.[31][32][page needed] Economic conditions and political unrest in Europe and the rest of the world brought several other waves of immigrants during the 20th century: Greeks and Italians started arriving at the end of the 19th century and in the first half of the 20th century, up to 40% of the city's population was of Italian origin;[33] Russians in 1917; Armenians in 1915 and 1923; Vietnamese in the 1920s, 1954 and after 1975;[34] Corsicans during the 1920s and 1930s; Spanish after 1936; Maghrebis (both Arab and Berber) in the inter-war period; Sub-Saharan Africans after 1945; Maghrebi Jews in the 1950s and 1960s; the Pieds-Noirs from the former French Algeria in 1962; and then from Comoros. In 2006, it was reported that 70,000 city residents were considered to be of Maghrebi origin, mostly from Algeria. The second largest group in Marseille in terms of single nationalities were from the Comoros, amounting to some 45,000 people.[33] Currently, over one third of the population of Marseille can trace their roots back to Italy.[35] Marseille also has the second-largest Corsican and Armenian populations of France. Other significant communities include Maghrebis, Turks, Comorians, Chinese, and Vietnamese.[36] In 1999, in several arrondissements, about 40% of the young people under 18 were of Maghrebi origin (at least one immigrant parent).[37] Since 2013 a significant number of Central- and Eastern European immigrants have settled in Marseille, attracted by better job opportunities and the good climate of this Mediterranean city. The main nationalities of the immigrants are Romanians and Poles.[38] Largest groups of foreign residents Nationality Population (2014)[39] Algeria 41,987 Tunisia 10,918 Morocco 8,411 Comoros 7,889 Italy 4,927 Turkey 4,497 Spain 2,717 Portugal 2,382 Romania 2,308 Senegal 2,150 Madagascar 1,869 Vietnam 1,606 Russia 1,359 China[b] 1,200 Lebanon 1,155 Place of birth of residents of the city proper of Marseille in 1999 Born in Metropolitan France Born outside Metropolitan France 78.9% 21.1% Born inOverseas France Born in foreign countries with French citizenship at birth1 EU-15 immigrants2 Non-EU-15 immigrants 0.9% 8.8% 2.1% 9.3% Place of birth of residents of the metropolitan area of Marseille in 1999 Born in metropolitan France Born outside metropolitan France 81.2% 18.8% Born inoverseas France Born in foreign countries with French citizenship at birth1 EU-15 immigrants2 Non-EU-15 immigrants 0.7% N/A% N/A% N/A% 1 This group is made up largely of former French settlers, such as Pieds-Noirs in Northwest Africa, followed by former colonial citizens who had French citizenship at birth (such as was often the case for the native elite in French colonies), as well as to a lesser extent foreign-born children of French expatriates. Note that a foreign country is understood as a country not part of France in 1999, so a person born for example in 1950 in Algeria, when Algeria was an integral part of France, is nonetheless listed as a person born in a foreign country in French statistics. 2 An immigrant is a person born in a foreign country not having French citizenship at birth. Note that an immigrant may have acquired French citizenship since moving to France, but is still considered an immigrant in French statistics. On the other hand, persons born in France with foreign citizenship (the children of immigrants) are not listed as immigrants. Religion[edit] According to data from 2010, major religious communities in Marseille include: Roman Catholic (415,000 or 38.5%)[40] Muslim (264,000 or 25%) Non-religious (156.000 or 14.5%) Armenian Apostolic (80,000 or 7.5%) Protestant (mostly Pentecostal) (75,000 or 7.1%) Jewish (52,000 or 4.9%) Eastern Orthodox (15,000 or 1.4%) Hindu (4,000 or 0.4%) Buddhist (3,000 or 0.3%).[41] Culture[edit] Paul Cézanne's The Bay of Marseille, Seen from L'Estaque Bastille Day military parade in Marseille, 2012 Marseille is a city that has its own unique culture and is proud of its differences from the rest of France.[42] Today it is a regional centre for culture and entertainment with an important opera house, historical and maritime museums, five art galleries and numerous cinemas, clubs, bars and restaurants. Marseille has a large number of theatres, including La Criée, Le Gymnase and the Théâtre Toursky. There is also an extensive arts centre in La Friche, a former match factory behind the Saint-Charles station. The Alcazar, until the 1960s a well known music hall and variety theatre, has recently been completely remodelled behind its original façade and now houses the central municipal library.[43] Other music venues in Marseille include Le Silo (also a theatre) and GRIM. Marseille has also been important in the arts. It has been the birthplace and home of many French writers and poets, including Victor Gélu [fr], Valère Bernard, Pierre Bertas,[44] Edmond Rostand and André Roussin. The small port of l'Estaque on the far end of the Bay of Marseille became a favourite haunt for artists, including Auguste Renoir, Paul Cézanne (who frequently visited from his home in Aix), Georges Braque and Raoul Dufy. Multi-cultural influences[edit] Rich and poor neighborhoods exist side by side. Although the city is not without crime, Marseille has a larger degree of multicultural tolerance. Urban geographers[45] say the city's geography, being surrounded by mountains, helps explain why Marseille does not have the same problems as Paris. In Paris, ethnic areas are segregated and concentrated in the periphery of the city. Residents of Marseille are of diverse origins, yet appear to share a similar particular identity.[46][47] An example is how Marseille responded in 2005, when ethnic populations living in other French cities' suburbs rioted, but Marseille remained relatively calm.[48] Marseille served as the European Capital of Culture for 2013 along with Košice.[49] It was chosen to give a 'human face' to the European Union to celebrate cultural diversity and to increase understanding between Europeans.[50] One of the intentions of highlighting culture is to help reposition Marseille internationally, stimulate the economy, and help to build better interconnection between groups.[51] Marseille-Provence 2013 (MP2013) featured more than 900 cultural events held throughout Marseille and the surrounding communities. These cultural events generated more than 11 million visits.[52] The European Capital of Culture was also the occasion to unveil more than 600 million euros in new cultural infrastructure in Marseille and its environs, including the MuCEM designed by Rudy Ricciotti. Early on, immigrants came to Marseille locally from the surrounding Provence region. By the 1890s immigrants came from other regions of France as well as Italy.[53] Marseille became one of Europe's busiest port by 1900.[47] Marseille has served as a major port where immigrants from around the Mediterranean arrive.[53] Marseille continued to be multicultural. Armenians from the Ottoman Empire began arriving in 1913. In the 1930s, Italians settled in Marseille. After World War II, a wave of Jewish immigrants from North Africa arrived. In 1962, a number of French colonies gained their independence, and the French citizens from Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia arrived in Marseille.[54] The city had an economic downturn and lost many jobs. Those who could afford to move left and the poorest remained. For a while, the mafia appeared to run the city, and for a period of time the communist party was prominent.[54] Multi-cultural Marseille can be observed by a visitor at the market at Noailles, also called Marché des Capucins, in old town near the Old Port. There, Lebanese bakeries, an African spice market, Chinese and Vietnamese groceries, fresh vegetables and fruit, shops selling couscous, shops selling Caribbean food are side by side with stalls selling shoes and clothing from around the Mediterranean. Nearby, people sell fresh fish and men from Tunisia drink tea.[54] Although most Armenians arrived after the Armenian Genocide, Armenians had a long presence even before the 20th and late 19th centuries. Armenians, having an extensive trade network worldwide, massively traded with Marseille and its port. Most notably, during the 16th century, and after the Armenians gained a monopoly over Iranian silk, which was granted to them by Shah Abbas of Iran, the trade flow of Armenians of Marseille increased tremendously.[55] Merchants of Armenian origin received trade privileges in France by Armand Jean du Plessis de Richelieu (1585–1642) and later on Jean-Baptiste Colbert (1619–1683) Marseille a free port in 1669. One notable Armenian-Iranian merchant gained a patent from Louis XIV (1638–1715) over Iranian silk.[56] Armenians also became successful money-lenders and bankers in the city. Due to these policies and the multiculturalism of the city of Marseille, Armenians became very wealthy, and the legacy of the Armenians in the city still lives on. Tarot de Marseille[edit] Marseille tarot card The most commonly used tarot deck takes its name from the city; it has been called the Tarot de Marseille since the 1930s—a name coined for commercial use by the French cardmaker and cartomancer Paul Marteau, owner of B–P Grimaud. Previously this deck was called Tarot italien (Italian Tarot) and even earlier it was simply called Tarot. Before being de Marseille, it was used to play the local variant of tarocchi before it became used in cartomancy at the end of the 18th century, following the trend set by Antoine Court de Gébelin. The name Tarot de Marseille (Marteau used the name ancien Tarot de Marseille) was used by contrast to other types of Tarots such as Tarot de Besançon; those names were simply associated with cities where there were many cardmakers in the 18th century (previously several cities in France were involved in cardmaking).[57] Another local tradition is the making of santons, small hand-crafted figurines for the traditional Provençal Christmas creche. Since 1803, starting on the last Sunday of November, there has been a Santon Fair in Marseille; it is currently held in the Cours d'Estienne d'Orves, a large square off the Vieux-Port. Opera[edit] The Opéra de Marseille Marseille's main cultural attraction was, since its creation at the end of the 18th century and until the late 1970s, the Opéra. Located near the Old Port and the Canebière, at the very heart of the city, its architectural style was comparable to the classical trend found in other opera houses built at the same time in Lyon and Bordeaux. In 1919, a fire almost completely destroyed the house, leaving only the stone colonnade and peristyle from the original façade.[58][59] The classical façade was restored and the opera house reconstructed in a predominantly Art Deco style, as the result of a major competition. Currently the Opéra de Marseille stages six or seven operas each year.[60] Since 1972, the Ballet national de Marseille has performed at the opera house; its director from its foundation to 1998 was Roland Petit. Popular events and festivals[edit] There are several popular festivals in different neighborhoods, with concerts, animations, and outdoor bars, like the Fête du Panier in June. On 21 June, there are dozens of free concerts in the city as part of France's Fête de la Musique, featuring music from all over the world. Being free events, many Marseille residents attend. Marseille hosts a Gay Pride event in early July. In 2013, Marseille hosted Europride, an international LGBT event, 10 July–20.[61] At the beginning of July, there is the International Documentary Festival.[62] At the end of September, the electronic music festival Marsatac takes place. In October, the Fiesta des Suds offers many concerts of world music.[63] Hip hop music[edit] Marseille is also well known in France for its hip hop music.[64] Bands like IAM originated from Marseille. Other known groups include Fonky Family, Psy 4 de la Rime (including rappers Soprano and Alonzo), and Keny Arkana. In a slightly different way, ragga music is represented by Massilia Sound System. Food[edit] Traditional Marseille bouillabaisse Swordfish in olive oil with ratatouille and saffron rice Pieds paquets Bouillabaisse is the most famous seafood dish of Marseille. It is a fish stew containing at least three varieties of very fresh local fish: typically red rascasse (Scorpaena scrofa); sea robin (fr: grondin); and European conger (fr: congre).[65] It can include gilt-head bream (fr: dorade); turbot; monkfish (fr: lotte or baudroie); mullet; or silver hake (fr: merlan), and it usually includes shellfish and other seafood such as sea urchins (fr: oursins), mussels (fr: moules); velvet crabs (fr: étrilles); spider crab (fr: araignées de mer), plus potatoes and vegetables. In the traditional version, the fish is served on a platter separate from the broth.[66] The broth is served with rouille, a mayonnaise made with egg yolk, olive oil, red bell pepper, saffron, and garlic, spread on pieces of toasted bread, or croûtons.[67][68] In Marseille, bouillabaisse is rarely made for fewer than ten people; the more people who share the meal, and the more different fish that are included, the better the bouillabaisse.[69] Aïoli is a sauce made from raw garlic, lemon juice, eggs and olive oil, served with boiled fish, hard boiled eggs and cooked vegetables.[67] Anchoïade [fr] is a paste made from anchovies, garlic, and olive oil, spread on bread or served with raw vegetables.[67] Bourride is a soup made with white fish (monkfish, European sea bass, whiting, etc.) and aïoli.[70] Fougasse is a flat Provençal bread, similar to the Italian focaccia. It is traditionally baked in a wood oven and sometimes filled with olives, cheese or anchovies.[citation needed] Navette de Marseille [fr] are, in the words of food writer M. F. K. Fisher, ""little boat-shaped cookies, tough dough tasting vaguely of orange peel, smelling better than they are.""[71] Farinata#French variations is chickpea flour boiled into a thick mush, allowed to firm up, then cut into blocks and fried.[72] Pastis is an alcoholic beverage made with aniseed and spice. It is extremely popular in the region.[73] Pieds paquets is a dish prepared from sheep's feet and offal.[70] Pistou is a combination of crushed fresh basil and garlic with olive oil, similar to the Italian pesto. The ""soupe au pistou"" combines pistou in a broth with pasta and vegetables.[67] Tapenade is a paste made from chopped olives, capers, and olive oil (sometimes anchovies may be added).[74] Films set in Marseille[edit] Main article: List of films set in Marseille Marseille has been the setting for many films.

Marseille is also home to the headquarters of the IRD, which promotes research into questions affecting developing countries.[citation needed] Transport[edit] Motorways around Marseille International and regional transport[edit] Marseille Provence Airport, the fifth busiest in France. The city is served by an international airport, Marseille Provence Airport, located in Marignane. The airport is the fifth busiest French airport, and known the 4th most important European traffic growth in 2012.[93] An extensive network of motorways connects Marseille to the north and west (A7), Aix-en-Provence in the north (A51), Toulon (A50) and the French Riviera (A8) to the east. Gare de Marseille Saint-Charles is Marseille's main railway station. It operates direct regional services to Aix-en-Provence, Briançon, Toulon, Avignon, Nice, Montpellier, Toulouse, Bordeaux, Nantes, etc. Gare Saint-Charles is also one of the main terminal stations for the TGV in the south of France making Marseille reachable in three hours from Paris (a distance of over 750 km) and just over one and a half hours from Lyon. There are also direct TGV lines to Lille, Brussels, Nantes, Geneva, Strasbourg and Frankfurt as well as Eurostar services to London (just in the summer) and Thello services to Milan (just one a day), via Nice and Genoa. There is a new long-distance bus station adjacent to new modern extension to the Gare Saint-Charles with destinations mostly to other Bouches-du-Rhône towns, including buses to Aix-en-Provence, Cassis, La Ciotat and Aubagne. The city is also served with 11 other regional trains stations in the east and the north of the city. Marseille has a large ferry terminal, the Gare Maritime, with services to Corsica, Sardinia, Algeria and Tunisia. Public transport[edit] See also: Transportation in Marseille Metro and tramway network Marseille is connected by the Marseille Métro train system operated by the Régie des transports de Marseille (RTM). It consists of two lines: Line 1 (blue) between Castellane and La Rose opened in 1977 and Line 2 (red) between Sainte-Marguerite-Dromel and Bougainville opened between 1984 and 1987. An extension of the Line 1 from Castellane to La Timone was completed in 1992, another extension from La Timone to La Fourragère (2.5 km (1.6 mi) and 4 new stations) was opened in May 2010. The Métro system operates on a turnstile system, with tickets purchased at the nearby adjacent automated booths. Both lines of the Métro intersect at Gare Saint-Charles and Castellane. Three bus rapid transit lines are under construction to better connect the Métro to farther places (Castellane -> Luminy; Capitaine Gèze – La Cabucelle -> Vallon des Tuves; La Rose -> Château Gombert – Saint Jérome). The new tramway An extensive bus network serves the city and suburbs of Marseille, with 104 lines and 633 buses. The three lines of the tramway,[94] opened in 2007, go from the CMA CGM Tower towards Les Caillols. As in many other French cities, a bike-sharing service nicknamed ""Le vélo"", free for trips of less than half an hour, was introduced by the city council in 2007.[95] A free ferry service operates between the two opposite quays of the Old Port. From 2011 ferry shuttle services operate between the Old Port and Pointe Rouge; in spring 2013 it will also run to l'Estaque.[96] There are also ferry services and boat trips available from the Old Port to Frioul, the Calanques and Cassis. Sport[edit] The Stade Vélodrome, home of Olympique de Marseille The city boasts a wide variety of sports facilities and teams.

The club's home, the Stade Vélodrome, which can seat around 67,000 people, also functions for other local sports, as well as the national rugby team. Stade Velodrome hosted a number of games during the 1998 FIFA World Cup, 2007 Rugby World Cup, and UEFA Euro 2016. The local rugby teams are Marseille XIII and Marseille Vitrolles Rugby.[citation needed] Marseille is famous for its important pétanque activity, it is even renowned as the pétanque capitale.[97] In 2012 Marseille hosted the Pétanque World Championship and the city hosts every year the Mondial la Marseillaise de pétanque, the main pétanque competition. Match Race France 2008 Sailing is a major sport in Marseille. The wind conditions allow regattas in the warm waters of the Mediterranean.[citation needed] Throughout most seasons of the year it can be windy while the sea remains smooth enough to allow sailing. Marseille has been the host of 8 (2010) Match Race France events which are part of the World Match Racing Tour. The event draws the world's best sailing teams to Marseille. The identical supplied boats (J Boats J-80 racing yachts) are raced two at a time in an on the water dogfight which tests the sailors and skippers to the limits of their physical abilities. Points accrued count towards the World Match Racing Tour and a place in the final event, with the overall winner taking the title ISAF World Match Racing Tour Champion. Match racing is an ideal sport for spectators in Marseille, as racing in close proximity to the shore provides excellent views. The city was also considered as a possible venue for 2007 America's Cup.[98] Marseille is also a place for other water sports such as windsurfing and powerboating. Marseille has three golf courses. The city has dozens of gyms and several public swimming pools. Running is also popular in many of Marseille's parks such as Le Pharo and Le Jardin Pierre Puget. An annual footrace is held between the city and neighbouring Cassis: the Marseille-Cassis Classique Internationale.[citation needed] Climate[edit] The city has a hot-summer mediterranean climate (Köppen: Csa) with cool-mild winters with moderate rainfall, because of the wet westerly winds, and hot, mostly dry summers, due to the dry winds blowing from the Sahara desert at that period.[99] December, January, and February are the coldest months, averaging temperatures of around 12 °C (54 °F) during the day and 4 °C (39 °F) at night. July and August are the hottest months, averaging temperatures of around 28–30 °C (82–86 °F) during the day and 19 °C (66 °F) at night in the Marignane airport (35 km (22 mi) from Marseille) but in the city near the sea the average high temperature is 27 °C (81 °F) in July.[100] Marseille is officially the sunniest major city in France with over 2,800 hours of sunshine while the average sunshine in the country is around 1,950 hours. It is also the driest major city with only 512 mm (20 in) of precipitation annually, mainly due to the Mistral, a cold, dry wind originating in the Rhône Valley that occurs mostly in winter and spring and which generally brings clear skies and sunny weather to the region. Less frequent is the Sirocco, a hot, sand-bearing wind, coming from the Sahara Desert. Snowfalls are infrequent; over 50% of years do not experience a single snowfall.[citation needed] The hottest temperature was 40.6 °C (105.1 °F) on 26 July 1983 during a great heat wave, the lowest temperature was −16.8 °C (1.8 °F) on 13 February 1929 during a strong cold wave.[101] Climate data for Marseille-Marignane (Marseille Provence Airport), elevation: 36 m, 1981–2010 normals, extremes

Adding these give the total shown here for the entire French Republic. The CIA reports the total as 643,801 km2 (248,573 sq mi). Official logo of the French Republic France (French: [fʁɑ̃s] ), officially the French Republic (French: République française),[1] is a transcontinental country spanning Western Europe and several overseas regions and territories.[XIII] Its metropolitan area extends from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean and from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea; overseas territories include French Guiana in South America and several islands in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. France borders Belgium, Luxembourg, and Germany to the northeast, Switzerland, Monaco and Italy to the east, Andorra and Spain to the south, as well as the Netherlands, Suriname, and Brazil in the Americas. Its eighteen integral regions (five of which are overseas) span a combined area of 643,801 km2 (248,573 sq mi) and over 67 million people (as of May 2021[update]).[12] France is a unitary semi-presidential republic with its capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre; other major urban areas include Lyon, Marseille, Toulouse, Bordeaux, Lille, and Nice. Including its overseas territories, France has twelve time zones, the most of any country. Inhabited since the Palaeolithic era, France was settled by Celtic tribes known as Gauls during the Iron Age. Rome annexed the area in 51 BC, leading to a distinct Gallo-Roman culture that laid the foundation of the French language. The Germanic Franks arrived in 476 and formed the Kingdom of Francia, which became the heartland of the Carolingian Empire. The Treaty of Verdun of 843 partitioned the empire, with West Francia becoming the Kingdom of France in 987. In the High Middle Ages, France was a powerful but highly decentralized feudal kingdom in which the king's authority was barely felt. King Philip Augustus achieved remarkable success in the strengthening of royal power and the expansion of his realm, defeating his rivals and doubling its size. By the end of his reign, the kingdom had emerged as the most powerful state in Europe. From the mid-14th to the mid-15th century, France was plunged into a series of dynastic conflicts for the French throne, collectively known as the Hundred Years' War, and a distinct French identity emerged as a result. The French Renaissance saw art and culture flourish, various wars with rival powers, and the establishment of a global colonial empire, which by the 20th century would become the second largest in the world.[13] The second half of the 16th century was dominated by religious civil wars between Catholics and Huguenots that severely weakened the country. But France once again emerged as Europe's dominant cultural, political, and military power in the 17th century under Louis XIV following the Thirty Years' War.[14] An inadequate taxation system, coupled with defeat in the Seven Years' War and costly involvement in the American War of Independence, left the kingdom in a precarious economic situation by the end of the 18th century. This precipitated the French Revolution of 1789, which overthrew the absolute monarchy, replaced the Ancien Régime with one of history's first modern republics, and produced the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, which expresses the nation's ideals to this day. France reached its political and military zenith in the early 19th century under Napoleon Bonaparte, subjugating much of continental Europe and establishing the First French Empire. The French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars shaped the course of European and world history. The collapse of the empire initiated a period of relative decline, in which France endured a tumultuous succession of governments until the founding of the French Third Republic during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. Subsequent decades saw a period of optimism, cultural and scientific flourishing, and economic prosperity known as the Belle Époque. France was one of the major participants of World War I, from which it emerged victorious at great human and economic cost. It was among the Allied powers of the World War II, but was soon occupied by the Axis in 1940. Following liberation in 1944, the short-lived Fourth Republic was established and later dissolved in the course of the Algerian War. The current Fifth Republic was formed in 1958 by Charles de Gaulle. Algeria and most French colonies became independent in the 1960s, with the majority retaining close economic and military ties with France. France retains its centuries-long status as a global centre of art, science, and philosophy. It hosts the fifth-largest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites and is the world's leading tourist destination, receiving over 89 million foreign visitors in 2018.[15] France is a developed country with the world's seventh-largest economy by nominal GDP and ninth-largest by PPP; in terms of aggregate household wealth, it ranks fourth in the world.[16] France performs well in international rankings of education, health care, life expectancy, and human development.[17][18] It remains a great power in global affairs,[19] being one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and an official nuclear-weapon state. France is a founding and leading member of the European Union and the Eurozone,[20] as well as a key member of the Group of Seven, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and La Francophonie.

The name of the Franks is related to the English word frank (""free""): the latter stems from the Old French franc (""free, noble, sincere""), ultimately from Medieval Latin francus (""free, exempt from service; freeman, Frank""), a generalization of the tribal name that emerged as a Late Latin borrowing of the reconstructed Frankish endonym *Frank.[22][23] It has been suggested that the meaning ""free"" was adopted because, after the conquest of Gaul, only Franks were free of taxation,[24] or more generally because they had the status of freemen in contrast to servants or slaves.[23] The etymology of *Frank is uncertain. It is traditionally derived from the Proto-Germanic word *frankōn, which translates as ""javelin"" or ""lance"" (the throwing axe of the Franks was known as the francisca),[25] although these weapons may have been named because of their use by the Franks, not the other way around.[23] In English, 'France' is pronounced /fræns/ FRANSS in American English and /frɑːns/ FRAHNSS or /fræns/ FRANSS in British English. The pronunciation with /ɑː/ is mostly confined to accents with the trap-bath split such as Received Pronunciation, though it can be also heard in some other dialects such as Cardiff English, in which /frɑːns/ is in free variation with /fræns/.[26][27] History Main article: History of France Prehistory (before the 6th century BC) Main article: Prehistory of France One of the Lascaux paintings: a horse – approximately 17,000 BC. Lascaux is famous for its ""exceptionally detailed depictions of humans and animals"".[28] The oldest traces of human life in what is now France date from approximately 1.8 million years ago.[29] Over the ensuing millennia, humans were confronted by a harsh and variable climate, marked by several glacial periods. Early hominids led a nomadic hunter-gatherer life.[29] France has a large number of decorated caves from the upper Palaeolithic era, including one of the most famous and best preserved, Lascaux[29] (approximately 18,000 BC). At the end of the last glacial period (10,000 BC), the climate became milder;[29] from approximately 7,000 BC, this part of Western Europe entered the Neolithic era and its inhabitants became sedentary. After strong demographic and agricultural development between the 4th and 3rd millennia, metallurgy appeared at the end of the 3rd millennium, initially working gold, copper and bronze, as well as later iron.[30] France has numerous megalithic sites from the Neolithic period, including the exceptionally dense Carnac stones site (approximately 3,300 BC). Antiquity (6th century BC–5th century AD) Main articles: Gaul, Celts, and Roman Gaul Vercingetorix surrenders to Caesar during the Battle of Alesia. The Gallic defeat in the Gallic Wars secured the Roman conquest of the country. In 600 BC, Ionian Greeks from Phocaea founded the colony of Massalia (present-day Marseille), on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. This makes it France's oldest city.[31][32] At the same time, some Gallic Celtic tribes penetrated parts of Eastern and Northern France, gradually spreading through the rest of the country between the 5th and 3rd century BC.[33] The concept of Gaul emerged during this period, corresponding to the territories of Celtic settlement ranging between the Rhine, the Atlantic Ocean, the Pyrenees and the Mediterranean. The borders of modern France roughly correspond to ancient Gaul, which was inhabited by Celtic Gauls. Gaul was then a prosperous country, of which the southernmost part was heavily subject to Greek and Roman cultural and economic influences. The Maison Carrée was a temple of the Gallo-Roman city of Nemausus (present-day Nîmes) and is one of the best-preserved vestiges of the Roman Empire. Around 390 BC, the Gallic chieftain Brennus and his troops made their way to Italy through the Alps, defeated the Romans in the Battle of the Allia, and besieged and ransomed Rome.[34] The Gallic invasion left Rome weakened, and the Gauls continued to harass the region until 345 BC when they entered into a formal peace treaty with Rome.[35] But the Romans and the Gauls would remain adversaries for the next centuries, and the Gauls would continue to be a threat in Italy.[36] Around 125 BC, the south of Gaul was conquered by the Romans, who called this region Provincia Nostra (""Our Province""), which over time evolved into the name Provence in French.[37] Julius Caesar conquered the remainder of Gaul and overcame a revolt carried out by the Gallic chieftain Vercingetorix in 52 BC.[38] According to Plutarch and the writings of scholar Brendan Woods, the Gallic Wars resulted in 800 conquered cities, 300 subdued tribes, one million men sold into slavery, and another three million dead in battle.[citation needed] Gaul was divided by Augustus into Roman provinces.[39] Many cities were founded during the Gallo-Roman period, including Lugdunum (present-day Lyon), which is considered the capital of the Gauls.[39] These cities were built in traditional Roman style, with a forum, a theatre, a circus, an amphitheatre and thermal baths. The Gauls mixed with Roman settlers and eventually adopted Roman culture and Roman speech (Latin, from which the French language evolved). The Roman polytheism merged with the Gallic paganism into the same syncretism. From the 250s to the 280s AD, Roman Gaul suffered a serious crisis with its fortified borders being attacked on several occasions by barbarians.[40] Nevertheless, the situation improved in the first half of the 4th century, which was a period of revival and prosperity for Roman Gaul.[41] In 312, Emperor Constantine I converted to Christianity. Subsequently, Christians, who had been persecuted until then, increased rapidly across the entire Roman Empire.[42] But, from the beginning of the 5th century, the Barbarian Invasions resumed.[43] Teutonic tribes invaded the region from present-day Germany, the Visigoths settling in the southwest, the Burgundians along the Rhine River Valley, and the Franks (from whom the French take their name) in the north.[44] Early Middle Ages (5th–10th century) Main articles: Francia, Merovingian dynasty, and Carolingian dynasty See also: List of French monarchs and France in the Middle Ages Frankish expansion from 481 to 870 At the end of the Antiquity period, ancient Gaul was divided into several Germanic kingdoms and a remaining Gallo-Roman territory, known as the Kingdom of Syagrius. Simultaneously, Celtic Britons, fleeing the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain, settled the western part of Armorica. As a result, the Armorican peninsula was renamed Brittany, Celtic culture was revived and independent petty kingdoms arose in this region. The first leader to make himself king of all the Franks was Clovis I, who began his reign in 481, routing the last forces of the Roman governors of the province in 486. Clovis claimed that he would be baptized a Christian in the event of his victory against the Visigoths, which was said to have guaranteed the battle. Clovis regained the southwest from the Visigoths, was baptized in 508, and made himself master of what is now western Germany. Clovis I was the first Germanic conqueror after the fall of the Roman Empire to convert to Catholic Christianity, rather than Arianism; thus France was given the title ""Eldest daughter of the Church"" (French: La fille aînée de l'Église) by the papacy,[45] and French kings would be called ""the Most Christian Kings of France"" (Rex Christianissimus). With Clovis's conversion to Catholicism in 498, the Frankish monarchy, elective and secular until then, became hereditary and of divine right. The Franks embraced the Christian Gallo-Roman culture and ancient Gaul was eventually renamed Francia (""Land of the Franks""). The Germanic Franks adopted Romanic languages, except in northern Gaul where Roman settlements were less dense and where Germanic languages emerged. Clovis made Paris his capital and established the Merovingian dynasty, but his kingdom would not survive his death. The Franks treated land purely as a private possession and divided it among their heirs, so four kingdoms emerged from Clovis's: Paris, Orléans, Soissons, and Rheims. The last Merovingian kings lost power to their mayors of the palace (head of household). One mayor of the palace, Charles Martel, defeated an Islamic invasion of Gaul at the Battle of Tours (732) and earned respect and power within the Frankish kingdoms. His son, Pepin the Short, seized the crown of Francia from the weakened Merovingians and founded the Carolingian dynasty. Pepin's son, Charlemagne, reunited the Frankish kingdoms and built a vast empire across Western and Central Europe. Proclaimed Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Leo III and thus establishing in earnest the French Government's longtime historical association with the Catholic Church,[46] Charlemagne tried to revive the Western Roman Empire and its cultural grandeur. Charlemagne's son, Louis I (Emperor 814–840), kept the empire united; however, this Carolingian Empire would not survive his death. In 843, under the Treaty of Verdun, the empire was divided between Louis' three sons, with East Francia going to Louis the German, Middle Francia to Lothair I, and West Francia to Charles the Bald. West Francia approximated the area occupied by, and was the precursor to, modern France.[47] During the 9th and 10th centuries, continually threatened by Viking invasions, France became a very decentralized state: the nobility's titles and lands became hereditary, and the authority of the king became more religious than secular and thus was less effective and constantly challenged by powerful noblemen. Thus was established feudalism in France. Over time, some of the king's vassals would grow so powerful that they often posed a threat to the king. For example, after the Battle of Hastings in 1066, William the Conqueror added ""King of England"" to his titles, becoming both the vassal to (as Duke of Normandy) and the equal of (as king of England) the king of France, creating recurring tensions. High and Late Middle Ages (10th–15th century) Main articles: Kingdom of France, Capetian dynasty, Valois dynasty, and Bourbon dynasty See also: List of French monarchs and France in the Middle Ages Joan of Arc led the French army to several important victories during the Hundred Years' War (1337–1453), which paved the way for the final victory. Metropolitan France territorial evolution from 985 to 1947 The Carolingian dynasty ruled France until 987, when Hugh Capet, Duke of France and Count of Paris, was crowned King of the Franks.[48] His descendants—the Capetians, the House of Valois and the House of Bourbon—progressively unified the country through wars and dynastic inheritance into the Kingdom of France, which was fully declared in 1190 by Philip II of France (Philippe Auguste). Later kings would expand their directly possessed domaine royal to cover over half of modern continental France by the 15th century, including most of the north, centre and west of France. During this process, the royal authority became more and more assertive, centered on a hierarchically conceived society distinguishing nobility, clergy, and commoners. The French nobility played a prominent role in most Crusades to restore Christian access to the Holy Land. French knights made up the bulk of the steady flow of reinforcements throughout the two-hundred-year span of the Crusades, in such a fashion that the Arabs uniformly referred to the crusaders as Franj caring little whether they really came from France.[49] The French Crusaders also imported the French language into the Levant, making French the base of the lingua franca (litt. ""Frankish language"") of the Crusader states.[49] French knights also made up the majority in both the Hospital and the Temple orders. The latter, in particular, held numerous properties throughout France and by the 13th century were the principal bankers for the French crown, until Philip IV annihilated the order in 1307. The Albigensian Crusade was launched in 1209 to eliminate the heretical Cathars in the southwestern area of modern-day France. In the end, the Cathars were exterminated and the autonomous County of Toulouse was annexed into the crown lands of France.[50] From the 11th century, the House of Plantagenet, the rulers of the County of Anjou, succeeded in establishing its dominion over the surrounding provinces of Maine and Touraine, then progressively built an ""empire"" that spanned from England to the Pyrenees and covering half of modern France. Tensions between the kingdom of France and the Plantagenet empire would last a hundred years, until Philip II of France conquered, between 1202 and 1214 most of the continental possessions of the empire, leaving England and Aquitaine to the Plantagenets. Following the Battle of Bouvines. Charles IV the Fair died without an heir in 1328.[51] Under the rules of the Salic law the crown of France could not pass to a woman nor could the line of kingship pass through the female line.[51] Accordingly, the crown passed to Philip of Valois, rather than through the female line to Edward of Plantagenet, who would soon become Edward III of England. During the reign of Philip of Valois, the French monarchy reached the height of its medieval power.[51] However Philip's seat on the throne was contested by Edward III of England in 1337, and England and France entered the off-and-on Hundred Years' War.[52] The exact boundaries changed greatly with time, but landholdings inside France by the English Kings remained extensive for decades. With charismatic leaders, such as Joan of Arc and La Hire, strong French counterattacks won back most English continental territories. Like the rest of Europe, France was struck by the Black Death; half of the 17 million population of France died.[53][54] Early modern period (15th century–1789) Main articles: French Renaissance, Early modern France, and Ancien Régime The Château de Chenonceau, nowadays part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site, was built in the early 16th century. The French Renaissance saw a spectacular cultural development and the first standardisation of the French language, which would become the official language of France and the language of Europe's aristocracy. It also saw a long set of wars, known as the Italian Wars, between France and the House of Habsburg. French explorers, such as Jacques Cartier or Samuel de Champlain, claimed lands in the Americas for France, paving the way for the expansion of the First French colonial empire. The rise of Protestantism in Europe led France to a civil war known as the French Wars of Religion, where, in the most notorious incident, thousands of Huguenots were murdered in the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of 1572.[55] The Wars of Religion were ended by Henry IV's Edict of Nantes, which granted some freedom of religion to the Huguenots. Spanish troops, the terror of Western Europe,[56] assisted the Catholic side during the Wars of Religion in 1589–1594, and invaded northern France in 1597; after some skirmishing in the 1620s and 1630s, Spain and France returned to all-out war between 1635 and 1659. The war cost France 300,000 casualties.[57] Under Louis XIII, the energetic Cardinal Richelieu promoted the centralisation of the state and reinforced the royal power by disarming domestic power holders in the 1620s. He systematically destroyed castles of defiant lords and denounced the use of private violence (dueling, carrying weapons and maintaining private armies). By the end of the 1620s, Richelieu established ""the royal monopoly of force"" as the doctrine.[58] During Louis XIV's minority and the regency of Queen Anne and Cardinal Mazarin, a period of trouble known as the Fronde occurred in France. This rebellion was driven by the great feudal lords and sovereign courts as a reaction to the rise of royal absolute power in France. Louis XIV, the ""sun king"" was the absolute monarch of France and made France the leading European power. The monarchy reached its peak during the 17th century and the reign of Louis XIV (1643–1715). By turning powerful feudal lords into courtiers at the Palace of Versailles, Louis XIV's personal power became unchallenged. Remembered for his numerous wars, he made France the leading European power. France became the most populous country in Europe and had tremendous influence over European politics, economy, and culture. French became the most-used language in diplomacy, science, literature and international affairs, and remained so until the 20th century.[59] France obtained many overseas possessions in the Americas, Africa and Asia. Louis XIV also revoked the Edict of Nantes, forcing thousands of Huguenots into exile. Under the wars of Louis XV (r. 1715–1774), France lost New France and most of its Indian possessions after its defeat in the Seven Years' War (1756–1763). Its European territory kept growing, however, with notable acquisitions such as Lorraine (1766) and Corsica (1770). An unpopular king, Louis XV's weak rule, his ill-advised financial, political and military decisions – as well as the debauchery of his court– discredited the monarchy, which arguably paved the way for the French Revolution 15 years after his death.[60][61] Louis XVI (r. 1774–1793), actively supported the Americans with money, fleets and armies, helping them win independence from Great Britain. France gained revenge but spent so heavily that the government verged on bankruptcy--a factor that contributed to the French Revolution. Much of the Enlightenment occurred in French intellectual circles, and major scientific breakthroughs and inventions, such as the discovery of oxygen (1778) and the first hot air balloon carrying passengers (1783), were achieved by French scientists. French explorers, such as Bougainville and Lapérouse, took part in the voyages of scientific exploration through maritime expeditions around the globe. The Enlightenment philosophy, in which reason is advocated as the primary source for legitimacy, undermined the power of and support for the monarchy and also was a factor in the French Revolution. Revolutionary France (1789–1799) Main articles: History of France § Revolutionary France (1789–1799), and French Revolution Ouverture des États généraux à Versailles, 5 mai 1789 by Auguste Couder The Storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789 was the most emblematic event of the French Revolution. Facing financial troubles, King Louis XVI summoned the Estates-General (gathering the three Estates of the realm) in May 1789 to propose solutions to his government. As it came to an impasse, the representatives of the Third Estate formed into a National Assembly, signalling the outbreak of the French Revolution. Fearing that the king would suppress the newly created National Assembly, insurgents stormed the Bastille on 14 July 1789, a date which would become France's National Day. In early August 1789, the National Constituent Assembly abolished the privileges of the nobility such as personal serfdom and exclusive hunting rights. Through the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (27 August 1789) France established fundamental rights for men. The Declaration affirms ""the natural and imprescriptible rights of man"" to ""liberty, property, security and resistance to oppression"". Freedom of speech and press were declared, and arbitrary arrests outlawed. It called for the destruction of aristocratic privileges and proclaimed freedom and equal rights for all men, as well as access to public office based on talent rather than birth. In November 1789, the Assembly decided to nationalise and sell all property of the Catholic Church which had been the largest landowner in the country. In July 1790, a Civil Constitution of the Clergy reorganized the French Catholic Church, cancelling the authority of the Church to levy taxes, et cetera. This fueled much discontent in parts of France, which would contribute to the civil war breaking out some years later. While King Louis XVI still enjoyed popularity among the population, his disastrous flight to Varennes (June 1791) seemed to justify rumors he had tied his hopes of political salvation to the prospects of foreign invasion. His credibility was so deeply undermined that the abolition of the monarchy and establishment of a republic became an increasing possibility. In August 1791, the Emperor of Austria and the King of Prussia in the Declaration of Pillnitz threatened revolutionary France to intervene by force of arms to restore the French absolute monarchy. In September 1791, the National Constituent Assembly forced King Louis XVI to accept the French Constitution of 1791, thus turning the French absolute monarchy into a constitutional monarchy. In the newly established Legislative Assembly (October 1791), enmity developed and deepened between a group, later called the 'Girondins', who favored war with Austria and Prussia, and a group later called 'Montagnards' or 'Jacobins', who opposed such a war. A majority in the Assembly in 1792 however saw a war with Austria and Prussia as a chance to boost the popularity of the revolutionary government, and thought that France would win a war against those gathered monarchies. On 20 April 1792, therefore, they declared war on Austria. Le Serment du Jeu de paume by Jacques-Louis David, 1791 On 10 August 1792, an angry crowd threatened the palace of King Louis XVI, who took refuge in the Legislative Assembly.[62][63] A Prussian Army invaded France later in August 1792. In early September, Parisians, infuriated by the Prussian Army capturing Verdun and counter-revolutionary uprisings in the west of France, murdered between 1,000 and 1,500 prisoners by raiding the Parisian prisons. The Assembly and the Paris City Council seemed unable to stop that bloodshed.[62][64] The National Convention, chosen in the first elections under male universal suffrage,[62] on 20 September 1792 succeeded the Legislative Assembly and on 21 September abolished the monarchy by proclaiming the French First Republic. Ex-King Louis XVI was convicted of treason and guillotined in January 1793. France had declared war on Great Britain and the Dutch Republic in November 1792 and did the same on Spain in March 1793; in the spring of 1793, Austria and Prussia invaded France; in March, France created a ""sister republic"" in the ""Republic of Mainz"", and kept it under control. Also in March 1793, the civil war of the Vendée against Paris started, evoked by both the Civil Constitution of the Clergy of 1790 and the nationwide army conscription early 1793; elsewhere in France rebellion was brewing too. A factionalist feud in the National Convention, smoldering ever since October 1791, came to a climax with the group of the 'Girondins' on 2 June 1793 being forced to resign and leave the convention. The counter-revolution, begun in March 1793 in the Vendée, by July had spread to Brittany, Normandy, Bordeaux, Marseilles, Toulon, and Lyon. Paris' Convention government between October and December 1793 with brutal measures managed to subdue most internal uprisings, at the cost of tens of thousands of lives. Some historians consider the civil war to have lasted until 1796 with a toll of possibly 450,000 lives.[65][66] By the end of 1793 the allies had been driven from France. France in February 1794 abolished slavery in its American colonies, but would reintroduce it later. Political disagreements and enmity in the National Convention between October 1793 and July 1794 reached unprecedented levels, leading to dozens of Convention members being sentenced to death and guillotined. Meanwhile, France's external wars in 1794 were going prosperous, for example in Belgium. In 1795, the government seemed to return to indifference towards the desires and needs of the lower classes concerning freedom of (Catholic) religion and fair distribution of food. Until 1799, politicians, apart from inventing a new parliamentary system (the 'Directory'), busied themselves with dissuading the people from Catholicism and from royalism. Napoleon and 19th century (1799–1914) Main articles: History of France § Napoleonic France (1799–1815); History of France § Long 19th century, 1815–1914; First French Empire; Second French Empire; and French colonial empire See also: France in the 19th century and France in the 20th century Napoleon, Emperor of the French, built a vast empire across Europe. His conquests spread the ideals of the French Revolution across much of the continent, such as popular sovereignty, equality before the law, republicanism and administrative reorganisation while his legal reforms had a major impact worldwide. Nationalism, especially in Germany, emerged in reaction against him.[67] Napoleon Bonaparte seized control of the Republic in 1799 becoming First Consul and later Emperor of the French Empire (1804–1814; 1815). As a continuation of the wars sparked by the European monarchies against the French Republic, changing sets of European Coalitions declared wars on Napoleon's Empire. His armies conquered most of continental Europe with swift victories such as the battles of Jena-Auerstadt or Austerlitz. Members of the Bonaparte family were appointed as monarchs in some of the newly established kingdoms.[68] These victories led to the worldwide expansion of French revolutionary ideals and reforms, such as the metric system, the Napoleonic Code and the Declaration of the Rights of Man. In June 1812, Napoleon attacked Russia, reaching Moscow. Thereafter his army disintegrated through supply problems, disease, Russian attacks, and finally winter. After the catastrophic Russian campaign, and the ensuing uprising of European monarchies against his rule, Napoleon was defeated and the Bourbon monarchy restored. About a million Frenchmen died during the Napoleonic Wars.[68] After his brief return from exile, Napoleon was finally defeated in 1815 at the Battle of Waterloo, the monarchy was re-established (1815–1830), with new constitutional limitations. The discredited Bourbon dynasty was overthrown by the July Revolution of 1830, which established the constitutional July Monarchy. In that year, French troops conquered Algeria, establishing the first colonial presence in Africa since Napoleon's abortive invasion of Egypt in 1798. In 1848, general unrest led to the February Revolution and the end of the July Monarchy. The abolition of slavery and introduction of male universal suffrage, which were briefly enacted during the French Revolution, were re-enacted in 1848. In 1852, the president of the French Republic, Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte, Napoleon I's nephew, was proclaimed emperor of the Second Empire, as Napoleon III. He multiplied French interventions abroad, especially in Crimea, in Mexico and Italy which resulted in the annexation of the Duchy of Savoy and the County of Nice, then part of the Kingdom of Sardinia. Napoleon III was unseated following defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 and his regime was replaced by the Third Republic. By 1875, the French conquest of Algeria was complete and approximately 825,000 Algerians were killed as a result.[69] Animated map of the growth and decline of the French colonial empire France had colonial possessions, in various forms, since the beginning of the 17th century, but in the 19th and 20th centuries, its global overseas colonial empire extended greatly and became the second largest in the world behind the British Empire. Including metropolitan France, the total area of land under French sovereignty almost reached 13 million square kilometers in the 1920s and 1930s, 8.6% of the world's land. Known as the Belle Époque, the turn of the century was a period characterised by optimism, regional peace, economic prosperity and technological, scientific and cultural innovations. In 1905, state secularism was officially established. Contemporary period (1914–present) Main article: History of France (1900 to present) French Poilus posing with their war-torn flag in 1917, during World War I France was invaded by Germany and defended by Great Britain to start World War I in August 1914. A rich industrial area in the northeast was occupied. France and the Allies emerged victorious against the Central Powers at a tremendous human and material cost. World War I left 1.4 million French soldiers dead, 4% of its population.[70] Between 27 and 30% of soldiers conscripted from 1912 to 1915 were killed.[71] The interbellum years were marked by intense international tensions and a variety of social reforms introduced by the Popular Front government (annual leave, eight-hour workdays, women in government). In 1940, France was invaded and quickly defeated by Nazi Germany. France was divided into a German occupation zone in the north, an Italian occupation zone in the southeast and an unoccupied territory, the rest of France, which consisted of the southern French metropolitan territory (two-fifths of pre-war metropolitan France) and the French empire, which included the two protectorates of French Tunisia and French Morocco, and French Algeria; the Vichy government, a newly established authoritarian regime collaborating with Germany, ruled the unoccupied territory. Free France, the government-in-exile led by Charles de Gaulle, was set up in London.[72][full citation needed] From 1942 to 1944, about 160,000 French citizens, including around 75,000 Jews,[72][73][74] were deported to death camps and concentration camps in Germany and occupied Poland.[75] In September 1943, Corsica was the first French metropolitan territory to liberate itself from the Axis. On 6 June 1944, the Allies invaded Normandy and in August they invaded Provence. Over the following year the Allies and the French Resistance emerged victorious over the Axis powers and French sovereignty was restored with the establishment of the Provisional Government of the French Republic (GPRF). This interim government, established by de Gaulle, aimed to continue to wage war against Germany and to purge collaborators from office. It also made several important reforms (suffrage extended to women, creation of a social security system). Charles de Gaulle took an active part in many major events of the 20th century: a hero of World War I, leader of the Free French during World War II, he then became President, where he facilitated decolonisation, maintained France as a major power and overcame the revolt of May 1968. The GPRF laid the groundwork for a new constitutional order that resulted in the Fourth Republic, which saw spectacular economic growth (les Trente Glorieuses). France was one of the founding members of NATO (1949). France attempted to regain control of French Indochina but was defeated by the Viet Minh in 1954 at the climactic Battle of Dien Bien Phu. Only months later, France faced another anti-colonialist conflict in Algeria. The systematic torture and repression, as well as the extrajudicial killings that were perpetrated to keep control of Algeria, then treated as an integral part of France and home to over one million European settlers,[76][77] wracked the country and nearly led to a coup and civil war.[78] In 1958, the weak and unstable Fourth Republic gave way to the Fifth Republic, which included a strengthened Presidency.[79] In the latter role, Charles de Gaulle managed to keep the country together while taking steps to end the Algerian War. The war was concluded with the Évian Accords in 1962 that led to Algerian independence. The Algerian independence came at a high price: namely, the large toll on the Algerian population. It resulted in half million to a million deaths and over 2 million internally displaced Algerians.[80][81][82] A vestige of the colonial empire are the French overseas departments and territories. The May 68 protests, a massive social movement, would ultimately led to many social changes, such as the right to abortion, women empowerment as well as the decriminalisation of homosexuality.[83][84] In the context of the Cold War, De Gaulle pursued a policy of ""national independence"" towards the Western and Eastern blocs. To this end, he withdrew from NATO's military integrated command (while remaining in the NATO alliance itself), launched a nuclear development programme and made France the fourth nuclear power. He restored cordial Franco-German relations to create a European counterweight between the American and Soviet spheres of influence. However, he opposed any development of a supranational Europe, favouring a Europe of sovereign nations. In the wake of the series of worldwide protests of 1968, the revolt of May 1968 had an enormous social impact. In France, it was the watershed moment when a conservative moral ideal (religion, patriotism, respect for authority) shifted towards a more liberal moral ideal (secularism, individualism, sexual revolution). Although the revolt was a political failure (as the Gaullist party emerged even stronger than before) it announced a split between the French people and de Gaulle who resigned shortly after.[85] In the post-Gaullist era, France remained one of the most developed economies in the world, but faced several economic crises that resulted in high unemployment rates and increasing public debt. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries France has been at the forefront of the development of a supranational European Union, notably by signing the Maastricht Treaty (which created the European Union) in 1992, establishing the Eurozone in 1999 and signing the Lisbon Treaty in 2007.[86] France has also gradually but fully reintegrated into NATO and has since participated in most NATO sponsored wars.[87] Republican marches were organised across France after the January 2015 attacks perpetrated by Islamist terrorists; they became the largest public rallies in French history. Since the 19th century France has received many immigrants. These have been mostly male foreign workers from European Catholic countries who generally returned home when not employed.[88] During the 1970s France faced economic crisis and allowed new immigrants (mostly from the Maghreb)[88] to permanently settle in France with their families and to acquire French citizenship. It resulted in hundreds of thousands of Muslims (especially in the larger cities) living in subsidised public housing and suffering from very high unemployment rates.[89] Simultaneously France renounced the assimilation of immigrants, where they were expected to adhere to French traditional values and cultural norms. They were encouraged to retain their distinctive cultures and traditions and required merely to integrate.[90] Since the 1995 Paris Métro and RER bombings, France has been sporadically targeted by Islamist organisations, notably the Charlie Hebdo attack in January 2015 which provoked the largest public rallies in French history, gathering 4.4 million people,[91][92] the November 2015 Paris attacks which resulted in 130 deaths, the deadliest attack on French soil since World War II[93][94] and the deadliest in the European Union since the Madrid train bombings in 2004,[95] as well as the 2016 Nice truck attack, which caused 87 deaths during Bastille Day celebrations. Opération Chammal, France's military efforts to contain ISIS, killed over 1,000 ISIS troops between 2014 and 2015.[96][97] Geography Main article: Geography of France Location and borders A relief map of Metropolitan France, showing cities with over 100,000 inhabitants Mont Blanc, the highest summit in Western Europe, marks the border with Italy. The vast majority of France's territory and population is situated in Western Europe and is called Metropolitan France, to distinguish it from the country's various overseas polities. It is bordered by the North Sea in the north, the English Channel in the northwest, the Atlantic Ocean in the west and the Mediterranean sea in the southeast. Its land borders consist of Belgium and Luxembourg in the northeast, Germany and Switzerland in the east, Italy and Monaco in the southeast, and Andorra and Spain in the south and southwest. With the exception of the northeast, most of France's land borders are roughly delineated by natural boundaries and geographic features: to the south and southeast, the Pyrenees and the Alps and the Jura, respectively, and to the east, the Rhine river. Due to its shape, France is often referred to as l'Hexagone (""The Hexagon""). Metropolitan France includes various coastal islands, of which the largest is Corsica. Metropolitan France is situated mostly between latitudes 41° and 51° N, and longitudes 6° W and 10° E, on the western edge of Europe, and thus lies within the northern temperate zone. Its continental part covers about 1000 km from north to south and from east to west. France has several overseas regions across the world, which are organized as follows: In South America: French Guiana. In the Atlantic Ocean: Saint Pierre and Miquelon and, in the Antilles: Guadeloupe, Martinique, Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy. In the Pacific Ocean: French Polynesia, the special collectivity of New Caledonia, Wallis and Futuna and Clipperton Island. In the Indian Ocean: Réunion island, Mayotte, Kerguelen Islands, Crozet Islands, St. Paul and Amsterdam islands, and the Scattered Islands in the Indian Ocean In the Antarctic: Adélie Land. France has land borders with Brazil and Suriname via French Guiana and with the Kingdom of the Netherlands through the French portion of Saint Martin. Metropolitan France covers 551,500 square kilometres (212,935 sq mi),[98] the largest among European Union members.[20] France's total land area, with its overseas departments and territories (excluding Adélie Land), is 643,801 km2 (248,573 sq mi), 0.45% of the total land area on Earth. France possesses a wide variety of landscapes, from coastal plains in the north and west to mountain ranges of the Alps in the southeast, the Massif Central in the south central and Pyrenees in the southwest. Due to its numerous overseas departments and territories scattered across the planet, France possesses the second-largest Exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the world, covering 11,035,000 km2 (4,260,000 mi2), just behind the EEZ of the United States, which covers 11,351,000 km2 (4,383,000 mi2), but ahead of the EEZ of Australia, which covers 8,148,250 km2 (4,111,312 mi2). Its EEZ covers approximately 8% of the total surface of all the EEZs of the world. Geology, topography and hydrography Geological formations near Roussillon, Vaucluse Metropolitan France has a wide variety of topographical sets and natural landscapes. Large parts of the current territory of France were raised during several tectonic episodes like the Hercynian uplift in the Paleozoic Era, during which the Armorican Massif, the Massif Central, the Morvan, the Vosges and Ardennes ranges and the island of Corsica were formed. These massifs delineate several sedimentary basins such as the Aquitaine basin in the southwest and the Paris basin in the north, the latter including several areas of particularly fertile ground such as the silt beds of Beauce and Brie. Various routes of natural passage, such as the Rhône Valley, allow easy communications. The Alpine, Pyrenean and Jura mountains are much younger and have less eroded forms. At 4,810.45 metres (15,782 ft)[99] above sea level, Mont Blanc, located in the Alps on the French and Italian border, is the highest point in Western Europe. Although 60% of municipalities are classified as having seismic risks, these risks remain moderate. Reed bed on the Gironde estuary, the largest estuary in Western Europe The coastlines offer contrasting landscapes: mountain ranges along the French Riviera, coastal cliffs such as the Côte d'Albâtre, and wide sandy plains in the Languedoc. Corsica lies off the Mediterranean coast. France has an extensive river system consisting of the four major rivers Seine, the Loire, the Garonne, the Rhône and their tributaries, whose combined catchment includes over 62% of the metropolitan territory. The Rhône divides the Massif Central from the Alps and flows into the Mediterranean Sea at the Camargue. The Garonne meets the Dordogne just after Bordeaux, forming the Gironde estuary, the largest estuary in Western Europe which after approximately 100 kilometres (62 mi) empties into the Atlantic Ocean.[100] Other water courses drain towards the Meuse and Rhine along the north-eastern borders. France has 11 million square kilometres (4.2×10^6 sq mi) of marine waters within three oceans under its jurisdiction, of which 97% are overseas. Climate Köppen climate classification map of Metropolitan France The French metropolitan territory is relatively large, so the climate is not uniform, giving rise to the following climate nuances: • The hot-summer mediterranean climate (Csa) is found along the Gulf of Lion.

Climate change in France includes above average heating.[101] Environment See also: List of national parks of France and Regional natural parks of France Marine (blue), regional (green) and national (red) parks in France (2019) France was one of the first countries to create an environment ministry, in 1971.[102] Although it is one of the most industrialised countries in the world, France is ranked only 19th by carbon dioxide emissions, behind less populous nations such as Canada or Australia. This is due to the country's heavy investment in nuclear power following the 1973 oil crisis,[103] which now accounts for 75 percent of its electricity production[104] and results in less pollution.[105][106] According to the 2018 Environmental Performance Index conducted by Yale and Columbia, France was the second-most environmentally-conscious country in the world (after Switzerland), compared to tenth place in 2016 and 27th in 2014.[107][108] The forest of Rambouillet in Yvelines illustrates France's flora diversity. Like all European Union state members, France agreed to cut carbon emissions by at least 20% of 1990 levels by the year 2020,[109] compared to the United States plan to reduce emissions by 4% of 1990 levels.[110] As of 2009[update], French carbon dioxide emissions per capita were lower than that of China's.[111] The country was set to impose a carbon tax in 2009 at 17 euros per tonne of carbon emitted,[112] which would have raised 4 billion euros of revenue annually.[113] However, the plan was abandoned due to fears of burdening French businesses.[114] Calanques National Park in Bouches-du-Rhône is one of the best known protected areas of France. Forests account for 31 percent of France's land area—the fourth-highest proportion in Europe—representing an increase of 7 percent since 1990.[115][116][117] French forests are some of the most diverse in Europe, comprising more than 140 species of trees.[118] France had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 4.52/10, ranking it 123rd globally out of 172 countries.[119] There are nine national parks[120] and 46 natural parks in France,[121] with the government planning to convert 20% of its Exclusive economic zone into a Marine protected area by 2020.[122] A regional nature park[123] (French: parc naturel régional or PNR) is a public establishment in France between local authorities and the national government covering an inhabited rural area of outstanding beauty, to protect the scenery and heritage as well as setting up sustainable economic development in the area.[124] A PNR sets goals and guidelines for managed human habitation, sustainable economic development and protection of the natural environment based on each park's unique landscape and heritage. The parks foster ecological research programs and public education in the natural sciences.[125] As of 2019[update] there are 54 PNRs in France.[126] Administrative divisions Main article: Administrative divisions of France The French Republic is divided into 18 regions (located in Europe and overseas), five overseas collectivities, one overseas territory, one special collectivity – New Caledonia and one uninhabited island directly under the authority of the Minister of Overseas France – Clipperton. Regions Hauts-de-France Normandy Île-de-France Grand Est Bourgogne-Franche-Comté Centre-Val de Loire Pays de la Loire Brittany Nouvelle-Aquitaine Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes Occitanie Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur Corsica French Guiana Guadeloupe Martinique Mayotte RéunionBelgium Luxembourg Germany Switzerland Italy United Kingdom Andorra Brazil Suriname SpainChannel Bay ofBiscay LigurianSea MediterraneanSea Since 2016, France is mainly divided into 18 administrative regions: 13 regions in metropolitan France (including the territorial collectivity of Corsica),[127] and five located overseas.[98] The regions are further subdivided into 101 departments,[128] which are numbered mainly alphabetically. This number is used in postal codes and was formerly used on vehicle number plates. Among the 101 departments of France, five (French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mayotte, and Réunion) are in overseas regions (ROMs) that are also simultaneously overseas departments (DOMs), enjoy exactly the same status as metropolitan departments and are an integral part of the European Union. The 101 departments are subdivided into 335 arrondissements, which are, in turn, subdivided into 2,054 cantons.[129] These cantons are then divided into 36,658 communes, which are municipalities with an elected municipal council.[129] Three communes—Paris, Lyon and Marseille—are subdivided into 45 municipal arrondissements. The regions, departments and communes are all known as territorial collectivities, meaning they possess local assemblies as well as an executive. Arrondissements and cantons are merely administrative divisions. However, this was not always the case. Until 1940, the arrondissements were territorial collectivities with an elected assembly, but these were suspended by the Vichy regime and definitely abolished by the Fourth Republic in 1946. Overseas territories and collectivities In addition to the 18 regions and 101 departments, the French Republic has five overseas collectivities (French Polynesia, Saint Barthélemy, Saint Martin, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and Wallis and Futuna), one sui generis collectivity (New Caledonia), one overseas territory (French Southern and Antarctic Lands), and one island possession in the Pacific Ocean (Clipperton Island). Overseas collectivities and territories form part of the French Republic, but do not form part of the European Union or its fiscal area (with the exception of St. Bartelemy, which seceded from Guadeloupe in 2007). The Pacific Collectivities (COMs) of French Polynesia, Wallis and Futuna, and New Caledonia continue to use the CFP franc[130] whose value is strictly linked to that of the euro. In contrast, the five overseas regions used the French franc and now use the euro.[131] The lands making up the French Republic, shown at the same geographic scale Name Constitutional status Capital Clipperton Island State private property under the direct authority of the French government Uninhabited French Polynesia Designated as an overseas land (pays d'outre-mer or POM), the status is the same as an overseas collectivity.

Mata-Utu Politics Main article: Politics of France Government Emmanuel MacronPresident Jean CastexPrime minister France is representative democracy organised as a unitary, semi-presidential republic.[132] As one of the earliest republics of the modern world, democratic traditions and values are deeply rooted in French culture, identity, and politics.[133] The Constitution of the Fifth Republic was approved by referendum on 28 September 1958, establishing a framework consisting of executive, legislative, and judicial branches.[134] It sought to address the instability of the Third and Fourth republics by combining elements of both parliamentary and presidential systems, while greatly strengthening the authority of the executive relative to the legislature.[133] The executive branch has two leaders. The president of the Republic, currently Emmanuel Macron, is the head of state, elected directly by universal adult suffrage for a five-year term.[135] The prime minister, currently Jean Castex, is the head of government, appointed by the president of the Republic to lead the Government of France. The French president has the power to dissolve the parliament or circumvent it by submitting referenda directly to the people; the president also appoints high ranking judges and civil servants, negotiates and ratifies international agreements, and serves as commander-in-chief of the armed forces. The prime minister determines public policy and oversees the civil service, with an emphasis on domestic matters.[136] The National Assembly is the lower house of the French Parliament. The legislature consists of the French Parliament, a bicameral body comprising a lower house, the National Assembly (Assemblée nationale) and an upper house, the Senate.[137] Legislators in the National Assembly, known as députés, represent local constituencies and are directly elected for five-year terms.[138] The Assembly has the power to dismiss the government by majority vote. Senators are chosen by an electoral college for six-year terms, with half the seats submitted to election every three years.[139] The Senate's legislative powers are limited; in the event of disagreement between the two chambers, the National Assembly has the final say.[140] The parliament is responsible for determining the rules and principles concerning most areas of law, political amnesty, and fiscal policy; however, the government may draft the specific details concerning most laws. Until World War II, Radicals were a strong political force in France, embodied by the Republican, Radical and Radical-Socialist Party which was the most important party of the Third Republic. Since World War II, they were marginalized while French politics became characterized by two politically opposed groupings: one left-wing, centred on the French Section of the Workers' International and its successor the Socialist Party (since 1969); and the other right-wing, centred on the Gaullist Party, whose name changed over time to the Rally of the French People (1947), the Union of Democrats for the Republic (1958), the Rally for the Republic (1976), the Union for a Popular Movement (2007) and The Republicans (since 2015). In the 2017 presidential and legislative elections, radical centrist party En Marche! became the dominant force, overtaking both Socialists and Republicans. The electorate is constitutionally empowered to vote on amendments passed by the Parliament and bills submitted by the president. Referenda have played a key role in shaping French politics and even foreign policy; voters have decided on such matters as Algeria's independence, the election of the president by popular vote, the formation of the EU, and the reduction of presidential term limits.[141] Waning civic participation has been a matter of rigorous public debate, with a majority of the public reportedly supporting mandatory voting as a solution in 2019. However, at least as of 2017, voter turnout was 75 percent during recent elections, higher than the OECD average of 68 percent.[142] Law Main article: Law of France France uses a civil legal system, wherein law arises primarily from written statutes;[98] judges are not to make law, but merely to interpret it (though the amount of judicial interpretation in certain areas makes it equivalent to case law in a common law system). Basic principles of the rule of law were laid in the Napoleonic Code (which was, in turn, largely based on the royal law codified under Louis XIV). In agreement with the principles of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, law should only prohibit actions detrimental to society. As Guy Canivet, first president of the Court of Cassation, wrote about the management of prisons: ""Freedom is the rule, and its restriction is the exception; any restriction of Freedom must be provided for by Law and must follow the principles of necessity and proportionality."" That is, Law should lay out prohibitions only if they are needed, and if the inconveniences caused by this restriction do not exceed the inconveniences that the prohibition is supposed to remedy. The basic principles that the French Republic must respect are found in the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. French law is divided into two principal areas: private law and public law. Private law includes, in particular, civil law and criminal law. Public law includes, in particular, administrative law and constitutional law. However, in practical terms, French law comprises three principal areas of law: civil law, criminal law, and administrative law. Criminal laws can only address the future and not the past (criminal ex post facto laws are prohibited).[143] While administrative law is often a subcategory of civil law in many countries, it is completely separated in France and each body of law is headed by a specific supreme court: ordinary courts (which handle criminal and civil litigation) are headed by the Court of Cassation and administrative courts are headed by the Council of State. To be applicable, every law must be officially published in the Journal officiel de la République française. France does not recognise religious law as a motivation for the enactment of prohibitions; it has long abolished blasphemy laws and sodomy laws (the latter in 1791). However, ""offences against public decency"" (contraires aux bonnes mœurs) or disturbing public order (trouble à l'ordre public) have been used to repress public expressions of homosexuality or street prostitution. Since 1999, civil unions for homosexual couples are permitted, and since 2013, same-sex marriage and LGBT adoption are legal.[144] Laws prohibiting discriminatory speech in the press are as old as 1881. Some consider hate speech laws in France to be too broad or severe, undermining freedom of speech.[145] France has laws against racism and antisemitism,[146] while the 1990 Gayssot Act prohibits Holocaust denial. Freedom of religion is constitutionally guaranteed by the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. The 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State is the basis for laïcité (state secularism): the state does not formally recognize any religion, except in Alsace-Moselle. Nonetheless, it does recognize religious associations. The Parliament has listed many religious movements as dangerous cults since 1995, and has banned wearing conspicuous religious symbols in schools since 2004. In 2010, it banned the wearing of face-covering Islamic veils in public; human rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch described the law as discriminatory towards Muslims.[147][148] However, it is supported by most of the population.[149] Foreign relations Main article: Foreign relations of France 88 states and governments are part of La Francophonie,[150] which promotes values of democracy, multilingualism and cultural diversity.[151] France has been a key member of this global organization since its inception in 1970. France is a founding member of the United Nations and serves as one of the permanent members of the UN Security Council with veto rights.[152] In 2015, it was described as ""the best networked state in the world"" due to its membership in more international institutions than any other country;[153] these include the G7, World Trade Organization (WTO),[154] the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC)[155] and the Indian Ocean Commission (COI).[156] It is an associate member of the Association of Caribbean States (ACS)[157] and a leading member of the International Francophone Organisation (OIF) of 84 French-speaking countries.[158] As a significant hub for international relations, France has the third largest assembly of diplomatic missions, second only to China and the United States, which are far more populous. It also hosts the headquarters of several international organisations, including the OECD, UNESCO, Interpol, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, and the OIF.[159] Postwar French foreign policy has been largely shaped by membership of the European Union, of which it was a founding member. Since the 1960s, France has developed close ties with reunified Germany to become the most influential driving force of the EU.[160] In the 1960s, France sought to exclude the British from the European unification process,[161] seeking to build its own standing in continental Europe. However, since 1904, France has maintained an ""Entente cordiale"" with the United Kingdom, and there has been a strengthening of links between the countries, especially militarily. The European Parliament in Strasbourg, near the border with (Germany). France is a founding member of all EU institutions. France is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), but under President de Gaulle excluded itself from the joint military command, in protest of the Special Relationship between the United States and Britain, and to preserve the independence of French foreign and security policies. Under Nicolas Sarkozy, France re-joined the NATO joint military command on 4 April 2009.[162][163][164] In the early 1990s, the country drew considerable criticism from other nations for its underground nuclear tests in French Polynesia.[165] France vigorously opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq,[166][167] straining bilateral relations with the United States[168][169] and the United Kingdom. France retains strong political and economic influence in its former African colonies (Françafrique)[170] and has supplied economic aid and troops for peacekeeping missions in Ivory Coast and Chad.[171] Recently, after the unilateral declaration of independence of Northern Mali by the Tuareg MNLA and the subsequent regional Northern Mali conflict with several Islamist groups including Ansar Dine and MOJWA, France and other African states intervened to help the Malian Army to retake control. In 2017, France was the world's fourth-largest donor of development aid in absolute terms, behind the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom.[172] This represents 0.43% of its GNP, the 12th highest among the OECD.[173] Aid is provided by the governmental French Development Agency, which finances primarily humanitarian projects in sub-Saharan Africa,[174] with an emphasis on ""developing infrastructure, access to health care and education, the implementation of appropriate economic policies and the consolidation of the rule of law and democracy"".[174] Military Main article: French Armed Forces Examples of France's military. Clockwise from top left: nuclear aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle; a Dassault Rafale fighter aircraft; French Chasseurs Alpins patrolling the valleys of Kapisa province in Afghanistan; a Leclerc tank The French Armed Forces (Forces armées françaises) are the military and paramilitary forces of France, under the President of the Republic as supreme commander. They consist of the French Army (Armée de Terre), French Navy (Marine Nationale, formerly called Armée de Mer), the French Air and Space Force (Armée de l'Air et de l’Espace), and the Military Police called National Gendarmerie (Gendarmerie nationale), which also fulfils civil police duties in the rural areas of France. Together they are among the largest armed forces in the world and the largest in the EU. According to a 2018 study by Crédit Suisse, the French Armed Forces are ranked as the world's sixth-most powerful military, and the most powerful in Europe, only behind Russia.[175] While the Gendarmerie is an integral part of the French armed forces (gendarmes are career soldiers), and therefore under the purview of the Ministry of the Armed Forces, it is operationally attached to the Ministry of the Interior as far as its civil police duties are concerned. When acting as general purpose police force, the Gendarmerie encompasses the counter terrorist units of the Parachute Intervention Squadron of the National Gendarmerie (Escadron Parachutiste d'Intervention de la Gendarmerie Nationale), the National Gendarmerie Intervention Group (Groupe d'Intervention de la Gendarmerie Nationale), the Search Sections of the National Gendarmerie (Sections de Recherche de la Gendarmerie Nationale), responsible for criminal enquiries, and the Mobile Brigades of the National Gendarmerie (Brigades mobiles de la Gendarmerie Nationale, or in short Gendarmerie mobile) which have the task to maintain public order. The following special units are also part of the Gendarmerie: the Republican Guard (Garde républicaine) which protects public buildings hosting major French institutions, the Maritime Gendarmerie (Gendarmerie maritime) serving as Coast Guard, the Provost Service (Prévôté), acting as the Military Police branch of the Gendarmerie. Bastille Day in ParisNational GendarmerieCombined Arms SchoolNational Active Non-Commissioned Officers School As far as the French intelligence units are concerned, the Directorate-General for External Security (Direction générale de la sécurité extérieure) is considered to be a component of the Armed Forces under the authority of the Ministry of Defense. The other, the Central Directorate for Interior Intelligence (Direction centrale du renseignement intérieur) is a division of the National Police Force (Direction générale de la Police Nationale), and therefore reports directly to the Ministry of the Interior. There has been no national conscription since 1997.[176] France has a special military corps, the French Foreign Legion, founded in 1830, which consists of foreign nationals from over 140 countries who are willing to serve in the French Armed Forces and become French citizens after the end of their service period. The only other countries having similar units are Spain (the Spanish Foreign Legion, called Tercio, was founded in 1920) and Luxembourg (foreigners can serve in the National Army provided they speak Luxembourgish). France is a permanent member of the Security Council of the UN, and a recognised nuclear state since 1960. France has signed and ratified the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT)[177] and acceded to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. France's annual military expenditure in 2018 was US$63.8 billion, or 2.3% of its GDP, making it the fifth biggest military spender in the world after the United States, China, Saudi Arabia, and India.[178] French nuclear deterrence, (formerly known as ""Force de Frappe""), relies on complete independence. The current French nuclear force consists of four Triomphant class submarines equipped with submarine-launched ballistic missiles. In addition to the submarine fleet, it is estimated that France has about 60 ASMP medium-range air-to-ground missiles with nuclear warheads,[179] of which around 50 are deployed by the Air and Space Force using the Mirage 2000N long-range nuclear strike aircraft, while around 10 are deployed by the French Navy's Super Étendard Modernisé (SEM) attack aircraft, which operate from the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle. The new Rafale F3 aircraft will gradually replace all Mirage 2000N and SEM in the nuclear strike role with the improved ASMP-A missile with a nuclear warhead. France has major military industries with one of the largest aerospace industries in the world.[180][181] Its industries have produced such equipment as the Rafale fighter, the Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier, the Exocet missile and the Leclerc tank among others. Despite withdrawing from the Eurofighter project, France is actively investing in European joint projects such as the Eurocopter Tiger, multipurpose frigates, the UCAV demonstrator nEUROn and the Airbus A400M. France is a major arms seller,[182][183] with most of its arsenal's designs available for the export market with the notable exception of nuclear-powered devices. France has consistently developed its cybersecurity capabilities, which are regularly ranked as some of the most robust of any nation of the world.[184][185] The Bastille Day military parade held in Paris each 14 July for France's national day, called Bastille Day in English-speaking countries (referred to in France as Fête nationale), is the oldest and largest regular military parade in Europe. Other smaller parades are organised across the country. Government finance See also: Taxation in France The Government of France has run a budget deficit each year since the early 1970s. As of 2016[update], French government debt levels reached 2.2 trillion euros, the equivalent of 96.4% of French GDP.[186] In late 2012, credit rating agencies warned that growing French Government debt levels risked France's AAA credit rating, raising the possibility of a future downgrade and subsequent higher borrowing costs for the French authorities.[187] However, in July 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the French government issued 10-years bonds which had negative interest rates, for the first time in its history.[188] France also possesses in 2020 the fourth-largest gold reserves in the world.[189] Economy Main article: Economy of France La Défense (as seen from the Eiffel Tower) was in 2017 ranked by Ernst & Young as the leading Central business district in continental Europe, and the fourth in the world.[190] A proportional representation of France exports, 2019 France has a mixed economy characterised by a sizeable government involvement, diverse sectors, a skilled labor force, and high innovation. It is a member of the Group of Seven leading industrialized countries and an economic power. For roughly two centuries, the French economy has consistently ranked among the ten largest globally; it is currently the world's ninth largest by purchasing power parity, the seventh largest by nominal GDP, and the second largest in the EU by both metrics.[191] The French economy is highly diversified, though services dominate, representing two thirds of both the workforce and GDP.[192] The industrial sector accounts for a fifth of GDP and a similar proportion of employment; France is the third biggest manufacturing country in Europe, behind Germany and Italy. Less than 2 percent of GDP is generated by the primary sector, namely agriculture;[193] however, France has one of the world's most valuable agricultural sectors, and leads the European Union in agricultural production.[194] In 2018, France was the fifth largest trading nation in the world, and the second-largest in Europe, with the value of exports representing over a fifth of GDP.[195] Its membership in the Eurozone and the broader European Single Market facilitate access to capital, goods, services, and skilled labor.[196] Despite protectionist policies over certain industries, particularly in agriculture, France has generally pioneered free trade and commercial integration in Europe to enhance its economy.[197][198] In 2019 it ranked first in Europe and 13th in the world in Foreign Direct Investment, with European countries and the United States being leading sources.[199] According to the Bank of France, the leading recipients of FDI were manufacturing, real estate, finance, and insurance.[200] The Paris region has the highest concentration of multinational firms in Europe.[201] Under the doctrine of Dirigisme, the government historically played a major role in the economy; policies such as indicative planning and nationalisation are credited for contributing to three decades of unprecedented postwar economic growth known as Trente Glorieuses. At its peak in 1982, the public sector accounted for one-fifth of industrial employment and over four-fifths of the credit market. Beginning in the late 20th century, France loosened regulations and state involvement in the economy, with most leading companies now being privately owned; state ownership now dominates only transportation, defense, and broadcasting.[202] Policies aimed at promoting economic dynamism and privatisation have improved France's economic standing globally: it is among the world's 10 most innovative countries in the 2020 Bloomberg Innovation Index,[203] and the 15th most competitive, according to the 2019 Global Competitiveness Report (up two places from 2018).[204] According to the IMF, France ranked 30th in GDP per capita, with roughly $45,000 per inhabitant. It placed 23rd in the Human Development Index, indicating very high human development. Public corruption is among the lowest in the world, with France ranking 12th on the 2020 Corruption Perceptions Index.[205][206] France is Europe's second largest spender in research and development, at over two percent of GDP; globally, it ranks 12th.[207] Composition of the French economy (GDP) in 2016 by expenditure type France is part of a monetary union, the Eurozone (dark blue), and of the European Single Market (lighter blue). Financial services, banking and the insurance sector are an important part of the economy. Three largest financial institutions cooperatively owned by their customers are located in France.[208] The Paris stock exchange (French: La Bourse de Paris) is one of the oldest in the world, created by Louis XV in 1724.[209] In 2000, it merged with counterparts in Amsterdam and Brussels to form Euronext,[210] which in 2007 merged with the New York stock exchange to form NYSE Euronext, the world's largest stock exchange.[210] Euronext Paris, the French branch of NYSE Euronext, is Europe's second largest stock exchange market, behind the London Stock Exchange.French companies have maintained key positions in the insurance and banking industries: in 2019, AXA the world's third largest insurance company by total nonbanking assets.[211] The leading French banks are BNP Paribas and Crédit Agricole, both ranking among the top 10 largest banks by assets in a 2020 report by S&P Global Market Intelligence;[212] the same source identified Société Générale and Groupe BPCE as the world's 17th and 19th largest banks, respectively.[212] Agriculture Champagne is from the Champagne region in Northeast France. France has historically been a large producer of agricultural products.[213] Extensive tracts of fertile land, the application of modern technology, and EU subsidies have combined to make France the leading agricultural producer and exporter in Europe[214] (representing 20% of the EU's agricultural production)[215] and the world's third biggest exporter of agricultural products.[216] Wheat, poultry, dairy, beef, and pork, as well as internationally recognized processed foods are the primary French agricultural exports. Rosé wines are primarily consumed within the country, but Champagne and Bordeaux wines are major exports, being known worldwide. EU agriculture subsidies to France have decreased in recent years but still amounted to $8 billion in 2007.[217] That same year, France sold 33.4 billion euros of transformed agricultural products.[218] France produces rum via sugar cane-based distilleries almost all of which are located in overseas territories such as Martinique, Guadeloupe and La Réunion. Agriculture is an important sector of France's economy: 3.8% of the active population is employed in agriculture, whereas the total agri-food industry made up 4.2% of French GDP in 2005.[215] Tourism Main article: Tourism in France The Eiffel Tower is the world's most visited paid monument, an icon of both Paris and France. The Château de Marqueyssac, featuring a French formal garden, is one of the Remarkable Gardens of France. With 89 million international tourist arrivals in 2018,[219] France is ranked as the first tourist destination in the world, ahead of Spain (83 million) and the United States (80 million). It is third in income from tourism due to shorter duration of visits.[220] The most popular tourist sites include (annual visitors): Eiffel Tower (6.2 million), Château de Versailles (2.8 million), Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle (2 million), Pont du Gard (1.5 million), Arc de Triomphe (1.2 million), Mont Saint-Michel (1 million), Sainte-Chapelle (683,000), Château du Haut-Kœnigsbourg (549,000), Puy de Dôme (500,000), Musée Picasso (441,000), and Carcassonne (362,000).[221] Paris region France, especially Paris, has some of the world's largest and most renowned museums, including the Louvre, which is the most visited art museum in the world (5.7 million), the Musée d'Orsay (2.1 million), mostly devoted to Impressionism, the Musée de l'Orangerie (1.02 million), which is home to eight large Water Lily murals by Claude Monet, as well as the Centre Georges Pompidou (1.2 million), dedicated to contemporary art. Disneyland Paris is Europe's most popular theme park, with 15 million combined visitors to the resort's Disneyland Park and Walt Disney Studios Park in 2009.[222] French Riviera With more than 10 millions tourists a year, the French Riviera (French: Côte d'Azur), in Southeast France, is the second leading tourist destination in the country, after the Paris region.[223] It benefits from 300 days of sunshine per year, 115 kilometres (71 mi) of coastline and beaches, 18 golf courses, 14 ski resorts and 3,000 restaurants.[224]:31 Each year the Côte d'Azur hosts 50% of the world's superyacht fleet.[224]:66 Châteaux With 6 millions tourists a year, the castles of the Loire Valley (French: châteaux) and the Loire Valley itself are the third leading tourist destination in France;[225][226] this World Heritage site is noteworthy for its architectural heritage, in its historic towns but in particular its castles, such as the Châteaux d'Amboise, de Chambord, d'Ussé, de Villandry, Chenonceau and Montsoreau. The Château de Chantilly, Versailles and Vaux-le-Vicomte, all three located near Paris, are also visitor attractions. Other protected areas France has 37 sites inscribed in UNESCO's World Heritage List and features cities of high cultural interest, beaches and seaside resorts, ski resorts, as well as rural regions that many enjoy for their beauty and tranquillity (green tourism). Small and picturesque French villages are promoted through the association Les Plus Beaux Villages de France (literally ""The Most Beautiful Villages of France""). The ""Remarkable Gardens"" label is a list of the over 200 gardens classified by the Ministry of Culture. This label is intended to protect and promote remarkable gardens and parks. France attracts many religious pilgrims on their way to St. James, or to Lourdes, a town in the Hautes-Pyrénées that hosts several million visitors a year. Energy Further information: Energy in France France derives most of its electricity from nuclear power, the highest percentage in the world. Photograph of the Belleville Nuclear Power Plant Électricité de France (EDF), the main electricity generation and distribution company in France, is also one of the world's largest producers of electricity. In 2018, it produced around 20% of the European Union's electricity,[227] primarily from nuclear power. France is the smallest emitter of carbon dioxide among the G7, due to its heavy investment in nuclear power.[228] As of 2016[update], 72% of the country's electricity is generated by 58 nuclear power plants, the highest proportion in the world.[229][230] In this context, renewable energies are having difficulty taking off. France also uses hydroelectric dams to produce electricity, such as the Eguzon dam, Étang de Soulcem and Lac de Vouglans. Transport Main article: Transport in France A TGV Duplex crossing the Cize–Bolozon viaduct. The train can reach a maximum speed of 360 kilometres per hour (220 mph). France's railway network, which stretches 29,473 kilometres (18,314 mi) as of 2008,[231] is the second most extensive in Western Europe after Germany.[232] It is operated by the SNCF, and high-speed trains include the Thalys, the Eurostar and TGV, which travels at 320 km/h (199 mph).[233] The Eurostar, along with the Eurotunnel Shuttle, connects with the United Kingdom through the Channel Tunnel. Rail connections exist to all other neighboring countries in Europe except Andorra. Intra-urban connections are also well developed, with most major cities having underground and/or tramway services complementing bus services. There are approximately 1,027,183 kilometres (638,262 mi) of serviceable roadway in France, ranking it the most extensive network of the European continent.[234] The Paris region is enveloped with the most dense network of roads and highways, which connect it with virtually all parts of the country. French roads also handle substantial international traffic, connecting with cities in neighboring Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Andorra and Monaco. There is no annual registration fee or road tax; however, usage of the mostly privately owned motorways is through tolls except in the vicinity of large communes. The new car market is dominated by domestic brands such as Renault, Peugeot and Citroën.[235] France possesses the Millau Viaduct, the world's tallest bridge,[236] and has built many important bridges such as the Pont de Normandie. Diesel and gasoline fuelled cars and lorries cause a large part of the country's air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.[237][238] Air France is one of the biggest airlines in the world. There are 464 airports in France.[98] Charles de Gaulle Airport, located in the vicinity of Paris, is the largest and busiest airport in the country, handling the vast majority of popular and commercial traffic and connecting Paris with virtually all major cities across the world. Air France is the national carrier airline, although numerous private airline companies provide domestic and international travel services. There are ten major ports in France, the largest of which is in Marseille,[239] which also is the largest bordering the Mediterranean Sea.[240][241] 12,261 kilometres (7,619 mi) of waterways traverse France including the Canal du Midi, which connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Atlantic Ocean through the Garonne river.[98] Science and technology Main articles: Science and technology in France and List of French inventions and discoveries France is in 2020 the biggest national financial contributor to the European Space Agency,[242] which conceived the Ariane rocket family, launched from French Guiana (Ariane 5 pictured). Since the Middle Ages, France has been a major contributor to scientific and technological achievement. Around the beginning of the 11th century, Pope Sylvester II, born Gerbert d'Aurillac, reintroduced the abacus and armillary sphere, and introduced Arabic numerals and clocks to Northern and Western Europe.[243] The University of Paris, founded in the mid-12th century, is still one of the most important universities in the Western world.[244] In the 17th century, mathematician René Descartes defined a method for the acquisition of scientific knowledge, while Blaise Pascal became famous for his work on probability and fluid mechanics. They were both key figures of the Scientific Revolution, which blossomed in Europe during this period. The Academy of Sciences was founded by Louis XIV to encourage and protect the spirit of French scientific research. It was at the forefront of scientific developments in Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries. It is one of the earliest academies of sciences. The Age of Enlightenment was marked by the work of biologist Buffon and chemist Lavoisier, who discovered the role of oxygen in combustion, while Diderot and D'Alembert published the Encyclopédie, which aimed to give access to ""useful knowledge"" to the people, a knowledge that they can apply to their everyday life.[245] With the Industrial Revolution, the 19th century saw spectacular scientific developments in France with scientists such as Augustin Fresnel, founder of modern optics, Sadi Carnot who laid the foundations of thermodynamics, and Louis Pasteur, a pioneer of microbiology. Other eminent French scientists of the 19th century have their names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower. Famous French scientists of the 20th century include the mathematician and physicist Henri Poincaré; physicists Henri Becquerel, Pierre and Marie Curie, who remain famous for their work on radioactivity; physicist Paul Langevin; and virologist Luc Montagnier, co-discoverer of HIV AIDS. Hand transplantation was developed in Lyon in 1998 by an international team that included Jean-Michel Dubernard, who afterward performed the first successful double hand transplant.[246] Telesurgery was developed by Jacques Marescaux and his team on 7 September 2001 across the Atlantic Ocean (New-York-Strasbourg, Lindbergh Operation).[247] A face transplant was first done on 27 November 2005 by Dr. Bernard Devauchelle.[248][249] The European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble France was the fourth country to achieve nuclear capability[250] and has the third largest nuclear weapons arsenal in the world;[251] it is also a leader in civilian nuclear technology.[252][253][254] France was the third nation, after the Soviet Union and the United States, to launch its own space satellite, and the first to establish a commercial launch service provider, Arianespace. France is a founding member of the European Space Agency (ESA), which is headquartered in Paris, and its leading contributor, providing over a quarter of its budget. ESA's principal spaceport is based in French Guiana, while its main launch vehicle is the French Ariane 5.[255][256][257] France's national space program, CNES, is the oldest, largest, and most active in Europe. France was ranked 12nd in the Global Innovation Index in 2020, up from 16th in 2019.[258][259][260][261] The European Airbus, formed partly from the French group Aérospatiale, is the world's largest airline manufacturer , designs and develops civil and military aircraft as well as communications systems, missiles, space rockets, helicopters, satellites, and related systems. France also hosts major international research instruments such as the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, the Institut Laue–Langevin, and ITER, the latter being the world's biggest mega project. It is also a major member of CERN and owns Minatec, Europe's leading nanotechnology research center. The SNCF, the French national railroad company, has developed the TGV, a high speed train which holds a series of world speed records. The TGV has been the fastest wheeled train in commercial use since reaching a speed of 574.8 km/h (357.2 mph) on 3 April 2007.[262] Western Europe is now serviced by a network of TGV lines. The Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), the state research agency, is the largest research institute in Europe and among the most prominent internationally; it ranked fourth in the 2020 Nature Index for the share of articles published in scientific journals worldwide.[263] According to the same index, France as a whole had the sixth-highest share of articles published in scientific journals.[264] As of 2018[update], 69 French people have been awarded a Nobel Prize[265] and 12 have received the Fields Medal.[266] Demographics Main articles: Demographics of France and French people Population density in France by arrondissement. The main urban areas are visible, notably the Paris (center-north), Lille (north), Marseille (southeast) and Lyon (center-southeast) urban areas. With an estimated May 2021 population of 67.413 million people,[267] France is the 20th most populous country in the world, the third-most populous in Europe (after Russia and Germany), and the second most populous in the European Union (after Germany). France is an outlier among developed countries, particularly in Europe, for its relatively high rate of natural population growth: By birth rates alone, it was responsible for almost all natural population growth in the European Union in 2006.[268] Between 2006 and 2016, France saw the second highest overall increase in population in the EU, and was one of only four EU countries where natural births accounted for most population growth.[269] This was the highest rate since the end of the baby boom in 1973, and coincides with the rise of the total fertility rate from a nadir of 1.7 in 1994 to 2.0 in 2010. As of January 2021[update], the fertility rate declined slightly to 1.84 children per woman, below the replacement rate of 2.1, and considerably below the high of 4.41 in 1800.[270][271][272][273] France's fertility rate and crude birth rate nonetheless remain among the highest in the EU. However, like many developed nations, the French population is aging; the average age is 41.7 years, while about a fifth of French people are 65 or over.[274] Average life expectancy at birth is 82.7 years, the 12th highest in the world. From 2006 to 2011, population growth averaged 0.6 percent per year;[275] since 2011, annual growth has been between 0.4 and 0.5 percent annually.[276] Immigrants are major contributors to this trend; in 2010, 27 percent of newborns in metropolitan France had at least one foreign-born parent and another 24 percent had at least one parent born outside Europe (excluding French overseas territories).[277] Ethnic groups Most French people are of Celtic-Gallic origin, with a significant admixture of Italic (Romans) and Germanic (Franks) groups reflecting centuries of respective migration and settlement.[278] Through the course of the Middle Ages, France incorporated various neighboring ethnic and linguistic groups, as evidenced by Breton elements in the west, Aquitanian in the southwest, Scandinavian in the northwest, Alemannic in the northeast, and Ligurian in the southeast. Large-scale immigration over the last century and a half has led to a more multicultural society; beginning with the French Revolution, and further codified in the French Constitution of 1958, the government is prohibited from collecting data on ethnicity and ancestry; most demographic information is drawn from private sector organisations or academic institutions. In 2004, the Institut Montaigne estimated that within Metropolitan France, 51 million people were White (85% of the population), 6 million were Northwest African (10%), 2 million were Black (3.3%), and 1 million were Asian (1.7%).[279][280] A 2008 poll conducted jointly by INED and the French National Institute of Statistics[281][282] estimated that the largest ancestry groups were Italian (5 million), followed by Northwest African (3-6 million),[283][284][285] Sub-Saharan African (2.5 million), Armenian (500,000), and Turkish (200,000).[286] There are also sizable minorities of other European ethnic groups, namely Spanish, Portuguese, Polish, and Greek.[283][287][288] France has a significant Gitan (Romani) population, numbering between 20,000 and 400,000;[289] many foreign Roma are expelled back to Bulgaria and Romania frequently.[290] Immigration It is currently estimated that 40% of the French population is descended at least partially from the different waves of immigration since the early 20th century;[291] between 1921 and 1935 alone, about 1.1 million net immigrants came to France.[292] The next largest wave came in the 1960s, when around 1.6 million pieds noirs returned to France following the independence of its Northwest African possessions, Algeria and Morocco.[293][294] They were joined by numerous former colonial subjects from North and West Africa, as well as numerous European immigrants from Spain and Portugal. France remains a major destination for immigrants, accepting about 200,000 legal immigrants annually.[295] In 2005, it was Western Europe's leading recipient of asylum seekers, with an estimated 50,000 applications (albeit 15% decrease from 2004).[296] In 2010, France received about 48,100 asylum applications—placing it among the top five asylum recipients in the world[297] and in subsequent years it saw the number of applications increase, ultimately doubling to 100,412 in 2017.[298] The European Union allows free movement between the member states, although France established controls to curb Eastern European migration,[citation needed] and immigration remains a contentious political issue. In 2008, the INSEE (National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies) estimated that the total number of foreign-born immigrants was around 5 million (8% of the population), while their French-born descendants numbered 6.5 million, or 11% of the population. Thus, nearly a fifth of the country's population were either first or second-generation immigrants, of which more than 5 million were of European origin and 4 million of Maghrebi ancestry.[299][300][301] In 2008, France granted citizenship to 137,000 persons, mostly from Morocco, Algeria and Turkey.[302] In 2014, an INSEE reported doubling of the number of Spanish immigrants, Portuguese and Italians in France between 2009 and 2012. According to the French Institute, this increase resulting from the financial crisis that hit several European countries in that period, has pushed up the number of Europeans installed in France.[303] Statistics on Spanish immigrants in France show a growth of 107 percent between 2009 and 2012, i.e. in this period went from 5,300 to 11,000 people.[303] Of the total of 229,000 foreigners who were in France in 2012, nearly 8% were Portuguese, 5% British, 5% Spanish, 4% Italians, 4% Germans, 3% Romanians, and 3% Belgians.[303] Major cities See also: Urban area (France) and Urban unit France is a highly urbanized country, with its largest cities (in terms of metropolitan area population in 2016[304]) being Paris (12,568,755 inh.), Lyon (2,310,850), Marseille (1,756,296), Toulouse (1,345,343), Bordeaux (1,232,550), Lille (1,187,824), Nice (1,006,402), Nantes (961,521), Strasbourg (785,839) and Rennes (727,357). (Note: There are significant differences between the metropolitan population figures just cited and those in the following table, which indicates the population of the communes).

Since 1635, the Académie française has been France's official authority on the French language, although its recommendations carry no legal weight. There are also regional languages spoken in France, such as Occitan, Breton, Catalan, Flemish (Dutch dialect), Alsatian (German dialect), Basque, and Corsican. Italian was the official language of Corsica until 9 May 1859.[306] The Government of France does not regulate the choice of language in publications by individuals but the use of French is required by law in commercial and workplace communications. In addition to mandating the use of French in the territory of the Republic, the French government tries to promote French in the European Union and globally through institutions such as the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie. The perceived threat from anglicisation has prompted efforts to safeguard the position of the French language in France. Besides French, there exist 77 vernacular minority languages of France, eight spoken in French metropolitan territory and 69 in the French overseas territories. From the 17th to the mid-20th century, French served as the pre-eminent international language of diplomacy and international affairs as well as a lingua franca among the educated classes of Europe.[307] The dominant position of French language in international affairs was overtaken by English, since the emergence of the United States as a major power.[59][308][309] For most of the time in which French served as an international lingua franca, it was not the native language of most Frenchmen: a report in 1794 conducted by Henri Grégoire found that of the country's 25 million people, only three million spoke French natively; the rest spoke one of the country's many regional languages, such as Alsatian, Breton or Occitan.[310] Through the expansion of public education, in which French was the sole language of instruction, as well as other factors such as increased urbanisation and the rise of mass communication, French gradually came to be adopted by virtually the entire population, a process not completed until the 20th century. As a result of France's extensive colonial ambitions between the 17th and 20th centuries, French was introduced to the Americas, Africa, Polynesia, South-East Asia, as well as the Caribbean. French is the second most studied foreign language in the world after English,[311] and is a lingua franca in some regions, notably in Africa. The legacy of French as a living language outside Europe is mixed: it is nearly extinct in some former French colonies (The Levant, South and Southeast Asia), while creoles and pidgins based on French have emerged in the French departments in the West Indies and the South Pacific (French Polynesia). On the other hand, many former French colonies have adopted French as an official language, and the total number of French speakers is increasing, especially in Africa. It is estimated that between 300 million[312] and 500 million[313] people worldwide can speak French, either as a mother tongue or a second language. According to the 2007 Adult Education survey, part of a project by the European Union and carried in France by the INSEE and based on a sample of 15,350 persons, French was the native language of 87.2% of the total population, or roughly 55.81 million people, followed by Arabic (3.6%, 2.3 million), Portuguese (1.5%, 960,000), Spanish (1.2%, 770,000) and Italian (1.0%, 640,000). Native speakers of other languages made up the remaining 5.2% of the population.[314] Religion Main article: Religion in France Notre-Dame de Reims is the Roman Catholic cathedral where the Kings of France were crowned until 1825.[XIV] France is a secular country in which freedom of religion is a constitutional right. French religious policy is based on the concept of laïcité, a strict separation of church and state under which public life is kept completely secular. According to a survey held in 2016 by Institut Montaigne and Institut français d'opinion publique (IFOP), 51.1% of the total population of France was Christian, 39.6% had no religion (atheism or agnosticism), 5.6% were Muslims, 2.5% were followers of other faiths, and the remaining 0.4% were undecided about their faith.[315] Estimates of the number of Muslims in France vary widely. In 2003, the French Ministry of the Interior estimated the total number of people of Muslim background to be between 5 and 6 million (8–10%).[316][317] The current Jewish community in France is the largest in Europe and the third-largest in the world after Israel and the United States, ranging between 480,000 and 600,000, about 0.8% of the population as of 2016.[315] Catholicism has been the predominant religion in France for more than a millennium, though it is not as actively practised today as it was. Among the 47,000 religious buildings in France, 94% are Roman Catholic.[318] During the French Revolution, activists conducted a brutal campaign of de-Christianisation, ending the Catholic Church as the state religion. In some cases clergy and churches were attacked, with iconoclasm stripping the churches of statues and ornaments. After alternating between royal and secular republican governments during the 19th century, in 1905 France passed the 1905 law on the Separation of the Churches and the State, which established the principle of laïcité.[319] To this day, the government is prohibited from recognizing any specific right to a religious community (except for legacy statutes like those of military chaplains and the local law in Alsace-Moselle). It recognizes religious organisations according to formal legal criteria that do not address religious doctrine. Conversely, religious organisations are expected to refrain from intervening in policy-making.[320] Certain groups, such as Scientology, Children of God, the Unification Church, and the Order of the Solar Temple are considered cults (""sectes"" in French), and therefore do not have the same status as recognized religions in France.[321] Secte is considered a pejorative term in France.[322] Health Main article: Health in France The Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, a teaching hospital in Paris, is one of Europe's largest hospitals.[323] The French health care system is one of universal health care largely financed by government national health insurance. In its 2000 assessment of world health care systems, the World Health Organization found that France provided the ""close to best overall health care"" in the world.[324] The French healthcare system was ranked first worldwide by the World Health Organization in 1997.[325][326] In 2011, France spent 11.6% of GDP on health care, or US$4,086 per capita,[327] a figure much higher than the average spent by countries in Europe but less than in the United States. Approximately 77% of health expenditures are covered by government funded agencies.[328] Care is generally free for people affected by chronic diseases (affections de longues durées) such as cancer, AIDS or cystic fibrosis. Average life expectancy at birth is 78 years for men and 85 years for women, one of the highest of the European Union and the World.[329][330] There are 3.22 physicians for every 1000 inhabitants in France,[331] and average health care spending per capita was US$4,719 in 2008.[332] As of 2007[update], approximately 140,000 inhabitants (0.4%) of France are living with HIV/AIDS.[98] Even if the French have the reputation of being one of the thinnest people in developed countries,[333][334][335][336][337] France—like other rich countries—faces an increasing and recent epidemic of obesity, due mostly to the replacement in French eating habits of traditional healthy French cuisine by junk food.[338][333][334][339] The French obesity rate is still far below that of the United States—currently equal to American rate in the 1970s—and is still the lowest of Europe.[334][336][339] Authorities now regard obesity as one of the main public health issues and fight it fiercely.[340] Rates of childhood obesity are slowing in France, while continuing to grow in other countries.[341] Education Main article: Education in France The École normale supérieure (ENS) in Paris, established in the end of the 18th century, produces more Nobel Prize laureates per capita than any other institution in the world.[342] In 1802, Napoleon created the lycée, the second and final stage of secondary education that prepares students for higher education studies or a profession.[343] Nevertheless, Jules Ferry is considered the father of the French modern school, leading reforms in the late 19th century that established free, secular, and compulsory education (currently mandatory until the age of 16).[344][345] French education is centralized and divided into three stages: Primary, secondary, and higher education. The Programme for International Student Assessment, coordinated by the OECD, ranked France's education as below OECD average in 2018.[346] Primary and secondary education are predominantly public, run by the Ministry of National Education. While training and remuneration of teachers and the curriculum are the responsibility of the state centrally, the management of primary and secondary schools is overseen by local authorities. Primary education comprises two phases, nursery school (école maternelle) and elementary school (école élémentaire). Nursery school aims to stimulate the minds of very young children and promote their socialization and development of a basic grasp of language and number. Around the age of six, children transfer to elementary school, whose primary objectives are learning about writing, arithmetic and citizenship. Secondary education also consists of two phases. The first is delivered through colleges (collège) and leads to the national certificate (Diplôme national du brevet). The second is offered in high schools (lycée) and finishes in national exams leading to a baccalaureate (baccalauréat, available in professional, technical or general flavors) or certificate of professional competence (certificat d'aptitude professionelle). Higher education is divided between public universities and the prestigious and selective Grandes écoles, such as Sciences Po Paris for Political studies, HEC Paris for Economics, Polytechnique, the École des hautes études en sciences sociales for Social studies and the École nationale supérieure des mines de Paris that produce high-profile engineers, or the École nationale d'administration for careers in the Grands Corps of the state. The Grandes écoles have been criticized for alleged elitism, producing many if not most of France's high-ranking civil servants, CEOs, and politicians.[347] Culture Main article: Culture of France Eugène Delacroix's Liberty Leading the People (1830) portrays the July Revolution using the stylistic views of Romanticism. Since Liberty is part of the motto ""Liberté, égalité, fraternité"", as the French put it, this painting has become the primary symbol of the French Republic. France has been a centre of Western cultural development for centuries. Many French artists have been among the most renowned of their time; France is still recognised in the world for its rich cultural tradition.[348] The successive political regimes have always promoted artistic creation. The creation of the Ministry of Culture in 1959 helped preserve the cultural heritage of the country and make it available to the public. The Ministry of Culture has been very active since its creation, granting subsidies to artists, promoting French culture in the world, supporting festivals and cultural events, protecting historical monuments. The French government also succeeded in maintaining a cultural exception to defend audiovisual products made in the country.[349] France receives the highest number of tourists per year, largely thanks to the numerous cultural establishments and historical buildings implanted all over the territory. It counts 1,200 museums welcoming more than 50 million people annually.[350] The most important cultural sites are run by the government, for instance through the public agency Centre des monuments nationaux, which is responsible for approximately 85 national historical monuments. The 43,180 buildings protected as historical monuments include mainly residences (many castles) and religious buildings (cathedrals, basilicas, churches), but also statues, memorials and gardens. The UNESCO inscribed 45 sites in France on the World Heritage List.[351] Art Main article: French art The Louvre Museum, widely recognized as one of the finest art museums in the world, was in 2019 both the largest and the most-visited museum in the world.[352] The origins of French art were very much influenced by Flemish art and by Italian art at the time of the Renaissance. Jean Fouquet, the most famous medieval French painter, is said to have been the first to travel to Italy and experience the Early Renaissance at first hand. The Renaissance painting School of Fontainebleau was directly inspired by Italian painters such as Primaticcio and Rosso Fiorentino, who both worked in France. Two of the most famous French artists of the time of Baroque era, Nicolas Poussin and Claude Lorrain, lived in Italy. Claude Monet, founder of the Impressionist movement The 17th century was the period when French painting became prominent and individualised itself through classicism. Prime Minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert founded in 1648 the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture under Louis XIV to protect these artists; in 1666 he also created the still-active French Academy in Rome to have direct relations with Italian artists. French artists developed the rococo style in the 18th century, as a more intimate imitation of old baroque style, the works of the court-endorsed artists Antoine Watteau, François Boucher and Jean-Honoré Fragonard being the most representative in the country. The French Revolution brought great changes, as Napoleon favoured artists of neoclassic style such as Jacques-Louis David and the highly influential Académie des Beaux-Arts defined the style known as Academism. At this time France had become a centre of artistic creation, the first half of the 19th century being dominated by two successive movements, at first Romanticism with Théodore Géricault and Eugène Delacroix, then Realism with Camille Corot, Gustave Courbet and Jean-François Millet, a style that eventually evolved into Naturalism. In the second part of the 19th century, France's influence over painting became even more important, with the development of new styles of painting such as Impressionism and Symbolism. The most famous impressionist painters of the period were Camille Pissarro, Édouard Manet, Edgar Degas, Claude Monet and Auguste Renoir.[353] The second generation of impressionist-style painters, Paul Cézanne, Paul Gauguin, Toulouse-Lautrec and Georges Seurat, were also at the avant-garde of artistic evolutions,[354] as well as the fauvist artists Henri Matisse, André Derain and Maurice de Vlaminck.[355][356] At the beginning of the 20th century, Cubism was developed by Georges Braque and the Spanish painter Pablo Picasso, living in Paris. Other foreign artists also settled and worked in or near Paris, such as Vincent van Gogh, Marc Chagall, Amedeo Modigliani and Wassily Kandinsky. Le Penseur by Auguste Rodin (1902), Musée Rodin, Paris Many museums in France are entirely or partly devoted to sculptures and painting works. A huge collection of old masterpieces created before or during the 18th century are displayed in the state-owned Musée du Louvre, such as the Mona Lisa, also known as ""La Joconde"". While the Louvre Palace has been for a long time a museum, the Musée d'Orsay was inaugurated in 1986 in the old railway station Gare d'Orsay, in a major reorganisation of national art collections, to gather French paintings from the second part of the 19th century (mainly Impressionism and Fauvism movements).[357][358] The musée d'Orsay was voted in 2018 the best museum in the world.[359] Modern works are presented in the Musée National d'Art Moderne, which moved in 1976 to the Centre Georges Pompidou. These three state-owned museums welcome close to 17 million people a year.[360] Other national museums hosting paintings include the Grand Palais (1.3 million visitors in 2008), but there are also many museums owned by cities, the most visited being the Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris (0.8 million entries in 2008), which hosts contemporary works.[360] Outside Paris, all the large cities have a Museum of Fine Arts with a section dedicated to European and French painting. Some of the finest collections are in Lyon, Lille, Rouen, Dijon, Rennes and Grenoble. Architecture Main article: French architecture Saint Louis's Sainte-Chapelle represents the French impact on religious architecture. During the Middle Ages, many fortified castles were built by feudal nobles to mark their powers. Some French castles that survived are Chinon, Château d'Angers, the massive Château de Vincennes and the so-called Cathar castles. During this era, France had been using Romanesque architecture like most of Western Europe. Some of the greatest examples of Romanesque churches in France are the Saint Sernin Basilica in Toulouse, the largest romanesque church in Europe,[361] and the remains of the Cluniac Abbey. The Gothic architecture, originally named Opus Francigenum meaning ""French work"",[362] was born in Île-de-France and was the first French style of architecture to be copied in all Europe.[363] Northern France is the home of some of the most important Gothic cathedrals and basilicas, the first of these being the Saint Denis Basilica (used as the royal necropolis); other important French Gothic cathedrals are Notre-Dame de Chartres and Notre-Dame d'Amiens. The kings were crowned in another important Gothic church: Notre-Dame de Reims.[364] Aside from churches, Gothic Architecture had been used for many religious palaces, the most important one being the Palais des Papes in Avignon. The final victory in the Hundred Years' War marked an important stage in the evolution of French architecture. It was the time of the French Renaissance and several artists from Italy were invited to the French court; many residential palaces were built in the Loire Valley, from 1450 with as a first reference the Château de Montsoreau.[365] Such residential castles were the Château de Chambord, the Château de Chenonceau, or the Château d'Amboise. Following the renaissance and the end of the Middle Ages, Baroque architecture replaced the traditional Gothic style. However, in France, baroque architecture found a greater success in the secular domain than in a religious one.[366] In the secular domain, the Palace of Versailles has many baroque features. Jules Hardouin Mansart, who designed the extensions to Versailles, was one of the most influential French architect of the baroque era; he is famous for his dome at Les Invalides.[367] Some of the most impressive provincial baroque architecture is found in places that were not yet French such as the Place Stanislas in Nancy. On the military architectural side, Vauban designed some of the most efficient fortresses in Europe and became an influential military architect; as a result, imitations of his works can be found all over Europe, the Americas, Russia and Turkey.[368][369] Place de la Bourse in Bordeaux, an example of French baroque architecture After the Revolution, the Republicans favoured Neoclassicism although it was introduced in France prior to the revolution with such buildings as the Parisian Pantheon or the Capitole de Toulouse. Built during the first French Empire, the Arc de Triomphe and Sainte Marie-Madeleine represent the best example of Empire style architecture.[370] Under Napoleon III, a new wave of urbanism and architecture was given birth; extravagant buildings such as the neo-baroque Palais Garnier were built. The urban planning of the time was very organised and rigorous; for example, Haussmann's renovation of Paris. The architecture associated to this era is named Second Empire in English, the term being taken from the Second French Empire. At this time there was a strong Gothic resurgence across Europe and in France; the associated architect was Eugène Viollet-le-Duc. In the late 19th century, Gustave Eiffel designed many bridges, such as Garabit viaduct, and remains one of the most influential bridge designers of his time, although he is best remembered for the iconic Eiffel Tower. The Capitole de Toulouse hosts Toulouse City Hall. In the 20th century, French-Swiss architect Le Corbusier designed several buildings in France. More recently, French architects have combined both modern and old architectural styles. The Louvre Pyramid is an example of modern architecture added to an older building. The most difficult buildings to integrate within French cities are skyscrapers, as they are visible from afar. For instance, in Paris, since 1977, new buildings had to be under 37 metres (121 ft).[371] France's largest financial district is La Defense, where a significant number of skyscrapers are located.[372] Other massive buildings that are a challenge to integrate into their environment are large bridges; an example of the way this has been done is the Millau Viaduct. Some famous modern French architects include Jean Nouvel, Dominique Perrault, Christian de Portzamparc or Paul Andreu. Literature Main article: French literature The earliest French literature dates from the Middle Ages, when what is now known as modern France did not have a single, uniform language. There were several languages and dialects, and writers used their own spelling and grammar. Some authors of French medieval texts are unknown, such as Tristan and Iseult and Lancelot-Grail. Other authors are known, for example Chrétien de Troyes and Duke William IX of Aquitaine, who wrote in Occitan. Much medieval French poetry and literature were inspired by the legends of the Matter of France, such as The Song of Roland and the various chansons de geste. The Roman de Renart, written in 1175 by Perrout de Saint Cloude, tells the story of the medieval character Reynard ('the Fox') and is another example of early French writing. An important 16th-century writer was François Rabelais, whose novel Gargantua and Pantagruel has remained famous and appreciated until now. Michel de Montaigne was the other major figure of the French literature during that century. His most famous work, Essais, created the literary genre of the essay.[373] French poetry during that century was embodied by Pierre de Ronsard and Joachim du Bellay. Both writers founded the La Pléiade literary movement. During the 17th century, Madame de La Fayette published anonymously La Princesse de Clèves, a novel that is considered to be one of the first psychological novels of all time.[374] Jean de La Fontaine is one of the most famous fabulists of that time, as he wrote hundreds of fables, some being far more famous than others, such as The Ant and the Grasshopper. Generations of French pupils had to learn his fables, that were seen as helping teaching wisdom and common sense to the young people. Some of his verses have entered the popular language to become proverbs, such as ""À l'œuvre, on connaît l'artisan.""[A workman is known by his chips].[375] French literary figures. Clockwise from top left: Molière is the most played author in the Comédie-Française;[376] Victor Hugo is one of the most important French novelists and poets; 19th-century poet, writer and translator Charles Baudelaire; 20th-century philosopher and novelist Jean-Paul Sartre Jean Racine, whose incredible mastery of the alexandrine and of the French language has been praised for centuries, created plays such as Phèdre or Britannicus. He is, along with Pierre Corneille (Le Cid) and Molière, considered one of the three great dramatists of France's golden age. Molière, who is deemed to be one of the greatest masters of comedy of the Western literature,[377] wrote dozens of plays, including Le Misanthrope, L'Avare, Le Malade imaginaire, as well as Le Bourgeois gentilhomme. His plays have been so popular around the world that French language is sometimes dubbed as ""the language of Molière"" (la langue de Molière),[378] just like English is considered ""the language of Shakespeare"". French literature and poetry flourished even more in the 18th and 19th centuries. Denis Diderot's best-known works are Jacques the Fatalist and Rameau's Nephew. He is however best known for being the main redactor of the Encyclopédie, whose aim was to sum up all the knowledge of his century (in fields such as arts, sciences, languages, and philosophy) and to present them to the people, to fight ignorance and obscurantism. During that same century, Charles Perrault was a prolific writer of famous children's fairy tales including Puss in Boots, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty and Bluebeard. At the start of the 19th century, symbolist poetry was an important movement in French literature, with poets such as Charles Baudelaire, Paul Verlaine and Stéphane Mallarmé.[379] The 19th century saw the writings of many renowned French authors. Victor Hugo is sometimes seen as ""the greatest French writer of all time""[380] for excelling in all literary genres. The preface of his play Cromwell is considered to be the manifesto of the Romantic movement. Les Contemplations and La Légende des siècles are considered ""poetic masterpieces"",[381] Hugo's verse having been compared to that of Shakespeare, Dante and Homer.[381] His novel Les Misérables is widely seen as one of the greatest novel ever written[382] and The Hunchback of Notre Dame has remained immensely popular. Other major authors of that century include Alexandre Dumas (The Three Musketeers and The Count of Monte-Cristo), Jules Verne (Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea), Émile Zola (Les Rougon-Macquart), Honoré de Balzac (La Comédie humaine), Guy de Maupassant, Théophile Gautier and Stendhal (The Red and the Black, The Charterhouse of Parma), whose works are among the most well known in France and the world. The Prix Goncourt is a French literary prize first awarded in 1903.[383] Important writers of the 20th century include Marcel Proust, Louis-Ferdinand Céline, Albert Camus, and Jean-Paul Sartre. Antoine de Saint Exupéry wrote Little Prince, which has remained popular for decades with children and adults around the world.[384] As of 2014[update], French authors had more Literature Nobel Prizes than those of any other nation.[385] The first Nobel Prize in Literature was a French author, while France's latest Nobel prize in literature is Patrick Modiano, who was awarded the prize in 2014.[385] Jean-Paul Sartre was also the first nominee in the committee's history to refuse the prize in 1964.[385] Philosophy Main article: French philosophy Medieval philosophy was dominated by Scholasticism until the emergence of Humanism in the Renaissance. Modern philosophy began in France in the 17th century with the philosophy of René Descartes, Blaise Pascal and Nicolas Malebranche. Descartes was the first Western philosopher since ancient times to attempt to build a philosophical system from the ground up rather than building on the work of predecessors.""[386][387] His Meditations on First Philosophy changed the primary object of philosophical thought and raised some of the most fundamental problems for foreigners such as Spinoza, Leibniz, Hume, Berkeley, and Kant. René Descartes, founder of modern Western philosophy[388] French philosophers produced some of the most important political works of the Age of Enlightenment. In The Spirit of the Laws, Baron de Montesquieu theorised the principle of separation of powers, which has been implemented in all liberal democracies since it was first applied in the United States. Voltaire came to embody the Enlightenment with his defence of civil liberties, such as the right to a free trial and freedom of religion. 19th-century French thought was targeted at responding to the social malaise following the French Revolution. Rationalist philosophers such as Victor Cousin and Auguste Comte, who called for a new social doctrine, were opposed by reactionary thinkers such as Joseph de Maistre, Louis de Bonald and Félicité Robert de Lamennais, who blamed the rationalist rejection of traditional order. De Maistre, together with the Englishman Edmund Burke, was one of the founders of European conservatism. Comte was the founder of positivism, which Émile Durkheim reformulated as a basis for social research. In the 20th century, partly as a reaction to the perceived excesses of positivism, French spiritualism thrived with thinkers such as Henri Bergson and it influenced American pragmatism and Whitehead's version of process philosophy. Meanwhile, French epistemology became a prominent school of thought with Jules Henri Poincaré, Gaston Bachelard, Jean Cavaillès and Jules Vuillemin. Influenced by German phenomenology and existentialism, the philosophy of Jean-Paul Sartre gained a strong influence after World War II, and late-20th-century-France became the cradle of postmodern philosophy with Jean-François Lyotard, Jean Baudrillard, Jacques Derrida and Michel Foucault. Music Main article: Music of France Claude Debussy France has a long and varied musical history. It experienced a golden age in the 17th century thanks to Louis XIV, who employed a number of talented musicians and composers in the royal court. The most renowned composers of this period include Marc-Antoine Charpentier, François Couperin, Michel-Richard Delalande, Jean-Baptiste Lully and Marin Marais, all of them composers at the court. After the death of the ""Roi Soleil"", French musical creation lost dynamism, but in the next century the music of Jean-Philippe Rameau reached some prestige, and today he is still one of the most renowned French composers. Rameau became the dominant composer of French opera and the leading French composer for the harpsichord.[389][full citation needed] French composers played an important role during the music of the 19th and early 20th century, which is considered to be the Romantic music era. Romantic music emphasised a surrender to nature, a fascination with the past and the supernatural, the exploration of unusual, strange and surprising sounds, and a focus on national identity. This period was also a golden age for operas. French composers from the Romantic era included: Hector Berlioz (best known for his Symphonie fantastique), Georges Bizet (best known for Carmen, which has become one of the most popular and frequently performed operas), Gabriel Fauré (best known for his Pavane, Requiem, and nocturnes), Charles Gounod (best known for his Ave Maria and his opera Faust), Jacques Offenbach (best known for his 100 operettas of the 1850s–1870s and his uncompleted opera The Tales of Hoffmann), Édouard Lalo (best known for his Symphonie espagnole for violin and orchestra and his Cello Concerto in D minor), Jules Massenet (best known for his operas, of which he wrote more than thirty, the most frequently staged are Manon (1884) and Werther (1892)) and Camille Saint-Saëns (he has many frequently-performed works, including The Carnival of the Animals, Danse macabre, Samson and Delilah (Opera), Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso and his Symphony No. 3). Later came precursors of modern classical music. Érik Satie was a key member of the early-20th-century Parisian avant-garde, best known for his Gymnopédies. Francis Poulenc's best known works are his piano suite Trois mouvements perpétuels (1919), the ballet Les biches (1923), the Concert champêtre (1928) for harpsichord and orchestra, the opera Dialogues des Carmélites (1957) and the Gloria (1959) for soprano, choir and orchestra. Maurice Ravel and Claude Debussy are the most prominent figures associated with Impressionist music. Debussy was among the most influential composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and his use of non-traditional scales and chromaticism influenced many composers who followed.[390] Debussy's music is noted for its sensory content and frequent usage of atonality. The two composers invented new musical forms[391][392][393][394] and new sounds. Ravel's piano compositions, such as Jeux d'eau, Miroirs, Le tombeau de Couperin and Gaspard de la nuit, demand considerable virtuosity. His mastery of orchestration is evident in the Rapsodie espagnole, Daphnis et Chloé, his arrangement of Modest Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition and his orchestral work Boléro (1928). More recently, the middle of the 20th century, Maurice Ohana, Pierre Schaeffer and Pierre Boulez contributed to the evolutions of contemporary classical music.[395] Serge Gainsbourg, one of the world's most influential popular musicians French music then followed the rapid emergence of pop and rock music at the middle of the 20th century. Although English-speaking creations achieved popularity in the country, French pop music, known as chanson française, has also remained very popular. Among the most important French artists of the century are Édith Piaf, Georges Brassens, Léo Ferré, Charles Aznavour and Serge Gainsbourg.[396] Although there are very few rock bands in France compared to English-speaking countries,[397] bands such as Noir Désir, Mano Negra, Niagara, Les Rita Mitsouko and more recently Superbus, Phoenix and Gojira,[398] or Shaka Ponk, have reached worldwide popularity. Daft Punk, pioneers of the French house movement Other French artists with international careers have been popular in several countries, most notably female singers Dalida, Mireille Mathieu, Mylène Farmer,[398] Alizée and Nolwenn Leroy,[399] electronic music pioneers Jean-Michel Jarre, Laurent Garnier and Bob Sinclar, later Martin Solveig and David Guetta. In the 1990s and 2000s (decade), electronic duos Daft Punk, Justice and Air also reached worldwide popularity and contributed to the reputation of modern electronic music in the world.[398][400][401] Among current musical events and institutions in France, many are dedicated to classical music and operas. The most prestigious institutions are the state-owned Paris National Opera (with its two sites Palais Garnier and Opéra Bastille), the Opéra National de Lyon, the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris, the Théâtre du Capitole in Toulouse and the Grand Théâtre de Bordeaux. As for music festivals, there are several events organised, the most popular being Eurockéennes (a word play which sounds in French as ""European""), Solidays and Rock en Seine. The Fête de la Musique, imitated by many foreign cities, was first launched by the French Government in 1982.[402][403] Major music halls and venues in France include Le Zénith sites present in many cities and other places in Paris (Paris Olympia, Théâtre Mogador, Élysée Montmartre). Cinema Main article: Cinema of France A Palme d'Or from the Cannes Film Festival, one of the ""Big Three"" film festivals alongside the Venice Film Festival and Berlin International Film Festival[404][405][406] Louis de Funès, often called ""France's favourite actor"", has played over 130 roles in film and over 100 on stage.[407] France has historical and strong links with cinema, with two Frenchmen, Auguste and Louis Lumière (known as the Lumière Brothers) credited with creating cinema in 1895.[408] The world's first female filmmaker, Alice Guy-Blaché, was also from France.[409] Several important cinematic movements, including the late 1950s and 1960s Nouvelle Vague, began in the country. It is noted for having a strong film industry, due in part to protections afforded by the Government of France. France remains a leader in filmmaking, as of 2015[update] producing more films than any other European country.[410][411] The nation also hosts the Cannes Festival, one of the most important and famous film festivals in the world.[412][413] Apart from its strong and innovative film tradition, France has also been a gathering spot for artists from across Europe and the world. For this reason, French cinema is sometimes intertwined with the cinema of foreign nations. Directors from nations such as Poland (Roman Polanski, Krzysztof Kieślowski, Andrzej Żuławski), Argentina (Gaspar Noé, Edgardo Cozarinsky), Russia (Alexandre Alexeieff, Anatole Litvak), Austria (Michael Haneke) and Georgia (Géla Babluani, Otar Iosseliani) are prominent in the ranks of French cinema. Conversely, French directors have had prolific and influential careers in other countries, such as Luc Besson, Jacques Tourneur or Francis Veber in the United States. Although the French film market is dominated by Hollywood, France is the only nation in the world where American films make up the smallest share of total film revenues, at 50%, compared with 77% in Germany and 69% in Japan.[414] French films account for 35% of the total film revenues of France, which is the highest percentage of national film revenues in the developed world outside the United States, compared to 14% in Spain and 8% in the UK.[414] France is in 2013 the 2nd exporter of films in the world after the United States.[415] France historically was the cultural center of the world,[307] although its dominant position has been surpassed by the United States. Today, France takes steps in protecting and promoting its culture, becoming a leading advocate of the cultural exception.[416] The nation succeeded in convincing all EU members to refuse to include culture and audiovisuals in the list of liberalised sectors of the WTO in 1993.[417] Moreover, this decision was confirmed in a voting in the UNESCO in 2005: the principle of ""cultural exception"" won an overwhelming victory with 198 countries voting for it and only 2 countries, the United States and Israel, voting against.[418] Fashion Main article: French fashion Chanel's headquarters on the Place Vendôme, Paris Fashion has been an important industry and cultural export of France since the 17th century, and modern ""haute couture"" originated in Paris in the 1860s. Today, Paris, along with London, Milan, and New York City, is considered one of the world's fashion capitals, and the city is home or headquarters to many of the premier fashion houses. The expression Haute couture is, in France, a legally protected name, guaranteeing certain quality standards. The association of France with fashion and style (French: la mode) dates largely to the reign of Louis XIV[419] when the luxury goods industries in France came increasingly under royal control and the French royal court became, arguably, the arbiter of taste and style in Europe. But France renewed its dominance of the high fashion (French: couture or haute couture) industry in the years 1860–1960 through the establishing of the great couturier houses such as Chanel, Dior, and Givenchy. The French perfume industry is world leader in its sector and is centered on the town of Grasse.[420] In the 1960s, the elitist ""Haute couture"" came under criticism from France's youth culture. In 1966, the designer Yves Saint Laurent broke with established Haute Couture norms by launching a prêt-à-porter (""ready to wear"") line and expanding French fashion into mass manufacturing. With a greater focus on marketing and manufacturing, new trends were established by Sonia Rykiel, Thierry Mugler, Claude Montana, Jean-Paul Gaultier and Christian Lacroix in the 1970s and 1980s. The 1990s saw a conglomeration of many French couture houses under luxury giants and multinationals such as LVMH. According to 2017 data compiled by Deloitte, Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessey (LVMH), a French brand, is the largest luxury company in the world by sales, selling more than twice the amount of its nearest competitor.[421] Moreover, France also possesses 3 of the top 10 luxury goods companies by sales (LVMH, Kering SA, L'Oréal), more than any other country in the world.[421] Media Main article: Telecommunications in France The Parisian headquarters of Agence France-Presse, one of the world's oldest and leading news agencies[422] Best-selling daily national newspapers in France are Le Parisien Aujourd'hui en France (with 460,000 sold daily), Le Monde and Le Figaro, with around 300,000 copies sold daily, but also L'Équipe, dedicated to sports coverage.[423] In the past years, free dailies made a breakthrough, with Metro, 20 Minutes and Direct Plus distributed at more than 650,000 copies respectively.[424] However, the widest circulations are reached by regional daily Ouest France with more than 750,000 copies sold, and the 50 other regional papers have also high sales.[425][426] The sector of weekly magazines is stronger and diversified with more than 400 specialized weekly magazines published in the country.[427] The most influential news magazines are the left-wing Le Nouvel Observateur, centrist L'Express and right-wing Le Point (more than 400.000 copies),[428] but the highest circulation for weeklies is reached by TV magazines and by women's magazines, among them Marie Claire and ELLE, which have foreign versions. Influential weeklies also include investigative and satirical papers Le Canard Enchaîné and Charlie Hebdo, as well as Paris Match. Like in most industrialized nations, the print media have been affected by a severe crisis in the past decade. In 2008, the government launched a major initiative to help the sector reform and become financially independent,[429][430] but in 2009 it had to give 600,000 euros to help the print media cope with the economic crisis, in addition to existing subsidies.[431] Le Figaro was founded in 1826; many of France's most prominent authors have written in its columns over the decades, and it is still considered a newspaper of record.[432] In 1974, after years of centralised monopoly on radio and television, the governmental agency ORTF was split into several national institutions, but the three already-existing TV channels and four national radio stations[433][434] remained under state-control. It was only in 1981 that the government allowed free broadcasting in the territory, ending state monopoly on radio.[434] French television was partly liberalized in the next two-decade with the creation of several commercial channels, mainly thanks to cable and satellite television. In 2005 the national service Télévision Numérique Terrestre introduced digital television all over the territory, allowing the creation of other channels. The four existing national channels are owned by state-owned consortium France Télévisions, funded by advertising revenue and TV licence fees. Public broadcasting group Radio France run five national radio stations. Among these public media are Radio France Internationale, which broadcasts programs in French all over the world, and Franco-German TV channel TV5 Monde. In 2006, the government created global news channel France 24. Long-established TV channels TF1 (privatized in 1987), France 2 and France 3 have the highest shares, while radio stations RTL, Europe 1 and state-owned France Inter are the least listened to. Society See also: Human rights in France and LGBT rights in France Sculpture of Marianne, a common national personification of the French Republic According to a BBC poll in 2010, based on 29,977 responses in 28 countries, France is globally seen as a positive influence in the world's affairs: 49% have a positive view of the country's influence, whereas 19% have a negative view.[435][436] The Nation Brand Index of 2008 suggested that France has the second best international reputation, only behind Germany.[437] A global opinion poll for the BBC saw France ranked the fourth most positively viewed nation in the world (behind Germany, Canada and the United Kingdom) in 2014.[438] According to a poll in 2011, the French were found to have the highest level of religious tolerance and to be the country where the highest proportion of the population defines its identity primarily in term of nationality and not religion.[439] As of 2011[update], 75% of French had a favourable view of the United States, making France one of the most pro-American countries in the world.[440] As of 2017[update], the favourable view of the United States had dropped to 46%.[441] In January 2010, the magazine International Living ranked France as ""best country to live in"", ahead of 193 other countries, for the fifth year running.[442] The OECD Better Life Index states that ""France performs well in many measures of well-being relative to most other countries in the Better Life Index.""[443] The French Revolution continues to permeate the country's collective memory. The tricolour flag of France,[444] the anthem ""La Marseillaise"", and the motto Liberté, égalité, fraternité, defined in Title 1 of the Constitution as national symbols, all emerged during the cultural ferment of the early revolution, along with Marianne, a common national personification. In addition, Bastille Day, the national holiday, commemorates the storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789.[445] A common and traditional symbol of the French people is the Gallic rooster. Its origins date back to Antiquity, since the Latin word Gallus meant both ""rooster"" and ""inhabitant of Gaul"". Then this figure gradually became the most widely shared representation of the French, used by French monarchs, then by the Revolution and under the successive republican regimes as representation of the national identity, used for some stamps and coins.[446] French flags displayed on the Champs Elysées after France's victory at the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The French Tricolore is enshrined in the French Constitution as the national emblem of the French Republic.[447] France is one of the world leaders of gender equality in the workplace: as of 2017, it has 36.8% of its corporate board seats held by women, which makes it the leader of the G20 for that metric;[448] and was ranked in 2019 by the World Bank as one of the only 6 countries in the world where women have the same work rights as men.[449] France is one of the most liberal countries in the world when it comes to LGBT rights: a 2020 Pew Research Center poll found that 86% of the French think that same-sex relationships should be accepted by society, one of the highest acceptance rates in the world (comparable to that of other Western European nations).[450] France legalized same-sex marriage and adoption in 2013.[451] The government has used its diplomatic clout to support LGBT rights throughout the world, notably in the United Nations.[452] In 2020, France was ranked 5th in the Environmental Performance Index (behind the United Kingdom), out of 180 countries ranked by Yale University in that study.[453] Being the host country of the 2015 Paris Climate Change Conference, the French government was instrumental in securing the 2015 Paris agreement, a success that has been credited to its ""openness and experience in diplomacy"".[454] Cuisine Main article: French cuisine French wines are usually made to accompany French cuisine. French cuisine is renowned for being one of the finest in the world.[455][456] According to the regions, traditional recipes are different, the North of the country prefers to use butter as the preferred fat for cooking, whereas olive oil is more commonly used in the South.[457] Moreover, each region of France has iconic traditional specialties: Cassoulet in the Southwest, Choucroute in Alsace, Quiche in the Lorraine region, Beef bourguignon in the Bourgogne, provençal Tapenade, etc. France's most renowned products are wines,[458] including Champagne, Bordeaux, Bourgogne, and Beaujolais as well as a large variety of different cheeses, such as Camembert, Roquefort and Brie. There are more than 400 different varieties.[459][460] A meal often consists of three courses, hors d'œuvre or entrée (introductory course, sometimes soup), plat principal (main course), fromage (cheese course) or dessert, sometimes with a salad offered before the cheese or dessert. Hors d'œuvres could include terrine de saumon au basilic, lobster bisque, foie gras, French onion soup or a croque monsieur. The plat principal could include a pot au feu or steak frites. The dessert could be mille-feuille pastry, a macaron, an éclair, crème brûlée, mousse au chocolat, crêpes, or Café liégeois. Some French cheeses with fruits French cuisine is also regarded as a key element of the quality of life and the attractiveness of France.[442] A French publication, the Michelin guide, awards Michelin stars for excellence to a select few establishments.[461][462] The acquisition or loss of a star can have dramatic effects on the success of a restaurant. By 2006, the Michelin Guide had awarded 620 stars to French restaurants, at that time more than any other country, although the guide also inspects more restaurants in France than in any other country (by 2010, Japan was awarded as many Michelin stars as France, despite having half the number of Michelin inspectors working there).[463][464] In addition to its wine tradition, France is also a major producer of beer and rum. The three main French brewing regions are Alsace (60% of national production), Nord-Pas-de-Calais and Lorraine. France produces rum via distilleries located on islands such as Reunion Island in the southern Indian Ocean. Sports Main article: Sport in France Starting in 1903, the Tour de France is the oldest and most prestigious of Grands Tours, and the world's most famous cycling race.[465] France hosts ""the world's biggest annual sporting event"", the Tour de France,[466] and other popular sports played in France include: football, judo, tennis,[467] rugby union[468] and pétanque. France has hosted events such as the 1938 and 1998 FIFA World Cups,[469] the 2007 Rugby World Cup,[470] and will host the 2023 Rugby World Cup. The country also hosted the 1960 European Nations' Cup, UEFA Euro 1984, UEFA Euro 2016 and 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup. The Stade de France in Saint-Denis is France's largest stadium and was the venue for the 1998 FIFA World Cup and 2007 Rugby World Cup finals. Since 1903, France is famous for its 24 Hours of Le Mans sports car endurance race.[471] Several major tennis tournaments take place in France, including the Paris Masters and the French Open, one of the four Grand Slam tournaments. French martial arts include Savate and Fencing. Pierre de Coubertin, father of the modern Olympic Games France has a close association with the Modern Olympic Games; it was a French aristocrat, Baron Pierre de Coubertin, who suggested the Games' revival, at the end of the 19th century.[472][473] After Athens was awarded the first Games, in reference to the Olympics' Greek origins, Paris hosted the second Games in 1900.[474] Paris was the first home of the International Olympic Committee, before it moved to Lausanne.[475] Since 1900, France has hosted the Olympics on 4 further occasions: the 1924 Summer Olympics, again in Paris[473] and three Winter Games (1924 in Chamonix, 1968 in Grenoble and 1992 in Albertville).[473] Similar to the Olympics, France introduced Olympics for the deaf people (Deaflympics) in 1924 with the idea of a French deaf car mechanic, Eugène Rubens-Alcais who paved the way to organise the inaugural edition of the Summer Deaflympics in Paris.[476] Both the national football team and the national rugby union team are nicknamed ""Les Bleus"" in reference to the team's shirt colour as well as the national French tricolour flag. Football is the most popular sport in France, with over 1,800,000 registered players, and over 18,000 registered clubs.[477] The football team is among the most successful in the world, with two FIFA World Cup victories in 1998 and 2018,[478] one FIFA World Cup second place in 2006,[479] and two UEFA European Championships in 1984[480] and 2000.[481] Zinedine Zidane was named the best European footballer of the past 50 years in a 2004 UEFA poll.[482] The top national football club competition is Ligue 1. France has produced some of the greatest players in the world, including three time FIFA World Player of the Year Zinedine Zidane, three time Ballon d'Or recipient Michel Platini, record holder for most goals scored at a World Cup Just Fontaine, first football player to receive the Légion d'honneur Raymond Kopa, and the record goalscorer for the French national team Thierry Henry.[483] The French Open, also called Roland-Garros, is a major tennis tournament held over two weeks between late May and early June at the Stade Roland-Garros in Paris. It is the premier clay court tennis championship event in the world and the second of four annual Grand Slam tournaments.[484] Rugby union is popular, particularly in Paris and the southwest of France.[485] The national rugby union team has competed at every Rugby World Cup, and takes part in the annual Six Nations Championship.

We seek to increase the visibility, impact, and influence of these issues among key stakeholders to advance the course of the critical water-related challenges of our times. 2019 marked the start of a new triennial strategy and streamlined a new set of programs. The World Water Council’s Task Forces, and its wider membership, have gone into action  focusing on Water Security, Water Financing, Global Changes, and IWRM and Transversality. In addition to the World Water Council's main initiatives, members are also encouraged to propose work on new and emerging issues. Financing Water The financing world is no longer lacking in innovation for the water sector. In recent years, the challenge of financing water infrastructure has been met with new thinking around blended finance and hybridity. Link to Water Financing webpage Water Security The concept of water security captures a broad concept: the availability of an adequate quantity and quality of water to sustain socioeconomic development, livelihoods, health and ecosystems, everywhere. In other words, water security is fundamental to development. Given its central importance, it is also a priority in the Council’s strategy. Link to Water Security webpage Global Changes The Global Changes program is a response to  large-scale forces reshaping the world of water and affecting water resources globally. Link to Global Changes webpage Water and climate change With key partners in the sector, the Council focuses on elevating the role of water in adapting to climate change and increasing resilience at all levels. Link to Water and climate change webpage IWRM and Transversality Governance is perhaps the most important factor for a world seeking to overcome a host of interconnected water threats and changes. In recognition of this, the Council is refining concepts around integrated water resource management (IWRM) and water governance as a resource connecting every domain of sustainable development. Link to IWRM and Transversality webpage Involving key political actors To strengthen and deepen political engagement, the Council works with governments, parliamentarians and partners to increase the visibility of water on the agenda of key multilateral political forums. Link to Involving key political actors webpage Cities at the heart of growth The Council works to enhance water security in cities by helping local and regional authorities to prioritize the role of water for sustainable urban development and planning.

This means looking beyond the next flood or storm to understand long-term climate vulnerabilities. It means helping society to prepare for and adapt to future weather extremes and other climate impacts through strategies and plans for disaster risk reduction. This requires a good analysis of climate change and flood risk mapping, and good knowledge of the urbanized vulnerability to floods in such territories. Finding solutions to these challenging disasters also requires close collaboration between scientists, practitioners, and residents from local, regional, national, and international organizations whether they are public or private. Therefore, a series of the International Symposium on Flash Floods in Wadi Systems (ISFF) were held in; Japan (1st ISFF); Egypt (2nd ISFF); Oman (3rd ISFF); Morocco (4th ISFF); Japan (5th ISFF) and the 6th ISFF will be held in Jordan September 2021.

The founding members of WWEA are the national wind energy associations in many countries. The other members include consulting firms, scientific institutions, labs, academicians, students, wind energy enthusiasts, and equipment suppliers. Membership[edit] There are different membership categories: Ordinary members: wind energy associations Scientific members: scientific and research institutes Corporate members: companies and public bodies individual members WWEA has more than 600 members in more than 100 countries from all continents (as of November 2019). Organisational structure[edit] WWEA is governed by a board currently consisting of the President Peter Rae,[2] Australia, and Vice Presidents from all continents. A complete list of the WWEA board members which represent all continents can be found on the WWEA website www.wwindea.org. Headquarters[edit] The WWEA Head Office is situated in Bonn, close to the UN Campus, managed by the Secretary-General Stefan Gsänger. International policy debate[edit] WWEA is the voice supporting wind energy and other renewables at energy conferences and in the media around the world. WWEA statements like the WWEC resolutions have been taken up in international discussions and are guiding political decision-makers. WWEA also participated in the International Conference for Renewable Energies Renewables 2004 (Bonn, June 2004) and BIREC Beijing International Renewable Energy Conference 2005. WWEA has been granted Special Consultative Status at the United Nations in the year 2007, has been accredited at the UNFCCC and cooperates with organizations like UNEP, UNESCO, UNDESA, the IEA and the World Bank. Since 2003, it has supported the initiative to establish an International Renewable Energy Agency IRENA which was founded in Bonn on 26 January 2009. WWEA is a founding member of International Renewable Energy Alliance (IREA), consisting of the International Hydropower Association (IHA), the International Solar Energy Society (ISES), the International Geothermal Association (IGA) and since June 2009 the World Bioenergy Association (WBA). WWEA cooperates with other international renewable energy organizations; for example, it is represented at the Steering Committee of the REN21 global policy network and is a member of the World Council for Renewable Energy (WCRE). World Wind Energy Conferences (WWEC)[edit] WWEA organises World Wind Energy Conferences and Exhibitions (WWECs) in a different continent every year. WWECs have been held in Berlin (Germany) in 2002, Cape Town (South Africa) in 2003, and Beijing (China) in 2004. The 3rd WWEC in Beijing was attended by over 2000 participants thus becoming the biggest wind event ever held outside the EU and the US. The 4th WWEC took place in Melbourne (Australia). The 5th WWEC in New Delhi, India, from 6–8 November 2006, had the participation of nearly 2000 delegates from all over the world. The 6th WWEC took place in Mar del Plata, ARGENTINA in October 2007, jointly organised by Argentine Wind Energy Association (AAEE) and WWEA (see www.wwec2007.org) The 7th Special Topic ""Community Power"" WWEC took place in Kingston, Ontario, CANADA, in June 2008, jointly organised by Ontario Sustainable Energy Association OSEA, St Lawrence College, Kingston (SLC) and WWEA (see www.wwec2008.com) The WWEC2009 was organised together with the Korean Wind Energy Association on Jeju Island, South Korea, from 23 to 25 June 2009. The WWEC2010 was held in Istanbul/Turkey from 15 to 17 June 2010 under the theme ""Large-scale integration of wind power"". The WWEC2011 was held in Cairo/Egypt from 31 October to 2 November 2011 under the theme ""Greening Energy: Converting Deserts into Power Houses"". (www.wwec2011.net) The WWEC2012 was held in Bonn/Germany from 3 to 5 July 2012 under the theme ""Community Power – Citizens' Power"". (www.wwec2012.net) The WWEC2013 was held in Havana, Cuba from 3 to 5 June 2013 under the theme ""Opening Doors to Caribbean Winds"" The WWEC2014 was held in Shanghai, China, from 7 to 9 April 2014, under the theme ""Distributed Generation: Matching supply and demand"" The WWEC2015 was held in Jerusalem, from 26 to 28 October 2015, under the theme ""Innovation for 100% Renewable Energy"" The WWEC2016 was held in Tokyo, from 31 October to 2 November 2016. WWEC2017 was held in Malmo, Sweden in June 2017. These conferences have had a far-reaching impact on the Wind Energy Policy landscape of the respective countries. China embarked upon its wind energy program after WWEC 2004 held in Beijing and today (2013) the country is leading in wind energy installations. The conference in India in 2006 had extraordinary global participation and was addressed by the then President of India Honorable Dr. A P J Kalam. WWEC 2006 also included a Painting Competition having the participation of School Children from all over Delhi. This contributed to raising the level of awareness about wind energy among school-going children. The WWEC2008 in Kingston achieved the first feed-in tariff legislation in North America, the Green Energy Act of Ontario.

It explores and develops models, strategies and instruments to support sustainable development at local, national and international level. Research at the Wuppertal Institute focuses on ecology and its relation to economy and society. Special emphasis is put on analyzing and supporting technological and social innovations that decouple prosperity of economic growth from the use of natural resources. The organization's activities are centered on developing transformation processes aimed at shaping a climate-friendly and resource-efficient world.[2] Contents 1 Organization and networks 2 History 3 Research 4 Communicating sustainability 5 See also 6 External links 7 References Organization and networks[edit] The Wuppertal Institute collaborates with universities and institutes in Germany and abroad. It has for instance formal cooperation agreements with the Lund University, the Department of Environmental Science and Engineering of the Tsinghua University Beijing, the University of Osnabrück,[3] the HafenCity University Hamburg, the Center for Environment and Energy Research and Studies (CEERS) in Teheran and the Bergische Universität Wuppertal.[4] A cooperation agreement was also reached with the University of Kassel. Furthermore, the Wuppertal Institute and the Institute for Entrepreneurship and Innovation Research (iENTIRE) agreed upon corporate research. Joint research projects with the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES) in Japan and The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) in India are regularly conducted.[5] The institute is also a member of the Johannes Rau Research Association[6] and the Ecological Research Network (Ecornet).[7] The Wuppertal Institute understands itself as an intermediary between science, economy and politics; therefore, its sustainability research design is application-oriented. It has the legal status of a non-profit limited company (gemeinnützige Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung, according to German law). It receives basic funding from the Federal State North Rhine-Westphalia, the sole owner of the Wuppertal Institute. The major part of its funding derives from third-party research projects. The Wuppertal Institute’s clients cover governmental organisations ranging from local authorities to ministries at both state and national levels; business and industry ranging from medium-sized companies to corporate groups and industrial associations; civil society ranging from environmental associations to churches, trade unions and foundations. The Wuppertal Institute is based in Wuppertal and employs approximately 240 workers. Two-thirds are research staff and come from a wide variety of background disciplines: natural and environmental sciences, geography, systems sciences, engineering, planning, law, economics, and political and social science. The staff consists of roughly as many men as women. The Berlin office[8] promotes cooperation with scientific institutes and research partners in the capital. An International Advisory Board[9] stands for the independence and the Institute’s scientific quality and provides advice with regard to strategic basic research issues. History[edit] The Wuppertal Institute started its research work in 1991 headed by Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker.[10] The Institute's mission – formulated in its partnership agreement – was first of all to ""promote measures and initiatives to secure the climate situation, to improve the environment and to save energy, as an interface between the scientific pursuit of knowledge and its practical application”. Founding President Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker advocated a resource strategy founded on reducing resource use by means of what he called an ""efficiency revolution"" pointing the way towards new models of prosperity. Efficiency is the cornerstone of the book Factor Four - Doubling Wealth, Halving Resource Use by Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker, Amory and Hunter Lovins (Rocky Mountain Institute, USA). They assembled fifty examples of successful products using half the usual amount of natural resources, including hypercars, ""Passivhaus"", superwindows, long-lasting furniture and a summer holiday in the Austrian Alps. The book was accepted as a report to the Club of Rome and was on the best-seller lists for several months. It has been translated into more than ten languages. Peter Hennicke had studied and worked on using efficiency potentials in the field of energy use before he came to the Wuppertal Institute. He intensified research in this area as head of the Energy Division; later on he succeeded Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker as president from 2000 to 2008. Friedrich Schmidt-Bleek, the vice-president at that time, found a large audience proposing his MIPS concept for gauging material input per service unit and identifying ""ecological rucksacks"" that ""carry"" products and services when they arrive at the consumer. He was aware of the fact that the then prevailing environmental policy was not paying enough attention to the great material flows; he advocated that besides already existing successful legal measures for pollutant emissions limitation it would be necessary to reduce the material flows in order to conserve the finite material, energy and natural resources. With his concept of the “Ecological rucksack” he introduced his ideas into the scientific and political debates. In 2001, the Tokyo-based Takeda Foundation awarded Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker and Friedrich Schmidt-Bleek a price worth one hundred million Japanese yen for their concepts ""Factor Four"", ""MIPS"" and ""ecological rucksack"", an expression of the Wuppertal Institute's international recognition. Following the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, the implementation of Agenda 21 was high on the (environmental) policy agenda in many countries. The first attempts were very timid and showed the lack of experience in implementing the new leading principle called sustainable development. The 1995 report Zukunftsfähiges Deutschland (published as “Greening the North”), commissioned by BUND and Misereor, was to remedy this: The Wuppertal Institute team, headed by Reinhard Loske and Raimund Bleischwitz, pioneered a new methodology. Beginning with an estimate of the Earth's carrying capacity, the ""environmental space"", the study developed leading principles to help Germans avoid overusing the environmental space to which they are ""entitled"". The principles are based on concepts such as efficiency and sufficiency. Prof. Dr. Wolfang Sachs, a well-known scientist of the Wuppertal Institute, member of the Club of Rome and lead author at the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), directed the study “Sustainable Germany in a Globalised World”. It was published as a book in October 2008 by Friends of the Earth Germany (BUND), Church Development Service (Evangelischer Entwicklungsdienst - EED) and ""Friends of the Earth"" to stimulate the social discussion on a globally sustainable development. Agreed in 1997, the Kyoto Protocol took the global nature of the climate change into account , even if it was ratified only many years later. The Kyoto Protocol was the first international agreement to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The Wuppertal Institute's Climate Policy Division was closely involved in setting this milestone in the international climate debate. At the Earth Summit 2002 in Johannesburg, ten years after the Rio Conference, the international agreements on sustainable development were updated with new timetables and priorities for action. The World Summit also formulated an integrated concept of science and policy in its Plan of Implementation. This plan was implemented both methodologically and in terms of its content in the Wuppertal Institute's research programme in 2003, whose conceptual research agenda was restructured under the keyword “Sustainability Research”. In August 2005, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Wuppertal Institute jointly founded the Centre on Sustainable Consumption and Production (CSCP). As a member of the globally cooperating UNEP Centres, its mission is to develop practically oriented contributions to the ten-year Sustainable Consumption and Production programme that was agreed upon at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in 2002. In September 2004, the Wuppertal Institute’s Berlin office was established under the direction of Hermann E. Ott. Wolfgang Sachs took over the management in 2009, Maja Göpel in 2013 and Daniel Vallentin and Timon Wehnert in 2017. Since 2019 Timon Wehnert and Stefan Werland are heading the Berlin office. Since its foundation, the Wuppertal Institute has been working on visions for a sustainable and low-CO2 society. Based on the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Germany by 80 percent by 2050, the Wuppertal Institute has developed various long-term scenarios for the German energy system. They serve as a basis for the long-term energy study of the German government and also the climate protection policies of municipalities strategies towards the long-term goal of a low-carbon society. A study commissioned by Siemens AG for the city of Munich shows what this could look like. Long-term energy scenarios, such as those developed by the Wuppertal Institute together with research partners for the German Federal Ministry of the Environment, contributed to the German government's decision after the Fukushima reactor accident to abandon nuclear power generation and initiate the energy turnaround. Uwe Schneidewind became the third president of the institute on March 1, 2010. He took over as successor to Peter Hennicke after he had been retired for more than two years. Schneidewind holds a professorship at the Bergische Universität Wuppertal. At the Wuppertal Institute, Schneidewind placed the transdisciplinary understanding of science within the conceptual framework of transition research. In 2011 the German Advisory Council on Global Change (WBGU) published its main report ""World in Transition – A Social Contract for Sustainability"", which calls for a fundamental change, a shift from a fossil to a post-fossil society. The task of research, it states, is to examine these transition processes and to support the transformation through specific innovations in the relevant sectors. This approach characterizes the scientific work at the institute. It also includes the question of securing prosperity, the ""good life"", beyond unrestrained economic growth. In the sustainability discourse, it is becoming increasingly clear that more efficient use of resources is eminently important, but it is not enough because rebound effects often reduce efficiency gains. The Wuppertal Institute is conducting ever more concrete research into how sufficiency strategies can be effective and how they can be used politically, in fields such as construction, energy or local politics. In summer 2018, the book ""Die Große Transformation – Eine Einführung in die Kunst gesellschaftlichen Wandels"" by Uwe Schneidewind (S. Fischer Verlag, Frankfurt am Main) was published. The book aims to find answers to the question of how the transformation to a socially and ecologically just world can succeed. For this it needs “Zukunftskunst” (""future art""), writes Schneidewind. It refers to the ability to combine cultural change, smart politics, new economic activity and innovative technologies, and on this basis to make creative contributions to the implementation of the energy turnaround, mobility turnaround, food turnaround or sustainable change in cities. Uwe Schneidewind left the Wuppertal Institute on 30 April 2020. Since May 1, 2020 Manfred Fischedick has been leading the Institute as Scientific Managing Director. Manfred Fischedick, who studied engineering and is Professor of Economics at the Schumpeter School of Business and Economics at the Bergische Universität Wuppertal, deals in his work with system analytical questions, aspects of innovation dynamics and the market introduction of new technologies. Research[edit] Conceiving strategies for sustainable development requires an integrated approach both to policy and to scientific research. The quest to live and work in a way that conserves resources often raises questions that cannot be answered by one area of policy alone or by a single scientific discipline. This is the Wuppertal Institute’s starting point. Its interdisciplinary research teams bring together the expertise of scientists and economists as well as geographers and spatial planners, engineers, philosophers and historians. The Wuppertal Institute has been conducting research at the international level since its foundation. The Institute’s international research activities follow a transformative approach, where researchers work in transdisciplinary and multicultural teams that address global and context-specific sustainability challenges. In its research projects, the Wuppertal Institute cooperates closely with stakeholders at various levels and incorporates their perspectives and scope for action. The Institute’s main research areas at international level include the energy and industry system transitions, the global climate governance, the low-carbon urban transformation (incl. mobility), the sustainable production and consumption, and the circular economy. In the course of 2019, structural changes were implemented as the institute grew in size. 13 new Research Units organised within the four divisions began their work. With the new structure, the institute intends to take into account the higher management complexity and also to position the research fields more clearly.[11] In its scientific activities, the Institute advises ministries at the federal and state level as well as the European Union and is thus frequently in the public eye. On 2 March 2020, Svenja Schulze (German Federal Minister of the Environment) and Manfred Fischedick presented the federal government's first ""Digital Policy Agenda for the Environment"" at a federal press conference.[12] It contains 70 concrete measures that combine digitalisation and climate protection such as: The Federal Environment Agency is to create a registry for data centers as a data basis for future efficiency targets. Smartphones and tablets are to be given a longer life through new rules at EU level, thereby saving resources. Under the European Union's Ecodesign Directive, manufacturers will be required to make batteries and displays replaceable and offer spare parts or updates for a minimum period of time. The Wuppertal Institute intensively accompanied the Federal Ministry of the Environment in the preparation of the environmental digital agenda and provided scientific advice. The scientific work of the institute is mainly conducted in four divisions, which are divided into Research Units. The Division Future Energy and Mobility Systems examines questions of technology and infrastructure, taking a systems analysis approach. In the fields of energy and mobility it explores what technical and social innovations will facilitate the transition to sustainable structures, what implications this process has and what chances it offers. It sees key challenges in the decarbonisation of energy systems, the climate-friendly restructuring of energy-intensive industries, and the sustainable modernisation of our cities.[13] The following Research Units belong to the division: International Energy Transitions[14]This Research Unit develops solution paths for sustainable energy systems and industrial transformation in developing regions - especially in Southeast Asia, Latin America and the MENA region. Sectors and Technologies[15]This research team develops strategies for the climate neutrality of the energy, transport and industrial sectors, taking into account their energy and resource impacts. Structural Change and Innovation[16]This Research Unit shapes sustainable structural change, contributes to increasing the innovative capacity of industrial regions and evaluates opportunities from climate change and resource conservation. Systems and Infrastructures[17]This Research Unit analyses the interaction of technologies, infrastructures and energy sources for the transformation to a sustainable energy system. The Division Energy, Transport and Climate Policy focuses on strategies and instruments for effective and integrated energy, transport and climate policies at the local, regional, national and international level. Central themes are the synergy effects of policy strategies that support the sustainable development of energy and transport systems as well as climate protection generally as well as policy instruments in the field of energy end-use efficiency.[18] The following Research Units belong to the division: Global Climate Governance[19]The unit sees itself as a navigator of international governance processes and, as an architect of transformative solutions on a global level, develops integrated strategies and instruments for the transformation to sustainability. Energy Policy[20]This Research Unit analyses policy packages and instruments for the transition to a sustainable, largely carbon-free, energy-efficient and renewable energy system. Mobility and International Cooperation[21]The research team develops implementation-oriented global concepts that combine local demand, expertise and policy advice with financing institutions. Mobility and Transport Policy[22]The researchers investigate which policies and actors can shape the transformation of the transport system towards sustainable mobility in Germany. Urban Transitions[23]The Research Unit develops innovative concepts and instruments that enable sustainable transformations in cities and regions. The Division Sustainable Production and Consumption[24] develops instruments, concepts and strategies to promote the transition to more sustainable patterns of production and consumption. The division explores opportunities for creating a sustainable, resource-light society, and a socio-ecological market economy in which products and services offer a high quality of life and are produced in a sustainable way, globally and locally. One of the main elements is the development and market launch of products considered sustainable in terms of their entire life cycle as well as production processes optimised right the way along the added value chain. The research focuses on the social-ecological balance of entrepreneurial, social, and technological changes and innovations in line with the implementation of the United Nations' international Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).[25] The following Research Units belong to the division: Innovation Labs[26]This Research Unit develops open innovation processes for sustainable production and consumption patterns in companies and municipalities, politics and society. Production and Consumption Systems[27]The research team analyses and evaluates production and consumption structures from the perspective of resource efficiency and sustainability. The Division Circular Economy focuses its research on how to succeed in transforming the resource-intensive, linear economy into a circular economy in which the value and the raw materials contained in products are preserved in the best way possible after their usage phase. The division develops targets and instruments for environmental services and digitalisation, which enables closed material cycles and creates the conditions for sustainable digitalisation. Germany and the European Union target a comprehensive transition towards a circular economy, in which waste should be avoided, products and their components should be used as long as possible, and waste is regarded as a potential resource. Related challenges and questions focuses on the design of infrastructures, policy mixes and governance structures. Necessary innovation processes are the starting point for the institute's research.[28] The following Research Units belong to the division: Digital Transformation[29]The Research Unit examines the perspectives of digitalisation and how it can be used for sustainability transformation and to achieve a sustainable digital transformation. Material Loops[30]The focus of this Research Unit is the closing of material cycles as a central prerequisite for a sustainable, globally viable level of resource consumption. Berlin OfficeAs a branch of the Wuppertal Institute, the Berlin office[31] promotes cooperation between the Wuppertal Institute and other academic and research institutions in Berlin. Communicating sustainability[edit] The Institute has always sought to communicate research results to its different target groups, addressing them in their own ‘language’. The research is communicated actively: to the scientific world, by means of numerous scientific publications, by organising and participating in lectures, symposia, workshops and conferences and by engaging in networks with research partners in Germany and abroad; to decision makers in the realms of policy, business and society, through scientific research and consulting projects, projects that launch innovations (model projects, pilot projects), dialogues with partners from business and industry, and also through publications oriented towards the users' needs; to the general public, by means of popular science books, public events as well as articles and reports in the press, on radio and television; to young people, through projects carried out with schools and other educational institutions, through supporting young scientists in collaboration with universities, and through teaching and educational materials.

The organization's activities are centered on developing transformation processes aimed at shaping a climate-friendly and resource-efficient world.[2] Contents 1 Organization and networks 2 History 3 Research 4 Communicating sustainability 5 See also 6 External links 7 References Organization and networks[edit] The Wuppertal Institute collaborates with universities and institutes in Germany and abroad. It has for instance formal cooperation agreements with the Lund University, the Department of Environmental Science and Engineering of the Tsinghua University Beijing, the University of Osnabrück,[3] the HafenCity University Hamburg, the Center for Environment and Energy Research and Studies (CEERS) in Teheran and the Bergische Universität Wuppertal.[4] A cooperation agreement was also reached with the University of Kassel. Furthermore, the Wuppertal Institute and the Institute for Entrepreneurship and Innovation Research (iENTIRE) agreed upon corporate research. Joint research projects with the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES) in Japan and The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) in India are regularly conducted.[5] The institute is also a member of the Johannes Rau Research Association[6] and the Ecological Research Network (Ecornet).[7] The Wuppertal Institute understands itself as an intermediary between science, economy and politics; therefore, its sustainability research design is application-oriented. It has the legal status of a non-profit limited company (gemeinnützige Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung, according to German law). It receives basic funding from the Federal State North Rhine-Westphalia, the sole owner of the Wuppertal Institute. The major part of its funding derives from third-party research projects. The Wuppertal Institute’s clients cover governmental organisations ranging from local authorities to ministries at both state and national levels; business and industry ranging from medium-sized companies to corporate groups and industrial associations; civil society ranging from environmental associations to churches, trade unions and foundations. The Wuppertal Institute is based in Wuppertal and employs approximately 240 workers. Two-thirds are research staff and come from a wide variety of background disciplines: natural and environmental sciences, geography, systems sciences, engineering, planning, law, economics, and political and social science. The staff consists of roughly as many men as women. The Berlin office[8] promotes cooperation with scientific institutes and research partners in the capital. An International Advisory Board[9] stands for the independence and the Institute’s scientific quality and provides advice with regard to strategic basic research issues. History[edit] The Wuppertal Institute started its research work in 1991 headed by Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker.[10] The Institute's mission – formulated in its partnership agreement – was first of all to ""promote measures and initiatives to secure the climate situation, to improve the environment and to save energy, as an interface between the scientific pursuit of knowledge and its practical application”. Founding President Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker advocated a resource strategy founded on reducing resource use by means of what he called an ""efficiency revolution"" pointing the way towards new models of prosperity. Efficiency is the cornerstone of the book Factor Four - Doubling Wealth, Halving Resource Use by Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker, Amory and Hunter Lovins (Rocky Mountain Institute, USA). They assembled fifty examples of successful products using half the usual amount of natural resources, including hypercars, ""Passivhaus"", superwindows, long-lasting furniture and a summer holiday in the Austrian Alps. The book was accepted as a report to the Club of Rome and was on the best-seller lists for several months. It has been translated into more than ten languages. Peter Hennicke had studied and worked on using efficiency potentials in the field of energy use before he came to the Wuppertal Institute. He intensified research in this area as head of the Energy Division; later on he succeeded Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker as president from 2000 to 2008. Friedrich Schmidt-Bleek, the vice-president at that time, found a large audience proposing his MIPS concept for gauging material input per service unit and identifying ""ecological rucksacks"" that ""carry"" products and services when they arrive at the consumer. He was aware of the fact that the then prevailing environmental policy was not paying enough attention to the great material flows; he advocated that besides already existing successful legal measures for pollutant emissions limitation it would be necessary to reduce the material flows in order to conserve the finite material, energy and natural resources. With his concept of the “Ecological rucksack” he introduced his ideas into the scientific and political debates. In 2001, the Tokyo-based Takeda Foundation awarded Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker and Friedrich Schmidt-Bleek a price worth one hundred million Japanese yen for their concepts ""Factor Four"", ""MIPS"" and ""ecological rucksack"", an expression of the Wuppertal Institute's international recognition. Following the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, the implementation of Agenda 21 was high on the (environmental) policy agenda in many countries. The first attempts were very timid and showed the lack of experience in implementing the new leading principle called sustainable development. The 1995 report Zukunftsfähiges Deutschland (published as “Greening the North”), commissioned by BUND and Misereor, was to remedy this: The Wuppertal Institute team, headed by Reinhard Loske and Raimund Bleischwitz, pioneered a new methodology. Beginning with an estimate of the Earth's carrying capacity, the ""environmental space"", the study developed leading principles to help Germans avoid overusing the environmental space to which they are ""entitled"". The principles are based on concepts such as efficiency and sufficiency. Prof. Dr. Wolfang Sachs, a well-known scientist of the Wuppertal Institute, member of the Club of Rome and lead author at the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), directed the study “Sustainable Germany in a Globalised World”. It was published as a book in October 2008 by Friends of the Earth Germany (BUND), Church Development Service (Evangelischer Entwicklungsdienst - EED) and ""Friends of the Earth"" to stimulate the social discussion on a globally sustainable development. Agreed in 1997, the Kyoto Protocol took the global nature of the climate change into account , even if it was ratified only many years later. The Kyoto Protocol was the first international agreement to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The Wuppertal Institute's Climate Policy Division was closely involved in setting this milestone in the international climate debate. At the Earth Summit 2002 in Johannesburg, ten years after the Rio Conference, the international agreements on sustainable development were updated with new timetables and priorities for action. The World Summit also formulated an integrated concept of science and policy in its Plan of Implementation. This plan was implemented both methodologically and in terms of its content in the Wuppertal Institute's research programme in 2003, whose conceptual research agenda was restructured under the keyword “Sustainability Research”. In August 2005, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Wuppertal Institute jointly founded the Centre on Sustainable Consumption and Production (CSCP). As a member of the globally cooperating UNEP Centres, its mission is to develop practically oriented contributions to the ten-year Sustainable Consumption and Production programme that was agreed upon at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in 2002. In September 2004, the Wuppertal Institute’s Berlin office was established under the direction of Hermann E. Ott. Wolfgang Sachs took over the management in 2009, Maja Göpel in 2013 and Daniel Vallentin and Timon Wehnert in 2017. Since 2019 Timon Wehnert and Stefan Werland are heading the Berlin office. Since its foundation, the Wuppertal Institute has been working on visions for a sustainable and low-CO2 society. Based on the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Germany by 80 percent by 2050, the Wuppertal Institute has developed various long-term scenarios for the German energy system. They serve as a basis for the long-term energy study of the German government and also the climate protection policies of municipalities strategies towards the long-term goal of a low-carbon society. A study commissioned by Siemens AG for the city of Munich shows what this could look like. Long-term energy scenarios, such as those developed by the Wuppertal Institute together with research partners for the German Federal Ministry of the Environment, contributed to the German government's decision after the Fukushima reactor accident to abandon nuclear power generation and initiate the energy turnaround. Uwe Schneidewind became the third president of the institute on March 1, 2010. He took over as successor to Peter Hennicke after he had been retired for more than two years. Schneidewind holds a professorship at the Bergische Universität Wuppertal. At the Wuppertal Institute, Schneidewind placed the transdisciplinary understanding of science within the conceptual framework of transition research. In 2011 the German Advisory Council on Global Change (WBGU) published its main report ""World in Transition – A Social Contract for Sustainability"", which calls for a fundamental change, a shift from a fossil to a post-fossil society. The task of research, it states, is to examine these transition processes and to support the transformation through specific innovations in the relevant sectors. This approach characterizes the scientific work at the institute. It also includes the question of securing prosperity, the ""good life"", beyond unrestrained economic growth. In the sustainability discourse, it is becoming increasingly clear that more efficient use of resources is eminently important, but it is not enough because rebound effects often reduce efficiency gains. The Wuppertal Institute is conducting ever more concrete research into how sufficiency strategies can be effective and how they can be used politically, in fields such as construction, energy or local politics. In summer 2018, the book ""Die Große Transformation – Eine Einführung in die Kunst gesellschaftlichen Wandels"" by Uwe Schneidewind (S. Fischer Verlag, Frankfurt am Main) was published. The book aims to find answers to the question of how the transformation to a socially and ecologically just world can succeed. For this it needs “Zukunftskunst” (""future art""), writes Schneidewind. It refers to the ability to combine cultural change, smart politics, new economic activity and innovative technologies, and on this basis to make creative contributions to the implementation of the energy turnaround, mobility turnaround, food turnaround or sustainable change in cities. Uwe Schneidewind left the Wuppertal Institute on 30 April 2020. Since May 1, 2020 Manfred Fischedick has been leading the Institute as Scientific Managing Director. Manfred Fischedick, who studied engineering and is Professor of Economics at the Schumpeter School of Business and Economics at the Bergische Universität Wuppertal, deals in his work with system analytical questions, aspects of innovation dynamics and the market introduction of new technologies. Research[edit] Conceiving strategies for sustainable development requires an integrated approach both to policy and to scientific research. The quest to live and work in a way that conserves resources often raises questions that cannot be answered by one area of policy alone or by a single scientific discipline. This is the Wuppertal Institute’s starting point. Its interdisciplinary research teams bring together the expertise of scientists and economists as well as geographers and spatial planners, engineers, philosophers and historians. The Wuppertal Institute has been conducting research at the international level since its foundation. The Institute’s international research activities follow a transformative approach, where researchers work in transdisciplinary and multicultural teams that address global and context-specific sustainability challenges. In its research projects, the Wuppertal Institute cooperates closely with stakeholders at various levels and incorporates their perspectives and scope for action. The Institute’s main research areas at international level include the energy and industry system transitions, the global climate governance, the low-carbon urban transformation (incl. mobility), the sustainable production and consumption, and the circular economy. In the course of 2019, structural changes were implemented as the institute grew in size. 13 new Research Units organised within the four divisions began their work. With the new structure, the institute intends to take into account the higher management complexity and also to position the research fields more clearly.[11] In its scientific activities, the Institute advises ministries at the federal and state level as well as the European Union and is thus frequently in the public eye. On 2 March 2020, Svenja Schulze (German Federal Minister of the Environment) and Manfred Fischedick presented the federal government's first ""Digital Policy Agenda for the Environment"" at a federal press conference.[12] It contains 70 concrete measures that combine digitalisation and climate protection such as: The Federal Environment Agency is to create a registry for data centers as a data basis for future efficiency targets. Smartphones and tablets are to be given a longer life through new rules at EU level, thereby saving resources. Under the European Union's Ecodesign Directive, manufacturers will be required to make batteries and displays replaceable and offer spare parts or updates for a minimum period of time. The Wuppertal Institute intensively accompanied the Federal Ministry of the Environment in the preparation of the environmental digital agenda and provided scientific advice. The scientific work of the institute is mainly conducted in four divisions, which are divided into Research Units. The Division Future Energy and Mobility Systems examines questions of technology and infrastructure, taking a systems analysis approach. In the fields of energy and mobility it explores what technical and social innovations will facilitate the transition to sustainable structures, what implications this process has and what chances it offers. It sees key challenges in the decarbonisation of energy systems, the climate-friendly restructuring of energy-intensive industries, and the sustainable modernisation of our cities.[13] The following Research Units belong to the division: International Energy Transitions[14]This Research Unit develops solution paths for sustainable energy systems and industrial transformation in developing regions - especially in Southeast Asia, Latin America and the MENA region. Sectors and Technologies[15]This research team develops strategies for the climate neutrality of the energy, transport and industrial sectors, taking into account their energy and resource impacts. Structural Change and Innovation[16]This Research Unit shapes sustainable structural change, contributes to increasing the innovative capacity of industrial regions and evaluates opportunities from climate change and resource conservation. Systems and Infrastructures[17]This Research Unit analyses the interaction of technologies, infrastructures and energy sources for the transformation to a sustainable energy system. The Division Energy, Transport and Climate Policy focuses on strategies and instruments for effective and integrated energy, transport and climate policies at the local, regional, national and international level. Central themes are the synergy effects of policy strategies that support the sustainable development of energy and transport systems as well as climate protection generally as well as policy instruments in the field of energy end-use efficiency.[18] The following Research Units belong to the division: Global Climate Governance[19]The unit sees itself as a navigator of international governance processes and, as an architect of transformative solutions on a global level, develops integrated strategies and instruments for the transformation to sustainability. Energy Policy[20]This Research Unit analyses policy packages and instruments for the transition to a sustainable, largely carbon-free, energy-efficient and renewable energy system. Mobility and International Cooperation[21]The research team develops implementation-oriented global concepts that combine local demand, expertise and policy advice with financing institutions. Mobility and Transport Policy[22]The researchers investigate which policies and actors can shape the transformation of the transport system towards sustainable mobility in Germany. Urban Transitions[23]The Research Unit develops innovative concepts and instruments that enable sustainable transformations in cities and regions. The Division Sustainable Production and Consumption[24] develops instruments, concepts and strategies to promote the transition to more sustainable patterns of production and consumption. The division explores opportunities for creating a sustainable, resource-light society, and a socio-ecological market economy in which products and services offer a high quality of life and are produced in a sustainable way, globally and locally. One of the main elements is the development and market launch of products considered sustainable in terms of their entire life cycle as well as production processes optimised right the way along the added value chain. The research focuses on the social-ecological balance of entrepreneurial, social, and technological changes and innovations in line with the implementation of the United Nations' international Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).[25] The following Research Units belong to the division: Innovation Labs[26]This Research Unit develops open innovation processes for sustainable production and consumption patterns in companies and municipalities, politics and society. Production and Consumption Systems[27]The research team analyses and evaluates production and consumption structures from the perspective of resource efficiency and sustainability. The Division Circular Economy focuses its research on how to succeed in transforming the resource-intensive, linear economy into a circular economy in which the value and the raw materials contained in products are preserved in the best way possible after their usage phase. The division develops targets and instruments for environmental services and digitalisation, which enables closed material cycles and creates the conditions for sustainable digitalisation. Germany and the European Union target a comprehensive transition towards a circular economy, in which waste should be avoided, products and their components should be used as long as possible, and waste is regarded as a potential resource. Related challenges and questions focuses on the design of infrastructures, policy mixes and governance structures. Necessary innovation processes are the starting point for the institute's research.[28] The following Research Units belong to the division: Digital Transformation[29]The Research Unit examines the perspectives of digitalisation and how it can be used for sustainability transformation and to achieve a sustainable digital transformation. Material Loops[30]The focus of this Research Unit is the closing of material cycles as a central prerequisite for a sustainable, globally viable level of resource consumption. Berlin OfficeAs a branch of the Wuppertal Institute, the Berlin office[31] promotes cooperation between the Wuppertal Institute and other academic and research institutions in Berlin. Communicating sustainability[edit] The Institute has always sought to communicate research results to its different target groups, addressing them in their own ‘language’. The research is communicated actively: to the scientific world, by means of numerous scientific publications, by organising and participating in lectures, symposia, workshops and conferences and by engaging in networks with research partners in Germany and abroad; to decision makers in the realms of policy, business and society, through scientific research and consulting projects, projects that launch innovations (model projects, pilot projects), dialogues with partners from business and industry, and also through publications oriented towards the users' needs; to the general public, by means of popular science books, public events as well as articles and reports in the press, on radio and television; to young people, through projects carried out with schools and other educational institutions, through supporting young scientists in collaboration with universities, and through teaching and educational materials.

""Each tree species has a unique ecological role to play,"" she said. ""With 30% of the world's tree species threatened with extinction, we need to urgently scale-up conservation action."" The report, State of the World's Trees, found that at least 30% of the 60,000 known tree species face extinction.Some 142 species have already vanished from the wild, while 442 are on the very edge of extinction, with fewer than 50 individual trees remaining.The biggest threats to trees globally are forest clearance for crops (impacting 29% of species), logging (27%), clearance for livestock grazing or farming (14%), clearance for development (13%) and fire (13%). image sourceMalin Riversimage captionOne-in-five tree species are used by humans for food, fuel, timber, medicines and moreClimate change, extreme weather and sea level rise are growing threats to trees. But the authors say with conservation action, there is hope for the future.""The report gives us that road map to mobilise the wider conservation community and other key players to ensure that tree conservation is at the forefront of the conservation agenda,"" said Dr Rivers.The experts are calling for a number of actions, including:Preserving existing forests and expanding protected areas (currently at least 64% of all tree species can be found in at least one protected area)Keeping threatened species in botanic gardens or seed banks in the hope they can one day be returned to the wild (currently about 30% of all trees are backed up in this way)Providing education to ensure reforestation and tree planting schemes are carried out scientifically, with the right tree in the right place, including rare and threatened speciesIncreasing funding for tree conservation.image sourceDavid Bartholomewimage captionTropical forests are facing threats from climate change and extreme weatherScientists estimate that one million animals and plant species are threatened with extinction.Over the past 300 years, global forest area has decreased by about 40% and 29 countries have lost more than 90% of their forest cover.Research shows that seven main commodities drive more than half of deforestation worldwide.Trees at particular risk of extinction include:Large tropical trees known as dipterocarps that are being lost due to the expansion of palm oil plantationsOak trees lost to farming and development in parts of Mexico, Chile and ArgentinaEbony and rosewood trees being felled for timber in Madagascar Magnolia trees at threat from unsustainable plant collectingTrees such as ash that are dying from pests and diseases in the UK and North AmericaFollow Helen on Twitter.Related TopicsEnvironmentNatureTreesBiodiversityConservationExtinctionClimate changeTop StoriesStorm Ida kills dozens across US north-eastPresident Biden calls for ""historic investment"" to tackle the climate crisis as the US reels from the storm.Published1 hour agoThe moment flash floods hit NY subway.

These cover a wide range of issues, as shown below. These change over time and reflect the changing areas of local and global concern.

Fossil Free Yale Project Bright Yale Bee Space Students for Carbon Dividends (S4CD) GREEN @ Yale EECO Fossil Free Yale Fossil Free Yale (FFY) is a grassroots student organization that fights to hold Yale accountable for its complicity in the climate crisis, demanding that Yale divest (sell their investments) immediately from fossil fuel companies and cancel its holdings in Puerto Rican debt. Recognizing that the planet and its most vulnerable people are actively suffering from the grave impacts of climate change, we leverage our power as students at Yale to join forces with the global struggle for climate justice. Building coalitions with Yale student organizations, alumni, professors, and New Haven activists, we use education, community-building, administrative engagement, protest, and direct action to fight for our precious future.

It is a member of the Yale Student Environmental Coalition, an umbrella organization for all Yale student environmental groups. Our name comes from the term “bee space” coined by Yale alum L. L. Langstroth, the inventor of the modern Langstroth beehive, to describe the natural spacing between honeycomb layers in a hive. We aim to educate students about the practice of beekeeping and lead workshops related to bees, honey and derived products. In addition to caring for farmed bees, we hope to raise awareness and appreciation of wild American bees.

We aim to catalyze change to reach the institution’s sustainability goals for 2025 as soon as possible. Although we are the youngest environmental club and started only in March 2018, we have many projects already in the works, such as the Sustainable Butteries project and Project Green Challenge outreach. The scale of our projects can be small (within a residential college) or large (New Haven wide), and whatever ideas we decide to pursue depends entirely on our members. Potential ideas include: running a program-return scheme with the Dramat, collaborating with New Haven businesses to institute a strawless campaign and bring-your-own (BYO) discount and many many more!

Foster a sense of community around people and earth at Yale, uniting networks of environmentalists as well as providing opportunities for students of all backgrounds to engage and share their perspectives on environmental issues. About Us: The Yale Student Environmental Coalition (YSEC) is the umbrella organization for student environmentalists and all student environmental groups in Yale College. Founded in 1986, YSEC strives to educate the Yale community about current environmental challenges and debates, advocating for environmentally conscious behavior, responsible consumer choice, sustainable university policy, and environmental justice.  We seek to partner with campus organizations, other colleges and universities, non-profits, and major international initiatives in order to bring our objectives to light at Yale, within New Haven, and around the world. Since 1986, the Yale Student Environmental Coalition and its constituent groups have built a genuine tradition of successful environmental initiatives. It was a YSEC report authored at the turn of the last century, “The Yale Green Plan,” which led to the creation of the Yale Office of Sustainability. The President of Yale University, Peter Salovey, has credited work of the Yale Student Environmental Coalition as being “very influential in helping to establish the kinds of sustainability policies and organized effort around sustainability that we see on campus today.” The Yale Student Environmental Coalition is a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit, an observer NGO at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and an indispensable part of the Yale community. Over the years, YSEC has won multiple external awards for its work and its contributions to the global good. YSEC provides students with a network to all conceivable opportunities, facilities, and activities related to environment, at Yale and at large. We unite Yale undergraduates, bringing together those who share an understanding that environmental issues worldwide overarch many of the very greatest threats to political justice and economic prosperity.

Founded in 1701 as the Collegiate School, it is the third-oldest institution of higher education in the United States and one of the nine Colonial Colleges chartered before the American Revolution. The Collegiate School was renamed Yale College in 1718 to honor the school's largest private benefactor for the first century of its existence, Elihu Yale.[7][8] Yale University is referred to as a member of the Big Three (colleges) and is considered one of the most prestigious universities in the nation and in the world.[9][10][11][12] Chartered by Connecticut Colony, the Collegiate School was established in 1701 by clergy to educate Congregational ministers before moving to New Haven in 1716. Originally restricted to theology and sacred languages, the curriculum began to incorporate humanities and sciences by the time of the American Revolution. In the 19th century, the college expanded into graduate and professional instruction, awarding the first PhD in the United States in 1861 and organizing as a university in 1887. Yale's faculty and student populations grew after 1890 with rapid expansion of the physical campus and scientific research. Yale is organized into fourteen constituent schools: the original undergraduate college, the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and twelve professional schools. While the university is governed by the Yale Corporation, each school's faculty oversees its curriculum and degree programs. In addition to a central campus in downtown New Haven, the university owns athletic facilities in western New Haven, a campus in West Haven, Connecticut, and forests and nature preserves throughout New England. As of June 2020, the university's endowment was valued at $31.1 billion, the second largest of any educational institution.[1] The Yale University Library, serving all constituent schools, holds more than 15 million volumes and is the third-largest academic library in the United States.[13][14] Students compete in intercollegiate sports as the Yale Bulldogs in the NCAA Division I – Ivy League. As of October 2020, 65 Nobel laureates, five Fields Medalists, four Abel Prize laureates, and three Turing award winners have been affiliated with Yale University. In addition, Yale has graduated many notable alumni, including five U.S. Presidents, 19 U.S. Supreme Court Justices, 31 living billionaires,[15] and many heads of state. Hundreds of members of Congress and many U.S. diplomats, 78 MacArthur Fellows, 252 Rhodes Scholars, 123 Marshall Scholars, and nine Mitchell Scholars have been affiliated with the university.

(July 2021) Early history of Yale College[edit] Origins[edit] Charter creating the Collegiate School, which became Yale College, October 9, 1701 Yale traces its beginnings to ""An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School"", a would-be charter passed during a meeting in New Haven by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut on October 9, 1701. The Act was an effort to create an institution to train ministers and lay leadership for Connecticut. Soon after, a group of ten Congregational ministers, Samuel Andrew, Thomas Buckingham, Israel Chauncy, Samuel Mather (nephew of Increase Mather), Rev. James Noyes II (son of James Noyes), James Pierpont, Abraham Pierson, Noadiah Russell, Joseph Webb, and Timothy Woodbridge, all alumni of Harvard, met in the study of Reverend Samuel Russell, located in Branford, Connecticut, to donate their books to form the school's library.[16] The group, led by James Pierpont, is now known as ""The Founders"".[17] A Front View of Yale-College and the College Chapel, printed by Daniel Bowen in 1786 From its origin it is known as the ""Collegiate School"", the institution opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson, who is today considered the first president of Yale. Pierson lived in Killingworth (now Clinton). The school moved to Saybrook and then Wethersfield. In 1716, it moved to New Haven, Connecticut. Meanwhile, there was a rift forming at Harvard between its sixth president, Increase Mather, and the rest of the Harvard clergy, whom Mather viewed as increasingly liberal, ecclesiastically lax, and overly broad in Church polity. The feud caused the Mathers to champion the success of the Collegiate School in the hope that it would maintain the Puritan religious orthodoxy in a way that Harvard had not.[18] Rev. Jason Haven, the minister at the First Church and Parish in Dedham, Massachusetts had been considered for the presidency on account of his orthodox theology and for ""Neatness dignity and purity of Style [which] surpass those of all that have been mentioned,"" but was passed over due to his ""very Valetudinary and infirm State of Health.""[19] Naming and development[edit] Coat of arms of the family of Elihu Yale, after whom the university was named in 1718 In 1718, at the behest of either Rector Samuel Andrew or the colony's Governor Gurdon Saltonstall, Cotton Mather contacted the successful Boston born businessman Elihu Yale to ask him for financial help in constructing a new building for the college. Through the persuasion of Jeremiah Dummer, Elihu ""Eli"" Yale, who had made a fortune in Madras while working for the East India Company as the first president of Fort St. George (largely through secret contracts with Madras merchants that were illegal under Company policy[20]), donated nine bales of goods, which were sold for more than £560, a substantial sum of money at the time. Cotton Mather suggested that the school change its name to ""Yale College.""[21] The Welsh name Yale is the Anglicized spelling of the Iâl, which the family estate at Plas yn Iâl, near the village of Llandegla, was called. Meanwhile, a Harvard graduate working in England convinced some 180 prominent intellectuals to donate books to Yale. The 1714 shipment of 500 books represented the best of modern English literature, science, philosophy and theology at the time.[22] It had a profound effect on intellectuals at Yale. Undergraduate Jonathan Edwards discovered John Locke's works and developed his original theology known as the ""new divinity."" In 1722 the Rector and six of his friends, who had a study group to discuss the new ideas, announced that they had given up Calvinism, become Arminians, and joined the Church of England. They were ordained in England and returned to the colonies as missionaries for the Anglican faith. Thomas Clapp became president in 1745 and while he attempted to return the college to Calvinist orthodoxy, he did not close the library. Other students found Deist books in the library.[23] Founders' connections to the slave trade[edit] One of Elihu Yale's responsibilities as president of Fort St. George was overseeing its slave trade, though he himself was never a slave trader, never owned slaves, opposed the slave trade, and imposed several restrictions on it during his tenure.[24] Critics nonetheless argue that he benefited from the trade by having it as one of his responsibilities as president, despite not owning any of the traded human beings or profiting from their sales.[25] The controversy over Yale University being named to honor the slave trader Elihu Yale dates back to at least 1994. In 2007, Yale University removed a painting which shows Elihu Yale attended to by a child slave. At the time, Yale University stated that the issues with Elihu Yale had begun at least 13 years prior. Although Elihu Yale was the president of the East India Company, a Yale University spokesperson claimed that, ""...Elihu Yale did not support slavery...""[26] A 2017 Wall Street Journal opinion article also called for renaming Yale University.[27][28] Since 2016, Yale University has acknowledged that Elihu Yale was ""...involved [in] and profited from the slave trade.""[29] The controversy over Yale's name started anew in 2020 with a Yale Daily News post, ""Yale Has to Go!""[30] After years of protest, Yale University renamed Calhoun College as Hopper College in 2017. Calhoun College was named for a South Carolina slave owner and anti-abolitionist, Vice President John C. Calhoun.[31][32][33] Yale University also acquired a slave plantation to finance its graduate program.[34] Yale University has multiple other buildings named to honor slave owners, including Bishop George Berkeley, Timothy Dwight and Ezra Stiles.[35] Curriculum[edit] Connecticut Hall, oldest building on the Yale campus, built between 1750 and 1753 First diploma awarded by Yale College, granted to Nathaniel Chauncey in 1702 Yale College undergraduates follow a liberal arts curriculum with departmental majors and is organized into a social system of residential colleges. Yale was swept up by the great intellectual movements of the period—the Great Awakening and the Enlightenment—due to the religious and scientific interests of presidents Thomas Clap and Ezra Stiles. They were both instrumental in developing the scientific curriculum at Yale while dealing with wars, student tumults, graffiti, ""irrelevance"" of curricula, desperate need for endowment and disagreements with the Connecticut legislature.[36][37][page needed] Serious American students of theology and divinity, particularly in New England, regarded Hebrew as a classical language, along with Greek and Latin, and essential for the study of the Old Testament in the original words. The Reverend Ezra Stiles, president of the college from 1778 to 1795, brought with him his interest in the Hebrew language as a vehicle for studying ancient Biblical texts in their original language (as was common in other schools), requiring all freshmen to study Hebrew (in contrast to Harvard, where only upperclassmen were required to study the language) and is responsible for the Hebrew phrase אורים ותמים (Urim and Thummim) on the Yale seal. A 1746 graduate of Yale, Stiles came to the college with experience in education, having played an integral role in the founding of Brown University, in addition to having been a minister.[38] Stiles' greatest challenge occurred in July 1779 when British forces occupied New Haven and threatened to raze the college. However, Yale graduate Edmund Fanning, Secretary to the British General in command of the occupation, intervened and the college was saved. In 1803, Fanning was granted an honorary degree LL.D. for his efforts.[39] Students[edit] As the only college in Connecticut from 1701 to 1823, Yale educated the sons of the elite.[40] Punishable offenses for students included cardplaying, tavern-going, destruction of college property, and acts of disobedience to college authorities. During this period, Harvard was distinctive for the stability and maturity of its tutor corps, while Yale had youth and zeal on its side.[41] The emphasis on classics gave rise to a number of private student societies, open only by invitation, which arose primarily as forums for discussions of modern scholarship, literature and politics. The first such organizations were debating societies: Crotonia in 1738, Linonia in 1753 and Brothers in Unity in 1768. While the societies no longer exist, commemorations to them can be found with names given to campus structures, like Brothers in Unity Courtyard in Branford College. 19th century[edit] Old Brick Row in 1807 The Yale Report of 1828 was a dogmatic defense of the Latin and Greek curriculum against critics who wanted more courses in modern languages, mathematics, and science. Unlike higher education in Europe, there was no national curriculum for colleges and universities in the United States. In the competition for students and financial support, college leaders strove to keep current with demands for innovation. At the same time, they realized that a significant portion of their students and prospective students demanded a classical background. The Yale report meant the classics would not be abandoned. During this period, all institutions experimented with changes in the curriculum, often resulting in a dual-track curriculum. In the decentralized environment of higher education in the United States, balancing change with tradition was a common challenge because it was difficult for an institution to be completely modern or completely classical.[42][43] A group of professors at Yale and New Haven Congregationalist ministers articulated a conservative response to the changes brought about by the Victorian culture. They concentrated on developing a person possessed of religious values strong enough to sufficiently resist temptations from within, yet flexible enough to adjust to the 'isms' (professionalism, materialism, individualism, and consumerism) tempting him from without.[44][page needed] William Graham Sumner, professor from 1872 to 1909, taught in the emerging disciplines of economics and sociology to overflowing classrooms of students. Sumner bested President Noah Porter, who disliked the social sciences and wanted Yale to lock into its traditions of classical education. Porter objected to Sumner's use of a textbook by Herbert Spencer that espoused agnostic materialism because it might harm students.[45] Until 1887, the legal name of the university was ""The President and Fellows of Yale College, in New Haven."" In 1887, under an act passed by the Connecticut General Assembly, Yale was renamed to the present ""Yale University.""[46] Sports and debate[edit] The Revolutionary War soldier Nathan Hale (Yale 1773) was the archetype of the Yale ideal in the early 19th century: a manly yet aristocratic scholar, equally well-versed in knowledge and sports, and a patriot who ""regretted"" that he ""had but one life to lose"" for his country. Western painter Frederic Remington (Yale 1900) was an artist whose heroes gloried in the combat and tests of strength in the Wild West. The fictional, turn-of-the-20th-century Yale man Frank Merriwell embodied this same heroic ideal without racial prejudice, and his fictional successor Frank Stover in the novel Stover at Yale (1911) questioned the business mentality that had become prevalent at the school. Increasingly the students turned to athletic stars as their heroes, especially since winning the big game became the goal of the student body, the alumni, and the team itself.[47] Yale's four-oared crew team posing with the 1876 Centennial Regatta trophy, won in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Along with Harvard and Princeton, Yale students rejected British concepts about 'amateurism' in sports and constructed athletic programs that were uniquely American, such as football.[48][page needed] The Harvard–Yale football rivalry began in 1875. Between 1892, when Harvard and Yale met in one of the first intercollegiate debates,[49][page needed] and in 1909 (the year of the first Triangular Debate of Harvard, Yale and Princeton) the rhetoric, symbolism, and metaphors used in athletics were used to frame these early debates. Debates were covered on front pages of college newspapers and emphasized in yearbooks, and team members even received the equivalent of athletic letters for their jackets. There were also rallies to send off the debating teams to matches, but the debates never attained the broad appeal that athletics enjoyed. One reason may be that debates do not have a clear winner, as is the case in sports, and that scoring is subjective. In addition, with late 19th-century concerns about the impact of modern life on the human body, athletics offered hope that neither the individual nor the society was coming apart.[50] In 1909–10, football faced a crisis resulting from the failure of the previous reforms of 1905–06, which sought to solve the problem of serious injuries. There was a mood of alarm and mistrust, and, while the crisis was developing, the presidents of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton developed a project to reform the sport and forestall possible radical changes forced by government upon the sport. Presidents Arthur Hadley of Yale, A. Lawrence Lowell of Harvard, and Woodrow Wilson of Princeton worked to develop moderate reforms to reduce injuries. Their attempts, however, were reduced by rebellion against the rules committee and the formation of the Intercollegiate Athletic Association. While the big three had attempted to operate independently of the majority, the changes pushed did reduce injuries.[51] Expansion[edit] Starting with the addition of the Yale School of Medicine in 1810, the college expanded gradually from then on, establishing the Yale Divinity School in 1822, Yale Law School in 1822, the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in 1847, the now-defunct Sheffield Scientific School in 1847,[52] and the Yale School of Fine Arts in 1869. In 1887, under the presidency of Timothy Dwight V, Yale College was renamed to Yale University, and the former name was subsequently applied only to the undergraduate college. The university would continue to expand greatly into the 20th and 21st century, adding the Yale School of Music in 1894, the Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies in 1900, the Yale School of Public Health in 1915, the Yale School of Architecture in 1916, the Yale School of Nursing 1923, the Yale School of Drama in 1955, the Yale School of Management in 1976, and the Jackson School of Global Affairs which is planned to open in 2022.[53] The Sheffield Scientific School would also reorganize its relationship with the university to teach only undergraduate courses. Expansion caused controversy about Yale's new roles. Noah Porter, a moral philosopher, was president from 1871 to 1886. During an age of tremendous expansion in higher education, Porter resisted the rise of the new research university, claiming that an eager embrace of its ideals would corrupt undergraduate education. Many of Porter's contemporaries criticized his administration, and historians since have disparaged his leadership.[citation needed] Historian George Levesque argues Porter was not a simple-minded reactionary, uncritically committed to tradition, but a principled and selective conservative.[54][page needed] Levesque continues, saying he did not endorse everything old or reject everything new; rather, he sought to apply long-established ethical and pedagogical principles to a rapidly changing culture. Levesque concludes, mention how he may have misunderstood some of the challenges of his time, but he correctly anticipated the enduring tensions that have accompanied the emergence and growth of the modern university. 20th century[edit] Medicine[edit] Woolsey Hall c. 1905 Milton Winternitz led the Yale School of Medicine as its dean from 1920 to 1935. Dedicated to the new scientific medicine established in Germany, he was equally fervent about ""social medicine"" and the study of humans in their culture and environment. He established the ""Yale System"" of teaching, with few lectures and fewer exams, and strengthened the full-time faculty system; he also created the graduate-level Yale School of Nursing and the Psychiatry Department and built numerous new buildings. Progress toward his plans for an Institute of Human Relations, envisioned as a refuge where social scientists would collaborate with biological scientists in a holistic study of humankind, unfortunately, lasted for only a few years before the opposition of resentful anti-Semitic colleagues drove him to resign.[55] Faculty[edit] Richard Rummell's 1906 watercolor of the Yale campus facing northBefore World War II, most elite university faculties counted among their numbers few, if any, Jews, blacks, women, or other minorities; Yale was no exception. By 1980, this condition had been altered dramatically, as numerous members of those groups held faculty positions.[56] Almost all members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences—and some members of other faculties—teach undergraduate courses, more than 2,000 of which are offered annually.[57] Women[edit] In 1793, Lucinda Foote passed the entrance exams for Yale College, but was rejected by the President on the basis of her gender.[58] Women studied at Yale University as early as 1892, in graduate-level programs at the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.[59] In 1966, Yale began discussions with its sister school Vassar College about merging to foster coeducation at the undergraduate level. Vassar, then all-female and part of the Seven Sisters—elite higher education schools that historically served as sister institutions to the Ivy League when most Ivy League institutions still only admitted men—tentatively accepted, but then declined the invitation. Both schools introduced coeducation independently in 1969.[60] Amy Solomon was the first woman to register as a Yale undergraduate;[61] she was also the first woman at Yale to join an undergraduate society, St. Anthony Hall. The undergraduate class of 1973 was the first class to have women starting from freshman year;[62] at the time, all undergraduate women were housed in Vanderbilt Hall at the south end of Old Campus.[63] A decade into co-education, student assault and harassment by faculty became the impetus for the trailblazing lawsuit Alexander v. Yale. In the late 1970s, a group of students and one faculty member sued Yale for its failure to curtail campus sexual harassment by especially male faculty. The case was party built from a 1977 report authored by plaintiff Ann Olivarius, now a feminist attorney known for fighting sexual harassment, ""A report to the Yale Corporation from the Yale Undergraduate Women's Caucus.""[64] This case was the first to use Title IX to argue and establish that the sexual harassment of female students can be considered illegal sex discrimination. The plaintiffs in the case were Olivarius, Ronni Alexander (now a professor at Kobe University, Japan), Margery Reifler (works in the Los Angeles film industry), Pamela Price (civil rights attorney in California), and Lisa E. Stone (works at Anti-Defamation League). They were joined by Yale classics professor John “Jack” J. Winkler, who died in 1990. The lawsuit, brought partly by Catharine MacKinnon, alleged rape, fondling, and offers of higher grades for sex by several Yale faculty, including Keith Brion, professor of flute and Director of Bands, Political Science professor Raymond Duvall (now at the University of Minnesota), English professor Michael Cooke, and coach of the field hockey team, Richard Kentwell. While unsuccessful in the courts, the legal reasoning behind the case changed the landscape of sex discrimination law and resulted in the establishment of Yale's Grievance Board and the Yale Women's Center.[65] In March 2011 a Title IX complaint was filed against Yale by students and recent graduates, including editors of Yale's feminist magazine Broad Recognition, alleging that the university had a hostile sexual climate.[66] In response, the university formed a Title IX steering committee to address complaints of sexual misconduct.[67] Afterwards, universities and colleges throughout the US also established sexual harassment grievance procedures. Class[edit] Yale, like other Ivy League schools, instituted policies in the early 20th century designed to maintain the proportion of white Protestants from notable families in the student body (see numerus clausus), and was one of the last of the Ivies to eliminate such preferences, beginning with the class of 1970.[68] 21st century[edit] In 2006, Yale and Peking University (PKU) established a Joint Undergraduate Program in Beijing, an exchange program allowing Yale students to spend a semester living and studying with PKU honor students.[69] In July 2012, the Yale University-PKU Program ended due to weak participation.[69] In 2007 outgoing Yale President Rick Levin characterized Yale's institutional priorities: ""First, among the nation's finest research universities, Yale is distinctively committed to excellence in undergraduate education. Second, in our graduate and professional schools, as well as in Yale College, we are committed to the education of leaders.""[70] In 2009, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair picked Yale as one location – the others being Britain's Durham University and Universiti Teknologi Mara – for the Tony Blair Faith Foundation's United States Faith and Globalization Initiative.[71] As of 2009, former Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo is the director of the Yale Center for the Study of Globalization and teaches an undergraduate seminar, ""Debating Globalization"".[72] As of 2009, former presidential candidate and DNC chair Howard Dean teaches a residential college seminar, ""Understanding Politics and Politicians"".[73] Also in 2009, an alliance was formed among Yale, University College London, and both schools' affiliated hospital complexes to conduct research focused on the direct improvement of patient care—a growing field known as translational medicine. President Richard Levin noted that Yale has hundreds of other partnerships across the world, but ""no existing collaboration matches the scale of the new partnership with UCL"".[74] In August 2013, a new partnership with the National University of Singapore led to the opening of Yale-NUS College in Singapore, a joint effort to create a new liberal arts college in Asia featuring a curriculum including both Western and Asian traditions.[75] In 2020, in the wake of protests around the world focused on racial relations and criminal justice reform, the #CancelYale tag was used on social media to demand that Elihu Yale's name be removed from Yale University. Most support for the change stemmed from politically conservative pundits, such as Mike Cernovich and Ann Coulter, satirizing perceived excesses of online cancel culture.[76] Yale was president of the East India Company, a trading company that traded slaves as well as goods, [77] and his singularly large donation[78][79] led to Yale relying on money from the slave-trade for its first scholarships and endowments.[25][80] In August 2020, the US Justice Department claimed that Yale discriminated against Asian and white candidates on the basis of their race. The university, however, denied the report.[81] In early February 2021, under the new Biden administration, the Justice Department withdrew the lawsuit. The group, Students for Fair Admissions, known for a similar lawsuit against Harvard alleging the same issue, plans to refile the lawsuit.[82] Yale alumni in politics[edit] The Boston Globe wrote that ""if there's one school that can lay claim to educating the nation's top national leaders over the past three decades, it's Yale"".[83][verification needed] Yale alumni were represented on the Democratic or Republican ticket in every U.S. presidential election between 1972 and 2004.[84] Yale-educated Presidents since the end of the Vietnam War include Gerald Ford, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush, and major-party nominees during this period include Hillary Clinton (2016), John Kerry (2004), Joseph Lieberman (Vice President, 2000), and Sargent Shriver (Vice President, 1972). Other Yale alumni who have made serious bids for the Presidency during this period include Amy Klobuchar (2020), Tom Steyer (2020), Ben Carson (2016), Howard Dean (2004), Gary Hart (1984 and 1988), Paul Tsongas (1992), Pat Robertson (1988) and Jerry Brown (1976, 1980, 1992). Several explanations have been offered for Yale's representation in national elections since the end of the Vietnam War. Various sources note the spirit of campus activism that has existed at Yale since the 1960s, and the intellectual influence of Reverend William Sloane Coffin on many of the future candidates.[85][verification needed] Yale President Richard Levin attributes the run to Yale's focus on creating ""a laboratory for future leaders,"" an institutional priority that began during the tenure of Yale Presidents Alfred Whitney Griswold and Kingman Brewster.[85] Richard H. Brodhead, former dean of Yale College and now president of Duke University, stated: ""We do give very significant attention to orientation to the community in our admissions, and there is a very strong tradition of volunteerism at Yale.""[83] Yale historian Gaddis Smith notes ""an ethos of organized activity"" at Yale during the 20th century that led John Kerry to lead the Yale Political Union's Liberal Party, George Pataki the Conservative Party, and Joseph Lieberman to manage the Yale Daily News.[86] Camille Paglia points to a history of networking and elitism: ""It has to do with a web of friendships and affiliations built up in school.""[87] CNN suggests that George W. Bush benefited from preferential admissions policies for the ""son and grandson of alumni"", and for a ""member of a politically influential family"".[88] New York Times correspondent Elisabeth Bumiller and The Atlantic Monthly correspondent James Fallows credit the culture of community and cooperation that exists between students, faculty, and administration, which downplays self-interest and reinforces commitment to others.[89] During the 1988 presidential election, George H. W. Bush (Yale '48) derided Michael Dukakis for having ""foreign-policy views born in Harvard Yard's boutique"". When challenged on the distinction between Dukakis' Harvard connection and his own Yale background, he said that, unlike Harvard, Yale's reputation was ""so diffuse, there isn't a symbol, I don't think, in the Yale situation, any symbolism in it"" and said Yale did not share Harvard's reputation for ""liberalism and elitism"".[90] In 2004 Howard Dean stated, ""In some ways, I consider myself separate from the other three (Yale) candidates of 2004. Yale changed so much between the class of '68 and the class of '71. My class was the first class to have women in it; it was the first class to have a significant effort to recruit African Americans. It was an extraordinary time, and in that span of time is the change of an entire generation"".[89] Administration and organization[edit] Leadership[edit] School founding School Year founded Yale College 1701 Yale School of Medicine 1810 Yale Divinity School 1822 Yale Law School 1843 Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences 1847 Sheffield Scientific School[52] 1847 Yale School of Fine Arts 1869 Yale School of Music 1894 Yale School of the Environment 1900 Yale School of Public Health 1915 Yale School of Architecture 1916 Yale School of Nursing 1923 David Geffen School of Drama at Yale University 1955 Yale School of Management 1976 Jackson School of Global Affairs Planned for fall 2022[53] The President and Fellows of Yale College, also known as the Yale Corporation, or board of trustees, is the governing body of the university and consists of thirteen standing committees with separate responsibilities outlined in the by-laws. The corporation has 19 members: three ex officio members, ten successor trustees, and six elected alumni fellows.[91] The university has three major academic components: Yale College (the undergraduate program), the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and the twelve professional schools.[92] Yale's former president Richard C. Levin was, at the time, one of the highest paid university presidents in the United States with a 2008 salary of $1.5 million.[93] Yale's succeeding president Peter Salovey ranks 40th with a 2020 salary of $1.16 million.[94] The Yale Provost's Office and similar executive positions have launched several women into prominent university executive positions. In 1977, Provost Hanna Holborn Gray was appointed interim President of Yale and later went on to become President of the University of Chicago, being the first woman to hold either position at each respective school.[95][96] In 1994, Provost Judith Rodin became the first permanent female president of an Ivy League institution at the University of Pennsylvania.[97] In 2002, Provost Alison Richard became the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge.[98] In 2003, the Dean of the Divinity School, Rebecca Chopp, was appointed president of Colgate University and later went on to serve as the President of the Swarthmore College in 2009, and then the first female chancellor of the University of Denver in 2014.[99] In 2004, Provost Dr. Susan Hockfield became the President of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.[100] In 2004, Dean of the Nursing school, Catherine Gilliss, was appointed the Dean of Duke University's School of Nursing and Vice Chancellor for Nursing Affairs.[101] In 2007, Deputy Provost H. Kim Bottomly was named President of Wellesley College.[102] Similar examples for men who've served in Yale leadership positions can also be found. In 2004, Dean of Yale College Richard H. Brodhead was appointed as the President of Duke University.[103] In 2008, Provost Andrew Hamilton was confirmed to be the Vice Chancellor of the University of Oxford.[104] Staff and labor unions[edit] See also: Federation of Hospital and University Employees Yale University staff are represented by several different unions. Clerical and technical workers are represented by Local 34, and service and maintenance workers are represented by Local 35, both of the same union affiliate UNITE HERE.[105] Unlike similar institutions, Yale has consistently refused to recognize its graduate student union, Local 33 (another affiliate of UNITE HERE), citing claims that the union's elections were undemocratic and how graduate students are not employees;[106][107] the move to not recognize the union has been criticized by the American Federation of Teachers.[108] In addition, officers of the Yale University Police Department are represented by the Yale Police Benevolent Association, which affiliated in 2005 with the Connecticut Organization for Public Safety Employees.[105][109] Yale security officers joined the International Union of Security, Police and Fire Professionals of America in late 2010,[110] even though the Yale administration contested the election.[111] In October 2014, after deliberation,[112] Yale security decided to form a new union, the Yale University Security Officers Association, which has since represented the campus security officers.[105][113] Yale has a history of difficult and prolonged labor negotiations, often culminating in strikes.[114][page needed] There have been at least eight strikes since 1968, and The New York Times wrote that Yale has a reputation as having the worst record of labor tension of any university in the U.S.[115] Moreover, Yale has been accused by the AFL–CIO of failing to treat workers with respect,[116] as well as not renewing contracts with professors over involvement in campus labor issues.[117] Yale has responded to strikes with claims over mediocre union participation and the benefits of their contracts.[118] Campus[edit] Yale Law School, located in the Sterling Law Building Interior of Beinecke Library Yale's central campus in downtown New Haven covers 260 acres (1.1 km2) and comprises its main, historic campus and a medical campus adjacent to the Yale–New Haven Hospital. In western New Haven, the university holds 500 acres (2.0 km2) of athletic facilities, including the Yale Golf Course.[119] In 2008, Yale purchased the 17-building, 136-acre (0.55 km2) former Bayer HealthCare complex in West Haven, Connecticut,[120] the buildings of which are now used as laboratory and research space.[121] Yale also owns seven forests in Connecticut, Vermont, and New Hampshire—the largest of which is the 7,840-acre (31.7 km2) Yale-Myers Forest in Connecticut's Quiet Corner—and nature preserves including Horse Island.[122] Yale is noted for its largely Collegiate Gothic campus[123] as well as several iconic modern buildings commonly discussed in architectural history survey courses: Louis Kahn's Yale Art Gallery[124] and Center for British Art, Eero Saarinen's Ingalls Rink and Ezra Stiles and Morse Colleges, and Paul Rudolph's Art & Architecture Building. Yale also owns and has restored many noteworthy 19th-century mansions along Hillhouse Avenue, which was considered the most beautiful street in America by Charles Dickens when he visited the United States in the 1840s.[125] In 2011, Travel+Leisure listed the Yale campus as one of the most beautiful in the United States.[126] Many of Yale's buildings were constructed in the Collegiate Gothic architecture style from 1917 to 1931, financed largely by Edward S. Harkness, including the Yale Drama School.[127][128] Stone sculpture built into the walls of the buildings portray contemporary college personalities, such as a writer, an athlete, a tea-drinking socialite, and a student who has fallen asleep while reading. Similarly, the decorative friezes on the buildings depict contemporary scenes, like a policemen chasing a robber and arresting a prostitute (on the wall of the Law School), or a student relaxing with a mug of beer and a cigarette. The architect, James Gamble Rogers, faux-aged these buildings by splashing the walls with acid,[129] deliberately breaking their leaded glass windows and repairing them in the style of the Middle Ages, and creating niches for decorative statuary but leaving them empty to simulate loss or theft over the ages. In fact, the buildings merely simulate Middle Ages architecture, for though they appear to be constructed of solid stone blocks in the authentic manner, most actually have steel framing as was commonly used in 1930. One exception is Harkness Tower, 216 feet (66 m) tall, which was originally a free-standing stone structure. It was reinforced in 1964 to allow the installation of the Yale Memorial Carillon Statue of Nathan Hale in front of Connecticut Hall Vanderbilt Hall Other examples of the Gothic style are on the Old Campus by architects like Henry Austin, Charles C. Haight and Russell Sturgis. Several are associated with members of the Vanderbilt family, including Vanderbilt Hall,[130] Phelps Hall,[131] St. Anthony Hall (a commission for member Frederick William Vanderbilt), the Mason, Sloane and Osborn laboratories, dormitories for the Sheffield Scientific School (the engineering and sciences school at Yale until 1956) and elements of Silliman College, the largest residential college.[132] The oldest building on campus, Connecticut Hall (built in 1750), is in the Georgian style. Georgian-style buildings erected from 1929 to 1933 include Timothy Dwight College, Pierson College, and Davenport College, except the latter's east, York Street façade, which was constructed in the Gothic style to coordinate with adjacent structures. The Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, designed by Gordon Bunshaft of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, is one of the largest buildings in the world reserved exclusively for the preservation of rare books and manuscripts. The library includes a six-story above-ground tower of book stacks, filled with 180,000 volumes, that is surrounded by large translucent Vermont marble panels and a steel and granite truss. The panels act as windows and subdue direct sunlight while also diffusing the light in warm hues throughout the interior.[133] Near the library is a sunken courtyard, with sculptures by Isamu Noguchi that are said to represent time (the pyramid), the sun (the circle), and chance (the cube).[134] The library is located near the center of the university in Hewitt Quadrangle, which is now more commonly referred to as ""Beinecke Plaza."" Alumnus Eero Saarinen, Finnish-American architect of such notable structures as the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, Washington Dulles International Airport main terminal, Bell Labs Holmdel Complex and the CBS Building in Manhattan, designed Ingalls Rink, dedicated in 1959,[135] as well as the residential colleges Ezra Stiles and Morse.[136] These latter were modeled after the medieval Italian hill town of San Gimignano – a prototype chosen for the town's pedestrian-friendly milieu and fortress-like stone towers.[137] These tower forms at Yale act in counterpoint to the college's many Gothic spires and Georgian cupolas.[138] Yale's Old Campus at dusk, April 2013 Notable nonresidential campus buildings[edit] Harkness Tower Notable nonresidential campus buildings and landmarks include Battell Chapel, Beinecke Rare Book Library, Harkness Tower, Ingalls Rink, Kline Biology Tower, Osborne Memorial Laboratories, Payne Whitney Gymnasium, Peabody Museum of Natural History, Sterling Hall of Medicine, Sterling Law Buildings, Sterling Memorial Library, Woolsey Hall, Yale Center for British Art, Yale University Art Gallery, Yale Art & Architecture Building, and the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art in London. Yale's secret society buildings (some of which are called ""tombs"") were built both to be private yet unmistakable. A diversity of architectural styles is represented: Berzelius, Donn Barber in an austere cube with classical detailing (erected in 1908 or 1910); Book and Snake, Louis R. Metcalfe in a Greek Ionic style (erected in 1901); Elihu, architect unknown but built in a Colonial style (constructed on an early 17th-century foundation although the building is from the 18th century); Mace and Chain, in a late colonial, early Victorian style (built in 1823). (Interior moulding is said to have belonged to Benedict Arnold);Manuscript Society, King Lui-Wu with Dan Kniley responsible for landscaping and Josef Albers for the brickwork intaglio mural. Building constructed in a mid-century modern style; Scroll and Key, Richard Morris Hunt in a Moorish- or Islamic-inspired Beaux-Arts style (erected 1869–70); Skull and Bones, possibly Alexander Jackson Davis or Henry Austin in an Egypto-Doric style utilizing Brownstone (in 1856 the first wing was completed, in 1903 the second wing, 1911 the Neo-Gothic towers in rear garden were completed); St. Elmo, (former tomb) Kenneth M. Murchison, 1912, designs inspired by Elizabethan manor. Current location, brick colonial; and Wolf's Head, Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue, erected 1923–1924, Collegiate Gothic. Sustainability[edit] Yale's Office of Sustainability develops and implements sustainability practices at Yale.[139] Yale is committed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 10% below 1990 levels by the year 2020. As part of this commitment, the university allocates renewable energy credits to offset some of the energy used by residential colleges.[140] Eleven campus buildings are candidates for LEED design and certification.[141] Yale Sustainable Food Project initiated the introduction of local, organic vegetables, fruits, and beef to all residential college dining halls.[142] Yale was listed as a Campus Sustainability Leader on the Sustainable Endowments Institute's College Sustainability Report Card 2008, and received a ""B+"" grade overall.[143] Grove Street Cemetery, New Haven Marsh Botanical Garden Yale Sustainable Food Program Farm Relationship with New Haven[edit] Yale is the largest taxpayer and employer in the City of New Haven,[144] and has often buoyed the city's economy and communities. Yale, however has consistently opposed paying a tax on its academic property.[145] Yale's Art Galleries, along with many other university resources, are free and openly accessible. Yale also funds the New Haven Promise program, paying full tuition for eligible students from New Haven public schools.[146] Town–gown relations[edit] Yale has a complicated relationship with its home city; for example, thousands of students volunteer every year in a myriad of community organizations, but city officials, who decry Yale's exemption from local property taxes, have long pressed the university to do more to help. Under President Levin, Yale has financially supported many of New Haven's efforts to reinvigorate the city. Evidence suggests that the town and gown relationships are mutually beneficial. Still, the economic power of the university increased dramatically with its financial success amid a decline in the local economy.[147] Campus safety[edit] Several campus safety strategies have been pioneered at Yale. The first campus police force was founded at Yale in 1894, when the university contracted city police officers to exclusively cover the campus.[148][149] Later hired by the university, the officers were originally brought in to quell unrest between students and city residents and curb destructive student behavior.[150][151] In addition to the Yale Police Department, a variety of safety services are available including blue phones, a safety escort, and 24-hour shuttle service. In the 1970s and 1980s, poverty and violent crime rose in New Haven, dampening Yale's student and faculty recruiting efforts.[152] Between 1990 and 2006, New Haven's crime rate fell by half, helped by a community policing strategy by the New Haven Police and Yale's campus became the safest among the Ivy League and other peer schools.[153] In 2004, the national non-profit watchdog group Security on Campus filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education, accusing Yale of under-reporting rape and sexual assaults.[154][155] In April 2021, Yale announced that it will require students to receive a COVID-19 vaccine as a condition of being on campus during the fall 2021 term.[156] Academics[edit] Admissions[edit] Admissions statistics2020 enteringclass[157]Change vs.2015[158]Admit rate6.5% ( −0.2)Yield rate54.9% ( −12)Test scores middle 50%SAT EBRW720–780SAT Math740–800ACT Composite33–35High school GPATop 10%†94% ( −3)†Among students whose school ranked Undergraduate admission to Yale College is considered ""most selective"" by U.S. News.[159][160] In 2017, Yale accepted 2,285 students to the Class of 2021 out of 32,914 applicants, for an acceptance rate of 6.9%.[161] 98% of students graduate within six years.[162] Through its program of need-based financial aid, Yale commits to meet the full demonstrated financial need of all applicants. Most financial aid is in the form of grants and scholarships that do not need to be paid back to the university, and the average need-based aid grant for the Class of 2017 was $46,395.[163] 15% of Yale College students are expected to have no parental contribution, and about 50% receive some form of financial aid.[162][164][165] About 16% of the Class of 2013 had some form of student loan debt at graduation, with an average debt of $13,000 among borrowers.[162] Half of all Yale undergraduates are women, more than 39% are ethnic minority U.S. citizens (19% are underrepresented minorities), and 10.5% are international students.[163] 55% attended public schools and 45% attended private, religious, or international schools, and 97% of students were in the top 10% of their high school class.[162] Every year, Yale College also admits a small group of non-traditional students through the Eli Whitney Students Program. Collections[edit] Yale University's Sterling Memorial Library, as seen from Maya Lin's sculpture, Women's Table. The sculpture records the number of women enrolled at Yale over its history; female undergraduates were not admitted until 1969. Yale University Library, which holds over 15 million volumes, is the third-largest university collection in the United States.[13][166] The main library, Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes, and other holdings are dispersed at subject libraries. Rare books are found in several Yale collections. The Beinecke Rare Book Library has a large collection of rare books and manuscripts. The Harvey Cushing/John Hay Whitney Medical Library includes important historical medical texts, including an impressive collection of rare books, as well as historical medical instruments. The Lewis Walpole Library contains the largest collection of 18th‑century British literary works. The Elizabethan Club, technically a private organization, makes its Elizabethan folios and first editions available to qualified researchers through Yale. The Night Café, Vincent van Gogh, 1888, Yale Art Gallery Yale's museum collections are also of international stature. The Yale University Art Gallery, the country's first university-affiliated art museum, contains more than 200,000 works, including Old Masters and important collections of modern art, in the Swartwout and Kahn buildings. The latter, Louis Kahn's first large-scale American work (1953), was renovated and reopened in December 2006. The Yale Center for British Art, the largest collection of British art outside of the UK, grew from a gift of Paul Mellon and is housed in another Kahn-designed building. The Peabody Museum of Natural History in New Haven is used by school children and contains research collections in anthropology, archaeology, and the natural environment. The Yale University Collection of Musical Instruments, affiliated with the Yale School of Music, is perhaps the least-known of Yale's collections because its hours of opening are restricted. The museums once housed the artifacts brought to the United States from Peru by Yale history professor Hiram Bingham in his Yale-financed expedition to Machu Picchu in 1912 – when the removal of such artifacts was legal. The artifacts were restored to Peru in 2012.[167] Academic rankings National ARWU[168] 9 Forbes[169] 3 THE/WSJ[170] 3 U.S. News & World Report[171] 4 Washington Monthly[172] 4 Global ARWU[173] 11 QS[174] 14 THE[175] 8 U.S. News & World Report[176] 11 USNWR graduate school rankings[177] Business 9 Engineering 39 Law 1 Medicine: Primary Care 49 Medicine: Research 15 Nursing: Doctorate 17 Nursing: Master's 14 Rankings[edit] USNWR departmental rankings[177] Biological Sciences 6 Chemistry 9 Clinical Psychology 18 Computer Science 20 Earth Sciences 13 Economics 1 English 8 Fine Arts 2 History 1 Mathematics 9 Nursing–Midwifery 2 Physician Assistant 26 Physics 12 Political Science 4 Psychology 3 Public Health 15 Sociology 22 Statistics 31 The U.S. News & World Report ranked Yale 3rd among U.S. national universities for 2016,[159] as it had for each of the previous sixteen years.

(March 2021) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Yale is a member of the Association of American Universities (AAU) and is classified among ""R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity"".[184] According to the National Science Foundation, Yale spent $990 million on research and development in 2018, ranking it 15th in the nation.[185] Yale's faculty include 61 members of the National Academy of Sciences,[186] 7 members of the National Academy of Engineering[187] and 49 members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. The college is, after normalization for institution size, the tenth-largest baccalaureate source of doctoral degree recipients in the United States, and the largest such source within the Ivy League.[188] Yale's English and Comparative Literature departments were part of the New Criticism movement. Of the New Critics, Robert Penn Warren, W.K. Wimsatt, and Cleanth Brooks were all Yale faculty. Later, the Yale Comparative literature department became a center of American deconstruction. Jacques Derrida, the father of deconstruction, taught at the Department of Comparative Literature from the late seventies to mid-1980s. Several other Yale faculty members were also associated with deconstruction, forming the so-called ""Yale School"". These included Paul de Man who taught in the Departments of Comparative Literature and French, J. Hillis Miller, Geoffrey Hartman (both taught in the Departments of English and Comparative Literature), and Harold Bloom (English), whose theoretical position was always somewhat specific, and who ultimately took a very different path from the rest of this group. Yale's history department has also originated important intellectual trends. Historians C. Vann Woodward and David Brion Davis are credited with beginning in the 1960s and 1970s an important stream of southern historians; likewise, David Montgomery, a labor historian, advised many of the current generation of labor historians in the country. Yale's Music School and Department fostered the growth of Music Theory in the latter half of the 20th century. The Journal of Music Theory was founded there in 1957; Allen Forte and David Lewin were influential teachers and scholars. In addition to eminent faculty members, Yale research relies heavily on the presence of roughly 1200 Postdocs from various national and international origin working in the multiple laboratories in the sciences, social sciences, humanities, and professional schools of the university. The university progressively recognized this working force with the recent creation of the Office for Postdoctoral Affairs and the Yale Postdoctoral Association. Campus life[edit] Yale is a research university, with the majority of its students in the graduate and professional schools. Undergraduates, or Yale College students, come from a variety of ethnic, national, socioeconomic, and personal backgrounds. Of the 2010–2011 freshman class, 10% are non‑U.S. citizens, while 54% went to public high schools.[189] The median family income of Yale students is $192,600, with 57% of students coming from the top 10% highest-earning families and 16% from the bottom 60%.[190] Residential colleges[edit] Main article: Residential colleges of Yale University Yale's residential college system was established in 1933 by Edward S. Harkness, who admired the social intimacy of Oxford and Cambridge and donated significant funds to found similar colleges at Yale and Harvard. Though Yale's colleges resemble their English precursors organizationally and architecturally, they are dependent entities of Yale College and have limited autonomy. The colleges are led by a head and an academic dean, who reside in the college, and university faculty and affiliates constitute each college's fellowship. Colleges offer their own seminars, social events, and speaking engagements known as ""Master's Teas,"" but do not contain programs of study or academic departments. All other undergraduate courses are taught by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and are open to members of any college. All undergraduates are members of a college, to which they are assigned before their freshman year, and 85 percent live in the college quadrangle or a college-affiliated dormitory.[191] While the majority of upperclassman live in the colleges, most on-campus freshmen live on the Old Campus, the university's oldest precinct. While Harkness' original colleges were Georgian Revival or Collegiate Gothic in style, two colleges constructed in the 1960s, Morse and Ezra Stiles Colleges, have modernist designs. All twelve college quadrangles are organized around a courtyard, and each has a dining hall, courtyard, library, common room, and a range of student facilities. The twelve colleges are named for important alumni or significant places in university history. In 2017, the university opened two new colleges near Science Hill.[192] Jonathan Edwards College courtyard Branford College courtyard Saybrook College's Killingworth Courtyard Hopper College courtyard Berkeley College buildings Trumbull College courtyard Davenport College courtyard Pierson College courtyard Silliman College courtyard Timothy Dwight College courtyard Morse College courtyard Ezra Stiles College courtyard Benjamin Franklin College courtyard Pauli Murray College courtyard Calhoun College[edit] Since the 1960s, John C. Calhoun's white supremacist beliefs and pro-slavery leadership[193][194][195][196] had prompted calls to rename the college or remove its tributes to Calhoun. The racially motivated church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina, led to renewed calls in the summer of 2015 for Calhoun College, one of 12 residential colleges, to be renamed. In July 2015 students signed a petition calling for the name change.[194] They argued in the petition that—while Calhoun was respected in the 19th century as an ""extraordinary American statesman""—he was ""one of the most prolific defenders of slavery and white supremacy"" in the history of the United States.[194][195] In August 2015 Yale President Peter Salovey addressed the Freshman Class of 2019 in which he responded to the racial tensions but explained why the college would not be renamed.[196] He described Calhoun as ""a notable political theorist, a vice president to two different U.S. presidents, a secretary of war and of state, and a congressman and senator representing South Carolina"".[196] He acknowledged that Calhoun also ""believed that the highest forms of civilization depend on involuntary servitude. Not only that, but he also believed that the races he thought to be inferior, black people in particular, ought to be subjected to it for the sake of their own best interests.""[193] Student activism about this issue increased in the fall of 2015, and included further protests sparked by controversy surrounding an administrator's comments on the potential positive and negative implications of students who wear Halloween costumes that are culturally sensitive.[197] Campus-wide discussions expanded to include critical discussion of the experiences of women of color on campus, and the realities of racism in undergraduate life.[198] The protests were sensationalized by the media and led to the labelling of some students as being members of Generation Snowflake.[199] In April 2016 Salovey announced that ""despite decades of vigorous alumni and student protests,"" Calhoun's name will remain on the Yale residential college[200] explaining that it is preferable for Yale students to live in Calhoun's ""shadow"" so they will be ""better prepared to rise to the challenges of the present and the future"". He claimed that if they removed Calhoun's name, it would ""obscure"" his ""legacy of slavery rather than addressing it"".[200] ""Yale is part of that history"" and ""We cannot erase American history, but we can confront it, teach it and learn from it."" One change that will be issued is the title of ""master"" for faculty members who serve as residential college leaders will be renamed to ""head of college"" due to its connotation of slavery.[201] Despite this apparently conclusive reasoning, Salovey announced that Calhoun College would be renamed for groundbreaking computer scientist Grace Murray Hopper in February 2017.[202] This renaming decision received a range of responses from Yale students and alumni.[203][204][205] Student organizations[edit] In 2014, Yale had 385 registered student organizations, plus an additional one hundred groups in the process of registration.[206] The university hosts a variety of student journals, magazines, and newspapers. Established in 1872, The Yale Record is the world's oldest humor magazine. Newspapers include the Yale Daily News, which was first published in 1878, and the weekly Yale Herald, which was first published in 1986. The Yale Journal of Medicine & Law is a biannual magazine that explores the intersection of law and medicine. Dwight Hall, an independent, non-profit community service organization, oversees more than 2,000 Yale undergraduates working on more than 70 community service initiatives in New Haven. The Yale College Council runs several agencies that oversee campus wide activities and student services. The Yale Dramatic Association and Bulldog Productions cater to the theater and film communities, respectively. In addition, the Yale Drama Coalition[207] serves to coordinate between and provide resources for the various Sudler Fund sponsored theater productions which run each weekend. WYBC Yale Radio[208] is the campus's radio station, owned and operated by students. While students used to broadcast on AM and FM frequencies, they now have an Internet-only stream. The Yale College Council (YCC) serves as the campus's undergraduate student government. All registered student organizations are regulated and funded by a subsidiary organization of the YCC, known as the Undergraduate Organizations Funding Committee (UOFC).[209] The Graduate and Professional Student Senate (GPSS) serves as Yale's graduate and professional student government. The Yale Political Union is advised by alumni political leaders such as John Kerry and George Pataki. The Yale International Relations Association (YIRA) functions as the umbrella organization for the top-ranked Model UN team. YIRA also has a Europe-based offshoot, Yale Model Government Europe, other Model UN conferences such as YMUN Korea or YMUN Taiwan, and educational programs such as the Yale Review of International Relations (YRIS), YMUN Institute, or Hemispheres. The campus includes several fraternities and sororities. The campus features at least 18 a cappella groups, the most famous of which is The Whiffenpoofs, which from its founding in 1909 until 2018 was made up solely of senior men. Yale's secret societies include Skull and Bones, Scroll and Key, Wolf's Head, Book and Snake, Elihu, Berzelius, St. Elmo, Manuscript, Shabtai, Myth and Sword, Mace and Chain and Sage and Chalice. The two oldest existing honor societies are the Aurelian (1910) and the Torch Honor Society (1916).[210] The Elizabethan Club, a social club, has a membership of undergraduates, graduates, faculty and staff with literary or artistic interests. Membership is by invitation. Members and their guests may enter the ""Lizzie's"" premises for conversation and tea. The club owns first editions of a Shakespeare Folio, several Shakespeare Quartos, and a first edition of Milton's Paradise Lost, among other important literary texts. Traditions[edit] See also: Bladderball Yale seniors at graduation smash clay pipes underfoot to symbolize passage from their ""bright college years,"" though in recent history the pipes have been replaced with ""bubble pipes"".[211][212] (""Bright College Years,"" the university's alma mater, was penned in 1881 by Henry Durand, Class of 1881, to the tune of Die Wacht am Rhein.) Yale's student tour guides tell visitors that students consider it good luck to rub the toe of the statue of Theodore Dwight Woolsey on Old Campus; however, actual students rarely do so.[213] In the second half of the 20th century Bladderball, a campus-wide game played with a large inflatable ball, became a popular tradition but was banned by administration due to safety concerns. In spite of administration opposition, students revived the game in 2009, 2011, and 2014.[214][215][216] Athletic[edit] Main article: Yale Bulldogs The Yale Bowl, the college football stadium located near Yale University Yale supports 35 varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference, the Eastern College Athletic Conference, the New England Intercollegiate Sailing Association. Yale athletic teams compete intercollegiately at the NCAA Division I level. Like other members of the Ivy League, Yale does not offer athletic scholarships. Yale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Yale Bowl (the nation's first natural ""bowl"" stadium, and prototype for such stadiums as the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and the Rose Bowl), located at The Walter Camp Field athletic complex, and the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, the second-largest indoor athletic complex in the world.[217] In May 2018, the men's lacrosse team defeated the Duke Blue Devils to claim their first ever NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship,[218] and are the first Ivy League school to win the title since the Princeton Tigers in 2001.[219] In 2016, the men's basketball team won the Ivy League Championship title for the first time in 54 years, earning a spot in the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. In the first round of the tournament, the Bulldogs beat the Baylor Bears 79–75 in the school's first-ever tournament win.[220] The Walter Camp Gate at the Yale Athletic Complex October 21, 2000, marked the dedication of Yale's fourth new boathouse in 157 years of collegiate rowing. The Gilder Boathouse is named to honor former Olympic rower Virginia Gilder '79 and her father Richard Gilder '54, who gave $4 million towards the $7.5 million project. Yale also maintains the Gales Ferry site where the heavyweight men's team trains for the Yale-Harvard Boat Race. Yale crew is the oldest collegiate athletic team in America, and won Olympic Games Gold Medal for men's eights in 1924 and 1956. The Yale Corinthian Yacht Club, founded in 1881, is the oldest collegiate sailing club in the world. In 1896, Yale and Johns Hopkins played the first known ice hockey game in the United States. Since 2006, the school's ice hockey clubs have played a commemorative game.[221] Yale students claim to have invented Frisbee, by tossing empty Frisbie Pie Company tins.[222][223] Yale athletics are supported by the Yale Precision Marching Band. ""Precision"" is used here ironically; the band is a scatter-style band that runs wildly between formations rather than actually marching.[224] The band attends every home football game and many away, as well as most hockey and basketball games throughout the winter. Yale intramural sports are also a significant aspect of student life. Students compete for their respective residential colleges, fostering a friendly rivalry. The year is divided into fall, winter, and spring seasons, each of which includes about ten different sports. About half the sports are coeducational. At the end of the year, the residential college with the most points (not all sports count equally) wins the Tyng Cup. Song[edit] Notable among the songs commonly played and sung at events such as commencement, convocation, alumni gatherings, and athletic games are the alma mater, ""Bright College Years"". Despite its popularity, ""Boola Boola"" is not the official fight song, albeit being the origin of the university's unofficial motto. The official Yale fight song, ""Bulldog"" was written by Cole Porter during his undergraduate days and is sung after touchdowns during a football game.[225] Additionally, two other songs, ""Down the Field"" by C.W. O'Conner, and ""Bingo Eli Yale"", also by Cole Porter, are still sung at football games. According to College Fight Songs: An Annotated Anthology published in 1998, ""Down the Field"" ranks as the fourth-greatest fight song of all time.[226] Mascot[edit] The school mascot is ""Handsome Dan,"" the Yale bulldog, and the Yale fight song contains the refrain, ""Bulldog, bulldog, bow wow wow"". The school color, since 1894, is Yale Blue.[227] Yale's Handsome Dan is believed to be the first college mascot in America, having been established in 1889.[228] Notable people[edit] Benefactors[edit] Yale has had many financial supporters, but some stand out by the magnitude or timeliness of their contributions. Among those who have made large donations commemorated at the university are: Elihu Yale; Jeremiah Dummer; the Harkness family (Edward, Anna, and William); the Beinecke family (Edwin, Frederick, and Walter); John William Sterling; Payne Whitney; Joseph Earl Sheffield, Paul Mellon, Charles B. G. Murphy, Joseph Tsai, and William K. Lanman. The Yale Class of 1954, led by Richard Gilder, donated $70 million in commemoration of their 50th reunion.[229] Charles B. Johnson, a 1954 graduate of Yale College, pledged a $250 million gift in 2013 to support the construction of two new residential colleges.[230] The colleges have been named respectively in honor of Pauli Murray and Benjamin Franklin. A $100 million contribution[231] by Stephen Adams enabled the Yale School of Music to become tuition-free and the Adams Center for Musical Arts to be built.

Scott Fitzgerald's novel The Great Gatsby. The narrator, Nick Carraway, wrote a series of editorials for the Yale News, and Tom Buchanan was ""one of the most powerful ends that ever played football"" for Yale. In the popular TV show The Simpsons, Mr. Burns is a Yale alumnus. References[edit] ^ a b ""Yale University Financial Report 2019-2020"" (PDF). Yale University. 2020.

So-called “public Ivies” such as University of Michigan and Berkeley were not considered elite or even prestigious in the minds of evaluators (in contrast, these “state schools” were frequently described pejoratively as “safety schools” that were “just okay”). Even Ivy League designation was insufficient for inclusion in the super-elite. For undergraduate institutions, “top-tier” typically included only Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Stanford, and potentially Wharton (University of Pennsylvania’s Business School). By contrast, Brown, Cornell, Dartmouth, and University of Pennsylvania (general studies) were frequently described as “second tier” schools that were filled primarily with candidates who “didn’t get in” to a super-elite school.

81,"Analysis unlocks secret of the Vinland Map — it’s a fake | YaleNews Skip to main content calendar subscribe Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Feeds YaleNews Explore Topics Alumni Arts & Humanities Business Campus & Community Environment Health & Medicine International Law Science & Technology Social Sciences In Focus In Memoriam Search form Search Analysis unlocks secret of the Vinland Map — it’s a fakeBy Mike CummingsSeptember 1, 2021 Share this with Facebook Share this with Twitter Share this with LinkedIn Share this with Email Print this The Vinland Map, which purports to be a 15th-century map with a pre-Columbian depiction of the North American Coast, was drawn with modern inks, suggests a new analysis by Yale scientists and conservators. The Vinland Map, once hailed as the earliest depiction of the New World, is awash in 20th-century ink. A team of conservators and conservation scientists at Yale has found compelling new evidence for this conclusion through the most thorough analysis yet performed on the infamous parchment map. Acquired by Yale in the mid-1960s, the purported 15th-century map depicts a pre-Columbian “Vinlanda Insula,” a section of North America’s coastline southwest of Greenland. While earlier studies had detected evidence of modern inks at various points on the map, the new Yale analysis examined the entire document’s elemental composition using state-of-the-art tools and techniques that were previously unavailable. The analysis revealed that a titanium compound used in inks first produced in the 1920s pervades the map’s lines and text. “The Vinland Map is a fake,” said Raymond Clemens, curator of early books and manuscripts at Yale’s Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library, which houses the map. “There is no reasonable doubt here. This new analysis should put the matter to rest.” The new study also uncovered evidence that the map deception was intentional. A Latin inscription on its back, possibly a bookbinder’s note guiding the assembly of the Speculum Historiale — an authentic medieval volume and the likely source of the map’s calfskin parchment — is overwritten with modern ink to appear like instructions for binding the map within the genuine 15th-century manuscript. An inscription on the back of the map (top), possibly a bookbinder’s note for assembling the medieval volume with which it was originally bound, was overwritten in an apparent attempt to deceive. The bottom image shows the presence of titanium in the ink, which strongly suggests it is of modern origin, while the preceding three false-color images highlight elements that are consistent with medieval iron gall ink. “The altered inscription certainly seems like an attempt to make people believe the map was created at the same time as the Speculum Historiale,” Clemens said. “It’s powerful evidence that this is a forgery, not an innocent creation by a third party that was co-opted by someone else, although it doesn’t tell us who perpetrated the deception.” Yale created a sensation in 1965 when it announced the Vinland Map’s existence and published a scholarly book about it by Yale librarians and curators at the British Museum in London. Its discovery seemed to demonstrate that Norsemen were the first Europeans to reach the New World, landing in the Americas well before Columbus’ first voyage. (Archeological discoveries at L’Anse aux Meadows in Newfoundland during the 1960s confirmed that the Vikings had built settlements in the Americas long before Columbus sailed.) From the beginning, however, scholars began to question the map’s authenticity. And over time an overwhelming consensus has emerged that it is indeed a 20th-century forgery. An in-house study The map has been subjected to multiple analyses over the years. A 1973 study by the McCrone Research Institute in Chicago found that its ink contains anatase, a form of titanium dioxide first used commercially in the 1920s. The most recent examination of the full map prior to the new Yale study was conducted by Danish scientists, who in 2004 measured its color, thickness, flexibility, and transparency while assessing damage to its parchment. This latest analysis provides the clearest evidence yet that the map is a fraud. Macro X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) revealed the presence of titanium throughout the map’s lines and text. Previous analyses showed titanium in specific points on the map. This new study demonstrated that it pervades the entire map.The examination paired Yale University Library conservators Marie-France Lemay and Paula Zyats — experts in the materials and physical structures of early books and manuscripts — with a team of scientists at the Institute for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage on Yale’s West Campus. That team included Anikó Bezur, the Wallace S. Wilson Director of the Technical Studies Laboratory; Richard Hark, a conservation scientist who works with the Beinecke Library’s collections; and Pablo Londero, now senior conservation scientist at Louvre Abu Dhabi. Unlike the previous studies, the Yale team had unfettered access to the map and its accompanying manuscripts for as long as their work required. They also had the time and space to consult closely with Clemens and each other on the specific questions that they wanted to answer, said Bezur. It also allowed the researchers for the first time to systematically examine the map alongside the two medieval texts with which it was originally bound. One is the Speculum Historiale, a popular four-volume medieval encyclopedia by Vincent de Beauvais. Yale possesses a copy of a portion of the work’s third volume, which is dated to the Council of Basel, a general council of the Roman Catholic Church that took place between 1431 and 1449 in Switzerland. The other manuscript, the Hystoria Tartorum, or Tartar Relation, is an account of a journey by two Polish clerics into the lands of Genghis Khan in mid-1200s. “Studying the three objects together is important to learning their full story,” said Zyats, head of rare books conservation for the Yale Library. Matching wormhole patterns indicated that the map was originally located at the front of the Speculum Historiale and was likely drawn on one of the volume’s end sheets, Zyats said. But when the map arrived at Yale, it was bound inside the slim copy of the Tartar Relation, which had a modern binding. The university subsequently acquired the Speculum Historiale. Radiocarbon dating performed on both manuscripts in 2018 showed that their parchment and paper date approximately from 1400 to 1460, which correlates with prior carbon-dating done on the map. A watermark on a paper leaf of the Speculum Historiale is traceable to a papermill that operated in Basel during the 1440s, corroborating the theory that the two manuscripts were made during the Council of Basel, Zyats explained. Also, the text in both manuscripts is written in a similar style, likely by the same scribe. The recent discovery of a 14th-century copy of the complete Speculum Historiale in Lucerne, Switzerland that had a copy of the Tartar Relation bound in its last volume shows there is historical precedent for combining the two manuscripts, Zyats said. (The Lucerne copy of the Tartar Relation joins Yale’s copy as the only two known to exist.) ‘The big picture’ About the size of a placemat, the Vinland Map lacks the elaborate ornamentation of other medieval maps, such as the Beinecke Library’s collection of portolan nautical charts. Patched wormholes dot its parchment. Much of its ink appears faded. A scanning x-ray fluorescence spectrometer hovers over the map. The instrument created elemental maps revealing the distribution of elements throughout the map.The members of the Yale team focused their attention on the ink used in the map. Using X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF), a non-destructive technique, they identified the distribution of elements throughout the map. While scientists for decades have used XRF to study the elemental composition of specific points on an object, Bezur said, only recently have they been able to use it to scan an entire two-dimensional object in a laboratory setting. “With macro-XRF, we can generate a one-to-one scale elemental map of the map,” Bezur said. “That’s huge because it allows us to share a full dataset of the entire map. We’re not picking and choosing individual points. We’re offering the big picture.” Medieval scribes typically wrote with iron gall ink, which is composed of iron sulphate, powdered gall nuts, and a binder (the first two are primary elemental ingredients of iron gall ink, and the third is often present as an impurity). The XRF analysis of the Vinland Map showed little to no iron, sulfur, or copper. Instead, the scan revealed the presence of titanium throughout the map’s ink. A scan of Vinlanda Insula, the portion of North American coastline that made the map famous, revealed high levels of titanium and smaller amounts of barium — a key revelation as the earliest commercially produced titanium-white pigments in the 1920s contained titanium dioxide and barium sulfate. Having mapped the distribution of elements, the team used Raman microscopy, a type of molecular microscopy, to confirm that the titanium dioxide in the map’s ink is in the form of anatase. While an earlier study had utilized Raman microscopy in analyzing nine points on the map, the new study found that anatase is broadly distributed on the document. With help from Marcie Wiggins, assistant conservation scientist at IPCH, the team analyzed the inks in 50 manuscript fragments in the Beinecke Library’s collection that were produced in Central Europe during the 15th century, approximately when the Vinland Map was supposedly drawn. They found that the fragments contain far lower levels of titanium than the map and much higher levels of iron. Infrared light exposed altered text in the Tartar Relation, the authentic medieval manuscript that the map was bound with when it arrived at Yale. Analysis showed the altered text is composed of modern ink. To confirm that the map’s ink was of modern origin, and that the anatase wasn’t simply unique and naturally occurring, the team performed field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) on samples from the altered text of the Tartar Relation and the map. This process yielded highly magnified images of its ink’s components, which showed that the anatase particles closely resemble those found in pigment that was commercially produced in Norway in 1923. Nothing suggested that the anatase was naturally sourced, Hark said. Having determined that the ink’s composition was consistent with an early form of commercially available titanium white, the team spotted evidence that the map is a deliberate forgery. The original Latin inscription on the reverse side of the map, written in iron gall ink, translates to “second part of the third part of the Speculum.” It could be a bookbinder’s note on assembling the Speculum Historiale, which is a massive work containing 32 sections that are usually bound in four volumes. But in this case, the inscription was overwritten in a titanium-containing ink to roughly translate to “drawing first-part, second-part of the third part of the Speculum.” Yale’s copy of the Speculum Historiale consists of books 21 to 24, which is the second half of the encyclopedia’s third volume, Hark explained. “I think that constitutes pretty strong evidence of a motive to deceive — to make the map look like something it is not,” Hark said. ‘A historical object’ The team members plan to describe their work and findings in scholarly articles. For his part, Clemens hopes to publish an article in a leading cartography journal that definitively shows the map for what it is: a fake. “Objects like the Vinland Map soak up a lot of intellectual air space,” Clemens said. “We don’t want this to continue to be a controversy. There are so many fun and fascinating things that we ought to be examining that can actually tell us something about exploration and travel in the medieval world.” The analysis demonstrates the value of the expertise and resources provided by the Yale Library’s Center for Preservation and Conservation and IPCH, which enable the in-house analysis of materials in the university’s collections and those being considered for acquisition, he said. Hark, Lemay, and Wiggins are currently working on a project with the Morgan Library in Manhattan to analyze the Visconti Tarot, lavishly hand-painted tarot cards decorated with gold and silver foil that were created in Italy in the mid-15th century. They are among the earliest sets of tarot cards known to exist. The Beinecke and Morgan both house decks of the cards, whose authenticity is not in doubt. The researchers hope to learn more about how they were made. As for the Vinland Map, it will remain at the Beinecke with the accompanying manuscripts, Clemens said. “The map has become an historical object in and of itself,” he said. “It’s a great example of a forgery that had an international impact and it’s an integral part of the Speculum Historiale, which is a genuinely fascinating manuscript.” Arts & HumanitiesScience & Technology Share this with Facebook Share this with Twitter Share this with LinkedIn Share this with Email Print this Media ContactBess Connolly : elizabeth.connolly@yale.edu, More News Yale to partner in new NSF quantum simulation institute In the immune arsenal, antibodies offer best long-term hope against COVID The social cost of carbon is still the best way to evaluate climate policy In a first, randomized study shows that masks reduce COVID-19 infections Show More Articles Yale Browse Archives Contact Us For the Media It’s Your Yale Apply to Yale Give to Yale Managed by the  Office of Public Affairs & Communications Copyright © 2021 Yale University · All rights reserved · Privacy policy · Accessibility at Yale Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Feeds Yale on Instagram",Yale University

It is located on New Haven Harbor on the northern shore of Long Island Sound in New Haven County, Connecticut, and is part of the New Haven metropolitan area. With a population of 134,023 as determined by the 2020 United States Census,[3] New Haven is now the third-largest city in Connecticut after Bridgeport, and Stamford. New Haven is the principal municipality of Greater New Haven, which had a total population of 864,835 as of 2020.[4] New Haven was one of the first planned cities in America.[5][6][7] A year after its founding by English Puritans in 1638, eight streets were laid out in a four-by-four grid, creating what is commonly known as the ""Nine Square Plan"".[8] The central common block is the New Haven Green, a 16-acre (6 ha) square at the center of Downtown New Haven. The Green is now a National Historic Landmark, and the ""Nine Square Plan"" is recognized by the American Planning Association as a National Planning Landmark.[9][10] New Haven is the home of Yale University. As New Haven's biggest taxpayer and employer,[11] Yale serves as an integral part of the city's economy. Health care (hospitals and biotechnology), professional services (legal, architectural, marketing, and engineering), financial services, and retail trade also contribute to the city's economic activity. The city served as co-capital of Connecticut from 1701 until 1873, when sole governance was transferred to the more centrally located city of Hartford. New Haven has since billed itself as the ""Cultural Capital of Connecticut"" for its supply of established theaters, museums, and music venues.[12] New Haven had the first public tree planting program in America, producing a canopy of mature trees (including some large elms) that gave the city the nickname ""The Elm City"".[13] Contents 1 History 1.1 Pre-colonial foundation as an independent colony 1.2 As part of the Connecticut Colony 1.3 Post-colonial period and industrialization 1.4 Post-industrial era and urban redevelopment 1.5 Timeline of notable firsts 2 Geography 2.1 Climate 2.2 Streetscape 2.3 Neighborhoods 3 Demographics 3.1 Census data 3.2 Other data 4 Economy 4.1 Headquarters 5 Law and Government 5.1 Political structure 5.2 Political history 5.3 Crime 6 Education 6.1 Colleges and universities 6.2 Primary and secondary schools 7 Culture 7.1 Cuisine 7.2 Theatre and film 7.3 Museums 7.4 Music 7.5 Festivals 7.6 Nightlife 7.7 Newspapers and media 7.8 Sports and athletics 8 Structures 8.1 Architecture 8.2 Historic points of interest 9 Transportation 9.1 Rail 9.2 Bus 9.3 Bicycle 9.3.1 Bikeshare 9.3.2 Bike lanes 9.3.3 Farmington Canal Greenway 9.4 Roads 9.5 Airport 9.6 Seaport 10 Infrastructure 10.1 Hospitals and medicine 10.2 Power supply facilities 11 In popular culture 12 Notable people 13 Sister cities 14 See also 15 References 16 Further reading 17 External links History[edit] Pre-colonial foundation as an independent colony[edit] Before Europeans arrived, the New Haven area was the home of the Quinnipiac tribe of Native Americans, who lived in villages around the harbor and subsisted off local fisheries and the farming of maize. The area was briefly visited by Dutch explorer Adriaen Block in 1614. Dutch traders set up a small trading system of beaver pelts with the local inhabitants, but trade was sporadic and the Dutch did not settle permanently in the area. The 1638 nine-square plan, with the extant New Haven Green at its center, continues to define New Haven's downtown In 1637 a small party of Puritans reconnoitered the New Haven harbor area and wintered over. In April 1638, the main party of five hundred Puritans who had left the Massachusetts Bay Colony under the leadership of Reverend John Davenport and London merchant Theophilus Eaton sailed into the harbor. It was their hope to set up a theological community with the government more closely linked to the church than that in Massachusetts, and to exploit the area's excellent potential as a port. The Quinnipiacs, who were under attack by neighboring Pequots, sold their land to the settlers in return for protection. Wikisource has original text related to this article: Government of New Haven Colony House of New Haven Founder Theophilus Eaton as it stood at Orange and Elm streets in the 17th Century By 1640, ""Quinnipiac's"" theocratic government and nine-square grid plan were in place, and the town was renamed Newhaven, with 'haven' meaning harbor or port. (However, the area to the north remained Quinnipiac until 1678, when it was renamed Hamden.) The settlement became the headquarters of the New Haven Colony, distinct from the Connecticut Colony previously established to the north centering on Hartford. Reflecting its theocratic roots, the New Haven Colony forbid the establishment of other churches, whereas the Connecticut Colony permitted them. Economic disaster struck Newhaven in 1646, when the town sent its first fully loaded ship of local goods (the ""Great Shippe"") back to England. It never reached its destination, and its disappearance stymied New Haven's development versus the rising trade powers of Boston and New Amsterdam. In 1660, Colony founder John Davenport's wishes were fulfilled, and Hopkins School was founded in New Haven with money from the estate of Edward Hopkins. In 1661, the Regicides who had signed the death warrant of Charles I of England were pursued by Charles II. Two of them, Colonel Edward Whalley and Colonel William Goffe, fled to New Haven for refuge. Davenport arranged for them to hide in the West Rock hills northwest of the town. Later a third judge, John Dixwell, joined the others. As part of the Connecticut Colony[edit] New Haven as it appeared in a 1786 engraving Second meeting house on the New Haven Green, as it stood from 1670 to 1757 In 1664 New Haven became part of the Connecticut Colony when the two colonies were merged under political pressure from England. Some members of the New Haven Colony seeking to establish a new theocracy elsewhere went on to establish Newark, New Jersey. It was made co-capital of Connecticut in 1701, a status it retained until 1873. In 1716, the Collegiate School relocated from Old Saybrook to New Haven, establishing New Haven as a center of learning. In 1718, in response to a large donation from East India Company merchant Elihu Yale, former Governor of Madras, the name of the Collegiate School was changed to Yale College.[14] For over a century, New Haven citizens had fought in the colonial militia alongside regular British forces, as in the French and Indian War. As the American Revolution approached, General David Wooster and other influential residents hoped that the conflict with the government in Britain could be resolved short of rebellion. On 23 April 1775, which is still celebrated in New Haven as Powder House Day, the Second Company, Governor's Foot Guard, of New Haven entered the struggle against the British parliament. Under Captain Benedict Arnold, they broke into the powder house to arm themselves and began a three-day march to Cambridge, Massachusetts. Other New Haven militia members were on hand to escort George Washington from his overnight stay in New Haven on his way to Cambridge. Contemporary reports, from both sides, remark on the New Haven volunteers' professional military bearing, including uniforms. On July 5, 1779, 2,600 loyalists and British regulars under General William Tryon, governor of New York, landed in New Haven Harbor and raided the 3,500-person town. A militia of Yale students had been preparing for battle, and former Yale president and Yale Divinity School professor Naphtali Daggett rode out to confront the Redcoats. Yale president Ezra Stiles recounted in his diary that while he moved furniture in anticipation of battle, he still couldn't quite believe the revolution had begun.[15] New Haven was not torched as the invaders did with Danbury in 1777, or Fairfield and Norwalk a week after the New Haven raid, so many of the town's colonial features were preserved. Post-colonial period and industrialization[edit] New Haven was incorporated as a city in 1784, and Roger Sherman, one of the signers of the Constitution and author of the ""Connecticut Compromise"", became the new city's first mayor.

That area is still known as Whitneyville, and the main road through both towns is known as Whitney Avenue. The factory is now the Eli Whitney Museum, which has a particular emphasis on activities for children and exhibits pertaining to the A. C. Gilbert Company. His factory, along with that of Simeon North, and the lively clock-making and brass hardware sectors, contributed to making early Connecticut a powerful manufacturing economy; so many arms manufacturers sprang up that the state became known as ""The Arsenal of America"". It was in Whitney's gun-manufacturing plant that Samuel Colt invented the automatic revolver in 1836. Many other talented machinists and firearms designers would go on to found successful firearms manufacturing companies in New Haven, including Oliver Winchester and O.F. Mossberg & Sons. The Farmington Canal, created in the early 19th century, was a short-lived transporter of goods into the interior regions of Connecticut and Massachusetts, and ran from New Haven to Northampton, Massachusetts. New Haven was home to one of the important early events in the burgeoning anti-slavery movement when, in 1839, the trial of mutineering Mende tribesmen being transported as slaves on the Spanish slaveship Amistad was held in New Haven's United States District Court.[17] There is a statue of Joseph Cinqué, the informal leader of the slaves, beside City Hall. See ""Museums"" below for more information. Abraham Lincoln delivered a speech on slavery in New Haven in 1860,[18] shortly before he secured the Republican nomination for President. The American Civil War boosted the local economy with wartime purchases of industrial goods, including that of the New Haven Arms Company, which would later become the Winchester Repeating Arms Company. (Winchester would continue to produce arms in New Haven until 2006, and many of the buildings that were a part of the Winchester plant are now a part of the Winchester Repeating Arms Company Historic District).[19] After the war, population grew and doubled by the start of the 20th century, most notably due to the influx of immigrants from southern Europe, particularly Italy. Today, roughly half the populations of East Haven, West Haven, and North Haven are Italian-American. Jewish immigration to New Haven has left an enduring mark on the city. Westville was the center of Jewish life in New Haven, though today many have fanned out to suburban communities such as Woodbridge and Cheshire. Post-industrial era and urban redevelopment[edit] New Haven's expansion continued during the two World Wars, with most new inhabitants being African Americans from the American South and Puerto Ricans. The city reached its peak population after World War II. The area of New Haven is only 17 square miles (44 km2), encouraging further development of new housing after 1950 in adjacent, suburban towns. Moreover, as in other U.S. cities in the 1950s, New Haven began to suffer white flight of middle-class workers. One author suggested that aggressive redlining and rezoning made it difficult for residents to obtain financing for older, deteriorating urban housing stock, thereby condemning such structures to deterioration.[20][additional citation(s) needed] In 1954; then-mayor Richard C. Lee began some of the earliest major urban renewal projects in the United States. Certain sections of downtown New Haven were redeveloped to include museums, new office towers, a hotel, and large shopping complexes.[21] Other parts of the city, particularly the Wooster Square and Fair Haven neighborhoods were affected by the construction of Interstate 95 along the Long Wharf section, Interstate 91, and the Oak Street Connector. The Oak Street Connector (Route 34), running between Interstate 95, downtown, and The Hill neighborhood, was originally intended as a highway to the city's western suburbs but was only completed as a highway to the downtown area, with the area to the west becoming a boulevard (See ""Redevelopment"" below). In 1970, a series of criminal prosecutions against various members of the Black Panther Party took place in New Haven, inciting mass protests on the New Haven Green involving twelve thousand demonstrators and many well-known New Left political activists. (See ""Political Culture"" below for more information). From the 1960s through the late 1990s, central areas of New Haven continued to decline both economically and in terms of population despite attempts to resurrect certain neighborhoods through renewal projects. In conjunction with its declining population, New Haven experienced a steep rise in its crime rate. Since approximately 2000, many parts of downtown New Haven have been revitalized with new restaurants, nightlife, and small retail stores. In particular, the area surrounding the New Haven Green has experienced an influx of apartments and condominiums. In recent years, downtown retail options have increased with the opening of new stores such as Urban Oufitters, J Crew, Origins, American Apparel, Gant Clothing, and an Apple Store, joining older stores such as Barnes & Noble and Raggs Clothing. In addition, two new supermarkets opened to serve downtown's growing residential population. A Stop & Shop opened just west of downtown, while Elm City Market, located one block from the Green, opened in 2011.[22] The recent turnaround of downtown New Haven has received positive press from various periodicals.[23][24][25] Major projects include the current construction of a new campus for Gateway Community College downtown, and also a 32-story, 500-unit apartment/retail building called 360 State Street. The 360 State Street project is now occupied and is the largest residential building in Connecticut.[26] A new boathouse and dock is planned for New Haven Harbor, and the linear park Farmington Canal Trail is set to extend into downtown New Haven within the coming year.[27] Additionally, foundation and ramp work to widen I-95 to create a new harbor crossing for New Haven, with an extradosed bridge to replace the 1950s-era Q Bridge, has begun.[28] The city still hopes to redevelop the site of the New Haven Coliseum, which was demolished in 2007. In April 2009, the United States Supreme Court agreed to hear a suit over reverse discrimination brought by 18 white firefighters against the city. The suit involved the 2003 promotion test for the New Haven Fire Department. After the tests were scored, no black firefighters scored high enough to qualify for consideration for promotion, so the city announced that no one would be promoted. In the subsequent Ricci v. DeStefano decision the court found 5-4 that New Haven's decision to ignore the test results violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.[29] As a result, a district court subsequently ordered the city to promote 14 of the white firefighters.[30] In 2010 and 2011, state and federal funds were awarded to Connecticut (and Massachusetts) to construct the Hartford Line, with a southern terminus at New Haven's Union Station and a northern terminus at Springfield's Union Station.[31] According to the White House, ""This corridor [currently] has one train per day connecting communities in Connecticut and Massachusetts to the Northeast Corridor and Vermont. The vision for this corridor is to restore the alignment to its original route via the Knowledge Corridor in western Massachusetts, improving trip time and increasing the population base that can be served.""[32] Set for construction in 2013, the ""Knowledge Corridor high speed intercity passenger rail"" project will cost approximately $1 billion, and the ultimate northern terminus for the project is reported to be Montreal in Canada.[33] Train speeds between will reportedly exceed 110 miles per hour (180 km/h) and increase both cities' rail traffic exponentially.[34] Timeline of notable firsts[edit] See also: Yale – New Haven Hospital § Milestones in medicine 1638: New Haven becomes the first planned city in America. 1776: Yale student David Bushnell invents the first American submarine. 1787: John Fitch builds the first steamboat. 1793: Eli Whitney invents the cotton gin. 1836: Samuel Colt invents the automatic revolver in Whitney's factory. 1839: Charles Goodyear of New Haven discovers the process of vulcanizing rubber in Woburn, Massachusetts, and later perfects it and patents the process in nearby Springfield, Massachusetts.[35] 1860: Philios P. Blake patents the first corkscrew. 1877: New Haven hosts the first Bell PSTN (telephone) switch office. 1878–1880: The District Telephone Company of New Haven creates the world's first telephone exchange and the first telephone directory and installs the first public phone. The company expanded and became the Connecticut Telephone Company, then the Southern New England Telephone Company (now part of AT&T).[36] 1882: The Knights of Columbus are founded in New Haven. The city still serves as the world headquarters of the organization, which maintains a museum downtown.[37] 1892: Local confectioner George C. Smith of the Bradley Smith Candy Co. invents the first lollipops.[38] Late 19th century-early 20th century: The first public tree planting program takes place in New Haven, at the urging of native James Hillhouse.[39] 1900: Louis Lassen, owner of Louis' Lunch, is credited with inventing the hamburger, as well as the steak sandwich.[40] 1911: The Erector Set, the popular and culturally important construction toy, is invented in New Haven by A.C. Gilbert. It was manufactured by the A. C. Gilbert Company at Erector Square from 1913 until the company's bankruptcy in 1967.[41] 1920: In competition with competing explanations, the Frisbee is said to have originated on the Yale campus, based on the tin pans of the Frisbie Pie Company which were tossed around by students on the New Haven Green.[42] 1977: The first memorial to victims of the Holocaust on public land in America[43] stands in New Haven's Edgewood Park at the corner of Whalley and West Park avenues. It was built with funds collected from the community[44] and is maintained by Greater New Haven Holocaust Memory, Inc.[45] The ashes of victims killed and cremated at Auschwitz are buried under the memorial.[43] Geography[edit] View of the Quinnipiac River from Fair HavenAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 20.1 square miles (52.1 km2), of which 18.7 square miles (48.4 km2) is land and 1.4 square miles (3.7 km2), or 6.67%, is water.[46] New Haven's best-known geographic features are its large, shallow harbor, and two reddish basalt trap rock ridges which rise to the northeast and northwest of the city core. These trap rocks are known respectively as East Rock and West Rock, and both serve as extensive parks. West Rock has been tunneled through to make way for the east–west passage of the Wilbur Cross Parkway (the only highway tunnel through a natural obstacle in Connecticut), and once served as the hideout of the ""Regicides"" (see: Regicides Trail). Most New Haveners refer to these men as ""The Three Judges"". East Rock features the prominent Soldiers and Sailors war monument on its peak as well as the ""Great/Giant Steps"" which run up the rock's cliffside. The city is drained by three rivers; the West, Mill, and Quinnipiac, named in order from west to east. The West River discharges into West Haven Harbor, while the Mill and Quinnipiac rivers discharge into New Haven Harbor. Both harbors are embayments of Long Island Sound. In addition, several smaller streams flow through the city's neighborhoods, including Wintergreen Brook, the Beaver Ponds Outlet, Wilmot Brook, Belden Brook, and Prospect Creek. Not all of these small streams have continuous flow year-round. Climate[edit] According to the Köppen classification, New Haven is cfa, or a Temperate climate. The city has hot, humid summers and cool to cold winters. From May to late September, the weather is typically hot and humid, with average temperatures exceeding 80 °F (27 °C) on 70 days per year. In summer, the Bermuda High creates as southern flow of warm and humid air, with frequent thundershowers. October to early December is normally mild to cool late in the season, while early spring (April) can be cool to warm. Winters are moderately cold with both rain and snow fall. The weather patterns that affect New Haven result from a primarily offshore direction, thus reducing the marine influence of Long Island Sound—although, like other marine areas, differences in temperature between areas right along the coastline and areas a mile or two inland can be large at times. During summer heat waves, temperatures may reach 95 °F (35 °C) or higher on occasion with heat-index values of over 100 °F (38 °C). Tropical cyclones have struck New Haven in the past, including 1938 Hurricane (Long Island Express), Hurricane Carol in 1954, Hurricane Gloria in 1985.[citation needed] Climate data for New Haven (HVN), elevation: 4 m or 13 ft, 1991–2020 normals, extremes 1948–present Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °F (°C) 69(21) 67(19) 77(25) 87(31) 92(33) 96(36) 101(38) 100(38) 82(28) 89(32) 76(24) 65(18) 101(38) Mean maximum °F (°C) 56(13) 55(13) 64(18) 77(25) 83(28) 88(31) 91(33) 90(32) 86(30) 78(26) 68(20) 59(15) 92(33) Average high °F (°C) 38.1(3.4) 40.2(4.6) 47.0(8.3) 57.8(14.3) 67.7(19.8) 76.4(24.7) 82.1(27.8) 81.0(27.2) 74.7(23.7) 63.8(17.7) 53.4(11.9) 43.7(6.5) 60.5(15.8) Daily mean °F (°C) 30.5(−0.8) 32.0(0.0) 38.5(3.6) 48.5(9.2) 58.5(14.7) 67.9(19.9) 73.9(23.3) 72.9(22.7) 66.0(18.9) 54.7(12.6) 44.7(7.1) 36.3(2.4) 52.0(11.1) Average low °F (°C) 23.0(−5.0) 23.9(−4.5) 30.1(−1.1) 39.3(4.1) 49.4(9.7) 59.3(15.2) 65.7(18.7) 64.7(18.2) 57.3(14.1) 45.5(7.5) 35.9(2.2) 28.9(−1.7) 43.9(6.6) Mean minimum °F (°C) 5(−15) 9(−13) 16(−9) 27(−3) 38(3) 48(9) 57(14) 54(12) 45(7) 31(−1) 22(−6) 15(−9) 6(−14) Record low °F (°C) −8(−22) −6(−21) 1(−17) 17(−8) 30(−1) 40(4) 50(10) 43(6) 34(1) 23(−5) 13(−11) −3(−19) −8(−22) Average precipitation inches (mm) 2.72(69) 2.84(72) 3.66(93) 4.19(106) 3.54(90) 3.47(88) 3.36(85) 3.55(90) 4.03(102) 3.78(96) 3.12(79) 3.53(90) 41.79(1,061) Average precipitation days (≥ 0.01 in) 9.5 8.5 9.6 10.9 12.9 11.8 10.4 9.9 9.3 11.1 9.4 11.0 124.3 Average relative humidity (%) 62.8 60.3 64.4 65.1 69.7 73.8 74.2 73.8 74.1 70.4 68.2 63.6 68.4 Average ultraviolet index 2 2 4 6 7 8 8 8 6 4 2 1 5 Source 1: NOAA[47][48] Source 2: Weatherbase (humidity),[49] Weather Atlas (UV index)[50] Streetscape[edit] The city from the south with The Hill in the foreground. East Rock is visible in the background. American Elm in New Haven New Haven has a long tradition of urban planning and a purposeful design for the city's layout.[51] The city could be argued to have some of the first preconceived layouts in the country.[52][53] Upon founding, New Haven was laid out in a grid plan of nine square blocks; the central square was left open, in the tradition of many New England towns, as the city green (a commons area). The city also instituted the first public tree planting program in America. As in other cities, many of the elms that gave New Haven the nickname ""Elm City"" perished in the mid-20th century due to Dutch elm disease, although many have since been replanted. The New Haven Green is currently home to three separate historic churches which speak to the original theocratic nature of the city.[8] The Green remains the social center of the city today. It was named a National Historic Landmark in 1970. Downtown New Haven, occupied by nearly 7,000 residents, has a more residential character than most downtowns.[54] The downtown area provides about half of the city's jobs and half of its tax base[54] and in recent years has become filled with dozens of new upscale restaurants, in addition to shops and thousands of apartments and condominium units which subsequently help overall growth of the city.[55] Neighborhoods[edit] The Quinnipiac River Historic District, located in the Fair Haven neighborhood, is one of dozens of listed historic districts in New Haven. Main article: Neighborhoods of New Haven, Connecticut The city has many distinct neighborhoods. In addition to Downtown, centered on the central business district and the Green, are the following neighborhoods: the west central neighborhoods of Dixwell and Dwight; the southern neighborhoods of The Hill, historic water-front City Point (or Oyster Point), and the harborside district of Long Wharf; the western neighborhoods of Beaver Hills, Edgewood, West River, Westville, Amity, and West Rock-Westhills; East Rock, Cedar Hill, Prospect Hill, and Newhallville in the northern side of town; the east central neighborhoods of Mill River and Wooster Square, an Italian-American neighborhood; Fair Haven, an immigrant community located between the Mill and Quinnipiac rivers; Quinnipiac Meadows and Fair Haven Heights across the Quinnipiac River; and facing the eastern side of the harbor, The Annex and East Shore (or Morris Cove).[56][57][58][59] Demographics[edit] Census data[edit] See also: List of Connecticut locations by per capita income Graph of New Haven demographics from the US Census, 1790–2010 Historical populationYearPop.±%17565,085—    17748,295+63.1%17904,487−45.9%18004,049−9.8%18105,772+42.6%18207,147+23.8%183010,180+42.4%184012,960+27.3%185020,345+57.0%186039,267+93.0%187050,840+29.5%188062,882+23.7%189086,045+36.8%1900108,027+25.5%1910133,605+23.7%1920162,537+21.7%1930162,665+0.1%1940160,605−1.3%1950164,443+2.4%1960152,048−7.5%1970137,707−9.4%1980126,021−8.5%1990130,474+3.5%2000123,626−5.2%2010129,779+5.0%2019130,250+0.4%Source: U.S. Decennial Census[2]Connecticut Census 1756 & 1774[60] The U.S. Census Bureau reports a 2010 population of 129,779, with 47,094 households and 25,854 families within the city of New Haven. The population density was 6,859.8 people per square mile (2,648.6/km2). There were 52,941 housing units at an average density of 2,808.5 per square mile (1,084.4/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 42.6% White, 35.4% African American, 0.5% Native American, 4.6% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 12.9% from other races, and 3.9% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino residents of any race were 27.4% of the population.[61] Non-Hispanic Whites were 31.8% of the population in 2010,[62] down from 69.6% in 1970.[63] The city's demography is shifting rapidly: New Haven has always been a city of immigrants and the Latino population is growing rapidly. Previous influxes among ethnic groups have been African-Americans in the postwar era, and Irish, Italian and (to a lesser degree) Slavic peoples in the prewar period. As of the 2010 census, of the 47,094 households, 29.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 27.5% include married couples living together, 22.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 45.1% were non-families. 36.1% of all households were made up of individuals, and 10.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.40 and the average family size 3.19.[64][65] The ages of New Haven's residents were 25.4% under the age of 18, 16.4% from 18 to 24, 31.2% from 25 to 44, 16.7% from 45 to 64, and 10.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 29 years, which was significantly lower than the national average. There were 91.8 males per 100 females. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 87.6 males. The median income for a household in the city was $29,604, and the median income for a family was $35,950. Median income for males was $33,605, compared with $28,424 for females. The per capita income for the city was $16,393. About 20.5% of families and 24.4% of the population were living below the poverty line, including 32.2% of those under age 18 and 17.9% of those age 65 or over.[64][65] Other data[edit] It is estimated that 14% of New Haven residents are pedestrian commuters, ranking it number four by highest percentage in the United States. This is primarily due to New Haven's small area and the presence of Yale University. New Haven is noted for having the highest percentage of Italian American residents of any US city.[66] New Haven is a predominantly Roman Catholic city, as the city's Dominican, Irish, Italian, Mexican, Ecuadorian, and Puerto Rican populations are overwhelmingly Catholic. The city is part of the Archdiocese of Hartford. Jews also make up a considerable portion of the population, as do Black Baptists. There is a growing number of (mostly Puerto Rican) Pentecostals as well. There are churches for all major branches of Christianity within the city, multiple store-front churches, ministries (especially in working-class Latino and Black neighborhoods), a mosque, many synagogues (including two yeshivas), and other places of worship; the level of religious diversity in the city is high.[citation needed] A study of the demographics of the New Haven metro area, based on age, educational attainment, and race and ethnicity, found that they were the closest of any American city to the national average.[67] Economy[edit] Data from City-Data.com[68] The Port of New Haven New Haven's economy originally was based in manufacturing, but the postwar period brought rapid industrial decline; the entire Northeast was affected, and medium-sized cities with large working-class populations, like New Haven, were hit particularly hard. Simultaneously, the growth and expansion of Yale University further affected the economic shift. Today, over half (56%) of the city's economy is now made up of services, in particular education and health care; Yale is the city's largest employer, followed by Yale – New Haven Hospital. Other large employers include Southern Connecticut State University, Assa Abloy lock manufacturing, the Knights of Columbus headquarters, Higher One, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Covidien and United Illuminating.[69] Clothing stores Gant and Ann Taylor were founded in the city. In 2017, New Haven was ranked by a Verizon study as one of the top 10 cities in America for launching tech startups, and top two in New England.[70] Industry sectors: Agriculture (.6%), Construction and Mining (4.9%), Manufacturing (2.9%), Transportation and Utilities (2.9%), Trade (21.7%), Finance and Real Estate (7.1%), Services (55.9%), Government (4.0%) Headquarters[edit] The Knights of Columbus, the world's largest Catholic fraternal service organization and a Fortune 1000 company, is headquartered in New Haven.[71] Two more Fortune 1000 companies are based in Greater New Haven: the electrical equipment producers Hubbell Incorporated, based in Orange,[72] and Amphenol, based in Wallingford.[73] Eight Courant 100 companies are based in Greater New Haven, with four headquartered in New Haven proper.[74] New Haven-based companies traded on stock exchanges include NewAlliance Bank, the second largest bank in Connecticut and fourth-largest in New England (NYSE: NAL), Higher One Holdings (NYSE: ONE), a financial services firm United Illuminating, the electricity distributor for southern Connecticut (NYSE: UIL), Achillion Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: ACHN), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), and Transpro Inc. (AMEX: TPR). Vion Pharmaceuticals is traded OTC (OTC BB: VIONQ.OB). Other notable companies based in the city include the Peter Paul Candy Manufacturing Company (the candy-making division of the Hershey Company), and the American division of Assa Abloy (one of the world's leading manufacturers of locks). The Southern New England Telephone Company (SNET) began operations in the city as the District Telephone Company of New Haven in 1878; the company remains headquartered in New Haven as a subsidiary of Frontier Communications and provides telephone service for all but two municipalities in Connecticut.[75] SeeClickFix was founded and has been headquartered in the city since 2007. Law and Government[edit] Political structure[edit] See also: List of mayors of New Haven, Connecticut and Mayoral elections in New Haven, Connecticut Statue of Roman orator Cicero at the New Haven County Courthouse New Haven is governed via the mayor-council system. Connecticut municipalities (like those of neighboring states Massachusetts and Rhode Island) provide nearly all local services (such as fire and rescue, education, snow removal, etc.), as county government has been abolished since 1960.[76] New Haven City Hall New Haven County merely refers to a grouping of towns and a judicial district, not a governmental entity. New Haven is a member of the South Central Connecticut Regional Council of Governments (SCRCOG), a regional agency created to facilitate coordination between area municipal governments and state and federal agencies, in the absence of county government.[77] Justin Elicker is the mayor of New Haven. He was sworn in as the 51st mayor of New Haven on January 1, 2020. The city council, called the Board of Alders, consists of thirty members, each elected from single-member wards.[78] Each of the 30 wards consists of slightly over 4,300 residents; redistricting takes place every ten years.[79] The city is overwhelmingly Democratic. In 2017, of the town's 83,694 voters, 66% were registered as Democrats (-4% since 2015), 4% were registered as Republicans (+1%), and 29% were unaffiliated (+3).[80] The board of alders is dominated by Democrats; a Republican has not served as a New Haven alder since 2011.[81][82] New Haven is served by the New Haven Police Department, which had 443 sworn officers in 2011.[83] The city is also served by the New Haven Fire Department. New Haven lies within Connecticut's 3rd congressional district and has been represented by Rosa DeLauro since 1991. Martin Looney and Gary Holder-Winfield represent New Haven in the Connecticut State Senate, and the city lies within six districts (numbers 92 through 97) of the Connecticut House of Representatives.[84][85] The Greater New Haven area is served by the New Haven Judicial District Court and the New Haven Superior Court, both headquartered at the New Haven County Courthouse.[86] The federal District Court for the District of Connecticut has a New Haven facility, the Richard C. Lee United States Courthouse. Political history[edit] See also: List of Yale University people § Law and politics; and List of people from New Haven, Connecticut § Politicians A portrait of Roger Sherman, signer of the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution, author of the Connecticut Compromise, and the first mayor of New Haven New Haven is the birthplace of former president George W. Bush,[87] who was born when his father, former president George H. W. Bush, was living in New Haven while a student at Yale. In addition to being the site of the college educations of both Presidents Bush, as Yale students, New Haven was also the temporary home of former presidents William Howard Taft, Gerald Ford, and Bill Clinton, as well as Secretary of State John Kerry. President Clinton met his wife, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, while the two were students at Yale Law School. Former vice presidents John C. Calhoun and Dick Cheney also studied in New Haven (although the latter did not graduate from Yale). Before the 2008 election, the last time there was not a person with ties to New Haven and Yale on either major party's ticket was 1968. James Hillhouse, a New Haven native, served as President pro tempore of the United States Senate in 1801. A predominantly Democratic city, New Haven voters overwhelmingly supported Al Gore in the 2000 election, Yale graduate John Kerry in 2004,[88] and Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. In the 2008 election, New Haven County was third among all Connecticut counties in campaign contributions, after Fairfield and Hartford counties. (Connecticut, in turn, was ranked 14th among all states in total campaign contributions.)[89][90] New Haven was the subject of Who Governs? Democracy and Power in An American City, a very influential book in political science by preeminent Yale professor Robert A. Dahl, which includes an extensive history of the city and thorough description of its politics in the 1950s. New Haven's theocratic history is also mentioned several times by Alexis de Tocqueville in his classic volume on 19th-century American political life, Democracy in America.[91] New Haven was the residence of conservative thinker William F. Buckley, Jr., in 1951, when he wrote his influential God and Man at Yale. William Lee Miller's The Fifteenth Ward and the Great Society (1966) similarly explores the relationship between local politics in New Haven and national political movements, focusing on Lyndon Johnson's Great Society and urban renewal.[92] George Williamson Crawford, a Yale Law School graduate, served as the city's first black corporation counsel from 1954 to 1962, under Mayor Richard C. Lee.[93] In 1970, the New Haven Black Panther trials took place, the largest and longest trials in Connecticut history. Black Panther Party co-founder Bobby Seale and ten other party members were tried for murdering an alleged informant. Beginning on May Day, the city became a center of protest for 12,000 Panther supporters, college students, and New Left activists (including Jean Genet, Benjamin Spock, Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, and John Froines), who amassed on the New Haven Green, across the street from where the trials were being held. Violent confrontations between the demonstrators and the New Haven Police occurred, and several bombs were set off in the area by radicals. The event became a rallying point for the New Left and critics of the Nixon Administration.[94][95] During the summer of 2007, New Haven was the center of protests by anti-immigration groups who opposed the city's program of offering municipal ID cards, known as the Elm City Resident Card, to illegal immigrants.[96][97][98] In 2008, the country of Ecuador opened a consulate in New Haven to serve the large Ecuadorean immigrant population in the area. It is the first foreign mission to open in New Haven since Italy opened a consulate (now closed) in the city in 1910.[99][100] In April 2009, the United States Supreme Court agreed to hear a suit over reverse discrimination brought by 20 white and Hispanic firefighters against the city. The suit involved the 2003 promotion test for the New Haven Fire Department. After the tests were scored, no blacks scored high enough to qualify for consideration for promotion, so the city announced that no one would be promoted. On 29 June 2009, the United States Supreme Court ruled in favor of the firefighters, agreeing that they were improperly denied promotion because of their race.[101] The case, Ricci v. DeStefano, became highly publicized and brought national attention to New Haven politics due to the involvement of then-Supreme Court nominee (and Yale Law School graduate) Sonia Sotomayor in a lower court decision.[102] Garry Trudeau, creator of the political Doonesbury comic strip, attended Yale University. There he met fellow student and later Green Party candidate for Congress Charles Pillsbury, a long-time New Haven resident for whom Trudeau's comic strip is named. During his college years, Pillsbury was known by the nickname ""The Doones"". A theory of international law, which argues for a sociological normative approach in regards to jurisprudence, is named the New Haven Approach, after the city. Connecticut US senator Richard Blumenthal is a Yale graduate, as is former Connecticut US Senator Joe Lieberman who also was a New Haven resident for many years, before moving back to his hometown of Stamford.[103] Crime[edit] See also: America's Safest and Most Dangerous Cities Crime increased in the 1990s, with New Haven having one of the ten highest violent crime rates per capita in the United States.[104] In the late 1990s New Haven's crime began to stabilize. The city, adopting a policy of community policing, saw crime rates drop during the 2000s.[105][106] Violent crime levels vary dramatically among New Haven's neighborhoods, with some areas having crime rates in line with the state of Connecticut average, and others having extremely high rates of crime. A 2011 New Haven Health Department report identifies these issues in greater detail.[107] In 2010, New Haven ranked as the 18th most dangerous city in the United States (albeit below the safety benchmark of 200.00 for the second year in a row).[108] However, according to a completely different analysis conducted by the ""24/7 Wall Street Blog"", in 2011 New Haven had risen to become the fourth most dangerous city in the United States, and was widely cited in the press as such.[109][110] However, an analysis by the Regional Data Cooperative for Greater New Haven, Inc., has shown that due to issues of comparative denominators and other factors, such municipality-based rankings can be considered inaccurate.[111] For example, two cities of identical population can cover widely differing land areas, making such analyses irrelevant. The research organization called for comparisons based on neighborhoods, blocks, or standard methodologies (similar to those used by Brookings, DiversityData, and other established institutions), not based on municipalities. Education[edit] Colleges and universities[edit] New Haven is a notable center for higher education. Yale University, at the heart of downtown, is one of the city's best known features and its largest employer.[112] New Haven is also home to Southern Connecticut State University, part of the Connecticut State University System, and Albertus Magnus College, a private institution. Gateway Community College has a campus in downtown New Haven, formerly located in the Long Wharf district; Gateway consolidated into one campus downtown into a new state-of-the-art campus (on the site of the old Macy's building) and was open for the Fall 2012 semester.[113][114] There are several institutions immediately outside of New Haven, as well. Quinnipiac University and the Paier College of Art are located just to the north, in the town of Hamden. The University of New Haven is located not in New Haven but in neighboring West Haven. The 1911 student body of the Hopkins School, the fifth-oldest educational institution in the United States Primary and secondary schools[edit] New Haven Public Schools is the school district serving the city. Wilbur Cross High School and Hillhouse High School are New Haven's two largest public secondary schools. Hopkins School, a private school, was founded in 1660 and is the fifth-oldest educational institution in the United States.[115] New Haven is home to a number of other private schools as well as public magnet schools, including Metropolitan Business Academy, High School in the Community, Hill Regional Career High School, Co-op High School, New Haven Academy, Edgewood Magnet School, ACES Educational Center for the Arts, the Foote School and the Sound School, all of which draw students from New Haven and suburban towns. New Haven is also home to two Achievement First charter schools, Amistad Academy and Elm City College Prep, and to Common Ground, an environmental charter school. The city is renowned for its progressive school lunch programs,[116] and participation in statewide bussing efforts toward increased diversity in schools.[117] Culture[edit] Cuisine[edit] Livability.com named New Haven as the Best Foodie City in the country in 2014. There are 56 Zagat-rated restaurants in New Haven, the most in Connecticut and the third most in New England (after Boston and Cambridge).[118] More than 120 restaurants are located within two blocks of the New Haven Green.[119] The city is home to an eclectic mix of ethnic restaurants and small markets specializing in various foreign foods.[120][121] Represented cuisines include Malaysian, Ethiopian, Spanish, Belgian, French, Greek, Latin American, Mexican, Italian, Thai, Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Korean, Indian, Jamaican, Cuban, Peruvian, Syrian/Lebanese, and Turkish.[122] White clam pizza from Pepe's, in the classic New Haven-style New Haven's greatest culinary claim to fame may be its pizza, which has been claimed to be among the best in the country,[123][124][125][126] or even in the world.[127][128] New Haven-style pizza, called ""apizza"", made its debut at the iconic Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana (known as Pepe's) in 1925.[129] Apizza is baked in coal- or wood-fired brick ovens, and is notable for its thin crust. Apizza may be red (with a tomato-based sauce) or white (with a sauce of garlic and olive oil), and pies ordered ""plain"" are made without the otherwise customary mozzarella (originally smoked mozzarella, known as ""scamorza"" in Italian). A white clam pie is a well-known specialty of the restaurants on Wooster Street in the Little Italy section of New Haven, including Pepe's and Sally's Apizza (which opened in 1938). Modern Apizza on State Street, which opened in 1934, is also well-known.[130] Louis' Lunch, where the hamburger was reputedly invented in 1900 A second New Haven gastronomical claim to fame is Louis' Lunch, which is located in a small brick building on Crown Street and has been serving fast food since 1895.[131] Though fiercely debated, the restaurant's founder Louis Lassen is credited by the Library of Congress with inventing the hamburger and steak sandwich.[132][133] Louis' Lunch broils hamburgers, steak sandwiches and hot dogs vertically in original antique 1898 cast iron stoves using gridirons, patented by local resident Luigi Pieragostini in 1939, that hold the meat in place while it cooks.[134] A third New Haven gastronomical claim to fame is Miya's, the first sustainable sushi restaurant in the world. Miya's, founded by Chef Yoshiko Lai in 1982, featured the first sustainable seafood-based sushi menu, the first plant-based sushi menu, and the first invasive species menu in the world. Second generation Miya's chef, Bun Lai, is the 2016 White House Champions of Change for Sustainable Seafood and a James Beard Foundation Award nominee. Chef Bun Lai is credited as the first chef in the world for implementing a sustainability paradigm to the cuisine of sushi.[135][136][137][138][139] Miya's sushi rolls made with invasive Asian shore crab During weekday lunchtime, over 150 lunch carts and food trucks cater to diners around the city.[140] The carts and food trucks cluster at four main points: on Long Wharf Drive, along the city's shoreline with quick access off Interstate 95,[141] by Yale – New Haven Hospital in the center of the Hospital Green (Cedar and York streets), by Yale's Trumbull College (Elm and York streets), and on the intersection of Prospect and Sachem streets by the Yale School of Management.[142] Popular farmers' markets, managed by the local non-profit CitySeed,[143] set up shop weekly in several neighborhoods, including Westville/Edgewood Park, Fair Haven, Upper State Street, Wooster Square, and Downtown/New Haven Green. A large grocery store, the Elm City Market, opened on 360 State Street in New Haven in early fall 2011 and served local produce and groceries to the community. Originally, the market was a member-owned co-op,[144] but debt defaults in August 2014 forced a sale of the business. It is now an employee-owned business; the co-op's previous owners received no equity in the new business.[145] In the past several years, two separate Downtown food tour companies have started offering popular restaurant tours on weekends. Taste of New Haven Tours offers several different weekly restaurant/bar tours and a popular pizza, bike, and pints tour. Culinary Walking Tours offers monthly restaurant tours and sponsors an annual Elm City Iron Chef competition. Theatre and film[edit] The city hosts numerous theatres and production houses, including the Yale Repertory Theatre, the Long Wharf Theatre, and the Shubert Theatre. There is also theatre activity from the Yale School of Drama, which works through the Yale University Theatre and the student-run Yale Cabaret. Southern Connecticut State University hosts the Lyman Center for the Performing Arts. The shuttered Palace Theatre (opposite the Shubert Theatre) was renovated and reopened as the College Street Music Hall in May, 2015. Smaller theatres include the Little Theater on Lincoln Street. Cooperative Arts and Humanities High School also has a theatre on College Street. The theatre is used for student productions, and is the home to weekly services to a local non-denominational church, the City Church New Haven.[146] The Shubert Theatre once premiered many major theatrical productions before their Broadway debuts. Productions that premiered at the Shubert include Oklahoma! (which was also written in New Haven[147]), Carousel, South Pacific, My Fair Lady, The King and I, and The Sound of Music, and the Tennessee Williams play A Streetcar Named Desire. Bow Tie Cinemas owns and operates the Criterion Cinemas, the first new movie theater to open in New Haven in over 30 years and the first luxury movie complex in the city's history. The Criterion has seven screens and opened in November 2004, showing a mix of upscale first run commercial and independent film.[148] Museums[edit] The historic Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale The Yale Center for British Art, designed by Louis Kahn New Haven has a variety of museums, many of them associated with Yale. The Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library features an original copy of the Gutenberg Bible. There is also the Connecticut Children's Museum; the Knights of Columbus museum near that organization's world headquarters; the Peabody Museum of Natural History; the Yale University Collection of Musical Instruments; the Eli Whitney Museum (across the town line in Hamden, Connecticut, on Whitney Avenue); the Yale Center for British Art, which houses the largest collection of British art outside the U.K.,[149] and the Yale University Art Gallery, the western hemisphere's oldest college art museum.[150] New Haven is also home to the New Haven Museum and Historical Society on Whitney Avenue, which has a library of many primary source treasures dating from Colonial times to the present. Artspace on Orange Street is one of several contemporary art galleries around the city, showcasing the work of local, national, and international artists. Others include City Gallery and A. Leaf Gallery in the downtown area. Westville galleries include Kehler Liddell, Jennifer Jane Gallery, and The Hungry Eye. The Erector Square complex in the Fair Haven neighborhood houses, the Parachute Factory gallery along with numerous artist studios, and the complex serves as an active destination during City-Wide Open Studios held yearly in October. New Haven is the home port of a life-size replica of the historical Freedom Schooner Amistad, which is open for tours at Long Wharf pier at certain times during the summer. Also at Long Wharf pier is the Quinnipiack schooner, offering sailing cruises of the harbor area throughout the summer. The Quinnipiack also functions as a floating classroom for hundreds of local students. Music[edit] The New Haven Green is the site of many free music concerts, especially during the summer months. These have included the New Haven Symphony Orchestra, the July Free Concerts on the Green, and the New Haven Jazz Festival in August. The Jazz Festival, which began in 1982, is one of the longest-running free outdoor festivals in the U.S., until it was canceled for 2007. Headliners such as The Breakfast, Dave Brubeck, Ray Charles and Celia Cruz have historically drawn 30,000 to 50,000 fans, filling up the New Haven Green to capacity. The New Haven Jazz Festival was revived in 2008 and has been sponsored since by Jazz Haven.[151] New Haven is home to the concert venue Toad's Place, and a new venue, College Street Music Hall. The city has retained an alternative art and music underground that has helped to influence post-punk era music movements such as indie, college rock and underground hip-hop. Other local venues include Cafe Nine, BAR, Pacific Standard Tavern, Stella Blues, Three Sheets, Firehouse 12, and Rudy's. The Yale School of Music contributes to the city's music scene by offering hundreds of free concerts throughout the year at venues in and around the Yale campus. Large performances are held in the 2,700-seat Woolsey Hall auditorium, which contains the world's largest symphonic organs, while chamber music and recitals are performed in Sprague Hall. Hardcore band Hatebreed are from Wallingford, but got their start in New Haven under the name Jasta 14. The band Miracle Legion formed in New Haven in 1983. Folk musicians from New Haven include Loren Mazzacane Connors and Kath Bloom. The Hillhouse Opera Company is a U.S. non-profit[152] opera company based in New Haven that performs in the New Haven area. Founded in 2008 by Victoria Leigh Gardner, Nicole Rodriguez and Jim Coatsworth Hillhouse Opera Company has performed operas as well as opera scenes programs, master classes and concert series.[153][154][155] In 2011, the Company professionally staged the works created through the Riverview Opera Project. The Riverview Opera Project created workshops for children and adolescents at Riverview Hospital, Connecticut's only state-funded psychiatric hospital for youth, and helped them to successfully create, produce, and perform four original operas.[156] Festivals[edit] In addition to the Jazz Festival (described above), New Haven serves as the home city of the annual International Festival of Arts and Ideas. New Haven's Saint Patrick's Day parade, which began in 1842, is New England's oldest and draws the largest crowds of any one-day spectator event in Connecticut.[157] The St. Andrew the Apostle Italian Festival has taken place in the historic Wooster Square neighborhood every year since 1900. Other parishes in the city celebrate the Feast of Saint Anthony of Padua and a carnival in honor of St. Bernadette Soubirous.[158] New Haven celebrates Powder House Day every April on the New Haven Green to commemorate the city's entrance into the Revolutionary War. The annual Wooster Square Cherry Blossom Festival[159] commemorates the 1973 planting of 72 Yoshino Japanese cherry blossom trees by the New Haven Historic Commission in collaboration with the New Haven Parks Department and residents of the neighborhood. The Festival now draws well over 5,000 visitors. The Film Fest New Haven has been held annually since 1995. Nightlife[edit] In the past decade downtown has seen an influx of new restaurants, bars, and nightclubs. Large crowds are drawn to the Crown Street area downtown on weekends where many of the restaurants and bars are located. Crown Street between State and High Streets has dozens of establishments, as do nearby Temple and College Streets. Away from downtown, Upper State Street has a number of restaurants and bars popular with local residents and weekend visitors. Newspapers and media[edit] New Haven is served by the daily New Haven Register, the weekly ""alternative"" New Haven Advocate (which is run by Tribune, the corporation owning the Hartford Courant), the online daily New Haven Independent,[160] and the monthly Grand News Community Newspaper. Downtown New Haven is covered by an in-depth civic news forum, Design New Haven. The Register also backs PLAY magazine, a weekly entertainment publication. The city is also served by several student-run papers, including the Yale Daily News, the weekly Yale Herald and a humor tabloid, Rumpus Magazine. WTNH Channel 8, the ABC affiliate for Connecticut, WCTX Channel 59, the MyNetworkTV affiliate for the state, Connecticut Public Television station WEDY channel 65, a PBS affiliate, and WTXX Channel 34, the IntrigueTV affiliate, broadcast from New Haven. All New York City news and sports team stations broadcast to New Haven County. Sports and athletics[edit] Yale Bowl during ""The Game"" in 2001 Main article: Sports in New Haven, Connecticut New Haven has a history of professional sports franchises dating back to the 19th century[161] and has been the home to professional baseball, basketball, football, hockey, and soccer teams—including the New York Giants of the National Football League from 1973 to 1974, who played at the Yale Bowl. Throughout the second half of the 20th century, New Haven consistently had minor league hockey and baseball teams, which played at the New Haven Arena (built in 1926, demolished in 1972), New Haven Coliseum (1972–2002), and Yale Field (1928–present). When John DeStefano, Jr., became mayor of New Haven in 1995, he outlined a plan to transform the city into a major cultural and arts center in the Northeast, which involved investments in programs and projects other than sports franchises. As nearby Bridgeport built new sports facilities, the brutalist New Haven Coliseum rapidly deteriorated. Believing the upkeep on the venue to be a drain of tax dollars, the DeStefano administration closed the Coliseum in 2002; it was demolished in 2007. New Haven's last professional sports team, the New Haven County Cutters, left in 2009. The DeStefano administration did, however, see the construction of the New Haven Athletic Center in 1998, a 94,000-square-foot (8,700 m2) indoor athletic facility with a seating capacity of over 3,000. The NHAC, built adjacent to Hillhouse High School, is used for New Haven public schools athletics, as well as large-scale area and state sporting events; it is the largest high school indoor sports complex in the state.[162][163][164] New Haven was the host of the 1995 Special Olympics World Summer Games; then-President Bill Clinton spoke at the opening ceremonies.[165] The city is home to the Pilot Pen International tennis event, which takes place every August at the Connecticut Tennis Center, one of the largest tennis venues in the world.[166] New Haven biannually hosts ""The Game"" between Yale and Harvard, the country's second-oldest college football rivalry. Numerous road races take place in New Haven, including the USA 20K Championship during the New Haven Road Race.[167] Greater New Haven is home to a number of college sports teams. The Yale Bulldogs play Division I college sports, as do the Quinnipiac Bobcats in neighboring Hamden. Division II athletics are played by Southern Connecticut State University and the University of New Haven (actually located in neighboring West Haven), while Albertus Magnus College athletes perform at the Division III level. New Haven is home to many New York Yankees, New York Mets, & Boston Red Sox fans due to the proximity of New York City & Boston.[168] Walter Camp, deemed the ""father of American football,"" was a New Havener. The New Haven Warriors rugby league team play in the AMNRL. They have a large number of Pacific Islanders playing for them.[169] Their field is located at the West Haven High School's Ken Strong Stadium.[170] They won the 2008 AMNRL Grand Final.[171] Structures[edit] Architecture[edit] Collegiate Gothic architecture is popular in New Haven New Haven has many architectural landmarks dating from every important time period and architectural style in American history. The city has been home to a number of architects and architectural firms that have left their mark on the city including Ithiel Town and Henry Austin in the 19th century and Cesar Pelli, Warren Platner, Kevin Roche, Herbert Newman and Barry Svigals in the 20th. The Yale School of Architecture has fostered this important component of the city's economy. Cass Gilbert, of the Beaux-Arts school, designed New Haven's Union Station and the New Haven Free Public Library and was also commissioned for a City Beautiful plan in 1919. Frank Lloyd Wright, Marcel Breuer, Alexander Jackson Davis, Philip C. Johnson, Gordon Bunshaft, Louis Kahn, James Gamble Rogers, Frank Gehry, Charles Willard Moore, Stefan Behnisch, James Polshek, Paul Rudolph, Eero Saarinen and Robert Venturi all have designed buildings in New Haven. Yale's 1950s-era Ingalls Rink, designed by Eero Saarinen, was included on the America's Favorite Architecture list created in 2007.[172] Several residential homes in New Haven were designed by Alice Washburn, a noted female architect whose Colonial Revival style set a standard for homes in the region.[173] Many of the city's neighborhoods are well-preserved as walkable ""museums"" of 19th- and 20th-century American architecture, particularly by the New Haven Green, Hillhouse Avenue and other residential sections close to Downtown New Haven. Overall, a large proportion of the city's land area is National (NRHP) historic districts. One of the best sources on local architecture is New Haven: Architecture and Urban Design, by Elizabeth Mills Brown.[174] See also: List of tallest buildings in New Haven The five tallest buildings in New Haven are:[175] Connecticut Financial Center 383 ft (117m) 26 floors 360 State Street 338 ft (103m) 32 floors Knights of Columbus Building 321 ft (98m) 23 floors Kline Biology Tower 250 ft (76m) 16 floors Crown Towers 233 ft (71m) 22 floors Historic points of interest[edit] The Graves-Dwight mansion on Hillhouse Avenue See also: National Register of Historic Places listings in New Haven, Connecticut Many historical sites exist throughout the city, including 59 properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Of these, nine are among the 60 U.S. National Historic Landmarks in Connecticut. The New Haven Green, one of the National Historic Landmarks, was formed in 1638, and is home to three 19th-century churches. Below the First Church of Christ in New Haven (referred to as the Center Church on the Green) lies a 17th-century crypt, which is open to visitors.[176] Some of the more famous burials include the first wife of Benedict Arnold and the aunt and grandmother of President Rutherford B. Hayes; Hayes visited the crypt while President in 1880.[177] The Old Campus of Yale University is located next to the Green, and includes Connecticut Hall, Yale's oldest building and a National Historic Landmark. The Hillhouse Avenue area, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is also a part of Yale's campus, has been called a walkable museum, due to its 19th-century mansions and street scape; Charles Dickens is said to have called Hillhouse Avenue ""the most beautiful street in America"" when visiting the city in 1868.[178] The restored Black Rock Fort In 1660, Edward Whalley (a cousin and friend of Oliver Cromwell) and William Goffe, two English Civil War generals who signed the death warrant of King Charles I, hid in a rock formation in New Haven after having fled England upon the restoration of Charles II to the English throne.[179] They were later joined by a third regicide, John Dixwell. The rock formation, which is now a part of West Rock Park, is known as Judges' Cave, and the path leading to the cave is called the Regicides Trail. After the American Revolutionary War broke out in 1776, the Connecticut colonial government ordered the construction of Black Rock Fort (to be built on top of an older 17th-century fort) to protect the port of New Haven. In 1779, during the Battle of New Haven, British soldiers captured Black Rock Fort and burned the barracks to the ground. The fort was reconstructed in 1807 by the federal government (on orders from the Thomas Jefferson administration), and rechristened Fort Nathan Hale, after the Revolutionary War hero who had lived in New Haven. The cannons of Fort Nathan Hale were successful in defying British war ships during the War of 1812. In 1863, during the Civil War, a second Fort Hale was built next to the original, complete with bomb-resistant bunkers and a moat, to defend the city should a Southern raid against New Haven be launched. The United States Congress deeded the site to the state in 1921, and all three versions of the fort have been restored. The site is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places and receives thousands of visitors each year.[180][181] Grove Street Cemetery, a National Historic Landmark which lies adjacent to Yale's campus, contains the graves of Roger Sherman, Eli Whitney, Noah Webster, Josiah Willard Gibbs, Charles Goodyear and Walter Camp, among other notable burials.[182] The cemetery is noted for its Egyptian Revival gateway, and is the oldest planned burial ground in the United States.[183] The Union League Club of New Haven building, located on Chapel Street, is notable for not only being a historic Beaux-Arts building, but also is built on the site where Roger Sherman's home once stood; George Washington is known to have stayed at the Sherman residence while President in 1789 (one of three times Washington visited New Haven throughout his lifetime).[184][185] Two sites pay homage to the time President and Chief Justice William Howard Taft lived in the city, as both a student and later Professor at Yale: a plaque on Prospect Street marks the site where Taft's home formerly stood,[186] and downtown's Taft Apartment Building (formerly the Taft Hotel) bears the name of the former president who resided in the building for eight years before becoming Chief Justice of the United States.[147] Lighthouse Point Park, a public beach run by the city, was a popular tourist destination during the Roaring Twenties, attracting luminaries of the period such as Babe Ruth and Ty Cobb.[187] The park remains popular among New Haveners, and is home to the Five Mile Point Lighthouse, constructed in 1847, and the Lighthouse Point Carousel, constructed in 1916.[188][189] Five Mile Point Light was decommissioned in 1877 following the construction of Southwest Ledge Light at the entrance of the harbor, which remains in service to this day. Both of the lighthouses and the carousel are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Other historic sites in the city include the Soldiers and Sailors Monument, which stands at the summit of East Rock, the Marsh Botanical Garden, Wooster Square, Dwight Street, Louis' Lunch, and the Farmington Canal, all of which date back to the 19th century. Other historic parks besides the Green include Edgerton Park, Edgewood Park, and East Rock Park, each of which is included on the National Register of Historic Places. Transportation[edit] Rail[edit] Union Station in 2016 New Haven is connected to New York City and points along the Northeast corridor by commuter rail, regional rail and inter-city rail. Service is provided by: Metro-North Railroad's New Haven Line (commuter rail) to points west, such as Bridgeport, Stamford, Greenwich, and New York City Shore Line East (commuter rail) to points east, such as Old Saybrook and New London, with limited rush-hour service west to Stamford Hartford Line (commuter rail) to points north, such as Meriden, Hartford, Windsor, and Springfield, Massachusetts Amtrak (regional and intercity rail) The city's main railroad station is the historic Beaux-Arts Union Station, which serves Metro-North, Hartford Line, and Shore Line East commuter trains. Union Station is also served by four Amtrak lines: the Northeast Regional and the high-speed Acela Express provide service to New York, Washington, D.C. and Boston, and rank as the first and second busiest routes in the country; the New Haven–Springfield Line provides service to Hartford and Springfield, Massachusetts; and the Vermonter provides service to both Washington, D.C., and Vermont, 15 miles (24 km) from the Canada–US border. Amtrak also codeshares with United Airlines for travel to any airport serviced by United Airlines, via Newark Liberty International Airport (IATA: EWR) originating from or terminating at Union Station (IATA: ZVE). An additional station, State Street Station, was opened in 2002, providing passengers easier access to downtown New Haven. State Street Station is currently serviced by Shore Line East and Hartford Line trains, plus some peak-hour Metro-North trips. Bus[edit] A New Haven Division bus in Downtown New Haven, near the Green The New Haven Division of Connecticut Transit (CT Transit), the state's bus system, is the second largest division in the state with 24 routes. All routes originate from the New Haven Green, making it the central transfer hub of the city. Service is provided to 19 different municipalities throughout Greater New Haven. Bus routes were formerly identified by letters, but as of October 8, 2017, all service was renamed using 200-series numbers, in accordance with a renumbering of CTtransit's statewide services.[190] CT Transit's Union Station Shuttle provides free service from Union Station to the New Haven Green and several New Haven parking garages. Peter Pan and Greyhound bus lines have scheduled stops at Union Station, and connections downtown can be made via the Union Station Shuttle. A private company operates the New Haven/Hartford Express which provides commuter bus service to Hartford. The Yale University Shuttle provides free transportation around New Haven for Yale students, faculty, and staff. The New Haven Division buses follow routes that had originally been covered by trolley service. Horse-drawn streetcars began operating in New Haven in the 1860s, and by the mid-1890s all the lines had become electric. In the 1920s and 1930s, some of the trolley lines began to be replaced by bus lines, with the last trolley route converted to bus in 1948. The City of New Haven is in the very early stages of considering the restoration of streetcar (light-rail) service, which has been absent since the postwar period.[191][192][193][194] Bicycle[edit] Bikeshare[edit] On February 21, 2018, New Haven officially launched its Bike New Haven bikeshare program.[195] based on dockless technology powered by Noa Technologies[196] At time of launch, the program features 10 docking stations and 100 bikes, spread throughout the urban core; there are plans to reach 30 bike stations and 300 bikes by the end of April 2018.[195] The launch of the New Haven bikeshare program coincided with the launch of Yale University's own bikeshare program, which uses the same technology powered by Noa.[197] Bike lanes[edit] In 2004, the first bike lane in the city was added to Orange Street, connecting East Rock Park and the East Rock neighborhood to downtown. Since then, bike lanes have also been added to sections of Howard Ave, Elm St, Dixwell Avenue, Water Street, Clinton Avenue and State Street. The city has created recommended bike routes for getting around New Haven, including use of the Canal Trail and the Orange Street lane.[198][199] As of the end of 2012, bicycle lanes have also been added in both directions on Dixwell Avenue along most of the street from downtown to the Hamden town line, as well as along Howard Avenue from Yale New Haven Hospital to City Point. The city has plans to create two additional bike lanes connecting Union Station with downtown, and the Westville neighborhood with downtown. The city has added dozens of covered bike parking spots at Union Station, in order to facilitate more bike commuting to the station.[200] Farmington Canal Greenway[edit] The Farmington Canal Trail is a rail trail that will eventually run continuously from downtown New Haven to Northampton, Massachusetts. The scenic trail follows the path of the historic New Haven and Northampton Company and the Farmington Canal. Currently, there is a continuous 14-mile (23 km) stretch of the trail from downtown, through Hamden and into Cheshire, making bicycle commuting between New Haven and those suburbs possible. The trail is part of the East Coast Greenway, a proposed 3,000-mile (4,800 km) bike path that would link every major city on the East Coast from Florida to Maine. Roads[edit] The Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge, locally known as the Q Bridge, carries ten lanes over the Quinnipiac River along the Connecticut Turnpike. New Haven lies at the intersection of Interstate 95 on the coast—which provides access southwards and/or westwards to the western coast of Connecticut and to New York City, and eastwards to the eastern Connecticut shoreline, Rhode Island, and eastern Massachusetts—and Interstate 91, which leads northward to the interior of Connecticut, Massachusetts and Vermont and the Canada–US border. I-95 is infamous for traffic jams increasing with proximity to New York City; on the east side of New Haven it passes over the Quinnipiac River via the Pearl Harbor Memorial, or ""Q Bridge"", which often presents a major bottleneck to traffic. I-91, however, is relatively less congested, except at the intersection with I-95 during peak travel times. The Oak Street Connector (Connecticut Route 34) intersects I-91 at exit 1, just south of the I-95/I-91 interchange, and runs northwest for a few blocks as an expressway spur into downtown before emptying onto surface roads. The Wilbur Cross Parkway (Connecticut Route 15) runs parallel to I-95 west of New Haven, turning northwards as it nears the city and then running northwards parallel to I-91 through the outer rim of New Haven and Hamden, offering an alternative to the I-95/I-91 journey (restricted to non-commercial vehicles). Route 15 in New Haven is the site of the only highway tunnel in the state (officially designated as Heroes Tunnel), running through West Rock, home to West Rock Park and the Three Judges Cave. The Wilbur Cross Parkway passes through West Rock via Heroes Tunnel, the only highway tunnel in Connecticut. The city also has several major surface arteries. U.S. Route 1 (Columbus Avenue, Union Avenue, Water Street, Forbes Avenue) runs in an east–west direction south of downtown serving Union Station and leading out of the city to Milford, West Haven, East Haven and Branford. The main road from downtown heading northwest is Whalley Avenue (partly signed as Route 10 and Route 63) leading to Westville and Woodbridge. Heading north towards Hamden, there are two major thoroughfares, Dixwell Avenue and Whitney Avenue. To the northeast are Middletown Avenue (Route 17), which leads to the Montowese section of North Haven, and Foxon Boulevard (Route 80), which leads to the Foxon section of East Haven and to the town of North Branford. To the west is Route 34, which leads to the city of Derby. Other major intracity arteries are Ella Grasso Boulevard (Route 10) west of downtown, and College Street, Temple Street, Church Street, Elm Street, and Grove Street in the downtown area. Traffic safety is a major concern for drivers, pedestrians and cyclists in New Haven.[201] In addition to many traffic-related fatalities in the city each year, since 2005, over a dozen Yale students, staff and faculty have been killed or injured in traffic collisions on or near the campus.[202] Airport[edit] Tweed New Haven Regional Airport is located within the city limits 3 miles (5 km) east of the business district. Bus service between Downtown New Haven and Tweed is available via the CT Transit New Haven Division. Taxi service and rental cars are available at the airport. Travel time from Tweed to downtown takes approximately 15 minutes by car. Other nearby airports include: Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, Connecticut. Sikorsky Memorial Airport in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Seaport[edit] Port of New Haven New Haven Harbor is home to the Port of New Haven, a deep-water seaport with three berths capable of hosting vessels and barges as well as the facilities required to handle break bulk cargo. The port has the capacity to load 200 trucks a day from the ground or via loading docks. Rail transportation access is available, with a private switch engine for yard movements and private siding for loading and unloading. Approximately 400,000 square feet (40,000 m2) of inside storage and 50 acres (200,000 m2) of outside storage are available at the site. Five shore cranes with a 250-ton capacity and 26 forklifts, each with a 26-ton capacity, are also available.[69] On June 17, 2013, the city commissioned the Nathan Hale, a 36 foot (11 m) port security vessel capable of serving search and rescue, firefighting, and constabulary roles.[203][204] Infrastructure[edit] Yale's Sterling Memorial Library Hospitals and medicine[edit] The New Haven area supports several medical facilities that are considered some of the best hospitals in the country. There are two major medical centers downtown: Yale – New Haven Hospital has four pavilions, including the Yale – New Haven Children's Hospital[205] and the Smilow Cancer Hospital;[206] the Hospital of Saint Raphael is several blocks north, and touts its excellent cardiac emergency care program. Smaller downtown health facilities are the Temple Medical Center located downtown on Temple Street, Connecticut Mental Health Center/[207] across Park Street from Y-NHH, and the Hill Health Center,[208] which serves the working-class Hill neighborhood. A large Veterans Affairs hospital is located in neighboring West Haven. To the west in Milford is Milford Hospital, and to the north in Meriden is the MidState Medical Center.[209] Yale and New Haven are working to build a medical and biotechnology research hub in the city and Greater New Haven region, and are succeeding to some extent.[citation needed] The city, state and Yale together run Science Park,[210] a large site three blocks northwest of Yale's Science Hill campus.[211] This multi-block site, approximately bordered by Mansfield Street, Division Street, and Shelton Avenue, is the former home of Winchester's and Olin Corporation's 45 large-scale factory buildings. Currently, sections of the site are large-scale parking lots or abandoned structures, but there is also a large remodeled and functioning area of buildings (leased primarily by a private developer) with numerous Yale employees, financial service and biotech companies. A second biotechnology district is being planned for the median strip on Frontage Road, on land cleared for the never-built Route 34 extension.[211] As of late 2009, a Pfizer drug-testing clinic, a medical laboratory building serving Yale – New Haven Hospital, and a mixed-use structure containing parking, housing and office space, have been constructed on this corridor.[211] A former SNET telephone building at 300 George Street is being converted into lab space, and has been quite successful so far in attracting biotechnology and medical firms.[211] Power supply facilities[edit] Electricity for New Haven is generated by a 448 MW oil and gas-fired generating station located on the shore at New Haven Harbor.[212] Pennsylvania Power and Light (PPL) Inc. operates a 220 MW peaking natural gas turbine plant in nearby Wallingford. Near New Haven there is the static inverter plant of the HVDC Cross Sound Cable. There are three PureCell Model 400 fuel cells placed in the city of New Haven—one at the New Haven Public Schools and newly constructed Roberto Clemente School,[213] one at the mixed-use 360 State Street building,[214] and one at City Hall.[215] According to Giovanni Zinn of the city's Office of Sustainability, each fuel cell may save the city up to $1 million in energy costs over a decade.[216] The fuel cells were provided by ClearEdge Power,[217] formerly UTC Power.[218] Additional fuel cells are located at the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History and at the Greater New Haven Water Pollution Control Authority (GNHWPCA).[219] Ikea's New Haven facility also utilizes a 250 kW fuel cell and 940.8 kW solar array.[220] New Haven recently installed solar panels at 11 city schools with a combined power generation capacity of 1.8 MW.[221] Owned and maintained by Greenskies, the panels allow New Haven to purchase electricity at a discounted rate through a power-purchasing agreement. The panels bring New Haven's solar capacity to 2.8 MW and will help New Haven meet its commitment to powering 100% of its municipal operations through clean energy, which it made in Summer 2017[222] and reaffirmed in the 2018 New Haven Climate and Sustainability Framework.[223] In popular culture[edit] This article needs additional citations for verification.

Several downtown streets were closed to traffic and received a ""makeover"" to look like streets of 1957, when the film is set. 500 locals were cast as extras for the film.[226][227] In Everybody's Fine (2009), Robert De Niro has a close encounter in what is supposed to be the Denver train station; the scene was filmed in New Haven's Union Station. Union Station tunnel as seen in Everybody's Fine (2009) New Haven is mentioned in the song Peace Frog by The Doors, referencing a 1967 incident where Morrison was arrested for ""attempting to incite a riot"" in the middle of a concert at the New Haven Arena. Notable people[edit] For a more comprehensive list, see List of people from New Haven, Connecticut. Sister cities[edit] New Haven's sister cities are:[228] Afula, Israel Amalfi, Italy Avignon, France Changsha, China Freetown, Sierra Leone Huế, Vietnam León, Nicaragua, Nicaragua San Francisco Tetlanohcan, Mexico Some of these were selected because of historical connection—Freetown because of the Amistad trial. Others, such as Amalfi and Afula, reflect ethnic groups in New Haven. In 1990, the United Nations named New Haven a ""Peace Messenger City"".

As of the 2010 Census, it has the highest per-capita income, second-highest level of human development behind Massachusetts, and highest median household income in the United States.[10][11] It is bordered by Rhode Island to the east, Massachusetts to the north, New York to the west, and the Long Island Sound to the south. Its capital is Hartford and its most populous city is Bridgeport. Historically the state is part of New England as well as the tri-state area with New York and New Jersey, which together make up metropolitan New York City. The state is named for the Connecticut River which approximately bisects the state. The word ""Connecticut"" is derived from various anglicized spellings of ""Quononoquett"" (Conanicut), a Mohegan-Pequot word for ""long tidal river"".[12] Connecticut's first European settlers were Dutchmen who established a small, short-lived settlement called Fort Hoop in Hartford at the confluence of the Park and Connecticut Rivers. Half of Connecticut was initially claimed by the Dutch colony New Netherland, which included much of the land between the Connecticut and Delaware Rivers, although the first major settlements were established in the 1630s by the English. Thomas Hooker led a band of followers from the Massachusetts Bay Colony and founded the Connecticut Colony; other settlers from Massachusetts founded the Saybrook Colony and the New Haven Colony. The Connecticut and New Haven colonies established documents of Fundamental Orders, considered the first constitutions in America. In 1662, the three colonies were merged under a royal charter, making Connecticut a crown colony. Connecticut was one of the Thirteen Colonies which rejected British rule in the American Revolution. Connecticut is the third smallest state by area,[13] the 29th most populous,[14] and the fourth most densely populated[13] of the fifty states. It is known as the ""Constitution State"", the ""Nutmeg State"", the ""Provisions State"", and the ""Land of Steady Habits"".[1] It was influential in the development of the federal government of the United States (see Connecticut Compromise). The Connecticut River, Thames River, and ports along Long Island Sound have given Connecticut a strong maritime tradition which continues today. The state also has a long history of hosting the financial services industry, including insurance companies in Hartford and hedge funds in Fairfield County.

The state capital and fourth largest city is Hartford, and other major cities and towns (by population) include Bridgeport, New Haven, Stamford, Waterbury, Norwalk, Danbury, New Britain, Greenwich, and Bristol. Connecticut is slightly larger than the country of Montenegro. There are 169 incorporated towns in Connecticut. The highest peak in Connecticut is Bear Mountain in Salisbury in the northwest corner of the state. The highest point is just east of where Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York meet (42°3′ N, 73°29′ W), on the southern slope of Mount Frissell, whose peak lies nearby in Massachusetts.[15] At the opposite extreme, many of the coastal towns have areas that are less than 20 feet (6 m) above sea level. Connecticut has a long maritime history and a reputation based on that history—yet the state has no direct oceanfront (technically speaking). The coast of Connecticut sits on Long Island Sound, which is an estuary. The state's access to the open Atlantic Ocean is both to the west (toward New York City) and to the east (toward the ""race"" near Rhode Island). This situation provides many safe harbors from ocean storms, and many transatlantic ships seek anchor inside Long Island Sound when tropical cyclones pass off the upper East Coast.[citation needed] The Connecticut River cuts through the center of the state, flowing into Long Island Sound. The most populous metropolitan region centered within the state lies in the Connecticut River Valley. Despite Connecticut's relatively small size, it features wide regional variations in its landscape; for example, in the northwestern Litchfield Hills, it features rolling mountains and horse farms, whereas in areas to the east of New Haven along the coast, the landscape features coastal marshes, beaches, and large scale maritime activities. Further information: List of Connecticut rivers Connecticut's rural areas and small towns in the northeast and northwest corners of the state contrast sharply with its industrial cities such as Stamford, Bridgeport, and New Haven, located along the coastal highways from the New York border to New London, then northward up the Connecticut River to Hartford. Many towns in northeastern and northwestern Connecticut center around a green. Near the green typically stand historical visual symbols of New England towns, such as a white church, a colonial meeting house, a colonial tavern or inn, several colonial houses, and so on, establishing a scenic historical appearance maintained for both historic preservation and tourism. Many of the areas in southern and coastal Connecticut have been built up and rebuilt over the years, and look less visually like traditional New England. The northern boundary of the state with Massachusetts is marked by the Southwick Jog or Granby Notch, an approximately 2.5 miles (4.0 km) square detour into Connecticut. The origin of this anomaly is clearly established in a long line of disputes and temporary agreements which were finally concluded in 1804, when southern Southwick's residents sought to leave Massachusetts, and the town was split in half.[16][17] The southwestern border of Connecticut where it abuts New York State is marked by a panhandle in Fairfield County, containing the towns of Greenwich, Stamford, New Canaan, Darien, and parts of Norwalk and Wilton. This irregularity in the boundary is the result of territorial disputes in the late 17th century, culminating with New York giving up its claim to the area, whose residents considered themselves part of Connecticut, in exchange for an equivalent area extending northwards from Ridgefield to the Massachusetts border, as well as undisputed claim to Rye, New York.[18] Further information: Connecticut panhandle Areas maintained by the National Park Service include Appalachian National Scenic Trail, Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley National Heritage Corridor, and Weir Farm National Historic Site.[19] vteRivers of Connecticut by drainage systemLong Island SoundBlack Rock Harbor Ash Creek Rooster River Bridgeport Harbor Pequonnock River Connecticut River Watershed Blackledge River

Northern Connecticut generally experiences a climate with cold winters with moderate snowfall and hot, humid summers. Far southern and coastal Connecticut has a climate with cool winters with a mix of rain and infrequent snow, and the long hot and humid summers typical of the middle and lower East Coast. Connecticut sees a fairly even precipitation pattern with rainfall/snowfall spread throughout the 12 months. Connecticut averages 56% of possible sunshine (higher than the U.S. national average), averaging 2,400 hours of sunshine annually.[20] Early spring (April) can range from slightly cool (40s to low 50s F) to warm (65 to 70 F), while mid and late spring (late April/May) is warm. By late May, the building Bermuda High creates a southerly flow of warm and humid tropical air, bringing hot weather conditions throughout the state, with average highs in New London of 81 °F (27 °C) and 85 °F (29 °C) in Windsor Locks at the peak of summer in late July. On occasion, heat waves with highs from 90 to 100 °F (38 °C) occur across Connecticut. Although summers are sunny in Connecticut, quick moving summer thunderstorms can bring brief downpours with thunder and lightning. Occasionally these thunderstorms can be severe, and the state usually averages one tornado per year.[21] During hurricane season, the remains of tropical cyclones occasionally affect the region, though a direct hit is rare. Weather commonly associated with the fall season typically begins in October and lasts to the first days of December. Daily high temperatures in October and November range from the 50s to 60s (Fahrenheit) with nights in the 40s and upper 30s. Colorful foliage begins across northern parts of the state in early October and moves south and east reaching southeast Connecticut by early November. Far southern and coastal areas, however, have more oak and hickory trees (and fewer maples) and are often less colorful than areas to the north. By December daytime highs are in the 40s °F for much of the state, and average overnight lows are below freezing. Winters (December through mid-March) are generally cold from south to north in Connecticut. The coldest month (January) has average high temperatures ranging from 38 °F (3 °C) in the coastal lowlands to 33 °F (1 °C) in the inland and northern portions on the state. The average yearly snowfall ranges from about 60 inches (1,500 mm) in the higher elevations of the northern portion of the state to only 20–25 inches (510–640 mm) along the southeast coast of Connecticut (Branford to Groton). Generally, any locale north or west of Interstate 84 receives the most snow, during a storm, and throughout the season. Most of Connecticut has less than 60 days of snow cover. Snow usually falls from late November to late March in the northern part of the state, and from early December to mid-March in the southern and coastal parts of the state. Connecticut's record high temperature is 106 °F (41 °C) which occurred in Danbury on July 15, 1995; the record low is −32 °F (−36 °C) which occurred in the Northwest Hills Falls Village on February 16, 1943, and Coventry on January 22, 1961.[22] Monthly normal high and low temperatures for various Connecticut cities (°F) City Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Bridgeport 38/24 40/25 47/32 58/41 68/51 77/61 83/67 81/67 75/59 64/48 53/38 43/30 Hartford 35/18 38/20 47/28 60/38 71/48 79/57 85/63 83/61 75/53 63/42 51/33 40/24 [23][24] Flora[edit] Main article: Flora of Connecticut See also: List of Connecticut tree species Forests consist of a mix of Northeastern coastal forests of Oak in southern areas of the state, to the upland New England-Acadian forests in the northwestern parts of the state. Mountain Laurel (Kalmia latifolia) is the state flower and is native to low ridges in several parts of Connecticut. Rosebay Rhododendron (Rhododendron maximum) is also native to eastern uplands of Connecticut and Pachaug State Forest is home to the Rhododendron Sanctuary Trail. Atlantic white cedar (Chamaecyparis thyoides), is found in wetlands in the southern parts of the state. Connecticut has one native cactus (Opuntia humifusa), found in sandy coastal areas and low hillsides. Several types of beach grasses and wildflowers are also native to Connecticut.[25] Connecticut spans USDA Plant Hardiness Zones 5b to 7a. Coastal Connecticut is the broad transition zone where more southern and subtropical plants are cultivated. In some coastal communities, Magnolia grandiflora (southern magnolia), Crape Myrtles, scrub palms (Sabal minor), Needle Palms (Rhapidophyllum hystrix), and other broadleaved evergreens are cultivated in small numbers.[citation needed] History[edit] Main article: History of Connecticut A map of the Connecticut, New Haven, and Saybrook colonies First people[edit] The name Connecticut is derived from the Mohegan-Pequot word that has been translated as ""long tidal river"" and ""upon the long river"",[26] referring to the Connecticut River. Evidence of human presence in the Connecticut region dates to as much as 10,000 years ago. Stone tools were used for hunting, fishing, and woodworking. Semi-nomadic in lifestyle, these peoples moved seasonally to take advantage of various resources in the area. They shared languages based on Algonquian.[27] The Connecticut region was inhabited by multiple Native American tribes which can be grouped into the Nipmuc, the Sequin or ""River Indians"" (which included the Tunxis, Schaghticoke, Podunk, Wangunk, Hammonasset, and Quinnipiac), the Mattabesec or ""Wappinger Confederacy"" and the Pequot-Mohegan.[28] Some of these groups continue to abide in Connecticut, including the Mohegans, the Pequots, and the Paugusetts.[29] Colonial period[edit] Main articles: New Netherland, Saybrook Colony, Connecticut Colony, New Haven Colony, New England Confederation, and Dominion of New England The first European explorer in Connecticut was Dutchman Adriaen Block,[30] who explored the region in 1614. Dutch fur traders then sailed up the Connecticut River, which they called Versche Rivier (""Fresh River""), and built a fort at Dutch Point in Hartford that they named ""House of Hope"" (Dutch: Huis van Hoop).[31] The Connecticut Colony was originally a number of separate, smaller settlements at Windsor, Wethersfield, Saybrook, Hartford, and New Haven. The first English settlers came in 1633 and settled at Windsor, and then at Wethersfield the following year.[32] John Winthrop the Younger of Massachusetts received a commission to create Saybrook Colony at the mouth of the Connecticut River in 1635.[33] The main body of settlers came in one large group in 1636. They were Puritans from Massachusetts Bay Colony led by Thomas Hooker, who established the Connecticut Colony at Hartford.[34] The Quinnipiack Colony[35] was established by John Davenport, Theophilus Eaton, and others at New Haven in March 1638. The New Haven Colony had its own constitution called ""The Fundamental Agreement of the New Haven Colony"", signed on June 4, 1639.[36] The settlements were established without official sanction of the English Crown, and each was an independent political entity.[37] In 1662, Winthrop traveled to England and obtained a charter from Charles II which united the settlements of Connecticut.[38] Historically important colonial settlements included Windsor (1633), Wethersfield (1634), Saybrook (1635), Hartford (1636), New Haven (1638), Fairfield (1639), Guilford (1639), Milford (1639), Stratford (1639), Farmington (1640), Stamford (1641), and New London (1646). The Pequot War marked the first major clash between colonists and Native Americans in New England. The Pequots reacted with increasing aggression to Colonial settlements in their territory—while simultaneously taking lands from the Narragansett and Mohegan tribes. Settlers responded to a murder in 1636 with a raid on a Pequot village on Block Island; the Pequots laid siege to Saybrook Colony's garrison that autumn, then raided Wethersfield in the spring of 1637. Colonists declared war on the Pequots, organized a band of militia and allies from the Mohegan and Narragansett tribes, and attacked a Pequot village on the Mystic River, with death toll estimates ranging between 300 and 700 Pequots. After suffering another major loss at a battle in Fairfield, the Pequots asked for a truce and peace terms.[39] The western boundaries of Connecticut have been subject to change over time. The Hartford Treaty with the Dutch was signed on September 19, 1650, but it was never ratified by the British. According to it, the western boundary of Connecticut ran north from Greenwich Bay for a distance of 20 miles (32 km),[40][41] ""provided the said line come not within 10 miles of Hudson River"".[40][41] This agreement was observed by both sides until war erupted between England and The Netherlands in 1652. Conflict continued concerning colonial limits until the Duke of York captured New Netherland in 1664.[40][41] On the other hand, Connecticut's original Charter in 1662 granted it all the land to the ""South Sea""—that is, to the Pacific Ocean.[42] Most Colonial royal grants were for long east–west strips. Connecticut took its grant seriously and established a ninth county between the Susquehanna River and Delaware River named Westmoreland County. This resulted in the brief Pennamite Wars with Pennsylvania.[43] Yale College was established in 1701, providing Connecticut with an important institution to educate clergy and civil leaders.[44] The Congregational church dominated religious life in the colony and, by extension, town affairs in many parts.[45] With more than 600 miles of coastline including along its navigable rivers,[46] Connecticut developed during its colonial years the antecedents of a maritime tradition that would later produce booms in shipbuilding, marine transport, naval support, seafood production, and leisure boating. Historical records list the Tryall as the first vessel built in Connecticut Colony, in 1649 at a site on the Connecticut River in present-day Wethersfield.[47] In the two decades leading up to 1776 and the American Revolution, Connecticut boatyards launched about 100 sloops, schooners and brigs according to a database of U.S. customs records maintained online by the Mystic Seaport Museum, the largest being the 180-ton Patient Mary launched in New Haven in 1763.[48] Connecticut's first lighthouse was constructed in 1760 at the mouth of the Thames River with the New London Harbor Lighthouse.[49] American Revolution[edit] Main articles: American Revolutionary War, Lee Resolution, United States Declaration of Independence, Articles of Confederation § Ratification, Northern theater of the American Revolutionary War after Saratoga, Treaty of Paris (1783), Constitutional Convention (United States), Admission to the Union, and List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union A 1799 map of Connecticut which shows The Oblong, from Low's Encyclopaedia Connecticut designated four delegates to the Second Continental Congress who signed the Declaration of Independence: Samuel Huntington, Roger Sherman, William Williams, and Oliver Wolcott.[50] Connecticut's legislature authorized the outfitting of six new regiments in 1775, in the wake of the clashes between British regulars and Massachusetts militia at Lexington and Concord. There were some 1,200 Connecticut troops on hand at the Battle of Bunker Hill in June 1775.[51] In 1775, David Bushnell invented the Turtle which the following year launched the first submarine attack in history, unsuccessfully against a British warship at anchor in New York Harbor.[52] In 1777, the British got word of Continental Army supplies in Danbury, and they landed an expeditionary force of some 2,000 troops in Westport. This force then marched to Danbury and destroyed homes and much of the depot. Continental Army troops and militia led by General David Wooster and General Benedict Arnold engaged them on their return march at Ridgefield in 1777.[53] For the winter of 1778–79, General George Washington decided to split the Continental Army into three divisions encircling New York City, where British General Sir Henry Clinton had taken up winter quarters.[54] Major General Israel Putnam chose Redding as the winter encampment quarters for some 3,000 regulars and militia under his command. The Redding encampment allowed Putnam's soldiers to guard the replenished supply depot in Danbury and to support any operations along Long Island Sound and the Hudson River Valley.[55] Some of the men were veterans of the winter encampment at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, the previous winter. Soldiers at the Redding camp endured supply shortages, cold temperatures, and significant snow, with some historians dubbing the encampment ""Connecticut's Valley Forge"".[56] The state was also the launching site for a number of raids against Long Island orchestrated by Samuel Holden Parsons and Benjamin Tallmadge,[57] and provided men and material for the war effort, especially to Washington's army outside New York City. General William Tryon raided the Connecticut coast in July 1779, focusing on New Haven, Norwalk, and Fairfield.[58] New London and Groton Heights were raided in September 1781 by Benedict Arnold, who had turned traitor to the British.[59] At the outset of the American Revolution, the Continental Congress assigned Nathaniel Shaw Jr. of New London as its naval agent in charge of recruiting privateers to seize British vessels as opportunities presented, with nearly 50 operating out of the Thames River which eventually drew the reprisal from the British force led by Arnold.[60] 19th century[edit] Early national period and industrial revolution[edit] Connecticut ratified the U.S. Constitution on January 9, 1788, becoming the fifth state.[61] The state prospered during the era following the American Revolution, as mills and textile factories were built and seaports flourished from trade[62] and fisheries. After Congress established in 1790 the predecessor to the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service that would evolve into the U.S. Coast Guard, President Washington assigned Jonathan Maltbie as one of seven masters to enforce customs regulations, with Maltbie monitoring the southern New England coast with a 48-foot cutter sloop named Argus.[63] In 1786, Connecticut ceded territory to the U.S. government that became part of the Northwest Territory. The state retained land extending across the northern part of present-day Ohio called the Connecticut Western Reserve.[64] The Western Reserve section was settled largely by people from Connecticut, and they brought Connecticut place names to Ohio. Connecticut made agreements with Pennsylvania and New York which extinguished the land claims within those states' boundaries and created the Connecticut Panhandle. The state then ceded the Western Reserve in 1800 to the federal government,[64] which brought it to its present boundaries (other than minor adjustments with Massachusetts). For the first time in 1800, Connecticut shipwrights launched more than 100 vessels in a single year. Over the following decade to the doorstep of renewed hostilities with Britain that sparked the War of 1812, Connecticut boatyards constructed close to 1,000 vessels, the most productive stretch of any decade in the 19th century.[48] During the war, the British launched raids in Stonington and Essex and blockaded vessels in the Thames River. Derby native Isaac Hull became Connecticut's best-known naval figure to win renown during the conflict, as captain of the USS Constitution. The British blockade during the War of 1812 hurt exports and bolstered the influence of Federalists who opposed the war.[65] The cessation of imports from Britain stimulated the construction of factories to manufacture textiles and machinery. Connecticut came to be recognized as a major center for manufacturing, due in part to the inventions of Eli Whitney and other early innovators of the Industrial Revolution.[66] The war led to the development of fast clippers that helped extend the reach of New England merchants to the Pacific and Indian oceans. The first half of the 19th century saw as well a rapid rise in whaling, with New London emerging as one of the New England industry's three biggest home ports after Nantucket and New Bedford.[67] The state was known for its political conservatism, typified by its Federalist party and the Yale College of Timothy Dwight. The foremost intellectuals were Dwight and Noah Webster,[68] who compiled his great dictionary in New Haven. Religious tensions polarized the state, as the Congregational Church struggled to maintain traditional viewpoints, in alliance with the Federalists. The failure of the Hartford Convention in 1814 hurt the Federalist cause, with the Democratic-Republican Party gaining control in 1817.[69] Connecticut had been governed under the ""Fundamental Orders"" since 1639, but the state adopted a new constitution in 1818.[70] Civil War era[edit] Main article: Connecticut in the American Civil War View of New London in 1854 Connecticut manufacturers played a major role in supplying the Union forces with weapons and supplies during the Civil War. The state furnished 55,000 men, formed into thirty full regiments of infantry, including two in the U.S. Colored Troops, with several Connecticut men becoming generals. The Navy attracted 250 officers and 2,100 men, and Glastonbury native Gideon Welles was Secretary of the Navy. James H. Ward of Hartford was the first U.S. Naval Officer killed in the Civil War.[71] Connecticut casualties included 2,088 killed in combat, 2,801 dying from disease, and 689 dying in Confederate prison camps.[72][73][74] A surge of national unity in 1861 brought thousands flocking to the colors from every town and city. However, as the war became a crusade to end slavery, many Democrats (especially Irish Catholics) pulled back. The Democrats took a pro-slavery position and included many Copperheads willing to let the South secede. The intensely fought 1863 election for governor was narrowly won by the Republicans.[75][76] Second industrial revolution[edit] 1895 map from Rand McNally Connecticut's extensive industry, dense population, flat terrain, and wealth encouraged the construction of railroads starting in 1839. By 1840, 102 miles (164 km) of line were in operation, growing to 402 miles (647 km) in 1850 and 601 miles (967 km) in 1860.[77] The New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad, called the New Haven or ""The Consolidated"", became the dominant Connecticut railroad company after 1872. J. P. Morgan began financing the major New England railroads in the 1890s, dividing territory so that they would not compete. The New Haven purchased 50 smaller companies, including steamship lines, and built a network of light rails (electrified trolleys) that provided inter-urban transportation for all of southern New England. By 1912, the New Haven operated over 2,000 miles (3,200 km) of track with 120,000 employees.[78] As steam-powered passenger ships proliferated after the Civil War, Noank would produce the two largest built in Connecticut during the 19th century, with the 332-foot wooden steam paddle wheeler Rhode Island launched in 1882, and the 345-foot paddle wheeler Connecticut seven years later. Connecticut shipyards would launch more than 165 steam-powered vessels in the 19th century.[48] In 1875, the first telephone exchange in the world was established in New Haven.[79] 20th century[edit] World War I[edit] When World War I broke out in 1914, Connecticut became a major supplier of weaponry to the U.S. military; by 1918, 80% of the state's industries were producing goods for the war effort.[80] Remington Arms in Bridgeport produced half the small-arms cartridges used by the U.S. Army,[81] with other major suppliers including Winchester in New Haven and Colt in Hartford.[82] Connecticut was also an important U.S. Navy supplier, with Electric Boat receiving orders for 85 submarines,[83] Lake Torpedo Boat building more than 20 subs,[84] and the Groton Iron Works building freighters.[85] On June 21, 1916, the Navy made Groton the site for its East Coast submarine base and school. The state enthusiastically supported the American war effort in 1917 and 1918 with large purchases of war bonds, a further expansion of industry, and an emphasis on increasing food production on the farms. Thousands of state, local, and volunteer groups mobilized for the war effort and were coordinated by the Connecticut State Council of Defense.[86] Manufacturers wrestled with manpower shortages; Waterbury's American Brass and Manufacturing Company was running at half capacity, so the federal government agreed to furlough soldiers to work there.[87] Interwar period[edit] In 1919, J. Henry Roraback started the Connecticut Light & Power Co.[88] which became the state's dominant electric utility. In 1925, Frederick Rentschler spurred the creation of Pratt & Whitney in Hartford to develop engines for aircraft; the company became an important military supplier in World War II and one of the three major manufacturers of jet engines in the world.[89] On September 21, 1938, the most destructive storm in New England history struck eastern Connecticut, killing hundreds of people.[90] The eye of the ""Long Island Express"" passed just west of New Haven and devastated the Connecticut shoreline between Old Saybrook and Stonington from the full force of wind and waves, even though they had partial protection by Long Island. The hurricane caused extensive damage to infrastructure, homes, and businesses. In New London, a 500-foot (150 m) sailing ship was driven into a warehouse complex, causing a major fire. Heavy rainfall caused the Connecticut River to flood downtown Hartford and East Hartford. An estimated 50,000 trees fell onto roadways.[91] World War II[edit] The advent of lend-lease in support of Britain helped lift Connecticut from the Great Depression,[92] with the state a major production center for weaponry and supplies used in World War II. Connecticut manufactured 4.1% of total U.S. military armaments produced during the war, ranking ninth among the 48 states,[93] with major factories including Colt[94] for firearms, Pratt & Whitney for aircraft engines, Chance Vought for fighter planes, Hamilton Standard for propellers,[95] and Electric Boat for submarines and PT boats.[96] In Bridgeport, General Electric produced a significant new weapon to combat tanks: the bazooka.[97] On May 13, 1940, Igor Sikorsky made an untethered flight of the first practical helicopter.[98] The helicopter saw limited use in World War II, but future military production made Sikorsky Aircraft's Stratford plant Connecticut's largest single manufacturing site by the start of the 21st century.[99] Post-World War II economic expansion[edit] Connecticut lost some wartime factories following the end of hostilities, but the state shared in a general post-war expansion that included the construction of highways[100] and resulting in middle-class growth in suburban areas. Prescott Bush represented Connecticut in the U.S. Senate from 1952 to 1963; his son George H.W. Bush and grandson George W. Bush both became presidents of the United States.[101] In 1965, Connecticut ratified its current constitution, replacing the document that had served since 1818.[102] In 1968, commercial operation began for the Connecticut Yankee Nuclear Power Plant in East Haddam; in 1970, the Millstone Nuclear Power Station began operations in Waterford.[103] In 1974, Connecticut elected Democratic Governor Ella T. Grasso, who became the first woman in any state to be elected governor without being the wife or widow of a previous governor.[104] Late 20th century[edit] Connecticut's dependence on the defense industry posed an economic challenge at the end of the Cold War. The resulting budget crisis helped elect Lowell Weicker as governor on a third-party ticket in 1990. Weicker's remedy was a state income tax which proved effective in balancing the budget, but only for the short-term. He did not run for a second term, in part because of this politically unpopular move.[105] In 1992, initial construction was completed on Foxwoods Casino at the Mashantucket Pequots reservation in eastern Connecticut, which became the largest casino in the Western Hemisphere. Mohegan Sun followed four years later.[106] Early 21st century[edit] In 2000, presidential candidate Al Gore chose Senator Joe Lieberman as his running mate, marking the first time that a major party presidential ticket included someone of the Jewish faith.[107] Gore and Lieberman fell five votes short of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney in the Electoral College. In the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, 65 state residents were killed, mostly Fairfield County residents who were working in the World Trade Center.[108] In 2004, Republican Governor John G. Rowland resigned during a corruption investigation, later pleading guilty to federal charges.[109][110] Connecticut was hit by three major storms in just over 14 months in 2011 and 2012, with all three causing extensive property damage and electric outages. Hurricane Irene struck Connecticut August 28, and damage totaled $235 million.[111] Two months later, the ""Halloween nor'easter"" dropped extensive snow onto trees, resulting in snapped branches and trunks that damaged power lines; some areas were without electricity for 11 days.[112] Hurricane Sandy had tropical storm-force winds when it reached Connecticut October 29, 2012.[113] Sandy's winds drove storm surges into streets and cut power to 98% of homes and businesses, with more than $360 million in damage.[114] On December 14, 2012, Adam Lanza shot and killed 26 people at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, and then killed himself.[115] The massacre spurred renewed efforts by activists for tighter laws on gun ownership nationally.[116] In the summer and fall of 2016, Connecticut experienced a drought in many parts of the state, causing some water-use bans. As of November 15, 2016 (2016-11-15), 45% of the state was listed at Severe Drought by the U.S. Drought Monitor, including almost all of Hartford and Litchfield counties. All the rest of the state was in Moderate Drought or Severe Drought, including Middlesex, Fairfield, New London, New Haven, Windham, and Tolland counties. This affected the agricultural economy in the state.[117][118][119] The 21st century in Connecticut in photos 9/11 killed 65 people from Connecticut. Governor John G. Rowland resigned from office for corruption in 2004. Tropical Storm Irene, August 2011 The 2011 October nor'easter caused major snow damage in the state. Category 1 Hurricane Sandy made landfall in Connecticut in October 2012, causing heavy destruction. In the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Adam Lanza killed twenty children and six adults.

This includes a natural increase since the last census of 67,427 (222,222 births minus 154,795 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 41,718 people into the state. Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 75,991 people, and migration within the country produced a net loss of 34,273. Based on the 2005 estimates, Connecticut moved from 29th most populous state to 30th. 2018 estimates put Connecticut's population at 3,572,665.[122] 6.6% of its population was reported as being under 5 years old, 24.7% under 18 years old, and 13.8% were 65 years of age or older. Females made up approximately 51.6% of the population, with 48.4% male. In 1790, 97% of the population in Connecticut was classified as ""rural"". The first census in which less than half the population was classified as rural was 1890. In the 2000 census, only 12.3% was considered rural. Most of western and southern Connecticut (particularly the Gold Coast) is strongly associated with New York City; this area is the most affluent and populous region of the state and has high property costs and high incomes. The center of population of Connecticut is located in the town of Cheshire.[123] Connecticut's population density map Population[edit] As of the 2010 United States Census, Connecticut's race and ethnic percentages were: 77.6% White (71.2% Non-Hispanic White, 6.4% White Hispanic) 10.1% Black or African American 0.3% Native American and Alaska Native 3.8% Asian 0.0% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander 5.6% from some other race 2.6% two or more races Hispanics and Latinos of any race made up 13.4% of the population in the 2010 Census.[124] The state's most populous ethnic group is Non-Hispanic White, but this has declined from 98% in 1940 to 71% in 2010.[125] Connecticut's racial breakdown of population Racial composition 1990 [126] 2000 [127] 2010[124] White 87.0% 81.6% 77.6% Black 8.3% 9.1% 10.1% Asian 1.5% 2.4% 3.8% Native 0.2% 0.3% 0.3% Native Hawaiian andother Pacific Islander – – – Other race 2.9% 4.3% 5.6% Two or more races – 2.2% 2.6% As of 2004, 11.4% of the population (400,000) was foreign-born. In 1870, native-born Americans had accounted for 75% of the state's population, but that had dropped to 35% by 1918. As of 2000, 81.69% of Connecticut residents age 5 and older spoke English at home and 8.42% spoke Spanish, followed by Italian at 1.59%, French at 1.31%, and Polish at 1.20%.[128] The largest European ancestry groups are:[129] 19.3% Italian 17.9% Irish 10.7% English 10.4% German 8.6% Polish 6.6% French 3.0% French Canadian 2.7% American 2.0% Scottish 1.4% Scotch Irish Main Street, Newtown Birth data[edit] As of 2011[update], 46.1% of Connecticut's population younger than age 1 were minorities.[130] Racial and ethnic groups in Connecticut, 2010 Note: Births in table do not add up, because Hispanics are counted both by their ethnicity and by their race, giving a higher overall number.

Religion[edit] The religious affiliations of the people of Connecticut as of 2014[update]:[138] Religion in Connecticut (2014)[138] Religion Percent Protestant 35% Catholic 33% None 28% Jewish 3% Mormon 1% Eastern Orthodox 1% Other Christian 1% Buddhist 1% Hindu 1% Muslim 1% Other 2% Do not know 1% A Pew survey of Connecticut residents' religious self-identification showed the following distribution of affiliations: Protestant 35%, Mormonism 1%, Jewish 3%, Roman Catholic 33%, Orthodox 1%, Non-religious 28%, Jehovah's Witness 1%, Hinduism 1%, Buddhism 1% and Islam 1%.[138][139] Jewish congregations had 108,280 (3.2%) members in 2000.[140] The Jewish population is concentrated in the towns near Long Island Sound between Greenwich and New Haven, in Greater New Haven and in Greater Hartford, especially the suburb of West Hartford. According to the Association of Religion Data Archives, the largest Christian denominations, by number of adherents, in 2010 were: the Catholic Church, with 1,252,936; the United Church of Christ, with 96,506; and non-denominational Evangelical Protestants, with 72,863.[140] Recent immigration has brought other non-Christian religions to the state, but the numbers of adherents of other religions are still low. Connecticut is also home to New England's largest Protestant Church: The First Cathedral in Bloomfield, Connecticut, located in Hartford County. Hartford is seat to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Hartford, which is sovereign over the Diocese of Bridgeport and the Diocese of Norwich.

Hartford is the poorest municipality in Connecticut, with a per capita income of $13,428 in 2000.[146] Entering the Merritt Parkway from New York in Greenwich, Connecticut As of December 2019, Connecticut's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 3.8%, with U.S. unemployment at 3.5% that month. Dating back to 1982, Connecticut recorded its lowest unemployment in 2000 between August and October, at 2.2%. The highest unemployment rate during that period occurred in November and December 2010 at 9.3%,[147] but economists expect record new levels of layoffs as a result of business closures in the spring of 2020 as the result of the coronavirus pandemic.[148] Taxation[edit] Tax is collected by the Connecticut Department of Revenue Services[149] and by local municipalities.[150] As of 2012, Connecticut residents had the second highest rate in the nation of combined state and local taxes after New York, at 12.6% of income compared to the national average of 9.9% as reported by the Tax Foundation.[151] Before 1991, Connecticut had an investment-only income tax system. Income from employment was untaxed, but income from investments was taxed at 13%, the highest rate in the U.S., with no deductions allowed for costs of producing the investment income, such as interest on borrowing. In 1991, under Governor Lowell P. Weicker Jr., an independent, the system was changed to one in which the taxes on employment income and investment income were equalized at a maximum rate of 4%. The new tax policy drew investment firms to Connecticut; as of 2019[update], Fairfield County was home to the headquarters for 16 of the 200 largest hedge funds in the world.[152] As of 2019[update], the income tax rates on Connecticut individuals were divided into seven tax brackets of 3% (on income up to $10,000); 5% ($10,000-$50,000); 5.5% ($50,000-$100,000); 6% ($100,000-$200,000); 6.5% ($200,000-$250,000); 6.9% ($250,000-$500,000); and 6.99% above $500,000, with additional amounts owed depending on the bracket.[153] All wages of Connecticut residents are subject to the state's income tax, even if earned outside the state. However, in those cases, Connecticut income tax must be withheld only to the extent the Connecticut tax exceeds the amount withheld by the other jurisdiction.[154] Since New York has higher income tax rates than Connecticut,[155] this effectively means that Connecticut residents who work in New York have no Connecticut income tax withheld. Connecticut permits a credit for taxes paid to other jurisdictions, but since residents who work in other states are still subject to Connecticut income taxation, they may owe taxes if the jurisdictional credit does not fully offset the Connecticut tax amount.[154] Connecticut levies a 6.35% state sales tax on the retail sale, lease, or rental of most goods.[156] Some items and services in general are not subject to sales and use taxes unless specifically enumerated as taxable by statute. A provision excluding clothing under $50 from sales tax was repealed as of July 1, 2011[update].[156] There are no additional sales taxes imposed by local jurisdictions. In 2001, Connecticut instituted what became an annual sales tax ""holiday"" each August lasting one week, when retailers do not have to remit sales tax on certain items and quantities of clothing that has varied from year to year.[157] State law authorizes municipalities to tax property, including real estate, vehicles and other personal property, with state statute providing varying exemptions, credits and abatements. All assessments are at 70% of fair market value.[150] The maximum property tax credit is $200 per return[158] and any excess may not be refunded or carried forward.[159] According to the Tax Foundation, on a per capita basis in the 2017 fiscal year Connecticut residents paid the 3rd highest average property taxes in the nation after New Hampshire and New Jersey.[160] As of January 1, 2020[update], gasoline taxes and fees in Connecticut were 40.13 cents per gallon, 11th highest in the United States which had a nationwide average of 36.13 cents a gallon excluding federal taxes. Diesel taxes and fees as of January 2020 in Connecticut were 46.50 cents per gallon, ninth highest nationally with the U.S. average at 37.91 cents.[161] Real estate[edit] In 2019, sales of single-family homes in Connecticut totaled 33,146 units, a 2.1 percent decline from the 2018 transaction total. The median home sold in 2019 recorded a transaction amount of $260,000, up 0.4 percent from 2018.[162] Connecticut had the seventh highest rate of home foreclosure activity in the country in 2019 at 0.53 percent of the total housing stock.[163] Industries[edit] See also: List of Connecticut companies Hartford Skyline Finance, insurance and real estate was Connecticut's largest industry in 2018 as ranked by gross domestic product, generating $75.7 billion in GDP that year.[164] Major financial industry employers include The Hartford, Travelers, Cigna, the Aetna subsidiary of CVS Health, Mass Mutual, People's United Financial, Bank of America, Realogy,[165] Bridgewater Associates,[166] GE Capital,[167] William Raveis Real Estate,[168] and Berkshire Hathaway through reinsurance and residential real estate subsidiaries. The combined educational, health and social services sector was the largest single industry as ranked by employment, with a combined workforce of 342,600 people at the end of 2019,[169] ranking fourth the year before in GDP at $28.3 billion. The broad business and professional services sector had the second highest GDP total in Connecticut in 2018 at an estimated $33.7 billion.[164] Manufacturing was the third biggest industry in 2018 with GDP of $30.8 billion,[164] dominated by Raytheon Technologies formed in the March 2020 merger of Hartford-based United Technologies and Waltham, Mass.-based Raytheon Co. As of the merger, Raytheon Technologies employed about 19,000 people in Connecticut through subsidiaries Pratt & Whitney and Collins Aerospace.[170] Lockheed Martin subsidiary Sikorsky Aircraft operates Connecticut's single largest manufacturing plant in Stratford,[168] where it makes helicopters. Other major manufacturers include the Electric Boat division of General Dynamics, which makes submarines in Groton,[171] Boehringer Ingelheim, a pharmaceuticals manufacturer with its U.S. headquarters in Ridgefield,[168] and ASML, which in Wilton makes precision lithography machines used to create circuitry on semiconductors and flat-screen displays.[172] Connecticut historically was a center of gun manufacturing, and four gun-manufacturing firms continued to operate in the state as of December 2012[update], employing 2,000 people: Colt, Stag, Ruger, and Mossberg.[173] Marlin, owned by Remington, closed in April 2011.[174] Other large components of the Connecticut economy in 2018 included wholesale trade ($18.1 billion in GDP); information services ($13.8 billion); retail ($13.7 billion); arts, entertainment and food services ($9.1 billion); and construction ($8.3 billion).[164] Tourists spent $9.3 billion in Connecticut in 2017 according to estimates as part of a series of studies commissioned by the state of Connecticut.[175] Foxwoods Resort Casino and Mohegan Sun are the two biggest tourist draws and number among the state's largest employers;[176] both are located on Native American reservations in the eastern part of Connecticut. Connecticut's agricultural production totaled $580 million in 2017, with just over half of that revenue the result of nursery stock production. Milk production totaled $81 million that year, with other major product categories including eggs, vegetables and fruit, tobacco and shellfish.[177] Energy[edit] See also: List of power stations in Connecticut Connecticut's economy uses less energy to produce each dollar of GDP than all other states except California, Massachusetts, and New York. It uses less energy on a per-capita basis than all but six other states. It has no fossil-fuel resources, but does have renewable resources. Average retail electricity prices are the highest among the 48 contiguous states. While the vast majority of state's overall energy consumption is fossil fuels, nuclear power delivered over 40% of state's electricity generation in 2019. Refuse-derived fuels and other biomass provided the largest share of renewable electricity at about a 3% share. Solar and wind generation has grown in recent years. More than three-quarters of solar generation came from distributed small-scale installations such as rooftop solar in 2019, and there is planning underway to significantly increase renewable generation with the state's offshore wind resource.[178] Transportation[edit] Main article: Transportation in Connecticut Roads[edit] For a more comprehensive list, see List of State Routes in Connecticut. The Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge, locally known as the Q Bridge, carries ten lanes over the Quinnipiac River in New Haven, along the Connecticut Turnpike. The Interstate highways in the state are Interstate 95 (I-95) traveling southwest to northeast along the coast, I-84 traveling southwest to northeast in the center of the state, I-91 traveling north to south in the center of the state, and I-395 traveling north to south near the eastern border of the state. The other major highways in Connecticut are the Merritt Parkway and Wilbur Cross Parkway, which together form Connecticut Route 15 (Route 15), traveling from the Hutchinson River Parkway in New York parallel to I-95 before turning north of New Haven and traveling parallel to I-91, finally becoming a surface road in Berlin. I-95 and Route 15 were originally toll roads; they relied on a system of toll plazas at which all traffic stopped and paid fixed tolls. A series of major crashes at these plazas eventually contributed to the decision to remove the tolls in 1988.[179] Other major arteries in the state include U.S. Route 7 (US 7) in the west traveling parallel to the New York state line, Route 8 farther east near the industrial city of Waterbury and traveling north–south along the Naugatuck River Valley nearly parallel with US 7, and Route 9 in the east. Between New Haven and New York City, I-95 is one of the most congested highways in the United States. Although I-95 has been widened in several spots, some areas are only three lanes and this strains traffic capacity, resulting in frequent and lengthy rush hour delays. Frequently, the congestion spills over to clog the parallel Merritt Parkway and even US 1. The state has encouraged traffic reduction schemes, including rail use and ride-sharing.[180] Connecticut also has a very active bicycling community, with one of the highest rates of bicycle ownership and use in the United States, particularly in New Haven. According to the U.S. Census 2006 American Community Survey, New Haven has the highest percentage of commuters who bicycle to work of any major metropolitan center on the East Coast.[181] Rail[edit] A Metro-North Railroad New Haven Line train leaving Stamford Station Rail is a popular travel mode between New Haven and New York City's Grand Central Terminal. Southwestern Connecticut is served by the Metro-North Railroad's New Haven Line, operated by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and providing commuter service to New York City and New Haven, with branches servicing New Canaan, Danbury, and Waterbury. Connecticut lies along Amtrak's Northeast Corridor which features frequent Northeast Regional and Acela Express service from New Haven south to New York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, DC, and Norfolk, VA, as well as north to New London, Providence, Rhode Island and Boston. Coastal cities and towns between New Haven and New London are also served by the Shore Line East commuter line. Several new stations were completed along the Connecticut shoreline recently, and a commuter rail service called the Hartford Line between New Haven and Springfield on Amtrak's New Haven-Springfield Line began operating in June 2018.[182] Hartford Line service is provided by both Amtrak and the Connecticut Department of Transportation's CT Rail, and in addition to its termini serves New Haven State Street, Wallingford, Meriden, Berlin, Hartford, Windsor, and Windsor Locks. Several infill stations are planned to be added in the near future as of 2021. Amtrak's Vermonter runs from Washington to St. Albans, Vermont via the same line. A proposed commuter rail service, the Central Corridor Rail Line, would connect New London with Norwich, Willimantic, Storrs, and Stafford Springs, with service continuing into Massachusetts and Brattleboro. Bus[edit] Statewide bus service is supplied by Connecticut Transit, owned by the Connecticut Department of Transportation, with smaller municipal authorities providing local service. Bus networks are an important part of the transportation system in Connecticut, especially in urban areas like Hartford, Stamford, Norwalk, Bridgeport and New Haven. Connecticut Transit also operates CTfastrak, a bus rapid transit service between New Britain and Hartford. The bus route opened to the public on March 28, 2015.[183][184][185] Air[edit] Bradley International Airport, the state's largest Bradley International Airport,[186] is located in Windsor Locks, 15 miles (24 km) north of Hartford. Many residents of central and southern Connecticut also make heavy use of JFK International Airport and Newark International Airports, especially for international travel. Smaller regional air service is provided at Tweed New Haven Regional Airport. Larger civil airports include Danbury Municipal Airport and Waterbury-Oxford Airport in western Connecticut, Hartford–Brainard Airport in central Connecticut, and Groton-New London Airport in eastern Connecticut. Sikorsky Memorial Airport is located in Stratford and mostly services cargo, helicopter and private aviation. Ferry[edit] The Bridgeport & Port Jefferson Ferry travels between Bridgeport, Connecticut and Port Jefferson, New York by crossing Long Island Sound. Ferry service also operates out of New London to Orient, New York; Fishers Island, New York; and Block Island, Rhode Island, which are popular tourist destinations. Small local services operate the Rocky Hill–Glastonbury Ferry and the Chester–Hadlyme Ferry which cross the Connecticut River.

Before then, New Haven and Hartford alternated as capitals.[61] Constitutional history[edit] Main article: History of the Connecticut Constitution Connecticut is known as the ""Constitution State"". The origin of this nickname is uncertain, but it likely comes from Connecticut's pivotal role in the federal constitutional convention of 1787, during which Roger Sherman and Oliver Ellsworth helped to orchestrate what became known as the Connecticut Compromise, or the Great Compromise. This plan combined the Virginia Plan and the New Jersey Plan to form a bicameral legislature, a form copied by almost every state constitution since the adoption of the federal constitution. Variations of the bicameral legislature had been proposed by Virginia and New Jersey, but Connecticut's plan was the one that was in effect until the early 20th century, when Senators ceased to be selected by their state legislatures and were instead directly elected. Otherwise, it is still the design of Congress. The nickname also might refer to the Fundamental Orders of 1638–39. These Fundamental Orders represent the framework for the first formal Connecticut state government written by a representative body in Connecticut. The State of Connecticut government has operated under the direction of four separate documents in the course of the state's constitutional history. After the Fundamental Orders, Connecticut was granted governmental authority by King Charles II of England through the Connecticut Charter of 1662. Separate branches of government did not exist during this period, and the General Assembly acted as the supreme authority. A constitution similar to the modern U.S. Constitution was not adopted in Connecticut until 1818. Finally, the current state constitution was implemented in 1965. The 1965 constitution absorbed a majority of its 1818 predecessor, but incorporated a handful of important modifications. Executive[edit] The governor heads the executive branch. As of 2020[update], Ned Lamont is the Governor[187] and Susan Bysiewicz is the Lieutenant Governor;[188] both are Democrats. From 1639 until the adoption of the 1818 constitution, the governor presided over the General Assembly. In 1974, Ella Grasso was elected as the governor of Connecticut. This was the first time in United States history when a woman was a governor without her husband being governor first.[104] There are several executive departments: Administrative Services, Agriculture, Banking, Children and Families, Consumer Protection, Correction, Economic and Community Development, Developmental Services, Construction Services, Education, Emergency Management and Public Protection, Energy & Environmental Protection, Higher Education, Insurance, Labor, Mental Health and Addiction Services, Military, Motor Vehicles, Public Health, Public Utility Regulatory Authority, Public Works, Revenue Services, Social Services, Transportation, and Veterans Affairs. In addition to these departments, there are other independent bureaus, offices and commissions.[189] In addition to the Governor and Lieutenant Governor, there are four other executive officers named in the state constitution that are elected directly by voters: Secretary of the State, Treasurer, Comptroller, and Attorney General. All executive officers are elected to four-year terms.[61] Legislative[edit] The legislature is the General Assembly. The General Assembly is a bicameral body consisting of an upper body, the State Senate (36 senators); and a lower body, the House of Representatives (151 representatives).[61] Bills must pass each house in order to become law. The governor can veto the bill, but this veto can be overridden by a two-thirds majority in each house. Per Article XV of the state constitution, Senators and Representatives must be at least 18 years of age and are elected to two-year terms in November on even-numbered years. There also must always be between 30 and 50 senators and 125 to 225 representatives. The Lieutenant Governor presides over the Senate, except when absent from the chamber, when the President pro tempore presides. The Speaker of the House presides over the House.[190] As of 2021[update], Matthew Ritter is the Speaker of the House of Connecticut. As of 2021[update], Connecticut's United States Senators are Richard Blumenthal (Democrat) and Chris Murphy (Democrat).[191] Connecticut has five representatives in the U.S. House, all of whom are Democrats.[192] Locally elected representatives also develop Local ordinances to govern cities and towns.[193] The town ordinances often include noise control and zoning guidelines.[194] However, the State of Connecticut also provides statewide ordinances for noise control as well.[195] Judicial[edit] The highest court of Connecticut's judicial branch is the Connecticut Supreme Court, headed by the Chief Justice of Connecticut. The Supreme Court is responsible for deciding on the constitutionality of the law or cases as they relate to the law. Its proceedings are similar to those of the United States Supreme Court, with no testimony given by witnesses, and the lawyers of the two sides each present oral arguments no longer than thirty minutes. Following a court proceeding, the court may take several months to arrive at a judgment. As of 2020[update] the Chief Justice is Richard A. Robinson. In 1818, the court became a separate entity, independent of the legislative and executive branches.[196] The Appellate Court is a lesser statewide court and the Superior Courts are lower courts that resemble county courts of other states. The State of Connecticut also offers access to Arrest warrant enforcement statistics through the Office of Policy and Management.[197] Local government[edit] See also: Administrative divisions of Connecticut and several lists: List of municipalities of Connecticut by population, List of towns in Connecticut, List of cities in Connecticut, Borough (Connecticut), List of counties in Connecticut Connecticut does not have county government, unlike all other states except Rhode Island. Connecticut county governments were mostly eliminated in 1960, with the exception of sheriffs elected in each county.[198] In 2000, the county sheriff was abolished and replaced with the state marshal system, which has districts that follow the old county territories. The judicial system is divided into judicial districts at the trial-court level which largely follow the old county lines.[199] The eight counties are still widely used for purely geographical and statistical purposes, such as weather reports and census reporting. Connecticut shares with the rest of New England a governmental institution called the New England town. The state is divided into 169 towns which serve as the fundamental political jurisdictions.[61] There are also 21 cities,[61] most of which simply follow the boundaries of their namesake towns and have a merged city-town government. There are two exceptions: the City of Groton, which is a subsection of the Town of Groton, and the City of Winsted in the Town of Winchester. There are also nine incorporated boroughs which may provide additional services to a section of town.[61][200] Naugatuck is a consolidated town and borough. The state is also divided into nine regional councils of government defined by the state Office of Planning and Management, which facilitate regional planning and coordination of services between member towns.[201] The Intragovernmental Policy Division of this Office coordinates regional planning with the administrative bodies of these regions. Each region has an administrative body made up chief executive officers of the member towns. The regions are established for the purpose of planning ""coordination of regional and state planning activities; redesignation of logical planning regions and promotion of the continuation of regional planning organizations within the state; and provision for technical aid and the administration of financial assistance to regional planning organizations"".[201] Politics[edit] Further information: Political party strength in Connecticut and Elections in Connecticut Connecticut political party registration 1958–2012, marked with presidential influence Registered voters[edit] Connecticut residents who register to vote may declare an affiliation to a political party, may become unaffiliated at will, and may change affiliations subject to certain waiting periods. As of 2021[update] around 59% of registered voters are enrolled (1.7% total in 28 third parties minor parties), and ratios among unaffiliated voters and the two major parties are about eight unaffiliated for every seven in the Democratic Party of Connecticut and for every four in the Connecticut Republican Party. (Among the minor parties, the Libertarian Party and Green Party appeared in the Presidential-electors column in 2016, and drew, respectively, 2.96% and 1.39% of the vote.) Many Connecticut towns and cities show a marked preference for moderate candidates of either party.[2] Party registration as of October 27, 2020[202] Party Total voters Percentage Unaffiliated 1,025,878 40.95% Democratic 926,567 36.99% Republican 510,012 20.36% Minor parties 42,619 1.70% Total 2,505,076 100% Voting[edit] In July 2009, the Connecticut legislature overrode a veto by Governor M. Jodi Rell to pass SustiNet, the first significant public-option health care reform legislation in the nation.[203] In April 2012, both houses of the Connecticut state legislature passed a bill (20 to 16 and 86 to 62) that abolished the capital punishment for all future crimes, while 11 inmates who were waiting on the death row at the time could still be executed.[204] Education[edit] Further information: List of school districts in Connecticut Connecticut ranked third in the nation for educational performance, according to Education Week's Quality Counts 2018 report. It earned an overall score of 83.5 out of 100 points. On average, the country received a score of 75.2.[205] Connecticut posted a B-plus in the Chance-for-Success category, ranking fourth on factors that contribute to a person's success both within and outside the K-12 education system. Connecticut received a mark of B-plus and finished fourth for School Finance. It ranked 12th with a grade of C on the K-12 Achievement Index.[205] K–12[edit] See also: Connecticut State Board of Education Public schools[edit] See also: Category:Public schools in Connecticut The Connecticut State Board of Education manages the public school system for children in grades K–12. Board of Education members are appointed by the Governor of Connecticut. Statistics for each school are made available to the public through an online database system called ""CEDAR"".[206] The CEDAR database also provides statistics for ""ACES"" or ""RESC"" schools for children with behavioral disorders.[207] Private schools[edit] See also: Country Day School movement Academy of Our Lady of Mercy, Lauralton Hall (1905) Avon Old Farms School (1927) Bridgeport International Academy (1997) Brunswick School (1902) Canterbury School (1915) Cheshire Academy (1794) Choate Rosemary Hall (1890) East Catholic High School (1961) Ethel Walker School (1911) Fairfield Country Day School (1936) Fairfield College Preparatory School (1942) Foote School (1916) Greens Farms Academy (1925) Greenwich Country Day School (1926) The Gunnery (1850) Hopkins School (1660) Hotchkiss School (1891) Kent School (1906) Kingswood-Oxford School (1909) Loomis Chaffee (1914) Marianapolis Preparatory School (1926) The Master's School (1970) Mercy High School (1963) Miss Porter's School (1843) New Canaan Country School (1916) Northwest Catholic High School (1961) Norwich Free Academy (1854) Notre Dame Catholic High School (1955) Notre Dame High School (1946) Pomfret School (1894) Rumsey Hall School (1900) Sacred Heart Academy (1946) Saint Bernard School (1956) Stanwich School (1998) St. Paul Catholic High School (1966) Suffield Academy (1833) The Taft School (1890) Watkinson School (1881) Westminster School (Connecticut) Westover School (1909) The Williams School (1891) Xavier High School (1963) Colleges and universities[edit] Connecticut was home to the nation's first law school, Litchfield Law School, which operated from 1773 to 1833 in Litchfield.

It may have come from its sailors returning from voyages with nutmeg, which was a very valuable spice in the 18th and 19th centuries. It may have originated in the early machined sheet tin nutmeg grinders sold by early Connecticut peddlers. It is also facetiously said to come from Yankee peddlers from Connecticut who would sell small carved nobs of wood shaped to look like nutmeg to unsuspecting customers.[229] George Washington gave Connecticut the title of ""The Provisions State""[1] because of the material aid that the state rendered to the American Revolutionary War effort. Connecticut is also known as ""The Land of Steady Habits"".[1] According to Webster's New International Dictionary (1993), a person who is a native or resident of Connecticut is a ""Connecticuter"". There are numerous other terms coined in print but not in use, such as ""Connecticotian"" (Cotton Mather in 1702) and ""Connecticutensian"" (Samuel Peters in 1781). Linguist Allen Walker Read suggests the more playful term ""connecticutie"". ""Nutmegger"" is sometimes used,[229] as is ""Yankee"". The official state song is ""Yankee Doodle"". The traditional abbreviation of the state's name is ""Conn"".; the official postal abbreviation is CT. Commemorative stamps issued by the United States Postal Service with Connecticut themes include Nathan Hale, Eugene O'Neill, Josiah Willard Gibbs, Noah Webster, Eli Whitney, the whaling ship the Charles W. Morgan, which is docked at Mystic Seaport, and a decoy of a broadbill duck.

The most selective colleges admit only a fraction of their applicants. While over 43,000 students applied to Harvard in 2020, fewer than one in 20 received an admission letter. Colleges with one of the lowest acceptance rates often appear on lists of the best schools. Thanks to their prestige and reputation, these schools rank among the nation's most elite institutions of higher education. To calculate college acceptance rates, we took the total number of admitted students and divided by the total number of applicants. While most schools admit most applicants, many of the most selective colleges report an acceptance rate of under 10%. We source our data from IPEDS, or the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System. This database, created by the National Center for Education Statistics, tracks the number of applicants at each school, the number admitted, and the number enrolled. IPEDS also monitors standardized test scores, enrollment numbers, and degrees granted. This data offers valuable information for prospective students. This page ranks the schools with the lowest acceptance rates and explains why acceptance rates matter. Note: IPEDS did not report acceptance rate figures for all of the colleges on our list. We did not, however, want to penalize those colleges without data. To that end, we simply excluded those schools from the rankings in this category. What to Consider When Researching College Acceptance Rates College acceptance rates only provide a single data point about a school. Applicants should consider how many students apply to the school, the school's average GPA and SAT scores, the enrollment rate, and other data to understand the acceptance rate. This section explores other factors applicants should consider when reviewing college acceptance rates. 1. How does the acceptance rate percentage break down in comparison to the total number of students applying to your preferred school? A 6% acceptance rate from Harvard may seem daunting, but prospective applicants should consider the number of total applicants and what that 6% acceptance signifies. For example, if an elite university admits 5% of applicants, but the school receives 50,000 applications, that still means that 2,500 students have been accepted. In contrast, if you apply to a school with a 50% acceptance rate, but that school only receives 5,000 applicants, the school admits 2,500. Even though the acceptance rates differ greatly, the number of applicants is the same. Students should keep data in perspective when comparing schools, rankings, and data points. 2. Check how you (and that percentage from the first point) stack up against the average SAT and GPA of your desired school. Prospective students can find a university's average SAT or GPA score for incoming accepted students. This information can help contextualize the admissions rate percentage. Your scores may stack up well against this data, especially if the average is lower. If the average SAT score is 1450 out of 1600 and the average incoming GPA is 3.7 out of 4.0, then the applicant pool is filled with better applicants and decreases your chances. 3. Evaluate the acceptance percentage compared to actual enrollment. Universities often accept more students than they can take. This is due to the fact that not all students who are accepted will enroll. Evaluating the percentage of those who are enrolled against those accepted provides additional information. If the school has a 50% acceptance rate, but 90% of students enroll (45% of the total applicants), then you may have a different perspective on the college, knowing that most accepted students wish to attend. 4. Evaluate the acceptance rate percentage compared to the school's tuition, fees, and financial aid. Price is one of the most important factors when choosing a college. Looking at tuition, extra fees, and potential financial aid can provide an idea of what it costs. Universities with high price tags and little financial aid available may get fewer applicants. Schools with a lower price tag and substantial financial aid often receive more applicants. Remember that cost does not necessarily speak to a school's education quality. Prospective students should examine these factors together in the schools they are considering. 5. Compare each school's acceptance rate percentage. Always focus on comparing one college to another in each of the criteria outlined above and all of the criteria provided. You can also break down some areas of interest that may be more or less important to you specifically. Ten Schools With the Lowest Acceptance Rates Stanford University with a 4.34% acceptance rate of the 47,498 applicants Harvard University with a 4.92% acceptance rate of the 43,330 applicants Columbia University with a 6.1% acceptance rate of the 36,250 applicants Princeton University with a 6.5% acceptance rate of the 29,303 applicants Yale University with a 6.9% acceptance rate of the 32,900 applicants The Juilliard School with a 7.2% acceptance rate of the 2,597 applicants The University of Chicago with a 7.9% acceptance rate of the 31,411 applicants Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a 7.9% acceptance rate of the 19,020 applicants California Institute of Technology with an 8% acceptance rate of the 6,800+ applicants Brown University with a 9.3% acceptance rate of the 32,390 applicants Benefits of Low College Acceptance Rates The colleges with the lowest acceptance rates also typically feature the greatest prestige and name recognition. This explains why so many Ivy League schools appear on our list of the colleges with the lowest acceptance rates. Attending a selective school can translate into networking and career opportunities after graduation. Thanks to prestigious alumni networks, many of these schools help professionals advance their careers long after graduation. Many of these schools also focus on academic research, investing in the latest technologies and conducting cutting-edge experiments. Students interested in research careers benefit from attending these schools. Attending a selective school may also bring salary benefits. For example, Ivy League graduates report higher earnings than other professionals. Ten years after gaining admission, an Ivy League grad earns double the salary of grads from other colleges. Low acceptance rates also often correlate with high graduation rates. Enrolling at a selective school does not benefit students who drop out and never earn their degree. However, many of the most selective schools report graduation rates of over 90%. Selective schools maintain different standards. Juilliard, for example, requires different qualifications than Harvard or Stanford, and applicants to the performing arts school must pass an audition to gain admission. Applying to Colleges with Low Acceptance Rates In a competitive applicant pool, how can you make your application stand out? Colleges with the lowest acceptance rates look for a strong academic record. Students can consider boosting their GPA by taking AP classes. Transcripts should show the admissions committee that applicants can handle college-level work. Avoiding hard classes can backfire. Taking practice tests or an SAT or ACT prep course can also help students increase their standardized test scores. In addition to academics, schools look for well-rounded applicants who bring something unique to the student body. Highlighting extracurricular activities, volunteer experience, and work experience can help applicants stand out. College essays also play a major role in admissions. Applicants should spend several weeks writing and revising their essays. Ask for feedback from teachers or mentors to improve the essays, and make sure to customize the essay for each school. Recommendation letters can make or break an application. Students should choose teachers or mentors who know them well. Contact letter writers at least one month before the application deadline. Rather than simply asking for the letter, provide as much information as possible. Students should offer a list of their academic achievements, extracurriculars, or papers they wrote for the class. Before submitting an application, prospective students should review the entire application. Sloppy errors draw the wrong kind of attention during the admissions process. Playing the Field When It Comes to Acceptance Rate Rankings In 2015, 36% of first-time college students applied to seven or more colleges. That percentage more than doubled since 2005, when only 17% of first-time freshmen submitted applications at seven or more schools. As college acceptance rates decrease, applicants feel the pressure to increase their chances by applying to more schools. But applying to multiple colleges brings its own challenges. Customizing applications for each school takes time and effort. Applicants can streamline the process by using sites like Common App that provide a single portal to apply to multiple schools. Tracking application requirements, deadlines for recommendation letters, and essay requirements can also help students manage the process. On average, students spend $44 per application. The most selective colleges charge even more, with Stanford commanding a $90 application fee. The financial burden of application fees may prevent students from applying to multiple schools, which can limit their college options. Fortunately, most schools offer application fee waivers for qualifying students. For example, applicants who show economic need can receive a Common App fee waiver. Applicants should avoid only applying to the most selective schools. By also applying to an in-state public school or other institutions with higher acceptance rates, students increase their chances of acceptance. Benefits of Schools with High Acceptance Rates Most schools admit more than two-thirds of their applicants, according to a 2019 Pew Research study. What are the benefits of attending a school with a high acceptance rate? For one, applicants are more likely to get in. Students who only apply to the most selective schools may wind up without an admission offer, which is a real danger when many selective schools admit fewer than one in 10 applicants. A high acceptance rate can benefit students in several other ways. Students with a strong application might be more likely to receive scholarships or merit-based financial aid at a less-selective school. These applicants stand out in the applicant pool when the same GPA and standardized test scores might not impress selective schools. The student body at schools with higher admission rates also looks different. The most selective schools admit more students from high-income households. For example, elite colleges enroll more students from the top 1% than from the bottom 40%, according to The New York Times. Schools with higher admission rates often enroll a more economically diverse student body, and they do a better job of improving the economic outlook for low-income students. In fact, students with strong applications and a solid work ethic tend to do well regardless of the school they attend. A school with a high acceptance rate can help these students reach their academic and professional goals. College Acceptance Rates Do Not Translate to Learning Quality Many students think the most selective colleges are the best. However, admission selectivity does not necessarily translate directly to academic quality and rigor. Several other metrics provide more relevant data about a college's academic quality. For example, prospective students can research the outcomes for the school's alumni. Do they receive job offers in their field? Do they report high admission rates to graduate programs? Other metrics to assess a school's academics include faculty qualifications. Applicants can research the percent of faculty with a terminal degree in their field and the percentage of courses taught by tenured or tenure-track professors as measures of academic quality. Many schools provide this data on their website. Selectivity also does not indicate a student's fit with the school. Factors like the school's size, setting, and policies about on-campus housing can inform prospective students more about their college experience than the school's admission rate. Similarly, less-selective schools with a high mobility rate might do a better job helping lower-income students move into higher income brackets than the most selective colleges. Attending a school with the lowest admission rate does not guarantee academic or career success. While admission rates measure the number of students each institution accepts, the school's retention rate and graduation rate provides more direct information about whether current students thrive at the school. Methodology For each college, we gathered data on the number of full-time faculty per part-time faculty member, institutional financial aid, acceptance, retention, graduation, job placement, default rates, years accredited, and undergraduate tuition.

Founded in 1701 as the Collegiate School, it is the third-oldest institution of higher education in the United States and one of the nine Colonial Colleges chartered before the American Revolution. The Collegiate School was renamed Yale College in 1718 to honor the school's largest private benefactor for the first century of its existence, Elihu Yale.[7][8] Yale University is referred to as a member of the Big Three (colleges) and is considered one of the most prestigious universities in the nation and in the world.[9][10][11][12] Chartered by Connecticut Colony, the Collegiate School was established in 1701 by clergy to educate Congregational ministers before moving to New Haven in 1716. Originally restricted to theology and sacred languages, the curriculum began to incorporate humanities and sciences by the time of the American Revolution. In the 19th century, the college expanded into graduate and professional instruction, awarding the first PhD in the United States in 1861 and organizing as a university in 1887. Yale's faculty and student populations grew after 1890 with rapid expansion of the physical campus and scientific research. Yale is organized into fourteen constituent schools: the original undergraduate college, the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and twelve professional schools. While the university is governed by the Yale Corporation, each school's faculty oversees its curriculum and degree programs. In addition to a central campus in downtown New Haven, the university owns athletic facilities in western New Haven, a campus in West Haven, Connecticut, and forests and nature preserves throughout New England. As of June 2020, the university's endowment was valued at $31.1 billion, the second largest of any educational institution.[1] The Yale University Library, serving all constituent schools, holds more than 15 million volumes and is the third-largest academic library in the United States.[13][14] Students compete in intercollegiate sports as the Yale Bulldogs in the NCAA Division I – Ivy League. As of October 2020, 65 Nobel laureates, five Fields Medalists, four Abel Prize laureates, and three Turing award winners have been affiliated with Yale University. In addition, Yale has graduated many notable alumni, including five U.S. Presidents, 19 U.S. Supreme Court Justices, 31 living billionaires,[15] and many heads of state. Hundreds of members of Congress and many U.S. diplomats, 78 MacArthur Fellows, 252 Rhodes Scholars, 123 Marshall Scholars, and nine Mitchell Scholars have been affiliated with the university.

(July 2021) Early history of Yale College[edit] Origins[edit] Charter creating the Collegiate School, which became Yale College, October 9, 1701 Yale traces its beginnings to ""An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School"", a would-be charter passed during a meeting in New Haven by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut on October 9, 1701. The Act was an effort to create an institution to train ministers and lay leadership for Connecticut. Soon after, a group of ten Congregational ministers, Samuel Andrew, Thomas Buckingham, Israel Chauncy, Samuel Mather (nephew of Increase Mather), Rev. James Noyes II (son of James Noyes), James Pierpont, Abraham Pierson, Noadiah Russell, Joseph Webb, and Timothy Woodbridge, all alumni of Harvard, met in the study of Reverend Samuel Russell, located in Branford, Connecticut, to donate their books to form the school's library.[16] The group, led by James Pierpont, is now known as ""The Founders"".[17] A Front View of Yale-College and the College Chapel, printed by Daniel Bowen in 1786 From its origin it is known as the ""Collegiate School"", the institution opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson, who is today considered the first president of Yale. Pierson lived in Killingworth (now Clinton). The school moved to Saybrook and then Wethersfield. In 1716, it moved to New Haven, Connecticut. Meanwhile, there was a rift forming at Harvard between its sixth president, Increase Mather, and the rest of the Harvard clergy, whom Mather viewed as increasingly liberal, ecclesiastically lax, and overly broad in Church polity. The feud caused the Mathers to champion the success of the Collegiate School in the hope that it would maintain the Puritan religious orthodoxy in a way that Harvard had not.[18] Rev. Jason Haven, the minister at the First Church and Parish in Dedham, Massachusetts had been considered for the presidency on account of his orthodox theology and for ""Neatness dignity and purity of Style [which] surpass those of all that have been mentioned,"" but was passed over due to his ""very Valetudinary and infirm State of Health.""[19] Naming and development[edit] Coat of arms of the family of Elihu Yale, after whom the university was named in 1718 In 1718, at the behest of either Rector Samuel Andrew or the colony's Governor Gurdon Saltonstall, Cotton Mather contacted the successful Boston born businessman Elihu Yale to ask him for financial help in constructing a new building for the college. Through the persuasion of Jeremiah Dummer, Elihu ""Eli"" Yale, who had made a fortune in Madras while working for the East India Company as the first president of Fort St. George (largely through secret contracts with Madras merchants that were illegal under Company policy[20]), donated nine bales of goods, which were sold for more than £560, a substantial sum of money at the time. Cotton Mather suggested that the school change its name to ""Yale College.""[21] The Welsh name Yale is the Anglicized spelling of the Iâl, which the family estate at Plas yn Iâl, near the village of Llandegla, was called. Meanwhile, a Harvard graduate working in England convinced some 180 prominent intellectuals to donate books to Yale. The 1714 shipment of 500 books represented the best of modern English literature, science, philosophy and theology at the time.[22] It had a profound effect on intellectuals at Yale. Undergraduate Jonathan Edwards discovered John Locke's works and developed his original theology known as the ""new divinity."" In 1722 the Rector and six of his friends, who had a study group to discuss the new ideas, announced that they had given up Calvinism, become Arminians, and joined the Church of England. They were ordained in England and returned to the colonies as missionaries for the Anglican faith. Thomas Clapp became president in 1745 and while he attempted to return the college to Calvinist orthodoxy, he did not close the library. Other students found Deist books in the library.[23] Founders' connections to the slave trade[edit] One of Elihu Yale's responsibilities as president of Fort St. George was overseeing its slave trade, though he himself was never a slave trader, never owned slaves, opposed the slave trade, and imposed several restrictions on it during his tenure.[24] Critics nonetheless argue that he benefited from the trade by having it as one of his responsibilities as president, despite not owning any of the traded human beings or profiting from their sales.[25] The controversy over Yale University being named to honor the slave trader Elihu Yale dates back to at least 1994. In 2007, Yale University removed a painting which shows Elihu Yale attended to by a child slave. At the time, Yale University stated that the issues with Elihu Yale had begun at least 13 years prior. Although Elihu Yale was the president of the East India Company, a Yale University spokesperson claimed that, ""...Elihu Yale did not support slavery...""[26] A 2017 Wall Street Journal opinion article also called for renaming Yale University.[27][28] Since 2016, Yale University has acknowledged that Elihu Yale was ""...involved [in] and profited from the slave trade.""[29] The controversy over Yale's name started anew in 2020 with a Yale Daily News post, ""Yale Has to Go!""[30] After years of protest, Yale University renamed Calhoun College as Hopper College in 2017. Calhoun College was named for a South Carolina slave owner and anti-abolitionist, Vice President John C. Calhoun.[31][32][33] Yale University also acquired a slave plantation to finance its graduate program.[34] Yale University has multiple other buildings named to honor slave owners, including Bishop George Berkeley, Timothy Dwight and Ezra Stiles.[35] Curriculum[edit] Connecticut Hall, oldest building on the Yale campus, built between 1750 and 1753 First diploma awarded by Yale College, granted to Nathaniel Chauncey in 1702 Yale College undergraduates follow a liberal arts curriculum with departmental majors and is organized into a social system of residential colleges. Yale was swept up by the great intellectual movements of the period—the Great Awakening and the Enlightenment—due to the religious and scientific interests of presidents Thomas Clap and Ezra Stiles. They were both instrumental in developing the scientific curriculum at Yale while dealing with wars, student tumults, graffiti, ""irrelevance"" of curricula, desperate need for endowment and disagreements with the Connecticut legislature.[36][37][page needed] Serious American students of theology and divinity, particularly in New England, regarded Hebrew as a classical language, along with Greek and Latin, and essential for the study of the Old Testament in the original words. The Reverend Ezra Stiles, president of the college from 1778 to 1795, brought with him his interest in the Hebrew language as a vehicle for studying ancient Biblical texts in their original language (as was common in other schools), requiring all freshmen to study Hebrew (in contrast to Harvard, where only upperclassmen were required to study the language) and is responsible for the Hebrew phrase אורים ותמים (Urim and Thummim) on the Yale seal. A 1746 graduate of Yale, Stiles came to the college with experience in education, having played an integral role in the founding of Brown University, in addition to having been a minister.[38] Stiles' greatest challenge occurred in July 1779 when British forces occupied New Haven and threatened to raze the college. However, Yale graduate Edmund Fanning, Secretary to the British General in command of the occupation, intervened and the college was saved. In 1803, Fanning was granted an honorary degree LL.D. for his efforts.[39] Students[edit] As the only college in Connecticut from 1701 to 1823, Yale educated the sons of the elite.[40] Punishable offenses for students included cardplaying, tavern-going, destruction of college property, and acts of disobedience to college authorities. During this period, Harvard was distinctive for the stability and maturity of its tutor corps, while Yale had youth and zeal on its side.[41] The emphasis on classics gave rise to a number of private student societies, open only by invitation, which arose primarily as forums for discussions of modern scholarship, literature and politics. The first such organizations were debating societies: Crotonia in 1738, Linonia in 1753 and Brothers in Unity in 1768. While the societies no longer exist, commemorations to them can be found with names given to campus structures, like Brothers in Unity Courtyard in Branford College. 19th century[edit] Old Brick Row in 1807 The Yale Report of 1828 was a dogmatic defense of the Latin and Greek curriculum against critics who wanted more courses in modern languages, mathematics, and science. Unlike higher education in Europe, there was no national curriculum for colleges and universities in the United States. In the competition for students and financial support, college leaders strove to keep current with demands for innovation. At the same time, they realized that a significant portion of their students and prospective students demanded a classical background. The Yale report meant the classics would not be abandoned. During this period, all institutions experimented with changes in the curriculum, often resulting in a dual-track curriculum. In the decentralized environment of higher education in the United States, balancing change with tradition was a common challenge because it was difficult for an institution to be completely modern or completely classical.[42][43] A group of professors at Yale and New Haven Congregationalist ministers articulated a conservative response to the changes brought about by the Victorian culture. They concentrated on developing a person possessed of religious values strong enough to sufficiently resist temptations from within, yet flexible enough to adjust to the 'isms' (professionalism, materialism, individualism, and consumerism) tempting him from without.[44][page needed] William Graham Sumner, professor from 1872 to 1909, taught in the emerging disciplines of economics and sociology to overflowing classrooms of students. Sumner bested President Noah Porter, who disliked the social sciences and wanted Yale to lock into its traditions of classical education. Porter objected to Sumner's use of a textbook by Herbert Spencer that espoused agnostic materialism because it might harm students.[45] Until 1887, the legal name of the university was ""The President and Fellows of Yale College, in New Haven."" In 1887, under an act passed by the Connecticut General Assembly, Yale was renamed to the present ""Yale University.""[46] Sports and debate[edit] The Revolutionary War soldier Nathan Hale (Yale 1773) was the archetype of the Yale ideal in the early 19th century: a manly yet aristocratic scholar, equally well-versed in knowledge and sports, and a patriot who ""regretted"" that he ""had but one life to lose"" for his country. Western painter Frederic Remington (Yale 1900) was an artist whose heroes gloried in the combat and tests of strength in the Wild West. The fictional, turn-of-the-20th-century Yale man Frank Merriwell embodied this same heroic ideal without racial prejudice, and his fictional successor Frank Stover in the novel Stover at Yale (1911) questioned the business mentality that had become prevalent at the school. Increasingly the students turned to athletic stars as their heroes, especially since winning the big game became the goal of the student body, the alumni, and the team itself.[47] Yale's four-oared crew team posing with the 1876 Centennial Regatta trophy, won in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Along with Harvard and Princeton, Yale students rejected British concepts about 'amateurism' in sports and constructed athletic programs that were uniquely American, such as football.[48][page needed] The Harvard–Yale football rivalry began in 1875. Between 1892, when Harvard and Yale met in one of the first intercollegiate debates,[49][page needed] and in 1909 (the year of the first Triangular Debate of Harvard, Yale and Princeton) the rhetoric, symbolism, and metaphors used in athletics were used to frame these early debates. Debates were covered on front pages of college newspapers and emphasized in yearbooks, and team members even received the equivalent of athletic letters for their jackets. There were also rallies to send off the debating teams to matches, but the debates never attained the broad appeal that athletics enjoyed. One reason may be that debates do not have a clear winner, as is the case in sports, and that scoring is subjective. In addition, with late 19th-century concerns about the impact of modern life on the human body, athletics offered hope that neither the individual nor the society was coming apart.[50] In 1909–10, football faced a crisis resulting from the failure of the previous reforms of 1905–06, which sought to solve the problem of serious injuries. There was a mood of alarm and mistrust, and, while the crisis was developing, the presidents of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton developed a project to reform the sport and forestall possible radical changes forced by government upon the sport. Presidents Arthur Hadley of Yale, A. Lawrence Lowell of Harvard, and Woodrow Wilson of Princeton worked to develop moderate reforms to reduce injuries. Their attempts, however, were reduced by rebellion against the rules committee and the formation of the Intercollegiate Athletic Association. While the big three had attempted to operate independently of the majority, the changes pushed did reduce injuries.[51] Expansion[edit] Starting with the addition of the Yale School of Medicine in 1810, the college expanded gradually from then on, establishing the Yale Divinity School in 1822, Yale Law School in 1822, the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in 1847, the now-defunct Sheffield Scientific School in 1847,[52] and the Yale School of Fine Arts in 1869. In 1887, under the presidency of Timothy Dwight V, Yale College was renamed to Yale University, and the former name was subsequently applied only to the undergraduate college. The university would continue to expand greatly into the 20th and 21st century, adding the Yale School of Music in 1894, the Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies in 1900, the Yale School of Public Health in 1915, the Yale School of Architecture in 1916, the Yale School of Nursing 1923, the Yale School of Drama in 1955, the Yale School of Management in 1976, and the Jackson School of Global Affairs which is planned to open in 2022.[53] The Sheffield Scientific School would also reorganize its relationship with the university to teach only undergraduate courses. Expansion caused controversy about Yale's new roles. Noah Porter, a moral philosopher, was president from 1871 to 1886. During an age of tremendous expansion in higher education, Porter resisted the rise of the new research university, claiming that an eager embrace of its ideals would corrupt undergraduate education. Many of Porter's contemporaries criticized his administration, and historians since have disparaged his leadership.[citation needed] Historian George Levesque argues Porter was not a simple-minded reactionary, uncritically committed to tradition, but a principled and selective conservative.[54][page needed] Levesque continues, saying he did not endorse everything old or reject everything new; rather, he sought to apply long-established ethical and pedagogical principles to a rapidly changing culture. Levesque concludes, mention how he may have misunderstood some of the challenges of his time, but he correctly anticipated the enduring tensions that have accompanied the emergence and growth of the modern university. 20th century[edit] Medicine[edit] Woolsey Hall c. 1905 Milton Winternitz led the Yale School of Medicine as its dean from 1920 to 1935. Dedicated to the new scientific medicine established in Germany, he was equally fervent about ""social medicine"" and the study of humans in their culture and environment. He established the ""Yale System"" of teaching, with few lectures and fewer exams, and strengthened the full-time faculty system; he also created the graduate-level Yale School of Nursing and the Psychiatry Department and built numerous new buildings. Progress toward his plans for an Institute of Human Relations, envisioned as a refuge where social scientists would collaborate with biological scientists in a holistic study of humankind, unfortunately, lasted for only a few years before the opposition of resentful anti-Semitic colleagues drove him to resign.[55] Faculty[edit] Richard Rummell's 1906 watercolor of the Yale campus facing northBefore World War II, most elite university faculties counted among their numbers few, if any, Jews, blacks, women, or other minorities; Yale was no exception. By 1980, this condition had been altered dramatically, as numerous members of those groups held faculty positions.[56] Almost all members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences—and some members of other faculties—teach undergraduate courses, more than 2,000 of which are offered annually.[57] Women[edit] In 1793, Lucinda Foote passed the entrance exams for Yale College, but was rejected by the President on the basis of her gender.[58] Women studied at Yale University as early as 1892, in graduate-level programs at the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.[59] In 1966, Yale began discussions with its sister school Vassar College about merging to foster coeducation at the undergraduate level. Vassar, then all-female and part of the Seven Sisters—elite higher education schools that historically served as sister institutions to the Ivy League when most Ivy League institutions still only admitted men—tentatively accepted, but then declined the invitation. Both schools introduced coeducation independently in 1969.[60] Amy Solomon was the first woman to register as a Yale undergraduate;[61] she was also the first woman at Yale to join an undergraduate society, St. Anthony Hall. The undergraduate class of 1973 was the first class to have women starting from freshman year;[62] at the time, all undergraduate women were housed in Vanderbilt Hall at the south end of Old Campus.[63] A decade into co-education, student assault and harassment by faculty became the impetus for the trailblazing lawsuit Alexander v. Yale. In the late 1970s, a group of students and one faculty member sued Yale for its failure to curtail campus sexual harassment by especially male faculty. The case was party built from a 1977 report authored by plaintiff Ann Olivarius, now a feminist attorney known for fighting sexual harassment, ""A report to the Yale Corporation from the Yale Undergraduate Women's Caucus.""[64] This case was the first to use Title IX to argue and establish that the sexual harassment of female students can be considered illegal sex discrimination. The plaintiffs in the case were Olivarius, Ronni Alexander (now a professor at Kobe University, Japan), Margery Reifler (works in the Los Angeles film industry), Pamela Price (civil rights attorney in California), and Lisa E. Stone (works at Anti-Defamation League). They were joined by Yale classics professor John “Jack” J. Winkler, who died in 1990. The lawsuit, brought partly by Catharine MacKinnon, alleged rape, fondling, and offers of higher grades for sex by several Yale faculty, including Keith Brion, professor of flute and Director of Bands, Political Science professor Raymond Duvall (now at the University of Minnesota), English professor Michael Cooke, and coach of the field hockey team, Richard Kentwell. While unsuccessful in the courts, the legal reasoning behind the case changed the landscape of sex discrimination law and resulted in the establishment of Yale's Grievance Board and the Yale Women's Center.[65] In March 2011 a Title IX complaint was filed against Yale by students and recent graduates, including editors of Yale's feminist magazine Broad Recognition, alleging that the university had a hostile sexual climate.[66] In response, the university formed a Title IX steering committee to address complaints of sexual misconduct.[67] Afterwards, universities and colleges throughout the US also established sexual harassment grievance procedures. Class[edit] Yale, like other Ivy League schools, instituted policies in the early 20th century designed to maintain the proportion of white Protestants from notable families in the student body (see numerus clausus), and was one of the last of the Ivies to eliminate such preferences, beginning with the class of 1970.[68] 21st century[edit] In 2006, Yale and Peking University (PKU) established a Joint Undergraduate Program in Beijing, an exchange program allowing Yale students to spend a semester living and studying with PKU honor students.[69] In July 2012, the Yale University-PKU Program ended due to weak participation.[69] In 2007 outgoing Yale President Rick Levin characterized Yale's institutional priorities: ""First, among the nation's finest research universities, Yale is distinctively committed to excellence in undergraduate education. Second, in our graduate and professional schools, as well as in Yale College, we are committed to the education of leaders.""[70] In 2009, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair picked Yale as one location – the others being Britain's Durham University and Universiti Teknologi Mara – for the Tony Blair Faith Foundation's United States Faith and Globalization Initiative.[71] As of 2009, former Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo is the director of the Yale Center for the Study of Globalization and teaches an undergraduate seminar, ""Debating Globalization"".[72] As of 2009, former presidential candidate and DNC chair Howard Dean teaches a residential college seminar, ""Understanding Politics and Politicians"".[73] Also in 2009, an alliance was formed among Yale, University College London, and both schools' affiliated hospital complexes to conduct research focused on the direct improvement of patient care—a growing field known as translational medicine. President Richard Levin noted that Yale has hundreds of other partnerships across the world, but ""no existing collaboration matches the scale of the new partnership with UCL"".[74] In August 2013, a new partnership with the National University of Singapore led to the opening of Yale-NUS College in Singapore, a joint effort to create a new liberal arts college in Asia featuring a curriculum including both Western and Asian traditions.[75] In 2020, in the wake of protests around the world focused on racial relations and criminal justice reform, the #CancelYale tag was used on social media to demand that Elihu Yale's name be removed from Yale University. Most support for the change stemmed from politically conservative pundits, such as Mike Cernovich and Ann Coulter, satirizing perceived excesses of online cancel culture.[76] Yale was president of the East India Company, a trading company that traded slaves as well as goods, [77] and his singularly large donation[78][79] led to Yale relying on money from the slave-trade for its first scholarships and endowments.[25][80] In August 2020, the US Justice Department claimed that Yale discriminated against Asian and white candidates on the basis of their race. The university, however, denied the report.[81] In early February 2021, under the new Biden administration, the Justice Department withdrew the lawsuit. The group, Students for Fair Admissions, known for a similar lawsuit against Harvard alleging the same issue, plans to refile the lawsuit.[82] Yale alumni in politics[edit] The Boston Globe wrote that ""if there's one school that can lay claim to educating the nation's top national leaders over the past three decades, it's Yale"".[83][verification needed] Yale alumni were represented on the Democratic or Republican ticket in every U.S. presidential election between 1972 and 2004.[84] Yale-educated Presidents since the end of the Vietnam War include Gerald Ford, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush, and major-party nominees during this period include Hillary Clinton (2016), John Kerry (2004), Joseph Lieberman (Vice President, 2000), and Sargent Shriver (Vice President, 1972). Other Yale alumni who have made serious bids for the Presidency during this period include Amy Klobuchar (2020), Tom Steyer (2020), Ben Carson (2016), Howard Dean (2004), Gary Hart (1984 and 1988), Paul Tsongas (1992), Pat Robertson (1988) and Jerry Brown (1976, 1980, 1992). Several explanations have been offered for Yale's representation in national elections since the end of the Vietnam War. Various sources note the spirit of campus activism that has existed at Yale since the 1960s, and the intellectual influence of Reverend William Sloane Coffin on many of the future candidates.[85][verification needed] Yale President Richard Levin attributes the run to Yale's focus on creating ""a laboratory for future leaders,"" an institutional priority that began during the tenure of Yale Presidents Alfred Whitney Griswold and Kingman Brewster.[85] Richard H. Brodhead, former dean of Yale College and now president of Duke University, stated: ""We do give very significant attention to orientation to the community in our admissions, and there is a very strong tradition of volunteerism at Yale.""[83] Yale historian Gaddis Smith notes ""an ethos of organized activity"" at Yale during the 20th century that led John Kerry to lead the Yale Political Union's Liberal Party, George Pataki the Conservative Party, and Joseph Lieberman to manage the Yale Daily News.[86] Camille Paglia points to a history of networking and elitism: ""It has to do with a web of friendships and affiliations built up in school.""[87] CNN suggests that George W. Bush benefited from preferential admissions policies for the ""son and grandson of alumni"", and for a ""member of a politically influential family"".[88] New York Times correspondent Elisabeth Bumiller and The Atlantic Monthly correspondent James Fallows credit the culture of community and cooperation that exists between students, faculty, and administration, which downplays self-interest and reinforces commitment to others.[89] During the 1988 presidential election, George H. W. Bush (Yale '48) derided Michael Dukakis for having ""foreign-policy views born in Harvard Yard's boutique"". When challenged on the distinction between Dukakis' Harvard connection and his own Yale background, he said that, unlike Harvard, Yale's reputation was ""so diffuse, there isn't a symbol, I don't think, in the Yale situation, any symbolism in it"" and said Yale did not share Harvard's reputation for ""liberalism and elitism"".[90] In 2004 Howard Dean stated, ""In some ways, I consider myself separate from the other three (Yale) candidates of 2004. Yale changed so much between the class of '68 and the class of '71. My class was the first class to have women in it; it was the first class to have a significant effort to recruit African Americans. It was an extraordinary time, and in that span of time is the change of an entire generation"".[89] Administration and organization[edit] Leadership[edit] School founding School Year founded Yale College 1701 Yale School of Medicine 1810 Yale Divinity School 1822 Yale Law School 1843 Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences 1847 Sheffield Scientific School[52] 1847 Yale School of Fine Arts 1869 Yale School of Music 1894 Yale School of the Environment 1900 Yale School of Public Health 1915 Yale School of Architecture 1916 Yale School of Nursing 1923 David Geffen School of Drama at Yale University 1955 Yale School of Management 1976 Jackson School of Global Affairs Planned for fall 2022[53] The President and Fellows of Yale College, also known as the Yale Corporation, or board of trustees, is the governing body of the university and consists of thirteen standing committees with separate responsibilities outlined in the by-laws. The corporation has 19 members: three ex officio members, ten successor trustees, and six elected alumni fellows.[91] The university has three major academic components: Yale College (the undergraduate program), the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and the twelve professional schools.[92] Yale's former president Richard C. Levin was, at the time, one of the highest paid university presidents in the United States with a 2008 salary of $1.5 million.[93] Yale's succeeding president Peter Salovey ranks 40th with a 2020 salary of $1.16 million.[94] The Yale Provost's Office and similar executive positions have launched several women into prominent university executive positions. In 1977, Provost Hanna Holborn Gray was appointed interim President of Yale and later went on to become President of the University of Chicago, being the first woman to hold either position at each respective school.[95][96] In 1994, Provost Judith Rodin became the first permanent female president of an Ivy League institution at the University of Pennsylvania.[97] In 2002, Provost Alison Richard became the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge.[98] In 2003, the Dean of the Divinity School, Rebecca Chopp, was appointed president of Colgate University and later went on to serve as the President of the Swarthmore College in 2009, and then the first female chancellor of the University of Denver in 2014.[99] In 2004, Provost Dr. Susan Hockfield became the President of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.[100] In 2004, Dean of the Nursing school, Catherine Gilliss, was appointed the Dean of Duke University's School of Nursing and Vice Chancellor for Nursing Affairs.[101] In 2007, Deputy Provost H. Kim Bottomly was named President of Wellesley College.[102] Similar examples for men who've served in Yale leadership positions can also be found. In 2004, Dean of Yale College Richard H. Brodhead was appointed as the President of Duke University.[103] In 2008, Provost Andrew Hamilton was confirmed to be the Vice Chancellor of the University of Oxford.[104] Staff and labor unions[edit] See also: Federation of Hospital and University Employees Yale University staff are represented by several different unions. Clerical and technical workers are represented by Local 34, and service and maintenance workers are represented by Local 35, both of the same union affiliate UNITE HERE.[105] Unlike similar institutions, Yale has consistently refused to recognize its graduate student union, Local 33 (another affiliate of UNITE HERE), citing claims that the union's elections were undemocratic and how graduate students are not employees;[106][107] the move to not recognize the union has been criticized by the American Federation of Teachers.[108] In addition, officers of the Yale University Police Department are represented by the Yale Police Benevolent Association, which affiliated in 2005 with the Connecticut Organization for Public Safety Employees.[105][109] Yale security officers joined the International Union of Security, Police and Fire Professionals of America in late 2010,[110] even though the Yale administration contested the election.[111] In October 2014, after deliberation,[112] Yale security decided to form a new union, the Yale University Security Officers Association, which has since represented the campus security officers.[105][113] Yale has a history of difficult and prolonged labor negotiations, often culminating in strikes.[114][page needed] There have been at least eight strikes since 1968, and The New York Times wrote that Yale has a reputation as having the worst record of labor tension of any university in the U.S.[115] Moreover, Yale has been accused by the AFL–CIO of failing to treat workers with respect,[116] as well as not renewing contracts with professors over involvement in campus labor issues.[117] Yale has responded to strikes with claims over mediocre union participation and the benefits of their contracts.[118] Campus[edit] Yale Law School, located in the Sterling Law Building Interior of Beinecke Library Yale's central campus in downtown New Haven covers 260 acres (1.1 km2) and comprises its main, historic campus and a medical campus adjacent to the Yale–New Haven Hospital. In western New Haven, the university holds 500 acres (2.0 km2) of athletic facilities, including the Yale Golf Course.[119] In 2008, Yale purchased the 17-building, 136-acre (0.55 km2) former Bayer HealthCare complex in West Haven, Connecticut,[120] the buildings of which are now used as laboratory and research space.[121] Yale also owns seven forests in Connecticut, Vermont, and New Hampshire—the largest of which is the 7,840-acre (31.7 km2) Yale-Myers Forest in Connecticut's Quiet Corner—and nature preserves including Horse Island.[122] Yale is noted for its largely Collegiate Gothic campus[123] as well as several iconic modern buildings commonly discussed in architectural history survey courses: Louis Kahn's Yale Art Gallery[124] and Center for British Art, Eero Saarinen's Ingalls Rink and Ezra Stiles and Morse Colleges, and Paul Rudolph's Art & Architecture Building. Yale also owns and has restored many noteworthy 19th-century mansions along Hillhouse Avenue, which was considered the most beautiful street in America by Charles Dickens when he visited the United States in the 1840s.[125] In 2011, Travel+Leisure listed the Yale campus as one of the most beautiful in the United States.[126] Many of Yale's buildings were constructed in the Collegiate Gothic architecture style from 1917 to 1931, financed largely by Edward S. Harkness, including the Yale Drama School.[127][128] Stone sculpture built into the walls of the buildings portray contemporary college personalities, such as a writer, an athlete, a tea-drinking socialite, and a student who has fallen asleep while reading. Similarly, the decorative friezes on the buildings depict contemporary scenes, like a policemen chasing a robber and arresting a prostitute (on the wall of the Law School), or a student relaxing with a mug of beer and a cigarette. The architect, James Gamble Rogers, faux-aged these buildings by splashing the walls with acid,[129] deliberately breaking their leaded glass windows and repairing them in the style of the Middle Ages, and creating niches for decorative statuary but leaving them empty to simulate loss or theft over the ages. In fact, the buildings merely simulate Middle Ages architecture, for though they appear to be constructed of solid stone blocks in the authentic manner, most actually have steel framing as was commonly used in 1930. One exception is Harkness Tower, 216 feet (66 m) tall, which was originally a free-standing stone structure. It was reinforced in 1964 to allow the installation of the Yale Memorial Carillon Statue of Nathan Hale in front of Connecticut Hall Vanderbilt Hall Other examples of the Gothic style are on the Old Campus by architects like Henry Austin, Charles C. Haight and Russell Sturgis. Several are associated with members of the Vanderbilt family, including Vanderbilt Hall,[130] Phelps Hall,[131] St. Anthony Hall (a commission for member Frederick William Vanderbilt), the Mason, Sloane and Osborn laboratories, dormitories for the Sheffield Scientific School (the engineering and sciences school at Yale until 1956) and elements of Silliman College, the largest residential college.[132] The oldest building on campus, Connecticut Hall (built in 1750), is in the Georgian style. Georgian-style buildings erected from 1929 to 1933 include Timothy Dwight College, Pierson College, and Davenport College, except the latter's east, York Street façade, which was constructed in the Gothic style to coordinate with adjacent structures. The Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, designed by Gordon Bunshaft of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, is one of the largest buildings in the world reserved exclusively for the preservation of rare books and manuscripts. The library includes a six-story above-ground tower of book stacks, filled with 180,000 volumes, that is surrounded by large translucent Vermont marble panels and a steel and granite truss. The panels act as windows and subdue direct sunlight while also diffusing the light in warm hues throughout the interior.[133] Near the library is a sunken courtyard, with sculptures by Isamu Noguchi that are said to represent time (the pyramid), the sun (the circle), and chance (the cube).[134] The library is located near the center of the university in Hewitt Quadrangle, which is now more commonly referred to as ""Beinecke Plaza."" Alumnus Eero Saarinen, Finnish-American architect of such notable structures as the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, Washington Dulles International Airport main terminal, Bell Labs Holmdel Complex and the CBS Building in Manhattan, designed Ingalls Rink, dedicated in 1959,[135] as well as the residential colleges Ezra Stiles and Morse.[136] These latter were modeled after the medieval Italian hill town of San Gimignano – a prototype chosen for the town's pedestrian-friendly milieu and fortress-like stone towers.[137] These tower forms at Yale act in counterpoint to the college's many Gothic spires and Georgian cupolas.[138] Yale's Old Campus at dusk, April 2013 Notable nonresidential campus buildings[edit] Harkness Tower Notable nonresidential campus buildings and landmarks include Battell Chapel, Beinecke Rare Book Library, Harkness Tower, Ingalls Rink, Kline Biology Tower, Osborne Memorial Laboratories, Payne Whitney Gymnasium, Peabody Museum of Natural History, Sterling Hall of Medicine, Sterling Law Buildings, Sterling Memorial Library, Woolsey Hall, Yale Center for British Art, Yale University Art Gallery, Yale Art & Architecture Building, and the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art in London. Yale's secret society buildings (some of which are called ""tombs"") were built both to be private yet unmistakable. A diversity of architectural styles is represented: Berzelius, Donn Barber in an austere cube with classical detailing (erected in 1908 or 1910); Book and Snake, Louis R. Metcalfe in a Greek Ionic style (erected in 1901); Elihu, architect unknown but built in a Colonial style (constructed on an early 17th-century foundation although the building is from the 18th century); Mace and Chain, in a late colonial, early Victorian style (built in 1823). (Interior moulding is said to have belonged to Benedict Arnold);Manuscript Society, King Lui-Wu with Dan Kniley responsible for landscaping and Josef Albers for the brickwork intaglio mural. Building constructed in a mid-century modern style; Scroll and Key, Richard Morris Hunt in a Moorish- or Islamic-inspired Beaux-Arts style (erected 1869–70); Skull and Bones, possibly Alexander Jackson Davis or Henry Austin in an Egypto-Doric style utilizing Brownstone (in 1856 the first wing was completed, in 1903 the second wing, 1911 the Neo-Gothic towers in rear garden were completed); St. Elmo, (former tomb) Kenneth M. Murchison, 1912, designs inspired by Elizabethan manor. Current location, brick colonial; and Wolf's Head, Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue, erected 1923–1924, Collegiate Gothic. Sustainability[edit] Yale's Office of Sustainability develops and implements sustainability practices at Yale.[139] Yale is committed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 10% below 1990 levels by the year 2020. As part of this commitment, the university allocates renewable energy credits to offset some of the energy used by residential colleges.[140] Eleven campus buildings are candidates for LEED design and certification.[141] Yale Sustainable Food Project initiated the introduction of local, organic vegetables, fruits, and beef to all residential college dining halls.[142] Yale was listed as a Campus Sustainability Leader on the Sustainable Endowments Institute's College Sustainability Report Card 2008, and received a ""B+"" grade overall.[143] Grove Street Cemetery, New Haven Marsh Botanical Garden Yale Sustainable Food Program Farm Relationship with New Haven[edit] Yale is the largest taxpayer and employer in the City of New Haven,[144] and has often buoyed the city's economy and communities. Yale, however has consistently opposed paying a tax on its academic property.[145] Yale's Art Galleries, along with many other university resources, are free and openly accessible. Yale also funds the New Haven Promise program, paying full tuition for eligible students from New Haven public schools.[146] Town–gown relations[edit] Yale has a complicated relationship with its home city; for example, thousands of students volunteer every year in a myriad of community organizations, but city officials, who decry Yale's exemption from local property taxes, have long pressed the university to do more to help. Under President Levin, Yale has financially supported many of New Haven's efforts to reinvigorate the city. Evidence suggests that the town and gown relationships are mutually beneficial. Still, the economic power of the university increased dramatically with its financial success amid a decline in the local economy.[147] Campus safety[edit] Several campus safety strategies have been pioneered at Yale. The first campus police force was founded at Yale in 1894, when the university contracted city police officers to exclusively cover the campus.[148][149] Later hired by the university, the officers were originally brought in to quell unrest between students and city residents and curb destructive student behavior.[150][151] In addition to the Yale Police Department, a variety of safety services are available including blue phones, a safety escort, and 24-hour shuttle service. In the 1970s and 1980s, poverty and violent crime rose in New Haven, dampening Yale's student and faculty recruiting efforts.[152] Between 1990 and 2006, New Haven's crime rate fell by half, helped by a community policing strategy by the New Haven Police and Yale's campus became the safest among the Ivy League and other peer schools.[153] In 2004, the national non-profit watchdog group Security on Campus filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education, accusing Yale of under-reporting rape and sexual assaults.[154][155] In April 2021, Yale announced that it will require students to receive a COVID-19 vaccine as a condition of being on campus during the fall 2021 term.[156] Academics[edit] Admissions[edit] Admissions statistics2020 enteringclass[157]Change vs.2015[158]Admit rate6.5% ( −0.2)Yield rate54.9% ( −12)Test scores middle 50%SAT EBRW720–780SAT Math740–800ACT Composite33–35High school GPATop 10%†94% ( −3)†Among students whose school ranked Undergraduate admission to Yale College is considered ""most selective"" by U.S. News.[159][160] In 2017, Yale accepted 2,285 students to the Class of 2021 out of 32,914 applicants, for an acceptance rate of 6.9%.[161] 98% of students graduate within six years.[162] Through its program of need-based financial aid, Yale commits to meet the full demonstrated financial need of all applicants. Most financial aid is in the form of grants and scholarships that do not need to be paid back to the university, and the average need-based aid grant for the Class of 2017 was $46,395.[163] 15% of Yale College students are expected to have no parental contribution, and about 50% receive some form of financial aid.[162][164][165] About 16% of the Class of 2013 had some form of student loan debt at graduation, with an average debt of $13,000 among borrowers.[162] Half of all Yale undergraduates are women, more than 39% are ethnic minority U.S. citizens (19% are underrepresented minorities), and 10.5% are international students.[163] 55% attended public schools and 45% attended private, religious, or international schools, and 97% of students were in the top 10% of their high school class.[162] Every year, Yale College also admits a small group of non-traditional students through the Eli Whitney Students Program. Collections[edit] Yale University's Sterling Memorial Library, as seen from Maya Lin's sculpture, Women's Table. The sculpture records the number of women enrolled at Yale over its history; female undergraduates were not admitted until 1969. Yale University Library, which holds over 15 million volumes, is the third-largest university collection in the United States.[13][166] The main library, Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes, and other holdings are dispersed at subject libraries. Rare books are found in several Yale collections. The Beinecke Rare Book Library has a large collection of rare books and manuscripts. The Harvey Cushing/John Hay Whitney Medical Library includes important historical medical texts, including an impressive collection of rare books, as well as historical medical instruments. The Lewis Walpole Library contains the largest collection of 18th‑century British literary works. The Elizabethan Club, technically a private organization, makes its Elizabethan folios and first editions available to qualified researchers through Yale. The Night Café, Vincent van Gogh, 1888, Yale Art Gallery Yale's museum collections are also of international stature. The Yale University Art Gallery, the country's first university-affiliated art museum, contains more than 200,000 works, including Old Masters and important collections of modern art, in the Swartwout and Kahn buildings. The latter, Louis Kahn's first large-scale American work (1953), was renovated and reopened in December 2006. The Yale Center for British Art, the largest collection of British art outside of the UK, grew from a gift of Paul Mellon and is housed in another Kahn-designed building. The Peabody Museum of Natural History in New Haven is used by school children and contains research collections in anthropology, archaeology, and the natural environment. The Yale University Collection of Musical Instruments, affiliated with the Yale School of Music, is perhaps the least-known of Yale's collections because its hours of opening are restricted. The museums once housed the artifacts brought to the United States from Peru by Yale history professor Hiram Bingham in his Yale-financed expedition to Machu Picchu in 1912 – when the removal of such artifacts was legal. The artifacts were restored to Peru in 2012.[167] Academic rankings National ARWU[168] 9 Forbes[169] 3 THE/WSJ[170] 3 U.S. News & World Report[171] 4 Washington Monthly[172] 4 Global ARWU[173] 11 QS[174] 14 THE[175] 8 U.S. News & World Report[176] 11 USNWR graduate school rankings[177] Business 9 Engineering 39 Law 1 Medicine: Primary Care 49 Medicine: Research 15 Nursing: Doctorate 17 Nursing: Master's 14 Rankings[edit] USNWR departmental rankings[177] Biological Sciences 6 Chemistry 9 Clinical Psychology 18 Computer Science 20 Earth Sciences 13 Economics 1 English 8 Fine Arts 2 History 1 Mathematics 9 Nursing–Midwifery 2 Physician Assistant 26 Physics 12 Political Science 4 Psychology 3 Public Health 15 Sociology 22 Statistics 31 The U.S. News & World Report ranked Yale 3rd among U.S. national universities for 2016,[159] as it had for each of the previous sixteen years.

(March 2021) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Yale is a member of the Association of American Universities (AAU) and is classified among ""R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity"".[184] According to the National Science Foundation, Yale spent $990 million on research and development in 2018, ranking it 15th in the nation.[185] Yale's faculty include 61 members of the National Academy of Sciences,[186] 7 members of the National Academy of Engineering[187] and 49 members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. The college is, after normalization for institution size, the tenth-largest baccalaureate source of doctoral degree recipients in the United States, and the largest such source within the Ivy League.[188] Yale's English and Comparative Literature departments were part of the New Criticism movement. Of the New Critics, Robert Penn Warren, W.K. Wimsatt, and Cleanth Brooks were all Yale faculty. Later, the Yale Comparative literature department became a center of American deconstruction. Jacques Derrida, the father of deconstruction, taught at the Department of Comparative Literature from the late seventies to mid-1980s. Several other Yale faculty members were also associated with deconstruction, forming the so-called ""Yale School"". These included Paul de Man who taught in the Departments of Comparative Literature and French, J. Hillis Miller, Geoffrey Hartman (both taught in the Departments of English and Comparative Literature), and Harold Bloom (English), whose theoretical position was always somewhat specific, and who ultimately took a very different path from the rest of this group. Yale's history department has also originated important intellectual trends. Historians C. Vann Woodward and David Brion Davis are credited with beginning in the 1960s and 1970s an important stream of southern historians; likewise, David Montgomery, a labor historian, advised many of the current generation of labor historians in the country. Yale's Music School and Department fostered the growth of Music Theory in the latter half of the 20th century. The Journal of Music Theory was founded there in 1957; Allen Forte and David Lewin were influential teachers and scholars. In addition to eminent faculty members, Yale research relies heavily on the presence of roughly 1200 Postdocs from various national and international origin working in the multiple laboratories in the sciences, social sciences, humanities, and professional schools of the university. The university progressively recognized this working force with the recent creation of the Office for Postdoctoral Affairs and the Yale Postdoctoral Association. Campus life[edit] Yale is a research university, with the majority of its students in the graduate and professional schools. Undergraduates, or Yale College students, come from a variety of ethnic, national, socioeconomic, and personal backgrounds. Of the 2010–2011 freshman class, 10% are non‑U.S. citizens, while 54% went to public high schools.[189] The median family income of Yale students is $192,600, with 57% of students coming from the top 10% highest-earning families and 16% from the bottom 60%.[190] Residential colleges[edit] Main article: Residential colleges of Yale University Yale's residential college system was established in 1933 by Edward S. Harkness, who admired the social intimacy of Oxford and Cambridge and donated significant funds to found similar colleges at Yale and Harvard. Though Yale's colleges resemble their English precursors organizationally and architecturally, they are dependent entities of Yale College and have limited autonomy. The colleges are led by a head and an academic dean, who reside in the college, and university faculty and affiliates constitute each college's fellowship. Colleges offer their own seminars, social events, and speaking engagements known as ""Master's Teas,"" but do not contain programs of study or academic departments. All other undergraduate courses are taught by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and are open to members of any college. All undergraduates are members of a college, to which they are assigned before their freshman year, and 85 percent live in the college quadrangle or a college-affiliated dormitory.[191] While the majority of upperclassman live in the colleges, most on-campus freshmen live on the Old Campus, the university's oldest precinct. While Harkness' original colleges were Georgian Revival or Collegiate Gothic in style, two colleges constructed in the 1960s, Morse and Ezra Stiles Colleges, have modernist designs. All twelve college quadrangles are organized around a courtyard, and each has a dining hall, courtyard, library, common room, and a range of student facilities. The twelve colleges are named for important alumni or significant places in university history. In 2017, the university opened two new colleges near Science Hill.[192] Jonathan Edwards College courtyard Branford College courtyard Saybrook College's Killingworth Courtyard Hopper College courtyard Berkeley College buildings Trumbull College courtyard Davenport College courtyard Pierson College courtyard Silliman College courtyard Timothy Dwight College courtyard Morse College courtyard Ezra Stiles College courtyard Benjamin Franklin College courtyard Pauli Murray College courtyard Calhoun College[edit] Since the 1960s, John C. Calhoun's white supremacist beliefs and pro-slavery leadership[193][194][195][196] had prompted calls to rename the college or remove its tributes to Calhoun. The racially motivated church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina, led to renewed calls in the summer of 2015 for Calhoun College, one of 12 residential colleges, to be renamed. In July 2015 students signed a petition calling for the name change.[194] They argued in the petition that—while Calhoun was respected in the 19th century as an ""extraordinary American statesman""—he was ""one of the most prolific defenders of slavery and white supremacy"" in the history of the United States.[194][195] In August 2015 Yale President Peter Salovey addressed the Freshman Class of 2019 in which he responded to the racial tensions but explained why the college would not be renamed.[196] He described Calhoun as ""a notable political theorist, a vice president to two different U.S. presidents, a secretary of war and of state, and a congressman and senator representing South Carolina"".[196] He acknowledged that Calhoun also ""believed that the highest forms of civilization depend on involuntary servitude. Not only that, but he also believed that the races he thought to be inferior, black people in particular, ought to be subjected to it for the sake of their own best interests.""[193] Student activism about this issue increased in the fall of 2015, and included further protests sparked by controversy surrounding an administrator's comments on the potential positive and negative implications of students who wear Halloween costumes that are culturally sensitive.[197] Campus-wide discussions expanded to include critical discussion of the experiences of women of color on campus, and the realities of racism in undergraduate life.[198] The protests were sensationalized by the media and led to the labelling of some students as being members of Generation Snowflake.[199] In April 2016 Salovey announced that ""despite decades of vigorous alumni and student protests,"" Calhoun's name will remain on the Yale residential college[200] explaining that it is preferable for Yale students to live in Calhoun's ""shadow"" so they will be ""better prepared to rise to the challenges of the present and the future"". He claimed that if they removed Calhoun's name, it would ""obscure"" his ""legacy of slavery rather than addressing it"".[200] ""Yale is part of that history"" and ""We cannot erase American history, but we can confront it, teach it and learn from it."" One change that will be issued is the title of ""master"" for faculty members who serve as residential college leaders will be renamed to ""head of college"" due to its connotation of slavery.[201] Despite this apparently conclusive reasoning, Salovey announced that Calhoun College would be renamed for groundbreaking computer scientist Grace Murray Hopper in February 2017.[202] This renaming decision received a range of responses from Yale students and alumni.[203][204][205] Student organizations[edit] In 2014, Yale had 385 registered student organizations, plus an additional one hundred groups in the process of registration.[206] The university hosts a variety of student journals, magazines, and newspapers. Established in 1872, The Yale Record is the world's oldest humor magazine. Newspapers include the Yale Daily News, which was first published in 1878, and the weekly Yale Herald, which was first published in 1986. The Yale Journal of Medicine & Law is a biannual magazine that explores the intersection of law and medicine. Dwight Hall, an independent, non-profit community service organization, oversees more than 2,000 Yale undergraduates working on more than 70 community service initiatives in New Haven. The Yale College Council runs several agencies that oversee campus wide activities and student services. The Yale Dramatic Association and Bulldog Productions cater to the theater and film communities, respectively. In addition, the Yale Drama Coalition[207] serves to coordinate between and provide resources for the various Sudler Fund sponsored theater productions which run each weekend. WYBC Yale Radio[208] is the campus's radio station, owned and operated by students. While students used to broadcast on AM and FM frequencies, they now have an Internet-only stream. The Yale College Council (YCC) serves as the campus's undergraduate student government. All registered student organizations are regulated and funded by a subsidiary organization of the YCC, known as the Undergraduate Organizations Funding Committee (UOFC).[209] The Graduate and Professional Student Senate (GPSS) serves as Yale's graduate and professional student government. The Yale Political Union is advised by alumni political leaders such as John Kerry and George Pataki. The Yale International Relations Association (YIRA) functions as the umbrella organization for the top-ranked Model UN team. YIRA also has a Europe-based offshoot, Yale Model Government Europe, other Model UN conferences such as YMUN Korea or YMUN Taiwan, and educational programs such as the Yale Review of International Relations (YRIS), YMUN Institute, or Hemispheres. The campus includes several fraternities and sororities. The campus features at least 18 a cappella groups, the most famous of which is The Whiffenpoofs, which from its founding in 1909 until 2018 was made up solely of senior men. Yale's secret societies include Skull and Bones, Scroll and Key, Wolf's Head, Book and Snake, Elihu, Berzelius, St. Elmo, Manuscript, Shabtai, Myth and Sword, Mace and Chain and Sage and Chalice. The two oldest existing honor societies are the Aurelian (1910) and the Torch Honor Society (1916).[210] The Elizabethan Club, a social club, has a membership of undergraduates, graduates, faculty and staff with literary or artistic interests. Membership is by invitation. Members and their guests may enter the ""Lizzie's"" premises for conversation and tea. The club owns first editions of a Shakespeare Folio, several Shakespeare Quartos, and a first edition of Milton's Paradise Lost, among other important literary texts. Traditions[edit] See also: Bladderball Yale seniors at graduation smash clay pipes underfoot to symbolize passage from their ""bright college years,"" though in recent history the pipes have been replaced with ""bubble pipes"".[211][212] (""Bright College Years,"" the university's alma mater, was penned in 1881 by Henry Durand, Class of 1881, to the tune of Die Wacht am Rhein.) Yale's student tour guides tell visitors that students consider it good luck to rub the toe of the statue of Theodore Dwight Woolsey on Old Campus; however, actual students rarely do so.[213] In the second half of the 20th century Bladderball, a campus-wide game played with a large inflatable ball, became a popular tradition but was banned by administration due to safety concerns. In spite of administration opposition, students revived the game in 2009, 2011, and 2014.[214][215][216] Athletic[edit] Main article: Yale Bulldogs The Yale Bowl, the college football stadium located near Yale University Yale supports 35 varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference, the Eastern College Athletic Conference, the New England Intercollegiate Sailing Association. Yale athletic teams compete intercollegiately at the NCAA Division I level. Like other members of the Ivy League, Yale does not offer athletic scholarships. Yale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Yale Bowl (the nation's first natural ""bowl"" stadium, and prototype for such stadiums as the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and the Rose Bowl), located at The Walter Camp Field athletic complex, and the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, the second-largest indoor athletic complex in the world.[217] In May 2018, the men's lacrosse team defeated the Duke Blue Devils to claim their first ever NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship,[218] and are the first Ivy League school to win the title since the Princeton Tigers in 2001.[219] In 2016, the men's basketball team won the Ivy League Championship title for the first time in 54 years, earning a spot in the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. In the first round of the tournament, the Bulldogs beat the Baylor Bears 79–75 in the school's first-ever tournament win.[220] The Walter Camp Gate at the Yale Athletic Complex October 21, 2000, marked the dedication of Yale's fourth new boathouse in 157 years of collegiate rowing. The Gilder Boathouse is named to honor former Olympic rower Virginia Gilder '79 and her father Richard Gilder '54, who gave $4 million towards the $7.5 million project. Yale also maintains the Gales Ferry site where the heavyweight men's team trains for the Yale-Harvard Boat Race. Yale crew is the oldest collegiate athletic team in America, and won Olympic Games Gold Medal for men's eights in 1924 and 1956. The Yale Corinthian Yacht Club, founded in 1881, is the oldest collegiate sailing club in the world. In 1896, Yale and Johns Hopkins played the first known ice hockey game in the United States. Since 2006, the school's ice hockey clubs have played a commemorative game.[221] Yale students claim to have invented Frisbee, by tossing empty Frisbie Pie Company tins.[222][223] Yale athletics are supported by the Yale Precision Marching Band. ""Precision"" is used here ironically; the band is a scatter-style band that runs wildly between formations rather than actually marching.[224] The band attends every home football game and many away, as well as most hockey and basketball games throughout the winter. Yale intramural sports are also a significant aspect of student life. Students compete for their respective residential colleges, fostering a friendly rivalry. The year is divided into fall, winter, and spring seasons, each of which includes about ten different sports. About half the sports are coeducational. At the end of the year, the residential college with the most points (not all sports count equally) wins the Tyng Cup. Song[edit] Notable among the songs commonly played and sung at events such as commencement, convocation, alumni gatherings, and athletic games are the alma mater, ""Bright College Years"". Despite its popularity, ""Boola Boola"" is not the official fight song, albeit being the origin of the university's unofficial motto. The official Yale fight song, ""Bulldog"" was written by Cole Porter during his undergraduate days and is sung after touchdowns during a football game.[225] Additionally, two other songs, ""Down the Field"" by C.W. O'Conner, and ""Bingo Eli Yale"", also by Cole Porter, are still sung at football games. According to College Fight Songs: An Annotated Anthology published in 1998, ""Down the Field"" ranks as the fourth-greatest fight song of all time.[226] Mascot[edit] The school mascot is ""Handsome Dan,"" the Yale bulldog, and the Yale fight song contains the refrain, ""Bulldog, bulldog, bow wow wow"". The school color, since 1894, is Yale Blue.[227] Yale's Handsome Dan is believed to be the first college mascot in America, having been established in 1889.[228] Notable people[edit] Benefactors[edit] Yale has had many financial supporters, but some stand out by the magnitude or timeliness of their contributions. Among those who have made large donations commemorated at the university are: Elihu Yale; Jeremiah Dummer; the Harkness family (Edward, Anna, and William); the Beinecke family (Edwin, Frederick, and Walter); John William Sterling; Payne Whitney; Joseph Earl Sheffield, Paul Mellon, Charles B. G. Murphy, Joseph Tsai, and William K. Lanman. The Yale Class of 1954, led by Richard Gilder, donated $70 million in commemoration of their 50th reunion.[229] Charles B. Johnson, a 1954 graduate of Yale College, pledged a $250 million gift in 2013 to support the construction of two new residential colleges.[230] The colleges have been named respectively in honor of Pauli Murray and Benjamin Franklin. A $100 million contribution[231] by Stephen Adams enabled the Yale School of Music to become tuition-free and the Adams Center for Musical Arts to be built.

So-called “public Ivies” such as University of Michigan and Berkeley were not considered elite or even prestigious in the minds of evaluators (in contrast, these “state schools” were frequently described pejoratively as “safety schools” that were “just okay”). Even Ivy League designation was insufficient for inclusion in the super-elite. For undergraduate institutions, “top-tier” typically included only Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Stanford, and potentially Wharton (University of Pennsylvania’s Business School). By contrast, Brown, Cornell, Dartmouth, and University of Pennsylvania (general studies) were frequently described as “second tier” schools that were filled primarily with candidates who “didn’t get in” to a super-elite school.

It is Canada's third-largest university,[3] and it has approximately 55,700 students, 7,000 faculty and staff, and over 325,000 alumni worldwide.[3] It has eleven faculties, including the Faculty of Liberal Arts & Professional Studies, Faculty of Science, Lassonde School of Engineering, Schulich School of Business, Osgoode Hall Law School, Glendon College, Faculty of Education, Faculty of Health, Faculty of Environmental Studies, Faculty of Graduate Studies, the School of the Arts, Media, Performance and Design (formerly the Faculty of Fine Arts), and 28 research centres. York University was established in 1959 as a non-denominational institution by the York University Act,[4] which received Royal Assent in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario on 26 March of that year.[5] Its first class was held in September 1960 in Falconer Hall on the University of Toronto campus with a total of 76 students.[6] In the fall of 1961, York moved to its first campus, Glendon College, which was leased from U of T, and began to emphasize liberal arts and part-time adult education.[5] In 1965, the university opened a second campus, the Keele Campus, in North York, within the neighbourhood community now called York University Heights. Several of York's programs have gained notable recognition both nationally and internationally. York houses Canada's oldest film school,[7] which has been ranked one of the best in Canada,[8] with an acceptance rate comparable to that of USC School of Cinematic Arts and Tisch School of the Arts.[9] York's Osgoode Hall Law School was ranked fourth best in Canada, behind U of T, McGill, and UBC.[10] In The Economist's 2011 full-time MBA rankings, York's Schulich School of Business ranked ninth in the world, and first in Canada,[11] and in CNN Expansion's ranking of MBA programs, Schulich ranked 18th in the world, placing first in Canada.[12] York's School of Kinesiology and Health Science ranked fourth in Canada and 24th best in the world in 2018.[13] Over the last twenty years, York has become a centre for labour strife with several faculty and other strikes occurring,[14][15][16][17][2][18] including the longest university strike in Canadian history in 2018.

The president, appointed by the board, was to provide a link between the two bodies and to perform institutional leadership.[5] In the fall of 1961, York moved to its first campus, Glendon College, and began to emphasize liberal arts and part-time adult education.[5] York became independent in 1965, after an initial period of affiliation with the University of Toronto (U of T), under the York University Act, 1965.[19] Its main campus on the northern outskirts of Toronto opened in 1965.[6] Murray Ross, who continues to be honoured today at the university in several ways – including the Murray G. Ross Award – was still vice-president of U of T when he was approached to become York University's new president.[20] At the time, York University was envisaged as a feeder campus to U of T, until Ross's powerful vision led it to become a completely separate institution.[21] In 1965, the university opened a second campus, the Keele Campus, in North York, in the Jane and Finch community.[22] The Glendon campus became a bilingual liberal arts college led by Escott Reid, who envisaged it as a national institution to educate Canada's future leaders, a vision shared by Prime Minister Lester Pearson, who formally opened Glendon College in 1966.[22] The first Canadian undergraduate program in dance opened at York University in 1970.[20] In 1972, Canada Post featured the nascent institution on 8¢ stamps, entitled York University Campus, North York, Ont.[23] The first Canadian PhD program in women's studies opened with five candidates in January 1992.[20] Its bilingual mandate and focus on the liberal arts continue to shape Glendon's special status within York University.[24] The new Keele Campus was regarded as somewhat isolated, in a generally industrialized part of the city. Petrol storage facilities are still across the street. Some of the early architecture was unpopular with many, not only for the brutalist designs, but the vast expanses between buildings, which was not viewed as suitable for the climate. In the last two decades, the campus has been intensified with new buildings, including a dedicated student centre and new fine arts, computer science and business administration buildings, a small shopping mall, and a hockey arena. The Aviva Centre tennis stadium, built in 2004, is a perennial host of the Canada Masters tennis tournament. As Toronto has spread further out, York has found itself in a relatively central location within the built-up Greater Toronto Area (GTA), and in particular, near the Jane and Finch neighbourhood. Its master plan envisages a denser on-campus environment commensurate with that location. Students occupied the university's administration offices in March 1997, protesting escalating tuition hikes.[20] In June 2014, the university announced that a new campus would be constructed in Markham, Ontario.[25] The campus will be built near Highway 407, between Kennedy Road and Warden Avenue in partnership with Seneca College.[26] The new campus would house approximately 4,200 students[27] and is anticipated to accommodate up to 10,000 students in future phases.[28] On May 20, 2015, the provincial government announced it will provide financial contribution to this new project.[29] On October 24, 2018, the provincial government announced it would pull its funding for the campus, along with funding for the planned satellite campuses of Laurier University and Ryerson University.[30][31] After this cancellation of funding for the Markham project, York University and its partners planned to seek alternative funding.[32] In July 2020, the provincial government allowed plans for the university to go through.

All together, nearly 50,000 students attend classes on the Keele campus. Glendon Campus[edit] Main article: Glendon College Glendon College is a bilingual liberal arts faculty and separate campus of York University.[62] Glendon College is home to the Leslie Frost library.[63] Markham Centre Campus[edit] Main article: Markham Centre Campus In 2018, York University announced a proposal to construct a third campus in the city of Markham. The Government of Ontario supported to partially fund the construction and was announced by premier Doug Ford on July 23, 2020.[64] Other locations[edit] While most of the Schulich School of Business and Osgoode Hall Law School programs are offered at the Keele Campus, both of them maintain satellite facilities in downtown Toronto. Schulich operates the Miles S. Nadal Management Centre at 222 Bay Street (Ernst & Young Tower within the Toronto-Dominion Centre), while Osgoode Hall has a Professional Development Centre at One Dundas West Tower within the Toronto Eaton Centre. Faculty of Environmental Studies The Lillian Meighen Wright Centre is billed as an eco campus next to Las Nubes Forest Reserve in Costa Rica.[65] Student life[edit] Colleges and residences[edit] York has nine undergraduate residential colleges: Founders Residence Vanier Residence Winters Residence Colleges of York University Name(Founded) Motto/Mandate Academic Affiliations Namesake Calumet (1970) ""Technology and the Arts"" Business Administration, Economics, Business and Society, Cognitive Science, Communication Studies, Psychology Norman-French for pipe or pipestem.

Glendon College acts as both a faculty and a college of the university. New College was created in 2009 to accommodate the creation of the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies. Student unions and organizations[edit] York University is home to over 350 student clubs.[66] A number of larger student organizations are supported by student levy fees. These include the local chapters of the social justice group OPIRG, and Regenesis, an environmental organization on campus that runs farmers' markets at the Keele and Glendon campuses, a free store, a community bike centre and an borrowing centre. The Village at York University[edit] The Village at York University[67] off-campus student housing area has become a popular area of accommodation for many upper-year and post-graduate students, and the area has had a large amount of attention particularly for large parties hosted by students, including the annual Battle of the Village kegger held in March. There have also been many reports of the level of noise pollution from late-night parties from students living in the area.[68] Safety has also been a pressing issue.[69] Campus media[edit] Excalibur has been the university's autonomous student newspaper since 1966. In 2008, the YU Free Press was formed as an alternative campus newspaper.[70] YorkU Magazine (est. 2003) is the official magazine of York University. It is published 3 times a year in both a print and digital format. Athletics[edit] York University vs University of Guelph The university is represented in U Sports by the York Lions. Beginning in 1968 York's sporting teams were known as the ""Yeomen"", after the Yeomen Warders, the guardians of the fortress and palace at the Tower of London, otherwise known as Beefeaters. Later, the name ""Yeowomen"" was introduced to encourage women to participate in sports. Popular sentiment ran against this name scheme, however, as many students were fond of noting that a ""Yeowoman"" was fictitious, neither a real word nor having any historical merit. In 2003, after conducting an extensive internal study, the university replaced both names with the ""Lions"", as part of a larger renaming effort, and a new logo, now a white and red lion, was brought into line with the university's new visual scheme. The name change also brought York University in line with the 92% of other Canadian universities which use a single name for both sexes' sports teams. Ironically, students often refer to the female Lions teams as the ""York Lionesses"", even though the name ""Lion"" is intended to apply to both sexes.[71] York offers 29 interuniversity sport teams, 12 sport clubs, 35 intramural sport leagues, special events and 10 pick-up sport activities offered daily. York University has several athletic facilities, some of which are used for major tournaments. These include a football stadium, 4 gymnasia, 5 sport playing fields, 4 softball fields, 9 outdoor tennis courts, 5 squash courts, 3 dance/aerobic studios, 6 ice arenas, a swimming pool, an expanding fitness centre and the new Aviva Centre (home of the Rogers Tennis Cup). In 2014 the York Lions won four banners: the Canadian Interuniversity Sport (CIS) men's national track and field championship, the Ontario University Athletics women's provincial tennis championship and both the OUA and CIS men's soccer titles. York will be hosting the 2015 CIS Men's Soccer Championships at York Stadium November, 2015.[72] In 2015 and 2016 York Lions Women's Tennis team won the Canadian University National Championships.[73] Fight song[edit] Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as commencement and convocation, and athletic games are: ""York Song"", sung to the tune ""Harvard"".[74] Fraternities and sororities[edit] Fraternities and sororities are not recognized by York University.[75] Phi Delta Phi (ΦΔΦ) international legal fraternity, at Osgoode Law School, was given special dispensation when the law school became part of the university, as the fraternity's history with the law school dated back to 1896, and is recognized at York. Campus safety[edit] Many students at York University feel that York University does not do enough to notify students of security incidents on or near campus.[76] Incidents[edit] In June 2008, the university announced it had commissioned an external safety audit after a string of rapes on the university campus. During frosh week 2007, two men entered a campus dormitory and raped two students.[77][78] The victims were 17 and 18 years old at the time.[79] A lawsuit filed claims that ""the entrance door to the college and to the residential room areas of the college were virtually wide open to the public at large"".[80] The perpetrators were Daniel Katsnelson (aka Daniel Kaye or Daniel Katz) and Justin Connort.[81] The next year, in January 2008, another student was sexually assaulted in the stairwell of a campus building.[82] In May 2009, a contract security guard was shot at a York University campus pub, The Underground.[83] In April 2010, a 20-year-old student was sexually assaulted while walking to her apartment, minutes away from the main campus.[84] The incident, described by police as ""particularly severe"" and resulting in ""very serious"" injuries for the victim, was particularly notable as it occurred just a week after Daniel Katsnelson was sentenced for the 2007 rape on the university campus.[85][86] In April 2011, campus security was temporarily increased following the murder of a 23-year-old Chinese overseas student[87][88] in the off-campus housing neighborhood The Village at York University.[89][90][91] On August 26, 2011, York University announced that in response to recommendations in the METRAC Safety Audit, the university will be modifying the service delivery model for York Security Services (YSS) personnel. Members will be trained and issued with handcuffs and batons. Cruisers are to also be equipped with ""silent partners"" for transporting arrested persons.[92] On March 6, 2014, local police and paramedics responded late at night to a shooting at the York University Student Centre. Two women were found at the scene; one had been shot and suffered non-life-threatening injuries and another received minor (non-gun-related) injuries from the suspect. A suspect was apprehended and subsequently charged.[93] On April 10, 2014, two injured students and six others who witnessed the shooting filed a $20.5 million lawsuit against the university, alleging a pattern of negligence.[94] According to the York University community safety reports, security incidents have been on the rise.[95] Property crime has increased from 497 incidents in 2014/2015 to 670 in 2018/2019. Incidents affecting quality of life increased from 962 incidents in 2014/2015 to 1529 in 2018/2019. Crimes against persons increased from 145 in 2014/2015 to 187 in 2018/2019.

Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. Please do not remove this message until conditions to do so are met. (December 2020) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) York University has a history of faculty and teaching assistant strikes. In 1997, there was a faculty strike by YUFA[102] that lasted seven weeks. At the time, this was the second longest strike in Canadian University history.[103] Key issues in the strike included retirement, funding, and institutional governance. In 2001, teaching assistants and contract faculty went on strike for 11 weeks, when the university broke its own record.[104] The central issue in the 2001 disruption was the administration's proposed attempts to remove tuition indexation language. 2008 CUPE 3903 Strike Main article: 2008–09 York University strike A strike beginning on November 6, 2008[105] concerned a variety of institutional grievances, including job security for contract professors, elimination of the Non-Academic Student Code of Conduct, creation of whistleblower protection, and fund indexation. On January 20, 2009, CUPE 3903 defeated a forced ratification vote that would have ended the strike. On January 24, Ontario premier Dalton McGuinty announced a rare Sunday recall of the provincial legislature in order to pass back-to-work legislation mandating an immediate end to the strike.[106] On January 29, the York University Labour Disputes Resolution Act was passed in the provincial parliament on a count of 42–8 ending the long 85-day strike and setting a precedent for future university strikes in Ontario. 2015 CUPE 3903 Strike An additional strike by teaching assistants, contract faculty, and graduate assistants took place throughout March 2015. When the strike began, on March 2, the university cancelled nearly all classes because about 2/3 of York courses were taught by the striking contract faculty at the time. On March 10, the contract faculty ratified a new agreement, but the teaching assistants and graduate assistants rejected tentative agreements the bargaining team had reached with the university. The teaching assistants and graduate assistants, continued their strike until the end of the month. Contract faculty did not go back to work in support of the union and classes remained cancelled. The union reached a tentative agreement with the university on March 29, 2015, which was ratified on March 31, 2015, thus putting an immediate end to the 29-day strike.[107] 2018 CUPE 3903 Strike Main article: 2018 York University strike Units 1, 2, and 3 of CUPE Local 3903, the union represented by teaching assistants, contract faculty, and graduate assistants, began striking on Monday, March 5, 2018; several months after their previous collective agreement expired on August 31, 2017. The union's aim was to, in their words, ""secure a fair collective agreement that, among other things, protected quality education and creates a less precarious working environment in Ontario's university sector.""[108] The main issues of the strike revolved around job security and the path to permanent tenured employment for contract faculty. A forced ratification vote was held between April 6–9 and was rejected by an overwhelming majority by all three units. [109] On June 13, a ratification vote was held for Unit 2 members, where the union executives recommended voting against the university's offer.[110] The results of the vote were thrown out due to the fact that there were more ballots cast than signatures of eligible voters.[111] A re-vote was held on June 14 and 15, where Unit 2 ratified the university's offer, with 239 members voting in favour, and 122 opposed. Units 1 and 3 remained on strike until July 25, when the newly formed 42nd Parliament of Ontario led by Premier Doug Ford passed back-to-work legislation via the Urgent Priorities Act, ending the strike after 143 days, making it the longest strike in the post-secondary sector in Canadian history.

It is Canada's third-largest university,[3] and it has approximately 55,700 students, 7,000 faculty and staff, and over 325,000 alumni worldwide.[3] It has eleven faculties, including the Faculty of Liberal Arts & Professional Studies, Faculty of Science, Lassonde School of Engineering, Schulich School of Business, Osgoode Hall Law School, Glendon College, Faculty of Education, Faculty of Health, Faculty of Environmental Studies, Faculty of Graduate Studies, the School of the Arts, Media, Performance and Design (formerly the Faculty of Fine Arts), and 28 research centres. York University was established in 1959 as a non-denominational institution by the York University Act,[4] which received Royal Assent in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario on 26 March of that year.[5] Its first class was held in September 1960 in Falconer Hall on the University of Toronto campus with a total of 76 students.[6] In the fall of 1961, York moved to its first campus, Glendon College, which was leased from U of T, and began to emphasize liberal arts and part-time adult education.[5] In 1965, the university opened a second campus, the Keele Campus, in North York, within the neighbourhood community now called York University Heights. Several of York's programs have gained notable recognition both nationally and internationally. York houses Canada's oldest film school,[7] which has been ranked one of the best in Canada,[8] with an acceptance rate comparable to that of USC School of Cinematic Arts and Tisch School of the Arts.[9] York's Osgoode Hall Law School was ranked fourth best in Canada, behind U of T, McGill, and UBC.[10] In The Economist's 2011 full-time MBA rankings, York's Schulich School of Business ranked ninth in the world, and first in Canada,[11] and in CNN Expansion's ranking of MBA programs, Schulich ranked 18th in the world, placing first in Canada.[12] York's School of Kinesiology and Health Science ranked fourth in Canada and 24th best in the world in 2018.[13] Over the last twenty years, York has become a centre for labour strife with several faculty and other strikes occurring,[14][15][16][17][2][18] including the longest university strike in Canadian history in 2018.

The president, appointed by the board, was to provide a link between the two bodies and to perform institutional leadership.[5] In the fall of 1961, York moved to its first campus, Glendon College, and began to emphasize liberal arts and part-time adult education.[5] York became independent in 1965, after an initial period of affiliation with the University of Toronto (U of T), under the York University Act, 1965.[19] Its main campus on the northern outskirts of Toronto opened in 1965.[6] Murray Ross, who continues to be honoured today at the university in several ways – including the Murray G. Ross Award – was still vice-president of U of T when he was approached to become York University's new president.[20] At the time, York University was envisaged as a feeder campus to U of T, until Ross's powerful vision led it to become a completely separate institution.[21] In 1965, the university opened a second campus, the Keele Campus, in North York, in the Jane and Finch community.[22] The Glendon campus became a bilingual liberal arts college led by Escott Reid, who envisaged it as a national institution to educate Canada's future leaders, a vision shared by Prime Minister Lester Pearson, who formally opened Glendon College in 1966.[22] The first Canadian undergraduate program in dance opened at York University in 1970.[20] In 1972, Canada Post featured the nascent institution on 8¢ stamps, entitled York University Campus, North York, Ont.[23] The first Canadian PhD program in women's studies opened with five candidates in January 1992.[20] Its bilingual mandate and focus on the liberal arts continue to shape Glendon's special status within York University.[24] The new Keele Campus was regarded as somewhat isolated, in a generally industrialized part of the city. Petrol storage facilities are still across the street. Some of the early architecture was unpopular with many, not only for the brutalist designs, but the vast expanses between buildings, which was not viewed as suitable for the climate. In the last two decades, the campus has been intensified with new buildings, including a dedicated student centre and new fine arts, computer science and business administration buildings, a small shopping mall, and a hockey arena. The Aviva Centre tennis stadium, built in 2004, is a perennial host of the Canada Masters tennis tournament. As Toronto has spread further out, York has found itself in a relatively central location within the built-up Greater Toronto Area (GTA), and in particular, near the Jane and Finch neighbourhood. Its master plan envisages a denser on-campus environment commensurate with that location. Students occupied the university's administration offices in March 1997, protesting escalating tuition hikes.[20] In June 2014, the university announced that a new campus would be constructed in Markham, Ontario.[25] The campus will be built near Highway 407, between Kennedy Road and Warden Avenue in partnership with Seneca College.[26] The new campus would house approximately 4,200 students[27] and is anticipated to accommodate up to 10,000 students in future phases.[28] On May 20, 2015, the provincial government announced it will provide financial contribution to this new project.[29] On October 24, 2018, the provincial government announced it would pull its funding for the campus, along with funding for the planned satellite campuses of Laurier University and Ryerson University.[30][31] After this cancellation of funding for the Markham project, York University and its partners planned to seek alternative funding.[32] In July 2020, the provincial government allowed plans for the university to go through. Academics[edit] Reflecting pool in the Harry W. Arthurs Common York's approximately 2,450 full-time faculty and academic librarians are represented by the York University Faculty Association.[33] Contract faculty, teaching assistants, and graduate assistants are represented by CUPE Local 3903.[34] Admissions[edit] York University has over 120 undergraduate programs with 17 degree types (BA, iBA, BHS, BSc, iBSc, BBA, iBBA, BEng, BES, BDes, BPA, BFA, BCom, BEd, BDEM, BHRM, BScN, BSW) and offers over 170 degree options. They admit to 30 international degrees offering international language study and opportunities to study abroad at more than 100 international universities. Its international students represent over 150 countries around the world.

York ranked 14th Globally and fourth in Canada in the Times Higher Education Impact Rankings for Climate Action.[41][38] In the 2021 U.S. News & World Report Best Global University Ranking, the university ranked 432nd in the world, and 17th in Canada.[39] The Canadian-based Maclean's magazine ranked York University sixth in their 2021 Canadian comprehensive university category, tied with the University of New Brunswick.[40] The university's research performance has been noted in several bibliometric university rankings, which uses citation analysis to evaluates the impact a university has on academic publications. The 2019 Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities ranked the university 488th in the world, and 19th in Canada,[42] whereas the University Ranking by Academic Performance placed the university 488th in the world, and 19th in Canada.[43] York University has also been featured in rankings that evaluates the employment prospects of its graduates. In QS's 2020 graduate employability ranking, the university ranked 301–500 in the world, and 10–16 in Canada.[44] Faculties[edit] View of Vari Hall from Harry W. Arthurs Common York University's Film Department houses Canada's oldest film school[7] and has been ranked one of the best in Canada,[8] with an acceptance rate comparable to that of USC School of Cinematic Arts and Tisch School of the Arts.[9] York University is home to the oldest and largest environmental studies faculty in Canada.[45] From 1999 to 2018, York University offered the first and largest graphic design program in Ontario York/Sheridan Design (YSDN).[46] It was a four-year University degree delivered jointly by the two leading educational institutions of design in Canada (York University and Sheridan College). The joint program has been discontinued and beginning with the class entering in 2019, four-year design students will enrol in a new Bachelor of Design offered by York University, one which is geared for the future of the profession.[47] The Osgoode Hall Law School moved from a downtown location to the York campus in 1969, following the requirement that every law school affiliate with a university.[48] Osgoode Hall offers a number of joint and combined programs.[49] Research centres and institutes[edit] York researchers at the York University Research Leaders 2014 event.

York's Jazz Department was once overseen by Oscar Peterson. York also has a joint Bachelor of Design program with Sheridan College. York's Departments of Film, Theatre and Creative Writing (which is not affiliated with the Faculty of Fine Arts) offers programmes in film production/directing, acting, and writing respectively, producing many award-winning graduates. Seneca@York[edit] The Keele campus is host to a satellite facility of Seneca College,[55] and York University offers a number of joint programs with Seneca College: School of Communication Arts Computer Studies Biological Science and Applied Chemistry Corporate and Technical Communications Nursing Libraries[edit] Main article: York University Libraries The York University library has a number of branches.[56] The Scott Library has materials in humanities, social sciences, fine arts, and environmental studies.[57] The business library is the Peter F. Bronfman Business Library.[58] Study abroad programs[edit] The university also offers the opportunity for students to earn credits towards their degree while studying abroad through international internships, the ""Discover India"" program operated between York and FLAME University, and student exchange programs.[59] The university has student exchange agreements with over 120 institutions in 40 countries.[60] Campuses[edit] Keele Campus[edit] An outdoor art exhibit outside of Scott Library, Keele Campus Main article: Keele Campus (York University) The Keele Campus is the main campus of York University and is located in northern Toronto bordering York Region.[61] Most of the university's faculties reside here, including Liberal Arts, Fine Arts, Business, Law, Environmental Studies, Science and Engineering, Education, and Health. All together, nearly 50,000 students attend classes on the Keele campus. Glendon Campus[edit] Main article: Glendon College Glendon College is a bilingual liberal arts faculty and separate campus of York University.[62] Glendon College is home to the Leslie Frost library.[63] Markham Centre Campus[edit] Main article: Markham Centre Campus In 2018, York University announced a proposal to construct a third campus in the city of Markham. The Government of Ontario supported to partially fund the construction and was announced by premier Doug Ford on July 23, 2020.[64] Other locations[edit] While most of the Schulich School of Business and Osgoode Hall Law School programs are offered at the Keele Campus, both of them maintain satellite facilities in downtown Toronto. Schulich operates the Miles S. Nadal Management Centre at 222 Bay Street (Ernst & Young Tower within the Toronto-Dominion Centre), while Osgoode Hall has a Professional Development Centre at One Dundas West Tower within the Toronto Eaton Centre. Faculty of Environmental Studies The Lillian Meighen Wright Centre is billed as an eco campus next to Las Nubes Forest Reserve in Costa Rica.[65] Student life[edit] Colleges and residences[edit] York has nine undergraduate residential colleges: Founders Residence Vanier Residence Winters Residence Colleges of York University Name(Founded) Motto/Mandate Academic Affiliations Namesake Calumet (1970) ""Technology and the Arts"" Business Administration, Economics, Business and Society, Cognitive Science, Communication Studies, Psychology Norman-French for pipe or pipestem.

Glendon College acts as both a faculty and a college of the university. New College was created in 2009 to accommodate the creation of the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies. Student unions and organizations[edit] York University is home to over 350 student clubs.[66] A number of larger student organizations are supported by student levy fees. These include the local chapters of the social justice group OPIRG, and Regenesis, an environmental organization on campus that runs farmers' markets at the Keele and Glendon campuses, a free store, a community bike centre and an borrowing centre. The Village at York University[edit] The Village at York University[67] off-campus student housing area has become a popular area of accommodation for many upper-year and post-graduate students, and the area has had a large amount of attention particularly for large parties hosted by students, including the annual Battle of the Village kegger held in March. There have also been many reports of the level of noise pollution from late-night parties from students living in the area.[68] Safety has also been a pressing issue.[69] Campus media[edit] Excalibur has been the university's autonomous student newspaper since 1966. In 2008, the YU Free Press was formed as an alternative campus newspaper.[70] YorkU Magazine (est. 2003) is the official magazine of York University. It is published 3 times a year in both a print and digital format. Athletics[edit] York University vs University of Guelph The university is represented in U Sports by the York Lions. Beginning in 1968 York's sporting teams were known as the ""Yeomen"", after the Yeomen Warders, the guardians of the fortress and palace at the Tower of London, otherwise known as Beefeaters. Later, the name ""Yeowomen"" was introduced to encourage women to participate in sports. Popular sentiment ran against this name scheme, however, as many students were fond of noting that a ""Yeowoman"" was fictitious, neither a real word nor having any historical merit. In 2003, after conducting an extensive internal study, the university replaced both names with the ""Lions"", as part of a larger renaming effort, and a new logo, now a white and red lion, was brought into line with the university's new visual scheme. The name change also brought York University in line with the 92% of other Canadian universities which use a single name for both sexes' sports teams. Ironically, students often refer to the female Lions teams as the ""York Lionesses"", even though the name ""Lion"" is intended to apply to both sexes.[71] York offers 29 interuniversity sport teams, 12 sport clubs, 35 intramural sport leagues, special events and 10 pick-up sport activities offered daily. York University has several athletic facilities, some of which are used for major tournaments. These include a football stadium, 4 gymnasia, 5 sport playing fields, 4 softball fields, 9 outdoor tennis courts, 5 squash courts, 3 dance/aerobic studios, 6 ice arenas, a swimming pool, an expanding fitness centre and the new Aviva Centre (home of the Rogers Tennis Cup). In 2014 the York Lions won four banners: the Canadian Interuniversity Sport (CIS) men's national track and field championship, the Ontario University Athletics women's provincial tennis championship and both the OUA and CIS men's soccer titles. York will be hosting the 2015 CIS Men's Soccer Championships at York Stadium November, 2015.[72] In 2015 and 2016 York Lions Women's Tennis team won the Canadian University National Championships.[73] Fight song[edit] Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as commencement and convocation, and athletic games are: ""York Song"", sung to the tune ""Harvard"".[74] Fraternities and sororities[edit] Fraternities and sororities are not recognized by York University.[75] Phi Delta Phi (ΦΔΦ) international legal fraternity, at Osgoode Law School, was given special dispensation when the law school became part of the university, as the fraternity's history with the law school dated back to 1896, and is recognized at York. Campus safety[edit] Many students at York University feel that York University does not do enough to notify students of security incidents on or near campus.[76] Incidents[edit] In June 2008, the university announced it had commissioned an external safety audit after a string of rapes on the university campus. During frosh week 2007, two men entered a campus dormitory and raped two students.[77][78] The victims were 17 and 18 years old at the time.[79] A lawsuit filed claims that ""the entrance door to the college and to the residential room areas of the college were virtually wide open to the public at large"".[80] The perpetrators were Daniel Katsnelson (aka Daniel Kaye or Daniel Katz) and Justin Connort.[81] The next year, in January 2008, another student was sexually assaulted in the stairwell of a campus building.[82] In May 2009, a contract security guard was shot at a York University campus pub, The Underground.[83] In April 2010, a 20-year-old student was sexually assaulted while walking to her apartment, minutes away from the main campus.[84] The incident, described by police as ""particularly severe"" and resulting in ""very serious"" injuries for the victim, was particularly notable as it occurred just a week after Daniel Katsnelson was sentenced for the 2007 rape on the university campus.[85][86] In April 2011, campus security was temporarily increased following the murder of a 23-year-old Chinese overseas student[87][88] in the off-campus housing neighborhood The Village at York University.[89][90][91] On August 26, 2011, York University announced that in response to recommendations in the METRAC Safety Audit, the university will be modifying the service delivery model for York Security Services (YSS) personnel. Members will be trained and issued with handcuffs and batons. Cruisers are to also be equipped with ""silent partners"" for transporting arrested persons.[92] On March 6, 2014, local police and paramedics responded late at night to a shooting at the York University Student Centre. Two women were found at the scene; one had been shot and suffered non-life-threatening injuries and another received minor (non-gun-related) injuries from the suspect. A suspect was apprehended and subsequently charged.[93] On April 10, 2014, two injured students and six others who witnessed the shooting filed a $20.5 million lawsuit against the university, alleging a pattern of negligence.[94] According to the York University community safety reports, security incidents have been on the rise.[95] Property crime has increased from 497 incidents in 2014/2015 to 670 in 2018/2019. Incidents affecting quality of life increased from 962 incidents in 2014/2015 to 1529 in 2018/2019. Crimes against persons increased from 145 in 2014/2015 to 187 in 2018/2019.

Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. Please do not remove this message until conditions to do so are met. (December 2020) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) York University has a history of faculty and teaching assistant strikes. In 1997, there was a faculty strike by YUFA[102] that lasted seven weeks. At the time, this was the second longest strike in Canadian University history.[103] Key issues in the strike included retirement, funding, and institutional governance. In 2001, teaching assistants and contract faculty went on strike for 11 weeks, when the university broke its own record.[104] The central issue in the 2001 disruption was the administration's proposed attempts to remove tuition indexation language. 2008 CUPE 3903 Strike Main article: 2008–09 York University strike A strike beginning on November 6, 2008[105] concerned a variety of institutional grievances, including job security for contract professors, elimination of the Non-Academic Student Code of Conduct, creation of whistleblower protection, and fund indexation. On January 20, 2009, CUPE 3903 defeated a forced ratification vote that would have ended the strike. On January 24, Ontario premier Dalton McGuinty announced a rare Sunday recall of the provincial legislature in order to pass back-to-work legislation mandating an immediate end to the strike.[106] On January 29, the York University Labour Disputes Resolution Act was passed in the provincial parliament on a count of 42–8 ending the long 85-day strike and setting a precedent for future university strikes in Ontario. 2015 CUPE 3903 Strike An additional strike by teaching assistants, contract faculty, and graduate assistants took place throughout March 2015. When the strike began, on March 2, the university cancelled nearly all classes because about 2/3 of York courses were taught by the striking contract faculty at the time. On March 10, the contract faculty ratified a new agreement, but the teaching assistants and graduate assistants rejected tentative agreements the bargaining team had reached with the university. The teaching assistants and graduate assistants, continued their strike until the end of the month. Contract faculty did not go back to work in support of the union and classes remained cancelled. The union reached a tentative agreement with the university on March 29, 2015, which was ratified on March 31, 2015, thus putting an immediate end to the 29-day strike.[107] 2018 CUPE 3903 Strike Main article: 2018 York University strike Units 1, 2, and 3 of CUPE Local 3903, the union represented by teaching assistants, contract faculty, and graduate assistants, began striking on Monday, March 5, 2018; several months after their previous collective agreement expired on August 31, 2017. The union's aim was to, in their words, ""secure a fair collective agreement that, among other things, protected quality education and creates a less precarious working environment in Ontario's university sector.""[108] The main issues of the strike revolved around job security and the path to permanent tenured employment for contract faculty. A forced ratification vote was held between April 6–9 and was rejected by an overwhelming majority by all three units. [109] On June 13, a ratification vote was held for Unit 2 members, where the union executives recommended voting against the university's offer.[110] The results of the vote were thrown out due to the fact that there were more ballots cast than signatures of eligible voters.[111] A re-vote was held on June 14 and 15, where Unit 2 ratified the university's offer, with 239 members voting in favour, and 122 opposed. Units 1 and 3 remained on strike until July 25, when the newly formed 42nd Parliament of Ontario led by Premier Doug Ford passed back-to-work legislation via the Urgent Priorities Act, ending the strike after 143 days, making it the longest strike in the post-secondary sector in Canadian history.

94,"About Us NW Skip to content Home Events Network News About us Become a Member Menu Home Events Network News About us Become a Member About Us ABOUT YES-DC Young Energy Specialists and Development Co-operation (YES-DC) is an association of students and young professionals interested and/or working in the field of energy and development co-operation. YES-DC was found in October 1994, as a means to create a network and to facilitate the exchange of information and experiences. Since March 1996, YES-DC has officially been established as an association. YES-DC HISTORY On 15th October 1994, over twenty-five enthusiastic young professionals came together to discuss the future of energy. In the 1990’s, before the internet and social media, the need arose for a discussion platform to share knowledge and ideas. On 28th January 28 1995, a second meeting was organised, and Young Energy Specialists and Development Co-operation (YES-DC) was officially founded. Since the beginning, the focus has been on both the Dutch energy system, and energy systems in developing countries. In the mid 2000’s, as the general thought was that the Dutch energy system was ‘finished’, the focus was increasingly laid on how we could help developing countries in their future energy needs.However, as the impact of climate change was becoming more visible, the focus shifted back towards the Dutch energy system. How can we work towards a sustainable energy system, running on renewable energy sources? Many, many aspects of this complex issue have been discussed over the last years.Throughout its history, YES-DC has been organising sessions to deepen our understanding of the challenges we face, and the solutions that are out there. The focus has mostly been a technical one, although also more ‘soft aspects’ around implementation have been discussed over the last years. YES-DC still organises several sessions every year. YES-DC MISSION ENGAGING YOUNG PROFESSIONALS IN THE FIELD OF RENEWABLE AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY, AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT THROUGH KNOWLEDGE SHARING, NETWORKING AND COMMUNITY BUILDING. YES-DC MEMBERS The members of YES-DC are young professionals and students in the field of energy and/or sustainability. They work within local and international companies, government bodies, universities, research institutions, and NGOs. The board of YES-DC are honorary members, which besides their professional occupations takes care of the organisational and financial framework, and organises these knowledge-sharing and networking opportunities, considering the valuable input from its members along the way. The YES-DC Alumni are former board members, which gather once a year and are still part of the organization’s community. YES-DC Board Ligin Thomas President/Chairman “You think energy is a secondary problem. But think about it: almost all of today’s most basic problems like hunger and poverty are tied to energy. So you solve the problem of energy; you solve half of the world’s problems.”This particular quote from my professor Dr P.V Bhale during my bachelors was the spark to my desire to become energy professional. I have been acquainted with the complexity of solving the energy problem ever since I started my career in the oil and gas industry, several projects on offshore wind turbines and my latest work going on in the hydrogen transport infrastructure.My goal as a chairman/president of YES-DC is to work along with the board of 2021-2022 to strengthen our network, expand its reach and enable our members to reach their full potential in contributing to the energy transition. Linkedin Mrinal Abhinav Treasurer I believe that energy is the key contribution to financial development and there is a nearby connection between the accessibility of energy and the development of a country. YES-DC is the perfect platform to bridge that gap and share knowledge from different people on exciting topics. It would be a great opportunity for me to understand the prospect of the energy industry better and gain a well-rounded insight by networking with people. Linkedin Rene van der Velden Secretary To effectively and fairly shape the energy transition, young energy professionals need to keep learning from each other by sharing experiences and perspectives. I’m happy to be actively involved in stimulating the dialogue between the professionals currently tackling this challenge. With a background in international development, I see the differences and similarities of the energy transition in the global south and north. At YES-DC, I hope to link up these different perspectives so they will benefit from each other. I’m excited to organise effective events where people meet, grow their network, and learn.​ Linkedin Jier Nzuanzu Content Manager With the experience of studying and creating algorithms, I think I can do more than do my everyday job. Therefore, I choose to act actively, hoping that others in my field realise that we can do more. I am grateful to be a new board member, and I hope to learn and broaden my perspective about sustainability.In my term, I will focus my attention on the internal relations and the digital presence of YES-DC. With my help, I hope, together with the rest of the board, to create meaningful connections and engaging events.​ Linkedin Iva Tsvetkova Community Manager Being an active member in a few energy-related networks made me join YES-DC as a board member this year. After receiving so much in the form of valuable knowledge, connections and experience – it was my turn to give back to our community now. That’s why my focus is on growing and sustaining a diverse and collaborative community of energy professionals and students who aspire to follow their steps. Through my educational background, I gained knowledge on the energy transition from a business perspective. More particularly, on energy innovations and strategic solutions. I am looking forward to making our lectures/events known and accessible for a larger audience while cultivating the existing network in the upcoming year. These new uncertain times are calling for a change in how we do things and connect, so let’s build the platform’s future together! Linkedin Jose Carrasco Montejano External Relations While the technical knowledge required to face the climate crisis is readily available, we-as humanity- are failing to take bold actions to tackle the main challenge of our time. A shared problem requires shared efforts and a wide understanding of the problem we are facing. As the person within YES DC in charge of the relationship with external organizations, I will enable our members to access all the knowledge and networking options provided by our partner organizations on a global scale. ​ Linkedin Jan Jouke Melchers Events Manager Being a YES-DC member already brought me a lot of great contacts and insights into what the global energy transition is about. With joining the board I hope that the community can inspire even more young specialists to connect and seek the interfaces where each of our individual contributions to the energy puzzle overlap. I am convinced that the energy puzzle is only solved when we explore on an individual level but cooperate on a societal level. With the diversity of YES-DC and its related network/partners we have a major role in this and I am proud to be part of the team that can set the path forward for the upcoming year.​ Linkedin Young Energy Specialists and Development Co-operation (YES-DC) is an association of students and young professionals interested and/or working in the field of energy and international co-operation.

In this way on 20th May 1985 by active initiation of the socially conscious youth, a social development organization called YPSA (Young Power in Social Action) began its course of participation in the development process. Our Core Values ◯ Patriotism and commitment to national interest, sovereignty and national pride ◯ Justice, transparency and accountability  ◯ Mutual respect and gender friendliness ◯ Quality and excellence ◯ Humility and confidence ◯ Respect for diversity ◯ Support for environment and ecology Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) and YPSA’s Program NOTICE BOARD Office circular on ensuring Digital Security Act and use of Internet, YPSA Website and Social Media Read more Md.

Coverage – Manual /policies – YPSA divisions – Humen Resource – Major Awards and Recognition – The YPSA Logo Organizational Background The youth community makes up half of the world’s population. With a view to create worldwide awareness about this youth community and to ensure youth participation in development programs, the UN General Assembly on 3 rd November 1978, according to its resolution no. 33/7, declared the years 1981-90 as Youth Decade and 1985 as International Youth Year . Being inspired by spirit of International Youth Year some socially conscious youths of Sitakund Upazilla under Chittagong District of Bangladesh began to motivate and organize the youth community to establish a development organization. In this way on 20th May 1985 by active initiation of the socially conscious youth, a social development organization called YPSA (Young Power in Social Action) began its course of participation in the development process. Vision YPSA envisions a society without poverty where everyone’s basic needs and rights are ensured. Mission YPSA exists to participate with the poor and vulnerable population with all commitment to bring about their own and society’s sustainable development. Type of Organization YPSA is a voluntary, nongovernmental and nonprofit organization for sustainable development. Legal Status YPSA is registered with the different departments of the people’s republic of Bangladesh including NGO Affairs Bureau, Department of Social welfare, Department of Youth Development, Health and Family Welfare, Copyright office , Register of Joint Stock Companies and Firms and Micro Credit Regulatory Authority . Certificates Certificate of NGO Affairs Bureau Certificate of Copyright office, Ministry of Cultural Affairs Certificate of Department of Social welfare Certificate of Ministry of Health And Family Welfare Certificate of Micro Credit Regulatory Authority Certificate of Registrar of Joint Stock Companies & Firms Certificate of Department of Youth Development. Ministry of Youth & Sports Organizational Core Values YPSA will live and its members of staff, volunteer and governance will be abided by the following common sets of beliefs and standards: Patriotism and commitment to national interest, sovereignty and national pride: Patriotism and our national interests will be on top of all our concerns. In every sphere, national sovereignty and pride will be given priority over the interests on groups and individuals. We will also be respectful to and promote all the good elements of our culture. Justice, transparency and accountability : We believe, the rich, poor, indigenous people, small occupational class, people with disability and human beings of all ages cannot be discriminated against on any ground, and all are entitled to equal justice and rights. We will remain transparent and accountable to our primary stakeholders and others concerned for the effectiveness of our work, and will maintain openness in our judgments and communications. Mutual respect and gender friendliness : We recognize that each person is uniquely creative and we believe in human equality. We have mutual respect both for the people and for their environment. We believe that mutual respect leads to true participation, empowerment, motivation and commitment. YPSA’s organizational environment will be one of respect and gender equality where everyone will be considered as human beings not just men and women. Where necessary, we will discriminate in favor of women and girls to promote their rights. Quality and excellence : We will strive for highest possible standards in our conduct and performance. This will require continual renewal and regeneration of the organization and our work. We believe that we should seek continual innovation and not be afraid of failures. To achieve quality and excellence we must be transparent and accountable, timely, cost-effective, and work in appropriate and manageable ways. Humility and confidence : We will always be aware of our humility to the primary stakeholders of our work and other development players. We will be respectful and tolerant to the society, various views and creativity. To us every human being is special with some unique quality that deserves respect. Simultaneously, based on our experience, quality and commitment we will remain confident about taking sides with the poor and marginalized people. Respect for diversity : We believe diversity is one of the common major characteristics in every society that paves the way for creativity. We will be respectful to the diversities with an effort to create and promote unity. Support for environment and ecology : We believe for safe and healthy living good environment and ecology are indispensable. YPSA will actively take sides with all initiatives for the protection and betterment, and against any step towards degradation of the environment and ecology. Organizational Culture YPSA will maintain and promote some aspects of the organizational culture and try to include more elements to organizational culture to play a strong role in line with vision, mission and values. All members of staff, volunteer and governance of YPSA will be the key actors to achieve these. Some major aspects of our organizational culture include the following. Family friendliness : We will remain a family friendly organization for our members of staff, volunteers, governance, and program participants. Efforts will continue to extend help of one to the other to overcome any problem in one’s family and, at the same time, we will share the happy times of everyone in relevant cases. Being responsible and accountable : In all spheres – both inside and outside the organization – we will act responsibly and will remain accountable downwards (e.g. to the primary stakeholders), laterally (e.g. to our partners) and upwards (e.g. to our donors / funding agencies and the Government). We will help each other in the organization to be responsible and accountable. Cost-effectiveness and cost-efficiency : We will maintain our attention to cost-effectiveness in all expenditures particularly the ones for the organization so that we can spend the maximum amount of resources directly for the programs. In program implementation we always try to be cost-efficient to give maximum services to our primary stakeholders with minimum resources. These will also help us gradually reduce dependency on donors and create sustainable impact in the lives of the poor and marginalized. Constructive criticism and promotion of organizational profile : For all strategies, views and position of the organization and its members, YPSA will always encourage constructive criticism to get the best approach for its fight against poverty and marginalization. While being critical in the organization, all members will do their best to raise the profile of the organization in every activity and representation. Peaceful co-existence of different race, religion and class : Over time, we have been able to create an environment in the organization that ensures peaceful co-existence of different race, religion and class (including occupational class). Everyone’s view is respected and an objective judgment is given to all. YPSA has been able to promote this cultural aspect among many of its primary stakeholder groups as well. These elements of our culture will be maintained and promoted. Healthy recreation : Since inception YPSA has been trying to promote healthy recreation at different levels of the society. We will intensify our initiatives further to promote peaceful co-existence between different groups of people in the society, within the organization, and to focus on the various socio-economic issues affecting the lives of the people. This will also help us save the youth and adolescents stay away from the negative and destructive elements of life and society. Organizational Governance YPSA is governed by an Executive Committee consists of seven members and elected by general members according to its constitution. The Executive Committee formulates the strategic directions and principles of the organization and the Chief Executive conducts the overall management and representation of the organization. Organisational Structure As mentioned above, the organization has a 7-member Executive Committee, General Council, Advisory Council, full-time and part-time staff and Local – International Volunteers. The General Council, Executive Committee and Advisory Council members are from different professional background such as academician, business, development practitioners, journalism, researcher etc. The Member Secretary of the Executive Committee is the Chief Executive (CE) of the organization and conducts the overall management and representation of the organisation. All staff members are guided by a Human Resource Policy / Service rule with salary structure and benefits and some other organisational policies and guidelines. To promote voluntarism and community participation, the organisation introduced a system of voluntary work like Development Internship for the students, Program / Issue / Area based volunteer / Change Maker development with specific objectives and for a certain period. With in the Organizational Organogram , Under the Chief Executive there are four Directors – one for Field Operation / Social Development Division, one for Finance Division , One for Human Resource Management and Development Division and One for Micro Finance and Enterprise / Economic Development Division. Program Managers , Program Officers and Unit Chiefs are responsible for various programs or Projects implementation and report to the concerned Directors. Separate Internal Audit Team is responsible to ensure budgetary control and transparency through regular filed interventions and report to the Chief Executive. Organizational Identity YPSA’s aspired identity and roles are functions of its vision, mission and values as influenced by its understanding of poverty, vulnerability and marginalization and its root causes. YPSA identifies itself as an inter-dependent but truly a Bangladeshi social development organization that focuses mainly on the South and South Eastern parts of the country (with special importance on the Chittagong Division , Chittagong Hill Tracts -CHT and coastal areas). YPSA, with a total commitment to the eradication of poverty in Bangladesh, will be rooted in the appropriate values and culture of the people in the country. Based on its own strengths and those of the networks and relations, YPSA will position itself as an active part of the global process of eradicating poverty and marginalization. In line with its values, YPSA would like to be identified as a party-politically neutral organization . In other words, YPSA will not take sides of any political party or engage in promotion of any political party or their viewpoints. Neutrality in this context does not mean not engaging with ‘politics’, but it means engagement with relevant political processes over the issues identified by YPSA’s program participants as essential for eradication of poverty and establishment of people’s rights. It may be noted that, to YPSA, ‘politics’ refers to the processes and systems for distribution and control of resources. YPSA will strive to be a bold organization in its position and expression necessary for poverty eradication and establishment of rights. Linked to this is its desire to have its influence , active network and relationships all over Bangladesh and abroad. Organizational Role First and foremost, YPSA considers its role as a facilitator in the process of poverty eradication and establishment of rights. This role of facilitator recognizes that the primary actors and stakeholders in the process of poverty eradication are poor , marginalized and vulnerable men, women, boys, girls and their communities. The facilitation role involves both proactive and reactive process of intermediation to expand choices at the disposal of poorest , marginalized and vulnerable men, women, boys and girls. This also implies not taking over the process but ensuring that the process moves forward in the desired direction by the people for whom we work. A facilitator’s role does not mean that YPSA will not involve in direct implementation of development interventions. Where necessary, YPSA will play an active implementing role based on the actual needs but facilitation at different levels will remain a key to the process . Also, every direct implementation role will be aimed at enhancing the facilitator’s role in the future. YPSA will also play the role of an advocate to influence public policy, attitude and practices in favor of poor, marginalized and vulnerable men, women, boys and girls. Based on the legitimacy provided by our mandate and commitment for eradication of poverty and marginalization together with our continual contact, relationship and experience with poor , marginalized and vulnerable men, women, girls and boys, YPSA will be able to represent their interest and carry out advocacy in favor of them. This will be the role of amplifying the voices of poor , marginalized and vulnerable people, and the organization’s role and type / process of engagement will vary depending on different contexts and situation as well as needs.

The Michigan Environmental Health Tracking Program, MiTracking, can help bridge this gap. The MiTracking Program gathers existing Michigan-specific environmental and health data and provides them in one online location. These data can be easily queried on the MiTracking data portal. Results are provided in tables, charts, and maps that can be downloaded, saved, and printed. The data provided by the MiTracking program can create greater awareness of environmental health concerns, and inform public health actions and programs. The MiTracking Program is part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Tracking Network. For more information about states and cities in the CDC's Tracking Network, visit Michigan's Tracking Profile or other state profiles.

111,"Home | Zoï Environment Network Home About Topics Services Products Team Zoï Environment Network is a non-profit organization that helps build sustainable societies through informed analysis, visual communication, design and action. Our topics are Climate change Zoï staff has been working to combat climate change for over thirty years. Our early warning studies of the Nile Delta and the Uganda coffee crop – developed in the 1980ies – have set the standard in the international community for such research.  Since then, we have focused on demonstrating the impact of climate change all over the world and guide a range of different groups and entities towards climate neutrality. This also includes providing support towards the implementation of the historic Paris agreement on climate change. Biodiversity The preservation and management of the earth’s fragile ecosystems under ever-increasing pressure is central to the work of Zoï.  We support the Rio conventions on desertification and biodiversity with well-readable illustrated ‘heavy-weights’ such as ‘Desertification – a visual synthesis’, as well as simple ‘primers’ such as ‘Biodiversity in Central Asia’. Most recently, we have helped the Critical Ecosystems Partnership Fund to map key biodiversity hot spots in Central Asian mountains. Chemicals and Waste Chemicals can not only severely damage the environment but also endanger human health and lives. That’s why we highlight the need for urgent action in our visual products, such as the ‘Vital Waste Graphics’ series produced cooperatively with UN chemical conventions. We provide support to making international legal instruments on waste and chemicals and their priorities better understandable to non-specialists. Security and conflict Environmental challenges can cause security concerns both between and within countries. Addressing these risks has been one of central elements of Zoï’s work to-date. Through innovative analysis, participatory mapping and visualization, we have contributed to regionally and globally recognized flagship assessments on the environment-security interface. We are also highly engaged on the ground in addressing the unfolding environmental and social issues, including those concerning mining industry which is often at the source of local conflicts. Water In recent years, water use has become a focus in international affairs. Zoï has been part of many activities on the ground trying to understand, explain and improve the management of water concerns, in particular in internationally shared lake and rivers. We have also been working with a range of partners, in particular the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation and UNECE, to provide analytical and information support to a new type of ‘water diplomacy’. Access to information By its mission Zoï is dedicated to make environmental information as accessible as possible, and has cooperated over it with our traditional partner countries and such international organizations as UN Environment, the European Environment Agency and the UN Aarhus convention on access to environmental information. The result has been a wide range of innovative information products prepared by governments, researches, media and NGOs with our help.

Data availability, information technology and outreach possibilities have fundamentally changed over the past decades, allowing for more targeted policies and greater measurability of project results. Zoï realizes these benefits through scientifically and technically robust analyses that avoid overly complicated analytical frameworks. In places where information is absent or difficult to obtain due to complex political situations, we facilitate access and collect new data where required. Communication Zoï creates beautiful and clear communication products that succeed in engaging audiences across all levels of expertise in environmental and development thinking without compromising on technical or political complexity. Our combination of analytical expertise with creative talent yields custom-made maps, graphics, websites, brochures and videos that multiply reach and lifespan of the contained information. We are specialized in popularizing ‘heavy books’ like scientific studies, policy papers and evaluation reports. There our work is to extract key findings and messages and to replace insider jargon with easy, well-written text complemented with enlightening data visualization, illustrations, and high-quality photo- or videography. There is no fixed format for how we deliver these contents to our audience, and depending on individual project needs our tailored communication formats may range anywhere from workshop presentations to social media campaigns. Dialogue We operate in the background where the purpose of our communication is to support informed decision-making. Our permanent quest is to make complex environmental issues understandable for non-specialists, including politicians and a general public and thus provide a base for acting. Zoï has early on raised concerns about the environment and how it relates to national and regional security. As a result of this insight, we now help develop policies and road maps for decision-makers engaging them at all levels: from households to high office. Training Zoï trains decision-makers, local experts and media representatives to make best use of our products and enables them to help others. We insist on the application of international best practice and standards when researching, communicating and addressing environmental challenges. The areas of training include how countries and individuals can recognize environment and security risks, how experts can explain the environment to schoolchildren and ministers, and how enterprises can consult on topics such as climate neutrality.
