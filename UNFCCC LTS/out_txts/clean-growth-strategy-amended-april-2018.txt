131 BEIS initial estimates of a subset of new early stage policies and proposals show an additional potential reduction of up to 30 Mt and 80 Mt over the fourth and fifth 
carbon budget periods respectively; these and other policies will be developed building on the proposals outlined in the Strategy.
132 The Act sets out specific requirements to follow before deciding to use a particular flexibility (such as seeking advice from the Committee on Climate Change before 
banking) or when creating a framework for a decision to be taken within (such as setting a limit on the amount of carbon units which can be used to meet carbon 
budgets). Any use of flexibilities needs to be consistent with keeping the UK on track to meet its long term target in 2050 having regard to domestic action.
133 Government will take a decision on whether to bank any surplus from the second to third carbon budget by May 2019 and from the third to the fourth carbon budgets 
in May 2024. The decision will be made after taking into account advice from the Committee on Climate Change and consulting with the Devolved Administrations.42 Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy

actions outlined in the 2032 pathway in energy-consuming sectors (e.g. transport, homes, industry). Furthermore, a number of model updates and improvements have 
been made regarding the electricity demand profiles of key technologies and how this demand might be shifted, the availability of electricity storage technologies, and 
assumed system operability requirements.
342 The UK Net Carbon Account is defined by UK Carbon Accounting Regulations. Current regulations require that emissions covered by the EU Emissions Trading 
System (Traded emissions) are included as being equal to the UK’s allocation of permits under the System, rather than actual UK territorial emissions. When setting the 
fifth carbon budget, this allocation was estimated to be 590 MtCOe during the fifth carbon budget period.

Evidence base  
Commercial and public buildings: 2032 pathway analysis was based on the BEIS Non-domestic 
Building model using evidence from the Digest of UK Energy Statistics, Energy and Emissions 
Projections, ECUK and the Building Energy Efficiency Survey (BEES) to estimate heating, cooling 
and ventilation demand to 2032. Technology evidence was taken from BEES; RHI statistics 
and an interim heat pump performance report; an AECOM report on heat network costs and 
performance; and cost data from Heat Networks Delivery Unit (HNDU) sponsored projects. The 
Products Policy model was used for ventilation scenarios. For the 2050 pathways additional 
assumptions were taken from Carbon Trust; Valuations Office Agency and Poyry.
Industry: The 2032 pathway was developed using BEIS Industry Pathways Models, split into 
eight industry sectors. A capital cost uplift of 10 per cent has been applied in the 2032 analysis 
to reflect potential hidden costs of delivering measures. For iron and steel, paper, cement and 
a part of chemicals actual production steps are modelled, using evidence from the Usable 
Energy Database353. The remaining sectors (other chemicals, non-metallic minerals, non-ferrous 
metals, food and drink and ‘other’ industry) are split into the different energy service demand 
categories (e.g. high temperature heat, low temperature heat) and generic technologies that 
produce these types of energy are modelled. Assumptions for these sectors are mainly based 
on UK MARKAL. Evidence from the Government’s 2050 Industrial Decarbonisation and Energy 
Efficiency Roadmaps, published in 2015, was incorporated into the modelling; in particular, the 
timing and extent of technologies deployed in the 2032 pathway analysis.
Transport: The 2032 pathway was developed using the Department of Transport’s National 
Transport Model (NTM)354 for road measures and the Rail Emissions Model for rail measures. 
The NTM forecasts emissions and traffic accounting for impacts on vehicle fuel efficiency and 
fuel mix. The ECCo model was used to develop uptake scenarios for Ultra Low Emissions 
Vehicles. Impacts of sustainable travel measures were based on evidence from the evaluation 
of the Sustainable Travel Towns355. The NTM covers Great Britain, so an uplift has been applied 
to account for transport emissions from Northern Ireland. This is the standard approach taken 
by DfT. For 2050 pathways analysis, nine vehicle groups are represented (e.g. car, bus, lorry), 
each with different types of vehicle choice (e.g. electric or hydrogen). Car and LGV assumptions 
were based on Element Energy’s ECCo Cost and Performance Database; HGV assumptions 
from a Ricardo report to the CCC (A review of the efficiency and cost assumptions for road 
transport vehicles to 2050); and maximum growth and delivery rate assumptions from DfT/
University College London (UCL).

the-effects-of-smarter-choice-programmes-in-the-sustainable-travel-towns-full-report160 Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy
Domestic buildings: The 2032 pathway for existing buildings covers energy efficiency, heating 
technologies, heat networks, and behaviour change. The pathway was developed through the 
BEIS Domestic Buildings Scenario Model. Cost and performance assumptions for energy efficiency 
and heat measures is based on published analysis for the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) and 
Energy Company Obligation. For new homes, build rate assumptions were taken from the 2015 
Housing Standards Review Impact Assessment, and impacts of low carbon heat measures was 
based on analysis conducted by an AECOM-led consortium. Additional assumptions for the 
2050 pathways analysis are taken from UCL, Office of National Statistics (ONS) and Energy 
Consumption in the UK (ECUK). 
Power: The power sector’s response to the changes in demand under the 2032 pathway has been 
modelled using BEIS’s Dynamic Dispatch Model356. The DDM is a comprehensive fully-integrated 
power market model covering the market in Great Britain over the medium to long-term. The model 
enables analysis of electricity dispatch from GB power generators and investment decisions in 
generating capacity from 2010 through to 2050. It considers electricity demand and supply on a 
half-hourly basis for sample days. Investment decisions are based on projected revenue and cash 
flows taking into account policy impacts and changes in the generation mix. The full lifecycle of 
power generated plant is modelled, from planning through to decommissioning. The modelling 
accounts for risk and uncertainty involved in investment decisions. UK TIMES 2050 modelling 
uses the same technology assumptions as the DDM where possible, and also includes additional 
evidence from UCL, National Grid, EPRI and Carbon Trust.
Agriculture and land use: Agriculture: Evidence has been scaled from England to cover all of 
the UK Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland 
(1990-2015). The scaling factor is based on a five-year average of the national contributions to 
overall agricultural emissions from the national inventory report (the 2014 common reporting 
format tables). From that data the average English contribution to agricultural GHGs is 63 per 
cent and estimates are scaled up on this basis.
Forestry: Emissions reductions are projected using an off-line version of the CARBINE carbon 
accounting model with policy specific mixes of woodland types. Biomass supply from relevant 
harvest  fractions  are  included  in  the  scenario  analysis,  but  carbon  storage  and  emissions 
reductions associated with the use of harvested wood products are not. This evidence has been 
scaled from England to cover all of the UK, based on both the share of current and historical 
activity357 and afforestation scenarios developed with DA forestry leads through the LULUCF 
GHG inventory and projections project funded by the BEIS Science team. 
Soils: The 2032 pathway analysis for England uses analysis of the potential GHG savings from 
different types of peatland restoration. Emission reductions are estimated using preliminary 
findings from an forthcoming BEIS-funded research project combined with cost data from the 
peatland code, agri-environment payments and reports for the CCC Adaptation sub-Committee. 
In order to cover the UK as a whole the England-only data has been scaled based on estimates 
of total UK peatland area. Agriculture and land use is represented in the 2050 pathway analysis 
by applying a fixed emissions profile with a series of mitigation options available. This profile 
combines components from land use, crops and livestock.

357 Forestry Commission (2017) Forestry Statistics https://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/infd-7aqdgcThe Clean Growth Strategy 161
Waste: The emission saving from waste in the 2032 pathway has been informed by a variety 
of sources. Food waste prevention savings are based on WRAP analysis associated with the 
Courtauld Commitment 2025. Landfill diversion was based on Defra’s Routemap. Projections 
of waste arising are a key input to the model. Landfill gas capture and oxidation assumptions 
were developed in an expert elicitation exercise with the Environment Agency. Cover the UK 
as a whole, the England only data has been scaled based on the Greenhouse Gas Emissions 
Inventory for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland (1990-2015).
Economic growth and demographic changes: The 2032 pathway analysis used the same 
growth assumptions as the 2016 Energy and Emissions projections. In the UK TIMES model 
used for 2050 pathway analysis, there are 60-plus growth drivers which are exogenous to the 
model and based on a variety of assumptions including: BEIS Energy Demand Model outputs, 
GDP growth assumption, ONS population growth, Department for Communities and Local 
Government (DCLG) household projections and Department for Transport (DfT) transport driver 
estimates.
Fossil fuel prices: Fossil fuel prices assumptions are based on the BEIS Fossil Fuel Price 
Assumptions 2016358.
Carbon  Values:  The  Government’s  current  approach  to  carbon  valuation  was  adopted  in 
2009 based on a “target-consistent” methodology. This is set out here https://www.gov.uk/
government/collections/carbon-valuation--2. 
Aviation and Shipping (A&S): The CCC planning assumption is used to set the aviation and 
shipping “headroom” level in 2050. Domestic aviation and shipping is modelled as part of carbon 
budgets leading up to 2050. 
Bioresource: Bioresource availability is based on the Bioenergy Feedstock Availability Model359. 
The assumed land area available for energy crops has been limited by excluding a wide range of 
sensitive sites on both landscape and biodiversity grounds. Domestic and imported bioresource 
costs are from a range of sources including CCC, E4tech, Carbon Trust and Nix Farm Management.
Air quality: Air quality emissions factors are provided by the National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory 
and Aether. Air quality damage costs are consistent with COMEAP guidance on air pollution.
Hydrogen: Hydrogen assumptions were developed by University College London360. The costs 
are based on the assumption that a new network would need to be built to allow heating to be 
supplied by hydrogen. 
EU ETS: Assumptions for the UK’s share of EU ETS allowances are aligned with the levels 
assumed at the time of setting the respective budgets. These are 1,078 MtCO e (second carbon 
2
budget); 985 MtCO e (third); 690 MtCO e (fourth); and 590 MtCO e (fifth).
