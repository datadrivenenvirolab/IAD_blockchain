The Technology Investment Roadmap is expected to guide at least $20 billion of Australian Government 
investment in low emissions technologies over the decade to 2030. The forthcoming LETS 2021 will examine 
deployment pathways for these priority technologies to ensure we meet our ambitious economic stretch goals.
A whole-of-economy Plan to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 153.  Enabling deployment at scale
Achieving net zero emissions by 2050 will require the deployment at scale 
of low emissions technologies across the economy. Lived experience shows 
there is an exponential relationship between falling technology costs and 
deployment. Despite significant research and deployment efforts since the 
early 1970s, it took until 2002 to deploy the first gigawatt (GW) of solar 
globally. Over the following decade (2002-12), 100 GW were deployed. By the 
end of 2022, more than 1,000 GW of solar will have been deployed globally.
Today, more than 90% of solar cells globally use Australian technology. 
We aim to replicate this success with our next generation of low emissions 
technologies.
Australia is working not only to reduce technology costs, but also to 
remove barriers that may slow deployment across each economic sector. 
The Government is playing an enabling role to unlock investment and scale 
up technology deployment. This includes cross-cutting measures that 
apply across all sectors, and measures focused on overcoming barriers to 
technology deployment in individual sectors.
These measures include:
  planning for and building strategic and enabling infrastructure needed 
to unlock deployment, like electricity transmission and electric vehicle 
(EV) charging
  providing consumers and markets with the transparent information they 
need to de-risk technologies and make informed decisions, including 
developing a Hydrogen Guarantee of Origin certification scheme
  maintaining the high integrity accounting systems and trading 
infrastructure needed to grow Australia’s voluntary carbon markets 
  incentives and finance through the Emissions Reduction Fund, a new 
below-baseline Safeguard Crediting Mechanism and the CEFC that will 
accelerate technology adoption by firms. 
Together, our efforts to reduce technology costs and enable deployment 
at scale drives emissions reduction across our economic sectors and puts 
Australia on a trajectory to net zero emissions by 2050 (Figure ES.3).

supply. Australia’s coal and gas export industries will continue through to 2050 and 
beyond, supporting jobs and regional communities.
By building new industries like clean hydrogen, our Plan will create new export markets 
and jobs. These will benefit our regions, economy and jobs, and help other countries 
reduce their emissions faster. Analysis for the Plan shows that hydrogen, renewable 
energy and minerals like lithium could create more than 100,000 new direct jobs by 2050, 
many in Australia’s regions. An Australian hydrogen industry could be worth more than 
$50 billion in 2050. Expanding production and processing of metals like lithium, nickel, 
copper and uranium could together be worth around $85 billion in exports in 2050.
Australia will build on our comparative advantages to grow new and existing export 
industries for:
  critical minerals and metals used in clean technologies
  clean hydrogen
  low emissions fuels like LNG and uranium
  low emissions manufacturing (such as steel)
  innovative clean technologies
  agriculture. 
Australia is making critical investments to build these regional industries right around 
the country (Figure ES.5). We are investing over $1.2 billion in Australia’s hydrogen 
industry, including $464 million in 7 clean hydrogen industrial hubs. This will help 
grow a new hydrogen export industry and create local manufacturing jobs associated 
with low carbon products like ammonia, fertilizer, steel and aluminium. We are also 
investing over $300 million for carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS) technologies, 
projects and hubs. 
ARENA and the CEFC will continue to support projects and employment in regional

CEFC finance have been directed to regional areas.

Australia’s Plan will be flexible and adaptive. We will maintain 
a five yearly ‘review and refine’ cycle for the Plan, aligned with 
Australia’s Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the 
Paris Agreement. This will allow Australia to evolve our policies as 
technology and market developments occur and prospective net

allow us to work with our regions over time to capture opportunities 
from new industries and to manage the impacts of global demand

Australia will monitor and evaluate our progress towards net zero 
emissions, and will continue to be a leader in transparency and 
accountability. We will encourage the wide adoption of our world-
leading approach to emissions measurement and reporting and we 
will continue to share our technical expertise in these areas to boost 
the capabilities of countries in our region.

Key points
  Practical global action on climate change is in Australia’s national interest. This is why we have signed up 
to the Paris Agreement and are meeting and beating our ambitious emissions reduction targets. 
  Achieving the Paris Agreement’s global goals, including limiting warming to well below 2°C and reaching 
global net zero, will require practical action from all countries. Australia will play its part in the global effort 
to reach net zero emissions by 2050. 
  Our Plan is to reduce the cost of low emissions technologies, accelerate their deployment at scale, and 
position our economy to take advantage of new and traditional markets. Modelling shows that, with this 
technology-led plan, Australia will prosper as we decarbonise. Our Plan will not cost Australian jobs. 
  Australia is well placed to capture new employment and economic opportunities as the world shifts to 
low emissions technologies. Our Plan will support existing industries and workers to realise these benefits. 
Australian businesses are already taking practical action to reduce their emissions and emerging as global 
leaders in low emissions technology. 
  Low emissions technologies are essential to achieving global decarbonisation and development goals. 
Australia’s Plan focuses not only on reducing emissions domestically, but also on how we will play a global 
leadership role through our low emissions energy exports and contributions to innovation. 
  Most major sectors will grow strongly to 2050, even as the world decarbonises, but some sectors will face 
global headwinds. By building new industries like clean hydrogen, Australia will create new export markets 
and jobs. This will help offset long-term impacts in sectors like thermal coal and natural gas which will be 
affected by falling global demand and the shifting choices of international consumers.
  These shifts will unfold over decades, and these sectors (including coal and gas) will continue to provide 
jobs and underpin regional communities for many years to come.

A whole-of-economy Plan to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 271.3  Australia’s Plan and the global context
Keeping the increase in global temperatures below 2°C requires global CO₂ 
emissions to fall by over 75% between 2017 and 2050, and reach net zero 
globally by around 2070. Meeting a 1.5°C goal requires global net zero CO₂ 
emissions by 2050. Substantial reductions are also needed for other greenhouse 
gases like methane.9  
The global energy system will need to continue to evolve to meet these goals. 
Over a 30-year period, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has estimated 
that to achieve these goals:
  Low emissions technologies - including solar, hydropower and nuclear - 
must grow from 39% of global power generation to 100% between 2020 
and 2050.  
  Hydrogen and CCUS technologies will need to grow to contribute around 
50% of the emissions reductions in heavy industry.10 
The global community is mobilising, but the task is significant and we must turn 
around the trends of recent decades. Despite the ambitions and efforts of many 
nations, global emissions have increased by an average of 1.8% every year since 
1990 (Figure 1.3).11  More than 60% of the CO₂ budget consistent with keeping 
temperature rise below 2°C was exhausted between the pre-industrial period 
(1850 to 1900) and the end of 2019.12  Unless we can achieve deep reductions 
in global emissions, the remaining budget will be depleted. This would see the 
Paris temperature goals of well below 2°C exceeded by mid-century, and the 
1.5°C threshold could be reached much earlier.13 
Deep emissions reductions will require practical action by all major emitters – 
both developed and developing nations.
Achieving the global Paris goals needs to occur alongside an increasing world 
population and many nations’ development aspirations. The energy sector 
accounts for around 75% of global emissions today.14 By 2050, it must be 
cleaner and more efficient while meeting the needs of an estimated 2 billion 
extra people and a global economy more than twice its current size.South East 
Asia’s electricity demand growth has been among the fastest in the world and is 
projected to continue growing into the future.

Australia’s experience has highlighted the different policies and levers that can be 
applied to reduce emissions. Australia introduced a carbon tax in 2011, but repealed it 
100% in 2014. The Government considers that carbon taxes are regressive, with significant 
costs borne by people with least capacity to pay. Carbon taxes also apply to every

1.5.1  Economic implications at the national level and policy choices
Australia’s Plan has been informed by detailed modelling and analysis. This analysis has built 
on the work undertaken for the 2020 Low Emissions Technology Statement (LETS) to assess 
customer and technology trends and identify priority technologies for Australia, as well as 
subsequent work for the forthcoming LETS 2021 to understand how far and how soon the 
costs of those technologies could fall. Two complementary analytical approaches – top-down 
economic modelling and bottom-up analysis by McKinsey – were then used to understand the 
potential economic impacts that could follow. This approach has helped us evaluate how close 
we can get to net zero emissions through an agenda that reduces technology costs and shapes 
and expands the choices available to consumers.
The analysis shows that it is possible for Australia to get to net zero emissions by 2050 and 
that the costs will be significantly lower if we adopt a technology-based approach to reducing 
emissions. In a scenario where we succeed in driving down technology costs and accelerating 
their deployment at scale across all sectors, Australia can get within range of net zero by 2050 
with a voluntary incentive of less than $25 per tonne CO₂-e in 2050.21 This is comparable to costs 
observed in voluntary markets today.
Our modelling finds that, with our technology-led plan, Australia can continue to prosper even 
as we reduce our own emissions to net zero and global demand shifts towards low emissions 
technologies, fuels and commodities. The modelling projects that Australia’s economy will 
continue to grow and Australians will enjoy sustained growth in material living standards, 
with our Plan expected to increase our national income per person by almost $2000 in 2050, 
compared with no policy action. Employment remains strong, and our regional industries keep 
exporting energy to the world.
A technology not taxes approach is a must have. In contrast, if we fail to unlock new 
technologies then net zero by 2050 is only achievable for Australia at much higher marginal 
costs (about $100 to $170 per tonne CO₂-e) and with heavy reliance on carbon offsets from 
Australia’s productive agricultural land or from overseas. 
34 AUSTRALIA’S LONG TERM EMISSIONS REDUCTION PLANThe analysis shows that policy choices are important and directly 
impact the future wellbeing and prosperity of Australians. This is 
why the Government has adopted a balanced approach to deliver 
a pathway to net zero by 2050 that does not rely on:
  high carbon prices
  conversion of productive farming land to carbon sequestration
  excessive use of international units.
It is a balanced approach that will ensure Australia plays its role 
in the global effort to reach net zero by 2050 without threatening 
our prosperity or our regions.

particularly in regional areas. Growth in the mining and heavy industry sectors alone 
could create as many as 62,000 new jobs by 2050, mostly in regional areas.  Technology enables emissions intensity to fall across all sectors, meaning that 
emissions fall even as sectors grow and increase their output.
Australia’s adoption and integration of new technologies will create further benefits 
for the nation. McKinsey analysis suggests that technology could enable economy-
wide energy productivity improvements over the next 30 years, with energy 
consumption per dollar of GDP falling by half in per capita terms by 2050. This is 
substantially driven by the projected substitution of oil by electricity in transport as 
the share of electric vehicles EVs grows. This would also increase Australia’s energy 
self-sufficiency and help reduce the cost of Australia’s energy as a share of GDP from 
8% to 2%. 
A whole-of-economy Plan to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 37The modelling shows that, with our technology-led approach, Australia 
can reduce its emissions by two-thirds, to 215 Mt CO₂-e by 2050, before 
offsets. This outcome can be achieved at marginal costs comparable to those 
observed in voluntary markets today (below $25 per tonne CO₂-e). 
The scenario analysed by McKinsey also underscores the importance of 
technology. In a scenario with strong global momentum towards the Paris 
goals, McKinsey has assessed that falling technology costs and a voluntary 
incentive of $25 per tonne CO₂-e could enable Australia’s emissions to fall 
to 164 Mt CO₂-e in 2050, before offsets. By increasing the deployment of 
priority and other emerging technologies, deep emissions reductions can be 
achieved across all sectors, particularly in electricity (97% reduction on 2005 
levels in 2050), transport (71%) and buildings (near 100%). As discussed 
further in Chapter 2, the priority technologies contribute around 40% of the 
abatement needed to achieve net zero in 2050.
Offsets will play a crucial role in closing the gap towards net zero. Our 
modelling shows that modest contributions from land sector sequestration 
and targeted purchases of international offsets allow Australia to reduce its 
net emissions to 94 Mt CO₂-e in 2050, around 85% below 2005 levels. In the 
scenario analysed by McKinsey, including land sector sequestration allows 
Australia to reduce its net emissions to 111 Mt CO₂-e in 2050, 82% below 
2005 levels. 23   
There are a range of ways that Australia can close the remaining gap to net 
zero emissions by 2050. Future technology developments and markets are 
inherently uncertain, and it is possible that technology costs will fall faster 
than anticipated for some technologies, and new and disruptive technologies 
may emerge. 
38 AUSTRALIA’S LONG TERM EMISSIONS REDUCTION PLANThis has been the lived experience with technologies like solar and batteries, 
where cost reductions have consistently exceeded forecasts. Other analyses 
have highlighted that, for some important technologies, there is potential 
for higher abatement than has been assumed in the Plan. For example, the 
LETS 2020 noted the potential for improved management of one quarter of 
Australia’s crop and grazing lands to secure as much as 35–90 million tonnes 
per annum through soil carbon, at least twice the level of accredited land 
sequestration used in the analysis for the Plan.
Our analysis for the Plan is also relatively conservative about how quickly 
emissions in the transport sector will fall. 
Our technology-led approach is iterative and adaptive, meaning we can close 
this remaining gap over time by prioritising ongoing technology breakthroughs 
and other sources of abatement.
In summary, our analysis shows that net zero emissions by 2050 is achievable 
for Australia. Realising this outcome will depend on our success in reducing 
the costs of low emissions technologies and accelerating their deployment at 
scale across all sectors. Chapters 2 and 3 of this plan detail the practical actions 
Australia is taking to achieve this. Reducing our domestic emissions will also 
be aided by deeper international supply chains for low emissions technologies 
and fuels, which Australia is supporting by building our new and traditional 
export industries (Chapter 4) and by helping to foster global collaboration on 
technology and climate change (Chapter 5).
Targeted voluntary purchases of international offsets, domestic land sector 
sequestration and prioritising new technology breakthroughs, including 
negative emissions technologies, are all credible options for closing the gap 
to net zero, but each has costs and benefits. The exact balance between these 
options is a choice Australia can make over the coming decades. Chapter 6 
outlines the adaptive and flexible approach Australia will take on this issue.

Key points
  Australia has identified and prioritised low emissions technologies that will open net zero pathways for 
our economic sectors. 
  The Government is working with business, researchers and other nations to reduce the cost of these 
technologies so they become the rational choice for business and consumers.
  The technologies prioritised through Australia’s Technology Investment Roadmap can contribute and 
enable around half the emissions reductions needed to achieve net zero. They are:
–  clean hydrogen 
–  ultra low-cost solar
–  energy storage 
–  low emissions steel and aluminium
–  carbon capture and storage
–  soil carbon.
  The roadmap is expected to guide at least $20 billion of Australian Government investment in low 
emissions technologies over the decade to 2030. National agencies including ARENA, the CEFC and 
the Clean Energy Regulator, as well as other targeted programs and initiatives, have been aligned with 
the roadmap and are investing in priority technologies. They also support the development of other 
high-potential emerging technologies like livestock feed technologies to reduce methane emissions. 
  Australia is partnering and co-investing with other nations to foster a globally collaborative approach 
to low emissions technologies.

Australian CCUS projects could also play an important long-term 
role in negative emissions projects that store CO₂ drawn down 
from the atmosphere. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change (IPCC) has said negative emissions will be crucial in global 
efforts to meet the Paris Agreement’s temperature goals.34

This chapter outlines the policies and investments the Government is 
implementing to address the challenges that could slow technology 
deployment in each sector. 
In addition to these sector-based measures, Australia has introduced 
cross-cutting initiatives enabling voluntary emissions reductions 
across all sectors. For example, the CEFC is financing low emissions 
technologies across the economy, and ACCUs can be created for a 
wide spectrum of activities under the ERF. Climate Active – Australia’s 
globally recognised carbon neutral certification scheme – provides 
transparency to consumers and motivates firms to become leaders in 
emissions reduction and technology (Box 3.1).

64 AUSTRALIA’S LONG TERM EMISSIONS REDUCTION PLANHowever, the pace and scale of renewables deployment is also creating 
technical challenges for our electricity systems. If the integration of variable 
technologies is poorly managed, it could slow future deployment and make 
Australia’s electricity supply less secure, reliable, and affordable. The key 
challenge for the sector will be to ensure the share of renewables can grow 
while maintaining system services and ensuring consumers can access 
affordable electricity when they need it.
Existing technologies can help manage these issues.43  Batteries are already 
providing short-term firming and system services. Longer term firming 
technologies, alongside an expanded transmission grid, can provide seasonal 
storage and protection against weather variability. These could include 
pumped hydro, biomass, or new thermal generators combined with CCS.
Further in the future, other emerging technologies like new battery 
technologies, electric vehicle-to-grid and hydrogen will also help enable 
ongoing renewables deployment. There may also be the potential 
for Australia’s domestic demand to be reliably met by very large, 
export-oriented electricity systems that produce 200% or more of Australia’s 
needs 44 , or for modern third and fourth generation nuclear technologies to 
be deployed in Australia.
Addressing these barriers
The Australian Government is making major strategic infrastructure 
investments to enable ongoing renewables deployment. This includes 
our $1.38 billion investment in Snowy 2.0, which will add 2000 MW of 
dispatchable generation to the National Electricity Market. 
Investments in transmission, interconnector and storage projects such as 
the MarinusLink interconnector, Project EnergyConnect interconnector and 
Tasmania’s Battery of the Nation will provide vital support to the grid and 
connect new firm capacity. The Australian Government has supported or 
underwritten investment in more than $2.6 billion of new transmission. These 
projects will also create jobs, keep energy prices low and reduce emissions.
The Government is also making strategic investments in new dispatchable 
generation, including through the Underwriting New Generation Investment 
Program and its investment through Snowy Hydro Limited to construct a 
660 MW open cycle gas turbine in NSW. The Government has committed 
$24.9 million in funding to support new gas generators to be hydrogen-ready.

Governments, on the advice of the ESB, have adopted reforms such as Renewable

electricity grids. Victoria, NSW and Queensland are also developing state-based 
frameworks to stimulate investment in Renewable Energy Zones.
The transformation of Australia’s electricity system is making the planning, 
investment and operation of the grid more complex. The Australian Energy Market 
Operator (AEMO) is world-leading in responding to these changing needs, and 
has responded by developing Integrated System Plans (Box 3.2) and an enhanced 
digital operating system. The forthcoming LETS 2021 will recognise that ‘digital 
grid’ technologies will be fundamental to a low emissions economy, and ARENA has 
contributed $2.23 million to support AEMO’s work in this area.

Australia’s whole-of-economy long term emissions reduction plan 794.1  Opportunities for Australia and its 
regions from the global transformation
Regional industries have helped Australia’s economy to specialise in the 
production of emissions-intensive exports and become the world’s fourth 
largest energy exporter. Australia has built some of the world’s largest and most 
significant energy and resources supply chains into strong, fast-growing export 
markets across the Indo-Pacific region.
Australia is a global top three (or higher) exporter across a range of 
commodities, and is uniquely blessed with natural resources across:
  Traditional energy sources (e.g. coal and LNG),
  Emerging low emissions fuels (e.g. clean LNG, blue hydrogen and CCS), and
  The new energy economy (e.g. world-leading solar resource, available land, 
productive agriculture, critical minerals, green hydrogen potential).
Modelling from international bodies such as the IEA and IPCC illustrate the 
scale of change required to achieve the global goals of the Paris Agreement. To 
achieve the 2°C goal, global emissions must fall by over 75% between 2017 and 
2050 and reach global net zero by around 2070.79 Global electricity emissions 
will need to fall by more than 70%, even as electricity generation increases.80 
More rapid change will be needed to achieve a 1.5°C goal. Under all scenarios, 
low emissions technologies like solar, wind and nuclear power will need to 
contribute an increasing share of global electricity production. 
Despite the scale of this transformation, multiple studies (including modelling 
undertaken for this Plan)81 show the global economy will continue to grow and 
incomes continue to rise. The world’s demand for energy, minerals, agricultural 
products, and manufactured products like steel, are all projected to grow 
strongly to 2050 as the global population grows and living standards improve.
80 AUSTRALIA’S LONG TERM EMISSIONS REDUCTION PLANWith our natural endowments, experienced regional industries and skilled 
workforce, Australia is uniquely placed to benefit as this global shift unfolds.  
We can prosper in a world in transition and capitalise on the global shift to a 
new energy economy: 
  We have world-leading reserves of the minerals and base metals, such as 
lithium, nickel and copper, needed to produce batteries, renewables and 
electric vehicles. 
  We are one of the world’s biggest producers and exporters of liquefied 
natural gas (LNG), a critical transition fuel, and have built some of the 
world’s largest and most significant energy and resources supply chains into 
fast-growing export markets across the Indo-Pacific region.
  Our unmatched renewable energy resources and high quality CO₂ storage 
reservoirs can be the foundation for hydrogen production and low 
emissions manufacturing.
  Australian researchers and entrepreneurs are at the leading edge of low 
emissions technology innovation and have driven the development of 
globally significant technologies like solar photovoltaics (PV).
Modelling undertaken for this Plan shows that most of Australia’s export sectors 
across manufacturing, mining and agriculture stand to benefit from this shift. 
The value of Australia’s exports is projected to more than triple from 2020 
and 2050. Building on the modelling, McKinsey estimates that net regional 
employment in mining and heavy industry alone could grow by 62,000 by 2050.
The long-term prospects for Australia’s coal and gas sectors will depend on the 
preferences of our customers and the pace of international action. Australian 
natural gas production is expected to remain robust, and will be higher in 2030 
than it is today. Coal production will remain flat or decline slightly, by around 
6% over the same period. There will be ongoing demand for both commodities, 
especially in emerging markets in the Asia-Pacific and Indo Pacific. Given 
our proximity to these markets, our strong reputation as a supplier of energy 
exports and the high quality of our fossil fuel commodities, Australia is well-
placed to meet this demand.

Key points
  Australia is partnering and co-investing with trading and strategic partners to foster a globally 
collaborative approach to low emissions technologies. We are establishing new bilateral partnerships and 
playing a leading role in multilateral initiatives and institutions. 
  Our aim is to accelerate the technology transformations needed to decarbonise the world’s economy, 
not just our own. Scaling up global production and supply chains will lower the costs of deploying the 
technologies all countries – including Australia – need.
  Australia is also working with other countries, especially in our region, to access and adopt new 
technologies and build resilience to climate impacts. 
  Australia is working with our neighbours to establish a high-integrity carbon offset scheme in the 
Indo-Pacific. This will boost our region’s ability to attract private sector investment in low emissions 
technologies and provide access to an established market for offset credits.
A whole-of-economy Plan to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 915.1  Building international partnerships
Australia is working closely with the international community on low emissions 
technology innovation to reduce emissions and create jobs. These partnerships 
are:
  building strategic relationships with partners that share our ambitions
  sharing knowledge across global supply chains
  accelerating the development and deployment of low emissions technologies.
The Government has appointed Dr Alan Finkel, Australia’s former Chief Scientist, 
as Special Adviser to the Australian Government on Low Emissions Technologies. 
Dr Finkel is:
  supporting and expanding technology collaboration by brokering 
partnerships with Australia’s priority trade and strategic partners
  intensifying international engagement to drive investment in shared research 
and development, including Australian-based projects.
The Government has allocated $565.8 million to support international 
partnerships that help accelerate development of low emissions technologies and 
advance and support the goals of Australia’s Technology Investment Roadmap. 
The Government aims to attract at least $3 of funding from partners and other 
private sources for every $1 it invests. The Government has already announced 
partnerships with Germany, Japan, Singapore and the United Kingdom 
(Figure 5.1). 
Each of these partnerships will further Australia’s technology-led approach 
to reducing emissions by strengthening global cooperation on low emissions 
technology development and deployment. They will underpin the development 
of new technologies leading to emissions reductions, job creation, lower energy 
costs, new trade opportunities and greater investment in Australia.

Key points
  Australia’s Plan will be flexible and adaptive so we can refine and evolve our policies as technology and 
market developments occur, and as prospective pathways for different sectors and applications become 
clearer.
  The Australian Government will maintain a five yearly ‘review and refine’ cycle for the Plan in alignment 
with the delivery of Australia’s successive National Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement.  
This will ensure Australia’s policies are calibrated to reflect the latest technology advances, international 
developments and other factors relevant to our national circumstances.
  Australia will not reach net zero emissions by 2050 at the expense of our regions. The Government will 
conduct five yearly assessments of the impact of Commonwealth and state emissions reduction actions 
on regions and communities. These reviews will report against a range of key economic indicators such as 
energy prices, employment (particularly regional employment), export volumes and trends, investment 
trends and growth in national income.

Encouraging development of quality offsets through this scheme provides an 
additional option for Australia to bridge the gap to net zero emissions by 2050. It will 
also create a revenue stream for our neighbours and offer important environmental, 
adaptation and livelihoods benefits.
The benefit to the climate of an avoided tonne of emissions is the same wherever 
it occurs. By helping our neighbours deploy new low emissions technologies, 
Australia can help the Indo-Pacific region position itself to be competitive in a low 
emissions future.
6.2.3 Achieving further technology advances 
Additional direct emissions reductions could be enabled through a more aggressive 
approach to technology. Informed by the Technology Investment Roadmap and annual 
LETS, Australia could focus on bringing down the costs of currently very expensive 
abatement opportunities in hard-to-abate sectors like industry and agriculture. 
Australia could also capitalise on high potential technologies, like bioenergy with CCS 
or direct air capture with CCS, if global developments see those technologies emerge 
faster than anticipated.

MEASURES, INSTITUTIONS AND MAJOR INVESTMENTS
TABLE A.1:  KEY INSTITUTIONS
Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) ARENA provides grant funding to early-stage low emissions technologies to accelerate the pace of 
pre-commercial innovation. It has funded over $1.8 billion of early-stage research and development projects since 
2012, with a focus on solar, wind and other renewable energy technologies, as well as enabling technologies such 
as energy storage and grid integration. ARENA has been provided with an additional $1.62 billion of funding for 
the period up to the 2031–32 financial year. 
As well as the ongoing Advancing Renewables Program and Innovation Program, ARENA also administers 
targeted funding programs including the Regional Australia Microgrids Pilot Program and the Industrial Energy 
Transformation Studies Program. ARENA’s mandate was recently expanded to cover low emissions technologies 
in all sectors, including agriculture and transport.
Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) The CEFC supports the commercialisation of renewable energy, energy efficiency and low emissions technology 
projects through loans and equity investments. By providing financial support, CEFC helps de-risk technologies 
across electricity generation, energy storage, industry and agriculture. It has also played an important role in 
developing an Australian sustainable finance sector.
The $10 billion CEFC is the world’s largest government-owned ‘green bank’. Since 2013, it has invested more than 
$9.5 billion in clean energy projects worth more than $32.8 billion. 
The CEFC administers several targeted funds, including:
  Clean Energy Innovation Fund
  Advancing Hydrogen Fund
  Australian Recycling Investment Fund
  Sustainable Cities Fund
  Reef Fund.
The Government has introduced legislation to establish a new $1 billion Grid Reliability Fund, also to be 
administered by the CEFC.
106 AUSTRALIA’S LONG TERM EMISSIONS REDUCTION PLANTABLE A.1:  KEY INSTITUTIONS
Clean Energy Regulator (CER) The CER administers the Emissions Reduction Fund (ERF), which supports the creation, verification and purchase 
of Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCUs). The Government allocated $2.55 billion to the ERF in 2014–15, and 
in 2018–19 allocated a further $2 billion through the Climate Solutions Fund to build on the ERF’s success and 
support additional low-cost abatement. To date, the CER has committed around $2.5 billion through the ERF 
towards emissions reduction projects across:
  agriculture and the land sector (particularly revegetation projects)
  landfill and waste
  energy efficiency
  industry
  transport.
The CER also administers the following:
  Australia’s National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (NGER) scheme. This is a single national framework for 
reporting and disseminating company information about greenhouse gas emissions, energy production, energy 
consumption and other information specified under the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007. 
  the Large-scale Renewable Energy Target (RET) and Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme (SRES). The 
Large-scale RET encourages investment in renewable power stations while the SRES supports small-scale 
installations like household solar panels and solar hot water systems. 
  the Australian National Registry of Emissions Units, which is a secure electronic registry system that tracks the 
location and ownership of units issued under the Kyoto Protocol and the Emissions Reduction Fund.
  the Safeguard Mechanism, which places mandatory emissions limits on around 200 of Australia’s largest 
emitters.
The CER is also leading work to build the systems and registries needed to underpin Australia’s voluntary carbon 
markets. This includes establishing an exchange trading platform for ACCUs and enhancing the registry for ACCUs 
to make it easier to trace the origin of units.

economy. This includes renewable and low emissions energy technologies and breakthrough technologies in agriculture 
(such as the Future Feed livestock feed supplement).
Climate Active Climate Active is Australia’s globally recognised carbon neutral certification initiative. Climate Active certifies 
businesses that reach net zero emissions by measuring, reducing and offsetting emissions against a best-practice carbon 
accounting standard. Certification is available for buildings, events, organisations, precincts, products and services. It 
provides transparency to consumers and motivates firms to become leaders in emissions reduction and technology. 
Climate Active’s membership has more than doubled in the last 12 months, with over 370 certifications across more than 
240 Australian businesses
Safeguard Mechanism The Safeguard Mechanism provides a framework for Australia’s largest emitters to measure, report and manage their 
emissions. It places emissions limits, called baselines, on large emitters, giving covered businesses a legislated obligation 
to keep net emissions below their baseline.
A whole-of-economy Plan to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 117TABLE A.4:  OTHER CROSS-CUTTING MEASURES AND INSTITUTIONS
Indo-Pacific regional crediting scheme The Australian Government will invest $59.9 million to establish a high-integrity carbon offset scheme in our 
Indo-Pacific region.
The scheme will boost partner countries’ abilities to attract private sector investment in emissions reduction projects in 
the renewables and nature-based solutions sectors. It will help these countries adopt new low emissions technologies 
and provide access to an established market for offset credits. This commitment will:
  boost public and private investment in climate action and practical projects in the region
  deliver real social, economic and environmental benefits for local communities
  generate a scalable supply of high-quality offsets that help Australian companies meet emissions reduction targets.
Climate Change Authority The Climate Change Authority plays an important role in the governance of Australia's mitigation policies, undertaking 
reviews and making recommendations on the Australian Government’s climate change policies. Reviews are also 
undertaken on other matters as requested by the Minister responsible for climate change or the Australian Parliament. 
The authority also conducts and commissions its own independent research and analysis.
