Page 4 Preface 
In the United States and around the world, we are already feeling the impacts of a changing cli-
mate. Here at home, in 2021 alone we have seen historic droughts and wildfires in the 
West, unprecedented storms and flooding in the Southeast, and record heatwaves across the 
country. We see the same devastating evidence around the world in places like the fire-ravaged 
Amazon, the sweltering urban center of Delhi, and the shrinking coastlines of island nations 
like Tuvalu. The science is clear: we are headed toward climate disaster unless we achieve net-
zero global emissions by midcentury. We also know this crisis presents vast opportunities 
to build a better economy, create millions of good-paying jobs, clean our waters and 
air, and ensure all Americans can live healthier, safer, stronger lives.   
The time is now for decisive action, and the United States is boldly tackling the climate chal-
lenge. In 2021, we rejoined the Paris Agreement, set an ambitious Nationally Determined Con-
tribution to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by 50-52% in 2030, launched the Global 
Methane Pledge, and have undertaken additional concrete actions to advance climate action 
domestically and internationally. These investments are critical to immediately accelerate our 
emissions reductions.  
This 2021 Long-Term Strategy represents the next step: it lays out how the United 
States can reach its ultimate goal of net-zero emissions no later than 2050. Achieving net-zero 
emissions is how we—and our fellow nations around the globe—will keep a 1.5°C limit on 
global temperature rise within reach and prevent unacceptable climate change impacts and 
risks.   
The Long-Term Strategy shows that reaching net-zero no later than 2050 will require actions 
spanning every sector of the economy. There are many potential pathways to get there, and all 
pathways start with delivering on our 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution. This will put 
the United States firmly on track to reach net-zero by 2050 and support the overarching vision 
of building a more sustainable, resilient, and equitable economy.   
The benefits of a net-zero future will not only be felt by future generations. Mobilizing to 
achieve net-zero will also deliver strong net benefits for all Americans starting today. Driving 
down greenhouse gases will create high-quality jobs, improve public health in every commu-
nity, and spur investments that modernize the American economy while reducing costs and 
risks from climate change. Reducing air pollution through clean energy will alone help 
avoid 300,000 premature deaths in the United States—alleviating these and other severe im-
pacts that also fall disproportionately on communities of color and low-income 
Page 5 communities. Investments in emerging clean industries will enhance our competitiveness and 
propel sustained economic growth.  
 
Modernizing the American economy to achieve net-zero can fundamentally improve the way 
we live, creating more connected, more accessible, and healthier communities. That does not 
mean it will happen quickly or without hard work. There will be many challenges on our path to 
net-zero that will require us to marshal all our ingenuity and dedication. But it can, and must, 
be done.  And even as we invest at home, the new technologies and investments outlined in 
this strategy will also help scale up low-cost, carbon-free solutions for the world.  
 
We can create a healthy, vibrant, and abundant world for our children. This plan is our promise 
to them—and it is one we must keep.

 Executive Summary 
Addressing the climate crisis requires immediate and sustained investment to eliminate net 
global greenhouse gas emissions by mid-century—and this presents a transformational oppor-
tunity for the United States and the world. Investing in the clean technologies, infrastructure, 
workforce, and systems of the future creates an unprecedented opportunity to improve quality 
of life and create vibrant, sustainable, resilient, and equitable economies.  
As we undertake this global transformation, the United States and other major economies must 
act quickly to keep a safer climate within reach. Across the United States and around the world, 
climate change is already harming communities—particularly the most vulnerable that are least 
equipped to cope, rebuild, and adapt. Wildfires, storms, floods, extreme heat, and other cli-
mate-fueled impacts are causing deaths, injuries, degraded health, economic hardship, and 
damage to the earth’s ecosystems—all from warming of only roughly 1.0°C. Failure to immedi-
ately curtail emissions will condemn the world to nearly triple that level of warming, unleashing 
far more frequent and severe climate impacts and far more extreme downside risks. 
The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) vividly il-
lustrates, with robust scientific confidence, the need to limit warming to 1.5°C, or as close as 
possible to that crucial benchmark, to avoid these severe climate impacts. Achieving this target 
will require cutting global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by at least 40% below 1990 levels by 
2030, reaching global net-zero GHG emissions by 2050 or soon after, and moving to net nega-
tive emissions thereafter [1]. To meet these global milestones, we must retool the global en-
ergy economy, transform agricultural systems, halt and reverse deforestation, and decisively 
address non-carbon dioxide emissions—focusing particular attention on methane (CH ), which 
4
accounts roughly 0.5oC of the current observed net warming of 1.0oC.1 We must also pursue 
negative emissions through robust and verifiable nature-based and technological carbon diox-
ide removal. 
In light of this urgency, the United States has set a goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions 
by no later than 2050.  
This U.S. net-zero 2050 goal is ambitious. It puts the United States ahead of the trajectory re-
quired to keep 1.5°C within reach through three decades of investment in clean power, electri-
fication of transportation and buildings, industrial transformation, reductions in methane and 
1 Greenhouse gas emissions in total have contributed 150% of the observed warming of 1.0⁰C, but emissions of 
cooling aerosols have counteracted some of that warming. 
Page 7 other potent non-carbon dioxide climate pollutants, and bolstering of our natural and working 
lands. 
Delivering on our 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) will put the United States 
firmly on track to net-zero. The United States has committed to an ambitious and achievable 
goal to reduce net GHG emissions 50-52% below 2005 levels in 2030.2 This is the decisive dec-
ade to deliver on a set of new policies [2] to accelerate existing emissions reduction trends—for 
example, expanding rapidly the deployment of new technologies like electric vehicles and heat 
pumps, and building the infrastructure for key systems like our national power grid. These types 
of near-term actions will put us on firm footing to meet our 2050 goal (as illustrated by Figure 
ES-1 below).  
Figure ES-1: United States historic emissions and projected emissions under the 2050 
goal for net-zero. This figure shows the historical trajectory of U.S. net GHG emissions 
from 1990 to 2019, the projected pathway to the 2030 NDC of 50-52% below 2005 lev-
els, and the 2050 net-zero goal. The United States has also set a goal for 100% clean 
electricity in 2035; that goal is not an economy-wide emissions goal so does not appear 
in this figure, but it will be critical to support decarbonization in the electricity sector, 
which will in turn help the U.S. reach its 2030 and 2050 goals in combination with broad 
electrification of end uses. For the period 1900-2020, real US emissions increased 
through 2007, then declined through 2020, reaching 17% below 2005 levels in 2020 
(approx. 5.5 gigatons CO2e). For the period 2020-2025, projected US emissions fall to 
26-28% below 2005 levels in 2025 (approx. 5 gigatons CO2e). For the period 2025-2030,

2021. 
Page 8 projected US emissions fall more sharply, reaching 50-52% below 2005 levels in 2030 
(approx. 3 gigatons CO2e). For the period 2030-2050, projected US emissions fall slightly 
less sharply, reaching -100% from 2005 levels in 2050 (0 gigatons CO2e). 
This report presents the 2021 Long-Term Strategy (LTS) of the United States. It illustrates mul-
tiple pathways to a net-zero economy no later than 2050  [3]  [4]  [5]. It confirms how actions 
taken now and through this decade are critical to make these net-zero pathways possible. The 
report draws from a diverse analytical toolkit,3 including a global integrated assessment model 
covering all GHGs and economic sectors, a national carbon dioxide (CO ) model with high en-
2
ergy sector resolution, models of the U.S. land sector, and a rich set of non-governmental litera-
ture. Pursuant to Article 4.19 of the Paris Agreement, this report also serves to communicate 
our Long-Term Strategy to the international community.  
Mobilizing to achieve net-zero will deliver strong net benefits for all Americans. Driving down 
GHGs will spur investments that modernize the American economy, address the distributional 
inequities of environmental pollution and climate vulnerability, improve public health in every 
community, and reduce the severe costs and risks from climate change. Benefits include: 
• Public health. Reducing air pollution through clean energy will avoid 85,000–300,000
premature deaths, and health and climate damages of $150–$250 billion through 2030.
It will avoid $1–3 trillion in damages through 2050 in the United States alone. These
measures will also help alleviate the pollution burdens disproportionately borne by
communities of color, low-income communities, and indigenous communities.
• Economic growth. Investments in nascent clean industries will enhance competitiveness
and propel sustained growth. The United States can lead in crucial clean technologies
like batteries, electric vehicles, and heat pumps, without sacrificing critical worker pro-
tections.
• Reduced conflict. Drought, floods, and other disasters fueled by climate change have
caused large-scale displacements and conflict. The U.S. Department of Defense recog-
nizes climate change as a vital, globally destabilizing national security threat  [6]. Early
action by the United States will encourage faster climate action globally, including by
driving down the costs of carbon-free technologies. These actions will ultimately sup-
port security and stability worldwide.
• Quality of life. Modernizing the American economy to achieve net-zero can fundamen-
tally improve the way we live. Measures like high-speed rail and transit-oriented

tional Communication and Biennial Report to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). 
Page 9 development not only reduce emissions but also create more connected, accessible, and 
healthier communities. 
The 2050 net-zero emissions goal is achievable. The United States can deliver net-zero emis-
sions across all sectors and GHGs through multiple pathways, but all viable routes to net-zero 
involve five key transformations: 
1. Decarbonize electricity. Electricity delivers diverse services to all sectors of the American
economy. The transition to a clean electricity system has been accelerating in recent
years—driven by plummeting costs for solar and wind technologies, federal and subna-
tional policies, and consumer demand. Building on this success, the United States has
set a goal of 100% clean electricity by 2035, a crucial foundation for net-zero emissions
no later than 2050.
2. Electrify end uses and switch to other clean fuels. We can affordably and efficiently elec-
trify most of the economy, from cars to buildings and industrial processes. In areas
where electrification presents technology challenges—for instance aviation, shipping,
and some industrial processes—we can prioritize clean fuels like carbon-free hydrogen
and sustainable biofuels.
3. Cut energy waste. Moving to cleaner sources of energy is made faster, cheaper, and eas-
ier when existing and new technologies use less energy to provide the same or better
service. This can be achieved through diverse, proven approaches, ranging from more
efficient appliances and the integration of efficiency into new and existing buildings, to
sustainable manufacturing processes.
4. Reduce methane and other non-CO  emissions. Non-CO  gases such as methane, hydro-
2 2
fluorocarbons (HFCs), nitrous oxide (N O), and others, contribute significantly to warm-
2
ing—with methane alone contributing fully half of current net global warming of 1.0°C.
There are many profitable or low-cost options to reduce non-CO  sources, such as im-
2
plementing methane leak detection and repair for oil and gas systems and shifting from
HFCs to climate-friendly working fluids in cooling equipment. The U.S. is committed to
taking comprehensive and immediate actions to reduce methane domestically. And
through the Global Methane Pledge, the U.S. and partners seek to reduce global me-
thane emissions by at least 30% by 2030, which would eliminate over 0.2°C of warming
by 2050. The U.S. will also prioritize research and development to unlock the innovation
needed for deep emissions reductions beyond currently available technologies.
5. Scale up CO  removal. In the three decades to 2050, our emissions from energy produc-
2
tion can be brought close to zero, but certain emissions such as non-CO  from agricul-
2
ture will be difficult to decarbonize completely by mid-century. Reaching net-zero
emissions will therefore require removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, using
Page 10 processes and technologies that are rigorously evaluated and validated. This requires 
scaling up land carbon sinks as well as engineered strategies.  
Figure ES-2 illustrates how the five key transformations can combine in different pathways to 
achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. The exact pathway will depend on how quickly change oc-
curs across different sectors. Nevertheless, some broad patterns are clear. For example, energy 
system transformations contribute roughly 4.5 gigatons of CO equivalent per year (Gt CO e/yr.) 
2  2
of overall emissions reductions, or about 70% of overall reductions. These energy emissions re-
ductions are delivered by cutting energy waste, decarbonizing electricity, and transitioning en-
ergy sources including through fuel switching and electrification. Addressing non-CO  gases, 
2
including methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases, reduces another 1 Gt of annual emis-
sions. Enhancing land sinks and scaling up CO  removal technologies also deliver about 1 Gt of 
2
negative emissions. While these figures are a helpful rough guide, the exact contribution from 
each area varies between pathways (as shown in Figure ES-2). The eventual U.S. pathway to 
net-zero emissions will depend on the evolution of technologies, the specifics of policy and reg-
ulatory packages, and factors such as economic growth, sociodemographic shifts, and market 
prices for commodities and fuels across the next three decades.  
Figure ES-2: Emissions Reductions Pathways to Achieve 2050 Net-Zero Emissions in the 
United States. Achieving net-zero across the entire U.S. economy requires contributions 
from all sectors, including: efficiency, clean power, and electrification; reducing me-
thane and other non-CO  gases; and enhancing natural and technological CO  removal.

The left side of the figure shows a representative pathway with high levels of action 
Page 11 across all sectors to achieve net-zero by 2050. The right side shows a set of alternative 
pathways depending on variations in uncertain factors such as trends in relative technol-
ogy costs and the strength of the land sector carbon sink.  Across all scenarios, contribu-
tions from energy efficiency range from 10-19% (transportation contributions range 
from 5-7%, buildings from 2-9%, and industry from 1-5%). Contributions from decarbon-
izing electricity range from 22-25% (renewables contributions range from 15-18%, and 
fossil fuel with CCS from 6-8%). Contributions from energy transitions range from 34-
44% (hydrogen contributions range from 5-10%, low-carbon fuels from 16-21%, and 
electrification from 8-15%). Contributions from non-CO2 reductions range from 9-10% 
(contributions from methane range from 6-7%, N2O from 1-2%, and F-gas reduction at 
1%). Contributions from land sink enhancement range from 1-6%. Contributions from 
CO2 removal range from 6-8%. 
Achieving net-zero by no later than 2050 requires sustained, coordinated action spanning four 
strategic pillars:  
1. Federal leadership. Federal leadership is critical to reduce emissions 50-52% below 2005
levels in 2030 and set up the economy to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. This could
include investments and incentives that support the deployment of clean technologies
in all sectors, policies to enhance and support our natural and working lands, partner-
ships to catalyze market transformation, improved integration of climate into financial
markets including enhanced climate risk disclosure, and the promulgation and enforce-
ment of new and existing regulations rooted in law.
2. Innovation. In driving the deployment of currently competitive technologies as rapidly as
possible, federal policies will serve to further reduce costs through economies of scale
and learning-by-doing. In addition, new technologies will be necessary to drive deeper
reductions in the late 2020’s through 2050. Federally-supported research, development,
demonstration, and deployment can be the prime mover—along with federal, subna-
tional, and private sector procurement—to carry new carbon-free technologies and pro-
cesses from the lab to U.S. factories to the market. Research and development today
will lay the technology foundation necessary to maximize economic benefits from the
post-2030 transformation to net-zero.
3. Non-federal leadership. The U.S. federal system is based on the national government
sharing power with elected governments at subnational levels. In our system, policy au-
thorities related to economic activity, energy, transportation, land use, and more are
shared with Tribal governments, states, cities, counties, and others. U.S. climate action
therefore necessarily spans all levels of government. Recent trends demonstrate the sig-
nificant impacts that these subnational policies can have on the overall U.S. emissions
Page 12 trajectory, in ways that complement national policies and can provide a broader base 
for learning and for accelerating action.  
4.  All-of-society action. The long-term transformations to get to 2050 net-zero emissions 
will require the United States to bring all its greatest strengths to bear, including innova-
tion, creativity, and diversity. Already, many non-governmental organizations are acting 
ambitiously to address climate change within their own operations or support the over-
all transition of the U.S. economy. Even more broad-based engagement on research, ed-
ucation, and implementation through our universities, cultural institutions, investors, 
businesses, and other non-governmental organizations will be required to reach our 
2050 goal.  
 
Implementation is underway. These four principles form the core of our strategy to achieve 
our 2030 NDC and 100% clean electricity by 2035. We are moving rapidly, rooted in actions 
from across the federal government and other governmental and non-governmental actors. 
These actions and policies are part of our Long-Term Strategy and are described in a forthcom-
ing companion report to this document, The U.S. National Climate Strategy (NCS)  [2]. The NCS 
describes an overarching approach that covers all aspects of federal action, which will also sup-
port broader non-federal and all-of-society efforts. Both the NCS and this Long-Term Strategy 
have been informed by a robust stakeholder engagement process. These actions provide the 
near-term implementation momentum to achieve the 2030 NDC, 2035 100% clean electricity 
goal, and the 2050 net-zero goal.  
 
If other major economies adopt similar ambition, we can keep 1.5°C within reach. The U.S. 
currently emits 11% of annual global GHGs (second to China, which emits 27% of the global to-
tal). Cutting our emissions at least in half by 2030 and eliminating our emissions by 2050 will 
therefore make an important direct contribution to keeping a safer 1.5°C future within reach. 
These efforts will also spur cost reductions for clean technologies through scale and learning-
by-doing. More importantly, U.S. climate leadership has already helped propel other major 
economies to adopt 2030 NDCs that are aligned with the imperative to cut global emissions at 
least 40% by 2030 to improve our chances of limiting global warming to less than 1.5°C. At the 
Leaders’ Summit on Climate in April of 2021, President Biden announced our ambitious NDC, 
joined by Canadian and Japanese leaders who also set strong new 2030 targets. The European 
Union (EU) and United Kingdom (UK) had already set strong targets and, since the Summit, oth-
ers, including the Republic of Korea and South Africa, have come forward with NDCs that 
achieve the pace of reductions that would be needed globally to keep 1.5°C within reach. These 
countries represent well over half of the global economy, but further action by other major 
economies will be necessary to ensure the 1.5oC target is met.  
 
Page 13 
 Globally, this is the moment for all the world’s major economies to act to rapidly reduce emis-
sions to meet ambitious 2030 NDC targets and to develop and communicate strategies to 
achieve ambitious 2050 net-zero goals. 
Box 1: Four Components of U.S. Reporting on Climate Actions and Strategy 
Communicating actions and progress toward climate goals is a critical component of transpar-
ency to support global ambition under the Paris Agreement. The United States is committed to 
these principles and, accordingly, is issuing four reports detailing complementary aspects of our 
current climate activities and planned strategy. The same key assumptions and methodologies 
are shared in the analytics that inform all four reports. Each report serves a different role in 
communicating the overall situation and strategy of the United States, and there are details in 
each that are not reproduced across all reports. Together they present a vision for our climate 
strategy and emissions pathways. 
1. The U.S. National Climate Strategy details how we will deliver our U.S. NDC for 2030
[2]. It focuses on the immediate policies and actions that will put America on track to re-
duce emissions by 50-52% below 2005 levels in 2030 and put in place the technology and 
infrastructure necessary to achieve net-zero emissions no later than 2050.
2. The Long-Term Strategy of the United States to Reach Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 (this 
report), pursuant to Article 4.19 of the Paris Agreement, shows how these current and 
near-term policies and other actions across the country, as described in the NCS, deliver 
a pathway through the 2030s and 2040s to reach our 2050 net-zero goal. As a contribu-
tion under the Paris Agreement, it is part of a process that serves to support enhanced 
global action and ambition.
3. The U.S. National Communication and Biennial Report provides detailed information on 
existing policies and measures across all areas of U.S. climate action as of December 
2020  [7]. It fulfills our obligations for reporting and transparency under the UN Frame-
work Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and fits into a broader international re-
porting framework in which other countries also participate.
4. The U.S. Adaptation Communication provides forward-looking priorities for accelerat-
ing adaptation and building resilience domestically and abroad  [8]. It outlines domestic 
climate impacts and vulnerabilities, progress on adaptation, lessons learned, and imme-
diate policies and other approaches that will increase adaptive capacity, enhance resili-
ence, and reduce vulnerability to climate change. It complements and builds upon 
resilience and adaptation actions laid out in the National Climate Strategy and U.S. Na-
tional Communication and Biennial Report.
Page 14 Chapter 1: An Integrated U.S. Climate Strategy to Reach Net-
Zero Emissions by 2050  
Climate change already inflicts serious damage on the United States and the world, particularly 
the most vulnerable that are least equipped to adapt—and the science is clear that, without 
faster global action, these impacts will become much more frequent and severe. Two recent re-
ports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  [1]  [9] affirm with robust scientific 
confidence the need to keep warming under 1.5°C to reduce the greatest global risks and avoid 
significant, wide-ranging, and severe impacts. To keep 1.5°C within reach, the United States has 
a goal of achieving net-zero emissions economy-wide by no later than 2050  [3]  [4]  [5].  
 
The Paris Agreement establishes a framework to rapidly increase global ambition to hold warm-
ing well below 2°C while pursuing efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C. This framework includes na-
tionally determined contributions (NDCs)—commitments that target near-term emissions 
reductions, review progress, and seek to extend and strengthen their NDCs in regular 5-year cy-
cles. The Paris Agreement also specifically calls on all countries to “formulate and communicate 
their long-term, low GHG emission development strategies.” Such Long-Term Strategies sup-
port global ambition by encouraging countries to understand their options and set their own 
longer-term emissions reduction goals  [10]. In developing and communicating these strategies  
[11], countries can foresee and address challenges such as slow infrastructure turnover or the 
need for just transitions from fossil fuels and other high-emission technologies. Developing and 
sharing publicly these near- and long-term strategies helps elucidate and manage path depend-
encies and better connect short-term and long-term objectives. Accordingly, this process can 
both guide national action and encourage greater global ambition over time.  
 
The United States is simultaneously pursuing multiple climate mitigation goals (Figure 1). Each 
goal serves as an important milestone toward rapidly reducing our GHG emissions to net-zero. 
While this report emphasizes the longer period of 2021-2050, the overall U.S. strategy inte-
grates actions for both near-term and 2050 goals: 
•  The 2030 NDC of 50-52% reductions below 2005 levels, covering all sectors and all gases 
•  The goal for 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035 
•  The goal for net-zero emissions no later than 2050.

Figure 1: United States historic emissions and projected emissions under the 2050 goal 
for net-zero. This figure shows historical U.S. GHG emissions from 1990 to 2019, the 
projected pathway to the 2030 NDC of 50-52% below 2005 levels, and the 2050 net-zero 
goal. The United States has also set a goal for 100% clean electricity in 2035. That goal is 
not an economy-wide emissions goal so does not appear in this figure, but it will be criti-
cal to support decarbonization in the electricity sector, which will in turn help the U.S. 
reach its 2030 and 2050 goals. For the period 1900-2020, real US emissions increased 
through 2007, then declined through 2020, reaching 17% below 2005 levels in 2020 (ap-
prox. 5.5 gigatons CO2e). For the period 2020-2025, projected US emissions fall to 26-
28% below 2005 levels in 2025 (approx. 5 gigatons CO2e). For the period 2025-2030, 
projected US emissions fall more sharply, reaching 50-52% below 2005 levels in 2030 
(approx. 3 gigatons CO2e). For the period 2030-2050, projected US emissions fall slightly 
less sharply, reaching -100% from 2005 levels in 2050 (0 gigatons CO2e). 
 
These near-term actions are being implemented rapidly, rooted in policies from across the fed-
eral government and other governmental and non-governmental actors in the United States. 
These actions and policies are described in detail in a companion to this document, The U.S. Na-
tional Climate Strategy (NCS)  [2]. The NCS lays out an overarching policy approach being under-
taken today that covers all aspects of federal action, in support of all-of-society efforts. These 
actions provide the near-term implementing momentum to achieve the 2030 NDC, meet the 
2035 100% clean electricity goal, and put the U.S. in a strong position to take the additional ac-
tions necessary to achieve net-zero by 2050. The information on near-term implementation in 
the NCS should therefore be viewed as integral to the U.S. Long-Term Strategy. Accordingly, 
Page 16 
 although this report focuses on the period from 2021 to 2050, it refers to the NCS for further 
descriptions of near-term implementation of long-term goals.  
 
The Biden Administration consulted diverse stakeholders to inform the overall U.S. climate 
strategy that is reflected in the U.S. Long-Term Strategy (LTS) report. This consultation covered 
a wide range of stakeholders, from major unions that work on behalf of millions of American 
workers, to groups representing tens of millions of advocates, fence line communities, and 
young Americans. Engagement to develop our strategy also included groups representing scien-
tists; hundreds of governmental leaders like governors, mayors, and Native American leaders; 
hundreds of businesses; hundreds of schools and institutions of higher education; as well as 
with many specialized researchers focused on questions of pollution reduction. The NCS report 
referenced above has similarly been developed through extensive consultations of diverse 
stakeholders, whose perspectives and input have informed the overall climate strategy that is 
reflected in this LTS report. 
  
The United States presented its first Long-Term Strategy report in 2016 [12], focused on reduc-
ing net GHGs 80-90% below 2005 levels by 2050. In 2021, the United States put forward a new, 
ambitious goal of net-zero emissions no later than 2050. This report presents an updated 2021 
Long-Term Strategy of the United States that defines multiple pathways for the American econ-
omy to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. It includes analysis of what transformational path-
ways to net-zero could look like over time for emissions in different sectors and for different 
GHGs. The report draws from a diverse analytical toolkit,4 integrating insights from a global in-
tegrated assessment model covering all greenhouses and economic sectors, a national CO  
2
model with high resolution on the electricity sector, models of U.S. land sector, and more. The 
analysis presented here was based on an interagency effort and is grounded in a broader body 
of existing scholarship and literature for how to understand both near- and long-term high-am-
bition emissions pathways in the national and global context. While the analyses presented 
here provide new and original insights, they also draw from and reference this broader body of 
work.  
 
This report is organized as follows. Chapter 2 focuses on the decisive decade from now to 2030 
and highlights the U.S. priorities which will both dramatically reduce GHG emissions and lay the 
foundation for achieving net-zero emissions no later than 2050. Chapter 3 gives an overview of 
the economy-wide emissions pathways to 2050. Chapter 4 describes pathways for energy-re-
lated CO  emissions reduction across electricity, transportation, buildings, and industry. Chap-
2
ter 5 presents the key opportunities for methane and other non-CO  emissions reductions,

and the U.S. National Communication and Biennial Report to the UNFCCC. 
Page 17 
 including in the energy, waste, agriculture, and industrial sectors. Chapter 6 focuses on CO  re-
2
movals through lands and technologies for carbon dioxide removal. Chapter 7 presents a vision 
of the many benefits that will be created on the path to a net-zero emissions economy, includ-
ing transformative improvements in public health, avoided climate damages, enhanced climate 
security, and job growth. Finally, Chapter 8 concludes with a vision of the U.S. accelerating 
global climate progress with ambitious domestic climate action. 
 
Box 2: The U.S. 2050 Net-Zero Goal 
The United States has set a goal of net-zero emissions by no later than 2050. The goal includes 
all major GHGs (CO , CH , N O, HFCs, PFCs, SF , NF ) and is economy-wide. The goal is on a net 
2 4 2 6 3
basis, including both sources of emissions and removals. It does not include emissions from in-
ternational aviation or international shipping. At this time, the United States does not expect to 
use international market mechanisms toward achievement of this net-zero goal. Progress to-
ward the goal will be assessed and the U.S. LTS may be updated, as appropriate.

 Chapter 2: The Decisive Decade to 2030 
Putting the United States on a path to net-zero emissions economy-wide no later than 2050 re-
quires taking transformative actions this decade and achieving near-term milestones in line 
with this goal. This is why the United States set an economy-wide target of reducing its net GHG 
emissions by 50-52% below 2005 levels in 2030 (Figure 2). The United States will also soon re-
lease a complementary report, The U.S. National Climate Strategy (NCS)  [2], following this 2021 
Long-Term Strategy, to provide additional detail on the steps the United States is taking to 
achieve our 2030 target—and in doing so, to put the United States on a track to achieve its 
2050 net-zero goal. This 2030 commitment anchors the U.S. approach during this decade to 
build a sustainable, resilient, and equitable economy by rapidly deploying widely available low-
carbon technologies and investing in the infrastructure, innovation, and workforce that is the 
foundation of this economic transformation. 
 
Figure 2: United States historic emissions and projected emissions under the 2030 NDC 
target. This figure shows the historical trajectory of U.S. GHG emissions and the path-
way to the 2030 GHG reduction targets. The 2030 NDC target is ambitious, and policies 
and measures have put the American economy on a declining emissions trend con-
sistent with these goals. The 2030 targets put the United States on a faster track than a 
straight-line path to net-zero in 2050 would require. For the period 1900-2020, real US 
emissions increased through 2007, then declined through 2020, reaching 17% below 
2005 levels in 2020 (approx. 5.5 gigatons CO2e). For the period 2020-2025, projected US 
emissions fall to 26-28% below 2005 levels in 2025 (approx. 5 gigatons CO2e). For the 
period 2025-2030, projected US emissions fall more sharply, reaching 50-52% below 
2005 levels in 2030 (approx. 3 gigatons CO2e). 
 
Page 19 
 This decade will be decisive—and the benefits of achieving our 2030 goal will be significant. 
Transitioning to a clean energy economy will create between 500,000 and one million net new 
jobs across the country this decade  [13] [14]. Moreover, reducing air pollution through these 
efforts will avoid 85,000–300,000 premature deaths  [14] [15]. This transition will require a 
multi-pronged approach involving the private sector, sub-national governments, and federal 
government to generate new regulations, direct investment, and programs at all levels of gov-
ernment.  
Near-term actions to accelerate this transition are being implemented rapidly, rooted in actions 
from across the federal government and other governmental and non-governmental actors in 
the United States. These actions and policies are described in detail in the NCS report, which 
lays out an overarching policy approach being undertaken today–informed by ongoing engage-
ment of diverse stakeholders–that covers all aspects of federal action, in support of all-of-soci-
ety efforts. These actions provide the near-term implementing momentum to achieve the 2030 
NDC, 2035 100% clean electricity goal, and the 2050 net-zero goal.  A summary of these ele-
ments is provided below. 
2.1 Electricity 
Fast and cost-effective emission-reducing investments are available in the electric power sec-
tor, which is currently the second-largest producer of emissions in the United States. That is 
why the United States set a goal to reach a 100% carbon pollution-free electricity system by 
2035, which can be achieved through multiple cost-effective technology and investment path-
ways. In fact, this transition has already been accelerating in recent years—driven by plummet-
ing costs of key technologies like solar, onshore wind, offshore wind, and batteries, as well as 
enhanced policies and increased consumer demand for clean, reliable, and affordable power. 
Further acceleration of clean energy deployment can be catalyzed through providing incentives 
and standards to reduce pollution from power plants; investing in technologies to increase the 
flexibility of the electricity system, such as transmission, energy efficiency, energy storage, 
smart and connected buildings, and non-emitting fuels; and leveraging carbon capture and stor-
age (CCS) and nuclear. Significant deployment of energy efficiency reduces overall demand and 
can lower peak load, reducing grid capital costs and making investments in carbon-free power 
generation go further. Research, development, demonstration, and deployment of new soft-
ware and hardware solutions will further support the transformation to a carbon pollution-free, 
resilient, reliable, and affordable electricity system. 
Page 20 2.2 Transportation 
Vehicles have become the largest emissions source in the United States—driven by fossil fuel 
use in light-duty cars, trucks, and SUVs, followed by medium- and heavy-duty trucks, buses, air, 
off-road vehicles, rail, and shipping. There are many opportunities to reduce GHG emissions 
from transportation while also saving money for households and businesses, improving envi-
ronmental quality and health in communities, and providing more choices for moving people 
and goods. At its core, this requires electrifying most vehicles to run on ever-cleaner electricity 
and shifting to low-carbon or carbon-free biofuels and hydrogen in applications like long-dis-
tance shipping and aviation.  
 
To support this outcome, the United States set a goal for half of all new light-duty cars sold in 
2030 to be zero-emission vehicles, to produce 3 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel by 
2030, and to accelerate deployment and reduce costs in every mode of transportation. This will 
occur through lower vehicle costs; fuel economy and emissions standards in light-, medium- 
and heavy-duty vehicles; incentives for zero-emission vehicles and clean fuels; investment in a 
new charging infrastructure to support multi-unit dwellings, public charging, and long-distance 
travel; scaling up biorefineries; comprehensive innovation investments to reduce hydrogen 
costs; and investment in infrastructure that supports all modes of clean transportation—such as 
transit, rail, biking, micro mobility, and pedestrian options.  
 
Making progress this decade requires investing in domestic manufacturing and reliable supply 
chains for clean fuels, batteries, and vehicles. In addition, research, development, demonstra-
tion, and deployment of electrification and zero- or low-carbon fuels for aviation and shipping 
will ensure we have the technology to continue reducing emissions across the entire transpor-
tation sector in the years leading to 2050.  
2.3 Buildings 
Buildings and their energy-consuming systems—electricity used and fossil fuels burned on site 
for heating air, heating water, and cooking—have long lifetimes. Therefore, the priority in this 
decade is to rapidly improve energy efficiency and increase the sales share of clean and effi-
cient electric appliances—including heat pumps for space conditioning, heat pump water heat-
ers, electric and induction stoves, and electric clothes dryers—while also improving the 
affordability of energy and the equitable access to efficient appliances, efficiency retrofits, and 
clean distributed energy resources in buildings. This includes investment in public buildings 
such as public housing, government facilities, schools, and universities. Research and demon-
stration investments now will also advance new solutions for efficient, grid-interactive, and 
electrified buildings.  
 
Page 21 
 Achieving 100% clean power generation by 2035 will also eliminate upstream emissions from 
electricity and facilitate carbon-free and efficient electrification of appliances and equipment in 
buildings. Moreover, partnerships like the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ENERGY 
STAR and the advancement of building energy codes and appliance standards will ensure that 
building envelopes, electric appliances, and other equipment become increasingly efficient over 
time. Efficient electric space heating and cooling and water heating offer important opportuni-
ties to employ grid-interactive demand to lower energy bills for households and businesses 
while more cost-effectively utilizing carbon-free electricity. 
 
2.4 Industry 
The industrial sector emits GHGs through multiple complex pathways. This includes CO  emit-
2
ted indirectly through electricity and directly through on-site fossil fuel combustion and power 
generation, as well as emissions of CO  and non-CO  GHGs leaked from on-site use or emitted 
2 2
through industrial processes (such as cement production). Industrial decarbonization can be de-
livered through energy efficiency; industrial electrification; low-carbon fuels, feedstock, and en-
ergy sources; and industrial CCS. Achieving clean power by 2035 will eliminate the emissions 
from grid power consumed by industry and make possible the carbon-free electrification of cer-
tain industrial processes that are currently dominated by fossil fuel use. Low- and medium-tem-
perature process heat are candidates for industrial electrification in the near term through 
increased use of industrial heat pumps, electric boilers, or electromagnetic heating processes.  
 
Additional technologies and process innovations are also needed to address other industrial 
emissions, including high-temperature heat and process emissions from steel, petrochemical, 
and cement production. Fundamentally new processes will be needed to address the chemical 
process emissions associated with the production of these commodity materials that have large 
GHG emissions footprints. Energy efficiency measures make carbon-free electricity and other 
low-carbon industrial fuels stretch as far as possible and as early as possible.  
 
The United States will also scale support for related research, development, demonstration, 
commercialization, and deployment of zero-carbon industrial innovations. This includes incen-
tives for carbon capture and new sources of clean hydrogen—produced from renewable en-
ergy, nuclear energy, or waste—to power industrial facilities. To drive the market for these 
solutions, the United States government will also use its procurement power to support early 
markets for these very low- and zero-carbon industrial goods.  
 
Additionally, monitoring and control technologies are needed to prevent the release to the at-
mosphere of non-CO  GHGs from industrial operations, including methane, fluorinated gases, 
2
black carbon, and other potent short-lived climate pollutants. The United States has finalized 
Page 22 
 regulations to phase down the use of fluorinated gases consistent with our obligations under 
the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol. Addressing methane emissions will also re-
quire setting stringent standards for oil and gas production and investing in plugging leaks from 
coal, oil, and gas mines and wells.  
 
2.5 Agriculture, Forestry, and Land Use 
America’s vast lands provide opportunities to both reduce emissions and sequester carbon. 
Capitalizing on these opportunities includes: continuing to expand forest area, extending rota-
tion lengths, protecting forest area, integrating trees into urban areas and agriculture, scaling 
up climate-smart agricultural practices such as cover crops, and employing rotational grazing on 
our agricultural lands. Even more leverage can be derived through programs and incentives to 
improve agricultural productivity; such practices and technologies can free up land for other 
uses, as well as reduce agricultural methane and N O emissions through, for example, improved 
2
manure management and improved cropland nutrient management. Enhanced investment in 
forest protection and forest management, along with science-based and sustainable efforts to 
reduce the scope and intensity of catastrophic wildfires and to restore fire-damaged forest 
land, are vital to protecting and growing the largest land sink. Alongside these efforts, the 
United States will support nature-based coastal resilience projects including pre-disaster plan-
ning, as well as efforts to increase carbon sequestration in waterways and oceans by pursuing 
“blue carbon.” Finally, climate-smart practices can also lower the emissions intensity of biofuels 
needed for decarbonizing transportation. Actions taken now and through this decade will en-
sure we maximize the potential of our lands and waters to sequester carbon to the greatest ex-
tent possible by 2050.  
 
Across these sectors, the U.S. federal government is working with Tribal governments, states, 
and localities to support rapid deployment of new carbon-pollution-free technologies and facili-
ties while ensuring they meet robust and rigorous standards for workers, public and environ-
mental safety, and environmental justice. Accomplishing the goals this decade and setting up 
the economy for further reductions after 2030 also requires investment in innovation and U.S. 
manufacturing to lower the cost of new technologies needed in the future, grow the domestic 
manufacturing base and supply chains for those technologies, and train the workforce needed.

 Chapter 3: Pathways to 2050 Net-Zero Emissions in the United 
States 
The decisive decade through 2030 is central to setting the United States—and the world—on a 
pathway that keeps warming of 1.5°C within reach.  For all countries, 2030 is an essential way-
point that is part of a longer path to reach global net-zero emissions by mid-century. The ambi-
tious policies and goals described in Chapter 2 will set the United States on a pathway to 
achieve our 2030 target. At the same time, these actions will also catalyze the longer-term 
changes in the American energy, industrial, and land systems required to achieve net-zero by 
2050.  
This chapter presents the results of a comprehensive analysis undertaken to assess potential 
pathways to net-zero emissions in the United States by no later than 2050. These pathways are 
all grounded in our strategy to achieve our 2030 NDC and our goal of 100% carbon pollution-
free electricity by 2035. These transition pathways are not only affordable, but, because of the 
benefits from reduced climate change and improved public health, they will also create wide-
ranging benefits (see Chapter 7). It will require ambitious action and investment grounded in 
intensive engagement with communities, workers, and businesses to ensure that the benefits 
of the transition are equitably distributed—with a focus on those communities that remain 
overburdened and underserved.  
3.1 Assessing Mitigation Opportunities to Achieve Net-Zero Emissions 
Achieving rapid emissions reductions requires integrating near-term policy drivers with a strat-
egy to assess and manage longer-term factors like capital stock turnover and technological in-
novation. To this end, this LTS employs diverse analytical approaches to project the impact of 
alternate assumptions about policies, technologies, and other drivers. These afford a broad un-
derstanding for what long-term net-zero technology transformations would look like globally  
[16]as well as providing roadmaps for how to affect those transitions rapidly  [17].
In light of the Paris goals to develop and communicate national emissions reductions pathways, 
such analytical approaches have also been applied to understanding specific national circum-
stances and opportunities, including those within the United States. Some of these U.S.-specific 
studies focus on policy frameworks to drive near-term action that would set the U.S. on a path-
way to longer-term net-zero or 1.5°C-compatible emissions [18]  [19]  [20]. In parallel, others 
look at the potential for integrating all-of-society strategies that include diverse levels of gov-
ernment and other actors  [21]. Others have focused on overall long-term technological trans-
formations and associated emission reduction strategies that would be necessary for reduction 
to net-zero in the U.S. by 2050. Many of these 2050 studies address emissions reduction across 
Page 24 the entire economy and for all gases [14]  [22]  [23]; others focus on specific areas or sectors 
such as energy, electricity  [13] [24], transportation [25], or manufacturing  [26]. This research 
has advanced thinking about what is possible within the United States and what robust strate-
gies to reach 2050 net-zero could look like. The assessment and analytical approaches pre-
sented here are original to this report but also recognize the many insights offered in this wider 
literature, including but not limited to studies specifically on 2050 net-zero pathways. Insights 
from this literature are consistent in what they tell us about the critical elements supporting the 
long-term emissions reduction trajectory for the United States.  
This trajectory rests on the integration of five complementary technological transformations: 
1. Decarbonize electricity. Electricity delivers diverse services to all sectors of the American 
economy. The transition to a clean electricity system has been accelerating in recent 
years—driven by plummeting costs for solar and wind technologies, federal and subna-
tional policies, and consumer demand. Building on this success, the United States has 
set a goal of 100% clean electricity by 2035, a crucial foundation for net-zero by 2050.
2. Electrify end uses and switch to other clean fuels. We can affordably and efficiently elec-
trify most of the economy—from cars to buildings and industrial processes. In areas 
where electrification presents technology challenges—for instance aviation, shipping, 
and some industrial processes—we can prioritize clean fuels like carbon-free hydrogen 
and sustainable biofuels.
3. Cut energy waste. Moving to cleaner sources of energy is made faster, cheaper, and eas-
ier when existing and new technologies use less energy to provide the same or better 
service. This can be achieved through diverse, proven approaches, ranging from new 
and more efficient appliances and the integration of efficiency into new and existing 
buildings, to sustainable alternate manufacturing processes and the integration of effi-
ciency into new and existing buildings.
4. Reduce methane and other non-CO  emissions. Non-CO  gases such as methane, HFCs, 
2 2
nitrous oxide, and others contribute significantly to warming, with methane alone con-
tributing fully half of current net global warming of 1.0°C. There are many profitable or 
low-cost options to reduce non-CO  sources, such as implementing methane leak detec-
2
tion and repair for oil and gas systems and shifting from HFCs to climate-friendly work-
ing fluids in cooling equipment. The U.S. is committed to taking comprehensive and 
immediate actions to reduce methane domestically. And through the Global Methane 
Pledge, the U.S. and partners seek to reduce global methane emissions by at least 30%
by 2030, which would eliminate over 0.2°C of warming by 2050. The U.S. will also priori-
tize research and development to unlock the innovation needed for deep emissions re-
ductions beyond currently available technologies.
Page 256.  Scale up CO  removal. In the three decades to 2050, our emissions from energy produc-
2
tion can be brought close to zero but certain emissions such as non-CO  from agriculture 
2
will be difficult to decarbonize completely by mid-century. Reaching net-zero emissions 
will therefore require removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, using processes 
and technologies that are rigorously evaluated and validated. This requires scaling up 
land carbon sinks as well as engineered strategies.  
 
There are many plausible pathways through 2050 to achieving a net-zero emissions economy. 
However, developments in these sectors over time are interdependent. For example, wide-
spread adoption in leading energy efficiency practices in buildings could significantly impact 
overall electricity demand, reducing the amount of new clean energy installations required. The 
insight that sectors are interdependent demonstrates the importance of policy and incentives 
to realize the benefits of decarbonization across the economy. Recent developments in energy, 
manufacturing, and information technology have made swift and substantial reductions possi-
ble. Well-designed policies can help to ensure rapid and affordable economy-wide decarboniza-
tion. For example, accelerated shifting to carbon-free power makes end-use electrification an 
even more effective strategy to drive down emissions. In addition, policies can maximize the 
benefits of decarbonization and ensure that underserved communities benefit equitably from 
the transition to a clean energy system. For example, inclusive investment programs to scale up 
financing for efficient electric home upgrades can help level the playing field for underserved 
households and ensure effective consumer protections. 
 
3.2 Current U.S. GHG Emissions Trends in 2021 
Net U.S. GHG emissions peaked in 2007  [27] after growing through much of the previous cen-
tury, driven mainly by combustion of fossil fuels to meet growing demand for energy services. 
Since their peak, net U.S. GHG emissions have declined, driven by a combination of forces. Fed-
eral policy has played a crucial role, including through sustained research and development in-
vestments which propelled an initial shift from coal to gas power and the simultaneous and 
now dominant growth of renewables; incentives for renewables and zero-emission vehicles; 
and sector-specific regulations such as emissions standards for power plants, fuel economy 
standards, and appliance efficiency standards. Tribal governments, U.S. states, cities, counties, 
and other non-federal actors have played a similarly crucial role across all sectors of the econ-
omy. Moreover, this federal and subnational investment and policy has propelled a virtuous cy-
cle of technology cost reductions inducing even larger markets for key carbon-free technologies 
which, in turn, drives further cost reductions through scale and learning.  
 
Page 26 
 3.3. Analysis of Potential U.S. Trajectories to Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 
The new analysis presented here offers insights into what the overall emissions profile for the 
United States could look like between now and 2050 under a set of alternate assumptions 
about the evolution of technological costs, economic growth, and other drivers to 2050. We use 
two economy-wide models (GCAM and OP-NEMS), a range of sensitivity scenarios, supple-
mental models for key sectors, and comparisons to the growing literature on pathways to net-
zero emissions. This provides transparency on what the possible pathways to 2050 net-zero 
might look like, and how those different pathways would affect the evolution of specific sectors 
and rates of deployment for specific technologies.  
 
The assessment presented in this chapter reflects model outputs that are subject to several 
types of uncertainty. The goal of showing these outputs is to illustrate the evolution of the U.S. 
economy and resulting emissions over time.  While the technology assumptions and policy 
goals for the decade to 2030 are largely understood, there is increasing uncertainty after 2030 
on how any individual technology or sector will evolve. We show several different pathways 
based on alternate assumptions. These sensitivities illustrate a range of credible and plausible 
pathways to net-zero by 2050.  
 
3.3.1 Descriptions of the Models  
 
Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM) 
The LTS scenarios were produced in the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM) by the Pacific 
Northwest National Laboratory. The Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM) is an integrated as-
sessment model covering all major GHGs and all sectors of the economy, linking the world's en-
ergy, agriculture, and land use systems with a climate model. It is used to explore the 
interactions of emissions-reducing investments and activities across the U.S. and global econ-
omy. The model is designed to assess climate change policies and technology strategies for the 
globe over long time scales. GCAM runs in 5-year time steps from 2005 to 2100 and includes 32 
geopolitical regions in the energy and economy module and 384 land regions in the agriculture 
and land use module. The model tracks emissions and atmospheric concentrations of GHGs 
(CO  and non-CO ), carbonaceous aerosols, sulfur dioxide, and reactive gases and provides esti-
2 2
mates of the associated climate impacts, such as global mean temperature rise and sea level 
rise. GCAM can incorporate emissions pricing and emission constraints in conjunction with the 
numerous technology options including solar, wind, nuclear, and carbon capture and sequestra-
tion. The model has been exercised extensively to explore the effect of technology and policy 
on climate change and the cost of mitigating climate change. GCAM is a community model 
Page 27 
 primarily developed and maintained at the Joint Global Change Research Institute, a partner-
ship between Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) and the University of Maryland  
[28]
Office of Policy – National Energy Modeling System (OP-NEMS) 
The LTS scenarios were constructed using a version of the National Energy Modeling System 
(NEMS) developed by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Policy (OP-NEMS). NEMS 
is an integrated energy-economy modeling system for the United States that projects the 
produc-tion, imports, conversion, and consumption of energy, subject to assumptions on 
macroeco-nomic and financial factors, world energy markets, resource availability and costs, 
cost and performance characteristics of energy technologies, and demographics. The version of 
NEMS used in this report has been run by OnLocation, Inc., with modeling approach 
determined with input from the DOE Office of Policy and other DOE technology offices. Because 
OP-NEMS pro-jects only CO  emissions related to the energy sector, external assumptions were 
2
provided re-garding non-CO  GHGs and land use, land-use change, and forestry. OP-NEMS 
2
includes enhancements for clean hydrogen, sustainable biofuels, and industrial carbon capture, 
transport, and storage  [29]. 
Global Timber Model (GTM) 
The Global Timber Model (GTM) is a dynamic intertemporal optimization economic model that 
determines timber harvests, timber investments, and land use optimally over time under as-
sumed future market, policy, and environmental conditions. This model’s approach provides a 
simulation of harvesting, planting, and management intensity decisions that landowners might 
undertake in response to timber and carbon market demands, including future price expecta-
tions. These activities include afforestation and land use change, forest management, and for-
est products activity in response to policies and markets. The model generates projections 
using detailed biophysical and economic forestry data for different countries or regions glob-
ally, including the U.S., China, Canada, Russia, and Japan. It used macroeconomic data from An-
nual Energy Outlook 2021 for the U.S. and global parameters from Shared Socioeconomic 
Pathway 2 (SSP2) [30]. The model has been widely used to assess forest dynamics and carbon 
outcomes under various demand and land carbon sink scenarios, climate impacts, and other ap-
plications [31]  [32].  
Forestry and Agriculture Sector Optimization Model with Greenhouse Gases (FASOM-GHG) The 
Forestry and Agriculture Sector Optimization Model with Greenhouse Gases (FASOM-GHG) 
model is a partial-equilibrium dynamic intertemporal, price-endogenous, mathematical pro-
gramming model depicting land transfers and other resource allocations between and within 
the agricultural and forest sectors in the United States. FASOM-GHG includes detailed 
Page 28 representations of agricultural and forest product markets, contemporary forest inventories, 
inter-sectoral resource competition and land change costs, and costs of mitigation strategies. 
The results from FASOM-GHG yield a dynamic simulation of prices, production, management, 
consumption, GHG effects, and other environmental and economic indicators within these two 
sectors, under the chosen policy scenario. The result provides insight into cross-sectoral inter- 
and intra-regional responses to policy stimuli reflecting the spatial heterogeneity in production 
of agriculture and forestry products across the U.S. To date, FASOM-GHG and its predecessor 
models have been used to examine the effects of GHG mitigation policy, climate change im-
pacts, public timber harvest policy, federal farm program policy, bioenergy prospects, and pulp-
wood production by agriculture, among other policies and environmental changes [33].  
 
U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service Resources Planning Act (RPA) modeling 
system 
The LTS scenarios reflect results from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service 
Resources Planning Act (RPA) modeling system which comprises the Forest Dynamics model, 
integrated and harmonized with the USDA Forest Service RPA Land Use Change Model and the 
Forest Resource Outlook Model (FOROM) Global Trade Model  [34]. This modeling system sup-
ports the projections of renewable resources across the U.S. in the USDA 2020 Resources Plan-
ning Act Assessment. Projections were developed under current climate conditions without CO  
2
fertilization and values are added to USDA agriculture soils projections. The storage and flux of 
carbon in harvested wood products and solid waste disposal sites was projected using FOROM.  
 
U.S. EPA Non-CO2 Marginal Abatement Cost (MAC) Model and Report 
The U.S. EPA Non-CO  Marginal Abatement Cost (MAC) Model is a bottom-up engineering cost 
2
model that evaluates the cost and abatement potential of non-CO  mitigation technologies 
2
[35]. The associated non-CO  mitigation report  [36] provides a comprehensive economic analy-
2
sis on the costs of technologies to reduce non-CO  gases and the potential to reduce them by 
2
sector.  
 
3.3.2 Scenario Descriptions & Key Assumptions  
The LTS analysis includes multiple scenarios highlighting different pathways for achieving net-
zero GHG emissions by 2050. The figures in this chapter present results for a range of assump-
tions, including the land sink, technologies (i.e., carbon dioxide removal, sector-specific technol-
ogies, and non-CO  mitigation technologies), energy prices, population, and economic growth.

The advanced LTS scenario assumptions account for currently available opportunities as we 
build back from the pandemic by using advanced assumptions for electricity, transportation, 
industry, and buildings as modeled in GCAM and OP-NEMS.

Table 1: Long-Term Strategy Scenarios. To explore multiple ways to reach our net-zero 
emissions goal in 2050, this analysis includes twelve scenarios (shown in the left most 
column of the table). The ‘Balanced Advanced’ scenario includes medium levels of 
Page 30 
 carbon removals from the atmosphere through our land use, land use change, and for-
estry (LULUCF) sink and carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies, and advanced tech-
nology assumptions allowing for a balanced approach across sectors. The next six 
scenarios explore lower technology assumptions for electricity, transportation, industry, 
buildings, non-CO , and carbon removals, respectively. Next is a scenario that includes 
2
higher levels of carbon removals combined with lower technology assumptions for mul-
tiple sectors. The last four scenarios explore high and low oil and gas price sensitivities, 
and high and low population and GDP growth projections. 
 
The underlying assumptions in the scenario sets are as follows. Carbon removal levels represent 
the sum of the net land sink, derived from modeled projections of land use, land use change, 
and forestry (LULUCF), and plausible levels of carbon dioxide removal technology adoption such 
as biomass energy with CCS and direct air capture from the literature  [37]  [38]. The combined 
carbon removals from these sources are roughly 1,000, 1,400, and 1,800 MtCO  per year in 
2
2050 over the low, medium, and advanced cases, respectively. The advanced and lower tech-
nology assumptions for the electricity and transportation sectors rely largely upon the National 
Renewable Energy Laboratory’s Annual Technology Baseline. The advanced assumptions for the 
buildings and industrial sectors draw on the existing literature and programmatic goals for the 
advanced cases and slower improvements in the lower cases, which are more aligned with 
standard model parameters. For non-CO  reductions, the advanced technology assumptions ac-
2
celerate the availability of low-cost technologies but do not alter long-term costs. Oil and natu-
ral gas prices are calibrated to the 2021 EIA Annual Energy Outlook’s oil and gas supply cases in 
the reference scenario, i.e., without a net-zero 2050 target. Population and GDP, the final set of 
assumptions, span compound annual growth rates from 2020 to 2050 of 0.5% to 0.7% for popu-
lation and 1.1% to 1.8% for GDP. Also, the LULUCF modeling effort included the use of 5 differ-
ent models to generate business as usual and potential mitigation outcomes from different 
land-based activities, including afforestation, improved forest management, harvested wood 
products storage, and fire reduction techniques. This exercise included alignment of several key 
inputs and parameters, including use of input data from the Forest Inventory and Analysis data-
base and, in some cases, application of Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) 2 information for 
macroeconomic drivers. The land use models applied in this analysis did not incorporate as-
sumptions of demand of CCS or bioenergy as mitigation options, as these modeling aspects 
were accommodated in GCAM and OP-NEMS. 
 
3.4 Economy-Wide Pathways to 2050 Net-Zero Emissions 
Achieving the 2050 net-zero goal will require reducing net U.S. emissions from roughly 6.6 Gt 
CO e in 2005 (and 5.7 Gt CO e in 2020), to zero by no later than 2050. As described above, this 
2 2
reduction can result from combinations of five major categories of action: energy efficiency; 
Page 31 
 decarbonizing electricity; fuel switching and energy transitions; sequestering carbon through 
forests, soils, and CO  removal technologies; and reducing non-CO  emissions. Figure 3 presents 
2 2
a vision for how such categories of action can combine to reach net-zero. This figure shows a 
representative pathway from 2005 net emissions levels through 2050 in the form of a waterfall 
chart (the left-hand side of the figure). This representative pathway provides a rough approxi-
mation for reaching net-zero emissions using contributions from all sectors.  
The right-hand side of the figure shows seven additional scenarios from our analysis that are 
based on different assumptions about how technologies and policies will evolve over time. This 
includes a “balanced advanced” scenario with high levels of action across all sectors, as well as 
scenarios where one of the sectors (buildings, industry, transportation, electricity, non-CO , 
2
land sink) contributes a lower level of reductions. These alternate scenarios serve to illustrate 
how the balance across technologies and policy strategies could vary while still reaching the 
net-zero 2050 goal. 
Several broad lessons from this figure are clear. First, in the absence of additional policies, 
emissions would remain largely flat moving forward. Results in the figure show reductions from 
a baseline scenario to 2050—that means that only reductions beyond the baseline scenario are 
reflected in the colored bars. Achieving net-zero emissions will require actions that go far be-
yond business as usual.  
Figure 3: Emissions Reductions Pathways to Achieve 2050 Net-Zero in the United 
States. Achieving net-zero across the entire U.S. economy requires contributions from 
all sectors, including: efficiency, clean power, and electrification; reducing methane and 
Page 32 other non-CO  gases; and enhancing natural and technological CO  removal. The left 
2 2
side of the figure shows a representative pathway with high levels of action across all 
sectors to achieve net-zero by 2050. The right side shows a set of alternative pathways 
depending on variations in uncertain factors such as trends in relative technology costs 
and the strength of the land sector carbon sink.  Across all scenarios, contributions from 
energy efficiency range from 10-19% (transportation contributions range from 5-7%, 
buildings from 2-9%, and industry from 1-5%). Contributions from decarbonizing elec-
tricity range from 22-25% (renewables contributions range from 15-18%, and fossil fuel 
with CCS from 6-8%). Contributions from energy transitions range from 34-44% (hydro-
gen contributions range from 5-10%, low-carbon fuels from 16-21%, and electrification 
from 8-15%). Contributions from non-CO2 reductions range from 9-10% (contributions 
from methane range from 6-7%, N2O from 1-2%, and F-gas reduction at 1%). Contribu-
tions from land sink enhancement range from 1-6%. Contributions from CO2 removal 
range from 6-8%. 
Second, roughly 4.5 Gt of the 6.5 Gt annual reduction from 2005 levels will likely come from 
transforming the energy system. This starts with decarbonizing electricity by shifting to renewa-
bles and other emissions-free power. This shift could lead to over 1 Gt of annual reduction by 
2050. A second pillar of energy transformation is simply to use energy more efficiently to pro-
vide the same services. Solutions like better insulation, advanced heat pumps for space and wa-
ter heating, and efficient computers and electronics can save consumers billions on their annual 
energy bills. Cutting energy waste also reduces the rate of investment needed for new clean en-
ergy generation as demand grows. This pillar alone could contribute roughly 1 Gt of annual re-
ductions by 2050.  A third pillar of energy transformation is to switch as many uses as possible 
to clean energy–including clean electricity, but also including low-carbon fuels and clean hydro-
gen. Efficient electrification of transportation, buildings, and other end uses can also transform 
the energy sector by reducing overall energy demand. Electric motors in vehicles, for example, 
are approximately three times more efficient than internal combustion engines, and electric 
heat pumps are up to three times more efficient than heating with natural gas or electric re-
sistance. These activities would lead to nearly 2 Gt of annual reductions by 2050. 
Third, other non-CO  GHG emissions represent a critical component of the overall reduction 
2
strategy, collectively representing roughly 0.5 Gt of reductions by 2050. These gases have 
sources across many sectors and include methane emissions from agriculture, waste manage-
ment, and fossil fuel use, HFCs used in refrigeration, and N O from agriculture and industry. 
2
Such gases often offer low-cost and high-impact reductions. For example, globally, methane 
accounts for half of the net 1.0°C of warming already occurring. Because of its relatively short 
lifetime in the atmosphere, compared to CO2, rapidly reducing methane emissions is the single 
Page 33most effective strategy to reduce warming over the next 30 years and is crucial in keeping to 
the 1.5°C limit. The United States co-leads with the EU the Global Methane Pledge that aims to 
eliminate over 0.2°C of potential warming by 2050 by cutting global methane pollution at least 
30% by 2030 relative to 2020 levels. As of October 2021, over 30 countries representing about 
30% of global emissions and 60% of the global economy had joined the Pledge (See Box in 
Chapter 5). As detailed in the NCS, the United States is implementing comprehensive actions to 
drive down methane in this decade, including new standards for landfills and oil and gas opera-
tions as well as major investments to remediate abandoned coal, oil, and gas mines and wells. 
The United States is also committed to incentives and innovations to reduce agricultural me-
thane and agricultural N O emissions. Finally, a global HFC phasedown is expected to avoid up 
2
to 0.5°C of global warming by 2100.  
Fourth, removing CO  from the atmosphere is a necessary component for reaching net-zero. 
2
Although most emissions across the economy can be eliminated through the above strategies, a 
few processes or activities that lead to emissions are currently difficult or costly to eliminate or 
have no viable existing substitutes, and despite many available cost-effective mitigation oppor-
tunities, non-CO  GHG emissions cannot be fully reduced to zero. This means that reaching net-
2
zero will require additional contributions from removals until viable zero-emission solutions are 
developed and deployed. Overall, these removals would come from two broad categories of ac-
tivities. One is through nature-based approaches that rely on natural carbon sinks–land and 
ocean–by expanding or enhancing conservation, restoration, sustainable management, and 
other activities that would enhance natural removal of carbon as well as protect our vital natu-
ral ecosystems and related services and biodiversity. A second set of approaches is through var-
ious technologies and processes that directly capture CO  from the atmosphere and store it 
2
(such as direct air or ocean capture, bioenergy with CCS, or enhanced mineralization). Technol-
ogies capable of carbon dioxide removal are available today, but at nascent stages and there-
fore will require additional research, development, and deployment now through 2050 (more 
discussion of CDR technologies can be found in section 6.4).  
Page 34 Chapter 4: Transforming the Energy System Through 2050 
The energy sector is pivotal for achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Achieving net-zero is pos-
sible through a range of pathways, which depend on how technologies and policies evolve over 
the three-decade period. Nevertheless, by modelling a range of pathways with plausible as-
sumptions for this evolution (see Figure 4), we can distinguish broad trends and important driv-
ers of the energy sector transformation.

2 2
sions and direct CO  emissions from the transportation, buildings, and industry fall dra-
2
matically in all scenarios, with the greatest reductions coming from electricity, followed 
by transportation, and non-land sink carbon dioxide removals (CDR) increase. Notes: 
Historical data are from EIA Monthly Energy Reviews, projections include data from all 
LTS scenarios using both GCAM and OP-NEMS, projections are shown in ten-year time 
steps. Transportation: Historical transportation emissions slightly decrease from 2005 to 
2020 from approximately 2 GtCO2e in 2005 to just below 2 GtCO2e before 2020 and to 
approximately 1.6 GtCO2e in 2020. Projected transportation emissions decrease to ap-
proximately 1.3 GtCO2e by 2030, approximately 0.7 GtCO2e by 2040, and to approxi-
mately 0.3 GtCO2e by 2050. The range of projected transportation emissions is roughly 
Page 35 
 0.5 GtCO2e from 2020 through 2050. Buildings: Historical buildings emissions remain 
generally steady from 2005 to 2020 at approximately 0.5 GtCO2e. Projected buildings 
emissions decline steadily, reaching approximately 0.2 GtCO2e by 2050. The range of 
projected buildings emissions increases steadily from 2020, reaching roughly 0.3 
GtCO2e by 2050. Industry: Historical industry emissions remain generally steady from 
2005 to 2020 at approximately 1 GtCO2e. Projected industry emissions decline slightly 
to reach approximately 0.8 GtCO2e through 2040, then decline more sharply to reach 
approximately 0.3 GtCO2e by 2050. The range of projected transportation emissions is 
roughly 0.5 GtCO2e from 2020 through 2050. Electricity: Historical electricity emissions 
decrease sharply from 2005 to 2020 from approximately 2.4 GtCO2e to approximately 
1.4 GtCO2e. Projected electricity emissions decrease sharply through 2030 to reach ap-
proximately 0.5 GtCO2e, more gradually through 2040 to reach close to 0 GtCO2e, then 
decrease through 2050 to reach 0 GtCO2e. The range of projected electricity emissions 
increases from 2020 to 2030, then decreases through 2050. CDR: Projected CDR remov-
als increase from 0 GtCO2e in 2020 to approximately -0.05 GtCo2e in 2030, approxi-
mately -0.2 GtCO2e in 2040, and approximately -0.4 GtCO2e in 2050. The range of 
projected CDR removals is very small through 2030 and increases to approximately -0.2 
GtCO2e between 2040 and 2050. 
 
 
4.1 Electricity 
The United States has set a goal for 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035, and this 
goal will provide an important foundation for the Long-Term Strategy of the United States. Elec-
tricity is used in every economic sector, and all 2050 net-zero pathways depend on rapidly de-
carbonizing electricity and expanding the use of this decarbonized electricity into as many uses 
as possible to displace polluting fuels. The electricity sector, which contributes about a quarter 
of all U.S. GHG emissions, has been reducing CO  emissions for years, with major shifts caused 
2
in part by increases in renewables and decreases in coal-fired generation (see Figure 5). Contin-
ued cost reductions in generation and storage are expected to enable even more rapid reduc-
tions of emissions from this sector. New policies, incentives, market reforms, and other actions 
will be needed to ensure that electricity sector emissions continue to decrease as total electric-
ity demand increases.  
 
The electricity sector will continue to evolve rapidly as it decarbonizes. Expected continued cost 
reductions in renewable generation as well as battery and other storage technologies could see 
emissions decreases of roughly 70-90% by 2030 on a path toward the 2035 100% clean electric-
ity goal. As shown in Figure 5, solar and wind generation continues to increase substantially 
through 2050, while existing nuclear generation remains in operation and could see growth in 
Page 36 
 the 2030s and 2040s. Unabated fossil generation (coal or gas generation without CCS technol-
ogy) declines, and existing fossil fueled plants start to be fitted with carbon capture. By 2050, 
clean generation provides zero-emission electricity to the rest of the economy, with all electric-
ity providing 15%-42% of primary energy.   
 
Recent analyses suggest that wholesale electricity prices, on average, are unlikely to change sig-
nificantly as we shift to a cleaner grid by 2030, with price impact estimates ranging from a 4% 
decrease to a 3% increase  [39]. Additionally, the transition to clean electricity is expected to re-
duce exposure of U.S. consumers to fuel supply shocks  [40].  
 
Figure 5: U.S. Electricity Generation 2005-2050. Generation by source in trillion kilo-
watt-hours. Total generation expands to 2050 due to increased use of clean electricity in 
new applications in transportation, industry, and buildings. Renewable generation in-
creases rapidly to keep pace with growing electricity demand and ensure that the share 
of renewables continues to expand to 2050. Note: Historical data are from EIA Monthly 
Energy Reviews, projections include data from all LTS scenarios using both GCAM and 
OP-NEMS, projections are shown in ten-year time steps. Projected fossil with CCS gener-
ation increases from 0 in 2020 to approximately 1-2 trillion kWh by 2050. Historical 
Page 37 
 fossil without CCS generation decreased from approximately 2.8 trillion kWh in 2005 to 
approximately 2.3 trillion kWh in 2020. Projected fossil without CCS generation de-
creases to 0 between 2040 and 2050. Historical nuclear generation remained roughly 
steady from 2005 to 2020 at approximately 0.8 trillion kWh. Projected nuclear genera-
tion will remain constant or increase up to approximately 1.5 trillion kWh by 2050. His-
torical renewables generation increased from approximately 0.3 trillion kWh in 2005 to 
approximately 0.8 trillion kWh in 2020. Projected renewables generation increases to 
between approximately 4.1 and 7.3 trillion kWh in 2050. Projected non-fossil combus-
tion increases from 0 in 2020 to approximately 0.1 trillion kWh in 2050. Historical bio-
mass with CCS and non-fossil combustion were zero in 2005-2020. Projected biomass 
with CCS and non-fossil combustion generation remains close to 0 in 2050. 
 
Investment in clean energy generation must continue through mid-century as overall electricity 
generation increases to meet demand growth from other sectors. Average annual total capacity 
additions without storage from 2021 to 2030 range from 58 gigawatts per year (GW/yr.) to 115 
GW/yr.; in 2031 to 2040 they range from 54 GW/yr. to 167 GW/yr.; and in 2041 to 2050 they 
range from 67 GW/yr. to 123 GW/yr. Storage capacity additions from 2021 to 2030 average 0.4 
GW/yr. to 2.7 GW/yr.; in 2031 to 2040, they range from 3 GW/yr. to 40 GW/yr.; and in 2041 to 
2050 they range from 11 GW/yr. to 64 GW/yr.  
 
This rapid evolution and scale of change in the electricity sector is ambitious, with high and sus-
tained deployment of new technologies through mid-century. Many significant challenges and 
barriers exist  [14] [22]. The electricity transition will require adding significant amounts of new 
zero-carbon electricity capacity at a sufficient pace to replace uncontrolled fossil fuel-fired gen-
eration while also providing ample clean supply for a growing economy with increased electrifi-
cation. New transmission, distribution, and storage infrastructure will be needed to maintain 
and improve grid reliability, including adapting the electric grid to be flexible to changing supply 
and demand over all increments of time. In particular, longer-duration storage solutions and 
appropriate incentive mechanisms will be critical. Absent new action, supply chains may be-
come stressed by limited availability of raw materials (such as rare earth elements), manufac-
turing capacity, and skilled workforce. Some pathways may also require significant expansion of 
carbon capture and storage technologies during the overall transition, which bring specific chal-
lenges around technology development and siting.  
 
These challenges are substantial but can be addressed through an integrated strategy of invest-
ment, innovation, and new technology deployment. Large-scale deployment of renewables can 
be accelerated by investments in grid infrastructure and advanced technologies. Grid infrastruc-
ture investments, including the buildout of new long-distance, high-voltage transmission 
Page 38 
 projects, can enhance resilience, improve reliability, better integrate variable generation re-
sources, lower electricity costs, and unlock the best clean energy resources by connecting them 
to demand centers. Significant deployment of energy efficiency can also help reduce the scale 
of investment required by lowering the total energy demand that must be met. Analyses show 
that as the sector becomes increasingly decarbonized, advanced technologies will be brought 
online to meet peak load and adjust to seasonal changes in demand. Advanced technologies—
which could include clean hydrogen combustion or fuel cells, enhanced geothermal systems, 
long-duration energy storage, advanced nuclear, and fossil generation with CCS—can provide 
clean firm resources that can balance increased variable generation. However, these technolo-
gies require a rapid, sustained acceleration in research, development, and deployment. The sig-
nificant investments in generation and transmission will underpin job growth across the nation, 
creating opportunities in cities and rural areas alike, particularly when paired with workforce 
training. Expansion of the transmission system, stronger interregional coordination, and distrib-
uted generation also provide resilience to natural disasters, saving lives and protecting busi-
nesses.  
 
Box 3: Rapid Decarbonization in the U.S. Electricity Sector is Underway 
The electricity sector in the United States has been decarbonizing rapidly, with significant in-
creases in renewable deployment in recent years. The shift to lower-emissions sources has 
been under way for decades, with early contributions from nuclear and then fossil gas. More 
recently, since around 2010, federal investment policies, tax credits, and regulatory actions, as 
well as state policies, research and development, and market trends, drove significant renewa-
ble deployment. At the same time, between 2010 and 2019, more than 546 coal-fired power 
units retired, totaling 102 GW of capacity, with another 17 GW of capacity planned for retire-
ment by 2025  [41]. This has led to a dramatic shift in the sources of U.S. electricity, with renew-
ables now accounting for more generation than coal (Figure 6). In addition, the sum of coal and 
natural gas generation has also declined in the last decade, pointing to the important role of re-
newable energy. 
Page 39 
  
Figure 6: Annual U.S. Electricity Generation from All Sectors 1950-2020 (trillion kilo-
watt-hours). The electricity sector has been rapidly decarbonizing since 2008. This figure 
shows electricity net generation in all sectors (electric power, industrial, commercial, 
and residential) and includes both utility-scale and small-scale solar. Rapid increases in 
solar, wind, and other renewable generation means that in 2020, for the first time, re-
newable generation surpassed coal generation. Coal generation has declined rapidly, re-
placed by natural gas and renewables. Source: EIA  [42]. Natural gas generation 
increased from 1950 to 2020, reaching 40% of generation in 2020 (approx. 1.5 trillion 
kWh). Renewables generation also increased at a slower rate than gas, reaching 21% of 
generation in 2020 (approx. 0.75 trillion kWh). Nuclear generation increased rapidly 
through 2000 and remained steady through 2020, reaching 20% of generation in 2020 
(approx. 0.75 trillion kWh). Coal generation grew steadily through 2000, making up the 
majority of electricity generation at its peak around 2008, then decreased rapidly 
through 2020, reaching 19% of generation in 2020 (approx. 0.75 trillion kWh). Other 
generation sources increased slightly through 1980, then declined, reaching <1% of gen-
eration in 2020 (approx. 0.05 trillion kWh). 
 
One of the challenges to reach the 2050 net-zero goal (as well as the 2035 100% clean electric-
ity goal) is the large amount of new zero-emission capacity (primarily renewables) that will 
need to be deployed annually to enable an increasingly large share of clean electricity genera-
tion. Figure 7 shows some indicative estimates of the magnitude of the annual capacity addi-
tions needed to remain on pace toward our goals, in comparison to recent historical levels of 
capacity additions. Recent trends in renewable deployment are encouraging. Solar and wind 
Page 40 
 capacity additions were about 32 GW in 2020, the highest on record, and are expected to be 
about 28 GW in 2021. Acceleration will be needed but the deployment rate has been growing 
quickly. 
 
 
 
Figure 7: Electric Generation Capacity Additions 2000-2050. Renewable capacity addi-
tions have been growing rapidly in the past decade (left) and are more closely approach-
ing levels that will be needed to sustain the overall decarbonization trend in electricity 
needed to reach the 2050 goal. A representative pathway (center) shows deployment of 
total zero-carbon technologies roughly on the order of 60–70 GW per year. Diverse sce-
narios in this analysis show a range of potential pathways to achieve net zero (right). 
Note: Historical data are from EIA Monthly Energy Reviews, projections include data 
from all LTS scenarios using GCAM. Other scenarios not shown in the figure have cumu-
lative nuclear capacity additions ranging up to 90–100 GW through 2050. Chart one: 
Electricity capacity additions between 2000 and 2020 primarily consist of fossil without 
CCS, wind, and solar generation. Fossil with CCS, nuclear, and other capacity additions 
were marginal. Wind capacity additions begin increasing starting around 2003; solar ca-
pacity additions began increasing starting around 2013. By 2020, solar contributed ap-
proximately two-fifths of new capacity, wind contributed approximately two-fifths, and 
fossil without CCS contributed approximately one-fifth. Chart two: A representative 
pathway to achieve net-zero by 2050 sees approximately 60 GW/yr. of annual new in-
stalled capacity from 2021 to 2040, which grows to approximately 70 GW/yr. of annual 
new installed capacity from 2041 to 2050. In the representative pathway, fossil with CCS 
contributes approximately 5 GW/yr. of annual new installed capacity, wind contributes 
Page 41 
 between approximately 30 GW/yr. of annual new installed capacity, with solar contrib-
uting the majority of the remaining capacity. Nuclear and other sources provide less 
than 5 GW/yr. of annual new installed capacity. Chart three: A range of pathways can be 
taken to achieve net-zero by 2050. Across these scenarios, the average annual new in-
stalled capacity between 2021 and 2050 varies from approximately 65 GW/yr. to ap-
proximately 75 GW/yr. Nuclear contributes approximately 5GW/yr. across scenarios. 
Wind additions range from approximately 25-30 GW/yr. Solar additions range from ap-
proximately 30-35 GW/yr. Nuclear and other sources provide less than 5 GW/yr. across 
scenarios. 
 
4.2 Transportation 
The transportation sector provides vital mobility services for people and goods with on-road ve-
hicles, planes, trains, ships, public transportation, and a wide variety of other modes. It is cur-
rently the highest emitting sector, representing 29% of all U.S. emissions [27]. To reduce 
emissions to net-zero by 2050 we will need to ensure that zero-emission vehicles dominate new 
sales for most types of vehicles by the early 2030s, as well as infrastructure to support alternate 
modes of transportation, such as trains, bikes, and public transit.  
 
The United States will continue to increase the use of electricity and sustainably produced low-
carbon fuels in the transportation sector while shifting away from fossil sources (Figure 8). Over 
time, electricity, carbon beneficial biofuels, and hydrogen will become increasingly clean. The 
availability and adoption of these low-carbon fuels in the coming decades will largely depend 
on the economics of production and/or procurement, the competitiveness of bioenergy and hy-
drogen compared to alternative low-carbon technologies across sectors, policy support, private 
investment and, in the case of bio-based energy, the ability to minimize potential negative land 
carbon outcomes and other environmental impacts of biomass production. Although demand 
for transportation services increases through mid-century, the total energy consumed in this 
sector declines due to a combination of regulations and technological advances which drive ef-
ficiency improvements and deliver societal and consumer benefits. 
Page 42 
  
Figure 8: U.S. Transportation Final Energy Use 2005-2050. Overall transportation en-
ergy in exajoules (EJ) decreases while the use of electricity and alternative fuels, includ-
ing biomass-derived fuels and hydrogen, increases to power nearly the full U.S. 
transport system by 2050. While light-duty vehicles are almost all electric by 2050 in 
most scenarios, there is uncertainty in other transportation sectors. Uncertainties in the 
future share of low-carbon bioenergy vs. hydrogen makes can affect the potential for 
electrification in the sector. These results show end use consumption instead of service 
demand (e.g., per mile travelled), so electricity demand appears smaller than alternative 
fuels demand due to the major inherent efficiency advantages of electric vehicles. Note: 
Historical data are from EIA Monthly Energy Reviews, projections include data from all 
LTS scenarios using both GCAM and OP-NEMS, projections are shown in ten-year time 
steps. Historical transportation energy use from fossil fuels decreased from approxi-
mately 30 exajoules in 2005 to approximately 24 exajoules in 2020. Projected 
Page 43 
 transportation energy use from fossil fuels decreases to approximately between 5 and 0 
exajoules in 2050. Historical transportation energy use from alternative fuels grew from 
near zero to approximately 2 exajoules in 2020. Projected transportation energy use 
from alternative fuels grows to approximately between 6 and 9 exajoules by 2050. His-
torical transportation energy use from electricity was near zero between 2005 and 
2020. Projected transportation energy use from electricity increases to approximately 
between 3 and 6 exajoules by 2050. 
 
A central component of the U.S. Long-Term Strategy in transportation is the expanded use of 
new transportation technologies—including a rapid expansion of zero-emission vehicles—in as 
many applications as possible across light-, medium-, and heavy-duty applications. Already, the 
growing popularity of electric vehicles (EVs), supported by incentives and continued advances in 
battery technology, is spurring greater EV adoption and industry goals for even higher EV sales. 
Other technologies can serve as important complements to EVs. The President’s goal and asso-
ciated policies to ensure half of all new vehicles sold in 2030 zero-emissions vehicles (including 
battery electric, plug-in hybrid electric, or fuel cell electric vehicles) will continue to spur growth 
across all zero-emission vehicle types. 
 
This rapid deployment of zero-emissions vehicles is ambitious and will need to occur at a large 
scale across all vehicle types. Many challenges and barriers exist  [14] [22] [25]. For example, 
costs for electric technologies, fueling, and charging infrastructure remain high in some applica-
tions. Some transportation segments, such as aviation, will likely remain difficult to electrify and 
some legacy vehicles will continue to be necessary in the near term, both of which would re-
quire alternate sources of low-carbon fuels that have yet to be deployed at the necessary scale. 
The existing built environment creates also high dependency on owner-occupied vehicles and 
presents numerous obstacles to alternate mobility options and shifting between modes such as 
transit, biking, or walking. 
 
An integrated strategy to address these substantial challenges can help accelerate the develop-
ment and rapid expansion of new transportation technologies. An expanded network of public 
transit options and infrastructure will increase urban mobility, helping to reduce emissions and 
increase equity in mobility. Electrifying segments of the rail system will decarbonize the existing 
rail system with the added benefit of enabling a more robust electric grid along railroad “right 
of way.” Additionally, “vehicle to grid” innovations may provide support for grid services. Accel-
erated research, development, demonstration, and deployment of lower-carbon fuels, such 
as clean hydrogen and sustainable biofuels, will contribute to the decarbonization of applica-
tions that may be more difficult to electrify including aviation and marine transportation and 
some medium- and heavy-duty trucking segments.

 4.3 Buildings  
Buildings house our population and provide a working environment for commercial sectors in-
cluding offices, colleges and K-12 schools, restaurants, grocery stores, and retail shops. Homes 
and commercial buildings are responsible for over one-third of CO  emissions from the U.S. en-
2
ergy system. Of this, roughly two-thirds of buildings sector emissions currently come from elec-
tricity, with the remainder coming from direct combustion of gas, oil, and other fuels for space 
heating, water heating, cooking, and other services, and buildings currently account for about 
three quarters of U.S. electricity sales  [43]. Electricity is used in buildings for lighting, space 
heating and cooling, water heating, electronics and appliances, and other services. CO  emis-
2
sions from buildings have been falling since 2005, due to increases in energy efficiency, the de-
carbonization of the electricity sector, and a modest trend towards the electrification of end 
uses. These emissions reductions have been achieved even as commercial building square foot-
age has increased by more than 25% and the population has grown by more than 10% since 
2005. All buildings need to be decarbonized with an emphasis on strategies that deliver for 
overburdened and underserved communities. For example, in the residential sector, house-
holds with an annual income below $60,000 account for nearly 50% of all household energy 
consumption, making it essential that efforts to decarbonize buildings are accessible to all 
households [44].  
 
The key driver of reducing building emissions is efficient use of electricity for end uses (such as 
heating, hot water, cooking, and others). Alongside the decarbonization of electricity, these 
changes can bring building sector emissions to near-zero by 2050. Across multiple possible 
pathways, building efficiency improvements also reduce the overall demand for energy by the 
sector, despite the substantial growth in the number of buildings, floorspace, and population 
expected through 2050 (Figure 9). Within this overall decrease in energy demand, the share of 
electricity in final energy demand grows as end uses are electrified, from about 50% in 2020 to 
90% or more by 2050 because the on-site combustion of gas, oil, and other fuels decreases sub-
stantially; however, the growth is also limited through energy efficiency and efficient electrifica-
tion. Heat pumps and other electric heaters and electric cooking account for more than 60% of 
sales by 2030 and nearly 100% of sales by 2050. Energy demand in buildings is reduced by 9% in 
2030 and 30% in 2050. 
Page 45 
  
Figure 9: U.S. Buildings Site Energy 2005-2050. Overall building site energy use in exa-
joules (EJ) decreases at the same time as certain applications (e.g., heating) switch from 
fossil fuels (and some biomass) to clean electricity. Note: Historical data are from EIA 
Monthly Energy Reviews, projections include data from all LTS scenarios using both 
GCAM and OP-NEMS. Historical building energy use from electricity increased from ap-
proximately 10 exajoules in 2005 to approximately 11 exajoules in 2020. Projected 
building energy use from electricity increases to between 11 and 14 exajoules in 2050. 
Historical building energy use from fossil fuels varied widely between 2005 and 2020, 
beginning at approximately 11 exajoules in 2005 and ending at approximately 10 exa-
joules in 2020, reaching a peak of approximately 11.5 exajoules around 2019. Projected 
building energy use from fossil fuels decreases to between 6 and 2 exajoules in 2050. 
 
While recent trends are encouraging, the building sector presents some unique challenges to 
rapid decarbonization. Foremost is the often-long lifetime of buildings. Many buildings built to-
day will still be in active use by 2050, which means that even immediate actions to improve 
new buildings take years before making a significant impact in the overall building stock. These 
factors affect all aspects of buildings including the outer shell; heating, ventilation, and air 
Page 46 
 conditioning systems; and appliances and lighting—although some of these are more amenable 
to retrofitting than others. In addition, energy efficiency and efficient electrification have barri-
ers relating to their upfront cost structure, financing, competing landlord and tenant incentives. 
These issues can be particularly difficult in underserved communities, which will also need 
widespread access to retrofits and new building technologies, though innovative financing tools 
such as inclusive investment programs can deliver substantial benefits to these communities 
while reducing or eliminating financing barriers and ensuring consumer protections.  
 
To address these challenges, pursuing multiple options effectively help achieve the necessary 
rapid emissions reductions in buildings while also reducing the energy cost burden for families 
and businesses and improving the health and resilience of communities. There are three im-
portant sources of emissions reductions: technological advances including from envelope im-
provements (e.g., attic and wall insulation, sealing leaks, and efficient windows), improved 
efficiency of electric end uses (e.g., lighting, refrigeration, appliances, and electronics), and the 
efficient electrification of space and water heating, cooking, and clothes drying in both existing 
and new buildings. The rapid deployment of heat pumps for space heating and cooling and wa-
ter heating is the central strategy for the efficient, flexible electrification of buildings. By in-
creasing the amount of demand-responsive heating, cooling, and water heating on the grid, 
these technologies can respond to shifts in renewable generation levels on short notice and re-
duce the overall cost of a low- or zero-carbon generation mix.  
 
Efficient and electrified buildings provide substantial consumer benefits. The most important 
benefit is reduced utility bills for households and businesses which are both direct (through 
lower energy usage) and indirect (through lower energy prices). More efficient buildings signifi-
cantly reduces electricity demand and lessen winter peaking loads as the sector electrifies, re-
ducing the cost of new generation, transmission, and distribution, which in turn reduces energy 
prices for American families and businesses. These bill savings would be most beneficial to low-
income households, which typically face the greatest energy burden. Buildings can also support 
electric vehicle charging infrastructure and rooftop solar installations, key elements of the 
broader energy transition. More efficient buildings also retain indoor temperature for longer 
during power outages under extreme weather conditions, improving health and safety. The role 
of state utility regulators will be especially important, as approval of new rate structures and 
consumer incentive programs will be vital in realizing the full potential of consumer benefits. 
Finally, building improvements will come from manufacturing, construction, and installation 
performed by skilled, well-paid American workers in communities across the country.

 4.4. Industry 
The U.S. industrial sector currently produces roughly 23% of U.S. GHG emissions and 30% of 
emissions from the energy system  [45]. It is heterogeneous, producing a wide range of prod-
ucts with diverse and sometimes specialized processes. The energy-intensive and emissions-in-
tensive industries include mining, steel manufacturing, cement production, and chemical 
production, and collectively produce nearly half of overall industrial emissions. In addition to 
the CO  emissions resulting from industrial demand for electricity, the industrial sector emits 
2
GHGs directly from many operations and processes including the use of fossil fuels for on-site 
energy use and as feedstocks, direct process emissions of CO  from cement production and 
2
other industries, and emission of non-CO  GHGs such as N O from nitric and adipic acid produc-
2 2
tion.  
 
Although there are many hard-to-decarbonize elements of industrial activities, investments in 
technologies for advanced non-carbon fuels, energy efficiency, and electrification can reduce 
overall industrial sector CO  emissions by 69-95% by 2050. A large range of potential pathways 
2
for the industrial sector are shown in Figure 10. Overall energy use drops in most scenarios 
through energy efficiency and materials efficiency investments. In these scenarios, overall elec-
tricity use in the sector grows only slightly due to electrification. However, in scenarios that rely 
on a large quantity of hydrogen, electricity use increases dramatically to produce the hydrogen 
through electrolysis. In all scenarios, low-carbon fuels (including electricity) grow as a percent-
age of total energy use. 
 
Page 48 
  
Figure 10: Industry Final Energy Use 2005-2050. Overall industrial energy use in exa-
joules (EJ) decreases to 2050 while certain applications switch from fossil fuels to clean 
electricity, hydrogen, or biofuels. Electricity use increases further in scenarios with 
larger hydrogen production due to the high electricity demand for that process. In this 
analysis, CCS in deployed in industry for process emissions, but there is limited repre-
sentation of CCS on industrial energy in the models we use. Accordingly, it is likely that a 
greater share of industrial fossil energy emissions could be captured by 2050 than is 
shown here. Note: Historical data are from EIA Monthly Energy Reviews, projections in-
clude data from all LTS scenarios using both GCAM and OP-NEMS, projections are shown 
in ten-year time steps. Historical industry energy use from fossil without CCS increased 
from approximately 20 exajoules in 2005 to approximately 21 exajoules in 2020. Pro-
jected industry energy use from fossil without CCS ranges from approximately 18 to 22 
exajoules in 2030, before declining steadily to reach between approximately 13 and 5 
exajoules in 2050. Historical industry energy use from electricity remained generally 
Page 49 
 steady from 2005 to 2020 at approximately 4 exajoules. Projected industry energy use 
from electricity grows to between approximately 5 and 20 exajoules in 2050. Historical 
industry energy use from fossil with CCS, biomass without CCS, biomass with CCS, and 
hydrogen were zero from 2005 to 2020. Projected industry energy use from fossil with 
CCS reaches approximately 2 to 4 exajoules by 2050. Projected industry energy use from 
biomass without CCS increases to approximately 2 to 10 exajoules by 2050. Projected 
industry energy use from biomass with CCS increases to approximately 4 exajoules by 
2050. Projected industry energy use from hydrogen increases to approximately 3 exa-
joules by 2050. 
 
Reducing energy-related GHG emissions from industry presents a set of unique challenges  [14] 
[22] [26]. A primary feature of this sector is that it is diverse: unlike electricity or buildings, for 
example, whose emissions come from a relatively small set of activities, industrial activities and 
infrastructure are designed around a large set of processes. Some of these processes might 
have relatively straightforward substitutes, but in other cases either those substitutes may not 
exist yet or might be higher cost. In some cases, alternate sources of process heating may need 
to be identified. In other cases, CCS applications may be needed, but these may be expensive or 
infeasible at existing production facilities. At the same time, scaling up of material efficiency 
could be challenging because of product design limitations or consumer demand. Many of 
these challenges also affect the non-CO  emissions from industry, which are discussed further 
2
Chapter 5.  
 
In response to these challenges, the industrial energy transition can be enabled to decarbonize 
at a sufficiently rapid pace through a diverse set of approaches tailored to the specific needs of 
each subsector. Key strategies include energy efficiency, material efficiency, electrification, 
adoption of low-carbon fuels and feedstocks, and CCS. Energy efficiency, waste heat recovery, 
and accelerated adoption of advanced technologies such as additive manufacturing, can signifi-
cantly reduce energy demand and lower costs to businesses. Material efficiency incorporates 
structural changes in manufacturing that include product recycling and reuse, material substitu-
tion, and demand reduction. Electrification of heated, fuel-consuming industrial processes and 
equipment is a viable pathway for some subsectors, such as light industry. Low-carbon fuels 
and feedstocks, including clean hydrogen and low-carbon biofuels, can reduce emissions from 
processes that are difficult to electrify. Finally, CCS can be used for emissions that are hard to 
abate through other means, particularly in the cement, chemicals, and iron and steel industries. 
Increased investments in research, development, demonstration, and deployment will advance 
technologies in production of iron and steel, cement, chemicals, and other industries, enabling 
these sectors to adopt low-carbon production.

 Chapter 5: Reducing Non-CO  Emissions Through 2050 
2
5.1 Introduction 
Non-CO  GHGs make up 20% of the U.S. contributions to global warming [27]. Non-CO  GHGs 
2 2
are highly potent heat trapping gases, many of which have greater near-term climate impacts 
than CO  [36]. As shown in Figure 11, three gases make up the majority of non-CO  GHG emis-
2 2
sions in the United States: methane (CH ), nitrous oxides (N O), and fluorinated gases (including 
4 2
HFCs)  [27]. The three sources that produce the largest proportion of emissions are soil man-
agement (i.e. agriculture and land use), livestock, and energy. While mitigation opportunities 
exist for many sources of non-CO  GHG emissions, costs and applicability vary. Because it is 
2
challenging to eliminate all of these sources, some remaining non-CO  emissions will need to be 
2
offset in 2050 by net-negative CO  emissions. 
2
 
 
Figure 11: Sources of U.S. Non-CO  GHG Emissions, 2019. Contribution to 2019 U.S. 
2
GHG emissions from non-CO  sources partitioned by type and sector. The contributions 
2
are shown in CO  equivalent, meaning that they are represented in proportion to their 
2
global warming contribution 100 years after emission. Approximately half of the global 
Page 51 
 warming contribution of non-CO  gases in 2019 came from methane, with nitrous oxide 
2
contributing the second most, followed by fluorinated gases. Methane contributed 51% 
of US non-CO2 GHG emissions in 2019. The sectors that contributed to methane emis-
sions are: energy (20% of US non-CO2 GHG emissions), livestock (19%), waste (10%), 
and other (1%). Fluorinated gases contributed 14% of US non-CO2 GHG emissions in 
2019. All of these fluorinated gas emissions came from industrial processes (14% of US 
non-CO2 GHG emissions). Nitrous oxide contributed 35% of US non-CO2 GHG emissions 
in 2019. The sectors that contributed to nitrous oxide emissions are: soil management 
(28% of US non-CO2 GHG emissions) and other (8%). 
 
This analysis estimates that the total technical potential for non-CO  GHG mitigation across all 
2
sectors is approximately 35% – without reducing the underlying activities  [36]. Reducing the 
use of fossil fuels through efficiency and fuel switching also has the potential to further drive 
down non-CO  GHG emissions by 19%, given the relationship between fugitive methane emis-
2
sions from the extraction, processing, and end-use of fossil fuels. These reflect multiple techno-
logical options that United States can use to achieve the necessary reductions in non-CO  GHG 
2
emissions to reach net-zero total emissions by 2050 (Figure 12). Under these scenario assump-
tions, there remain non-CO  GHG emissions in the 2030 and 2050 timeframes, which must be 
2
offset by carbon dioxide removal.  
 
Reductions in non-CO  emissions face several challenges. First is an underdeveloped set of miti-
2
gation strategies in certain subsectors. In part because of a lack of historical focus on non-CO  
2
reductions, the set of available mitigation approaches for these gases is still relatively small and, 
in many cases, in earlier stages of technological development. This means that through 2050, 
overall non-CO  emissions can be held roughly constant by deploying currently available mitiga-
2
tion technologies. Achieving long-term reductions of non-CO  emissions below current levels 
2
requires development of new or more-effective mitigation technologies and approaches. In ad-
dition, in a way that is similar to the industrial energy emissions described in Chapter 4, the 
sources of non-CO emissions are diverse. This means that individual strategies must be devel-
2 
oped for each sub-sector and gas.  
 
In light of these challenges, this LTS analysis of non-CO  GHG mitigation potential assumes only 
2
modest technological and cost improvements over time. Because these assumptions may be 
conservative, additional, lower-cost, and more rapid reductions could be realized, and this will 
remain an area of active inquiry. Achieving more significant long-term reductions of non-CO  
2
GHG emissions will require major technological advances and new, or more effective, backstop 
mitigation options. In sectors with less developed current approaches, this could include new 
research and development into identifying and commercializing new technologies to reduce 
Page 52 
 non-CO  emissions. In other sectors, new mitigation options are under development and near-
2
ing commercialization that could result in large volumes of non-CO  mitigation and further re-
2
duce non-CO  emissions (see Box 4).   
2
 
Figure 12: Pathways for Non-CO  Reductions from 2020 to 2050. This figure shows the 
2
range of pathways available for non-CO  mitigation from today to 2050 across all mod-
2
eled scenarios. In all scenarios there is significant reduction from the 2020 reference, 
highlighting the importance of non-CO  abatement. Historical methane emissions de-
2
creased from approximately 700 MtCO2e in 2005 to approximately 640 MtCO2e in 
2020. Projected methane emissions decrease to approximately 430 MtCO2e in 2050. 
Historical nitrous oxide emissions remained roughly steady from 2005 to 2020 at ap-
proximately 450 MtCO2e. Projected nitrous oxide emissions range from approximately 
300 to 400 MtCO2e in 2050. Historical fluorinated gas emissions increased from approxi-
mately 150 MtCO2e in 2005 to approximately 200 MtCO2e in 2020. Projected fluori-
nated gas emissions decrease to approximately 75 MtCO2e in 2050. 
 
Page 53 
 5.2 Key Abatement Opportunities 
Potential reductions in non-CO  gases can come from a diverse set of actions, and these actions 
2
together aggregate to significant levels (Figure 13). Technical potential includes technologies 
like anaerobic digestion of manure in the agricultural sector and leakage detection and mitiga-
tion in the oil and gas sector. As discussed above, some portion of each non-CO  gas, such as 
2
some of the methane and N O from the agriculture sector, cannot be abated in the 2050 
2
timeframe, even after applying all available mitigation technologies, and will have to be offset 
by negative CO  emissions.  
2
 
 
Figure 13: Non-CO  Mitigation Technical Potential by Gas (MtCO e) in 2050. This figure 
2 2
shows potential reductions in 2050 from non-CO  emissions in methane, nitrous oxide, 
2
and fluorinated GHGs. It is constructed from abatement cost curves using technologies 
like anaerobic digestion of manure in the agricultural sector and leakage detection and 
mitigation in the oil and gas sector. Some abatement technologies are negative cost and 
many cost less than $100 per metric ton of CO e. Technical abatement potential is most 
2
significant for methane and fluorinated gases. For methane emissions in 2050, approxi-
mately 250 MtCO2e can be abated at <$100/tCO2e, approximately 50 MtCO2e can be 
Page 54 
 abated at >$100/tCO2e, leaving approximately 420 MtCO2e in remaining emissions. For 
nitrous oxide emissions in 2050, approximately 50 MtCO2e can be abated at 
<$100/tCO2e, with a marginal amount abated at >$100/tCO2e, leaving approximately 
420 MtCO2e in remaining emissions. For fluorinated gases in 2050, approximately 150 
MtCO2e can be abated at <$100/tCO2e, with a marginal amount abated at 
>$100/tCO2e, leaving approximately 75 MtCO2e in remaining emissions. 
5.2.1 Methane 
Methane is a potent GHG and accounts for about half of the current observed warming5 of 
1.0°C, according to the latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  [1]. 
Methane is primarily generated by fossil fuel energy operations (oil, gas, and coal), waste oper-
ations, and livestock and agricultural operations. There are cost-effective methane abatement 
options across all these sectors  [36]. Figure 14 shows 2050 methane abatement potential by 
source.  
 
 
5 Greenhouse gas emissions in total have contributed 150% of the observed warming of 1.0⁰C, but emissions of 
cooling aerosols have counteracted some of that warming. 
Page 55 
  
Figure 14: 2050 Methane Abatement Potential in the United States. This figure shows 
sources of methane abatement potential in 2030 in the United States  [36]. This mar-
ginal abatement cost curve indicates the price at which methane mitigation from vari-
ous sources of methane are cost-effective. This figure does not include additional 
abatement that can be achieved by reducing the underlying activities that drive emis-
sions. These additional reductions from activity driver changes are included in the GCAM 
modeling and reflected in Figure 12. Approximately 100 MtCO2e in methane emissions 
can be abated at negative cost, primarily from oil and natural gas sources, but also with 
some contributions from coal mining, landfills, and livestock. Approximately an addi-
tional 125 MtCO2e can be abated at ~$50/tCO2e or less, primarily from oil and natural 
gas and livestock sources. Approximately an additional 50 MtCO2e can be abated at 
~$100/tCO2e or less, from livestock and oil and natural gas sources. A remaining ap-
proximately 50 MtCO2e can only be abated at prices ~$150/tCO2e or higher. 
 
Methane mitigation opportunities by sector include: 
•  Energy Sector Methane. Energy sector fugitive methane emissions result from opera-
tions in the oil and natural gas sector and the coal mining sector. In some cases, a large 
proportion of oil and gas methane emissions come from a small number of sources. Me-
thane mitigation measures in oil and natural gas typically fall into three categories: 
equipment modifications or upgrades; changes in operational practices, including di-
rected inspection, repair and maintenance (DI&M); and installation of new equipment  
[35]. Abatement measures are available to mitigate emissions associated with a variety 
of system components, including compressors, engines, dehydrators, pneumatic con-
trols, pipelines, storage tanks, wells, and others. Commercially-available mitigation tech-
nologies can also recover and reduce CH  emissions from coal mining operations. These 
4
reduction technologies consist of one or more of the following primary components: a 
drainage and recovery system to remove CH  from the underground coal seam, an end 
4
use application for the gas recovered from the drainage system, and/or a ventilation air 
methane (VAM) recovery or mitigation system  [35]. The CH mitigation potential from 
4 
the energy sector at $100/tCO e is 144 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent 
2
(MtCO e), or approximately 43% of 2030 energy sector non-CO  GHG emissions, and re-
2 2
mains an important source of potential mitigation through 2050.  
•  Waste Methane. Landfills produce CH  and other landfill gases through the natural pro-
4
cess of bacterial decomposition of organic waste under anaerobic conditions. Landfill 
gases are generated over a period of several decades, with flows usually beginning 
within 2 years of disposal. Abatement options to control landfill emissions are grouped 
into three categories: (1) collection and flaring, (2) landfill gas (LFG) utilization systems, 
Page 56 
 and (3) enhanced waste diversion practices (e.g., recycling and reuse programs) [35]. 
Within the waste category, wastewater treatment is the second most important source 
of non-CO  GHGs. Methane emissions in wastewater treatment could be significantly 
2
reduced by 2050 through currently available mitigation options, such as anaerobic bio-
mass digesters and centralized wastewater treatment facilities. Improved operational 
practices, such as controlling dissolved oxygen levels during treatment or limiting oper-
ating system upsets, can also help reduce N O emissions from wastewater treatment  
2
[35]. The CH mitigation potential from the waste sector non-CO  GHG at $100/t is 8 
4  2
MtCO e, or 6% of total 2030 waste sector emissions, and remains an important source 
2
of potential mitigation through 2050.  
• Livestock Methane. Emissions from livestock include enteric fermentation and manure 
management. Enteric fermentation is a normal mammalian digestive process, where gut 
microbes produce CH . Livestock manure management produces CH  emissions during 
4 4
the anaerobic decomposition of manure and N O emissions during the nitrification and 
2
denitrification of the organic nitrogen content in livestock manure and urine  [35]. With-
out altering underlying demand, the mitigation potential of livestock methane at $100/t 
is 70 MtCO e, or 27% of 2030 livestock non-CO  GHG emissions, and remains an im-
2 2
portant source of potential mitigation through 2050.
• Cropland and Rice Production Methane. The anaerobic decomposition of organic mat-
ter (i.e., decomposition in the absence of free oxygen) in flooded rice fields produces 
CH . GHG mitigation scenarios include several factors that influence the amount of CH
4 4 
produced and carbon sequestration in soils, including water management practices and 
the quantity of organic material available to decompose  [35]. The mitigation potential 
from the agriculture sector at $100/t is 1.7 MtCO e, or 1% of 2030 agricultural CH  emis-
2 4
sions [36].
Box 4: Global Methane Pledge 
In September 2021 at the Major Economies Forum, the United States and European Union 
jointly announced the Global Methane Pledge. As of October 2021, over 30 supportive coun-
tries, representing well over 30% of global methane emissions and 60% of global GDP, had al-
ready joined—with many more expected. Countries joining the Global Methane Pledge commit 
to a collective goal of reducing global methane emissions by at least 30% from 2020 levels by 
2030. They also commit to moving towards using highest-tier inventory methodologies to quan-
tify methane emissions, with a particular focus on high emission sources.  
Delivering on the Pledge would reduce warming by at least 0.2°C by 2050. In addition, it would 
prevent over 200,000 premature deaths, hundreds of thousands of asthma-related emergency 
Page 57 room visits, and over 20 million tons of crop losses a year by 2030 by reducing ground-level 
ozone pollution caused in part by methane. 
 
The United States is pursuing significant methane reductions on multiple fronts. The Long-Term 
Strategy analysis shows that the United States can do its part to meet the global goal of the 
Global Methane Pledge by reducing domestic methane emissions by over 30% below 2020 by 
2030. This level of reduction would avoid 11,000 premature deaths, 1,600 asthma-related 
emergency room visits, and 4.1 million tons of agricultural losses per year in the United States. 
 
5.2.2 Nitrous Oxide 
Nitrous oxide (N O) is a potent GHG with 298 times more warming potential than carbon diox-
2
ide and a long atmospheric lifetime (approximately 114 years). N O comes from natural and an-
2
thropogenic sources and is removed from the atmosphere mainly by photolysis (i.e., 
breakdown by sunlight) in the stratosphere. In the United States, the main anthropogenic 
sources of N O are agricultural soil management, livestock waste management, mobile and sta-
2
tionary fossil fuel combustion, adipic acid production, and nitric acid production. N O is also 
2
produced naturally from a variety of biological sources in soil and water, although this report 
only covers man-made sources. Figure 15 shows 2050 nitrous oxide abatement potential by 
source. 
Page 58 
  
Figure 15: 2050 Nitrous Oxide Abatement Potential in the United States. This figure 
shows sources of nitrous oxide abatement potential in 2050 in the United States. This 
marginal abatement cost curve indicates the price at which nitrous oxide mitigation 
from various sources of are cost-effective. This figure does not include abatement asso-
ciated with a reduction of the underlying activities that drive emissions. These additional 
reductions from activity driver changes are included in the GCAM modeling and re-
flected in Figure 11. Approximately 1-2 MtCO2e in N2O emissions can be abated at neg-
ative cost, primarily from croplands. Approximately an additional 40 MtCO2e can be 
abated at ~$25/tCO2e or less, primarily from nitric adipic sources. An additional approxi-
mately 10 MtCO2e can be abated only at >$100/tCO2e, including from livestock and 
croplands sources.   
 
Nitrous oxide mitigation opportunities by sector include:  
•  Agricultural Nitrous Oxide. Agriculture is the source of over 82% of nitrous oxide emis-
sions. Most N O is produced in soils by bacteria through the processes of nitrification 
2
and denitrification which occur with fertilizer application. It is also emitted in lesser 
Page 59 
 amounts from livestock waste, rice production, and soil management such as draining, 
irrigation, and land use change. Nitrous oxide emissions can be mitigated by changing 
fertilizer management practices to increase the efficiency of plant uptake of nitrogen  
[35]. Practices include precision agriculture, using nitrification inhibitors, and splitting 
annual applications into seasonal applications. The mitigation potential from the agricul-
ture sector at $100/t is 8.8 MtCO e, which is 2.5% of 2030 nitrous oxide emissions from 
2
agriculture  [36] and remains a small source of mitigation through 2050. 
•  Nitric and Adipic Acid Production. Nitric acid is an inorganic compound used primarily 
to make synthetic commercial fertilizer. Adipic acid is a white crystalline solid used as a 
feedstock in the manufacture of synthetic fibers, coatings, plastics, urethane foams, 
elastomers, and synthetic lubricants. The production of these acids results in nitrous ox-
ide emissions as a by-product. By 2030, about two-thirds of nitrous oxide emissions 
from this source category are projected to be from adipic acid production driven by high 
demand growth compared with about one-third from nitric acid production. Abatement 
measures applicable to nitric acid are characterized by the point in the production pro-
cess they are implemented, but generally involve catalytic decomposition of the nitrous 
oxide by-products  [35]. Thermal destruction is the abatement option applied to the 
adipic acid production process. The mitigation potential from nitric and adipic acid pro-
duction at $100/t is 17.7 MtCO e, or 62% of total sectoral 2030 nitrous oxide emissions  
2
[36] and remains an important source of mitigation through 2050.  
 
5.2.3 Fluorinated Gases 
Fluorinated gases (F-GHGs) are anthropogenically-generated and used in a range of applica-
tions. Sometimes referred to as “climate superpollutants,” they are highly potent GHGs, capa-
ble of trapping hundreds to thousands of times more heat per molecule than carbon dioxide. 
According to the 2021 Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks  [27], most fluori-
nated gases emitted are hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). A substitute for ozone-depleting sub-
stances, HFCs were initially developed to replace ozone-depleting substances (ODS) in 
refrigeration, air conditioning, aerosols, fire suppression, and as foam blowing agents. HFC 
emissions reductions are achievable by preventing or reducing leaks and transitioning to the 
use of alternatives with low global warming potential (GWP). Figure 16 shows 2050 fluorinated 
GHG abatement potential by source. 
Page 60 
  
Figure 16: 2050 Fluorinated GHG Abatement Potential in the United States: This figure 
shows sources of fluorinated GHG abatement potential in 2050 in the United States. 
This marginal abatement cost curve indicates the price at which F-GHG mitigation from 
sources of are cost-effective. This figure does not include additional abatement that can 
be achieved by reducing the underlying activities that drive emissions. These additional 
reductions from activity driver changes are included in the GCAM modeling and re-
flected in Figure 11. Approximately 70 MtCO2e in F-gas emissions reductions can be ac-
complished at negative cost, primarily from refrigeration and AC or aerosols. 
Approximately a further 70 MtCO2e from refrigeration and AC can be accomplished at 
less than $10/tCO2e. Approximately an additional 15 MtCO2e can be accomplished at 
less than $35/tCO2e, including from aerosols, refrigeration and AC, and semiconductors. 
Approximately an additional 5 MtCO2e can only be accomplished at ~$100/tCO2e or 
higher, including from aluminum and aerosols. 
 
Under the American Innovation and Manufacturing (AIM) Act of 2020, in September 2021 the 
EPA finalized a rule that phases down HFCs through an allowance allocation and trading 
Page 61 
 program. The AIM Act, along with this rule, provides the domestic legal framework to imple-
ment the phasedown of HFCs outlined in the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, 
which 124 countries have joined to date. The phasedown will effectively decrease the produc-
tion and import of HFCs in the United States by 85% by 2036 on the same step-down schedule 
as laid out in the Kigali Amendment and is expected to result in reductions of more than 4.5 bil-
lion metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent by 2050.  
 
Achieving significant HFC reductions by 2050 will rely on a three-pronged approach. First, phase 
down the production and import of HFCs. Second, address the existing stock of refrigerators 
and air conditioners, which already contain HFCs and have potential to leak into the atmos-
phere over the coming decades. Third, deploy the next generation of low-GWP alternatives to 
existing HFCs. Additional RD&D support to ensure new alternatives to HFCs continue to enter 
the market may also be important, including both new molecules and new uses for existing al-
ternatives. Combining these approaches, the mitigation potential of HFCs at less than $100/t is 
84 MtCO e, which is 39% of total 2030 sectoral emissions, and remains an important source of 
2
mitigation through 2050.  
 
5.2.4 Black Carbon  
Black carbon (soot) is not a GHG, but a powerful climate-warming aerosol [1] that is a compo-
nent of fine particulate matter (PM ) that enters the atmosphere through the incomplete 
2.5
combustion of fossil fuels, biofuels, and biomass [46]. The Arctic is particularly vulnerable to 
warming from black carbon. Black carbon is also a local air pollutant, contributing to major 
health impacts that disproportionately affect low-income and marginalized communities  [47]. 
Transitioning from fossil fuel combustion for electricity and transport (on-road and off-road) to 
cleaner alternatives is key to reducing black carbon emissions in the United States. Flaring in 
the oil and gas sector is an additional source of black carbon. The EPA estimates that U.S. black 
carbon emissions have been reduced significantly since 2013 primarily due to reductions in the 
road and off-road transport sectors, largely through policies and strategies to reduce the emis-
sions from mobile diesel engines. Strengthening particulate matter standards and addressing 
legacy diesel vehicles and emissions associated with ports, including from ships, port equip-
ment, and trucks, would further contribute to meeting national climate, health, and climate jus-
tice goals.  
 
Box 5: Non-CO Breakthrough Technologies: Reducing Methane from Enteric Fer-
2
mentation 
While many low-cost abatement opportunities exist today for non-CO  emissions—and are re-
2
flected in this analysis—some specific applications do not have current, low-cost mitigation op-
portunities. A renewed focus on research and development for these remaining non-CO  
2
Page 62 
 emission processes could potentially provide significant benefits as well as dramatically lower 
the costs of reductions. While not required to achieve our 2050 net-zero goal, such advances 
could provide valuable additional flexibility in how that goal could be achieved.  
 
One example of this kind of positive breakthrough may be emerging. Without a technological 
advance, there is limited methane abatement potential from enteric sources—cattle, sheep, 
and goats—which produce methane as part of their digestive process. While improving produc-
tivity can, to a limited extent, help reduce methane emissions per pound of beef or gallon of 
milk, it does not provide a route to major reductions. However, recent research suggests that 
new technologies might be able to offer greatly increased effectiveness. New discoveries of 
low-cost feed additives indicate the possibility that these would unlock large additional poten-
tial emissions reductions. Examples of these additives include red algae (Asparagopsis) and a 
compound, 3-Nitrooxypropanol (3-NOP). 
 
EPA and other researchers are collecting information to assess these technologies. As-
paragopsis, 3-NOP, and other technologies may increase non-CO  GHG mitigation. The science 
2
and economics of Asparagopsis is far from settled, with important remaining questions sur-
rounding the costs to grow, harvest, and process Asparagopsis into feed; to assess scalability to 
produce marketable quantities (or directly synthesize bromoform); and to assess the long-term 
tolerance of cattle and the applicability to different production and regulatory systems. If na-
tional-scale developments prove technically and economically feasible, Asparagopsis could po-
tentially decrease livestock emissions by as much as 160 MtCO e (60%) in 2030. 3-NOP has 
2
shown strong potential for methane reduction across multiple trials, with over 45 peer-re-
viewed papers examining numerous aspects of the potential impacts of this additive. 3-NOP has 
been shown to be effective in reducing enteric emissions by about one-third in dairy cows and 
up to 70% in beef finishing trials without unacceptable side-effects. More innovation and test-
ing are needed to further develop these solutions and bring them to market.

 Chapter 6: Removing Carbon Through 2050 and Beyond 
6.1 The Necessity of CO  Removal to Reach Net-Zero 
2
Efficiency, electrification of end uses, decarbonization of the electricity sector, and reduction in 
non-CO  emissions are the most important levers for decarbonizing the U.S. economy and will 
2
be the emphasis of the overall strategy to reach net-zero by 2050. However, as mentioned in 
previous sections, some activities will be difficult to decarbonize completely by 2050. Because 
of this, removals of CO  from the atmosphere will be critical to enable the United States to 
2
reach net-zero by 2050 and achieve net negative emissions thereafter. This implies an im-
portant role for the land sector, which can increase natural carbon dioxide removal and storage 
from the atmosphere, as well as a role for technologies including advanced carbon dioxide re-
moval (CDR) technologies. Carbon dioxide removal technologies will only deliver desired socie-
tal and environmental benefits if their deployment is well-designed and well-governed. Figure 
17 shows the range of outcomes for mitigation pathways as well as removals pathways to 
achieve net-zero by 2050. 
 
Figure 17: Balancing Emissions Reductions and Removals to Reach 2050 Net-Zero. This 
figure shows the range of outcomes for mitigation pathways as well as removals 
Page 64 
 pathways to achieve net-zero by 2050. Some sources of non-CO  emissions, and poten-
2
tially some CO  emissions, cannot be reduced to zero, and these must be balanced by 
2
CO  removals. CO  removals can happen through land sinks, such as forest growth and 
2 2
soil carbon sequestration, or through carbon dioxide removal technologies such as di-
rect air capture or carbon capture and sequestration in industry or electricity genera-
tion. Note: Historical data in this figure are from the U.S. GHG Inventory (2021). 
Historical CO2 emissions decreased from approximately 6.25 GtCO2e in 2005 to approxi-
mately 5.1 GtCO2e in 2020. Projected CO2 emissions decrease to roughly 1 GtCO2e in 
2050. Historical non-CO2 emissions remained roughly steady at approximately 1.25 
GtCO2e from 2005 to 2020. Projected non-CO2 emissions decrease to roughly 1 GtCO2e 
in 2050. Historical land sink removals remained roughly steady at approximately -0.8 
GtCO2e from 2005 to 2020. Projected land sink removals range from approximately -0.7 
GtCO2e to -1.25 GtCO2e in 2050. Historical CDR removals were zero from 2005 to 2020. 
Projected CDR removals increase to approximately -0.25 GtCO2e in 2040 and approxi-
mately -0.5 GtCO2e in 2050. Overall, historical net GHG emissions decreased from ap-
proximately 6.5 GtCO2e in 2005 to approximately 5.8 GtCO2e in 2020. Projected net 
GHG emissions fall to approximately 2.7 GtCO2e by 2030 and 0 by 2050. 
 
6.2 Maintaining and Enhancing CO  Removal through the U.S. Land Car-
2
bon Sink  
U.S. lands provide myriad social, economic, and environmental benefits. The United States has 
8% of the world’s forests (310 million ha) and 8% of global agricultural lands (400 million ha) 
[48]. These lands provide essential ecological, economic, and non-monetary social services, and 
will also be critical in supporting economy-wide decarbonization over the next 30 years and be-
yond.  
 
Our lands, and human activities on those lands, emit CO  to the atmosphere through land con-
2
version, soil degradation, and forest loss and degradation, but also remove it via photosynthesis 
and store it as carbon in trees, other vegetation, soils, and products. For the last several dec-
ades, U.S. lands have been a net carbon sink, meaning more CO  is sequestered than emitted 
2
annually from the land sector. This historic trend was due in part to millions of acres shifting 
into forest from other uses and the conservation and continued regrowth of trees on already 
forested lands, much of which had been deforested before the early 1900s [49]. Today’s forest 
sink is still increasing but at a decreasing rate  [27]. In 2019, the U.S. land carbon sink yielded 
net CO  removals of 813 MtCO e, offsetting approximately 12.4% of economy-wide GHG emis-
2 2
sions  [27]. 
 
Page 65 
 Though the overall U.S. lands net carbon sink has been relatively stable for recent decades, the 
future of that sink is uncertain [50], and several challenges exist to bolstering it and expanding 
it significantly. Substantial forested lands, including large portions of our Western public lands, 
now have older forests which sequester less CO  and are more vulnerable to natural disturb-
2
ances  [51].  Moreover, increased levels of disturbances—fires, insects, diseases, droughts, and 
storms—are expected in the future, along with other potential ecosystem changes such as CO  
2
fertilization, due to climate change.  These changing environmental conditions will also dictate 
the future degree of mitigation and adaptation capabilities and opportunities  [52]. These fac-
tors are already having an impact: total carbon removal in the land use, land use change, and 
forestry (LULUCF) sector has decreased by approximately 11% since 1990  [27]. In addition, U.S. 
lands include diverse ecosystems which complicates efforts at comprehensive and timely data 
collection, as well as monitoring and verification of baseline emissions, sequestration, and GHG 
outcomes of mitigation activities. In addition, the land base is finite in terms of its ability to con-
tinue to provide food, fiber, and essential ecosystem and biodiversity services while also sup-
porting potentially increased levels of carbon-beneficial biomass for energy production and 
carbon removal strategies through bioenergy and CCS. In addition, CO  removals via natural sys-
2
tems can be more variable than those in other sectors or technologies, as they are subject to 
reversals, e.g., from natural disturbances like fires, storms, and pests or from individual land-
owners changing land management practices. Also, with respect to policies, U.S. lands are held 
and managed for different objectives by a range of different stakeholders that operate under 
different legal, social, and environmental norms. Achieving land sector goals necessitates coor-
dination and cooperation with millions of private landowners, private sector corporations, and 
non-governmental organizations, as well as Tribal, local, state, and federal government agen-
cies.   
 
These challenges may be counterbalanced, at least in part, by changes in the economy, policy 
actions, and investments. Achieving significant land carbon benefits by 2050 and beyond re-
quires targeted, science-based action in the near term and over the next several decades. These 
actions must not only work to enhance our land carbon sink but also ensure our lands continue 
to provide a host of other benefits, including provision of goods, jobs, ecosystem services, rec-
reational and spiritual spaces, and biodiversity preservation. For example, public and private 
investments in natural climate solutions (e.g., augmented federal programs, private entities’ in-
volvement in land conservation, and offset markets) can increase acreage, productivity, and 
overall health of U.S. forested lands [52] [54]. Strengthening existing and supporting new 
emerging timber markets, especially in the fast-growing climes of Southeast United States, can 
also help maintain and expand forested lands  [55]. Policies, incentives, and investments that 
can support an enhanced sink through activities such as reforestation and soil carbon retention 
will be central. Low- or zero-carbon biomass for bioenergy and BECCS applications can also 
Page 66 
 contribute to emissions reductions. These policies and programs must include safeguards to 
minimize issues such as potential reversals and leakage to the extent possible, and include ef-
forts to bolster our ability to monitor, track, and verify emissions reductions at different scales.  
 
Specific areas of focus include: 
•  Forests. GHG benefits in the relative near term can come from activities such as avoided 
forest land conversion to other uses. Some forest sector actions, such as longer harvest 
rotations or increased carbon storage in harvested wood products and substitution of 
more fossil-intensive construction materials with wood products, can yield both near- 
and long-term benefits  [56]. There are considerable opportunities for reforestation in 
the United States  [57], potentially up to 133 million acres  [58]. Other activities like af-
forestation, improved forest management, and reduced natural disturbances (e.g., 
avoided forest fires via fuel treatments such as thinning and prescribed fires) can offer 
incremental near-term net carbon benefits and may yield substantial benefits in the 
long term [59]. 
•  Agricultural Lands. There are potential substantial GHG mitigation and increased re-
moval opportunities on U.S. croplands and grasslands via activities that conserve and/or 
increase soil carbon and employ innovative lands management approaches such as ag-
roforestry, rotational grazing, reduced tillage, residue management, and more.  
•  Bioenergy. Biomass is a key component of efforts to decarbonize the energy sector, as 
studies have shown that higher levels of biomass availability and use can offer lower-
cost mitigation than decarbonization strategies without biomass (e.g., [60] 
[61]). Bioenergy can be particularly useful in deep decarbonization scenarios, as it can 
be used to decarbonize energy use in multiple sectors through a range of different en-
ergy pathways (e.g., liquid fuel, biogas, electricity, and hydrogen production), and it can 
be used in combination with CCS to further reduce GHG emissions  [9]. Efforts aimed at 
employing biomass use for energy should include safeguards to ensure actual emissions 
reductions to the atmosphere and reflect consideration of the many non-carbon conse-
quences of large-scale biomass production and use (e.g., competition with food produc-
tion and biodiversity and broader ecosystem impacts).  
 
6.3 Assessing Potential Land Sector Pathways 
The LTS pathways explored for this study include varying degrees of private and public invest-
ment in natural climate solutions in both forestry and agriculture, such as improved forest man-
agement, fire reduction activities, afforestation, and improved agricultural soil management. To 
better reflect the uncertainties associated with estimating the complex carbon dynamics of dif-
ferent terrestrial ecosystems and related market interactions, and the potential extent of land 
use change between sectors, the U.S. LULUCF projections through 2050 are presented as a 
Page 67 
 range, as seen in Figure 18. This range was developed via a collaborative multi-agency effort us-
ing different models reflecting alternate modeling techniques. The analysis is based on several 
sectoral lands models including the Global Timber Model (GTM), the Forestry and Agriculture 
Sectoral Optimization Model with Greenhouse Gases (FASOM-GHG), three U.S. Forest Service 
models (the Resources Planning Act (RPA) Forest Dynamics model, the RPA Land Use Change 
model, and the Forest Resource Outlook model), and USDA agricultural soil carbon projections, 
to provide a range of potential land sink projections in 2050. As shown in Figure 18, there is a 
significant range of possible land sector pathways which could enable the United States to meet 
its net-zero goal by 2050.  
 
Figure 18: Land Use, Land Use Change, and Forestry CO  Business as Usual and LTS Ac-
2
tion Projections with Uncertainty Ranges. There is a range of possible CO  outcomes for 
2
both the reference case and the Long-Term Strategy action case. Historic values are 
from the U.S. GHG Inventory  [27] and projected values are derived from a range of land 
sector models. Estimates include forest ecosystem carbon pools, harvested wood prod-
ucts carbon storage, and land use and land use conversion fluxes across land types. His-
torical LULUCF removals remain generally steady at approximately -750 MtCO2e from 
2005 to 2020. BAU LULUCF removals by 2050 range from approximately -500 MtCO2e to 
Page 68 
 -1,050 MtCO2e. NCS Action Range LULUCF removals by 2050 range from approximately 
-600 MtCO2e to -1,300 MtCO2e. 
 
6.4 CO2 Removal Through Engineered Approaches 
In addition to the land sector CO  reduction potential, technological CO  removal options could 
2 2
be deployed over coming decades to support the net-zero emissions goal. While some technol-
ogies for such activities do exist, advanced CDR technologies are today in various stages of de-
velopment.  
 
At this early stage, it is difficult to estimate exactly which combinations of technologies might 
be most achievable and appropriate in terms of deployment, but potential strategies include: 
•  Biomass carbon removal and storage. This is a carbon dioxide removal approach where 
CO  is produced from the combustion, gasification, or other conversion of low- or zero-
2
carbon biomass, for example to generate electricity or produce hydrogen, and the re-
sulting CO  emissions are captured and then stored in a manner that prevents it from 
2
reentering the atmosphere. Specifically, the captured CO  emissions are compressed 
2
into a fluid and transported to a specified site, where they are injected into deep, under-
ground geological formations, such as former oil and gas reservoirs or deep saline for-
mations for long-term storage. CDR efforts using biomass as an input, such as biomass 
use for energy with CCS, should include safeguards to ensure actual emissions reduc-
tions to the atmosphere (e.g., including, to the extent possible, robust GHG accounting), 
and reflect consideration of the many non-carbon consequences of large-scale biomass 
production and use (e.g., competition with food production and biodiversity and 
broader ecosystem impacts)  [61]. 
•  Direct Air Capture and Storage (DACS). This is a technology that captures CO  emissions 
2
directly from ambient air (instead of from point sources, such as power plants or indus-
trial facilities), via solvent, solid sorbent, or mineral processes. The captured CO  is then 
2
either compressed and sequestered permanently in a geological setting or converted 
into a usable material such as a synthetic aggregate in concrete production. 
•  Enhanced mineralization. This is a CDR approach that accelerates natural geologic pro-
cesses around mineral reactions with CO  from the ambient air, leading to permanent 
2
carbon storage through carbonate rock. There are several types of mineralization pro-
cesses: in situ (e.g., CO  reactions in geologic formations underground), ex situ (e.g., CO  
2 2
reactions that involve extraction, transport, and grinding of minerals), and surficial (e.g., 
ambient weathering using CO -enriched fluids and on-site minerals like mine tailings). 
2
Research and development for enhanced mineralization is still early, but the potential 
capacity of CO  mineralization could be quite high  [62].  
2
Page 69 
 •  Ocean-based CDR. This is a CDR approach that removes dissolved CO from the ocean. 
2 
Ocean-based approaches include nature-based approaches (e.g., kelp afforestation), en-
gineered approaches (e.g., electrochemical CO  capture from seawater), or a combina-
2
tion of the two (e.g., growing macroalgae and sinking it to the sea floor). Ocean-based 
CDR is in early stages of research and development and merits closer study. 
 
The early stages of these potential removal strategies present some visible challenges to large 
scale deployment by 2050. For example, there is currently no large-scale proof of concept for 
DAC technology or bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, making it difficult to determine 
how well the technology can scale up and what the true cost and adverse impacts of the tech-
nology are at large scale. In parallel, some technical obstacles remain. Research to date indi-
cates that DAC requires high energy use for each metric ton of CO  removed. Other 
2
technologies, such as enhanced mineralization, are still in nascent stages of research and devel-
opment, so the potential magnitude of reductions and the timeframes over which these tech-
nologies might deliver reductions is unknown.  Other uncertainties associated with large-scale 
deployment of some technologies like BECCS could have broader upstream GHG and other en-
vironmental implications (e.g., life-cycle GHG outcomes of biomass production). 
 
Addressing these challenges and uncertainties will require a substantial and integrated re-
search, development, and deployment strategy. As one step towards the development and de-
ployment of new approaches to CDR, Congress recently created the Carbon Dioxide Removal 
Task Force to “establish a research, development, and demonstration program…to test, vali-
date, or improve technologies and strategies to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere 
on a large scale” [63]. However, additional actions will be needed to understand and innovate 
on CDR options, to reduce uncertainties, and to ensure sustainable outcomes.

 Chapter 7: Benefits of Climate Action Through 2050 
7.1 The benefits from a transformed, net-zero economy  
Bold and timely climate action towards net-zero will help the United States and the world avoid 
the worst impacts of climate change—and provide a transformative boost to the U.S. economy 
and the health and well-being of all Americans. Reductions in fossil fuel combustion and reduc-
tions in non-CO2 emissions will improve air quality and reduce the dangerous risks of climate 
change. The expansion of new industries will create high-quality jobs, maintain economic com-
petitiveness, and enable sustainable, broad-based economic growth. The benefits from this 
transformation are not constrained by political borders: U.S. action and ambitious action from 
other countries will have positive spillover effects, including driving down the cost of carbon-
free technologies and reducing the costs of climate induced disasters and conflicts around the 
world, particularly for lowest-income nations that are least able to adapt.  
 
In addition to the economic gains, action to meet the net-zero goal will, combined with global 
efforts, allow the United States to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, which are already 
being felt. For example, air pollution kills thousands of people in the United States annually  
[64] and millions worldwide, particularly in the lowest-income countries, and ongoing interna-
tional conflicts are exacerbated by climate change  [65]. The longer action is delayed, the faster 
the transition must be, potentially causing severe disruption [66]. Moreover, delay incurs more 
severe consequences such as changed weather regimes (including new extremes  [67]), higher 
sea level rise, greater ocean acidification [68], and a higher likelihood of reaching catastrophic 
damages or “tipping points” and potentially irreversible ecological impacts. These impacts have 
health and economic costs for all, but they are borne unequally, with greater consequences for 
low-income countries globally and communities of color, low-income communities, and indige-
nous communities within the United States [69]. For example, Black children are 34-41% more 
likely to live in areas with the highest projected increases in asthma diagnoses due to climate-
driven changes in particulate air pollution [68]. These impacts are addressed more completely 
in the National Climate Strategy [2].  
 
7.2 Improvements in Public Health 
Climate-driven changes in weather, human activity, and natural emissions are all expected to 
impact future air quality across the United States [70]. Acting now on climate change and de-
carbonizing our energy sector will result in vastly cleaner air, immediate and long-term im-
provements in public health, and ecological benefits throughout the United States. These 
benefits arise from several sources. 
 
Page 71 
 Reducing GHGs causes reduction in pollutants harmful to health, well-being, and productivity. 
Reducing GHGs to net-zero by 2050 will simultaneously reduce other pollutants, including par-
ticulate matter (PM), ozone and PM precursors, nitrous oxides (NO ), sulfur dioxide (SO ), and 
x 2
other air toxics. These benefits will be more significant in communities overburdened by air pol-
lution. Ozone and PM are air pollutants that adversely affect human health and are monitored 
and regulated with national standards  [71]. Human exposures to these pollutants have been 
associated with premature death, hospital admissions, and respiratory ailments, among others. 
A total of 60,600 deaths in the United States in 2019 alone were attributable to PM and ozone 
exposure  [72]. The energy sector accounts for 80% of emissions of NO  and 96% of SO [70]. As 
x 2  
the economy transitions to carbon-free energy, reductions in air pollution are also expected to 
increase productivity of the workforce due to health improvements. Beyond the traditional fo-
cus on mortality impacts, there is emerging evidence that minor health impacts from air pollu-
tants can also adversely affect educational attainment and reduce labor productivity, e.g., 
fewer tasks completed and fewer hours worked  [73]. Such improvements would be important 
because climate projections show a direct impact of future extreme temperatures reducing 
hours worked in the economy  [74]. 
 
Reducing climate change severity saves lives and improves health. Climate change threatens the 
health and well-being of Americans through catastrophic events; increases in heat-related ill-
nesses and deaths; increases in vector-, food-, and water-borne disease; and reduced food and 
water quality. In addition to immediate fatalities associated with the events themselves, ex-
treme weather events can exacerbate underlying medical conditions and disrupt critical health 
care, resulting in potentially lasting consequences. Furthermore, temperature increases have 
been linked to increases in premature death due to exposures to both cold and heat extremes; 
additionally, heat exposure has led to increases in emergency room visits and hospital admis-
sions for heat-related illnesses such as cardiovascular and respiratory conditions, kidney failure, 
and preterm birth, among others  [75]. There are large disparities in urban heat environments 
in many U.S. cities that put lower-income people and people of color at higher risk of heat ex-
posure  [76]. Changes in temperature and rainfall patterns have been implicated in the spread 
of some infectious diseases in some areas, including mosquito-borne Zika and West Nile vi-
ruses, by creating conditions that promote the expansion, abundance, and activity of certain 
disease vectors  [77]  [78]. Waterborne diseases have been associated with excessive rainfall as 
well as drought conditions. Water temperature increases have contributed to the growth of 
toxic algal blooms and harmful pathogens (e.g., Salmonella and Campylobacter), the presence 
of which can adversely affect food security and availability  [75]. As for air pollution, the bene-
fits of action to reduce impacts will be strongest in communities that are historically disadvan-
taged, low-income, and/or lack access to health services and prevention and are therefore most 
vulnerable to climate change [68]. For example, Hispanic and Latino individuals are 25-43% 
Page 72 
 more likely to currently live in areas with the highest projected labor hour losses in weather-
exposed industries due to increases in high-temperature days. 
 
7.3 Avoiding Costly Climate Impacts 
Avoiding climate change will provide immediate and sustained benefits to the economy across 
several categories. Global emissions reductions can substantially reduce the damages of climate 
change in the United States  [79]. One estimate shows reduced monetary damages from a sub-
set of climate change impacts of $49 billion/year in 2050 and up to $388 billion/year in 2090 to 
the U.S. economy in 1.5°C-compatible scenarios compared to a reference scenario, from factors 
such as fewer deaths, less damage to infrastructure, and fewer lost wages.6 Similarly, Figure 19 
shows the large and increasing benefits that accrue over time to the overall economy from a 
low-emissions pathway.7 This analysis is only a lower-bound estimate as it does not include a 
comprehensive accounting of all potential impacts such as other health effects, effects on man-
aged and unmanaged ecosystems, some indirect effects, and social impacts. 
  
 
6 The temperature and radiative forcing for the two scenarios are calculated from the median 
over an ensemble of 600 MAGICC v7.5.1 runs selected to match assessed proxy ranges  [112]. 
For the 1.5°C scenario, global mean temperature reaches 1.5°C in 2100 with a corresponding 
radiative forcing of 2.45 Wm-2 and 3.8°C in 2100 with a corresponding radiative forcing of 7.60 
Wm-2 for the Reference scenario. Descriptions of future population, GDP, the transformation of 
global temperature change to continental U.S. temperature change, estimation of sea level rise, 
and other parameters and assumptions can be found in  [111]. This framework includes impact 
estimates that employ a variety of assumptions regarding adaptive responses to climate im-
pacts. The general adaptation scenarios considered in the analyses do not capture the complex 
issues that drive adaptation decision-making at regional and local scales. Adaptation and sce-
nario assumptions used in this analysis: High Tide Flooding and Traffic impacts assume reasona-
bly anticipated adaptation measures; Rail, Roads, Electricity Transmission and Distribution 
Infrastructure, and Coastal Properties assume reactive adaptation; Extreme Temperature Mor-
tality assumes cities in cooler climates will adapt and become more resilient similar to present 
day cities in warm climates; and Ozone and PM Mortality uses 2011 emissions of co-emitted 
2.5 
pollutants. The rest of the sectors do not explicitly model adaptation.  
7 Damages, and therefore avoided damages, increase over time due to the increasing diver-
gence in global mean temperature change between the two scenarios along with growing pop-
ulations; more valuable potentially vulnerable infrastructure; and higher valuation of avoided 
mortality.

Figure 19: Projected Annual Benefits of Climate Mitigation for Select Years. Benefits 
from keeping to a 1.5⁰C trajectory grow significantly over time. U.S. annual economic 
impacts for a subset of sectors for the Reference minus 1.5°C scenario.8 Impacts pre-
sented in billions of $2017. Annual benefits of climate mitigation grow from approx. $50 
billion 2017USD in 2050 to approx. $160 billion 2017USD in 2070 and to nearly $400 bil-
lion 2017USD in 2090. In 2050, health impacts make up roughly half of annual benefits, 
with infrastructure and coastal benefits making up the next largest categories. In 2070, 
health benefits make up approximately two-fifths of annual benefits, coastal benefits 
make up slightly more than one-fifth, infrastructure benefits make up slightly less than 
one-fifth, and labor makes up the majority of remaining emissions, with only a small 
share of water resource benefits. These proportions remain similar in 2090. 
 
8 17 U.S. sectors are represented in this figure. Health impacts consist of the following sectors: extreme tempera-
ture mortality, ozone and PM2.5 mortality, valley fever, wildfire health effects, and suppression and southwest 
dust health effects. Coastal impacts consist of the following sectors: coastal property, hightide flooding and traffic, 
and tropical storm wind damages. Infrastructure consists of the following sectors: rail and road infrastructure, 
electricity demand and supply, electricity transmission and distribution, and urban drainage. Water resources con-
sist of the following sectors: water quality, winter recreation, and inland flooding. Lastly, the labor sector repre-
sents lost wages.

 7.4 Enhanced Climate Security 
 
There is a growing body of evidence that climate change can exacerbate conflict and reduce 
global security. Climate change is a national security threat because it is globally destabilizing, 
changes military operating conditions, and demands new missions [80]. This means that miti-
gating the risk of climate change not only delivers ecological, public health, and economic bene-
fits, but also enhances national and global security. By acting early and leading by example, the 
United States can build confidence in global efforts to reduce the risk of climate change [81]. 
The risks of a changing climate can make existing conflict more violent, lead to instability, and, 
through more erratic weather, affect the ability of the military to respond to security concerns. 
The U.S. National Intelligence Estimate assessment is that “climate change will increasingly ex-
acerbate risks to U.S. national security interests as the physical impacts increase and geopoliti-
cal tensions mount about how to respond to the challenge”  [82]. 
 
Extreme weather and conditions increasingly attributed to climate change already impact U.S. 
infrastructure, through the effects of sea level rise, storms, and wildfire. The U.S. Department 
of Defense calls climate change a “top management challenge” because of the threat to opera-
tional security and to the physical infrastructure of installations  [83], and finds that climate 
change is reshaping the geostrategic, operational, and tactical environments with significant im-
plications for U.S. national security and defense  [6]. It can also impact military readiness by di-
verting military assets and personnel to assist with disaster recovery, storms, and wildfire 
impact  [84].  
 
Experts agree that climate-related events (droughts, storms, wildfires, and flooding) are already 
contributing to conflict [85]. While the main conflict drivers have been related to low socioeco-
nomic development, low state capability, intergroup inequality, and a history of conflict, these 
drivers can be exacerbated by disruption related to climate change [86]. Clear causal relation-
ships between climate change and specific conflicts are the subject of ongoing research, but 
drought, floods, and other disasters related to climate change have been associated with large-
scale displacement of people and, in some cases, this has led to political instability and conflict.  
 
Climate change is related to both short-term phenomena such as extreme weather events and 
long-term impacts such as rising sea levels and persistent drought. All of these can affect the 
lives and potentially the movements of large numbers of people in a way that can increase 
stresses within and between countries. Tropical storms, which are expected to become more 
severe as climate continues to change (and have already become more severe in the Atlantic 
Basin), already can displace large populations. Hurricane Katrina, for example, traumatically dis-
placed tens of thousands of people from the city of New Orleans. In a country with lower 
Page 75 
 capacity to address such crises, a similar event could create climate refugees and cause instabil-
ity. Continued, more frequent, or more severe drought is also an expected result of climate 
change. In agricultural societies, severe drought can exacerbate stresses. Drought contributed 
to the current civil war in Syria, causing internal destabilization as well as political stresses in 
neighboring countries due to the resulting refugee crisis  [87]. The impacts of long-term chang-
ing sea level have already led to climate refugees, including in parishes in southern Louisiana 
[88]—and this can be disruptive across the world. For example, a further sea level rise of six 
inches (15 cm) could displace millions from the Nile Delta in Egypt  [89]. Instability in strategi-
cally important regions, even far from the United States, is a national security concern. 
 
Societies can respond to crises like drought and water stress by strengthening political relation-
ships that can benefit mutual security [90], but, in particular for vulnerable societies, the im-
pacts of climate change may result in increased conflict. Actively working to mitigate climate 
change along with helping communities to build resilience and adapt may reduce the risks of 
these conflicts. 
 
7.5 Building a Stronger U.S. Economy 
The revolution in climate solutions has already begun. The fastest-growing power generation 
technologies are solar and wind, with a record-setting 35 GW of deployment in 2020, account-
ing for about 80% of new capacity [91]. Globally, the zero-emissions vehicle share of new car 
sales is expected to rise from 2% today to nearly 30% by 2030 [92], with significantly higher 
numbers in the United States in line with reaching 50% new car sales. In these and many other 
sectors, the transition to carbon neutrality will accelerate for compatibility with international 
climate targets  [93], representing rapidly expanding new markets in the United States and 
globally. 
 
The economic opportunity of decarbonization is immense. The United States is well-positioned 
to incubate new innovators and firms, with a well-trained workforce and institutions that have 
enabled global leaders in information technology, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, and other 
industries [94]. Moreover, a unique endowment of natural resources makes geographic regions 
of the country well-suited to be hubs of a wide range of carbon-free activities  [40]. The United 
States can lead in the clean technologies for the 21st century, manufacturing crucial technolo-
gies like batteries, electric vehicles, and heat pumps, without sacrificing critical worker protec-
tions or a fair distribution of benefits of economic activity. 
 
Because innovation is cumulative and because many environmental technologies have returns 
to scale, investing early in the development of new technologies  [95] will boost innovation in 
climate solutions and make the pathway to carbon neutrality more economically and politically 
Page 76 
 feasible  [96]  [97]. Smart public investments in innovation stimulate private investment and 
economic growth and can help establish new (and often unforeseen) productive industries in 
the process  [98] [99]  [100]. One recent study finds social returns from investments in research 
and development are as much as four times larger than private returns  [101], and an analysis 
of data on 16 advanced countries between 1980 and 1998 found that a 1% increase in public 
research and development investment generated an extra 0.17% in long-run output  [102]. The 
benefits of accelerating innovation will spill over to our international partners, including to 
developing countries which will be hit hardest by climate damages and can least afford to take 
actions in response. 
Although the overall economy will benefit from the transition to carbon neutrality, certain fossil 
fuel-dependent sectors and regions will have a more difficult transition. Some communities are 
already experiencing economic challenges from the declines in fossil fuel-related employment  
[103], while others (predominantly low-income communities, communities of color, and 
indigenous communities) are experiencing disproportionate impacts of climate disasters and air 
pollution. A comprehensive policy strategy can support American workers and firms through 
the transition, creating high-quality jobs throughout the country, including in historically 
marginalized communities and in regions that have lost major employers and taxpayers.  
Page 77Chapter 8: Accelerating Global Climate Progress 
With our ambitious NDC target to cut emissions in half or more by 2030, and our goal for net-
zero emissions no later than 2050, the United States has committed to sustained investment in 
a vibrant clean economy that will propel global climate action while improving social, economic, 
and health equity at home.  
This report has presented the U.S. Long-Term Strategy to achieve these ambitious goals. The 
road ahead to 2050 contains opportunities, uncertainties, and challenges. The opportunities are 
clear and broad ranging, and collectively offer a pathway to reinventing and reinvigorating the 
American economy to be equitable, globally competitive, and supportive of global climate and 
sustainability goals. It will rely on American innovation and partnerships across all of society, 
including Tribal and subnational governments; private sector businesses, industry, and inves-
tors; non-governmental organizations and cultural institutions; universities, research organiza-
tions, and educational institutions; and our people. Together, we can meet the challenges in 
developing and deploying new clean technologies at scale. We can discover new and creative 
ways to provide better services and products with lower climate footprints. And we can de-
velop, train, and educate workers for productive and healthier work in new and fast-growing 
industries. Undoubtedly, the U.S. roadmap will evolve as we learn more about the potential for 
new technologies in diverse applications, and as new policy platforms are developed over time. 
The United States intends to regularly review and update this Long-Term Strategy as needed to 
consider such developments and the latest science. 
Given the rapid pace of action in the United States and other leading countries, if other major 
economies adopt similar levels of ambition, the world can keep a safer 1.5°C future within 
reach. For its part, the United States currently emits 11% of annual global GHGs (second to 
China, which emits 27% of the global total), so eliminating U.S. emissions by 2050 will make an 
important direct contribution to reaching our shared global climate goals. However, others 
must step up with both long-term and short-term ambition, and many are already doing so. To 
date, at least 63 countries representing over half current global emissions have committed to 
net-zero GHG emissions targets. Many more, representing over 70% of global emissions, are in 
diverse stages of identifying and committing to similar net-zero targets by mid-century  [104] 
[105] [106]. These commitments matter: achieving near-net-zero emissions globally by 2050 
will dramatically improve our chances of limiting global warming to 1.5°C. 
However, while the rapid expansion of 2050 targets and long-term strategies is encouraging, 
commitments to act by 2030 are also critical. Countries representing well over half of the global 
economy, including nearly all the G7 countries, have already put forward strong 2030 NDCs. 
Page 78 Leadership and action by these countries will support development of new and more affordable 
climate technologies and support enhanced diplomatic momentum to encourage global action 
toward reaching sufficient levels of near-term action.  
 
But the United States, EU, UK, Japan, Canada, Republic of Korea, South Africa, and other ambi-
tious major economies cannot do it alone. Strong 2030 NDCs will be required by all G20 econo-
mies to cut global emissions by at least 40% by 2030. Enhanced action by all G20 members to 
adopt high ambition 2030 NDCs and mid-century net-zero commitments could reduce warming 
by over 0.5°C and keep 1.5°C within reach  [107]. Globally, this is the moment for all the world’s 
major economies to act to rapidly reduce emissions to meet ambitious 2030 NDC targets and to 
develop and communicate strategies to achieve ambitious 2050 net-zero goals.
