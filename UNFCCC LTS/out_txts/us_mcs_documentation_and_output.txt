 
Appendix A – The GCAM-USA Advanced Technology Scenario 
Note: Along with the “Advanced Technology” assumptions developed for use in this report, GCAM-USA 
also has “Reference Technology” assumptions, described below. The Reference Technology assumptions 
were not used in this report but are presented to provide a reference point for the magnitude of 
technological advancement envisioned in the U.S. Mid-Century Strategy scenarios. The assumptions in 
this document were informed by U.S. Department of Energy data, but changes were made as the data 
were translated into GCAM model inputs. 
I.  Electricity Sector Assumptions 
Both the Reference and Advanced Technology scenarios use capital cost assumptions that were 
developed for selected electricity technologies. All other technologies used default GCAM values (Table 
1). The updated technology assumptions were developed specifically for 2010 to 2040 and were assumed 
to be constant after 2040.  
The Advanced Technology scenario uses a set of updated capital and O&M cost assumptions for the 
following technologies: coal (IGCC CCS), gas (CC CCS), Gen III nuclear, CSP, PV, and wind. Relative 
to the Reference scenario, costs were higher in 2020 for coal (IGCC CCS) and CSP technologies and 
lower for all other technologies. In subsequent years, the advanced capital cost assumptions were 
uniformly lower for all technologies relative to the reference (Table 1).  
In the Reference scenario, default GCAM fixed and variable operating and maintenance (O&M) costs are 
used. These costs are given for 2005 to 2015 and assumed to decrease by a constant percentage from 2015 
until they reach a maximum improvement threshold. In the Advanced Technology scenario, data for fixed 
O&M costs was developed for this report for 2010 to 2040. Values after 2040 were assumed to equal 
those in 2040. With the exception of gas (CC CCS), fixed O&M costs declined under the Advanced 
Technology scenario relative to the reference. In addition, variable O&M costs were provided for coal 
(IGCC CCS) and gas (CC CCS) technologies. These cost assumptions are higher than in the Reference 
scenario (Table 2).  
Efficiency and capacity factors assumptions did not change between the Reference and Advanced 
Technology scenarios, but are presented in Table 3 for reference. For intermittent wind and solar 
technologies without storage, capacity factors are assumed to be dependent on renewable supply curves.

1 GCAM allows biomass production to compete with land carbon storage on a carbon price basis, fully accounting 
for CO2 emissions resulting from bioenergy use and any trade-offs with potential to increase carbon storage through 
forests. GCAM assumes protection of 90% of natural forests from conversion to other land uses and across MCS 
scenarios forest land area increases. As such, biomass produced  under the MCS scenarios is limited to forms that 
result in net reductions of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere

II.  Buildings Sector Assumptions 
The buildings sector in GCAM is divided into residential and commercial sectors that model a set of 
services including heating, lighting, hot water and appliances. Each service contains a set of technologies 
that compete with one another for market share. Among these technologies are low and high-efficiency 
alternatives that are powered by both electricity and direct fuel use. Demand for services grows as a 
function of floorspace, per-capita GDP, and exogenous growth factors.  
The Reference scenario uses floorspace, exogenous demand, shell efficiency, and service technology cost, 
efficiency, and retirement assumptions developed for this report. The Advanced Technology scenario 
builds on these assumptions, but contains altered building shell efficiency trajectories and technology cost 
and efficiency assumptions. Building shell efficiency is modeled as watts of energy consumption per 
square meter. Improved shell efficiency trajectories were assumed for both the residential and commercial 
sectors under the Advanced Technology scenario, as shown by reduced consumption per square meter 
(Figure 1). Since residential and commercial trajectories converge after 2010, only commercial efficiency 
trajectories are shown in Figure 1. Floorspace is presented for residential and commercial buildings in 
Figure 2, and is the same under both Reference and Advanced Technology scenarios.  
Cost and efficiency assumptions for a subset of residential and commercial technologies were developed 
for this report. In general, both cost and efficiency increased for these technologies, reflecting a set of 
standards under which raised minimum efficiency standards are applied to the market place. These 
assumptions are described in tables 4 to 7.

III.  Industrial Sector Assumptions 
The industrial sector in GCAM is an aggregate representation of many diverse sectors. Specific industries 
such as cement and nitrogen fertilizer production are separated from the aggregate, while others are 
grouped into an ‘industrial energy use’ sector. The industrial energy use sector is organized by fuel 
consumption, with each subsector containing a set of technologies that consume a particular fuel.  
Technology assumptions in the reference scenario are taken from the core GCAM assumptions. The 
Advanced Technology scenario uses altered efficiency assumptions for a subset of technologies (Table 8).

Advanced Technology scenarios (Indexed to 1 in 2005)

IV.  Transportation Sector Assumptions 
The transportation sector is divided into freight and passenger classes, each of which contains on-road 
technologies such as cars, trucks, and motorcycles and off-road technologies such as trains. Intensity and 
capital expenditure assumptions were developed for this report for a suite of on-road technologies in the 
passenger and freight classes. These include liquid, hybrid liquid, and battery-electric vehicle (BEV) 
technologies. The reference scenario adds electric vehicles to the freight sector in GCAM. Capital cost, 
vehicle intensity, and load factor assumptions for these vehicles are presented in Table 9, alongside 
conventional liquid-fueled vehicles for comparison. In addition, the Smart Growth scenario assumes 
significantly lower transportation demand in the passenger and freight sectors. These assumptions, and 
the Reference assumptions, are presented in Figures 3 and 4.  
The Advanced Technology scenario alters efficiency and capital cost parameters for selected on-road 
freight and passenger vehicle technologies. For liquid and hybrid liquid-fueled vehicles, capital 
expenditures tend to increase relative to the reference, while fuel intensity (an inverse measure of 
efficiency) declines (Tables 10 and 11). BEVs are assumed to have lower capital costs than in the 
Reference scenario.  
In order to calibrate BEV deployment to expected levels, preference weights are utilized. Preference 
weights alter the competition between technologies within a sector for market share. If two technologies 
have equal preference weights, competition will occur on the basis of cost. Preference weights may be 
altered in order to calibrate to observed technology shares, or to emulate the role of unquantified factors 
in competition, such as public acceptance and legal and institutional barriers. In the passenger sector, 
default preference weights are set to 1 for conventional liquid technologies. Under the Reference scenario, 
preference weights for passenger and freight BEVs are linearly interpolated to 1 in 2050. Under the 
Advanced Technology scenario, passenger and freight BEV preference weights are linearly interpolated 
to 5 in 2050, in order to represent a high BEV future that is consistent with current trends and projections.

Appendix B: U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Energy Assumption Documentation 
The assumptions below are DOE information that was provided to the PNNL modeling team for their 
consideration and translation into model inputs, together with their other assumptions and policy 
frameworks. Hence, the assumptions in the Mid-Century Strategy were informed by U.S. Department of 
Energy data, but changes were made as the data were translated into GCAM model inputs.  
The Advanced Technology assumptions reflect achievement of DOE program goals through success of 
continued RDD&D at current levels, while the Stretch Technology assumptions reflect more aggressive 
RDD&D goals, such as would be enabled by Mission Innovation. 
Table B.1: Descriptions of Analysis Cases  
EPSA Base Case: A variation of the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) Annual Energy 
Outlook (AEO) 2015 High Oil and Gas Resource Case,5 which includes one potential implementation 
of the Clean Power Plan, wind and solar tax credit extensions6, updated carbon capture utilization and 
storage cost and performance estimates,7 and updated solar and wind technology cost and performance 
estimates that are consistent with AEO 2016. 
Advanced Technology Assumptions: Current DOE energy program goals overlaid on top of the 
EPSA Base Case. Major changes from the Base Case to the Advanced Technology assumptions 
include: changes to cost and performance of new and retrofitted coal and new natural gas combined 
cycle units with carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS), a representative advanced nuclear 
plant, central and distributed solar, onshore and offshore wind, geothermal, and hydropower, and 
enhanced transmission capacity and load shifting to reflect modernization of the electric grid. 
Significant changes to costs in industrial, buildings, and transportation technologies are also included 
and reduce demand for electricity generation. Assumes all current goals are met, though this outcome is 
uncertain.  
Stretch Technology Assumptions: Stretch DOE energy program estimates (including more ambitious 
cost and performance) enabled by additional RDD&D support such as through Mission Innovation and 
overlaid on top of the Advanced Technology assumptions. Major changes from the Advanced 
Technology assumptions include: changes to costs for a representative advanced nuclear plant, new and 
retrofitted coal and new natural gas combined cycle CCUS plants, onshore and offshore wind, central 
and distributed solar, hydropower plants and geothermal sites; increased hydropower and geothermal 
resource availability; reduced costs for biofuel processing; improved light-duty vehicle battery, light-
weighting, and electric drive systems; increased efficiency for heavy duty vehicles; reduced cost of 
hydrogen; improved manufacturing and industrial motor system efficiency; increased efficiency for 
building appliances; increased maximum percentage of variable generation allowed on the electric grid, 
enabled by advances in grid modernization.

Further details on these and other aspects of DOE analysis aree forthcoming on the DOE website. 
 
Advanced Technology Assumptions 
Bioenergy: Reductions in biofuel costs for cellulosic ethanol and biofuel liquids processed using Fischer-
Tropsch or pyrolysis pathways to achieve goals of $2.65 and $3.00 per gallon with biomass feedstock 
cost of $84 per ton (EERE BETO biomass cost assumption) ready for commercialization in 2020 and 
2025; additional capital cost reductions from learning as more capacity is built after near-term goals are 
reached. Biomass-to-liquids processing conversion efficiency improved and planned new capacity of 50 
million gallons/year of advanced biofuels by 2020 included (EERE BETO goals and sponsored 
demonstration). 
Vehicles: Changes in vehicle costs and improved fuel economy for all vehicle types, and increase in 
availability of hybrid, electric vehicles (EVs), and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), leading to a 38% 
increase in average light-duty vehicle fuel economy sold in 2040 and a 21% increase in the on-road fleet 
average (vehicle attributes by type from Argonne National Laboratory Autonomie studyi) in 2040 relative 
to the EPSA Base Case. 
Vehicles: Modification of heavy duty-vehicle (HDV) types to better represent EERE VTO HDV 
classifications and changes in HDV costs and projected fuel economy by vehicle class (following BaSCe 
analysis of VTO programii) leading to an average 20% improvement in new HDV fuel economy by 2040 
and a 15% improvement in average HDV fuel economy by 2040 relative to the EPSA Base Case. 
Fuel Cells: Short and long term cost reductions for the retail price of hydrogen, $7/kg-H  ramping down 
2
to $4/kg-H  by 2020 and held constant thereafter.  For the fuel cell electric vehicles, costs and fuel 
2
economies from Argonne National Laboratory Autonomie outputs. 
Buildings: For residential and commercial buildings, increased stringency of appliance standards and 
building codes, improved new building shell technology performance, introduced new cost effective 
energy efficient technologies, increased the rate of building shell upgrades, and increased consumer 
acceptance of high efficiency products (represented by lowering hurdle rates to 7 percent by 2025 and 
removal of non-economic decision-making factors) leading to achievement of the EERE BTO goal of 
reducing energy use per square foot in all U.S. buildings by 30% in 2030 from 2010 levels, with a longer 
term goal of achieving a 50% reduction. 
Advanced Manufacturing: EIA AEO industrial high tech assumptions (earlier availability, lower costs, 
and higher efficiency industrial equipment and a more rapid rate of improvement in the recovery of 
biomass byproducts from industrial processes) combined with technology improvements, which yields 
more efficient energy use for pulp & paper, iron & steel, petroleum refining, chemicals, and cement (2007 
and 2015 AMO Bandwidth studiesiii), and updated data on the use of recycled aluminum (2006 – 2014  
USGS Minerals Yearbookiv). 
Fossil Energy: Improvements to capital cost trajectories, heat rates, and fixed and variable operating and 
maintenance costs for new full capture coal and NGCC CCUS plants, partial capture coal CCUS plants, 
and existing coal units that are retrofitted with CCUS. 
Nuclear: 9% reduction in projected overnight capital costs for state-of-the art nuclear technology in 2025 
and 32% by 2040 relative to the EPSA Base Case. O&M costs reduced by about 9% and new nuclear 
plant build times reduced from 6 to 5 years. Assumes existing nuclear plants will receive license 
16 
  
extensions to operate for 80 years, with no early retirements. Note that recently announced retirements of 
nuclear generating units were not included in this analysis. 
Electricity Delivery and Grid Modernization: Share of new transmission capacity applied to reserves 
increased from 75% to 85% reflecting improved sensors & controls and enhanced regional coordination. 
Available capacity on existing transmission lines was increased from 75% to 85%. Spinning reserve 
requirements for variable renewables decreased from 50% to 30% of generation, reflecting more use of 
energy storage and other demand side capabilities. Maximum use of load shifting technologies for 
reducing peak demand tripled from a national average of 3.5% to 11% by 2040, reflecting greater use of 
distributed energy resources and storage technologies. Improvement in utility grid interconnection 
limitation factors for new distributed generation in buildings was accelerated by 10 years. 
Solar: Cost reductions for utility-scale, commercial, and residential PV following the Draft 2016 NREL 
Annual Technology Baseline (ATB) Low Case. Solar thermal/concentrated solar power (CSP) was 
modified to reflect a technology with 6-hours of electricity storage, leading to improved capacity factors 
and capital costs that are higher in the near term than the EPSA Base Case assumptions. By 2040, capital 
costs are 22% below the EPSA Base Case and O&M costs are 41% below the EPSA Base Case. 
Wind:8  For onshore and offshore wind power, capital costs were reduced from the EPSA Base Case by 
20% and 32% respectively by 2020, and reduced by 19% and 44%, respectively, by 2040 for the best 
wind classes, with more modest reductions for lower wind classes based on the draft 2016 ATB Low 
Case.v  Capacity factors were also improved, ranging from roughly a 13% to 28% increase for onshore 
wind by 2020 and a 24% to 44% increase by 2040, and a 15% to 19% increase for offshore wind by 2020 
and a 28% to 34% increase by 2040 compared to the EPSA Base Case. Also lengthened the onshore wind 
PTC eligibility schedule by 1 year and increased the construction time from 3 to 4 years based on new 
IRS guidance. 
Hydropower: Improved the site-specific costs, performance and resource availability for some 
hydropower sites, including adding upgrade options for existing sites. 
Geothermal: Reduced site-specific costs for geothermal flash, binary and enhanced geothermal sites by 
12.5% by 2040 compared to current costs, following the Draft 2016 NREL ATB.vi 
 
Stretch Technology Assumptions 
Bioenergy: Decreased cost of biofuels (biomass-to-liquids and pyrolysis) from $3/gallon in the Advanced 
Technology assumptions to $2.50/gallon by 2040 (at $84/ton biomass). Increased number of initial 
biofuel plants from 3 to 30 before NEMS growth limits start to apply. Same new planned capacity as for 
Advanced Technology assumptions included for Stretch Technology assumptions. 
Vehicles: LDVs: Modified vehicle choice model to allow all types of LDVs to compete on vehicle 
attributes only. Advanced Technology cost assumptions plus an additional 4% weight reduction due to 
vehicle light-weighting by reducing fuel consumption by 6% (conventional/hybrid) or 4% (EVs) for every 
10% decrease in vehicle weight. Reduced the cost of energy storage for plug-in hybrid EVs (PHEVs) and 
                                                           
8 The ATB Low Case does not capture all of the projected cost reductions anticipated in the current Wind Program 
Goals. 
17 
  
battery EVs (BEVs) to $100/kWh by 2030, compared to $120/kWh in the Advanced Technology 
assumptions.  
Vehicles: HDVs: Advanced Technology cost assumptions plus increased maximum market penetration 
rate for hybrids and advanced conventional vehicles (following Super Truck definition); accelerated 
adoption of advanced conventional and hybrid vehicles by modifying S-shape diffusion curve 50% 
parameter from 14 to 10 years.  
Fuel Cells: Reduced the modeled commercial scale cost of automotive fuel cells to $35/kW by 2030, and 
$30/kW by 2040. Reduced the cost of hydrogen (dispensed and untaxed) to $4.00/gge9 in 2020, to $3.00 
in 2030 and to $2.50 in 2040 (on the path towards $2.00 in 2050). Assumed all hydrogen was produced 
from renewable sources and had no GHG emissions associated with production. 
Buildings: Residential Buildings: Advanced technology assumptions with the following changes: 
Reduced energy consumption by 40% from 2009 by 2030 for miscellaneous electric loads (MELs); 
removed the option for building shell packages that achieve less than 50% energy reduction from IECC 
2009 levels from 2030 onwards.  
Buildings: Commercial Buildings: Advanced technology assumptions with the following changes: for 
Miscellaneous Electronic Loads other than office equipment), flat energy use intensity after 2010. 
Modified new building shells to represent 100% adoption of a 50% reduction relative to the ASHRAE 
90.1-2007 standards which is equivalent to a 29% improvement from the EPSA Base Case. 
Geothermal: Increased efficiency for the least efficient geothermal heat pumps for use in residential and 
commercial buildings. 
Advanced Manufacturing: For all of the non-refining manufacturing processes except cement & lime, 
aluminum, and glass, improved process efficiency by 50% beyond the EPSA Base Case by 2040. 
Improved industrial motor-driven system efficiency for pumps, fans and air compressors following 
Annual Energy Outlook 2014 Low Electricity Demandvii case. Net result is an approximately 20% 
reduction in non-refining industrial energy consumption by 2040 relative to the EPSA Base Case. 
Fossil Energy: Improvements in capital costs, O&M costs, and heat rates for CCUS technologies are 
accelerated in the Stretch Technology assumptions, reaching the same long-term goals as the Advanced 
Technology assumptions 8 years earlier (by 2030). 
Nuclear: 14% reduction in projected overnight capital costs for state-of-the art nuclear technology in 2025 
and 30% by 2040 relative to the Advanced Technology assumptions (22% in 2025 and 53% from the 
EPSA Base Case). O&M costs reduced by 28% from Advanced Tech assumptions and new nuclear plant 
build times reduced from 5 years to 4 years. 
Electricity Delivery and Grid Modernization: Advanced Technology assumptions plus increased 
maximum percentage of regional variable generation from 40% to 50%, enabled by grid advances. 
Solar:10 Similar overnight capital cost trajectories for utility solar PV as for Advanced Technology 
assumptions with no change in 2020 and 2025, but ramping down to a 13% reduction from the Advanced 
Technology assumptions and 52% improvement in O&M costs by 2040. For CSP, approximately a 35% 
                                                           
9 Gallon Gasoline Equivalent 
10 The Solar Energy Technologies Office has updated its technology cost and performance goals since this analysis 
was performed. The newly updated goal – to cut the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) from utility-scale solar by 
an additional 50% between 2020 and 2030 to $0.03 per kilowatt hour, while also addressing grid integration. 
18 
  
reduction in overnight capital costs from the Advanced Technology assumptions in 2020 and then 
approximately a 6% cost reduction compared to the Advanced Technology assumptions out to 2040. 14% 
reduction in O&M costs for CSP from Advanced Technology assumptions.  Reduced capital and O&M 
costs for rooftop solar PV in residential and commercial buildings by ~40% for capital and ~60% for 
O&M by 2040 compared to the Advanced Technology assumptions, and reduced degradation in PV 
panels.  
Wind: Same capacity factors, construction time and similar fixed O&M costs as for the Advanced 
Technology assumptions. 25% lower overnight capital costs in 2025, and 55% lower overnight capital 
costs from 2030 onwards for onshore wind as compared to Advanced Technology assumptions. For 
offshore wind, 14% lower overnight capital costs in 2025 and ~50% lower overnight capital costs from 
2030 onwards as compared to Advanced Technology assumptions.  
Hydropower: Advanced Technology assumptions plus further reduced overnight capital costs for new 
stream reach development and non-powered dams by an additional 42% and 51%, respectively, beyond 
the Advanced Technology costs by 2040. 
Geothermal: Added undiscovered hydrothermal and deep Enhanced Geothermal System sites and reduced 
initial costs for existing sites by 40% relative to the EPSA Base Case; by 2040, overnight capital costs are 
further reduced by 35%.

Appendix D: Model Documentation for the Global Timber Model as Applied for the U.S. Mid-
Century Strategy for Deep Decarbonization  
1.1  Introduction 
The U.S. Mid-Century Strategy (MCS) for Deep Decarbonization report provides a road map for 
energy, transportation, industrial and land use sector mitigation policy action and technology development 
for achieving long-term climate stabilization targets prioritized under the Paris Agreement. The land use 
chapter relies on information from multiple models that represent components of the U.S. land use 
sectors, including detailed depictions of forested lands. Each modelling framework is different in how it 
depicts future forest land use and management decisions, but each can be used to inform the potential 
implications of policies targeting increased carbon sequestration or biomass energy expansion. One of the 
forest sector models used to inform the U.S. MCS analysis is the Global Timber Model (GTM) - an 
intertemporal economic optimization model of the global forestry sector developed and used in this 
analysis via collaboration between staff of The Ohio State University, U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency and RTI International. The primary goal of this document is to provide a brief model description 
of GTM and an overview of key data and parameters within the model. Supplemental appendices provide 
additional detail on the model, its algebraic structure, and scenario assumptions for the MCS analysis.  
1.2  Model Background 
GTM provides a long-term view of forest resource use and product supply under assumed future 
market, policy, and environmental conditions. Specifically, it determines optimal levels of timber 
harvests, timber investments, and land use over time (by evaluating forest management profile including 
rotation lengths, species mix, and management intensity) and has detailed carbon accounting. GTM is a 
well-known global forest sector model that has been applied to a variety of different applications in 
numerous peer-reviewed publications. Initially it was used as a policy tool to assess climate change 
impacts in the forest sector (see Sohngen et al., 1999, 2001). It has subsequently been expanded for use in 
analysis of carbon sequestration potential in the forest sector under climate change mitigation incentives 
(Sohngen and Mendelsohn, 2003, 2007; Kindermann et al., 2008; Baker et al., 2016). Most recently, it 
has been used to assess the implications of bioenergy policies on carbon fluxes (Daigneault et al., 2012, 
Favero and Mendelsohn, 2014; Kim, 2015). Details on the market response functions in the model are 
described in Sohngen et al. (1999), the development of price paths for carbon sequestration are described 
in Sohngen and Sedjo (2006), and the response to these price paths by land supply, timber demand, and 
technical change in the forest sector is shown in Sohngen and Mendelsohn (2007).  
1.3  Model Description   
GTM generates projections using detailed biophysical and economic forestry data for different 
countries and regions globally, including the U.S. Specifically, GTM is generally used to project potential 
future timber resource and market conditions, and related carbon implications. To do so, the model 
maximizes the net present value of consumers’ and producers’ surplus (net welfare) in the forestry sector. 
Consumers’ surplus for timber markets is derived from inverse timber demand functions calculated from 
timber prices and consumption quantities that are endogenous to the model solution. Producers’ surplus is 
composed of the gross returns to timber harvests minus the costs of managing and holding timberland. 
The costs of managing timberland include the costs of replanting timber and the costs of harvesting, 
Draft – Deliberative    37 
  
accessing, and transporting timber. There is an opportunity cost of maintaining land in forests rather than 
switching to agriculture for crop cultivation and livestock grazing. 
GTM has the flexibility to be run over varying, long term time horizons (200+ years). The model 
has more than 150 disaggregated U.S. forest types and over 200 forests and management types globally, 
explicit representation of pulpwood and sawtimber demand, and endogenous global trade flows. The 
model solution determines how much to harvest in each age class and time period, how many hectares to 
regenerate in each type in each time period, how intensively to regenerate the hectares when they are 
planted, and how many new hectares of high-value plantations to establish. As a dynamic intertemporal 
economic optimization model, GTM relies on forward-looking behavior and solves all time periods at the 
same time. This dynamic optimization approach means that land owners incorporate future market 
expectations into land use and forest management decisions today to reflect future expectations (i.e., 
decisions anticipate future potential net returns).  
Intertemporal optimization is an important model attribute, as in practice, forestry investments are 
made today with expected returns often decades into the future. For example, when forests are planted, 
the amount of money spent planting/managing forests is determined consistent with future expectations 
about timber prices. Forestland owners attempt to neither over-invest nor under-invest in forest resources, 
based on the current period’s expectations of the future. In addition, when forests are harvested, forestland 
managers have the option to allow land to regenerate naturally or convert to a more intensively 
managed/planted system. This decision is based on anticipated future market conditions. The dynamic 
optimization modeling approach is based on Sedjo and Lyon (1990). The volume edited by M. Kallio et 
al. (1987) provides a detailed description of the differences among the various types of forestry models, 
while Sohngen and Sedjo (1998) illustrate the mathematical differences and the implications of the 
various forestry modeling approaches on policy outcomes. 
The model determines forest product prices endogenously, demand is not fixed over time, and 
market prices are decision variables from optimal resource allocation. Emissions trajectories can fluctuate 
as demand is not fixed, and land use decisions are made so all markets clear simultaneously over the 
simulation, which can cause changes in decisions variables between periods. Also, as this type of 
modeling approach reflects investment behavior, it often reflects higher levels of forest carbon 
sequestration rates in the near or medium-term than other modeling techniques. For example, statistical 
forecasting and recursive dynamic models adjust to market conditions on a period to period basis, and 
therefore do not account for expected future returns. They adjust land use/management in each period 
based on previous period conditions and supply-side constraints (e.g., urban development assumptions).  
1.4  Data and Key Parameters 
GTM forest product demand growth globally is based on projections of population and gross 
domestic product growth, which can come from a number of sources. For instance, previous GTM 
analyses have calibrated GTM to macroeconomic projections from the U.S. Energy Information 
Administration’s Annual Energy Outlook (AEO) and other global projections (e.g., Baker et al., 2016). 
For the U.S. MCS analysis, macroeconomic inputs, including population, GDP, and bioenergy demand, in 
GTM are derived from MCS Benchmark scenario (see Addendum A for more information on MCS 
scenario inputs).

1.4.1   Forest Inventory Data  
Data on initial forest area and inventories in the model were obtained from multiple sources (see 
Table 1). For most developed countries and temperate forests, inventories were obtained from original 
sources within the countries or regions because those sources often also contain detailed information 
(such as age classes). For most developing countries in tropical regions, information on forest areas was 
obtained from the UN FAO (2005, 2010, and 2015).

1.4.2  Forest Yield Growth  
As mentioned above, GTM model has more than 150 disaggregated U.S. forest types and over 
200 forests and management types globally, explicit representation of pulpwood and sawtimber demand, 
and endogenous global trade flows. In this model, sawtimber and pulpwood are drawn from the same 
forest resource base, which is allocated to either product group after harvest. To account for differences in 
ecological productivity for different tree species, the model reflects different forest land classes for 
various regions of the world. These land classes have different yield functions for timber. For example, in 
the U.S., forest land classes can be based on species (e.g., Douglas Fir) and land quality (based on the FIA 
designation of site class productivity). Furthermore, forests are broken into different types of management 
classes. The management classes are moderately valued forests, inaccessible forests, low-value forests, 
low-value timberland in inaccessible areas, low-value timberland in semi-accessible areas, and lastly 
high-valued timber plantation.   
Draft – Deliberative    39 
  
GTM accounts for historical natural disturbances in yield functions in future projections, but does 
not typically account for climate change impacts on natural disturbance patterns in the future unless a 
specific future climate change scenario is applied. The model also accounts for historical carbon 
fertilization in yield functions into the future but it does not account for future increased carbon 
fertilization unless a specific future climate change scenario is applied. With increased future carbon 
fertilization included, future estimates are expected to be larger (depending on global productivity gains 
and prices). 
1.4.3  Forest Product Demand   
Price elasticities of demand in the demand functions for sawtimber and pulpwood were 
determined by examining the literature. Estimates for small regions or nations tend to suggest that forest 
demand is fairly inelastic, but these do not represent the entire global market for industrial wood. These 
estimates range from −0.14 to −0.17 in the Pacific Northwest (Haynes et al. 1981, for wood products), to 
−0.43 for pulpwood to −0.57 for sawtimber in the US South (Newman 1987). Estimates of demand 
elasticity using global datasets and looking across countries seem to suggest that demand is more elastic: 
(Simangunsong and Buongiorno (2001) reported end product elasticity estimates from −0.62 for 
sawnwood to −1.33 for plywood, with long-run estimates being more elastic than short-run estimates; 
Uusivuori and Kuuluvainen (2001) found own-price elasticity estimates for industrial roundwood imports 
from −0.69 for nontropical hardwoods to −0.92 for softwood and −0.95 for wood chips, and; Turner and 
Buongiorno (2004) found more inelastic demand for roundwood imports of −0.74. 
For most applications, the model assumes that price elasticity of demand for both sawtimber and 
pulpwood is 1.0 (see Table 2 in Addendum A: GTM Scenario Parameters, Assumptions and Key 
Results for Mid-Century Strategy for Deep Decarbonization Report  
For the MCS analysis, GTM scenarios were developed to present alternative futures for 
timberland management, investment, and carbon stocks as influenced by macroeconomic drivers and key 
policy variables. GTM presents a unique perspective on future forest management and associated forest 
carbon stock trends for several reasons. First, the intertemporal optimization framework uses forward-
looking expectations of future market and policy conditions to invest in the forest resource base at the 
intensive and extensive margins. This modeling construct allows for the evaluation of how changes in 
policy assumptions (e.g., incentives to expand forest biomass utilization for energy) could lead to changes 
in forest sector investment and management. Second, GTM is a global model and thus recognizes that 
projected changes in the U.S. forest resource base (including harvest levels) will be driven in part by 
forest resource management and markets in the rest of the world. Thus, GTM scenarios developed for the 
MCS allow for a direct analysis of how climate/land use policy actions (such as bioenergy expansion and 
carbon sequestration programs) affect forest management trends and markets, both domestically and 
internationally.  
For the MCS analysis, scenarios implemented with GTM were designed to reflect alternative 
futures for U.S. and global forestland management under different policy drivers aligned to the MCS 
Benchmark and other scenarios developed with the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM). This 
approach allows for consistent alignment between GTM and other models employed for the MCS, 
Draft – Deliberative    40 
  
drawing specific policy and macroeconomic variables from the MCS Benchmark GCAM scenario 
presented in the MCS Deep Decarbonization Report.  
To align with the GCAM MCS scenarios, three separate scenarios were developed for GTM to 
represent alternative policy and market futures, thus yielding Low, Medium and High forest carbon sink 
scenarios that reflect different forest-derived biomass and carbon sequestration incentives as discussed 
below. 
  GTM Low Sink: This scenario was created by taking GCAM regional GDP and 
population projections from the GCAM baseline and calculating aggregate income and 
population growth rates for the world. Based on these baseline projections, GTM per 
capita GDP is expected to grow globally at a rate of 1.8% per year on average over the 
next 50 years, tapering off to 1.6% per year for the next 50 years, and 1.0% per year for 
the ensuring century. It is assumed that demand growth falls to 0.0% per year in the final 
two decades of the scenarios to assist in imposing our terminal condition. These growth 
rates are used to shift the future demand for pulpwood and sawtimber products over 
time, with assumed income elasticities of 0.9 for both sawtimber and pulpwood. This 
scenario does not include additional demand growth in forest biomass to contribute to 
MCS renewable energy or negative emissions technology growth. Furthermore, this 
scenario does not incentivize carbon sequestration from the forest sector. 
  GTM Medium Sink: The GTM Medium Sink scenario uses the same GDP and 
population growth rates as the Low Sink, but includes increased demand for woody 
biomass to meet bioenergy demands. The consumption levels are converted from 
Gigajoules to million m3 of forest biomass. The demand growth for pulpwood and 
sawtimber is then adjusted to account for this new source of demand. Demand is 
adjusted by assuming 70%-30% split between pulpwood and sawtimber to meet the 
biomass for energy requirement. This increase in demand incentivizes near term 
increased forest management and afforestation in anticipation of higher market returns 
and increased forest biomass demand in the future. Thus, the projected forest net flux 
increases in the near term in forest management beyond the Low Sink scenario levels.   
  GTM High Sink: The GTM high sink scenario similarly adjusts pulpwood and 
sawtimber demand consistent with the Medium Sink scenario but also adds global 
carbon mitigation incentives that increase forest carbon sequestration. This approach 
combines the effect of increased investment in the forest sector driven by increased 
demand for biomass for energy with mitigation incentives for enhancing forest carbon 
sequestration, and the net result is a higher net emissions flux relative to the Low and 
Medium sink scenarios (this approach is discussed in Baker et al., 2016).  
For the MCS analysis, GTM was run for 200 years at 10-year time steps, and relied on the global forest 
data, forest yield growth information and carbon modeling approach described in the main body of this 
report.

Addendum B. Algebraic Structure for list of indexes, variables, functions, and parameters). This 
estimate was chosen due to several reasons. First, this model employs a global demand function (not a 
regional or local demand function) so one would expect demand to be more inelastic for individual 
countries, where substitution possibilities may be more limited in the short term than globally. Second, 
the GTM demand function is for a general basket of industrial sawtimber or pulpwood which are used to 
produce a range of outputs and are fairly undifferentiated, with high substitution potential. Demand for 
industrial sawtimber or pulpwood, as undifferentiated commodities, is assumed to be more elastic than 
demand for specialized end products. Third, this model is a long-run optimization model and none of the 
estimates above use time periods as long as GTM (200 years, depending on the study at hand). Over 
longer time periods, one would expect more substitution possibilities and thus more elastic demand. 
 Income elasticity also plays a major role in the inverse demand function in GTM. Nearly all of 
the studies above estimate income elasticity to be fairly elastic, suggesting a small amount of increased 
income could lead to large increases in wood product demand. For example, Simangunsong and 
Buongiorno (2001) reported median estimates of income elasticity from the literature of around 1.0, and 
Turner and Buongiorno (2004) found that income elasticity for industrial roundwood is 2.21. The model 
therefore generally uses a slightly lower value, 0.9, than the estimates above to account for the potential 
influence of new products on the future market that will perform the same service as wood but do so more 
efficiently. Such substitution would lower demand for industrial wood, which is modeled here, even 
though demand for the output (wood services) could continue to rise with rising income.  
The rate of aggregate forestland change is determined by land supply functions, as well as land 
rental functions that are applied to each region. These rental functions are generally shifting inward and 
upward (representing increasing demand for land use in agriculture in most regions of the world). Total 
timber area in each age class and forest type is a stock variable and adjusts over time dependent on initial 
forest area, afforestation, and harvested area. Bringing new forestland into the system requires an 
investment cost, represented by land supply and rental functions. As forest rents increase, the model 
increases the amount of land in forestry, paying increased costs for the extensive margin expansion. This 
is an important model attribute—policy mechanisms that increase demand for pulpwood or sawtimber, or 
that generally increase forestry rents, will drive extensive margin expansion on the land supply frontier.   
There is a key difference between the conversions of land in the temperate/boreal zones and the 
tropics; the lands in the temperate/boreal regions are assumed to have no opportunity costs so they remain 
in forestry. In contrast, opportunity costs may be greater than 0 in the tropics (shown in equations 1.3i 
through 1.3n in Addendum B). Each inaccessible type in temperate and boreal zones is linked to a semi-
accessible type (see equation 1.7). The semi-accessible types start with no forest area. When inaccessible 
forests are accessed, the hectares are converted to a similar semi-accessible type. Thus, the total area of 
inaccessible and semi-accessible forest area in moderately valued forests remain constant over the 
scenario time horizon. So, an implicit assumption is made in temperate and boreal regions that the 
opportunity costs of converting land in inaccessible/semi-accessible regions is 0 and thus that the rental 
costs are 0. However, in tropical zones semi-accessible and inaccessible low-value timberland are 
assumed to rental functions that are greater than 0. In tropical zones if the value of accessing the land 
exceeds the marginal access costs then the forest will be harvested. After harvest, the land can be 
converted to agriculture or returned to forest depending on the opportunity costs of land and the value of 
future timber harvests. There are two reasons why forests may be accessed in tropical regions, either due 
Draft – Deliberative    42 
  
to timber demand or demand for land conversion. The demand for land conversion is driven by the rental 
functions, which generally are shifting inward and upward in tropical regions (representing increasing 
demand for land use in agriculture).    
Some additional items that are considered within the model are the cost of transporting timber to 
timber to mills, and the decision to collect forest residues to be used for bioenergy. GTM has spatially 
explicit forest stands with the distance to harvest and distance to mills used to calculate the cost of 
accessing and transporting timber (equations 1.17 and 1.18 in Addendum B). Second, in scenario 
applications with policy incentives targeting forest bioenergy demand, the model can use pulpwood, 
sawtimber or forest residues from accessible timberlands for pulpwood. Furthermore, some residue 
material can be collected and used for pulpwood, where the costs of this collection is determined 
implicitly in the model (shown in equation 1.21 and 1.22 in Addendum B).  
Forest biomass for energy production is captured by exogenous demand shifters in which the total 
demand for pulpwood and sawtimber is increased by the assumed amount of forest biomass demanded 
from the forest sector for energy generation purposes. This approach allows one to create custom 
scenarios in which forest biomass demand is calibrated directly to energy sector projections. That is, 
given expectations of renewable energy demand to be met from biomass sources, GTM demand 
projections are adjusted to account for the requisite biomass needed for the energy system. This approach 
requires separate recalibration of the demand functions for pulpwood and/or sawtimber to account for the 
exogenous demand increase driven by bioenergy expansion.   
1.5  Carbon Modeling  
Carbon modeling in GTM includes representation of the following forest carbon pools 
aboveground carbon, slash, marketed products, and soils. The model does not include data or results for 
urban forests, agricultural soils or landfilled yard trimmings and food scraps. The methods for calculating 
carbon follow the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Good Practice Guidance (Penman 
et al., 2003).  
Aboveground carbon is estimated by using the density of wood, the root-to-shoot ratio, and the 
proportion of biomass that is carbon. This is determined for each timber type, age class, and time period. 
The calculation of aboveground carbon is show in equations 1.25 and 1.26 in Addendum C, with 
descriptions of the variables describes in table 3.  
Carbon in the slash pool represents the dead timber material left in forests after harvests or land 
use conversion, material that is not used for marketed wood products and is too costly to remove from the 
forest. If forest residues are harvested, they are harvested from this pool. In some cases, slash is burned by 
landowners, and in other cases, slash is simply left behind to decompose. To calculate the amount of slash 
left in the forest at the time of timber harvest or land use conversion, the model starts with the amount of 
carbon in forests and deducts the amount removed for timber or other products (equation 1.27). Because 
the slash pool is built up over many years, at the start of the simulations GTM uses the initial-year 
harvests to calculate an initial slash pool for each timber type i based on the initial harvest. This 
calculation will affect the baseline rate of slash accumulation, but it will not alter the change in slash 
accumulation in the policy scenarios. 
Draft – Deliberative    43 
  
Carbon in harvested wood products is calculated similarly, although the difference in sawtimber 
and pulpwood products are accounted for. Methodologically, however, annual contributions to the 
sawtimber and pulpwood pools are calculated similarly (equations 1.29 and 1.30). It is assumed that some 
of the carbon in the marketed product pools turns over, or decomposes, and is released to the atmosphere 
each year (equations 1.31 and 1.32). Usually 25 to 35% of the amount harvested is emitted relatively 
quickly in the production process. This emission often occurs in the form of harvesting residues that are 
burned for energy or discarded immediately. Wood products then enter useful products and eventually are 
discarded and are assumed to decompose over time.  
Soil carbon is maintained in three separate stocks: forest soil carbon in forests maintained as 
forests, agricultural soils on lands converted to forest, and forest soil converted to agricultural use. For 
forests maintained as forests (no land use change), the soil stocks remain constant. When land use 
changes, such as from forest to non-forest or vice versa, the model calculates the net gain or loss in 
carbon to or from the atmosphere. This is accomplished by tracking the total pool of soil carbon in forests 
but only deducting the net losses when forests are converted to agriculture (or vice versa for lands 
converted to forest). Soils that have converted from agriculture to forests begin with an average amount of 
carbon in soils for the given region and then accumulate carbon in soils over time. The pool of soil carbon 
accumulates over time according to a logistic growth function (Addendum C, equations 1.33 and 1.34). 
For soil carbon associated with land conversion of forests into agriculture, the present value of carbon lost 
over time is calculated and these losses are assigned to the hectares removed from forestry in the year 
removed. This approach simplifies the need to account for the carbon in these hectares after they have 
exited the model, and it results in a relatively conservative net estimate of the carbon losses when land is 
converted out of forest.

Addendum A: GTM Scenario Parameters, Assumptions and Key Results for Mid-Century Strategy 
for Deep Decarbonization Report  
For the MCS analysis, GTM scenarios were developed to present alternative futures for 
timberland management, investment, and carbon stocks as influenced by macroeconomic drivers and key 
policy variables. GTM presents a unique perspective on future forest management and associated forest 
carbon stock trends for several reasons. First, the intertemporal optimization framework uses forward-
looking expectations of future market and policy conditions to invest in the forest resource base at the 
intensive and extensive margins. This modeling construct allows for the evaluation of how changes in 
policy assumptions (e.g., incentives to expand forest biomass utilization for energy) could lead to changes 
in forest sector investment and management. Second, GTM is a global model and thus recognizes that 
projected changes in the U.S. forest resource base (including harvest levels) will be driven in part by 
forest resource management and markets in the rest of the world. Thus, GTM scenarios developed for the 
MCS allow for a direct analysis of how climate/land use policy actions (such as bioenergy expansion and 
carbon sequestration programs) affect forest management trends and markets, both domestically and 
internationally.  
For the MCS analysis, scenarios implemented with GTM were designed to reflect alternative 
futures for U.S. and global forestland management under different policy drivers aligned to the MCS 
Benchmark and other scenarios developed with the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM). This 
approach allows for consistent alignment between GTM and other models employed for the MCS, 
drawing specific policy and macroeconomic variables from the MCS Benchmark GCAM scenario 
presented in the MCS Deep Decarbonization Report.  
To align with the GCAM MCS scenarios, three separate scenarios were developed for GTM to 
represent alternative policy and market futures, thus yielding Low, Medium and High forest carbon sink 
scenarios that reflect different forest-derived biomass and carbon sequestration incentives as discussed 
below. 
  GTM Low Sink: This scenario was created by taking GCAM regional GDP and 
population projections from the GCAM baseline and calculating aggregate income and 
population growth rates for the world. Based on these baseline projections, GTM per 
capita GDP is expected to grow globally at a rate of 1.8% per year on average over the 
next 50 years, tapering off to 1.6% per year for the next 50 years, and 1.0% per year for 
the ensuring century. It is assumed that demand growth falls to 0.0% per year in the final 
two decades of the scenarios to assist in imposing our terminal condition. These growth 
rates are used to shift the future demand for pulpwood and sawtimber products over 
time, with assumed income elasticities of 0.9 for both sawtimber and pulpwood. This 
scenario does not include additional demand growth in forest biomass to contribute to 
MCS renewable energy or negative emissions technology growth. Furthermore, this 
scenario does not incentivize carbon sequestration from the forest sector. 
  GTM Medium Sink: The GTM Medium Sink scenario uses the same GDP and 
population growth rates as the Low Sink, but includes increased demand for woody 
biomass to meet bioenergy demands. The consumption levels are converted from 
Gigajoules to million m3 of forest biomass. The demand growth for pulpwood and 
Draft – Deliberative    47 
  
sawtimber is then adjusted to account for this new source of demand. Demand is 
adjusted by assuming 70%-30% split between pulpwood and sawtimber to meet the 
biomass for energy requirement. This increase in demand incentivizes near term 
increased forest management and afforestation in anticipation of higher market returns 
and increased forest biomass demand in the future. Thus, the projected forest net flux 
increases in the near term in forest management beyond the Low Sink scenario levels.   
  GTM High Sink: The GTM high sink scenario similarly adjusts pulpwood and 
sawtimber demand consistent with the Medium Sink scenario but also adds global 
carbon mitigation incentives that increase forest carbon sequestration. This approach 
combines the effect of increased investment in the forest sector driven by increased 
demand for biomass for energy with mitigation incentives for enhancing forest carbon 
sequestration, and the net result is a higher net emissions flux relative to the Low and 
Medium sink scenarios (this approach is discussed in Baker et al., 2016).  
For the MCS analysis, GTM was run for 200 years at 10-year time steps, and relied on the global forest 
data, forest yield growth information and carbon modeling approach described in the main body of this 
report.

Addendum B. Algebraic Structure of the Harvest Decision Making 
This section provides a general algebraic form of the Global Timber Model. GTM maximizes the 
present value of net welfare in the forestry sector. Net welfare is defined as the sum of consumers’ and 
producers’ surplus for timber markets that are derived from inverse timber demand functions and costs of 
managing and holding timberland. The costs of managing timberland include the costs of replanting 
timber and the costs of harvesting, accessing, and transporting timber. There is an opportunity cost of 
maintaining land in forests rather than switching to agriculture for crop cultivation and livestock grazing. 
We begin with the demand for wood. There are two demand functions in this model, one for 
sawtimber and one for pulpwood.  The inverse demand functions are formally written as, 
𝑃𝑃 =  𝐷 (𝑄𝑝;𝐵 ,𝑌)       (1.1a) 
𝑡 𝑝 𝑡 𝑡 𝑡
𝑃𝑆 =  𝐷 (𝑄𝑠;𝐵 ,𝑌)        (1.1b) 
𝑡 𝑠 𝑡 𝑡 𝑡
Where 𝑃𝑃 is the price of pulpwood and 𝑃𝑆is the price of sawtimber. The demand for either type of wood 
𝑡 𝑡
shifts is a function of the quantity of wood harvested, income, Y (or a composite for all other goods) and 
t
the demand for biomass energy, B. In our model, the demand for biomass will be 0 in the reference 
t
scenario, but positive in policy scenarios. The objective function of the optimization model can be written 
formally as: 
∞ 𝑄𝑝∗ 𝑄𝑠∗
max ∑𝜌𝑡{∫ 𝑡 𝐷 (𝑄𝑝;𝐵 ,𝑌) 𝑑𝑄𝑝+∫ 𝑡 𝐷 (𝑄𝑠;𝐵 ,𝑌)𝑑𝑄𝑠 −C (𝑞𝑖,𝑘,𝑚,𝑛,𝑋𝑗,𝑙)

Table  describes indexes, variables, functions, and parameters in the social planner’s problem (1.2).  The 
maximization problem (1.2) is constrained such that each age class and forest type is a stock variable 
which is allowed to adjust over time due to harvesting, replanting, and land conversion. All choice 
variables are constrained to be nonnegative, while area of timber harvested is not allowed to exceed the 
total timber area (See: Sohngen et al. [2016] for formal description of underlying algebraic model).

The model solution determines how much to harvest in each age class (a) and time period

𝑎=1,𝑡
plantations to establish,  𝑁𝑛.

𝑖,𝑗,𝑘,𝑙,𝑚,𝑛
Total timber area in each age class 𝑎 and type, 𝑋 , is a stock variable and adjusts over 
𝑎,𝑡
time according to equations (1.3i) through (1.3n). Initial stocks must be given (equation 1.4), and all 
choice variables are constrained to be greater than or equal to zero (equation 1.5). The area of timber 
harvesting does not exceed the total timber area (equation 1.6). 
Equation (1.7) shows that each inaccessible type in temperate and boreal zones is linked to a 
semi-accessible type. The semi-accessible types start with no forest area. When inaccessible forests are 
accessed, the hectares are converted to a similar semi-accessible type. Thus, the total area of inaccessible 
and semi-accessible forest area in each i remains constant over the scenario time horizon. Thus, an 
implicit assumption in temperate and boreal regions is that the opportunity costs of converting land in 
inaccessible/semi-accessible regions is 0 and thus that the rental costs are 0. 
In addition, equation (1.8) implies that each inaccessible type in the tropics also has a similar 
semi-accessible type associated with it; however as noted above, forestland is allowed to exit forestry in 
this region. Therefore, the area regenerated in these regions may be less than or more than the area 
harvested or removed in any period. There are two reasons why forests may be accessed in tropical 
regions, either due to timber demand or demand for land conversion. The demand for land conversion is 
driven by the rental functions, which generally are shifting inward and upward in tropical regions 
(representing increasing demand for land use in agriculture). Equations (1.9) and (1.10) are the equations 
of motion for management in forest type “i” and “n” in which forests are moderately and intensively 
managed, respectively. 
Forest yields (volume per hectare) are given as 𝑉𝑖 . The yield function measures the volume in 
𝑎,𝑡
each age class 𝑎 and type i at time 𝑡 all dependent on the management intensity for type 𝑖 at time t. The 
functional form for the yield function is: 
  𝑉𝑖 (Z𝑖 )= ℎ∗[exp(𝛿𝑖 −𝜋𝑖)].  (1.11)

Draft – Deliberative    53 
  
The functional forms for other types (j, k, l, m, n) are the same, although the parameters will 
differ. Yield is calculated by the stocking density, ℎ, where ℎ = 𝜑𝑖(1+Z𝑖 )𝜏𝑖, which can be adjusted 
𝑎,𝑡
depending on the intensity of management, 𝑍𝑖 . Stocking elasticity, τ, is restricted to be positive and 
𝑎=1,𝑡
less than 1and affects the elasticity of management inputs in forestry to account for technology change. 
Initial stocking is denoted by 𝜑𝑖. The model chooses management intensity by optimally choosing 
management intensity

The model will endogenously shift wood into either pulpwood or sawtimber uses, depending on prices, 
harvesting costs, and marginal user costs. Total harvested trees are valued for either pulpwood or 
sawtimber in markets. Biomass energy can be derived either from sawtimber harvests or pulpwood 
harvests.  We assume that the biomass demand shifts both demand functions out.  We do not formally 
track the quantity of biomass energy demanded in this model 
𝑖,𝑗,𝑘,𝑙,𝑚
The form of equation (1.12) is applicable for types j, k, l, m, n.  The term 𝜆  is the 
𝑠
𝑖,𝑗,𝑘,𝑙,𝑚
proportion of timber harvested for sawnwood, and 𝜆  is the proportion of wood harvested for

As noted above, the model has two types of market-valued wood: sawtimber and pulpwood, each 
with its own downward-sloping demand function. The functional forms of the inverse demand functions 
are shown in equation (1.16), where Y is the quantity of other goods consumed (e.g., GDP), B is the 
t t
quantity of biomass demanded by markets, fp is a function that converts the component of biomass

Other costs included in the model for forests and land use are: the costs of harvesting, accessing, 
and transporting timbers to mills, the costs of collecting residues to be used for biofuels, the costs of 
regenerating forests including new plantations, and the opportunity costs of holding timberland. This is 
formally derived and explained in Sohngen et al. (2016).  
Draft – Deliberative    54 
  
The model includes many costs of forests and land use, including a) costs of harvesting, 
accessing, and transporting timbers to mills; b) costs of collecting residues to be used for biofuels; 
c) costs of regenerating forests including new plantation; and d) (opportunity) costs of holding 
timberland. First, equations (1.17) through (1.19) show that costs of harvesting, accessing, and 
transporting for sawtimber, pulpwood, and biomass are the following functional forms, respectively, 
where 𝑀𝐶 (.) are the marginal cost functions in equations (1.19) and (1.20). The forms of equations 
𝑠,𝑝
(1.19) and (1.20) are also applicable for types k and m: 
  C (𝑞𝑖,𝑘,𝑚,𝑋𝑗,𝑙)= ∑ 𝜆𝑖[∫𝑞𝑡𝑖∗𝑀𝐶 (𝑞𝑖)𝑑𝑞𝑖]+ ∑ 𝜆𝑘[∫𝑞𝑡𝑘∗𝑀𝐶 (𝑞𝑘)𝑑𝑞𝑘]

  𝑀𝐶 (𝑞𝑖)= 𝛼𝑖 +𝛽𝑖(𝑞𝑖)𝛽𝑝𝑖−1  (1.20) 
𝑝 𝑡 𝑝 𝑝 𝑡
Second, in addition to using pulpwood and sawtimber for biofuels, the model allows the use of 
forest residues for pulpwood. These residues are set to be collected from accessible timberlands. They are 
material that is left on the forest floor after timber is harvested. Typically this material is called slash and 
it is left on site. Sometimes it is collected into piles and burned. At other times, it is just left to 
decompose. It is assumed that some of this material can be collected and used for pulpwood, where the 
costs of collecting this material are modeled as: 
  𝑅𝐸𝑆𝐶𝑂𝑆𝑇(𝑄𝑟𝑒𝑠)= 𝑐𝑎+𝑐𝑏𝑄𝑟𝑒𝑠 +𝑐𝑐(𝑄𝑟𝑒𝑠)2, where  (1.21) 
𝑡 𝑡 𝑡
  𝑄𝑟𝑒𝑠 ≤ 0.3∗0.5 𝑄 .  (1.22) 
𝑡 𝑡
In equation (1.22), 0.3 is the proportion of total forest yield that is forest residues, and 0.5 is the 
proportion of forest residues that can be removed from the stand. 
Third, the costs of regenerating forests (including new plantation) are given as: 
  𝑃𝐿𝐴𝑁𝑇𝐶 (𝐺𝑖,𝑘,𝑚,𝑛,𝑁𝑛,𝑍𝑖,𝑘,𝑚,𝑛)= ∑ 𝑍𝑖 𝐺𝑖 +∑ 𝑍𝑛 (𝐺𝑛+𝑁𝑛)+𝑒𝑛𝑁𝑛 
𝑡 𝑡 𝑡 𝑎=1,𝑡 𝑖 𝑎=1,𝑡 𝑡 𝑛 𝑎=1,𝑡 𝑡 𝑡 𝑡
  +∑ 𝑍𝑘 𝐺𝑘 +∑ (𝑍𝑚 +2000)𝐺𝑚,  (1.23) 
𝑘 𝑎=1,𝑡 𝑡 𝑚 𝑎=1,𝑡 𝑡
where 𝑍𝑖,𝑘,𝑚,𝑛 is the value of initial management intensity at age class one only, which is calculated by a 
𝑎=1,𝑡
unit of management intensity at only age class one times constant price r (Sedjo and Lyon, 1990); 𝑒𝑛 is 
the marginal cost of establishing new hectares of plantation. The costs of establishing new plantations in 
fast-growing types are assumed to be fairly high because these forests are highly valuable, and they 
require substantial site preparation efforts to obtain such high growth rates. 
Draft – Deliberative    55 
  
For the accessible/semi-accessible type of forests (types i, k, and m), they are assumed to have 
only regenerating trees, 𝐺𝑖,𝑘,𝑚, and new plantation area 𝑁𝑛 is assumed to be only in type n. For 
𝑡 𝑡
𝑗,𝑙 𝑗,𝑙
inaccessible types j and l, which are low-value trees, both 𝐺  𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑁  are assumed to be zero. 
𝑡 𝑡
Fourth, the opportunity costs of holding timberland rather than using it as agricultural land to 
grow crops or livestock are represented by a rental cost function, 𝑅𝐸𝑁𝑇 (X 𝑖,𝑙,𝑚,𝑛). Inaccessible and 
𝑡 𝑎,𝑡
semi-accessible lands in the temperate and boreal regions are assumed to have zero rental costs. This 
assumption is consistent with the internally generated bare land value returns calculated by the model for 
forest types in these regions. Rental costs are given as functions that increase as more land is added to the 
forestry area: 
1 1
  𝑅𝐸𝑁𝑇 (X 𝑖,𝑙,𝑚,𝑛)= ∑ [A𝑖{∑ 𝑋𝑖 }𝜂𝑖]+∑ [A𝑛{∑ 𝑋𝑛 }𝜂𝑛]+∑ [−z𝑙,𝑚{∑ 𝑋𝑙,𝑚} +

Addendum C: Algebraic Structure of the Carbon Modeling  
This section describes how carbon is calculated in the Global Timber Model. As previously 
mentioned methods for calculating carbon follow the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 
Good Practice Guidance (Penman et al., 2003). Carbon is tracked in four basic pools: aboveground 
carbon, slash, marketed products, and soils. Aboveground carbon is calculated on any given hectare in the 
model as: 
  𝐶𝑎𝑟𝑏𝑖 = [𝑉𝑖 (Z𝑖 )]∗ [𝑊𝐷𝑖]∗[𝐵𝐸𝐹𝑖]∗[𝑅𝑖]∗[𝐶𝐹𝑖].  (1.25) 
𝑎,𝑡 𝑎,𝑡 𝑎,𝑡
The variables shown in equation (1.25) are described in Table 3. The parameters are obtained from 
various sources, including Penman et al. (2003). To determine total carbon in a given timber type, the 
hectares in each age class are summed as follows: 
  𝑇𝐶𝑎𝑟𝑏𝑖 = ∑ [𝐶𝑎𝑟𝑏𝑖 ]∗[𝐻𝑖 ]  (1.26) 
𝑡 𝑎 𝑎,𝑡 𝑎,𝑡
Total carbon for all timber types can be determined by further summing across timber types, i. 
The slash pool contains dead timber left in the forest after harvests or land use conversion. It is 
material that is not removed due to high cost. If residues are harvested due to high demand, it is removed 
from this pool. However, in other cases slash is either burned by landowners or left to decompose. To 
calculate the amount of slash left in the forest at the time of harvest or land use conversion, the amount of 
carbon removed from harvesting of timber or other products is deducted from initial forest carbon 
amounts.  
Carbon in the slash pool is the dead timber left in forests after harvests or land use conversion. 
Slash is the material that is not used for marketed wood products and is too costly to remove from the 
forest. If residue is harvested, it is harvested from this pool. In some cases, slash is burned by landowners, 
and in other cases, slash is simply left behind to decompose. To calculate the amount of slash left in the 
forest at the time of timber harvest or land use conversion, the initial amount of carbon in forests is 
calculated in (1.27) and the amount removed for timber or other products is deducted. This is: 
  𝐴𝑛𝑛𝑆𝑙𝑎𝑠ℎ𝑖 = [𝑇𝐶𝑎𝑟𝑏𝑖]−[𝑀𝑘𝑡𝑖],  (1.27) 
𝑡 𝑡 𝑡
where 𝑀𝑘𝑡𝑖 is the amount of carbon stored in marketed products. The slash pool is composed of the 
𝑡
annual contribution to slash minus decomposition from previous years: 
  𝑆𝑙𝑎𝑠ℎ𝑃𝑜𝑜𝑙𝑖 = 𝑆𝑙𝑎𝑠ℎ𝑃𝑜𝑜𝑙𝑖 +𝐴𝑛𝑛𝑆𝑙𝑎𝑠ℎ𝑖 −𝑑𝑟𝑖[𝑆𝑙𝑎𝑠ℎ𝑃𝑜𝑜𝑙𝑖].  (1.28) 
𝑡+1 𝑡 𝑡 𝑡
Decomposition rates, 𝑑𝑟𝑖, range from 3% per year in boreal regions to 7% per year in tropical regions. 
Because the slash pool is built up over many years, at the start of the simulations the initial-year harvests 
is used to calculate an initial slash pool for each timber type i. This calculation will affect the baseline rate 
of slash accumulation, but it will not alter the change in slash accumulation in the policy scenarios. 
Market carbon is calculated similarly, although we account for differences in sawtimber and 
pulpwood. Methodologically, however, annual contributions to the sawtimber and pulpwood pools are 
calculated similarly: 
Draft – Deliberative    57 
  
Annual sawtimber market carbon: 𝑆𝑀𝑘𝑡𝑖 = [𝑐𝑎𝑟𝑚𝑖]∑ {λ𝑖  [𝑉𝑖 (Z𝑖 )] [𝐻𝑖 ]}  (1.29) 
𝑡 𝑎 𝑎,𝑡 𝑎,𝑡 𝑎,𝑡 𝑎,𝑡
Annual pulpwood market carbon: 𝑃𝑀𝑘𝑡𝑖 = [𝑐𝑎𝑟𝑚𝑖]∑ {[1−λ𝑖 ] [𝑉𝑖 (Z𝑖 )] [𝐻𝑖 ]}  (1.30) 
𝑡 𝑎 𝑎,𝑡 𝑎,𝑡 𝑎,𝑡 𝑎,𝑡
Some of the carbon in the marketed product pools is assumed to turn over, or decompose, and is released 
to the atmosphere each year. The equations for keeping track of this process is given as: 
  𝑆𝑎𝑤𝑃𝑜𝑜𝑙𝑖 = 𝑆𝑎𝑤𝑃𝑜𝑜𝑙𝑖 +(1−𝛾𝑖)𝑆𝑀𝑘𝑡𝑖 −𝑑𝑟𝑤𝑖[𝑆𝑎𝑤𝑃𝑜𝑜𝑙𝑖]   (1.31) 
𝑡+1 𝑡 𝑠 𝑡 𝑠 𝑡
  𝑃𝑢𝑙𝑝𝑃𝑜𝑜𝑙𝑖 = 𝑃𝑢𝑙𝑝𝑃𝑜𝑜𝑙𝑖 +(1−𝛾𝑖)𝑃𝑀𝑘𝑡𝑖 −𝑑𝑟𝑤𝑖[𝑃𝑢𝑙𝑝𝑃𝑜𝑜𝑙𝑖]  (1.32) 
𝑡+1 𝑡 𝑝 𝑡 𝑝 𝑡
In equations (1.31) and (1.32), some proportion, usually 25 to 35% of the amount harvested is emitted 
relatively quickly in the production process. This emission often occurs in the form of harvesting residues 
that are burned for energy or discarded immediately. Wood products then enter useful products and 
eventually are discarded. They are assumed to decompose over time at rate 𝑑𝑟𝑤𝑖 . 
𝑠,𝑝
Soil carbon is maintained in three separate stocks. The first stock is for forests maintained as 
forests. If forests do not change land use, soil stocks are constant. When land use changes, such as from 
forest to nonforest or vice versa, the model calculates the net gain or loss in carbon to or from the 
atmosphere. This is accomplished by tracking the total pool of soil carbon in forests but only deducting 
the net losses when forests are converted to agriculture. 
The second stock of soil carbon is for soils that have converted from agriculture to forests. These 
soils begin with an average amount of carbon in soils for the given region and then accumulate carbon in 
soils over time. The pool of soil carbon accumulates over time according to a logistic growth function, 
with growth rate rri. Ki is the steady-state soil carbon potential for each timber type: 
  𝑆𝑜𝑖𝑙𝐶𝑖 = 𝑆𝑜𝑖𝑙𝐶𝑖 +𝑓(𝑆𝑜𝑖𝑙𝐶𝑖)  (1.33) 
𝑡+1 𝑡 𝑡
where 
  𝑓(𝑆𝑜𝑖𝑙𝐶𝑖) = (𝑟𝑟𝑖)(𝑆𝑜𝑖𝑙𝐶𝑖)[𝐾𝑖−𝑆𝑜𝑖𝑙𝐶𝑡𝑖].  (1.34) 
𝑡 𝑡 𝑆𝑜𝑖𝑙𝐶𝑖
𝑡
The third stock of soil carbon is the soil carbon associated with land use conversions out of 
forests and into agriculture. When these changes occur, the present value of carbon lost over time is 
calculated using equation 1.34, and these present value losses or gains are assigned to the hectares that are 
removed from forestry (or added to forestry) in the year the land use changes. This simplifies the need to 
account for the carbon in hectares after they have exited the model, and it results in a relatively 
conservative net estimate of the carbon losses when land is converted out of forest.

Appendix E: Model Documentation for the U.S. Forest Assessment Model as Applied for the U.S. 
Mid-Century Strategy for Deep Decarbonization  
John W. Coulston11  & David N. Wear12 
Introduction 
Recent evaluations of forest carbon dynamics in the US (Woodall et al. 2015; EPA 2016) and projections 
of future greenhouse gas emissions (BR 2016, Wear and Coulston 2015) indicate that forest carbon 
sequestration continues to provide a strong net offset to emissions from other sectors but that the offset is 
expected to decline due to land use pressures, management, forest aging, and other biophysical dynamics.  
These projections generally anticipate future forest carbon sequestration without policy interventions that 
could increase sink strength. We evaluate the potential for policies in the forest sector to contribute 
additionally to reductions in U.S. emission futures.  By examining an additive and plausible set of 
scenarios for expanding forest carbon sequestration between 2017 and 2050 we set out the potential upper 
bounds on future offsets. 
Our scenarios address a set of policy targets measured in terms of forest area and harvested forest 
products consistent with land use/management options that could influence forest carbon dynamics and 
that have some historical precedent. While we do not model the market mechanisms for achieving these 
physical outputs—i.e., subsidies, carbon cap and trade or tax strategies—the broad context for these 
projections is a future with a high cost placed on carbon emissions that would encourage increased 
sequestration and decreased emission activities. Given the complexity of the biophysical dynamics that 
ultimately govern how these activities influence carbon sequestration, defining the potential range of 
responses defines a critical first step before pursuing a more nuanced design of policy mechanisms—i.e., 
through taxes, cap and trade programs, etc... 
Carbon sequestration in the forest sector results from the net effects of carbon accumulations in and 
emissions from standing forests, land use changes, harvested wood products in use, and landfills, with the 
largest share (~85%) accruing to standing forests where carbon accumulation has long exceeded the 
emissions from harvesting and disturbances such as fire.  Land use changes have resulted in concurrent 
gains and losses in forest area with net gains accruing in the US over the past twenty years. Projections of 
forest carbon developed for the 2016 US Biennial Report by USDA (USDA OCE 2015) included a 
reference scenario that anticipates the elimination of net gains in forestland in the next decade followed 
by a slight decline in forest area through 2050. The combined effects of projected land use changes, 
market-clearing production of various wood products, and forest growth dynamics and disturbances result 
in an overall slowing of carbon sequestration rates by the forest sector. This reference scenario defines the 
reference case for weighing a range of policy options.

Future Scenarios 
Three human interventions dominate changes in the forest sector: land use choices, forest management 
and harvesting, and fire/fuel management.  Accordingly, we consider three possible mechanisms for 
enhancing forest C sequestration in the United States: 1) altering the area of forests by reducing land 
development or by encouraging afforestation on other rural land uses or by restoring persistently 
nonstocked forest areas (areas in a forest land use without tree cover), 2) forest management efforts to 
reduce the occurrence of wildfire, 3) expanding the use of solidwood products or bioenergy products from 
forests.  We construct and evaluate the following additive set of scenarios to determine a plausible range 
of sequestration futures for the US: 
1.  Reduced deforestation.  Current USDA projections anticipate land development in response to a 
growing US population and economy. This scenario—an alternative projection developed for the 
Biennial Report (USDA OCE 2015)—anticipates a shift toward lower development intensities 
that result in no net loss of forest area beginning in 2025.  
2.  Afforestation/reforestation.  We evaluate expanded forest area for a high and a low policy case.  
In the eastern US we simulate the effects of an afforestation program of between 10 (low) and 30 
(high) million acres.  Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) already funds the “retirement” of 
private marginal cropland to support conservation efforts and the cap on the program has reached 
as high as 36.8 million acres and currently stands at about 24 million acres. This scenario 
anticipates a similar program (perhaps an extension of the current CRP) to compensate 
landowners for establishing forests in the eastern US on other rural lands.  Additionally, the 
nation’s forest inventory includes areas that remain persistently understocked in trees in western 
regions-- 13.0 million acres with 9.2 million located on federal forests.  Forest regeneration could 
be focused through public agencies and this scenario simulates the influence of reforestation on 
80 (high) percent or 50 (low) percent of these 9.2 million acres. 
3.  Fire mitigation.  Wildfire causes carbon emissions and lateral transfer of carbon among pools 
followed by recapture of carbon by growing forests.  This scenario simulates a 10 percent 
reduction in fire occurrence throughout the US by reducing the rate of stand-replacing fire events 
by 10% and then adjusting carbon among forest pools consistent with observed fire/no fire 
distributions in the inventory (e.g., shifts from live to dead tree pools) 
4.  Expanded Wood Construction.  Solid wood products provide a means of storing carbon 
captured by growing forests for several decades. While the U.S. consumes more wood per capita 
than any other nation, the use of solidwood products could be expanded.  This scenario evaluates 
increases in the wood product content of construction by 10 percent on carbon stored in forests 
and in the wood products. 
5.  Bioenergy.  We simulate the effect of bioenergy futures (developed by the Department of 
Energy) on forest carbon futures. Current bioelectricity capacity is 414 MW.  The biomass 
scenario targets a doubling of this capacity every 10-years from 2025 to 2055 such that in 2055 
the total capacity is 3312 MW.  Under this scenario we assume that forest energy crops will 
contribute 50% each to meeting increased demand.  This suggest increases forest bioenergy crops 
from approximately 1 million acres currently to 6.7 million acres in 2050.  We present the results 
of the bioenergy scenario separate from scenarios 1-4 described above.   
61 
  
Our core analysis focuses on constructing scenarios in additive fashion (table 1).  We start with the 
reduced deforestation scenario, then add afforestation/restoration, then add fire mitigation, then add 
expanded wood construction options.  To examine the influence of policy timing, we also examine a 
scenario that defers the implementation of the afforestation/restoration policy by five years.   
The bioenergy scenario is held separate from our core analyses.  Increased acreage of forest bioenergy 
plantations is assumed to come from under-utilized pasturelands and increases are staged to meet energy 
sector demands.  Because the system is designed to meet these increased demands it is at a steady state 
(emissions=sequestration) after year 2055.   
Subsequent to evaluating the incremental scenarios we construct a scenario that defines a more aggressive 
afforestation policy and spreads out afforestation and restoration across a longer time frame with the 
objective of defining some approximation of an upper bound for potential sequestration. We augment the 
high afforestation level of 30 million additional acres in the East with another 5 million acres in the East 
and 10 million acres in the West for a total of 45 million acres. We label this the Target 2050 scenario 
and it also includes the fire mitigation and expanded wood construction elements described above.

Results  
Reduced Development: 
Our results suggest that policy intervention can significantly influence both the trajectory of annual C 
sequestration rates and the cumulative amount of C sequestered by forests between 2017 and 2050 (Table 
2).  For example under the reference scenario the annual forest C sequestration rate was projected to be -
323 Tg CO -eq yr-1 in 2050. A policy aimed at reducing deforestation (no net change in forest area) may 
2
increase the annual forest sequestration rate to -362 Tg CO -eq yr-1.  From a cumulative perspective our 
2
results show that, compared to the reference scenario (-14103 Tg CO -eq), the reduced deforestation 
2
scenario sequesters 1127 Tg CO -eq  of additional carbon from 2017-2050.

Figure 1.  (A) Annual forest carbon sequestration (Tg CO2 eq yr-1), and (B) cumulative sequestration 
(Tg CO2 eq) over the simulation period relative to the reference case. Note that these charts reflect carbon 
sequestered in the forest carbon pool alone and do not reflect associated changes in the harvested wood 
products carbon pool. 
Afforestation and restoration: 
The afforestation/restoration scenarios in combination with the reduced deforestation scenario showed 
further increases over the reference scenario with the ‘high’ option increasing annual sequestration to -
469 to -480 Tg CO -eq yr-1 in 2050 depending whether the implementation was immediate or deferred 
2
(table 2).  Deferred implementation yielded greater sequestration rates in 2050 but the cumulative 
sequestration between 2015-2050 was somewhat smaller for the deferred implementation (-3275 Tg CO -
2
eq) than with immediate implementation (-3818 Tg CO2-eq) compared with the reference scenario.  The 
reduced deforestation and the afforestation/restoration options also influences land use transfer of C.  
These transfers, while not interactions with the atmosphere, do move existing carbon stocks into forest 
from other land uses.  There were significant land use transfers associated with the low and high 
afforestation scenarios under the immediate and deferred options.  The restoration scenario did not cause 
an increase in land use transfer C because the perpetually non-stocked areas where restoration was 
targeted were classified as a forest land use. 
Fire mitigation: 
Because we were interested in the additive nature of the policy options the reduced fire scenario was 
added to the reduced deforestation, immediate implementation of the high and low 
afforestation/restoration scenarios.  The effect of this scenario was minimal in the east.  In the west 
however, the reduced fire scenario increased average annual sequestration rates by -7 to -11 Tg CO -eq

yr-1 and from a cumulative perspective the fire scenario increases carbon storage by -251  and -304 Tg 
CO -eq over the low immediate and high immediate afforestation/restoration options respectively.  There 
2
were significant lateral transfers associated with fires and while empirical evidence suggests a substantial 
decrease in the live tree carbon density (-7 Mg C ha-1) this was partially offset by substantial increases in 
dead tree carbon density (4 Mg C ha-1) (fig 3).  Further, the avoidance of fire modified age transition 
probabilities such that the ‘aging process’ increased (see methods).

the variability across western forest types. 
Expanded solidwood products: 
The expanded wood construction scenario was considered in addition to the reduced fire scenario.  The 
increased forest harvesting to support expanded wood products construction decreased forest 
sequestration rates by 15.2 Tg CO -eq yr-1 in 2050 and 25.6  Tg CO -eq yr-1 in 2030 as compared to the 
2 2
reduced fire scenario (Table 2).  However these decreases were offset by increases in the harvest wood 
products carbon pool.   
The reference harvested wood products scenario, develop from the US Forest Products Model, was 
aligned with the assumptions of the forest reference scenario.  Under the reference HWP scenario annual 
sequestration in harvested wood products increases from -112 Tg CO -eq yr-1 in 2015 to  -148 Tg CO -eq 
2 2
yr-1 in 2050 (Table 3).  Table 3 also depicts increases to the harvested wood products pool that were a 
result of the increased cutting to provide solidwood material.  Under this scenario from 2015-2050 
sequestration in the harvested wood products pool ranged from -23 to -30 Tg CO -eq yr-1 and the 
2
cumulative effect was 876 Tg CO -eq.  Results suggest that the increased solid wood construction 
2
scenario increases the overall harvest wood products pool sequestration to -171 Tg CO -eq yr-1 in 2050.  
2
When considering the entire forest sector (persisting forest, and harvested wood products carbon) the 
expanded solidwood products scenario increases sequestration by 8 Tg CO -eq yr-1 over the reduced 
2
development plus afforestation/restoration plus fire mitigation suppression scenario (Table 4).

Bioenergy: 
Under the bioenergy scenario, to accommodate the increased capacity of the electricity sector additional 
acres are needed for bioenergy plantations.  Assuming a 10-year rotation, the approximately one million 
ac in current bioenergy plantations would need to increase to about 6.7 million ac in 2050 and 8.2 million 
acres in 2055 to supply electricity sector (see methods).  These additional acres would be staged based on 
decadal increases in demand (Figure 4a).    Because the plantations are established 10 years before the 
supply is needed there is an increased sequestration from 2020-2055 (Figure 4b).  However after 2055 the 
system reaches a steady state and sequestration is zero Tg CO -eq yr-1.  Results from this scenario are not 
2
included in the other scenarios (reduced development, afforestation and restoration, fire management, 
increased solid wood products, or target 2050).

plantations (b).

Target 2050: 
Under the reference scenario sequestration rates declined by 21% between 2015 and 2050 (Figure 3).  Our 
most aggressive policy high/fire/HWP increased sequestration rates by 7% between 2015 and 2050.  The 
target2050 was devised to contemplate the magnitude of actions needed to significantly increase the forest 
sector sink in 2050.  We found that increasing the afforestation component by 15 million acres and 
adjusting the timing of afforestation/restoration increased forest sequestration rates by 26% (156.2 Tg 
CO -eq yr-1) between 2015 and 2050 (fig 3).  However because forest growth rates and hence 
2
sequestration are maximized at earlier stand ages, sequestration would decrease after 2050. 
 
Discussion 
Our reference scenario assumes no policy intervention over the projection period and suggests that forest 
sector carbon sequestration rates will decrease to -471 Tg CO  yr-1 by 2050 primarily due to the 
2
interaction of forest ageing, forest disturbance, and land use change.  Based on our analysis policies that 
modify these interacting drivers can increase sequestration during the projection period.  Retaining forest 
land addresses the expected loss of forest land through land use change but does not influence the forest 
aging process where older forests sequester less carbon.  Adding new forestland through an afforestation 
policy influences carbon through land use change, partially influences the ageing component and 
therefore the disturbance component.  However the afforestation policies, whether immediately 
implemented or deferred, cause a surge in sequestration as additional acreage moves through the most 
productive age classes but then subsides as the new forests mature.  This was similar for the restoration 
activities.  Regardless, adjusting the land use change component offered the largest incremental gains.  
Fire mitigation is both the most intractable and the least influential of strategies for enhancing sink 
strength for several reasons.  First, the implementation of this type of policy would be very difficult 
because it would require effective fire management/silvicultural treatments on an additional 0.7 million ac 
yr-1.  Second, fire is a natural part of many forest communities in the United States and particularly in the 
western United States fire often acts as a stand replacing event.  The stand replacing event however does 
not necessarily mean a complete emission of all material.  Rather lateral transfers between forest carbon 
pools result in retention of a significant portion of the carbon in the standing dead tree pool and these 
trees may decay quite slowly, particularly in arid and semi-arid climates, while the understory quickly 
responds and grows.  Third, reducing fire through mitigation allows the ageing process to continue for 
those areas where forest fire management was carried out and fire avoided.     
Under the most aggressive set of policies (avoided deforestation, high afforestation/restoration, fire 
mitigation, and expanded wood products) 30 million ac would be added to the forest land base of ~ 700 
million ac. In combination the forest management scenarios (restoration, fire mitigation, and expanded 
wood products) would influence less than 50 million acres of the ~730 million ac forest land base (7 
percent).   The target2050 scenario provides a more aggressive alternative still influences less than 9% of 
the projected forest land base.  It results in an increase in sequestration in 2050 but that increase subsides 
under observed forest dynamics.   
69 
  
There are important regional dynamics and the policy options implemented in the eastern United States 
had larger influences on both average sequestration rates (2017-2050) and cumulative sequestration rates 
than in the western United States.  This was primarily driven predominately by the higher growth rates of 
forest in the eastern United States. Also, the fire mitigation strategy was relatively ineffective in the East 
where its implementation only increased sequestration rates by ~ 2 Tg CO -eq yr-1.   
2
In summary, we implement 11 different scenarios to examine their possible impact on forest carbon 
sequestration rates as compared to a reference scenario.  Avoided deforestation in conjunction with a 
large area afforestation and restoration initiative provided the largest marginal gains.  The fire mitigation 
scenario had a comparatively minor influence of overall C dynamics.  The increased wood products 
scenario also had a comparatively minor increase in overall sequestration.  Aggressive policies to 
maximize forest sector CO  sequestration in 2050 were examined however, these scenarios do no provide 
2
for sustained CO  sequestration rates.  Examining cumulative sequestration over a prescribed period of 
2
time will provide a reasonable basis to judge the overall effectiveness of potential policies for increasing 
forest carbon sequestration.      
Methods 
Data 
We used inventory data as provided by the USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis program 
to quantify and project C stock and C stock change for the conterminous US.  These data were consistent 
with the data used in BR 2016 and Woodall et al. (2015).  Total carbon was used in this analysis and 
included the following pools:  down dead wood, forest floor, live trees above ground, live trees below 
ground, standing dead wood, soil organic C, understory vegetation above ground, and understory 
vegetation below ground.  Further details on C pool models are presented by Woodall et al. (2015). 
Projection models 
The forest component of the land use sector is one element of the national Greenhouse Gas Inventory and 
accumulation in forests involves transfers between forests and other land uses.  Area that is transitioned 
from a non-forest use to a forest use is included as an increase in the forest C pool while transition from 
forest to non-forest use is included as a loss from the forest pool.  Accordingly, net change in forest C 
includes both C exchange with the atmosphere and transfers to or from other terrestrial C pools. 
Additionally, some harvested forest C may be transferred to durable forest product C pools and this is 
accounted for as a separate component.  We decompose the total change in the forest C pool into a land 
transfer component and a forest growth component.  The latter provides an estimate of the net C exchange 
between forests and the atmosphere.  The FIA database provides State-level  estimates of net changes in 
forest area (ΔA),  total change in forest C (ΔC), and carbon densities by pool, including the average 
density of soil C (C )  We approximate the C transfer associated with net forest area change as ΔA● 
soil
C , and the C sequestered as:

Western projection model. In the western regions of the United States (Pacific and Rocky Mountain 
Regions in Fig. 1), where forest sampling is less intense and transition measures are not yet available, we 
70 
  
model changes in forest C using inventory aggregates and a stage-class forest population model 29.  
Consider the following general description of forest C inventory change: 
𝐶 = 𝑭 ∙𝑫𝒆𝒏  1 
𝑡 𝑡
where C  is total forest C at time t within the analysis area, F is a 1 x n vector of forest area by age class 
t 
(n is the number of age classes and the nth age class is a terminal age class, ideally defined where C 
reaches a stable maximum) and Den is an n x 1 vector of per unit area forest C densities arrayed by forest 
age class. Note that this can be generalized to account for multiple forest types or to distinguish among 
other relevant forest attributes (e.g., n=jk where j= the number of age classes and k=number of forest 
types). Inter-period forest C dynamics can be described by introduction of a transition matrix (T): 
𝑭 = 𝑭 ∙𝑻  2 
𝑡+𝑚 𝑡
where T is an n x n matrix and each element T  defines the proportion of forest area in class i 
ij
transitioning to class j and m defines the time increment of the projection.  The values of the elements of 
T depend on a number of factors, including forest disturbances such as harvests, fire, storms, and others, 
and the value of m, especially relative to the span of the age classes.  For example, consider a case where 
we hold area fixed, allow for no mortality, define the time step m equivalent to the span of age classes, 
and define five age classes.  T would be: 
0 0 0 0 0 3 
1 0 0 0 0
   
 𝑻 = 0 1 0 0 0  
   
0 0 1 0 0
(0 0 0 1 1)
where all forest area progresses to the next age class and forests within the terminal age class are retained 
forever.  With this version of T, after five time steps all forests would be in the terminal age class. 
Relaxing these assumptions changes the structure of T.  If we account for disturbances including 
harvesting and fire that result in stand regeneration and allow for stochastic elements in forest aging:

  2 3 3  
0 0 𝑡 1−𝑡 −𝑑 0
3 4 4
( 0 0 0 𝑡 1−𝑑 )
4 5
where t  is the proportion of forest of age class i transitioning to age class i+1, d is the proportion of age 
i i
class i that experiences a stand-replacing disturbance, and (1−t −d ) is the proportion retained within 
i i
age class i. 
Once T is specified, forest C at the end of the next period is defined as: 
C = 𝑭 ∙𝑻∙𝑫𝒆𝒏  5 
t+m 𝒕
And change in C is defined as: 
71 
  
∆𝐶 = 𝐶 −𝐶 =(𝑭 𝑻−𝑭 )∙𝑫𝒆𝒏  6 
𝑡 𝑡+𝑚 𝑡 𝑡 𝑡
We can also incorporate land use change as a 1 x n vector L with positive entries indicating increased 
forest area and negative entries indicating loss of forest area. 
∆C =C −C = (𝑭 𝑻−𝑭 )∙𝑫𝒆𝒏+𝑳 ∙𝑫𝒆𝒏  7

𝑭 = 𝑭 +𝑳    
𝒕+𝒎 𝒕 𝒕
We model change in the West at the State level except in California, Oregon, and Washington where we 
separate the states into areas on the western and eastern sides of the Cascade mountain divide due to vast 
differences in forest productivity.  For each State/substate we query the FIA inventory for all plot records 
to construct the C density vector (Den) by 5-year age classes from age 1-5 to greater than age 200.  We 
also include an age class with recorded age of 0, which is largely composed of forests classified as non-
stocked (where a land use change is not indicated by reforestation has yet to occur).  For each 
State/substate we also define the age class distribution for the current forest area (F ).  Non-stocked areas 
1
are treated separately in the simulations. For reference cases we assume that these forests persist in a non-
stocked condition, but also explore scenarios where some of these areas would be restored to a productive 
condition.  An average historical stand-replacing disturbance rate (d) is defined by dividing the area of 
i
forests currently in the 1-5 year age class by total forest area (excluding non-stocked area) multiplied by 
the average transition rate (t). We apply this as a constant disturbance rate across age classes---our 
assumption then is that the recent disturbance pattern leading to forest replacement carries into the future.  
Note that d includes all events that reset the stand age including fire, weather, insects, and harvesting. We 
define an age transition rate (t) of 0.85 for all age classes to complete the definition of the transition 
i
matrix T (equation 4).  
Simulations proceed by applying equation 7, using Den, F, and T matrices defined above and with areas 
of forest area change (L) defined by assumptions that vary by scenario.  For net gains in forest area we 
assume that new forest is added to the 1-5 year age class; for losses we remove forests proportionately 
across all age classes.    We calculate the C transfers associated with land use change assuming that the 
soil organic C component of the vector Den transfers to/from the outgoing/incoming land use.  Scenarios 
regarding future land use changes (incorporated in L), potential shifts in productivity (adjustments to the 
Den vector), and forest restoration activities (through the T matrix) drive a set of projections using these 
models.  Separate simulations are constructed for each of the 18 State/subState units and results are 
summarized for Pacific and Rocky Mountain Regions.  Model validation is conducted using the inverse 
of T (𝑭 = 𝑭 𝑻−𝟏) and historical land use change to backcast F, C, and dC based on equations 5-7.

Eastern projection model. Projection models for the eastern regions of the US (South and North regions 
in Fig. 1) utilize remeasured inventory plots. The preceding formulation of C inventory change is based 
on simulated forest type/age transitions and average C densities for given ages. A higher degree of 
specificity can be defined if we decompose the forest in a way that accounts for the effects of specific 
forest disturbances and other dynamics recorded for remeasured inventory plots.   Consider the following 
modification to equation [7]:   
72 
  
∆C =F ∙δC  9 
t t
Where ∆C is total forest C change within the analysis area, F is as previously defined; δC is an n x 1 
vector of per unit area forest C stock change per year arrayed by forest age class. Inter-period forest C 
dynamics are described as in equation [2] but the age transition matrix (T) is estimated from the observed 
data directly.  Forest C change at the end of the next period is defined as: 
∆𝐶 = 𝑭 ∙𝑻∙𝜹𝑪  10 
𝑡+𝑚 𝑡
We incorporate land use change and cutting, fire, weather, and insects/diseases disturbances by 
generalizing equation [10] to account for the above change vectors and undisturbed forest remaining as 
undisturbed forest:  
11 
∆𝐶 = ∑(𝑨 ∙𝑻 ∙𝜹𝑪 ) 
𝑡+𝑚 𝑡𝑑 𝒅 𝒅
𝑑∈𝐿
where A is the area by age class of each mutually exclusive land category in L.  L is (FF, NFF, FNF, F , 
cut
F , F , F ) where FF=undisturbed forest remaining as undisturbed forest, NFF=non-forest to forest 
fire weather id
conversion, FNF=forest to non-forest conversion,  F =cut forest remaining as forest, F =forest 
cut fire
remaining as forest disturbed by fire, F =forest remaining as forest disturbed by weather, and 
weather
F =forest remaining as forest disturbed by insects and diseases .  When more than one disturbance occurs 
id
on a plot a dominant disturbance is assigned with cutting dominating when it occurs.  Otherwise, the 
disturbance associated with the greatest tree mortality is assigned.  In the case of land transfers (FNF and 
NFF), T is an n x n identity matrix and δC is a C stock transfer rate by age. Paired measurements for all 
plots in the inventory provide direct estimates of all elements of 𝜹𝑪,𝑻 ,and 𝑨  matrices.  Scenarios are 
𝒅 𝒕𝒅
implemented by adjusting 𝑨  for the NFF and FNF categories. Productivity shifts are implemented as 
𝒕𝒅
adjustments to C stock transfer rates in 𝜹𝑪 .

Scenario implementation 
Reduced deforestation 
Current trends from the FIA data suggest that forest area has been increase xx and xx ha per year in the 
east and west respectively.  To implement the reduced deforestation in the west F was modified for each 
t 
m time step as to maintain the xx increase per year until 2025.  Subsequently F remained constant.  In the 
t 
east, A  was modified for the NFF and FNF categories was modified in a similar fashion.  The δC was 
td
assumed to remain constant for NFF and FNF categories.   
Afforestation/restoration 
Forest restoration was implemented in the western United States. To implement this scenario, F was 
t
augmented by adding a portion of the persistently nonstocked component of the forest inventory in 
western states over a ten year period (portion and timing of the transfer was defined by the scenario).  
Because nonstocked areas are included in the forest land use, restoration does not affect any transfers of 
carbon associated with land use change. 
73 
  
The afforestation scenario was implemented in the eastern United States.  To implement this scenario A  
td
was modified for the NFF category such that the requisite area transition into forest and the requisite time 
period.  The simulation future afforestation was assumed to follow the same dynamics as observed 
afforestation in terms of area by age class distribution and carbon density by age class. 
Fire management 
The fire management scenario was implemented by decreasing the amount of fire by 10%.  This focused 
on reducing the extent of fire not classified as ‘ground fire’ in the FIA database.  In the east this was 
implemented by modifying 𝑨  for the F category described above.  To implement this scenario in the 
𝒕𝒅 fire 
west we extended the methodologies suggested in Woodall et al. (2015).  Based on an analysis of the FIA 
data the amount of C stored in areas that have recently burned is C =F ∙Den  where F is forest area 
fire fire fire
and Den is carbon density by pool.  Likewise in area without fire C =F ∙Den .  To implement a 10% 
fire’ fire’ fire’
reduction in fire C =0.9∙F ∙Den .  This causes and increase to C =(((1-0.9) ∙F )+F ) ∙Den .  
fireR fire fire fire’R fire fire’ fire’
The original C stock was C=C +C .  C stocks under reduced fire were C =C +C .  This model 
fire fire’ R fireR fire’R
was implemented on a forest type basis and Den was recalculated as Den =Den◦C ◦C-1.  T was also 
R R
modified yielding T  such that there was 10% less disturbance affecting age transitions. 
R
Wood products carbon 
The wood product carbon scenario required tracking increases to the wood products pools and increases 
in forest cutting required to meet the requisite increase in wood products carbon.  The target increase was 
8.3 Tg C yr-1 going into structural wood products used in construction.  We developed a model to predict 
the area of forest cutting (A ) based on carbon ending up in wood products (P).  This was required 
cut
because only a portion of the carbon removed from the forest becomes a product (Skog 2008).  When 
parametrizing this model we assumed that increased cutting would occur in the Southern region of the 
United States because of its strong forest industry infrastructure.  The model was  
𝑃−𝑚
𝐴 = +𝑒  
𝑐𝑢𝑡 𝑏∙𝛿̅̅𝐶̅̅𝑐̅̅𝑢̅̅𝑡
Where A  was the area of forest cutting in the Southern US, P was wood products carbon in products, m 
cut
was an estimated parameter for wood products carbon produced outside of the Southern region, b was an 
estimated parameter for the ratio wood products carbon produced from Southern forests to forest carbon 
stock change from cutting in the Southern region, 𝛿̅̅𝐶̅̅̅̅̅ was average carbon stock change per unit area 
𝑐𝑢𝑡
from cutting, and e was error. Because the scenario suggests that the 10% increase in P will be in the 
structural lumber pools we targeted increased cutting in the 25-40 age classes.  To solve for A  under a 
cut
10% increase in P and targeting the 25-40 year age classes we iteratively solved for A  by recalculating 
cut
𝛿̅̅𝐶̅̅̅̅̅ to target the requisite age classes.  This was necessary because forests of different age classes 
𝑐𝑢𝑡
generally have differ stock densities and harvesting practices (e.g. clearcut vs. partial-cut).  Increasing the 
area in specific age classes changes 𝛿̅̅𝐶̅̅̅̅̅.  Given the A  estimate for harvest in the 25-40 year classes 
𝑐𝑢𝑡 cut
we modified 𝑨  for the F category described above. 
𝒕𝒅 cut 
We used the decay model provided by IPCC 2006 to model the additional C entering the harvested wood 
products pool.   
H=e-k*H +[(1-e-k)/k]*prod  
i i-1 i-1
74 
  
Where, K is based on the half-life of various products=ln(2)/halflife, Prod=production, H= harvested 
wood products carbon, i=year.  Because the increase production was assumed to provide material for 
structural building we used the halflife for material in single family homes (78 yrs).  Stock change in H 
was then H-H .

Bioenergy 
Current bioelectricity capacity is 414 MW.  The biomass scenario targets a doubling of this capacity 
every 10-years from 2025 to 2055 such that in 2055 the total capacity is 3312 MW.  Assuming 
approximately 1.5 green tons of biomass per MWh this suggests that the current electricity sector demand 
for biomass from energy crops is approximately 5 million green tons per year.  Under a decadal doubling 
of capacity this suggest that approximately 40 million green tons per year are needed in 2055 supplied 
half from agricultural land and half from forestland.  We further assume that these additional acres of 
forestland will come from pastureland.   
Forest bioenergy planation crops considered are Populus Sp., Salix Sp., and Liriodendron tulipfera.  We 
examined the FIA database (http://www.fia.fs.fed.us/library/database-documentation/index.php) for 
young plantations (0-15 year) where these species were planted.  Above ground carbon stocks (C ) by 
ag
age are presented in table x.  We assume that dry tons of biomass are half of green tons biomass and that 
carbon is half of dry tons of biomass.  Based on a portion of the literature, the rotation ages for these 
plantations range from 5-13 years (Miller and Bender 2012, Zamora et al. 2013, Zalesney et al. 2011, 
Berguson et al. 2010).

To accommodate the increased capacity of the electricity sector in this scenario additional acres are 
needed for bioenergy plantations.  Given the range of rotation ages for these plantation we assumed a 10 
year rotation.  We employed the Wear and Coulston (2015) modeling framework to project carbon 
dynamics associated with this scenario.  We only consider dynamics in the above ground live pool.  The 
additional acreages were assumed to enter the system at age zero and the model was run on a yearly time-
step.  We track net forest sequestration (total sequestration-harvest) and biomass harvest.

SECTION 2 APPENDIX. LAND USE FUTURES 
The forest other land use projections used for this analysis are derived from previous work for two USDA 
Assessments which have examined change in resource conditions based in part on expected changes in 
land uses across the United States.  One is the 2010 RPA Assessment, designed to provide 50-year 
projections for all regions of the CONUS.  For this assessment, we modeled land use change driven by 
different scenarios regarding growth in and distributions of population and income across the US derived 
from the IPCC A1B, A2, and B2 storylines.  In addition, the “USDA Integrated Projections for 
Agriculture and Forest Sector Land Use, Land-Use Change, and GHG Emissions and Removals” provides 
an integrated assessment of forest carbon futures based in part on land use projections using a 
methodology based on a national-level model that extrapolates rates of change for a reference case and 
alternatives with higher and lower rates of urbanization. The two assessments project changes in forest 
and cropland using different approaches.  The USDA Assessment uses USDA Agricultural projections to 
predict future cropland and links change in forest area to recent (15-year) observed rates of change.  The 
RPA Assessment uses economic information to project the future of rural land uses on a county-by-
county basis. 
Projections from the two Assessments for the period 2015-2050 are summarized in Figure 1.

Urbanization:  USDA-IP reference case projects that urban use grows by about 30 million acres (ma).  
The low development and high development cases indicate +17 and +62 ma respectively. The RPA 
projections range from +27 ma for the B2 scenario to +47 ma (A1B).  Urbanization under the USDA-IP 
reference case and RPA B2 scenario are quite comparable. 
Cropland projections:  USDA-IP scenarios range from a loss of 5 ma (low development) to a loss of 16 
ma (high development).  RPA scenarios range from a loss of 8 million (B2) to a loss of 15 ma (A1B).  
Cropland loss is also comparable between USDA-IP reference and RPA B2 scenarios. 
Forest projections: USDA-IP and RPA projections of forest differ substantially.  USDA-IP reference 
scenario projects an increase of 8 million acres and range from a loss of 4 ma (high development) to a 
gain of 27 ma (low development). RPA projections range from a loss of 11 ma (B2) to a loss of 20 ma 
(A1B). However, the forestland base is very large relative to change so that the range of change is -2.5% 
to +3.5% across all scenarios examined. 
2.1  Midcentury Strategy Scenarios 
Policy scenarios to support the Midcentury Strategy for greenhouse gas emission reductions use the 
USDA-IP as a foundation. These scenarios address different levels of afforestation and forest restoration 
along with changes in wildfire and increased use of solid wood products with associated changes in net 
carbon accumulation in forest and product pools.  All scenarios are built off of the USDA-IP low 
development scenario as a reference case.  Figure 2 summarizes the land use change basis for these policy 
scenarios.

“MCS-low” defines scenarios with a low level of afforestation (+10 million acres) /restoration (+9 million 
acres) effort while MCS-high defines scenarios with a high level of afforestation (+30 million acres) 
/restoration (+14 million acres) effort.  The MCS-highest (target2050) scenario increases the level of 
afforestation to 45 million acres.  Scenarios examine alternative timing of these activities between 2015 
and 2050.
