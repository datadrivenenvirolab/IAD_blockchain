   Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan  
 
EXECUT I VE SUMM AR Y 
The Paris Agreement requires all countries to be part of the global effort to achieve the goal of limiting 
global temperature increase by 1.5-2ºC. This requires global net zero emissions to be reached by the 
middle of the 21st century. 
As a candidate for European Union (EU) membership, the Republic of North Macedonia is obliged to 
transpose the EU legal framework into its national legal system, namely the 2030 Climate and Energy 
Framework and the 2050 Long-term Strategy / European Green Deal. 
This Strategy defines contribution of the country to the global effort, through a pathway towards green, low 
carbon and climate resilient development, based on the best available information and in the context of 
the country’s accession to the EU. 
Addressing climate change requires a set of policies and measures across a wide spectrum of policy 
sectors, each with a precise contribution to the overall achievement of the national climate commitments. 
It is therefore fundamental that the vision and objectives of this strategy are mainstreamed in the agendas 
of line ministries and that they permeate to the relevant sectoral policies, through enhanced horizontal 
policy coordination. This coordination imperative is valid to both emissions reduction (mitigation) and to 
reduced vulnerability to impacts of climate change (adaptation) and is required at national level, but also 
at different levels of administration, namely at local self-government level. 
 
A Long-term Vision  
The Republic of North Macedonia is, by 2050, a prosperous, low carbon economy, following 
sustainable and climate resilient development pathways, enhancing competitiveness and 
promoting social cohesion through action to combat climate change and its impacts. 
 
A long-term objective quantifying North Macedonia’s contribution to the global effort 
Reduction of national net GHG emissions (including Forestry and Other Land Use and 
excluding MEMO items*) of 72% by 2050 compared to 1990 levels (or GHG emission reduction 
of 42% by 2050 compared to 1990, excluding FOLU and MEMO items) and increased resilience 
of North Macedonia’s society, economy and ecosystems to the impacts of climate change. 
 
* MEMO items include emissions from aviation and electricity import 
Specific objectives 
Based on current sectoral greenhouse gas emissions and available measures and technologies, the 
contribution of each sector to the achievement of the overall national target, is defined through the adoption 
of the following sectoral GHG emissions reductions or limitations objectives to be achieved by 2050 
compared to 1990: 
•  Energy sector: -64% (excluding MEMO items) Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan

a significant convergence of financial flows to green

technologies  that  may  lock  the  country  in  a  carbon 
intensive pathway for decades. There’s an established consensus that the later the enabling environment 
for climate investments is set, the more expensive the transition will become. 
Most of the measures are planned to be implemented by consumers, which makes them the largest 
investors, as such, these investments should be largely supported and encouraged by the central and local 
government. 
Private investors (private and state-owned companies) also play an important role in this process of 
transition (mainly for construction of RES capacities), for which it is necessary to create sustainable policies 
and a stable investment climate. 
Contribution to key Sustainable Development Goals 
The  implementation  of  this  strategy  will  align  Republic  of  North  Macedonia  with  the  Sustainable 
Development Goal (SDG) 13 – Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. The 
implementation of the measures included in the WAM scenario for mitigation, will align key indicators for 
Republic  of  North  Macedonia  (such  as  emissions  per  capita  and  per  unit  of  GDP),  with  those  of 
neighbouring EU Member States. Additionally, this strategy is also directly contributing to SGD 7 – Ensure 
access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all, which is supported by the indicator 
Share of renewable energy sources in gross final consumption, which shows an increase from 23% in 
2020 to 49% in 2050 in the WAM scenario. 
Horizontal coordination for a successful implementation of the Strategy 
The implementation of the policies and measures foreseen under this Strategy require comprehensive 
policy planning, coordination and implementation processes. This must be enabled by a comprehensive 
legal basis and legally established coordination instruments to facilitate cross-sectoral policy design and 
implementation, as well as mechanisms to monitor the implementation of the foreseen policies and 
measures. The draft Law on Climate Action provides an enabling environment for overarching policy 
coordination  processes,  and  defines  the  legal  mechanism  for  monitoring  progress  towards  the 
achievement of the national sustainable development pathway. Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan  
 
The capacity need assessment* has also demonstrated that all line ministries need capacities and 
knowledge to be fully capable to integrate climate change aspects into their sectoral plans and programs. 
This means that climate consideration should be brought higher on the political agenda of the Government 
in order for the country to allocate resources to engage additional human capacities at all levels.  
In addition, it is fundamental to mainstream climate change related aspects into future national strategic 
planning documents related to education, R&D, and innovation. The most important national strategic 
documents that should integrate climate related aspects are the future National Strategy for Education and 
the National Innovation Strategy. This will assure the systematic and harmonised integration of climate 
related aspects into the national educational, R&D, and innovation ecosystem, as well as increase 
educational and research capacities, and climate awareness among the general public. 
Way forward 
The adoption of this Strategy should mark a turning point for Republic of North Macedonia, with the country 
embarking on its pathway towards a low carbon, climate resilient sustainable development. This Strategy 
provides for a set of concrete measures aimed at achieving such results, but in particular, provides for a 
vision of the country’s future, which should inspire and shape policy development across the many different 
relevant key sectors. In addition, policy makers need to recognize that despite the recent economic 
recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, investing in climate action is rather a need than a luxury. 
Several other countries have already prepared their economic recovery plans and the international 
community advocates these plans should consider climate action as a building block for sustainable 
economic development. Considering national circumstances, it can be concluded that the implementation 
of the Long-term Strategy on Climate Action would facilitate the recovery of some of the main economic 
sectors including services, tourism, construction and energy, and, at the same time, create new job 
opportunities. In addition, investing in resilience and building adaptation capacities is crucial for dealing 
with the adverse effects of climate change and developing an enabling and sustainable environment for 
investments and economic development. 
The Long-term Strategy on Climate Action supports the sustainable economic recovery of the country and 
the policies and measures foreseen under the Strategy can be used as a steering wheel for investments 
and  financial  injections  for  the  private  and  public  sectors,  which  would  ultimately  bring  economic, 
environmental and social benefits, and enable sustainable development in the country. 
Taking this development pathway grants the people of the Republic of North Macedonia with cleaner air 
and a healthier environment, as well as greater reliance on climate as we now know it. This national effort, 
taken in tandem and in cooperation with our closest allies in the region, in the European Union and at the 
United Nations, should collectively lead us to a limitation of global temperature as established in the Paris 
Agreement. 
   
 
*   Report on institutional analysis and assessment of administrative capacity needs for climate action. 1. INTRODUCTIONLong-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan  
 
1.  I NTR ODU CTIO N  
According to the World Meteorological Organisation, the global average temperature in 2019 was 1.1 
degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial period, while the average temperatures for the five-year (2015-
2019) and ten-year (2010-2019) periods are the highest on record. The current international commitments 
are insufficient to reduce the climate polluting emissions and address the temperature increase, so the 
projected global GHG emissions in 2030 are estimated to be twice what they should be to reach the global 
goal. 
The EU has recognised that the current global efforts are insufficient to meet the GHG reduction targets 
and in November 2019 the Parliament declared a climate emergency asking the Commission to adapt all 
its proposals in line with a 1.5 °C target for limiting global warming and ensure that greenhouse gases 
emissions are significantly reduced. As a response, the European Commission has presented the Green 
Deal which is a roadmap for climate-neutrality of Europe by 2050. The European Green Deal has gained 
huge global attention as a ground-breaking initiative which should demonstrate that climate neutrality and 
the sustainable economic development can go hand by hand and can bring significant progress and 
benefits to the society and to the economy. 
The 2020 global COVID-19 pandemic has brought additional challenges to Europe and to the rest of the 
world. Faced with the reduction of the economic activities and disturbed financial markets, the EU leaders 
are standing in front of another challenge, to set up a Green Deal which will respond to the social and 
economic crisis while transforming Europe into a sustainable and climate neutral economy. For that 
purpose, in April 2020, the European Parliament called to include the European Green Deal in the recovery 
program from the pandemic. Currently, the EU Member States are developing recovery plans as part of 
their existing strategies to address the COVID-19 pandemic, where the transition to a digital and carbon 
neutral economy are at the core.  
As a candidate for European Union (EU) membership, the Republic of North Macedonia is obliged to 
transpose the EU legal framework into its national legal system. Although the country is small in terms of 
population and has a low impact on the global GHG emissions, the Government has recognized the 
importance of climate action and the need for the establishment of comprehensive climate policy aligned 
with the EU acquis to enable future sustainable development in the country. 
In line with the main drivers of national GDP, the national Energy sector is by far the largest contributor to 
national greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This is owed to the fact that the national Energy sector is 
based on fossil fuels, primarily domestic coal – lignite is the main national resource for the production of 
electricity. The electric power generation capacity in Republic of North Macedonia in 2018 mainly consisted 
of two thermal power plants with a total of 824 megawatts (MW) installed capacity; eight large hydropower 
plants with 556.8 MW installed capacity; 96 small hydropower plants with 106.32 MW installed capacity; 
one wind power plant with installed capacity of 36.8 MW; and three Combined Heat and Power (CHP) 
plants with 287 MW installed capacity. 
According to the latest national GHG inventory developed in the framework of the Third Biennial Update 
Report, the GHG emissions of 2016 are reduced by 34.6% compared to the emissions of 1990. The 
decrease  was  induced  by  the  reduced  electricity  production  from  domestic  lignite,  the  fuel  switch 
(increased used of the natural gas), decreased industrial production, as well as the difference between the 
carbon sinks from the forestry sector due to the inconsistency in the statistical representation of the forest 
land and forest disturbances for the year 1990. 
Republic of North Macedonia is a party of the United Nation Framework Convention on Climate Change 
(UNFCCC or Convention) (Official Gazette – 61/97), ratified the Kyoto Protocol (Official Gazette – 49/04) 
and its Doha Amendment (2019) and has associated itself with the Copenhagen Accord (2009). Republic 
of  North  Macedonia  has  signed  (2015)  and  ratified  (2017)  the  Paris  Agreement.  Under  the  Paris 
Agreement, the country became the twenty-third in the world to submit its Intended Nationally Determined 
Contribution for Climate Change (INDC) as per the Decision of the Government No. 42-17/91 of 28 July 
2015. The country has developed three national communications and three biennial update reports, and it 
counts with extensive national expertise for reporting towards the UNFCCC. Furthermore, the country has 
adopted an enhanced Nationally Determined Contribution (eNDC) in April 2021. Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan  
 
The  country  is  also  a contracting  Party  of the  Energy  Community,  which  is  rapidly  advancing  the 
implementation of EU regulations for energy governance and integrated climate and energy planning. In 
July 2020, the Republic of North Macedonia has finalised its National Energy and Climate Plan. 
The Agenda 2030, the Paris Agreement and the forthcoming EU Green Deal on climate change require a 
transformational shift of the economy and society towards climate resilient and sustainable development. 
The current institutional capacities for climate mainstreaming in the country are low, and significant effort 
is required to establish the national system for climate action in the country. This refers not only to the 
national legal framework and institutional capacities, but also to a comprehensive enabling environment 
for climate action, to the allocation of public and private funding, and to public participation and education. 
The Law on Climate Action (Law or LCA) is expected to set a profound change in the climate capacities of 
the country, as well as to enhance cross-sectoral policy coordination and climate mainstreaming in the 
country. However, the draft Law itself is not designed to be a tool for climate action, and additional planning 
documents are needed for cross sectoral and economy wide climate related actions. 
The Project has also prepared an Action Plan for the 1st Stage of Implementation of the Strategy and Law 
(Action Plan). The Action Plan covers the period 2021-2030, contains all the measures envisaged in this 
Long-term Strategy on Climate Action (Strategy), plus measures for administrative and legal strengthening. 
Each measure envisages a period of implementation, indicators, budget, implementation powers and 
stakeholders. 
This Strategy and its Action Plan will support the on-going process to climate action and climate resilience 
of the country. Moreover, the aim of the Strategy is to support the sustainable development of the country, 
to define the benefits and the co—benefits of the climate action, as well as to define the cost of transition 
and the necessary steps to meet the sustainable development pathway of the EU. The long-term objective 
of the Strategy is to serve as a basis for cross sectoral policy planning in the country, as well as to raise 
the climate awareness of all relevant stakeholders, starting from the national and the local authorities, the 
business sector, the academia, as well as the general public. 
However, this Strategy is only the first milestone towards the transitional change required in every home, 
community, workplace, business and farm in the country. Moreover, the whole system for the provision of 
goods and services to the citizens – energy, transport, telecommunication, public service, and waste 
management will have to react quickly and adapt accordingly.  
It is worth to be mentioned that the Strategy follows the requirements for minimum content of the Long 
term strategic planning for climate action as determined in the EU Energy Governance Regulation, 
contained in Annex 4 of the Energy Governance Regulation with enhanced chapters on Cross-sectoral 
aspects, Education, awareness raising, R&D and innovation, Key indicators and Institutional framework 
and modalities for implementation of the Strategy. 
The adaptation measures contained in this Strategy are limited and mainly aimed at addressing the key 
barriers and gaps identified in the Third National Communication. The reason for this is the fact that the 
Strategy and its Action Plan would focus on climate change mitigation measures and policies, while the 
National Adaptation Plan (NAP), which is currently in final phase of application for funding by the Green 
Climate Fund, will focus on comprehensive adaptation policies and measures. In addition to this, sectoral 
adopted strategies in the fields of biodiversity and nature protection address climate adaptation measures, 
while the vulnerability assessments are already addressed in the national communications developed so 
far (water resources, agriculture, forestry, biodiversity, nature protection, tourism, cultural heritage).  
The preparation of River Basin Management Plans is already an established legal obligation, and in 
accordance with the latest decisions at EU level to incorporate climate aspects into such plans, they will 
be implemented in the development of new or updated river basin management plans. 
Taking all of this into account, the scope of the Adaptation chapter within the long term strategy, as decided 
by the PSC, is focused on addressing of key barriers and gaps and providing an enabling environment for 
further climate adaptation.

Republic of North Macedonia ratified the UNFCCC on the 28th of January 1998, and the Paris Agreement 
on the 9th of January 2018. Republic of North Macedonia has committed, under the Paris Agreement, 
throughout its first NDC submitted on 4th August 2015, to ‘reduce the CO  emissions from fossil fuels 
2
combustion for 30%, that is, for 36% at a higher level of ambition, by 2030 compared to the business as 
usual (BAU) scenario.’ Carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions from fossil fuels combustion cover almost 80% of 
2
the total GHG emissions in the country with a dominant share of the following sectors: energy supply, 
buildings and transport. In the enhanced NDC submitted in 2021, the government has increased its 
ambition to ‘reduce greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 by 51% compared to 1990 levels, resulting in an 
82% reduction of net emissions in 2030 compared to 1990 levels’.  
Up to now, climate change related activities in the country were mostly analysed and described under the 
national communications and Biennial Update Reports (BUR), as the reporting obligations of Republic of 
North  Macedonia  to  the  UNFCCC.  However,  the  Paris  Agreement  establishes  a  new  Enhanced 
Transparency Framework (ETF) providing for the reporting and review of information on GHG emissions; 
on progress made to implement and achieve the NDC (mitigation); on impacts and adaptation; and 
technology,  capacity  and  financial support  needed  and  received (or, were  applicable  provided  and 
mobilized). Parties are now actively engaged in establishing the necessary arrangements to implement 
the ETF which will enhance the current measurement, reporting and verification  system under the 
Convention and the Kyoto Protocol. With implementation of the Paris Agreement, Parties will be required 
to  submit  a  Biennial  Transparency  Report  (BTR)  that  contains  a  national  GHG  inventory  and  the 
information necessary to track progress made in implementing and achieving their NDCs. Each Party will 
also have to identify the relevant indicator(s) it will use to track progress made in implementing and 
achieving its NDC. All these new monitoring and reporting requirements, the 1st Global Stocktake in 2023, 
and the requirement for Parties to produce successive NDCs every five years (with each one being a 
‘progression’ on the previous one), stipulates the need for the preparation of a national long-term strategic 
framework with a relevant climate change legal package to meet the long-term objective of the Paris 
Agreement. 
Furthermore, the process of EU integration and approximation of national legislation with the EU climate 
acquis speeded up the development of the relevant climate legal framework which is to some extent 
†
transposing the EU climate legislation  providing, among else, a legal basis for development and updates 
of low-carbon development strategies that includes adaptation to climate change, monitoring, reporting of 
the GHG emissions and implementation of climate policies and measures. 
However, as identified in the process of development of the third Biennial Update Report, there is still a 
lack of adequate mechanisms and instruments in place, especially financial ones (such as carbon 
taxation), as well as capacity constraints for fostering low carbon and climate resilient development. 
 
*   Additional chapter on current situation regarding the GHG emission trends could be added, if needed, as a sub-chapter or

The MoEPP is the body of the state administration responsible for climate change policymaking, a focal 
point for the UNFCCC and a nationally designated entity for the Kyoto Protocol. 
The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs is responsible for the achievement of the 
Sustainable Development Goals, and a National Designated Entity for the Green Climate Fund (GCF). 
Other ministries responsible for climate related issues are: 
-  Ministry of Economy, which is the body of the state administration responsible for the following climate 
related policies: 
o  energy policy including the investments in the energy sector, fossil fuels, energy efficiency and 
renewable energy sources;  
o  internal market policies under which the standards and policies for road transport vehicles and 
the technical conformity are regulated;  
o  mining policies and geological aspects; and 
o  industrial and investments policies. 
-  Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Economy, responsible for the design and implementation 
of agricultural and forestry related policies, as well as for economic use of the water resources. 
-  Ministry of Transport and Communications, responsible for transportation licences for freight and 
passenger transport, aviation activities and railways. In addition, this Ministry is responsible for physical 
planning and the management of construction land. 
-  Ministry of Health, responsible for public health policy. Its relevant areas of responsibility include the 
quality of water used for drinking, chemicals management and medical waste management. Its Institute 
of Public Health has a Department of Environmental Health, which gathers data from the 10 regional 
centres of public health, monitors and evaluates the environmental and climate health risks, identifies 
the priority issues and potential risk to health conditions at the national level and informs the Ministry 
of Health. 
-  Ministry of Finance, which manages the Treasury Single Account, receives all revenues and from which 
all payments are made on behalf of budget users at the central and local government levels. 
-  Energy and Water Services Regulatory Commission, which sets energy and water supply tariffs and 
tariffs for sewerage and wastewater treatment services. 
-  Local Self Governmental Units that organise the municipal utility services (such as waste collection 
and disposal, water supply and sewerage). These Units also determine the charges for waste services. 
The National Climate Change Committee (NCCC) was established as an intergovernmental body to 
provide support and guidance for the overall climate change policies in the country. It was comprised of 
key stakeholder representatives from national institutions, academic institutions, the private sector and civil 
society, and of climate change coordinators appointed by ministries. The draft Law on Climate Change 
envisages the establishment of a National Climate Change Committee as a technical support body, or a 
National Climate Change Council as a political body as a second option, thus providing a legal basis for 
the  work  of  the  National  Climate  Committee  or  National  Climate  Council  and  enhanced  climate 
coordination in the country. 
The National Council for Sustainable Development (NSSD) was established in 2010 as an advisory body 
to the Government with a mission to create and maintain conditions for the implementation of the ‘National 
Strategy for Sustainable Development’ which provides guidance and roadmap for balanced economic, 
social and environmental development of the country in order to integrate into the EU. 
The NCSD is chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister of Republic of North Macedonia in charge of economic 
affairs and coordination of economic sectors and includes representatives from all relevant ministries, Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan  
 
municipal executives, as well as representatives from academia and the private sector. The main task of 
the NSSD is to ensure compliance in the implementation and monitoring of the national Strategy for 
Sustainable Development, as well as the implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development 
Goals in the country, through programs for sustainable development of individual Ministries. 
The implementation of the SDGs in the Republic of Republic of North Macedonia is coordinated and 
monitored through the mechanism with the Technical Working Groups (TWGs) established in the National 
Council for Sustainable Development. 
The main legal basis for climate change policymaking in Republic of North Macedonia currently is the Law 
on Environment (2005), where Article 187 refers to the National Plan for Climate Change Mitigation, and 
Article 188 refers to the National Inventory of GHG Emissions.  
The draft LCA has been finalised and submitted to the Project Beneficiary in September 2020.  
Other policy documents that consider climate change mitigation aspects: 
-  National Energy and Climate Plan (drafted in July 2020 and expected to be adopted by the end of 
2020); 
-  The Strategy for Energy Development of the Republic of Republic of North Macedonia until 2040 
(adopted in December 2019); 
-  Law on Energy; 
-  Energy  Efficiency  Law  compliant  with  Directive  EU/2012/27  on  energy  efficiency  and  Energy 
Performance of Buildings Directive 2010/31/EU, Regulation on Labelling of energy-related products 
2010/30/EU and Directive on Eco-design of energy related products 2009/125/EC; 
-  Bylaws for renewable energy; 
-  National strategy for sustainable development 2009-2030; 
-  Draft National transport strategy 2018-2030; 
-  National strategy for agriculture and rural development for the period 2014-2020; 
-  National strategy on water resource management; 
-  Law on water resource management; 
-  Waste management strategy 2008-2012; 
-  Law on waste management; 
-  Skopje Sustainable Energy Action Plan; and 
-  Resilient Skopje – Climate Change Strategy. 
The country does not have a National adaptation strategy. The development of a National adaptation 
strategy will be initiated next year in the framework of a project implemented by UNDP. 
The most relevant Strategic documents for the Long-term Strategy on Climate Action are the Strategy for 
Energy Development of the Republic of Republic of North Macedonia until 2040 and the Draft National 
Energy  and  Climate  Plan.  The  Energy  Development  Strategy  elaborates  three  different  scenarios: 
reference (business as usual), moderate transition, and green (strong decarbonisation) scenario. The 
moderate transition and green scenario both foresee coal phase-out in 2025 which makes it the first country 
in the Western Balkans to layout concrete options for a pre-2030 coal phase-out. The Energy Strategy 
sees the green scenario as the ‘least cost option’ and this scenario was taken into consideration in the 
draft NECP, which should be considered as an instrument for implementation of the energy and the climate 
related policies in the country.  Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan  
 
2 . 2  Cl i m a te   c ha nge   a da pta ti on  
Republic  of  North  Macedonia  is  characterized  by  a  variable  climate,  which  combined  with  higher 
temperatures and extreme weather events (such as droughts, floods, heat waves and storms); fuelled by 
climate change, make it one of the most vulnerable countries in the world. Such vulnerability to climate 
change is exacerbated by the country’s specificities, namely being landlocked; the diversity of the biomes 
(eight distinct ones), the geography including tall mountains and deep valleys; four main river basins and 
three large natural lakes.  
From a socio-economic perspective, the country also shows high vulnerability, due to the relatively high, 
although decreasing, unemployment rates, in particular among the women and youngest, and a still 
relatively high share of population employed in the agriculture sector, itself extremely vulnerable to climate 
variability and climate change. Nonetheless, despite relatively low compared to neighbouring countries, 
including EU Member States, Republic of North Macedonia’s GDP has been showing an increasing trend 
in the most recent decades, thus contributing to an increase in the capacity to adapt to the impacts of 
climate change. 
Cognisant of such vulnerability, Republic of North Macedonia has been making significant efforts in 
ensuring that the best scientific and technical knowledge is available for an adequate and science-based 
policy decision making. In fact, Republic of North Macedonia has a wealth of information on climate 
impacts, vulnerabilities, and adaptation options, which is, to a great extent, reflected in the country’s official 
national communications to the UNFCCC. 
Very importantly, this scientific knowledge includes detailed analysis of current climate and of climate 
change scenarios. The climate scenario analysis performed in the scope of the preparation of the Fourth 
National Communication to the UNFCCC shows that ‘Macedonia will face a hotter and drier climate in the 
future. The amplitude of this change will primarily be related to the future concentration of GHG. Associated 
with hotter climate in future, increase in hot extremes and decrease in cold extremes is expected. Despite 
drier condition being expected on average on annual level, analysis reveals potential increase in daily 
extreme precipitation that will introduce higher risk of flash floods. On the other hand, expected decrease 
in summer precipitation and extension in duration of consecutive dry days will increase the risk of drought. 
Finally, due to warmer climate, in general, the (agriculture) growing season length is expected to increase. 
Predicted droughts and higher average temperatures pose risks that could lead to a reduction of the 
national water resources, and these should be taken into account when projecting the national hydropower 
potential. 
The climate scenarios analysis covers the period from 2006 to 2100 and all changes are presented with 
respect to the reference period 1986-2005. According to the results, it is expected that temperature 
increase will continue in the future. The expected temperature increases for the middle of the century 
are 1ºC, 2ºC and 2.5ºC for low, mid and high scenario respectively. For the near future (period 2016-
2035), for all three scenarios, the, expected increase of temperature is about 1ºC, compared to 
temperature in the reference period. The temperature increases are expected to be more significant 
in the summer months than in the winter months, and in some regions of the country more than in 
others. 
The analysis of precipitation shows more complex patterns of change in comparison to temperature. 
In the case of the low scenario, there is no clear signal of precipitation change in the future, except 
precipitation increase during the September-October-November season. For the other two scenarios, 
annual  precipitation  decrease  is  expected,  mainly  driven  by  significant  decrease  in  summer 
precipitation. Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan

respectively).* 
Given the climate variability and the information related to future climate change scenarios, Republic of 
North Macedonia has enacted specific sectoral policies which address some of the most important impacts 
of climate change in the country. 
For the biodiversity sector, the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan for the period 2018-2023, 
the National Strategy for Nature Protection (2017-2027) and the Nature Conservation Strategy have been 
adopted. These documents include measures to specifically promote adaptation to climate change. In the 
human health sector, Republic of North Macedonia leads in terms of preparedness to address extreme 
heat and cold, through the implementation of the National Climate Change Health Adaptation Strategy and 
the respective Heat Wave and Cold Weather action plans  
For the remaining relevant sectors, namely water resources; agriculture; forestry, tourism and cultural 
heritage, the country’s adaptive capacity is still low as the policy framework is still incipient. 
Republic of North Macedonia has no binding international commitment to prepare a national strategy and 
action plan for adaptation to the impacts of climate change. However, given the future climate scenarios 
and the country’s assessed vulnerability to climate change, it is in the best national interest to act urgently. 
While there are no such commitments, the UNFCCC has a broad programme designed to support 
countries in the area of adaptation. This programme is composed of seven work streams: Adaptation 
Communication; Adaptation Registry; Loss and Damage; Nairobi Work Programme; National Adaptation 
Plans; National Adaptation Programmes of Action and Technical Examination Process on Adaptation.

MACEDONIA (Project  Fourth National Communication and Third Biennial Update Report on Climate Change under the 
UNFCCC). 
 Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan  
 
Of greater relevance to the scope of this Strategy and Action Plan are the adaptation communication and 
the national adaptation plans. In addition, it must also be considered the adaptation component of the NDC 
and the reporting on adaptation action in the National Communication to the UNFCCC, for which this 
Strategy must make a substantial contribution. 
The adaptation communication and the adaptation component of the NDC are requirements under the 
Paris  Agreement.  As  with  other  adaptation  requirements,  the  communication  and  the  adaptation 
component of the NDC are mostly of a voluntary nature.  
The process for the adaptation component of the NDC should be linked with the process for the National 
Adaptation Plan to be prepared under umbrella of the UNFCCC and with the support of the international 
financing mechanism, in particular the GCF. 
In this context, Republic of North Macedonia is in an advanced stage of harnessing the support from the 
GCF to prepare the National Adaptation Plan, which is to be mandated by this Strategy. This National 
Adaptation Plan is to identify medium- and long-term adaptation needs and develop and implement 
programmes to address those needs. It is a continuous, progressive and iterative process which follows a 
country-driven, gender-sensitive, participatory and fully transparent approach. 
Despite  the  wealth  of  information  and  of  the  good  practices  in  adaptation  policy  planning  and 
implementation described above, Republic of North Macedonia still faces a set of important gaps and 
barriers which limit the country’s capacity to effectively adapt to climate change. Such gaps and barriers 
have been studied in detail and are to be addressed by this Strategy. Two such major gaps and barriers 
can be identified: the institutional framework, including inter-sectorial coordination mechanism, which 
require strengthening; and the lack of solid systems for the regular and periodic collection data required 
for solid science-based decision making on adaptation. 
In this context, the measures included in this Strategy and Action Plan will focus on addressing the gaps 
and barriers identified in the area of data availability, consistency and transparency, as well as in the areas 
of institutional capacity and climate scenario development and analysis. 
The sectoral measures for adaptation to climate change will be developed in the scope of the National 
Adaptation Plan.

The COVID-19 pandemic induced vast and global economic and social problems. It is estimated that the 
economic impact of the pandemic will be more significant than that of the financial crisis of 2007-2008. 
Economic activity has been shut down in support of social distancing, leading to job losses at a pace that 
greatly exceeds the worst months of the Great Recession, reducing demand in the world economy, and 
disrupting supply chains. 
According to the World Bank’s latest Regular Economic Report (RER), the pandemic caused a huge hit to 
the Macedonian economy and the country is coping with its deepest recession in two decades. Despite 
the measures that the Government has introduced to reduce the economic impact of the pandemic, the 
unemployment rate increased to 16.7 per cent, 17,690 people lost their jobs in the second quarter of the 
year, while the national economic activity is forecast to decline by 4.1 per cent in 2020. 
According to the predictions of national financial institutions, a stronger recovery and growth of economic 
activity in Republic of North Macedonia is expected in the mid-term, as life and economic activity return to 
normal, although the speed of economic recovery depends on the duration and intensity of the pandemic. 
Restoration of confidence of both consumers and investors is expected, as well as growth of private 
consumption and investment.  
The implementation of policies and measures related to climate action will speed up the recovery of 
investments and activities in main economic sectors such as services, tourism, construction, and energy, 
and, at the same time, create new and green job opportunities. The COVID-19 recovery and the Strategy 
can play complementary roles in building a green, resilient, and inclusive future. Policymakers need to Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan  
 
recognize that climate action can drive the sustainable economic recovery of the country, by means of the 
implementation  of  policies  and  measures  foreseen  under  the  Strategy  and  other  climate  action 
mechanisms. 
The implementation of the above-mentioned measures would also generate green jobs* and create training 
opportunities in fields including renewable energy, energy efficiency, energy access, improving household 
resilience, provision of infrastructure needed to support active transport and infrastructure for EVs, 
sustainable and resilient forestry and agriculture, etc. 
In addition, it is essential to take proactive steps to build climate resilience and invest in adaptation 
measures, especially for society’s poorest or most marginalized, as well as for the sectors most affected 
by the pandemic. Finally, investing in resilience and building adaptation capacities is crucial to deal with 
the adverse effects of climate change and to provide an enabling and sustainable environment for 
economic investments and development. 
   
 
*   According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) and other sources, investing $1 million in renewable energy or building 
efficiency creates more than twice as many jobs as investing $1 million in fossil fuels. 3. OVERALL VISION AND CLIMATE

3.  OVER ALL   VISI ON   AND  CL IM AT E OB JECT I VES OF 
T HE C OUN TRY 
3 . 1  O v e r al l   vi s i on 
Considering the current situation regarding climate change in Republic of North Macedonia, the results of 
the modelling of the GHG emissions, including the respective social, economic and environmental impacts 
as described in the following chapters, and taking into consideration the Paris Agreement, and the 
European Union’s 2030 Climate and Energy Framework, the European strategic long-term vision for a 
prosperous, modern, competitive and climate neutral economy, the vision of this Strategy is as follows:  
Republic of North Macedonia is, by 2050, a prosperous, low carbon 
economy, following sustainable and climate resilient development pathways, 
enhancing competitiveness and promoting social cohesion through action 
to combat climate change and its impacts. 
This vision of the Strategy is based on the recognition that, in the framework of the Paris Agreement, all 
countries will deliver their fair and ambitious contribution towards the global temperature goals inscribed 
in that agreement, which requires peaking of the global greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible 
and achieving a balance between global emissions and global sinks in the second half of the century. The 
vision enshrines Republic of North Macedonia’s sustainable development approach to fighting the causes 
and the impacts of climate change, in which a fairer and more equal society will be built , considering 
gender equality and female empowerment*; the economy will successfully compete with other economies 
under the same conditions; and the environment will be protected for the benefit of future, but also of the 
current generations. 
3 . 2  G e ne r al   a nd spe c i fi c   obje c ti v e s 
On the basis of modelling results, the results of the Strategic Environmental Impact Assessment, the 
foreseen socio-economic benefits and the need to adapt to changed climatic conditions, the general 
objective is: 
Reduction of national net GHG emissions (including Forestry and Other Land Use and excluding 
MEMO items) of 72% by 2050 compared to 1990 levels (or GHG emission reduction of 42% by 
2050 compared to 1990, excluding FOLU and MEMO items) and increased resilience of Republic 
of North Macedonia’s society, economy and ecosystems to the impacts of climate change 
 
It should be noted that MEMO items include emissions from aviation and electricity import.  
In  order to support compliance  with  the  general  objective  and  with the  implementation  of  sectoral 
measures, the general objective is disaggregated into specific mitigation, adaptation and crosscutting 
objectives, where specific mitigation objectives reflect the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC) sectoral aggregation of GHG emissions and, therefore, to the extent possible, also correspond to 
the division of responsibilities for the achievement of specific objectives.  
Specific mitigation objectives: 
•  Specific objective 1: To reduce GHG emissions by 64% in the Energy sector (excluding MEMO 
items) by 2050 compared to 1990.  
 
* Preamble, Paris Agreement Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan  
 
The energy industries sector will deliver the greatest emissions reductions, namely through the 
implementation  of  the  polluter  pays  principle  (carbon  taxation)  and  through  the  increased 
penetration of renewable energy sources (RES) in the energy mix. This will require an important 
transformation of the sector, given the current important reliance on the carbon intensive national 
lignite as a source of energy. The internalization of the cost of CO  in the price paid by the final 
2
consumer will provide an incentive for market participants to move to zero or lower emitting fuels 
(RES, natural gas); to adopting processes (in the industrial sector) which are less energy intensive 
and producing higher added value products; and/or promoting energy efficiency in order to reduce 
demand for electricity. The technological advancement of the RES technologies, especially the 
ones related to wind and solar generation, has substantially reduced the relevant installation and 
operation costs, making wind and solar capacity able to offer very competitive prices in the 
wholesale electricity markets. Market prices, nevertheless, assuming the internalization of the 
carbon prices in the bids of thermal power plants, are at adequate level and allow the cost recovery 
for wind and solar investments, reducing the need for subsidies and financial support. 
Furthermore, on the side of consumption of energy, energy efficiency is at the core of the climate 
and energy policies and is fundamental to a competitive economy and a secure and resilient energy 
system. Attributing priority to energy efficiency is the only way to avoid wasting the costly energy 
produced and delivered to the final consumer. Investments in energy efficiency provide important 
cost-savings to businesses and households (in addition to enhanced thermal comfort, in particular 
in the residential sector), thus constituting an important incentive to participate in the efforts towards 
a carbon constrained economy. In addition to reductions achieved in households and tertiary 
sector, reduction of GHG emissions in the transport sector is to be achieved mostly through an 
increase of energy efficiency and through the renewal of the fleet. In this context, the introduction 
of hybrid and electric vehicles will play an important role, but, in the short term, not as important as 
the reduction of fuel consumption in traditional combustion vehicles, which will, by 2030, remain as 
the typical vehicle in Republic of North Macedonia. 
•  Specific objective 2: To reduce GHG emissions by 34% in the Agriculture sector by 2050 compared 
to 1990. 
Agriculture will contribute to GHG emissions reductions through the adoption of measures that 
contribute to sustainable agriculture, through increased carbon sequestration in the soil (as a result 
of increased organic matter in the soil), and increased efficiency in milk production and reduced 
fertilizer input through enhanced agriculture practices and implementation of new technologies. 
•  Specific objective 3: To increase carbon sinks by 1733% in the Forest and Other Land Use sector 
by 2050 compared to 1990. 
The Republic of North Macedonian forest has as important role to play in the transition to a low 
carbon economy, as it can provide a carbon neutral energy source and a great potential to increase 
the net carbon sink of the country. Afforestation and sustainable forest management will transform 
the forest sector in the country, providing great opportunities for job creation and to enhance 
resilience to climate change impacts. It should be noted that the afforestation and reforestation 
activities should be done in a professional manner, carefully selecting the tree species and 
diversity, taking into consideration preservation of old trees and grasslands, which are important 
for the ecosystems and the biodiversity. 
•  Specific objective 4: To reduce GHG emissions by 2% in the Waste sector by 2050 compared to 
1990. 
Reduction of GHG emissions in the waste sector will take place through the implementation of the 
measures contained in the current waste policy framework which is already to some extend aligned 
with  the  EU  acquis.  Nonetheless,  based  on  the  assessment  of  the  current  situation*,  the 
 
*   North Macedonia 2019 Report, European Commission staff working document, Brussels, 29.5.2019 SWD(2019) 218 final.
 Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan  
 
implementation of the current existing measures is lagging behind and requires an important effort 
up to 2030 and beyond. 
Specific adaptation objectives 
•  Specific objective 5: To build solid systems for the regular and periodic collection data for the 
production and dissemination of scientific and technical knowledge. 
Data collection system proves to be crucial for the appropriate and timely response to the effects 
of climate change. This is in particularly important in the field of water resource and the use of water 
for irrigation. Furthermore, adapting to climate change in agriculture requires the vertical integration 
of scientific knowledge creation and dissemination. In addition, climate change may have significant 
impacts on biodiversity which requires development of a national research plan for biodiversity and 
an indicator system to monitor the impacts of climate change on biodiversity. Above all, accurate 
real-time air-climate-health data is important for the whole society and significant improvement of 
the processes for collection and dissemination of such data is crucial for the adaptive capacity of 
the sector human health. 
•  Specific objective 6: To increase the resilience of climate change impacts of key socio-economic 
sectors and ecosystems. 
The preparation and adoption of the National Adaptation Plan is an important step for Republic of 
North Macedonia to identify adaptation needs and to develop and implement policies and measures 
and actions to address those needs; and enable actions to protect vulnerable communities. 
Specific horizontal/crosscutting objective 
•  Specific  objective  7:  To  establish  comprehensive  policy  planning,  coordination  and  policy 
implementation instruments for climate action. 
This has to be enabled by a comprehensive legal basis and legally established coordination instruments 
for facilitation of the cross sectoral policy design and implementation, as well as mechanisms for monitoring 
of the implementation of the foreseen policies and measures.  
•  Specific objective 8: Mainstream climate change related aspects into the future national strategic 
planning documents related to education, research, and development, innovation, social inclusion 
and equal opportunities on women and men,  
The most important national strategic documents that should integrate climate related aspects are the 
future National Strategy for Education and the National Innovation Strategy. This will assure systematic 
and harmonised integration of the climate related aspects in the national educational, R&D and innovation 
ecosystem, as well as will increase the educational and the research capacities and the climate awareness 
of the general public. At the same time, intersecting climate change and gender will ensure effectiveness 
of the climate resilience policies and measures. 
•  Specific objective 9: To promote the green transition through capacity building, training for new 
skills and awareness rising. 
The transition to a low carbon economy is based on technological innovation, on large scale 
investment and policy decisions, but is also based on decision and behaviours of the individual 
citizen. Well informed and aware citizens, of all ages, are more likely to actively engage in the effort 
to reduce GHG emissions. Additionally, reducing GHG emissions require new technical skills which 
can be acquired via education via the school system, but also, via adult training, thus facilitating 
the transfer of workers from sectors with job losses to sectors with job gains. Overall climate change 
framework needs to be managed and supervised by competent authorities where significantly 
enhanced capacity is needed as a pre-condition for sustainable implementation, monitoring and 
reporting of mitigation policies and measures.

In this Strategy, two scenarios for climate change mitigation were developed. One is a scenario that 
assumes transition using existing policies and measures (WEM), and the other considers a more radical 
transition using additional policies and measures (WAM). Having in mind that in 2019-2020 few documents 
in the field of Energy and Climate Change were prepared and adopted, these two scenarios are in 
accordance with the scenarios developed as part of the Strategy for Energy Development up to 2040 
(adopted by the Government in 2019), 3rd Biennial Update Report on Climate Change (TBUR) - Mitigation 
report - 2020 and the final draft version of the National Energy and Climate Plan – 2020 (Table 1). In 
addition, the measures proposed in these documents are also applied in this Long-term Strategy on 
Climate Action (Strategy). 
The scenarios developed in this Strategy, unlike the scenarios in all the previously mentioned documents, 
additionally consider the period 2040-2050. The main objective, key assumptions and a brief description 
of the mitigation policies and measures considered in each of the scenarios is presented in Table 2. It 
should be underlined that in the IPPU sector there are no measures considered, while in the AFOLU and

The summary of the obtained results for 2050 shows that the total net GHG emissions are projected to be 
reduced by 23% in the WEM scenario and 72% in the WAM scenario, compared to the 1990 level (Table 
3). Having in mind that most of the emissions are coming from the Energy sector, the reduction of 72% in 
the total net GHG emissions can be achieved if the emissions in the Energy sector are reduced by 64% in 
2050, compared to 1990 level. At the same time, GHG removals play an important role, especially towards 
the EU vision of carbon neutrality, and in Republic of North Macedonia it is projected that the removals will 
increase 18 times compared to the 1990 level. Although this increase looks drastic, it should be noted that 
according to the Greenhouse Gas Inventory (TBUR) compared to 2016, these removals represent an 
increase of only 17% in 2050. Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan  
 
As previously explained, in the IPPU sector, no measures are proposed, and only simple regression model 
is used, which leads to an increase of the GHG emissions by 153% in 2050 compared to 1990. Therefore, 
if this sector is excluded from the total net GHG emissions, the total reductions reach 90% in 2050 
compared to the 1990 level in the WAM scenario.  
For the realization of the WEM scenario 19 Bill. EUR are needed, while for the WAM scenario additional 
16 Bill. EUR are needed, as investments. However, the total system costs in the WAM scenario are lower 
compared to the WEM scenario; for example, in the Energy sector the total system costs are lower for 16 
Bill. EUR in the period 2020-2050.

4 . 1  Ke y   dr i ve r s 
Given that there are certain input parameters used in most of the sectors (Energy, IPPU and Waste), and 
have a significant impact on the projections, especially for energy needs (useful energy), these parameters 
are referred to as key drivers.  
One of the key drivers for projections of the GHG emissions is the GDP growth. Using the same drivers as 
in the National Energy Development Strategy, the projection over the period 2018 - 2050 is that the real 
GDP will grow with an average rate of 3.3% (Figure 3). Such a GDP growth rate could position a developing 
country as Republic of North Macedonia in 2050 closer to the levels of GDP per capita that are common 
for developed Central and Eastern European countries today. Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan

Population growth is the other key driver, which is the same as in the National Energy Development 
Strategy, i.e. it is based on the UN population estimates and projections. The population is expected to 
decline by 0.3% in 2050 compared to 2017 (Figure 4).

4. 2. 1  Key  assum pti ons 
In addition to key drivers, the Energy sector uses a number of other inputs, on which energy demand 
projections depend. The main input data and assumptions for the Households, Commercial and Services, 
Industry and Transport sector are given below in this section. 
Households, Commercial and Services sector 
For calculating the useful energy demand projections in the households, besides the key drivers, a number 
of other parameters are used. Number of persons in a household is one of them, which is projected to 
decline from 3.7 in 2017 to around 3 in 2050 (Figure 5). This decreasing of the number of persons per 
households is based on the average number at EU level (which is 2.4 in 2019), and the fact that none of 
the Member State has more than three persons per households in 2019. According to this number and the 
projected population, the number of households is estimated to around 635,000 in 2050. Based on the 
Household Survey conducted by the State Statistical Office in 2014, the distribution per type of households Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan  
 
is 42% apartments, 31% urban single houses and 27% rural single houses. In order to reduce the number 
of assumptions and uncertainties the same distribution is applied during the whole period.

For projecting the useful demand for heating and cooling, the size of the households is important which is 
projected to reach 100 m2 for single houses and 80 m2 for apartments in 2050 (Figure 5). The assumption 
for household size growth follows S curve, which has growth until 2035 when it reaches the average level 
of EU countries (in 2012). The size of the urban single houses is growing the most, because at the moment 
it stands out the most from the EU average. This assumption is additionally supported by the State 
Statistical Office data (Construction sector), where it is shown that in the period 2012-2018 the area of 
constructed dwellings has increased by 22%. 
Additionally, the share of heated area is also projected to increase to around 90% for apartments, 53% for 
urban houses and 45% for rural houses in 2050. Based on the Survey conducted by the State Statistical 
Office on energy consumption in Households, it is obtained that the average specific consumption is 
around 160 kWh/m2 in 2014 in the Households.

Figure 6. Size of households and share of heated area 
For the commercial building stock, data according to third National Energy Efficiency Action Plan are used 
where the commercial building area is estimated to nearly 8 million m2. For the public building stock, heated 
area of the building block from the National Program for EE in public buildings (Draft version) is considered 
(where the average specific consumption is 214 kWh/m2).  
Furthermore, for both the households and the commercial sector, the average heating and cooling degree 
days are calculated for the period 2000-2017, and this average is used for the period 2018 - 2050 (2005 
heating and 1053 cooling degree days). 
Industry sector Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan  
 
For the industry sector, based on the historical data, correlation between the GDP and the total industry 
growth rate is made, and these correlations together with the projections for GDP are used for projecting 
the value added of the Industry up to 2050. The projections of the energy demand in the Industry sector 
are based on the added value per industry type (Figure 7).  
It is assumed that the overall Industry is correlated with the GDP growth and the share of each Industry in 
the total value added is similar as in 2018 (since there are no major differences in the shares in the historical 
data for the period 2011-2017, according to the State Statistical Office data).

Transport sector 
For the transport sector, the main drivers according to which the energy demand is projected are the 
passenger and freight kilometres. These parameters are calculated according to the GDP growth, number 
of vehicles, number of km per vehicle and number of passengers per vehicle (Figure 8). Additionally, the 
projections for the number of light duty vehicles are calculated using the relation between number of 
cars/capita and GDP/capita (i.e. ownership growth elasticity relative to income growth is calculated).  
It is projected that up to 2050 the freight kilometres will be almost tripled, and the passenger kilometres 
will be almost doubled, following an S curve. Most of the passenger kilometres (around 79% in 2050) are 
from the light duty vehicles. It should be noted that the number of passenger kilometres presented on 
Figure 8. assumes no measures, so the number and distribution of the passenger kilometres in the WEM 
and WAM scenarios (after the measures are applied) is different.

Fuel prices Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan  
 
The global trends of the fossil fuels prices are also very important for planning the energy system, and they 
show that the natural gas price will almost double in 2050 compared to 2018 in the WEM scenario, while 
in the WAM scenario it will be increased for around 40% in the same period (Figure 9). Additionally, the 
price of oil in the WEM scenario will be drastically increased by about 3.5 times, and in the WAM scenario 
it is increased for 30% in 2050 compared to 2018. The price of the imported coal is also increasing in the 
WEM scenario for 58%, and in the WAM scenario it remains at almost the same level as the price in 2017 
for the whole planning period.  
On the other hand, the CO  tax is projected to be introduced in 2027 in the WEM scenario with a moderate 
2
increase of 2.3 times in 2050 compared to 2027. In the WAM scenario the CO  tax is projected to be 
2
introduced much earlier (in 2023), with a higher increase rate of almost 6 times in 2050 compared to 2023. 
The import price of electricity is based on HUDEX and in deep modelling on electricity price in Europe 
made as part of the Energy Strategy. In the first five years 2020-2025 the import price is around 45 
EUR/MWh, after which it starts to increase, achieving maximum of 90 EUR/MWh.

4. 2. 2  Pow er   gener ation 
In the case of the WEM scenario, the analysis shows that the electricity generation will increase by 76% 
in 2050 (Figure 10). Regarding the electricity generation, the key findings for this scenario are: 
•  The coal power plants will continue to operate over the period of analysis, with a slight reduction in 
their production from 2.8 TWh in 2017 to 2.5 TWh in 2050. This is mainly a result of the 
decommissioning of TPP Oslomej as well as lower production of TPP Bitola. In terms of total 
electricity generation, the share of coal power plants will drop from 39% in 2017 to 20% in 2050.  
•  The reduced production of coal power plants will be replaced with the electricity generation from 
power plants using natural gas, as well as RES. The production of the natural gas power plants will 
increase from 0.8 TWh in 2017 to 1.8 TWh in 2050, due to the increase in the generation capacity 
as a more cost-effective long-term option compared to new lignite power plants on imported coal, Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan  
 
considering the CO  tax as well. However, their share in the total electricity generation will slightly 
2
increase from 11% in 2017 to 14% in 2050.  
•  The RES utilization will be intensified, mainly by increasing the production of the hydropower plant 
from 1.1 TWh in 2017 to 4.2 TWh in 2050 (normalized). A noticeable increase is also evident in the 
electricity generation from PV power plants (from 0.03 TWh in 2017 to 1.7 TWh in 2050) and wind 
power plants (from 0.12 TWh in 2017 to 1.2 TWh in 2050). Their share in the total electricity 
generation will increase from 15%, 0.4%, and 2% in 2017 to 34%, 13%, and 10% in 2050 for hydro, 
PV, and wind power plants, respectively. 
•  The intensified production from domestic resources will reduce the net import of electricity for 1.2 
TWh in 2050 compared to 2017 (from 2.2 TWh in 2017 to 1 TWh in 2050). The electricity production 
will be mainly based on RES.  
In the WAM scenario, the electricity generation will increase by 48% in 2050, or compared to the WEM 
scenario the 16% less electricity will be produced in 2050 (Figure 10). The key findings from the WAM 
scenario in terms of the electricity generation are: 
•  The coal power plants will stop their production after 2025. Their decommissioning is driven by the 
higher carbon tax introduced in the WAM scenario.  
•  By 2025, the electricity generation from power plants on natural gas will be more than doubled, 
compared to 2017. After 2030, with the increase of CO  price and the introduction of more RES the 
2
production of the gas power plants will not be cost-effective, thus reducing the level of production 
for 50% compared to 2017. This will also decrease their share in the total electricity generation 
from 11% in 2017 to 4% in 2050.  
•  Regarding the RES utilization, the production of the hydropower plant will increase at the same 
level as in the WEM scenario, and the introduction of the PV and wind power plants in the system 
will be more intensified. Their share in the total electricity generation will increase from 15%, 0.4%, 
and 2% in 2017 to 40%, 28%, and 18% in 2050 for hydro, PV, and wind power plants, respectively. 
The system flexibility in this case has to be ensured in order to balance the electricity produced by 
PV and wind power plants, mainly by the construction of (pump storage) hydro-power plants, 
biomass and biogas power plants, and implementation of demand response and electrification of 
the transport sector. 
•  In general, a decreasing trend of net import can be observed, i.e. from 2.2 TWh in 2017 to 0.8 TWh 
in 2050. After 2030, the net import of electricity is slightly higher compared to the WEM scenario, 
to satisfy the remaining part of the electricity consumption that could not be covered by the installed 
power generation capacities in the WAM scenario. 
Mainly as a result of the intensified introduction of renewable energy sources and the decommission of the 
coal power plants in the WAM, compared to the WEM scenario, the GHG emissions are drastically reduced 
by almost 93% in 2050 compared to 2017 in the WAM scenario, while this reduction in the WEM scenario 
is only around 10%. 
Based on the electricity generation from different energy sources and the final electricity consumption, the 
electricity grid factor is calculated up to 2050 and presented on Figure 10. It can be noticed that the 
electricity grid factor reduces to zero after 2025 in the WAM scenario. Additionally, in the mitigation analysis 
very often the CO  production factor of electricity generated from lignite and natural gas is needed, so 
2
these values are also calculated and presented for the period up to 2050 (Figure 10).

Note: the production from the Hydro Power Plants is normalized starting from 2018 (according to the RES Directive). It should be mentioned that 
2017 is a hydrologically unfavorable year, with electricity production from hydropower plants much lower than average. For comparison, according 
to the SSO Energy Balance, in 2015, the production from hydropower plants is 1.9 TWh; in 2016, 1.9 TWh; and in 2018, 1.8 TWh. 
Figure 10. Electricity generation by type of technology 
Currently, the installed capacity of power plants in the country is 1.8 GW, out of which around 42% takes 
the lignite power plants, 38% hydropower plants, 16% are natural gas power plants, around 3% wind power 
plant, 1% is for PV, and biogas power plants have less than 1%. The growing electricity demand requires 
additional generating capacities. Therefore, in the WEM scenario, an additional capacity of 2.6 GW will be 
installed in the power system by 2050, while in the WAM scenario additional 3.2 GW is needed or 15% 
more compared to the WEM scenario in 2050 (Figure 10). 
In the WEM scenario, lignite power plant Oslomej will be shut down by 2025, but TPP Bitola will remain in 
the system during the planning period. By 2050, an additional capacity of 0.2 GW of power plants on 
natural gas will be added to the system (conversion of HFO TPP Negotino to natural gas). Regarding the 
RES potential, the installed capacity of hydropower plants will increase for around 1 GW in 2050, which is 
more than double compared to 2017.  
Construction of new hydro power plants is not foreseen in the period 2040 – 2050.  
The installed capacity of large hydropower plants in the analyzed 2017 is estimated at 556.8 MW, while 
the WAM scenario envisages the installed capacity of the large hydropower plants to increase by an 
additional 808 MW by 2040/2050. 
It is important to note that construction of new hydro power plants is not foreseen in the period 2040 – 
2050. By 2040, it is planned to have a total of 160 MW small hydropower plants with feed-in tariff (same 
as planned in the adopted Energy Strategy of 2019). According to the data from the Energy Regulatory 
Commission, as of December 2020, of these 160 MW, a total of 115 MW have already been built (have 
the status of preferential producer) or are under construction (have the temporary status of preferential 
producer).  This  means  that  in  the  period  until  2040/2050  additional  35  MW  should  be  built,  plus 
approximately 10 MW on the already existing Zletovica hydro system. 
The construction of new hydropower plants should avoid the disproportionate environmental impact 
compared to electricity generated. The selection of locations for construction of hydropower plants should 
be carefully assessed to avoid adverse environmental impacts and should take into considerations the 
legal framework for environmental protection, biodiversity protection, nature conservation, as well as Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan  
 
Governmental decisions. In addition, it is recommended the capacity of the water supply systems to be 
used for small hydropower plants if justified according to economic and technical assessments. 
The highest increase is estimated for the installed capacity of the PV power plants, or around 1.2 GW of 
additional capacity will be included in the power system by 2050. A significant increase of 0.5 GW by 2050 
is also noticeable for wind power plants. Hence, in 2050 the share of the RES in the total installed capacity 
will be 81%, or 40% for hydropower plants, 27% for PV, 13% for wind, and almost 1% for biogas power 
plants. 
In the case of the WAM scenario, the operation of lignite power plants will no longer be a cost-effective 
option after 2025. The main reason is the higher carbon price in the WAM scenario which makes TPP 
Bitola and TPP Oslomej an economically not viable option. Because of the decommissioning of the coal 
power plants, around 0.14 GW additional capacity of power plants on natural gas is estimated to enter the 
power system by 2030 (conversion of HFO TPP to natural gas), besides the RES capacity. The analysis 
shows that the natural gas units will be used mainly for balancing of the grid having in mind the RES 
installed capacity (especially after 2030). Same as in the WEM scenario, the highest increase is estimated 
for the installed capacity of RES. By 2050 the installed capacity of hydropower will increase for around 1 
GW, the capacity of PV power plants for 2.1 GW, and the capacity of wind power plants for 0.9 GW. In 
terms of their share in the total installed capacity, hydropower plants will participate with 35%, PV power 
plants with 41% and the wind power plants with 19%.

Figure 11. Installed capacity by type of technology 
The price of electricity in both WEM and WAM scenarios increases as a result of the increase of the CO  
2
tax and investments in new capacities, primarily on renewable energy sources (Figure 12). While the price 
for each type of consumers is almost doubled in this period, it should be noted that at the same time the 
GDP/capita is increased for almost three times. Additionally, the realization of the WAM scenario, where 
there is a drastically greater penetration of renewable energy sources, does not lead to a significant 
increase in the price for consumers. The biggest difference appears in the period 2025-2030 when the 
decommission of TPP Bitola in the WAM scenario is foreseen, and to ensure the security of the system 
there is construction of a new gas power plant that operates at a higher price compared to the price in the 
WEM scenario. Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan

4. 2. 3  I ndust r y  
The total final energy consumption in the Industry in the WEM scenario increases by 0.8 Mtoe in 2050 
compared to 2017 (Figure 13). Although this increase appears to be drastic, it should be noted that due to 
the World Crisis, European Crises and introduction of environmental standards in the Industry sector, there 
was closing and reopening of some of the major industry capacities in Republic of North Macedonia in the 
recent period (2012-2017). However, it is assumed that all these capacities will restart and in 2025 the final 
energy consumption will be at the 2012 level, and in 2030 it will be at 2007 level. Because the mix of fuels 
used in Industry in the WEM scenario is similar throughout the planning period, emissions increase 
accordingly at a similar rate, reaching 2.8 Tg CO2-eq in 2050.  
On the other hand, the higher price of the CO  tax in the WAM scenario contributes to the change of the 
2
fuel mix, primarily for the decommissioning of coal, which at the same time contributes to the introduction 
of more advanced technologies (using mainly natural gas, biomass and electricity) which together with the 
industrial energy management measures and the introduction of more efficient electric motors contribute 
to a 25% reduction in energy consumption in the WAM scenario compared to the WEM scenario in 2050. 
At the same time, the change in the fuel mix leads to a drastic reduction in GHG emissions of about 60% 
in the WAM scenario compared to the WEM scenario in 2050. 
However, despite the introduction of these measures in the WAM scenario, it is obvious that after 2030 
GHG emissions start to increase slightly, mainly due to the Industrial growth on the one hand and on the 
other hand because the proposed improved technologies reach their maximum technical efficiency. To 
prevent the growth of emissions after 2030 or 2040, it is necessary to introduce new technologies that will 
use low-carbon fuels, such as hydrogen, or electricity (which in that period will be primarily produced from 
renewable energy sources). Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan

Figure 13. Final energy consumption by fuels in the industry sector 
4. 2. 4  T r anspor t 
After industry, transport is projected to be the second fastest growing sector in terms of final energy 
consumption. In the WEM scenario, the consumption increases by about 60% in 2050 compared to 2017. 
The gradual introduction of biofuels in the period from 2020 to 2030 (when they reach a maximum of 10%) 
is the main reason for reducing GHG emissions in this period, although there is an increase in energy 
consumption. In the period after 2030, GHG emissions increase, but at a slower rate than the increase in 
final energy consumption, as a result of: biofuels and the introduction of vehicles that use fuels with lower 
emission factors, such as CNG and electricity. 
In the WAM scenario, the growth of final energy consumption is almost twice lower compared to the WEM 
scenario. Unlike the WEM scenario, WAM in the period until 2030 has a reduction in greenhouse gas 
emissions and energy consumption primarily due to the penetration of hybrid vehicles and electric vehicles. 
In the period from 2030-2040, the trend of vehicle electrification continues, but as a result of freight 
transport there is a slight increase in emissions. Additionally, at the beginning of this period, another minor 
trend of import of used diesel and gasoline vehicles is expected to occur, having in mind that the efficiency 
of the imported used vehicles is close to the efficiency of the new vehicle sold on the market in that specific 
period. This growth of emissions will stop after 2040, primarily due to the introduction of hydrogen, greater 
penetration of CNG, as well as greater penetration of hybrid vehicles in light and heavy freight transport. 
At the same time, the trend of electrification and purchase of hybrid vehicles continues with light duty 
vehicles. All this leads to a gradual reduction of the share of diesel fuel in transport, which allows a 
downward trend in emissions. Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan

Figure 14. Final energy consumption by fuels in the transport sector 
4. 2. 5  Househol ds,   com m er ci al  and ser vi ces 
In the WEM scenario, household energy consumption is projected to increase by 13% in 2050 compared 
to 2017, but emissions are reduced by about 21%, primarily due to reduced use of oil and LPG, improved 
energy efficiency and higher share of natural gas and renewables in the household (Figure 15). On the 
other hand, in the WAM scenario the introduction of more efficient technologies, class A, A+, A++ and 
A+++ (primarily for heating and hot water, but also other devices), more efficient lighting, the improvement 
of building performance (through their insulation and windows replacement) leads to a reduction in the 
consumption of final energy of 8% in 2050 compared to 2017. Correspondingly, there is a reduction of 
GHG emissions by about 52% in the same period. However, direct GHG emissions from the household 
sector are very small considering that biomass and electricity have the largest share in the final energy 
consumption. 
Compared to the, for example, Industrial sector where there is high impact from the international prices 
(oil, gas, coal), in the households sector the biomass and electricity which are mainly domestic are 
expected to remain the main energy sources during the whole planning period in both scenarios. Therefore, 
the share of fuels in households generally remains similar in both scenarios, so that in 2050 compared to 
2017 there is an increase in the share of electricity, a decrease in the share of biomass, and in the WAM 
scenario there is a larger share of renewables compared to WEM scenario. The decrease of the biomass 
consumption is driven by the replacement of inefficient biomass stoves with high efficient biomass stoves 
(for example, pellet stoves), as well as their replacement with heat pumps, due to the air pollution problem 
in the cities and the current strong policy of the Government for subsidizing heat pumps and more efficient 
biomass stoves. At the same time, there is also increase of the heat (district heating) as a result of the 
Government policy for decreasing the value added tax from 18% to 5%. The introduction of heat pumps 
with higher COP in the WAM scenario, the increased solar thermal collectors for hot water, as well as 
increased District heating will reduce the gas consumption compared to WEM scenario.  Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan

Figure 15. Final energy consumption by fuels in the household sector 
As a result of the macroeconomic drivers, in the commercial and services sector in the WEM scenario 
there  is  an  increase  in  final  energy  consumption  by  38%  in  2050  compared  to  2017  (Figure  15). 
Nevertheless, greenhouse gas emissions in the same period decreased by about 20% due to greater 
penetration of natural gas technologies, renewable sources, greater use of district heating, but also the 
electrification of this sector, which is accompanied by an increase of RES for the production of that 
electricity. On the other hand, the improvement of the energy efficiency through the implementation of 
measures in this sector in the WAM scenario contributes to a final energy consumption of 27% lower in 
2050 compared to the WEM scenario, so the final energy consumption remains at the same level during 
the planning period. The emissions in the WAM scenario have a drastic reduction of about 46% in 2050 
compared to 2017 which is also a result of more intensive penetration of fuels with lower emission factors 
(electricity, natural gas and RES) and reduced use of oil in this sector. As is the case for the household 
sector, the direct emissions from the commercial and services sector are very small considering that 
electricity is the main energy source. Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan

Figure 16. Final energy consumption by fuels in the commercial and services sector 
4. 2. 6  T ot al  ener gy resul t s 
The analysis shows that the final energy consumption in the WEM scenario will grow for 1.3 Mtoe by 2050 
or by 73% compared to 2017 (Figure 17). Currently, 1/3 of the final energy is consumed by the transport 
sector, another third by the residential sector, 21% by the industry, 12% by the commercial sector, and 
around 1% in agriculture. By 2050, the highest increase is estimated for consumption in the industry sector 
(from 0.4 Mtoe to 1.2 Mtoe), which is related to the GDP growth projections. Over the analysed period, a 
significant increase of 55% (around 0.3 Mtoe) is also estimated for the consumption in the transport sector. 
The consumption in the commercial sector will grow for 0.08 Mtoe and in the residential sector for 0.07 
Mtoe, which represents an increase of 38% and 13%, respectively, over the period 2017 - 2050. In terms 
of the share in the final energy consumption in 2050, the highest share will have the industry sector – 38%, 
followed by the transport sector – 30%, then the residential sector with 21% and commercial sector with 
10%, while the remaining 1% will be for the agriculture sector. 
In the case of the WAM scenario, the total final energy demand will rise by 38% (or 0.7 Mtoe) over the 
analysed period, but it will be 20% lower compared to the WEM scenario in 2050. This is mainly a result 
of  the  introduction  of  more  advanced  and  highly  efficient  technologies  at  the  demand  side.  The 
consumption in the industry will again have the highest increase, from 0.4 Mtoe in 2017 to 0.9 Mtoe in 
2050, while the consumption in the transport will grow for almost 0.2 Mtoe (or 33% increase relative to 
2017). The consumption in the commercial sector will remain almost at the same level, while in the 
residential sector it is estimated that will drop for 0.04 Mtoe (or 8% compared to 2017). Regarding their 
share in the final energy demand in 2050, the industry sector will participate with 36%, the transport sector 
will account for 32%, the residential sector will represent 21%, and the commercial sector 9%, while the 
remaining 2% will be for the agriculture sector. Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan

Figure 17. Final energy consumption per sector 
Considering  the  final  energy  demand  by  fuel,  in  the  WEM  scenario,  the  electricity  and  diesel  will 
predominate, and after 2030, the utilization of natural gas and coal will gradually increase. The biomass 
consumption will slightly increase. The share of electricity in the total final energy consumption is around 
30% over the entire period, while the share of the diesel will drop from 32% in 2017 to 23% in 2050. On 
the other hand, the shares of natural gas and coal will increase from 1% and 8% in 2017 to 7% and 16% 
in 2050, respectively. The share of the biomass will decrease from 13% in 2015 to 9% in 2050. The other 
fuels, mainly oil products (like gasoline, LPG, HFO, etc.), will account for remaining less than 20% (Figure 
17).  
The electricity and diesel will also dominate the final energy consumption in the WAM scenario, and the 
natural gas will be used instead of coal. In absolute values, the demand for all fuels will be at a lower level 
compared to the WEM scenario. Regarding their share in the total final demand, in 2050 the electricity will 
account for 33%, the diesel 20%, natural gas 17%, biomass 11%, and the remaining less than 20% will 
comprise the other fuels.

GHG emissions by sectors are presented in two ways. One is in terms of IPCC methodology. The 
disadvantage of this methodology is that emissions from electricity imports are not taken into account, 
which is of great importance for an import-dependent country like Republic of North Macedonia. According 
to this methodology, with the introduction of the measures, it can happen that there is no reduction of 
emissions in Republic of North Macedonia because the import of electricity would be reduced (which is not 
considered in the total emissions anyway). To overcome this shortcoming, the results are presented in a 
way that includes emissions from both aviation and electricity import (considered as Memo items). 
Analysing the GHG emissions by sector, including the emissions for the international aviation and the 
electricity import , in the WEM scenario, the total emissions are rising from 9 Mt in 2017 to 10.6 Mt in 2050 
(or 18%), mainly as a result of the increase in the emissions from the industry and transport (Figure 18). 
In 2017, almost half of the total GHG emissions (46%) originated from electricity and heat production, 20% 
came from the transport sector, 10% from the industry and around 16% are related to the electricity import. 
The emission level estimated for the electricity import is also relevant, albeit it reduces over the period due 
to the increased domestic electricity production. Regarding the sectoral contribution to the total GHG 
emissions in 2050, electricity and heat production account for 35%, followed by industry with 27%, 
transport with 22%, electricity import with 9%, and the other sectors contribute the remaining 7%. 
In the WAM scenario, the total emissions are estimated to drop by 46% in 2050 compared to 2017, or by 
54% compared to the WEM scenario. The decommissioning of the lignite power plants due to the high 
carbon price and their replacement with RES will result in a 93% reduction of emissions from the electricity 
and heat production sector. Although the emissions from the industry sector are estimated to rise over the 
analysed period (for 26%), their level is lower compared to the WEM scenario. On the other hand, the 
emissions from the transport sector are estimated to slightly reduce as a result of the introduction of more 
advanced technologies using less carbon-intensive fuels.

For projection of the emissions of the Industrial Processes, the main assumption is that they depend on 
the added value of the corresponding industry type. Therefore, a correlation between the historical data Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan  
 
for the added value and the GHG emissions from each industry type is made. As the emissions from the 
Product Use as substitutes for ODS mainly depend on imported appliances (such as refrigerators and air-
conditioners) it is assumed that these emissions depend on the GDP. Again, a correlation of the historical 
values for the GHG emissions from the Product Use and the GDP in the same period is made. Using the 
obtained equations for the correlation and the projections for the added values in each industry and the 
GDP (the macroeconomic drivers), projections for the GHG emissions from this sector are made for the 
period up to 2050. No mitigation measures are proposed for this sector due to the time constrains and the 
absence of previous work on mitigation aspects in the sector IPPU. The definition of policies and measures 
in the IPPU sector requires detailed assessments on technological production processes which will be 
gradually gathered by the introduction of the EU ETS scheme which is foreseen under the Draft Law on 
Climate Action. 
 
4. 3. 2  T ot al  I PPU  r esul t s 
The results for the total GHG emissions for the IPPU sector show that there will be an increase for 143% 
in 2050 compared to 2017 in this sector, which is expected as there are no measures assumed for their 
mitigation. The highest increase is in the emissions from Product Use as Substitutes for ODS, which 
increase for almost four times.

For livestock, the main assumption is that the number of livestock will keep the same trend as in the period 
until 2040, except for goats which have a sharp downward trend until 2040 and whose number is projected 
to remain at the same level as in 2040. As noted in the TBUR, it is difficult to make long-term forecasts for 
land change from one type to another. Therefore, in the TBUR it is assumed that the trend from 2000-2016 
will continue in the period until 2040. In this Strategy the same trend is assumed until 2050. Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan  
 
4. 4. 2  T ot al  A FO LU r esul t s 
The AFOLU sector is of great importance because it is the only sector in which there are GHG removals 
and it includes a natural carbon-caption reservoir mainly from the Forestry. Projections until 2050 show 
that in the AFOLU sector the GHG removal will be increased for about 35% in 2050 compared to 2016 and 
this removal is mainly originating from Forestland (Figure 23). The use of biomass for Energy purposes is 
within the principles of sustainable use of biomass, i.e. there is less consumption of biomass than is the 
annual growth rate of the biomass in the forests. This is one of the reasons for the increase in sinks in this 
sector. The greatest problems in this sector are the forest fires that in certain years in the past caused the 
sector FOLU to become significant source of GHG emissions. The proposed measures for afforestation 
and integrated management of forest fires will contribute the GHG removals in 2050 to remain at similar 
level as in 2020. 
Furthermore, in the WAM scenario the emissions from the livestock will decrease by about 23% in 2050 
compared to 2016. The reduction is a result of implementation of measures for improved manure and 
nutrition management, as well as from the downward trend in the livestock population (especially the 
number of dairy cows that have the most significant role in the emissions). In addition, the measures 
proposed in the category Land use contribute to reduction of the emissions from this sector by about 28% 
in 2050 compared to 2016.

The major assumptions according to which the projections in this sector are made are based on the key 
drivers GDP and the population. Besides the population, another very important assumption for projecting 
the Municipal Solid Waste Disposal is the waste per capita (Figure 24). The projections for this variable 
are based on the data for the countries in the region, as well as the EU28 data. The major assumption is 
that the waste per capita in Republic of North Macedonia will increase linearly until it reaches the same 
amount of waste per capita as the linear projections of EU28 in 2035. Afterwards, in the next few years the 
increasing rate will slow down, and after 2038 it will start decreasing.  Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan

The composition of Municipal solid waste is assumed to remain the same during the whole period as it is 
for 2016, i.e. food – 36.7%, garden – 10.7%, paper – 10.8%, wood – 0.4%, textile – 3.7%, nappies – 5.0% 
and plastic, other inert – 32.6%. It is also assumed that the distribution of waste by waste management 
treatment will be equal to the distribution in 2016, for the whole period.  
For calculating the waste from the Industry, besides the GDP, for the Industrial wastewater, the data for 
the value added for the industry from the MARKAL model are used. For that purpose first the correlation 
between the Total organic degradable material in the wastewater from the Industry with the Industry value 
added is calculated (Figure 25) and using the obtained equation and the projection for the Industry value 
added, the projections for the Total organic degradable material in the wastewater from the Industry up to 
2050 are calculated (Figure 26).

In the WEM and WAM scenarios four measures are proposed for the Waste sector, and the following 
assumptions were made for their modelling: 
•  The existing illegal (‘wild’) dumpsites with very high, high and medium risk will be rehabilitated (covering and 
gas extraction and flaring) and new landfills will be opened by waste management regions in the following 
order: Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan  
 
o  Skopje – 2023 
o  East and Northeast – 2025 
o  Polog – 2026 
o  Southeast – 2029 
o  Pelagonija and Southwest – 2029 
o  Vardar - 2029 
•  Mechanical and biological treatment will be made in the new regional landfills with composting (from the 
Garden solid waste); 
•  Paper selection will gradually increase from 2% in 2021 up to 60% in 2050 of the total paper waste (this will 
change the Municipal Solid Waste composition, by reducing the share of paper); 
•  By including circular economy in the Industry, the waste treatment in this sector will increase from 0.1% in 
2021 up to 50% in 2050 
4. 5. 2  T ot al  w ast e r esul t s 
The results show that the highest GHG emission reduction will be achieved by covering the existing wild 
dumpsites and the opening of the regional landfills in the period 2023- 2029 (Figure 27). By gas extraction 
and flaring in the existing dumpsites the CO  emissions will increase in the following period , but the total 
2
GHG emissions will be drastically reduced. By Mechanical and biological treatment of the Garden waste, 
the emissions for Biological treatment will be increased, but at the same time the solid Waste Disposal 
emissions will be reduced compared to a situation without this measure. Although the measures Selection 
of waste - paper and the Improved waste and materials management at industrial facilities reduce the 
emissions in the period from 2020-2050 compared to a scenario with no measures, the total emissions 
after 2030 start to increase. This is mainly due to the waste from the Industry. On one hand, as the GDP 
grows, the emissions from the Industrial Wastewater increase as there is no measure proposed for this 
sector. Although there is a measure in the solid waste from the Industry, the emissions from this sector 
also increase, because the emissions in a certain year are based on the accumulated waste from the 
previous years. Thus, the effect of the reduction of solid waste from the Industry is even more visible in the 
period after 2050. However, the increase in the period 2020-2050 is with a much slower rate compared to 
a scenario with no measure. 
The emissions from the Domestic Wastewater and from Open burning will decrease mainly as a result of 
the decrease of the population and the waste per capita.  
Most of the GHG emissions from the Waste sector are emissions of CH4, but after 2025 the CO  emissions 
2
start to increase due to introduction of the process of flaring (Figure 28).

The total emissions in the WEM scenario are reduced by about 14% in 2050 compared to 1990 (Figure 
29). Even though the emissions from the Energy and IPPU sectors increase, the emissions reduction is a 
result of GHG removals by the FOLU sector. The total emissions in the WAM scenario are reduced by 
61% in 2050 relative to 1990. This is primarily a result of the decommissioning of TPP Oslomej and TPP 
Bitola. 
If emissions from electricity imports are excluded (Figure 30), and given that there was no electricity imports 
in 1990, the reduction in total emissions is even greater (around 23% in WEM and 72% in WAM in 2050 
compared to 1990). 
Despite all the measures proposed in the WAM scenario, still, after 2030, an upward trend of emissions is 
maintained, which is primarily due to the IPPU sector in which, as previously emphasized, no mitigation 
measures are proposed. Therefore, if this sector is excluded from the total net GHG emissions, the total 
reductions reach 90% in 2050 compared to the 1990 level in the WAM scenario.

A reduction of net emissions by at least 82% in 2030 compared to 1990 in the WAM scenario requires: 
•  Reduction of emissions from the Energy sector by 66% 
•  Increase of emissions from the IPPU by no more than 45% 
•  Reduction of emissions from the Agriculture by 29% 
•  Increase of the removals from the FOLU sector by about 18 times (which although appears to be drastic,

   5. ADAPTATION MEASURESLong-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan  
 
5.  AD APT AT I ON  MEASUR ES 
A  wealth  of  information  on  climate  change  impacts  as  well  as  on measures  to  adapt  and  reduce 
vulnerability to such impacts is available in the country. However, the line between adaptation and 
maladaptation* may be fine when the subject matter in on the intersection of ecosystems and human 
activity. 
For most situations, specific adaptation interventions need to be defined at the lowest level possible, so as 
to ensure the full integration of all relevant aspects (such as exposure and vulnerability to the climate 
impact of a given system, taking into consideration physical aspects, including geography and location; 
socio-economic parameters such as demography, health and cultural dimensions; as well as economic 
aspects). Up to date, solid and regularly collected data (before, during and after implementation) is in most 
such cases crucial for successful adaptation action. 
The adaptation measures contained in this Strategy are limited and mainly aimed at addressing the key 
barriers and gaps identified in the Third National Communication. The reason for this is the fact that the 
PSC decided the Strategy and its Action Plan to focus on climate change mitigation measures and policies, 
while the NAP, which is currently in final phase of application for funding by the Green Climate Fund, will 
focus on comprehensive adaptation policies and measures. In addition to this, sectoral adopted strategies 
in  the  fields  of  biodiversity  and  nature  protection  address  climate  adaptation  measures,  while  the 
vulnerability assessments are already addressed in the national communications developed so far. In 
addition, link between water and climate sector is already addressed in the Law on waters, as well as in 
the proposals for development of new or updated river basis management plans. Taking all of this into 
account, the scope of this chapter within the long term strategy is focus on addressing of key barriers and 
gaps and providing an enabling environment for climate adaptation.  
Despite the fact that Republic of North Macedonia has put a lot of effort on scientifically sound information, 
there are still gaps that constitute barriers to the full understanding required for adaptation planning and 
action in key sectors such as water resources, agriculture, biodiversity, human health and socio-economic 
development.  For  these  sectors,  specific  data  and  information  gaps,  including  fragile  cooperative 
mechanism for sharing and dissemination, have been identified, mostly related to the granularity and detail 
of the data, which allows for the definition measures at a lower level and that will allow for a regular 
monitoring and impact of the measures, once implemented. The objective of this strategy is to address 
and close such data gaps, to contribute to the country’s readiness to define, implement and monitor 
measures to adapt to climate change impacts through the National Adaptation Plan.  
In order to achieve the specific objective 5 of this strategy: To build solid systems for the regular and 
periodic collection data for the production and dissemination of scientific and technical knowledge, the 
following measures are defined: 
•  Water resources: Pilot project for the collection of data on water use in rural context for the purpose 
of ensuring effective adaptation to climate change 
•  Agriculture:  Cooperation  Among  Scientific  Institutions  and  Enhance  the  Science-Policy-
Implementers Link 
•  Biodiversity: Define and develop an indicator system to monitor the impacts of climate change on 
biodiversity and to define a national research plan for biodiversity and climate change 
•  Human Health: Restore and improve the system for the collection of air-climate-health data, 
including the platform for sharing it with the public 
 
*   Maladaptation: when the implementation of an adaptation measures results in the increase rather than on the decrease of 
vulnerability to a certain climate change impact. Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan  
 
•  Socio-economic  Development:  Define  and  develop  a  system  to  monitor  socio-economic 
vulnerability to climate change 
Water resources 
Pilot project for the collection of data on water use in rural context for the purpose of ensuring effective 
adaptation to climate change 
This measure specifically aims at addressing the following needs and gaps identified in the Third National 
Communication: 
•  Lack of knowledge about the extent of groundwater irrigation, and there is an urgent need for 
mapping/inventory of existing irrigation wells 
•  There are no reliable data on water consumed for irrigation. Most irrigation schemes do not have 
measuring devices at the level of intakes, river diversions or canal outlets 
Taking into consideration the Water Strategy for the Republic of Republic of North Macedonia – Final Draft 
Version (2010) and the Law on Waters, in particular its section VI – Water Monitoring, a pilot project for 
the collection of data on water use in rural context, for the purposes of ensuring effective adaptation to 
climate change is to be implemented. The information available on ground water aquifers; the number of 
wells and of its use (it is not sufficient to know the number of wells, but whether or not water is actually 
extracted from them); the areas of irrigation using surface and underground water; and on the amount of 
irrigation  water  lost  through  evaporation  and  leakages  is  insufficient  for  a  rigorous  assessment  of 
vulnerability and to the definition of sound policies for the management of water resources in the context 
of climate change.  
The  lack  of  this  information  makes  it  impossible  to  actually  determine  the  vulnerability  of  specific 
geographic  locations  to  the  impacts  of  climate  change,  taking  into  account  the  climate  scenarios 
downscaled to the level of the country. While there is sufficient information on the exposition to the climate 
change  impact  (mostly  provided  through  historical  and  projected  precipitation  patterns),  the  actual 
vulnerability can only be assessed with site specific data on water needs, water use and water availability 
to meet the needs. 
In the scope of this measure, the following activities are to be implemented: 
1.  Define the boundaries of the pilot, in particular in terms of geographic coverage 
2.  Inventory and map wells, including the identification of its main use (irrigation or other). For this, good 
practices shall be considered, such as 
a)  digital field mapping, where the relevant features are observed, analysed, and recorded in the field, 
producing spatially referenced maps  
b)  field work aided by and to complement / validate the results of the digital field mapping, with a view 
to collecting/validating, for example, data on: well location, status (operational / non-operational), 
depth to groundwater, groundwater quality. 
3.  Identify needs and determine measures for the improvement of the monitoring of irrigation water use 
in order to 
a)  Determine the area under irrigation with surface and groundwater  
b)  Enhance the coverage of measuring devices at the level of intakes, river diversions or canal outlets 
c)  Set up a system / methodological approach to estimate irrigation water losses through leakage and 
evaporation 
4.  Define and implement a methodological approach for the monitoring of groundwater aquifers within the 
boundaries of the pilot project. 
Agriculture Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan  
 
Promote Cooperation among Scientific Institutions and Enhance the Science-Policy-Implementers Link 
This measure specifically aims at addressing the following needs and gaps identified in the Third National 
Communication: 
•  Weak networking and an insufficient level of cooperation between scientific institutions 
Adapting to climate change in agriculture requires the vertical integration of scientific knowledge creation 
and dissemination. It is of the utmost importance that the research community answers the policy making 
needs for scientific knowledge and that the results of this policy-driven research reach the most important 
agents in this sector: the farmers. 
The work undertaken under this measure should be mindful of the work being done under measure Define 
a national research plan for biodiversity (including agrobiodiversity) and climate change, namely on what 
agrobiodiversity is concerned. 
In the scope of this measure, the following activities are to be implemented: 
1.  Identify the institutions performing research on agriculture and climate change 
2.  Define  and  establish  a  coordination,  communication  and  knowledge  management  mechanism, 
including web-based, that promotes synergies among research institutions and enhances the link and 
communication among research institutions, policy makers, extension services and farmers, including 
civil society organizations 
This coordination and communication mechanism shall, to the extent the availability of the technology and 
expertise in Republic of North Macedonia, rely on artificial intelligence technologies, which facilitate the 
collection and dissemination of relevant information, including matching information demand with supply. 
The core of this mechanism is to be a database aimed at managing knowledge, and a communication / 
interaction mechanism that, using artificial intelligence technologies, may be based on a ChatBot (a 
software programmed to typically perform repetitive tasks, such as answering frequently asked questions) 
or SocialBot (running over social media platforms). These artificial intelligence BOTs are able to deliver 
results in a more integrated manner by using algorithms, then by simply searching for key words.  
Biodiversity 
Define and develop an indicator system to monitor the impacts of climate change on biodiversity 
This measure specifically aims at addressing the following needs and gaps identified in the Third National 
Communication: 
•  Lack of data for precise distribution of different species, population density and abundance; 
Vegetation  map  -  communities  and  habitats;  Insufficient  definition  of  biogeographical 
characteristics of Macedonian territory; 
•  Lack of data on vulnerable biodiversity components to climate change; 
•  A monitoring system of climate change impacts on biodiversity does not exist; 
•  Lack of good intersectoral cooperation (partially) 
•  Insufficient capacities (human and knowledge); (partially) 
Climate change may have significant impacts on biodiversity. Indicators can help illustrate this impact and 
make it more easily understandable for policy makers and the general public.  
Data availability for indicator development is insufficient, not only in Republic of North Macedonia, but in 
most  countries.  Therefore,  the  indicator  system  under  this  measure  needs  to  be  mindful  of  such 
constraints. With that in mind, the following aspects shall be determinant in the choice of indicators to 
monitor the impacts of climate change on biodiversity: 
•  Purpose: what aspect of vulnerability / adaptation is the indicator to monitor? Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan  
 
•  Relevance: the indicator is to provide relevant information for the decision-making process and / or 
for the monitoring of a specific adaptation action. 
•  Resources and capacities are to be available for the regular and accurate collection, management, 
and analysis of the data for the indicator. This includes choosing indicators for which data is more 
readily available over indicators for which greater data collection efforts will be required. 
•  Alignment and synergies with data collected for any other relevant purposes. 
In the scope of this measure, the following activities are to be implemented: 
1)  Define policy relevant key indicators for evaluation of impacts of climate change on biodiversity 
a)  Assess data needs and data availability and gaps, including resources needed to address needs 
and gaps 
2)  Design and establish monitoring system for the impacts of climate change on biodiversity, including 
institutional responsibilities 
Define a national research plan for biodiversity and climate change 
This measure specifically aims at addressing the following needs and gaps identified in the Third National 
Communication*: 
•  Lack of data for precise distribution of different species, population density and abundance; 
Vegetation  map  -  communities  and  habitats;  Insufficient  definition  of  biogeographical 
characteristics of Macedonian territory; 
•  Lack of good intersectoral cooperation (partially) 
•  Insufficient capacities (human and knowledge); (partially) 
Biodiversity’s  vulnerability  to  climate  change  is  well  established  globally  and  in  Republic  of  North 
Macedonia. More so than for other sectors, the vulnerability assessment and definition of adaptation 
measures is greatly dependant on scientific knowledge. Ensuring that the research community answers 
the policy making needs for scientific knowledge is of the utmost importance. In order to promote such 
science-policy link, a research plan for biodiversity, including agrobiodiversity, and climate change is to be 
elaborated. 
The goals of the research plan for biodiversity, including agrobiodiversity, and climate change are to 
include: 
•  Identification of important gaps in the information needed by sectoral decision-makers to respond 
to climate change in ways that reduce the vulnerability of biodiversity to the impacts of climate 
change; 
•  Set adaptation research priorities based on these gaps; 
•  Identify capacity that can be harnessed or that needs development in order to perform priority 
adaptation research. 
In defining research priorities, the following criteria shall be taken into consideration: 
•  Severity of potential impact or degree of potential benefit 
•  Immediacy of required intervention or response 
•  Need to change intervention or practicality of intervention 
•  Potential for co-benefit 
 
*   The needs and gaps addressed by these measures are partially the same as those addressed by the previous measure. Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan  
 
•  Potential to address multiple, including cross-sectoral, issues 
In addition, the engagement of all relevant stakeholders in the definition of the research priorities shall be 
assured, following a collaborative research approach, in which the priority research topics will help meet 
key stakeholder information needs. In this context, as for the definition of indicators in the previous 
measure, the policy relevance and the materiality of the purpose of the research shall be crucial in the 
definition of priorities. 
The work undertaken under this measure should be mindful of the work being done under the Measure 
Promote Cooperation among Scientific Institutions and Enhance the Science-Policy-Implementers Link 
In the scope of this measure, the following activity is to be implemented: 
1.  Elaborate a research plan for biodiversity, including agrobiodiversity, and climate change 
Human Health 
Restore and improve the system for the collection of air-climate-health data, including the platform for 
sharing it with the public  
This measure specifically aims at addressing a need identified during the elaboration of this strategy, 
related  to  the  unsustainability  of  the  solution  previously  implemented  for  assuring  a  real  time 
communication among the key health-meteorology organizations. 
Accurate real-time or close to real-time data and the capacity to make information (such as alerts for events 
such as heat or cold waves or exceeding of air quality thresholds) available to the wider public is key for 
the adaptive capacity in the human health sector. 
Republic of North Macedonia’s capacity in the area of interaction between climate change and human 
health is high, nonetheless efforts are required to restore it to previous levels, namely through bringing 
back online the communication platform among the Hydrometeorological Service, the Public Health 
Institute and the general public. 
Furthermore, the integration of relevant meteorological/climatological, air quality and health data (including 
morbidity and mortality) is fundamental to allow for an adequate response to the public health emergencies 
accruing from climate change in the present and in the future. 
In the scope of this measure, the following activities are to be implemented: 
1.  Define technical specifications for the server required to restore the existing automated platform 
2.  Define the technical specifications for improving the platform, including: 
a.  Selection of meteorological, air quality and public health parameters 
b.  Identify data needs and gaps 
c.  Identify  needs  to  strengthen  the  system  for  data  collection,  analysis  and  dissemination 
(including weather and air quality stations and procedures for the reporting and morbidity and 
mortality associated with weather events) 
3.  Prepare a roll out plan, including, if relevant, the definition of a phased approach for implementation  
4.  Prepare the Terms of Reference for the acquisition of hardware and software 
Socio-economic vulnerability 
Define and develop a system to monitor socio-economic vulnerability to climate change 
This measure specifically aims at addressing the following needs and gaps identified in the Third National 
Communication: 
•  Inaccurate statistical data for some statistical units, particularly at the settlement level, because the 
Census of Population, Households and Dwellings was not conducted in 2011. Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan  
 
•  Certain data in the field of health, social care, employment, etc., are not available at the municipal 
level due to the method of processing and disclosure of relevant institutions. The above information 
is processed and disseminated at the level of 30 centres. The official statistical data on incomes 
and expenditures of households, poverty, socially excluded groups and related indicators are 
available only as totals for the Republic of Republic of North Macedonia as a whole and are not 
disaggregated. 
•  Comparability of data over time is not possible due to changes in applied methodology and changes 
in the administrative divisions in which the census data are published. 
•  Limiting factors meant that the composite socio-economic index could not include indicators on the 
economic situation of the population, such as the unemployment rate and the level of household 
income. 
The assessment of socio-economic vulnerability to climate change involves assessing the vulnerability of 
a region to a hazard based only on its social and economic status. It is the probable vulnerability of a place 
and its people to a hazard. It is assumed that better the socio-economic status of a place (meaning, of a 
people, of a community), lesser will be its vulnerability towards disasters, and better and faster will be its 
coping mechanisms.  
An index-based vulnerability assessment is a comprehensive tool that helps in comparing and ranking 
areas, cities, regions or communities in terms of vulnerability, thus facilitating priority setting and the 
definition of adaptation measures targeted at the specific vulnerabilities of each community. These 
rankings are to be developed by combining indicators, to which different weights may be attributed 
depending on its contribution to the community’s vulnerability. These composite indices reduce complex 
information from multiple variables to a single variable, thus facilitating the policy and decision-making 
process. 
Indicators of social and economic status can include the region’s per capita income; demographic structure 
(e.g. percentage of less privileged or dependent population like women, children, elderly and disabled); 
availability and extent of access to public amenities (e.g. institutional stability and strength of public 
infrastructure). 
The collection of the required data needs to be done in a systematic way, ensuring that priority is given to 
key indicators to be identified in the scope of the activities to be performed under this measure. 
Activities 
1)  Define policy relevant key indicators for evaluation of the socio-economic vulnerability to the impacts 
of climate change 
2)  Define parameters and rules for the establishment of community-specific indexes 
3)  Determine data needs and gaps for the accurate socio-economic characterization of the impacts of 
climate change 
4)  Identify data providers 
5)  Establish a system for the periodic, systematic and consistent collection of data 
In order to achieve Specific objective 6: To increase the resilience of climate change impacts of key 
socio-economic sectors and ecosystems, the following measure is defined. 
Prepare the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) 
The preparation and adoption of the National Adaptation Plan, in accordance with the technical guidelines 
for the national adaptation plan process prepared under the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change (UNFCCC), will endow Republic of North Macedonia with the required tools to implement 
key adaptation measures to reduce vulnerability and increase resilience to climate change. Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan  
 
The NAP should take into consideration the climate scenarios, vulnerability and impact assessment and 
the adaptation measures contained in the most recent national communication to the UNFCCC. 
The activities for the preparation of the NAP are to be planned and implemented in accordance with the 
international requirements under the UNFCCC and in accordance with the project submitted to the Green 
Climate Fund.

Climate change and some aspects of sustainable development are, to a certain extent, incorporated in the 
educational curriculum of some national academic institutions. However, climate is still not adequately 
incorporated in the overall national educational system. Four public universities and their faculties, as well 
as some private universities, have undergraduate and postgraduate programmes related to climate change 
and sustainable development. 
The interest for these studies is continuously growing. National authorities should aim at continuously 
improve the educational curriculum and to establish links with foreign educational institutions working on 
climate and sustainable development issues. This would enable the exchange of good practices, improve 
the national educational curriculum, as well as create opportunities for Macedonian faculty and students 
to spent time working or studying in internationally recognised academic centres. 
Education, R&D and innovation are very important national drivers to mainstream climate action. Currently, 
there is no systematic approach to foster climate aspects on all levels of the educational system. However, 
the country has made significant investments to support national academic institutions and the scientific 
community dealing with climate research. Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan  
 
It is fundamental to mainstream climate change related aspects into future national strategic planning 
documents related to education, R&D and innovation. This would assure the systematic and harmonised 
integration of climate related aspects into the national educational, R&D and innovation ecosystem, as well 
as increase educational and research capacities and climate awareness. The most important national 
strategic documents that should integrate climate related aspects are the future National Strategy for 
Education and the National Innovation Strategy. 
The strategic integration of climate change at all levels of the educational system should include the 
provision of additional funding for climate related research activities, to raise public awareness, and to 
establish centres of excellence and research institutes. 
The country is considered the most prominent and experienced in the region when it comes to national 
capacities for reporting towards the UNFCCC. Besides, Republic of North Macedonia was the first country 
of the Energy Community Contracting Parties to submit its National Energy and Climate Plan. The MoEPP 
and the UNDP, as a supporting partner of the Ministry when it comes to reporting towards the UNFCCC, 
made efforts to institutionalize cooperation with certain research and educational institutions in order to 
assure a long-term partnership and continuous support to the government regarding climate change 
issues. 
However, a lot more has to be done to assure that the R&D community will be well positioned to support 
national authorities in the processes of informed decision making and evidence-based policy creation. 
Climate mainstreaming in the country may be significantly improved by enhanced institutional capacities 
and  the  establishment  of  sound  mechanisms  for  inter-sectoral  cooperation.  Currently,  the  climate 
capacities of the MoEPP are limited, especially in terms of technical expertise for reporting towards 
international organisations, as well as for monitoring and reporting of policies, measures and projections.  
When  it comes  to  innovation  in  the  field  of  climate  change, many  things  have  been  initiated  and 
implemented in the last few years. The Fund for Innovation and Technology Development was established 
in 2017 and a Support Instrument of the Fund was launched in order to support innovative and improved 
technologies, know-how and technology processes, and to encourage different forms of collaboration 
among  small  and medium  enterprises (SMEs),  business  associations,  clusters  and/or  chambers  of 
commerce.  
However, the capacity need assessment* done in the framework of the Project has also demonstrated that 
all line ministries need capacities and knowledge to be fully capable to integrate climate change aspects 
into their sectoral plans and programs. This means that climate consideration should be brought higher on 
the political agenda of the Government in order for the country to allocate the necessary funds to engage 
additional human capacities at all levels.

According to the Third Environmental Progress Review of Republic of North Macedonia, and in line with 
the observations of the Project team, overall climate awareness in the country remains limited. The lack of 
financial and human capacities for the systematic support of climate awareness raising in the country limit 
the outreach of the MoEPP. Currently, most climate related awareness raising activities are supported by 
donor funded initiatives. 
Awareness-raising should be a horizontal priority in all policies and measures used to promote climate 
action  in  Republic  of  North  Macedonia.  Growing  societal  awareness  and  appreciation  can  drive 
enhancement of socio-cultural and/or environmental values in the context of climate change and build up 
momentum for overarching climate mitigation and adaptation action. 
The Project team considers that climate awareness is exceptionally low among the general public, but 
sufficient at institutional level. The comparatively higher degree of awareness among institutions might be

explained by the extensive efforts of national authorities, the donor community and NGOs, which have 
worked on issues related to climate in the country for more than 10 years. 
Climate action is necessary to promote nature conservation, innovation, and sustainable development. 
The  awareness-raising  process  should  be  systematic  and  build  society  and  policy-makers’ 
knowledgebase,  contributing  to  mainstreaming  climate  action  and  ensuring  that  policy  options  are 
optimised. 
Climate action’s success ultimately depends on the engagement of all stakeholders. Intensive science-
policy dialogues and new approaches and tools to involve the public and business sector are essential to 
raise climate awareness and successfully implement climate action in the country. 
The Strategy defines measures for climate mitigation and adaptation directed to the public. These 
measures aim to make climate change education a central and visible element of the international 
response to climate change. Climate change education would increase climate literacy, raise awareness, 
and strengthen relevant national capacities.

The Third Environmental Performance Review of Republic of North Macedonia was published in 2019. 
This review report made a comprehensive evaluation of the state of climate mainstreaming and climate 
awareness of the country, as well as the state of the education sector regarding the integration of 
sustainable development aspects. 
This Strategy reiterates the Recommendation 7.7 of the Third Environmental Performance Review of 
Republic of North Macedonia, as it follows: 
The Government should: 
(a) Regularly and systematically implement measures aimed at raising awareness on climate-change-
related issues; 
(b) Ensure that climate-change-related issues are integrated into primary, secondary and tertiary curricula. 
In addition, this Strategy recommends the implementation of an expanded list of measures for enhanced 
climate mainstreaming in the sector Education, R&D, innovation and awareness rising. The additional 
measures are divided among the following two categories:

   7. KEY INDICATORSLong-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan  
 
7.  K E Y   I N D I C A T OR S  
The Strategy, with its policies and measures, supports the implementation of the UN 2030 Agenda of 
Sustainable development and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). SDG13 is devoted to Climate 
Action and has an impact in the achievement of all other SDGs goals. Despite the challenges, climate 
action presents a huge economic opportunity, having in mind that that green economic policies have to 
ensure a ‘Just Transition’* for workers coming from less environmentally friendly industries so no one is 
left behind. Since electricity generation and the use of primary energy are the biggest contributors 
to GHG emissions in Republic of North Macedonia, the transformation of the Energy sector is on a 
critical pathway on the transition towards carbon neutrality enshrined in the Strategy’s vision. It is very 
notable that the country is making significant progress towards the achievement of the national energy 
efficiency and renewable energy targets, which at the same time brings a number of co-benefits including 
improved economic indicators, improved air quality and reduced health impact caused the local pollution. 
In order to present the combined effects of the policies and measures included in the Strategy’s WAM 
scenario on SDGs, specific indicators addressing SDGs 7 (Affordable and clean Energy) and 13 (Climate 
action) have been developed. Besides, an additional set of indicators that evaluate the low carbon 
development and carbon transition of Republic of North Macedonia (NM-WAM) in the context of and in 
comparison with the EU 2016 Reference scenario† are presented. 
The key indicators for comparison are as follows: 
a) GHG emissions per capita (t of CO -eq./capita)

†   The EU Reference Scenario is a projection of where EU’s current set of policies (EU Climate/Environmental/Energy Acquis) 
coupled with market trends are likely to lead. EU Member States for comparison were selected according to geographical 
relevance (EU Member States in the Balkan: BG-Bulgaria, RO-Romania, HL-Greece and HR-Croatia), size of population (SI-
Slovenia), and ability to invest (AT-Austria). Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan  
 
The GHG emissions per capita indicator of Republic of North Macedonia is 4,9 t CO eq./capita, well below 
2
the EU28 average, which is 8 t CO eq./capita. With the implementation of the measures included in the 
2-
WAM scenario, the indicator is projected to further decrease to 3,0 t CO eq./capita by 2030, and to 
2-
increase to 3,9 t CO eq./capita by 2050. 
2-
While GHG emissions per capita are well below the EU28 average, the GHG emissions pre unit of GDP is 
almost 4 times higher than the EU28 average and is comparable with the GHG emissions per unit of GDP 
of Bulgaria. With the implementation of the measures included in the WAM scenario, this indicator is 
projected to significantly decrease and reach the levels of EU Member States from the region by 2030 and 
2050. The most significant contributions to the reduction of emissions considered by this indicator are 
related to the foreseen mitigation measures and structural changes related to the Energy sector.

The phasing out of the coal power plants, stronger penetration of renewables and, to some extent, natural 
gas, as well as increased energy efficiency by 2030 is well reflected in the carbon intensity of the gross 
inland energy consumption. This indicator is projected to decline below the EU28 levels and to be in the 
same range as comparable EU Member States from the region. In parallel to this indicator, the Gross 
inland consumption per GDP is also projected to decrease and be in the same range as comparable EU 
Member States from the region. 
The increase in the use of renewable energy sources is also one of the indicators showing the transition 
to low carbon society and contributing to the achievement of the SDG – Affordable and clean energy.

WAM scenario  scenario 
In the WAM scenario, the RES share in gross final energy consumption is estimated to reach 23% by 2020, 
43% by 2030, and 49% by 2050. The projected RE share is much higher than any of the comparable 
countries and well above the EU28 Reference scenario target value set under the 2030 Climate and 
Energy Framework (32%). 
Regarding the penetration of RES in the Transport sector, the country is currently well behind the EU28 
average of 11%, which is projected to increase to 14%. by 2030. The RES share of the Transport sector 
of Republic of North Macedonia is projected to sharply increase from 2% in 2020 to 17% by 2030, and 
20% by 2050. Taking into account that the projected RES share above 10% is predominately driven by the 
penetration of electric and hydrogen powered vehicles, and considering the fact that the penetration of 
these technologies is driven by consumer purchase power, it can be concluded that the achievement of 
the RES goal for the Transport sector will be challenging. 
Energy security and households’ consumption indicators 
Taking  into  account  the  carbon  transition  and  the  decarbonisation  of  electricity  production,  import 
dependency is an important indicator to measure the exposure of the country to the price of external energy 
commodities such as oil & petroleum products, natural gas and electricity. The current import dependency 
of Republic of North Macedonia is slightly below the EU28 and above the import dependency of Bulgaria 
and Romania, which is an important consideration from the regional market perspective. Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan

2030 and 2050 – WAM scenario  households per capita for 2020, 2030 and 2050 – 
WAM scenario 
It is projected that the import dependency will slightly increase to 53,5% by 2030 and to 52,6% by 2050. 
The domestic phasing out of lignite, which is extensively replaced with RES, is also reflected in the 
projected reduction of electricity imports by 63%, by 2050, compared to 2017 levels. 
On the other hand, the final consumption of imported energy commodities such as oil and natural gas are 
projected to increase by 2030 tenfold and by 2050 more than seventeen-fold compared to 2017 levels, 
while total final consumption is to increase by 38,3% by 2050 compared to 2017 levels. In households, 
final energy consumption is projected to decrease by 5,7% by 2030 and by 7,7% by 2050 compared to 
2017 levels. Since the demographic projection by 2050 also have a declining trend, the final energy 
consumption in households per capita will be maintained at about 270-280 toe per capita, which is among 
the lowest consumption among the EU Member States* with the exception of Malta.

For realization of a transition towards low-carbon society in Republic of North Macedonia around 19 Bill. 
EUR of cumulative capital investments are needed in the period 2020-2050 (WEM scenario), while for an 
enhanced transition (WAM scenario) around 35 Bill. EUR are needed (Figure 42). The Energy sector 
(supply and demand side + infrastructure) accounts for about 99% of the total investments in both WEM 
and WAM scenarios. The total cumulative investments in the AFOLU sector are about 115 mil. EUR, while 
the total investments in the Waste sector are about 67 mil. EUR in both scenarios. As stated in Chapter 4, 
no measures are proposed in the IPPU sector, so no capital investments are assumed in this sector. It can 
be noted that the total investments in the WAM scenario are almost doubled compared to the WEM 
scenario.

As the Energy sector has the highest share in the investments needed for realization of the both scenarios, 
more detailed data on investments in this sector by category is provided in Figure 43 and Figure 44. For 
implementation of the WEM scenario, the Energy system would need a cumulative capital investment of 
18.5 bil. EUR until 2050, while the WAM scenario can be implemented with cumulative capital investment 
of 34.1 bill. EUR. . The focus in both scenarios is on the capital investments in energy efficiency, followed 
by investments in RES generation. To accept the increased use of RES in the WAM scenario capital 
investments would be also needed in the energy system infrastructure. Detailed investments per measure 
in the WAM scenario are given in Table 4. Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan

However, in order to calculate the cost of transition, the total Energy system costs are very important, 
which besides the investments, also include the operation and maintenance costs (at both supply and 
demand side), fuel supply + carbon costs and delivery costs (Figure 45). In the Energy sector, it is 
estimated that in the WEM scenario the annual system costs would increase from 2.6 bil. EUR in 2018 to 
6.2 bil. EUR in 2050. The majority of the expenditures are fuel supply costs and investments in technologies 
on the demand side, both comprising 67% of the total annual costs in 2020 and increasing their share to 
69% in 2050. 
The most important results for the transition of the Macedonian Energy system is that in the case of WAM 
scenario, the cumulative system costs are for 12% lower compared to the WEM scenario. Although the 
investment costs in the WAM scenario are higher, the significantly lower cost of fuel supply makes this 
scenario more cost-effective than the WEM scenario. Additionally, in the WAM scenario, the higher 
utilization of RES potential (especially on the supply side) and more efficient fuel consumption would only 
slightly change the annual fuel supply costs over the period, while the annualized investments on the 
demand side are estimated to grow significantly due to the introduction of advanced (more energy efficient) 
technologies. The operation and maintenance costs in the Power sector in the WAM scenario are reduced 
(cumulative for around 11%) compared to WEM as a result of the decommissioning of the TPP Bitola. At 
the same time, the annualized investments in the Power sector in WAM scenario are increased for around 
20% compared to WEM, as a result of the increased investments in RES capacities. Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan

For a sustainable transition, besides the economic and environmental, the social aspect is also very 
important. According to the years in which the proposed measures and policies are implemented, for some 
of them, the number of domestic green jobs is calculated at yearly level for the WAM scenario. The highest 
number of around 10,000 green jobs is achieved in 2035 (Figure 46), which represents 2.7 times more 
jobs than the current number of employees in the coal power plants in Republic of North Macedonia (TPP 
Bitola around 2700 and TPP Oslomej around 1000). Retrofitting contributes to the most for the opening of 
new jobs (around 58%), followed by construction of new houses, including passive houses (with around 
19% share). Because of the gradual increase of the standard for renovation and construction of new 
buildings up to 2035, the number of the new green jobs from these measures is increasing in that period. 
Additionally, the measures with the highest share is Retrofitting of existing residential buildings (50% in 
2035), Construction of passive buildings (18% in 2035), RES without incentives, Solar thermal collectors, 
Retrofitting of existing commercial buildings and Solar rooftop (Figure 47). Furthermore, it is shown that 
more than 27% of the new domestic green jobs in 2050 can be assigned to women. Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan

The implementation of the transition measures requires involvement of all stakeholders (Table 4). Most of 
the measures are planned to be implemented by consumers, which makes them the largest investors. This 
primarily refers to households and transport, but also consumers from the commercial, industry and 
agriculture sectors. However, these investments should be largely supported and encouraged by the 
central and local government, which through the implementation of measures intended for them should set 
an example in the implementation of energy efficiency and RES measures. In this regard, funding should 
be provided by an EE fund, donor funding or the funding should be supported by ESCO companies. This 
is especially relevant for the vulnerable consumers which will depend on provision of financial support. 
Private investors (private and state-owned companies) also play an important role in this process of 
transition (mainly for construction of RES capacities), for which it is necessary to create sustainable policies 
and a stable investment climate.

As s e ss m e nts  (E I A)   
The EIA Directive requires Member States to ensure that projects likely to have significant effects on the 
environment because of their nature, size or location are subject to an assessment of their environmental 
effects.  This  assessment  should  take  place  before  development  consent  is  given,  i.e.  before  the 
authority/ies decide(s) that the developer can go ahead with the project. 
The Directive harmonises EIA principles by introducing minimum requirements, in particular for the types 
of projects that should be assessed, the main obligations of developers, the assessment’s content and 
provisions on the participation of competent authorities and the public. 
The Rulebook on the form and the content and the procedure and the manner for elaboration of the 
Environmental Impact assessment (Official Gazette of RNM 33/2006 from 20.03.2006) defines the minimum 
content of the EIA in the national context. The national legal provisions for the elaboration of EIAs do not 
foresee the assessment of the short and long-term climate impact specific projects might have.  
The latest Guidance materials published by the European Commission recommend implementation of the 
climate consideration in the ЕIA procedures and using EIAs as tools to ensure that future plans and projects 
doesn’t significantly increase greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and support better adaption to climate 
change.  
The bullet points below summarise the EC recommendations on how to incorporate climate change into 
EIA: 
•  Consider climate change impacts into the assessment process at an early stage (screening and 
scoping); 
•  Tailor how you incorporate biodiversity and climate change to the specific context of the project: 
•  Bring together all the relevant stakeholders who need to be part of climate change-related decision-
making; 
•  Understand how both climate change interacts with other issues to be assessed in the EIA, as well 
as with each other; 
•  Consider the impact that predicted changes in climate will have on the proposed project, potentially 
over a long timescale, and the project’s resilience and capacity to cope. 
•  Consider long-term trends, with and without the proposed project, and avoid ‘snapshot’ analyses. 
•  Manage complexity. 
•  Consider the complex nature of climate change and the potential of projects to cause cumulative 
effects. 
•  Be comfortable with uncertainty, because you can never be sure of the future. 
•  Base your recommendations on the precautionary principle and acknowledge assumptions and the 
limitations of current knowledge. 
•  Be practical and use your common sense. When consulting stakeholders, avoid drawing out the 
EIA procedure and leave enough time to properly assess complex information. 
•  Consider climate change scenarios at the outset; 
•  Analyse the evolving environmental baseline trends; Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan  
 
•  Take an integrated approach to planning and assessment, investigating relevant thresholds and 
limits. 
•  Seek to avoid climate change effects from the start, before considering mitigation or compensation.  
•  Assess alternatives that make a difference in terms of climate change. 
•  Use ecosystem-based approaches and green infrastructure as part of project design and/or 
mitigation measures. 
•  Assess climate change and biodiversity synergies and cumulative effects, which can be significant. 
The integration of the climate consideration in the EIA procedures should be also supported by amendment 
of the EIA legislation, more specifically amendment of the Rulebook defining the form and the content and 
the procedure and the manner for elaboration of the Environmental Impact assessment. In addition, 
specific training for the staff of the MoEPP is essential to support and evaluate the process of the 
integration of the climate considerations in the EIA.

Directive  2001/42/EC  on  the  assessment  of  the  effects  of  certain  plans  and  programmes  on  the 
environment (‘Strategic Environmental Assessment’ — ‘SEA Directive’) requires certain public plans and 
programmes (PPs) to undergo an environmental assessment before they are adopted. 
The Law on Environment regulates the requirements and the details for elaboration of SEA (Official 
Gazzete 53/05; 81/05; 24/07; 159/08; 83/09; 48/10; 124/10; 51/11; 123/12; 93/13; 187/13; 42/14; 44/2015; 
129/15; 192/15; 39/16 и 99/18), and the national legal provisions for elaboration of EIAs don’t foresee 
extensive assessment of the short and the long term climate impact that the specific strategic planning 
document might have. 
To address the above mentioned, the EC has prepared a Guidance on Integrating Climate Change into 
Strategic Environmental Assessment with aim to improve the consideration of these issues in strategic 
environmental assessments (SEAs) carried out across the EU Member States. 
The bullet points below summarise the EC recommendations on how to address climate change into SEA: 
•  Build them into the assessment and PP from the earliest stage and follow them throughout — start 
at the screening and scoping stages to build these issues into the mindset of all the key parties: 
competent authorities and policymakers, planners, SEA practitioners and other stakeholders. The 
SEA can be used as a creative process to support learning amongst all these parties. 
•  The consideration of climate change issues must be tailored to the specific context of the PP. It is 
not simply a checklist of issues to tick off. Each SEA can potentially be different. 
•  Be practical and use your common sense. When consulting stakeholders, avoid drawing out the 
SEA procedure and leave enough time to properly assess complex information. 
•  Use the SEA as an opportunity to address key issues regarding different types of projects or specific 
infrastructure projects. At this time, many options are still open (e.g. the location of motorways 
versus Natura 2000 network sites) and you can avoid problematic situations at the EIA/project level. 
•  Consider long-term trends both with and without the proposed PP and avoid ‘snapshot’ analyses. 
•  Assess the PP against the future baseline and key trends and their drivers taking into account other 
PPs. 
•  Consider the impact that predicted changes in the climate and biodiversity will have on the 
proposed PP, potentially over a long timescale, and its resilience and capacity to cope. Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan  
 
•  Manage  complexity;  consider  whether  implementation  of  part  of  a  PP  e.g.  climate  change 
mitigation, that might otherwise be positive in its impact, could have a negative impact on climate 
change adaptation. 
•  Consider what existing climate change and biodiversity objectives and targets need to be integrated 
into the PP. 
•  Consider the long-term and cumulative effects on climate change and biodiversity of PP as these 
will be potentially significant given the complex nature of these topics. 
•  Be comfortable with uncertainty. Use tools such as scenarios to help deal with the uncertainty 
inherent within complex systems and imperfect data. Think about risks when impacts are too 
uncertain and factor this into monitoring to manage adverse effects.  
•  Develop more resilient alternatives and solutions based on ‘win-win’ or ‘no regret’/‘low regret’ 
approaches to PP development, given the uncertainty inherent in climate change  
•  Prepare for adaptive management and monitor to improve adaptive capacity. 
•  Base your recommendations on the precautionary principle and acknowledge assumption and 
limitations of current knowledge. 
As in the case with EIA, the extensive assessment of the climate considerations in the SEA procedures 
should be also legally supported by amendment of the SEA legislation, as well as enabled by specific 
training activities for the staff of the MoEPP that should mainstream and evaluate the process of enhanced 
assessment of the climate aspects in the SEA processes.

According to UNFCCC, climate finance refers to local, national or transnational financing—drawn from 
public, private and alternative sources of financing—that seeks to support mitigation and adaptation actions 
that will address climate change.  
As a non-Annex I country to the Convention, Republic of North Macedonia is a recipient of international 
support and is therefore required to report the amount of support received in the subsequent two-year 
period (in the Biennial Update Report to UNFCCC). According to the TBUR, the bilateral support from the 
European Union has the highest contribution to financing climate activities in the last two year period. In 
particular,  the  Instrument  for  Pre-Accession  Assistance  has  development  of  number  of  technical 
assessments, legal and policy instruments, as well enabled many municipalities, NGOs and ministries to 
implement projects, predominantly on climate change mitigation, and thus contribute to the global efforts 
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the adverse effects of climate change. However, the 
TBUR emphasizes that the amount of support received is far from sufficient to meet the needs of 
undertaking other significant mitigation and adaptation activities. 
In the framework of the CBIT Project implemented by UNDP, the country has initiated the process of 
preparation of a MRV tool that will keep track of the progress regarding the national climate targets and 
the implementation of the mitigation and the adaptation policies and measures, and will also record and 
present the climate investments in the country. This tool will significantly improve the transparency of the 
allocation of resources for climate action, and will act as a tool for coordination and prioritisation of climate 
finance. 
It is also important for the government to realize that climate change has already impacted various aspects 
of the economy, and some of them are already being addressed by allocating resources in relevant sectors 
as part of regular annual development plans. Likewise, promoting climate-resilient development and 
reducing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions are national commitments made in the Paris Agreement and 
expressed through the NDCs. The Enhanced NDC of Republic of North Macedonia contains the same set 
of mitigation policies and measures as the Strategy. Since its adoption in April 2021, the country has an Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan  
 
obligation to implement the policies and measures foreseen under the enhanced NDC, as well as to 
continuously report the progress towards the implementation of the policies and measures, as well as the 
climate finance as the main marker for climate action. In the same time, the Draft Law on Climate Action 
foresees the country to start implementation of the reporting requirements foreseen under the MMR in 
2025, which again underlines the need of establishment of an integrated system for transparent and 
overarching MRV of the national climate action. 
However, climate change is a cross-cutting issue and public and private sector activities relevant to climate 
change adaptation and mitigation are often scattered across a number of ministries and governmental 
entities (MoE, MAFAWE, MoF, MTC, LSGUs, etc.). This dispersion makes the process of tracking the 
climate finance difficult, as well the process of tracking the progress towards the national climate targets, 
In  addition,  the  scattered  competences  and  investments  makes  difficulties  to  the  Public  Financial 
Management (PFM) system to facilitate planning, identifying, and reporting on climate change expenditure. 
These challenges can be overcome by introducing Climate Budget Tagging (CBT), which will enable 
mainstreaming climate change in PFM system by identifying, classifying, weighting, and marking climate-
relevant expenditure in the budget system. By marking budget lines, the CBT will enable systematic 
monitoring and tracking climate-related proportion of government expenditures and investments.

The energy sector of Republic of North Macedonia is based on coal run power plants and carbon intensive 
fossil fuels, while in the same time the country is unable to meet their own electricity needs and is strongly 
depended on the imported electricity. The Government is fully aware of the need to boost the quantity and 
quality of its infrastructure and services, in order to improve its ability to compete in the process of joining 
the EU and later on as a member state. A less carbon intensive energy sector will allow for greater 
competitiveness,  economic  growth  and  security  of  supply,  and  is,  at  the  same  time,  an  important 
prerequisite for economic integration within the Western Balkans. 
The energy sector in the country and the economy more broadly, has to deliver on the Green Deal, 
supporting EU initiative in making Europe a climate neutral continent. The European Green Deal (EGD) 
focuses on boosting efficient use of resources and restored biodiversity, i.e.: clean sources of energy, 
circular economy and cut of pollution. The EGD underlines that: “A power sector must be developed that 
is based largely on renewable sources, complemented by the rapid phasing out of coal and decarbonising 
gas. At the same time, the EU's energy supply needs to be secure and affordable for consumers and 
businesses. For this to happen, it is essential to ensure that the European energy market is fully integrated, 
interconnected and digitalised, while respecting technological neutrality.” 
The Western Balkan Green Deal paper underlines the needs of all WB6 countries to follow the rest of the 
countries on the European continent and apply these policies by 2050. As the EU 26, the WB6 countries 
will be part of the Just Transition Mechanism that will provide financial support and technical assistance to 
help those most affected by the move towards a green economy – while also ensuring that the entire 
society will be in a position to access the substantial benefits.  
In the national context, this means closing or modernising the coal fired thermo power plans, investing in 
renewables and environmentally friendly technologies, energy efficiency, reduction of the network losses 
and provision of enabling environment and affordable prices of renewable energy. This is also foreseen 
under the WAM scenario of the Strategy, as well as in the Enhanced NDC and the NECP of RNM. 
The two existing coal-fired power plants in Republic of North Macedonia are both owned and operated by 
JSC “Power Plants of Republic of North Macedonia” (ESM), the national energy utility. The 125MW thermal 
power plant in Oslomej now operates primarily as reserve capacity due to the near total depletion of the 
nearby lignite mine. The 675MW thermal power plant at Bitola provides around 50% of the country’s 
electricity with lignite from two mines – Suvudol and Brod-Gneotino. According to the 2019 Annual Report 
of JSC ESM, the TPP Oslomej and TPP Bitola with their mines employ 3588 employees. A key question Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan  
 
is what will be the impact of any coal closure in these regions – where they will have large impacts on local 
employment and significant socioeconomic impact. Some workers will be able to transfer to new activities 
in ESM linked to new energy sources – be it renewables or linked to gas.  
According to the Just transition mechanism, any transition from coal and the broader opportunities that will 
come should be seen in the context of economies of the geographic regions they are located. The 
Government of RNM has already identified the challenges of the green transition of the energy sector and 
has initiated the process of detailed assessment of the socio-economic implications of the closure of the 
TPPs in the regional and local context, as well as development of a Just transition action plan for the 
Southwest and Pelagonija region. This activity will be funded by EU and is expected to be implemented in 
the period April 2021 – January 2022.

The potential accumulated in the climate action generated and supported by young people in the Republic 
of Republic of North Macedonia is unprecedented. The challenge of building trust and long lasting 
cooperation  between  young  people  and  the  public  administration  is  a  strategic  one.  A  very  good 
demonstration case for youth engagement in climate related decision making processes was the process 
of revising Macedonia’s Nationally Determined Contributions. The input received and the interaction with 
the youth was of essential importance and has provided a fresh and open-minded view of the policy design 
processes. Youth and their engagement in climate action have been fully considered in the design of the 
policies and measures related to education and awareness rising, as well in the foreseen mitigation and 
adaptation policies and measures considered in this Strategy.  
Neither the impacts of climate change on people nor the ways in which people respond to climate change 
are gender-neutral. Gender inequalities and different gender roles, needs and preferences which vary over 
space and over time influence the different ways in which young, adult and elderly males and females 
experience the impacts of climate change and develop strategies to adapt to or mitigate them.  
On the other hand, climate change negative impacts are increasing the already existing gender inequality. 
As a mater of fact, gender inequality increases the vulnerability. In this context, gender inequality should 
be emphasized in social, cultural, social, economic, but also in terms of practicing the services and services 
provided by the state in the area of mitigation and adaptation to climate change. 
Following the Paris Agreement (preamble), as well as the Enhanced Lima Work Programme on Gender 
(LWPG), this Strategy considers the gender perspective as a cross-cutting issue of a crucial importance 
for achieving transparency and effectiveness as well as a sustainability of climate policy and action. 
At national context, under the support and guidance of the Global Support Programme (GSP) as part of 
climate change projects implemented by the Ministry of Environment and Physical Planning and UNDP, 
the Republic of Republic of North Macedonia has taken serious steps towards intersecting gender and 
climate change at policy and administrative level and has been recognized as a positive example and a 
good practice in the region. 
On the other hand, the already highlighted gender inequality in context of climate change sectors is 
confirmed by the gender indicators, with lower (or very low) female participation in decision making 
processes in the climate change related sectors and low employment rate of women in the high GHG 
emitting sectors. Women are also less represented as employees at individual agricultural holdings and 
business entities which reflects their economic dependence and lower capacity to decide on the usage of 
measures related to mitigation/adaptation. In addition, the access to resources is more limited since 
women are dominating the category of unpaid family workers in the agricultural holdings and therefore

An Action Plan on Gender and Climate Change has been prepared under the support and guidance of the 
Global Support Programme (GSP) as part of climate change projects implemented by the Ministry of 
Environment and Physical Planning and UNDP. In that direction, for the first time the topic of gender and 
its intersection with climate change was introduced in the region, by the GSP efforts and its comprehensive 
approach by sharing knowledge, best practices and most effective models of plans development and 
finding best solutions for their effective implementation in the Western Balkan countries. In the period from 
June 2019 to February 2020, within the project "Macedonian Fourth National Communication and Third 
Biennial Update Climate Change Report" the country developed measures and models for systematic 
implementation  of  a  Draft  Action  Plan  on Gender  and  Climate  Change.  The  Action  Plan  foresees 
systematic approach and measures and models for increasing the knowledge and awareness of all 
relevant gender and climate change stakeholders will build institutional capacity for specific actions in this 
area, both at policy and implementation level. These efforts were translated into separate strategic aspects 
on gender and Climate Change within the new Strategy on gender Equality which is currently in process 
of development. 
The Action Plan on Gender and Climate Change recommends implementation of the following actions that 
will increase the knowledge, awareness and climate mainstreaming in the country: 
•  take a stronger lead on gender equality in the climate change arena by promoting gender-inclusive 
policy dialogue and accountability, as well as Platform for Action in national climate change 
planning processes, international climate change negotiations and the emerging climate finance 
architecture;  
•  create enabling organisational environments for effective gender mainstreaming by addressing 
‘mainstreaming fatigue’, institutionalising the application of existing gender commitments to climate 
change  portfolios,  providing  gender  and  climate  change tools  covering  the  entire  project  or 
programme cycle, and addressing institutional disconnects between gender and climate change 
responsibilities;  
•  fill knowledge and best practice gaps in participatory ways that capture men’s, women’s and young 
people’s ideas and knowledge, particularly in areas where the gender dimensions of climate 
change impacts and responses are not immediately obvious, such as transport and infrastructure, 
energy access, housing, and formal or informal employment;  
•  improve the understanding of gendered impacts of climate change and of climate change policy 
and programme impacts by establishing monitoring and evaluation frameworks that disaggregate 
participation in policy and programme design and implementation by gender and age, and measure 
the impacts of climatic variations as well as adaptation and low-carbon development strategies on 
gender relations and inequalities – particularly for strategies at the national and regional levels – 
and for low-carbon development;  
•  promote  gender-responsive  international  climate  negotiations  by  facilitating  multistakeholder 
processes  that  are  inclusive  in  a  horizontal  and  vertical  sense,  promoting  the  inclusion  of 
marginalised voices and making gender a core issue as opposed to a ‘side event’;  
•  address the gender disconnect in project and programme cycles by ensuring that thorough gender 
analyses  of  the  gender  inequalities  and  women  and  men’s,  girls’  and  boys’  different  roles, 
preferences,  needs  and  capacities  underlying  each  context  are  better  entrenched  in 
implementation, monitoring and evaluation;  
•  promote equal access to decision-making processes and new opportunities created by responses 
to climate change by promoting the reduction of legal, infrastructural and other barriers to women’s 
participation in decision-making, markets and particularly processes related to new technologies, 
by making climate change decisions and funding processes transparent and accessible, and by 
training women’s organisations to take part in and lead such processes;  
•  promote gender-responsiveness in emerging funds and policies for adaptation and low-carbon 
development  by  integrating  gender  into  results  frameworks  and  xii  disbursement  processes, Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan  
 
supporting the development of best practice for gender responsiveness in clean technology and 
transport choices and processes, and by bundling and thereby reducing the transaction costs of 
small-scale initiatives that tend to have more gender co-benefits

The  majority  of  the  policies  and  measures  foreseen  under  this  Strategy  are  foreseen  to  be 
implemented by the general public and the private sector, so it will be essential to ensure a stable and 
competitive regulatory framework, that guarantees the involvement and commitment of the main 
actors, public and private, with implementation of the measures necessary to achieve the defined 
objectives, thus providing stability for investors in the most diverse sectors. 
In addition, the Government should encourage the grater citizen involvement in the climate change 
decision making processes though awareness raising campaigns, dialogue platforms and debates, as well 
as provision of funding for citizen engagement in the climate action. The civil society organisations should 
facilitate this process and act as a mediator between the government and the public sector.  
The inclusive approach to climate action seeks to overcome the lack of community engagement, while 
simultaneously changing the mind-set of the general public and raising the awareness about the 
importance of the climate action. Engaging a variety of stakeholders within the country provides an 
accurate representation of existing vulnerabilities that future policies should address. By involving 
groups that have been previously inactive and not introduced with the national climate policies, the 
climate authorities will find out more about the needs on the ground and the needs for adjustment of 
specific policies or measures, or the needs for creation of additional policy packages that should 
support specific needs and problems of the population. The same can be said for development 
planning and its impact on disaster risk reduction. Communities vulnerable to disasters often suffer 
from both poor planning and limited response, therefore it is important that these communities are 
involved in policymaking so that they can address long-term risks in a proactive way rather than 
address short-term risks in a reactive way.

The implementation of the policies and measures foreseen under this Strategy require comprehensive 
policy planning, coordination and implementation processes. This must be enabled by a comprehensive 
legal basis and legally established coordination instruments to facilitate cross-sectoral policy design and 
implementation, as well as mechanisms for monitoring the implementation of the foreseen policies and 
measures. The draft Law on Climate action provides an enabling environment for overarching policy 
coordination  processes,  and  defines  the  legal  mechanism  for  monitoring  progress  towards  the 
achievement of the national sustainable development pathway. The draft Law on Climate Action, its 
supporting  secondary  legislation,  and  the  Strategy  should  be  perceived  as  a  package  of  enabling 
instruments for climate action in Republic of North Macedonia. 
The draft Law on Climate Action, which was developed by the Project, defines the MoEPP as the leading 
institution to coordinate climate related activities as well as to establish the National inventory system and 
the System for reporting on policies, measures and projections of Republic of North Macedonia. Besides, 
the Law outlines the institutions in Republic of North Macedonia, which must submit activity and other data 
to the MoEPP. These institutions collect and hold relevant activity and other data, which is necessary for 
the determination of inventories and for the preparation of reports. 
A coherent monitoring and evaluating system, as defined in the draft Law, should be established in order 
to ensure an efficient and effective achievement of the Strategy goals.  
The overall coordination of activities in relation to the Strategy is under the responsibility of the MoEPP. 
The draft Law foresees the establishment of an intergovernmental body – National Climate Change 
Council, which will assess the progress in the implementation of national strategies and plans related to 
climate change. 
Monitoring climate action is closely related to the implementation of the MMR Directive. The draft Decree 
on National Inventory System developed by the Project contains an EU guided template for monitoring and 
reporting the implementation of the policies and measures. The template can be further upgraded in a 
digital solution for user friendly monitoring and reporting of national progress towards the implementation 
of the Strategy. 
Finally, an ex-post evaluation should focus on the overall assessment of the relevance, efficiency, 
effectiveness, impact and sustainability of inter-sectoral Strategy interventions, on the analysis of factors 
influencing the effectiveness and impact of the Strategy, and on lessons learned. The results of the ex-
post evaluation will be used for planning and reviewing of future climate strategies and other climate policy 
documents.

a c ti on 
In the last few years, climate aspects have gained attention among national policy makers and a number 
of policy documents have been streamlined, developed and adopted.  
The most updated and relevant climate action documents are as follows: 
-  The Vulnerability and Adaptation Assessments developed in the framework of the Third National 
Communication (2013). The Vulnerability Assessment which was done in the framework of the TNC 
has identified the following sectors as extremely vulnerable to the climate change: Cultural Heritage, 
Health, Biodiversity, Tourism, Water Resources, Agriculture, Forestry and DRR; 
-  The Strategy for Energy Development of the Republic of Republic of North Macedonia until 2040 
(adopted in December 2019); 
-  The Climate Change Mitigation Assessment prepared in the framework of the TBUR (2020); 
-  The National Energy and Climate Plan (finalised in July 2020); 
-  The Forth National Energy Efficiency Plan (under preparation). 
The  Long-term  Strategy  on  Climate  Action  is  fully  coherent  and  aligned  with  all  national  planning 
documents related to climate action. Furthermore, the modelling work done in the framework of the 
development of the scenarios for the Strategy has been based and has extended the WEM and the eWAM 
scenarios which have been used for the development of the Energy Strategy up to 2040, the National 
Energy and Climate Plan and the Climate Change Mitigation Assessment under the TBUR.  APPENDIX A:

Activity 6 “Development of the draft Action Plan on Climate Change” focuses on (1) the 
identification of actions to be carried in a first phase of implementation of the Long-term 
Strategy on Climate Action (Strategy), which was developed under Activity 3; (2) drafting the 
Action Plan for the 1st Stage of Implementation of the Strategy and Law on Climate Action 
(Action Plan); and (3) the elaboration of concept notes for proposals to attract international 
climate finance for the implementation of specific actions identified in the Action Plan. 
Following the Terms of Reference of the Project, this Action Plan contains specific climate 
actions identified in the Strategy and Law on Climate Action (Law or LCA), and prescribes 
responsible institutions, time frames, and an estimation of the resources necessary for their 
implementation. The Action Plan does so in a step-by-step approach, dividing each action in 
sub-activities that contribute to the achievement of the main action. The Action Plan also 
provides a framework to monitor and evaluate its implementation. 
While there are similarities between this Action Plan and the action plan to implement the 
Strategy described in the Law, it is important to differentiate the two instruments. 
This Action Plan is broader in scope than that regulated in the Law, as it contains actions to 
implement the Law itself. 
The action plan regulated in the Law finds its legal basis in Article 16 of the Law and should 
not contain actions necessary to implement the Law. In fact, the adoption of the Law is a 
prerequisite for its development. 
The actions contained in this Action Plan are segregated as follows: 
•  Actions that support the implementation of the mitigation objectives of the Strategy (A-
M); 
•  Actions that support the implementation of the adaptation objectives of the Strategy 
(A-A); 
•  Actions that support the cross-sectoral coordination objectives of the Strategy (A-C); 
and 
•  Actions that support the implementation of the legal framework for climate action and 
the strengthening of institutional capacity (A-L). 
In  consultation  with  the  main  Beneficiary  of  the  Project,  the  “first  stage”  or  phase  of 
implementation of the Strategy and Law have been defined as the period 2021-2030. 
1 . 2  V i s i on a nd  c l im a te   obj ec ti ve s   of  the   c ountr y  
Considering the current situation regarding climate change in the Republic of Republic of North 
Macedonia (Republic of North Macedonia), the results of the modelling of the greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions, including the respective social, economic and environmental impacts as 
described in the following chapters, and taking into consideration the Paris Agreement, the 
European Union’s 2030 Climate and Energy Framework, the European strategic long-term 
vision for a prosperous, modern, competitive and climate neutral economy, the vision of the 
Strategy is as follows: 
Republic of North Macedonia is, by 2050, a prosperous, low carbon 
economy, following sustainable and climate resilient development Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan  
 
pathways, enhancing competitiveness and promoting social 
cohesion through action to combat climate change and its impacts. 
This vision of the Strategy is based on the recognition that, in the framework of the Paris 
Agreement, all countries will deliver their fair and ambitious contribution towards the global 
temperature goals inscribed in that agreement, which requires peaking of the global GHG 
emissions as soon as possible, and achieving a balance between global emissions and global 
sinks in the second half of the century. The vision enshrines Republic of North Macedonia’s 
sustainable development approach to fighting the causes and the impacts of climate change, 
in which a fairer and more equal society will be built, considering gender equality and female 
empowerment; the economy will successfully compete with other economies under the same 
conditions; and the environment will be protected for the benefit of future generations. 
Based on modelling results, the results of the Strategic Environmental Impact Assessment, 
the foreseen socio-economic benefits and the need to adapt to changed climatic conditions, 
the general objective of the Strategy is: 
Reduction of national net GHG emissions (including Forestry and Other Land Use and 
excluding MEMO items) of 72% by 2050 compared to 1990 levels (or GHG emission 
reduction of 42% by 2050 compared to 1990, excluding FOLU and MEMO items) and 
increased  resilience  of  Republic  of  North  Macedonia’s  society,  economy  and 
ecosystems to the impacts of climate change. 
MEMO items include emissions from aviation and electricity import. 
To support compliance with the general objective and with the implementation of sectoral 
measures, the general objective of the Strategy is disaggregated into specific mitigation, 
adaptation,  and  crosscutting  objectives,  where  specific  mitigation  objectives  reflect  the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) sectoral aggregation of GHG emissions 
and, therefore, to the extent possible, also correspond to the division of responsibilities for the 
achievement of specific objectives. 
Specific objective 1: To reduce GHG emissions by 64% in the Energy sector (excluding MEMO 
items) by 2050 compared to 1990.  
The energy industries sector will deliver the greatest emissions reductions, namely through 
the implementation of the polluter pays principle (carbon taxation) and through the increased 
penetration of renewable energy sources (RES) in the energy mix. This will require an 
important transformation of the sector, given the current important reliance on the carbon 
intensive national lignite as a source of energy. The internalization of the cost of carbon dioxide 
(CO2) in the price paid by the final consumer will provide an incentive for market participants 
to move to zero or lower emitting fuels (RES, natural gas); to adopting processes (in the 
industrial sector) which are less energy intensive and producing higher added value products; 
and/or  promoting  energy  efficiency  to  reduce  demand  for  electricity.  The  technological 
advancement  of  the  RES  technologies,  especially  the  ones  related  to  wind  and  solar 
generation, has substantially reduced the relevant installation and operation costs, making 
wind and solar capacity able to offer competitive prices in the wholesale electricity markets. 
Market prices, nevertheless, assuming the internalization of the carbon prices in the bids of 
thermal power plants, are at adequate level and allow the cost recovery for wind and solar 
investments, reducing the need for subsidies and financial support. 
Furthermore, on the side of consumption of energy, energy efficiency is at the core of the 
climate and energy policies and is fundamental to a competitive economy and a secure and 
resilient energy system. Attributing priority to energy efficiency is the only way to avoid wasting 
the costly energy produced and delivered to the final consumer. Investments in energy 
efficiency  provide  important  cost-savings  to  businesses  and  households  (in  addition  to 
enhanced thermal comfort, particularly in the residential sector), thus constituting an important 
incentive to participate in the efforts towards a carbon constrained economy. In addition to Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan  
 
reductions achieved in households and tertiary sector, reduction of GHG emissions in the 
transport sector is to be achieved mostly through an increase of energy efficiency and through 
the renewal of the fleet. In this context, the introduction of hybrid and electric vehicles will play 
an important role, but, in the short term, not as important as the reduction of fuel consumption 
in traditional combustion vehicles, which will, by 2030, remain as the typical vehicle in Republic 
of North Macedonia. 
Specific objective 2: To increase GHG emissions by not more than 153% in the IPPU sector 
by 2050 compared to 1990.  
Specific objective 3: To reduce GHG emissions by 34% in the Agriculture sector by 2050 
compared to 1990 
Agriculture will contribute to GHG emissions reductions through the adoption of measures that 
contribute to sustainable agriculture, through increased carbon sequestration in the soil 
(because of increased organic matter in the soil), and increased efficiency in milk production 
and reduced fertilizer input through enhanced agriculture practices and implementation of new 
technologies. 
Specific objective 4: To increase carbon sinks by 1733% in the Forest and Other Land Use 
sector by 2050 compared to 1990. 
The Republic of North Macedonian forest has an important role to play in the transition to a 
low carbon economy, as it can provide a carbon neutral energy source and a great potential 
to  increase  the  net  carbon  sink  of  the  country.  Afforestation  and  sustainable  forest 
management will transform the forest sector in the country, providing great opportunities for 
job creation and to enhance resilience to climate change impacts. 
Specific objective 5: To reduce GHG emissions by 2% in the Waste sector by 2050 compared 
to 1990. 
Reduction of GHG emissions in the waste sector will take place through the implementation 
of the measures contained in the current waste policy framework which is already to some 
extend aligned with the EU acquis. Nonetheless, based on the assessment of the current 
situation, the implementation of the current existing measures is lagging behind and requires 
an important effort up to 2030 and beyond. 
Specific objective 6: To build solid systems for the regular and periodic collection data for the 
production and dissemination of scientific and technical knowledge. 
Data collection system proves to be crucial for the appropriate and timely response to the 
effects of climate change. This is in particularly important in the field of water resource and the 
use of water for irrigation. Furthermore, adapting to climate change in agriculture requires the 
vertical integration of scientific knowledge creation and dissemination. In addition, climate 
change may have significant impacts on biodiversity which requires development of a national 
research plan for biodiversity and an indicator system to monitor the impacts of climate change 
on biodiversity. Above all, accurate real-time air-climate-health data is important for the whole 
society and significant improvement of the processes for collection and dissemination of such 
data is crucial for the adaptive capacity of the sector human health. 
Specific objective 7: To increase the resilience of climate change impacts of key socio-
economic sectors and ecosystems. 
The preparation and adoption of the National Adaptation Plan is an important step for Republic 
of North Macedonia to identify adaptation needs and to develop and implement policies and 
measures and actions to address those needs; and enable actions to protect vulnerable 
communities. 
Specific objective 8: To establish comprehensive policy planning, coordination and policy 
implementation instruments for climate action. Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan  
 
This must be enabled by a comprehensive legal basis and legally established coordination 
instruments for the facilitation of cross sectoral policy design and implementation, as well as 
mechanisms for monitoring the implementation of the foreseen policies and measures.  
Specific objective 9: Mainstream climate change related aspects into the future national 
strategic planning documents related to education, research, and development, innovation, 
social inclusion and equal opportunities on women and men. 
The most important national strategic documents that should integrate climate related aspects 
are the future National Strategy for Education and the National Innovation Strategy. This will 
assure the systematic and harmonised integration of the climate related aspects in the national 
educational, research and development, innovation ecosystem, as well as increase the 
educational and research capacities and the climate awareness of the public. At the same 
time, intersecting climate change and gender will ensure effectiveness of the climate resilience 
policies and measures. 
Specific objective 10: To promote the green transition through capacity building, training for 
new skills and awareness rising. 
The transition to a low carbon economy is based on technological innovation, on large scale 
investment and policy decisions, but is also based on decision and behaviours of the individual 
citizen. Well informed and aware citizens, of all ages, are more likely to actively engage in the 
effort to reduce GHG emissions. Additionally, reducing GHG emissions require new technical 
skills which can be acquired via education via the school system, but also, via adult training, 
thus facilitating the transfer of workers from sectors with job losses to sectors with job gains. 
Overall climate change framework needs to be managed and supervised by competent 
authorities where significantly enhanced capacity is needed as a pre-condition for sustainable 
implementation, monitoring and reporting of mitigation policies and measures. 
1 . 3  Rol e   of  the   Law   on  Cl i m a te  Ac ti on  a nd 
s e c onda ry   le gi s l a ti on  dev e lope d  by   the  
P r oj e c t 
The LCA provides the legal basis for the development and implementation of actions needed 
to achieve the climate long-term vision and objectives of Republic of North Macedonia. The 
Strategy, one of the basic planning documents for climate action in the country, reflects these 
vision and objectives. The implementation of the Law and Strategy is central to achieving the 
climate goals of Republic of North Macedonia. 
The LCA is conceived as a general law establishing the legal framework for climate action 
without regulating all details of climate action in all climate-relevant sectors. The LCA will need 
implementation through secondary legislation and through sectoral legislation and related by-
laws. Climate action is cross-sectoral and, thus, builds upon climate-specific and sectoral 
legislation at the same time. Sectoral legislation is not replaced but rather contributes for its 
respective area to climate action. The LCA reflect this concept in its objectives which are 
(according to Article 4 of the current draft): 
1)  To contribute to the mitigation of climate change and to the adaptation to its 
adverse effects; 
2)  To  establish  the  policy,  planning  and  administrative  framework  necessary  to 
mitigate and adapt to climate change in a cost-effective manner; 
3)  To provide for the rules to ensure that mitigation of climate change and adaptation 
to its adverse effects are taken into account and are complied with in sectoral 
policies, plans and administrative practices; Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan  
 
4)  To reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to contribute to the achievement of 
reductions that are considered scientifically necessary to avoid the adverse effects 
of climate change; 
5)  To establish the framework for policies, planning and administrative measures 
necessary  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  from  sources  to  the  level 
considered scientifically necessary and maintain and enhance removals by sinks, 
taking  into  account  the  commitments  and  obligations  under  the  international 
agreements in the field of climate change, ratified by the Republic of Republic of 
North Macedonia; and 
6)  To  establish  the  monitoring  and  reporting  mechanisms  necessary  for  timely, 
transparent,  accurate,  consistent,  comparable,  and  complete  reporting  and 
verification of information on specified anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions 
by sources and removals by sinks, and on climate change adaptation actions.  
As can be seen from the objectives of the LCA, the core of the framework legislation are the 
rules on the nature of climate action as a state obligation, the definitions that govern the 
understanding of the complex task of climate action, institutional arrangements to coordinate 
and mainstream climate action, the rules on the basic planning instruments, which must direct 
and  provide  an  orientation  for  climate  action  long-term,  mechanisms  to  regulate  GHG 
emissions  from  industry  and  aviation,  and—of  central  importance—the  rules  on  the 
establishment of a monitoring and reporting system for GHG. Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan

Livestock Units 
Description: By modification of the manure management in dairy cows, the emission of N2O can be reduced up to 30%. 
In discussion with farmers, the most common system is dry manure management, where manure together with bedding 
(mostly wheat or barley straw) are taken out of the barn daily or within week. The manure than is composting on pile near 
the farm. Farmers do not use any cover of manure nor tanks for collecting liquid drainage of the pile. Fermentation is 
usually mixed where in bottom parts is anaerobic, but on the surface, due to aeration it is aerobic. Manure is used as 
fertilizer mostly within 2-3 months (depending on storage capacity on the farm and field availability). Depending on 
manure fermentation the loss of N can be up to 60%. The N loss and reduction of the N2O emissions can be reached by 
prolonging fermentation period up to 6 months and covering the pile. Hence the measure is to support farmers with less 
than 50 cows to provide proper manure storage places for longer period

comments:  
•  On farm modified manure management for farms with 10 to 50 cows 
•  Dairy cow produce manure about 7% of the life weight per day. Milking cows are 
weighted between 500 and 650 kg, depending on breed and conditions. Heifers 1-
2 year, calves 3-12 months and young calves 0-3 months are transformed into 
adult cow by coefficient 2, 4 and 10, respectively. For simplicity, animal units (AU) 
should be used as a base (1 AU = 500 kg). Based on usual feed consumption, 
bedding material (annual average use of 8% wheat/barley straw) it can be 
expected about 0.04 m3 manure per AU/day 
•  The manure has about 40% moisture and during the storage reduce volume for 
40%. For the period of 6 months total volume of 5 m3 per AU should be expected. 
For pile composting, a trench with clay or concreate floor with inclination of 4% is 
required. The pile needs to be protected from rainfall (either by roof or covered by 
plastic foil. Aeration is occurring when fresh manure is adding, taking care that old 
and already fermented one should be always on top. By prolonging manure 
storage and covering period the reduction of N2O emission will be for 30% is 
expected

Description: Cultivation of land on inclined terrain causes intensive processes of soil erosion and mineralization of sol 
organic matter. These processes lead to intensive decomposition of soil organic matter and emission of soil carbon into 
atmosphere. Conversion of such areas into perennial grassland (pastures, meadows) will significantly decrease intensity 
of soil organic matter depletion and emission of soil carbon and will lead to carbon sink. Areas above 15% inclination by 
law should not be cultivated and are not considered as agricultural land. This conversion supposes land use change and 
change of the production system, which might influence the net annual income of primary producers. Due to this, its Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan  
 
implementation should be supported with incentives, especially in the first years of conversion, in order to bridge possible 
loss of incomes in farm holds

comments:   of SOM as a result of its intensive decomposition and intensive soil erosion 
processes. If conversion to grass land is implemented, the estimated SOM 
increase is for more than 2% which for the total converted area of 2975 ha.  
•  The conversion of land use, should:  
o  Stop the intensive process of erosion of the top soil layer which leads to 
loss of soil organic matter and its intensive ex-city mineralization, 
o  Stop on site mineralization of soil organic matter due to intensive 
processes of cultivation, 
o  Intensify carbon sink through accumulation of soil organic matter. 
 
A-M-40: Contour cultivation on areas under field crops on inclined terrains (5-15%) 
Main objective: To reduce erosion of topsoil and conservation of soil organic matter 
Description: Regular cultivation in crop production means a massive disturbance of topsoil layer, which cause intensive 
mineralization of soil organic matter (SOM) and CO2 emissions. Downslope cultivation of cropland usually causes Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan  
 
intensive processes of soil erosion. Field experiments showed that the quantity of eroded sediment is multiply higher if 
compared to contour cultivation. This eroded sediment is reach with SOM which in such circumstances is rapidly 
mineralized, due to what significant quantity of soil carbon is released into atmosphere.  
Contour cultivation means that all agro-technical operations should be across the slope. This measure is easy to be 
implemented, since it does not require a special technical capacities and know-how. In practice, farmers usually are not 
aware of its importance and influence of the overall soil fertility. With a systematic campaign for increasing the awareness 
of the farmers this measure can be widely adopted.

Description: In vineyards and orchard on locations where rows are oriented downslope, as a result of intensive classical 
system of cultivation, an intensive processes of soil erosion and depletion of SOM occurs, which lead to intensive

A-M-42: Use of biochar for carbon sink on agricultural land 
Main objective: Carbon sink by negative emission technology Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan  
 
Description: The agricultural soils in the country are characterized as soils with relatively low carbon content and with 
average to low fertility. The application of biochar can improve soil water holding capacity, nutrients storage into the soil, 
and increase yield. Biochar can capture even 3 times more CO2 compared to its weight, because of its high carbon 
concentration. Biochar was included for the first time as a promising negative emission technology in the new IPCC 
special report “An IPCC Special Report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and related 
global greenhouse gas emission pathways, in the context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate 
change, sustainable development, and efforts to eradicate poverty” published in 2018. The process of application of 
biochar should go through several steps: i) research, ii) development the suitable technology for various soil/crop 
combination iii) experimental/demonstrative sites iv) development the measure for support from national programs for 
support of agriculture v) promotion of measure. This is new measure, need some research, therefore, in period 2017 –

A-M-53: Develop natural gas cross-border infrastructure to diversify supply routes and increase market 
competitiveness 
Main objective: Develop natural gas cross-border infrastructure to diversify supply routes and increase market 
competitiveness 
Description: On 10 July 2015 the Republic of North Macedonia became a signatory to the Memorandum of 
understanding on a common approach to address the natural gas diversification and the challenges of security of supply 
within the Central and Southeastern Europe Gas Connectivity Initiative (CESEC). 
NER JSC Skopje has started implementing the obligations under this Initiative aimed at promoting the diversification of 
natural gas supply and ensuring security in the supply of the region, which should take place by improving the regional 
infrastructure and integration of markets through the joint engagement of all EU Member States and Contracting Parties 
of the Energy Community. This initiative should provide the supply of the necessary quantities of natural gas to all 
consumers in the region of Central and South-Eastern Europe (CESEC), including the Republic of North Macedonia. 
In addition, there are two other initiatives - pipelines to Kosovo* and Serbia. The pipeline to Serbia could provide 
additional alternative source and transit opportunity to the Macedonian system, while the connection with Kosovo* could 
provide transit opportunity. Both can increase the utilization rate of the system, thus have the potential to decrease tariffs 
and help the gasification efforts in RN Macedonia. The projects for gas pipelines to Kosovo* and Serbia are on the 
preliminary PECI 2020 list that should be adopted by the Ministerial council at the end on 2020, while the gas project to 
Greece is already included on the PMI list, verified on 14 October 2016 by the Ministerial council of the Energy 
Community. 
Furthermore, Macedonia and Albania have signed a Memorandum of understanding and a working group is established 
and it is expected that by the end of 2020 more concrete activities will start.

Description: It is anticipated that day ahead market coupling, and development of power exchange is playing an 
important role in the future for RN Macedonia and EnC market integration initiatives (WB6). Future potential domestic 
capacities for electricity generation are considered in the context of integrated regional and European market. In addition, 
a well-integrated regional market will serve as a control indicator for price competitiveness and steer future capital 
investment decisions.  
In order to have competitive natural gas market in RN Macedonia, the interconnection agreement between Macedonian 
and Bulgarian TSOs is of crucial importance

A-M-57: Develop further distribution system network to integrate more RES, including prosumers and more 
electric vehicles (EVs), as well as continuously improve network reliability 
Main objective: Develop further distribution system network to integrate more RES, as well as continuously improve 
network reliability 
Description: The RES policies and measures envisage a huge number of solar PVs up to 1,400 MW, out of which 250 – 
400 MW being rooftop PVs. Such trend indicates an important role of the distribution network system to service growing 
decentralised systems. In addition, European practice shows that regulators are imposing additional pressure and 
incentive to improve the operational performance and results of distribution system operators. The key changes that 
should be considered in the future are related in introducing new quality indicators in the tariff methodology (voltage 
quality, quality of supply, customer relationship quality etc.), as well as additional revisions on investment decisions 
(CAPEX and regulated asset base), operating efficiency and expected returns for distribution system operators. These 
changes in the regulatory framework will indirectly contribute to improvements in asset management, workforce 
management, automation and roll out of “behind the meter” services in the future

A-M-58: Price signal demand response 
Main objective: Introduce price signals to consumers in order to implement demand response 
Description: Demand response is one of the main methods that are used in order to reduce the maximum electricity 
consumption in the system, and thus reduce its peak load and integrate higher level of RES in the system. Price 
signalling provided by the electricity suppliers can significantly contribute towards achieving these goals. By implementing 
the new Energy Law, and by the liberalized market it is envisioned that the role of the universal supplier will be reduced, 
and that the concurrency of the suppliers will be increased. Therefore, each of them may introduce different pricing 
signals for different type of consumers

Communication: 
•  Inaccurate statistical data for some statistical units, particularly at the settlement level, because the Census of 
Population, Households and Dwellings was not conducted in 2011 
•  Certain data in the field of health, social care, employment, etc., are not available at the municipal level due to the 
method of processing and disclosure of relevant institutions. The above information is processed and disseminated 
at the level of 30 centres. The official statistical data on incomes and expenditures of households, poverty, socially 
excluded groups and related indicators are available only as totals for the Republic of North Macedonia as a whole 
and are not disaggregated 
•  Comparability of data over time is not possible due to changes in applied methodology and changes in the 
administrative divisions in which the census data are published 
•  Limiting factors meant that the composite socio-economic index could not include indicators on the economic 
situation of the population, such as the unemployment rate and the level of household income

The actions to implement the Law differentiate between those actions which directly flow from 
the LCA and partly require implementation immediately after its adoption (below, section 2.4.1, 
referring to the Road Map for the Implementation of the Law developed by the Project) and 
those  actions  which  can  be  classified  as  medium-term  and  longer-term,  following  the 
immediate actions. The latter actions (below, section 2.4.2 and 2.4.3), still within the first phase 
of implementation, relate to organisational arrangements and capacity-strengthening and are 
based on the Action Plan for Administrative Strengthening which has been prepared by the 
Project. 
A particular set of actions will be needed to update the legal framework of the country in the 
light of new EU legislation in the coming years, and these must be reflected in this Action Plan 
as well (below, section 2.4.2.2). Currently, EU legislation concerning climate action is under 
deep revision, within the context of the EU Green Deal launched in December 2019 which led 
to the proposal of an EU “climate law” in March 2020, the stepping up of the EU GHG reduction 
target for 2030, and the proclaimed intention to review and revise relevant EU legislation in 
the sectors in the years to come. All areas of EU climate legislation will be affected, and the 
legislation of RN Macedonia may require adjustments and amendments in the LCA, sectoral 
legislation,  and  by-laws.  These  developments  must  be  followed  for  eventual  needs  of 
updating. Updates will further be required with the progress of the accession process and the 
eventual membership of RN Macedonia in the EU. Certain obligations—also in the area of 
climate action—are linked to membership, and legislative amendments may be required to be 
in line with the accession agreement (below, section 2.4.2.1).

The project has prepared a Road Map for the implementation of the Law to which reference 
is made here for full details. The main features of the Road Map are: 
The Road Map lists the actions which are needed immediately after the adoption and the entry 
into force of the Law. The actions cover, first of all, the preparation and adoption of secondary 
legislation foreseen in the LCA as well as institutional and administrative arrangements. The 
actions are classified according to the chapters of the LCA: general provisions, planning for 
climate action, climate action mechanism, system of monitoring and reporting, inspection and 
misdemeanours, and transitional and final provisions. 
The Road Map also indicates the responsibility for taking the actions, and in most cases the 
responsibility for preparing the secondary legislation needed is with the MoEPP as the main 
authority in the area of climate action. The secondary legislation comprises both, decrees to 
be enacted by the Government, and Rulebooks to be enacted by the Ministry, in some cases 
in cooperation with other Ministries, as clearly provided for in the LCA.  
The institutional and administrative actions consist in creating the necessary organizational 
structures in the authorities to create the institutional basis to implement the LCA and to 
provide the necessary human and technical resources. 
The Road Map also proposes a scheduling of the actions. It recognizes that it depends on and 
the date of the adoption of the LCA. However, as a general rule, the actions should be taken 
in the first two years after the adoption of the Law.

2. 4. 2  A cti ons f or  f urt her   devel opment   of  t he l egal  
f r am ew or k  f or  cl im at e  acti on 
Current  legal  developments  with  regard  to  climate  action  both,  at  the  European  and 
international levels, as well as the progress of accession of RN Macedonia towards accession 
to the EU will necessitate the adjustment of the legal framework established with the Law. 
Therefore, the LCA must be understood as initiating a legislative process to build up the full 
and continuously adjusted legal framework.  
Three factors will determine the needs of continuous legislative adjustments in the coming 
decade:  
- membership of the Republic of North Macedonia in the EU;  
-  new  EU  legislation  on  climate  action  leading  to  new  requirements  in  the  EU  Acquis 
Communautaire; and  
- evaluation of experiences under the currently established legal framework.  
2.4.2.1  Adjustments for the date of EU accession 
The LCA provides the legal framework for climate action as it can be laid down at the moment 
when RN Macedonia is a candidate country for EU accession. The LCA can prepare for 
complying with the obligations of a member state of the EU; it cannot anticipate the obligations 
of the country as a member state and require application before the date of accession. The 
actions needed at the time of accession will depend on the outcome of the accession 
negotiations between RN Macedonia and the agreement reached in the accession treaty.  
The main adjustments will be needed for the full compliance with the mechanisms to reduce 
GHG from industry and aviation, i.e., for the full participation in the EU Emission Trading 
System (ETS). The LCA currently foresees actions to prepare for participation through the 
requirements of GHG emission permits – for industrial installations - and monitoring and 
reporting obligations according to an approved monitoring plan which applies to both, industry 
activities and aviation. This will help identify the GHG emissions in the country from these 
sectors. What the law does not yet establish is the regime for allocating the allowances for 
GHG emissions and the participation in the trade of allowances at the EU level. These rules 
must be established in a process which ensures that they are in place and operational at the 
date of accession. 
The legislative actions will include amendments to the LCA to introduce the legal required 
legal obligations, specified in additional pieces of secondary legislation for which enabling 
provisions will be needed. Main responsibility will be with the MoEPP to drive this process, 
with  additional  institutional  capacity  and  resources.  Close  cooperation,  information  and 
consultation with stakeholders will be necessary. 
186 
 Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan  
 
The timing of the actions will depend on the date of accession; as soon as the date is fixed 
preparation for the actions can start. For the contents of the legislative actions, the treaty of 
accession will need to be taken into account, especially for possible transition period rules. 
Further development of the legal framework will also be needed in the sectors not covered by 
the ETS; these are the sectors under the Effort-sharing regime, particularly: energy use in 
buildings, transport, agriculture, wastes, and F-Gases. With accession – and as the EU 
legislation stands at the moment – RN Macedonia will be required to comply with targets for 
the sectors covered which will be prescribed in the accession treaty. The regime, however, 
will come under review and revision in the near future, and any further development of the 
national legislation will have to take the developments into account.  
While the MoEPP will again have an overall and coordinating role, the relevant sectoral 
authorities will be implied. The preparation of the actions which are needed will be done in 
cooperation. It may be necessary to add basic rules to the LCA; this will be decided if 
appropriate. However, amendments to sectoral legislation, including its secondary legislation, 
can be expected to fully comply with the EU effort-sharing regime as it will be at the time of 
accession.  There  may  be  implications  for  the  administrative  capacity  of  the  sectoral 
institutions, too. Concerning the possible timing, the same what has been said about the ETS 
above, applies here too.

2.4.2.2  Adjustments to transpose new EU legislation in climate action 
EU legislation is currently under fundamental review which will lead to changes in the EU 
Acquis. RN Macedonia as a candidate country preparing for EU accession will need to 
consider these developments for transposition and implementation. The EU “Green Deal” 
launched in December 2019 covers also climate action and has already led to milestones the 
EU process for new legislation, most prominently to the presentation of a proposed Regulation 
to establish an EU “climate law” in March 2020, and, as part of it, a proposal for a new GHG 
reduction target for 2030. The process is currently ongoing as negotiations are being held 
between the EU institutions to reach final agreement on the elements of the legislative 
package. However, it is clear that there will be changes in EU legislation, and these changes 
will affect all areas of climate action and all relevant sectors. Eventually, changes in the 
national framework will be needed. The country will have to follow closely the process and, 
where necessary, will have to initiate legislative amendments at various levels. Possible 
actions are reflected in the table below. 
The main responsibility to follow the legal developments at EU level will be with the MoEPP 
and its climate action unit and staff. New legislative developments at the EU level may 
necessitate amendments of the legal framework in RN Macedonia, even before the date of 
accession. Certain EU requirements may relate to the existing framework and may need 
transposition to adjust the legal rules. The adjustments may relate to all parts of the legal 
framework, i.e., the LCA, its secondary legislation and the relevant sectoral legislation. The 
timing will depend on the legislative processes at the EU level and the precise frameworks 
agreed in the possible new community acts.

2.4.2.3  Adjustments to respond to experience under the legal framework 
Adjustments due to new planning and institutional developments 
Climate action as a cross-cutting task requires the interaction of environmental and sectoral 
policies, planning and legislation; to succeed, climate action essentially needs coordination 
and cooperation of all areas. Policies, planning and legislation in the sectors change over time 
making coordination and cooperation a continuous undertaking. New arrangements and 
achievements in both, the environmental and the sectoral areas, may have legal implications 
and may necessitate adjustments of the current legal framework for climate action. 
A major pillar of climate action is planning. The LCA provides for the preparation of a Long-
term Strategy on Climate Action following the requirements of the EU Regulation 2018/1999 
on climate and energy governance which prescribes the contents of climate actions. The 
requirements for the Strategy also cover climate action in the areas for which efforts are 
shared between the member states as well as action for adaptation to the negative impacts of 
climate  change.  The  Strategy  must  be  implemented  through  a  shorter-term  planning 
instrument. In the concept of the EU Regulation 2018/1999, this is the National Energy and 
Climate Plan (NECP). 
In RN Macedonia, the LCA had to take note of the NECP being prepared and being in the 
process of adoption, based on the relevant legislation and prepared by the institutions 
competent for energy and climate; the outcome had to be awaited. The current LCA reflects 
190 
 Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan  
 
this situation in a way that it recognizes energy and climate action planning, and requires – 
following the EU Regulation 2018/1999 – that the NECP shall be consistent with the long-term 
Strategy. However, in order to make sure that the Long-term Strategy is being implemented 
in its entirety and in all the areas covered, the LCA provides for a separate planning instrument, 
namely an Action Plan, and makes detailed prescriptions for its functions and contents. In this 
way, the current LCA is to ensure that adequate implementation of the long-term strategy in 
all its dimension is taking place. 
If the development of planning tools progresses further and if the NECP when adopted covers 
all areas of the long-term strategy, including adaptation and the actions in the sectors under 
the EU effort-sharing regime, there may no longer be a need for a separate planning tool like 
the currently foreseen Action Plan to implement the long-term strategy. The NECP may serve 
this purpose.  
The essential prerequisite, however, is that the NECP covers all areas and actions in the Long-
term Strategy and has the objective and the measures which the LCA has provided for the 
Action Plan. 
It must be a cross-sectoral plan which implements the Strategy in its entirety, not only in parts 
or in one sector, is updated as need be, and also provides the corrective actions necessary 
over time. Only then, the Action Plan as foreseen in the LCA can be replaced and the 
necessary amendments to the LCA can be made. The amendments would relate to the 
contents of the NECP, its objectives, and the need to harmonize sectoral planning with the 
NECP.  If  need  be  or  appropriate,  new  institutional  arrangements  for  coordination  and 
cooperation for the harmonisation of the planning tools will be made. 
The MoEPP and the MoE would be in charge to follow these developments and provide the 
adjustments.  Both  Ministries  would  cooperate  with  the  relevant  sectoral  Ministries  and 
institutions. The timing would depend on the further progress of the adoption of the NECP. 
The basic assumption is that the NECP is as comprehensive and functional as the Action Plan 
in the current LCA. 
A-L-11: Adjustment of legal framework to respond to new planning and institutional developments

arrangements for coordination and cooperation between environmental and sectoral planning 
Enabling measures: 
•  Monitor the development and contents of the NECP 
•  Verify if all areas of the long-term strategy are covered and implemented by the NECP 
•  If so, prepare and adopt amendments to the LCA making NECP the planning tool to implement the long-term 
strategy, providing the objectives, functions and contents of the plan necessary for implementation, making new 
provisions on the harmonisation of all relevant planning tools, and where necessary or appropriate provide for 
institutional task and responsibilities.

•  Political commitment, will and support continues for effective climate action 
 
Climate action is a challenging task for governments, and so is legislation to support climate 
action. Legislation is not only complex and multi-sectoral; it is also technically and politically 
complicated and sensitive and requires continuous monitoring with regard to completeness 
and effectiveness, and where evaluation identifies gaps in this regard, adjustment in legislation 
will be needed.  
Monitoring of experiences under current legislation needs to look at the legal framework in its 
entirety, i.e. the Law on Climate Action, the secondary legislation enacted to implement it and 
the relevant sectoral legislation and its respective lye-laws. Monitoring will have to evaluate if 
the legislative objectives are achieved, where constraints appear in practice, if capacities in 
all respects – administrative, human resources, financial – are sufficient or need to be 
improved. It will also be necessary to verify how legislation is implemented in practice and 
throughout business and civil society in order to find out if the level of education, training and 
public awareness at large necessary for effective climate action is reached. To the extent that 
this is not the case, complementary legislative action may need to be considered. 
The main responsibility will be with the MoEPP. For those areas where competences are 
shared, especially with regard to effort-sharing, cooperation and coordination with other, 
sectoral authorities is needed. The lead will, however, be with the MoEPP. The monitoring of 
the implementation in practice, its acceptance by society, businesses and citizens, should start 
with the implementation of the LCA. The monitoring may result in the need of more rules in 
the LCA in order to strengthen implementation, and these rules may also refer to issues such 
as awareness-raising, education, and capacity-building. The rules may also cover financial 
matters for which, however, rules in the LCA would not be sufficient. Specific financial 
instruments would need to be worked out to be included in the relevant sectoral (financial) 
legislation. Here, cooperation with the finance authorities will be essential.

i nsti t uti onal   capaci t y 
The following actions are based on the Action Plan for Administrative Capacity Strengthening 
for Climate Action. For details reference is being made to this Action Plan.17 The Action Plan 
distinguishes between actions of organisational and structural strengthening and actions of 
administrative capacity strengthening. 
The Action Plan recommends actions concerning the organisation and structure of the 
relevant national institutions involved in climate action. The proposed actions cover internal 
reorganisations and inter-institutional relations to ensure the necessary cooperation and 
coordination of authorities and governmental institutions. Cooperation and coordination in 
government will be ensured through the National Council on Climate Change foreseen in the 
LCA and to be established immediately after the adoption of the Law; it is, therefore included 
in the immediate actions above presented in section 3.1. 
The actions for institutional arrangements cover: 
•  Provide institutions with responsibilities in climate action with necessary, qualified staff 
and,  to  the  extent  possible,  a  distinguished  structure for climate  action,  be  it  a 
department or a unit.  
•  Provide  each  of  these  structures  for  climate  action  with  a  clear  mandate  and 
comprehensive, consistent description of tasks and responsibilities, avoiding overlaps 
and conflicts of competences with other structures within the same institution or with 
other institutions.  
•  Ensure that each of these structures for climate action be staffed and equipped with 
the necessary human, financial, and technical resources covering all relevant subject 
matters falling within their competences and functions (policy, regulatory, monitoring, 
reporting, legal, and financial).  
•  Provide  institutions  with  responsibilities  in  climate  action  with  legal  and financial 
support,  through  resources  either  within  their  departments  or  units,  or  through 
mechanisms of cooperation with central governmental structures. 
•  Where tasks in climate action are shared within a particular institution, ensure that 
communication, coordination, and cooperation mechanisms are established. 
•  Ensure that competent authorities have access to scientific expertise, as needed.  
A-L-13: Establishment of organizational capacity in institutions relevant for climate action 
Main objective: Enabling competent governmental institutions to establish the organizational capacity necessary to 
implement climate action 
Enabling measures: 
•  Reorganize, restructure institution for climate action and implementing LCA 
•  Create staff units for climate action 
•  Allocate tasks of climate action to sufficient and qualified staff 
•  Update systematization regulations 
•  Mobilize human, financial and technical resources 
•  Establish cooperation and coordination arrangements between units 
•  Establish cooperation and coordination between institutions in Government

The actions proposed to strengthen administrative capacity through adequate staffing for 
climate action in the various institutions responsible in the area are also based on the Action 
Plan for Administrative Capacity Strengthening mentioned before. That Action Plan identified 
all measures to reach the capacity needed to carry out the climate action tasks in the relevant 
institutions in RN Macedonia. In a second step the capacity strengthening measures needed 
in each institution were identified and proposed over time, with a projection period up to 10 
year, i.e. up to 2030. This second part of the Action Plan is referred to here.

According to the Law on Environment (“Official Gazette of the RN Macedonia” no. 53/2005; 
81/2005; 24/2007; 159/2008; 83/2009; 48/2010; 124/2010; 51/2011; 123/2012; 93/2013;

planning document is obliged to conduct a procedure for assessment of the impact of the 
planning document on the environment, as well as on human life and health. 
The  MoEPP  and  the  Project  have  initiated  the  process  of  development  of  Strategic 
Environmental Assessment (SEA) and the draft assessment was prepared in accordance with 
the Decree on the form and the content of the report on strategic environmental assessment 
(Official Gazette of the RN Macedonia no. 153/2007). 
The SEA of the draft Long-term Strategy on Climate Action made a detailed assessment of 
the environmental impacts of the policies and measures foreseen under the Strategy, which 
provides confidence that the environmental consequences of the measures foreseen under 
the Strategy are identified already at the stage of its preparation and appropriate measures to 
prevent, control and/or compensate the possible adverse impacts are considered already in 
the development phase. The procedure also provides a framework for public debate on the 
consequences, options and obligations, consideration of comments and their involvement in 
decision-making.  
Both scenarios envisage a 23% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 in the WEM 
scenario and a 72% reduction in the WAM scenario compared to 1990 levels. The largest 
percentage of emissions come from the energy sector, a 72% reduction could occur if in this 
sector achieve a reduction of 64% in 2050, compared to 1990. These projections do not 
propose measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the IPPU sector, so the forecasts 
are taken according to the basic regression model, which by 2050 compared to 1990 is 
expected to increase of greenhouse gases by 153%. 
Measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector (energy production, 
industry, private and public buildings) will contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
In  addition  to  reducing  greenhouse  gases,  the  implementation  of  these  measures  and 
activities will contribute to improving the media and the state of the environment and the health 
of the population. 
Additionally, the measures of the Strategy aim at stability in the energy sector, increased 
participation  of  renewable  energy  sources  in  the  energy  sector  for  electricity  and  heat 
production, diversification in the use of energy and improved services in the production and 
supply of electricity and heat. 
In  addition  to  the  benefits  in  terms  of  reducing  greenhouse  gases  and  improving  the 
environmental situation at national level, some of the individual activities envisaged, such as 
the  construction  of  hydropower  plants  or  biogas  plants  and  RES,  may  cause  adverse 
environmental effects and may have negative health effects on the local population. The 
construction of hydropower plants can have an impact on surface water, change in river flow, 
destruction of nature sites, disturbance of soils, landscape, etc. 
The measures envisaged in the sector transport will greatly contribute to improvement of the 
air quality through increased use of rail, electric vehicles, encouraging less use of vehicles 
and promoting sustainable mobility (use of bicycles, walking, etc.). Negative impacts may 
occur during the implementation of the project for construction of the railway to the Republic 
199 
 Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan  
 
of Bulgaria, such as destruction of nature sites, disturbance of soils and landscapes, increased 
noise, destruction of natural goods, etc. 
The activities envisaged for the sector agriculture are mainly related to improved manure 
management which has positive impacts on the environment. However, the Strategy also 
foreseen measures for land use change which may cause negative impacts on the state of 
the environment. The land use change activities can affect biodiversity and certain species 
and they can also cause a change in the soil quality. 
The forestry sector is significant affected from climate change as a result of the rising 
temperatures, reduced rainfalls and changes in seasons resulting in more frequent forest fires 
and changes in forest productivity. Without adaptation measures, the forestry losses will 
continue to grow. The Strategy does not foresee adaptation measures related to the sector 
forestry, since a comprehensive National Adaptation Plan is expected to be developed soon. 
In addition, implementation of some of the planned policies and measures foreseen under the 
energy sector can cause negative impacts to the sector forestry. 
The need for proper waste management in order to protect the environment, and thus mitigate 
the impacts of climate change is inevitable. Reducing the amount of waste as well as recycling 
and reuse of some types will give a positive contribution in that direction. The waste related 
measures proposed in the Strategy aim to reduce air and soil emissions from the waste 
treatment and incineration. Thus, the impacts of the implementation of the waste related 
measures will be mainly positive. 
3. 1. 2  Soci o- economic  im pact 
The Strategy foresees implementation of 64 policies and measures related to mitigation and 
seven policies and measures related to adaptation. It is worth underlining that the investment 
in the adaptation measures are limited because the policies and measures foreseen under the 
Strategy are related to enabling activities for establishment of more comprehensive and 
overarching set of adaptation policies and measures, as foreseen in the forthcoming National 
Adaptation Plan. In addition, This Action Plan contains additional policies and measures 
related  to  enabling  activities,  cross  sectoral  coordination  processes  and  support  of  the 
implementation  of  the  legal  framework  and  strengthening  of  the  institutional  capacities. 
However, most of the investments are foreseen under the mitigation policies and measures. 
The realization of a transition towards low-carbon society in RN Macedonia would require 
approximately 19 Bill. EUR of cumulative capital investments in the period 2020-2050 (WEM 
scenario), while for an enhanced transition (WAM scenario) around 35 Bill. EUR are needed. 
The energy sector (supply and demand side + infrastructure) accounts for about 99% of the 
total investments in both WEM and WAM scenarios. The total cumulative investments in the 
AFOLU sector are about 115 mil. EUR, while the total investments in the waste sector are 
about 67 mil. EUR in both scenarios. It can be noted that the total investments in the WAM 
scenario are almost doubled compared to the WEM scenario. The focus in both scenarios is 
on the capital investments in energy efficiency, followed by investments in RES generation. 
To accept the increased use of RES in the WAM scenario capital investments would be also 
needed in the energy system infrastructure. 
For a sustainable transition, besides the economic and environmental, the social aspect is 
also very important. According to the years in which the proposed measures and policies are 
implemented, for some of them, the number of domestic green jobs is calculated at yearly 
level for the WAM scenario. The highest number of around 10,000 green jobs is achieved in 
2035, which represents 2.7 times more jobs than the current number of employees in the coal 
power plants in RN Macedonia. Retrofitting contributes to the most for the opening of new jobs 
(around 58%), followed by construction of new houses, including passive houses (with around 
19% share). Because of the gradual increase of the standard for renovation and construction 
of new buildings up to 2035, the number of the new green jobs from these measures is 
200 
 Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan  
 
increasing in that period. Additionally, the measures with the highest share are (1) Retrofitting 
of existing residential buildings (50% in 2035), (2) Construction of passive buildings (18% in 
2035), (3) RES without incentives, (4) Solar thermal collectors, (5) Retrofitting of existing 
commercial buildings, and (6) Solar rooftop. Furthermore, it is shown that more than 27% of 
the new domestic green jobs in 2050 can be assigned to women. 
Regarding the socio-economic situation of the population, the following impacts are generally 
expected from the implementation of the Long-term Strategy on Climate Action: 
•  Increased economic pressure as a result of the introduction of new taxes; 
•  Possibility to introduce the concept “prosumers” and to reduce the; 
•  Reduction of product prices as a result of the introduction of energy efficient industrial 
processes; 
•  Better information of the citizens and energy savings by marking the electrical devices; 
•  Greater profitability and development of the private sector through the introduction of EE 
principles in commercial buildings and the work process; 
•  Increasing agricultural yield through improved land management; 
•  Improving the quality of life and living facilities; 
•  Reducing gender inequality and improving the situation of young people; and 
•  Opportunity for urban-rural migration and mitigation of differences in the development of 
the regions. 
In more details, the implementation of the Strategy will mean the closure or modernization of 
coal-fired  power  plants,  investment  in  renewable  sources  and  environmentally  friendly 
technologies,  energy  efficiency,  reduction  of  grid  losses  and  provision  of  a  favorable 
environment and affordable renewable energy prices. 
The two existing thermal power plants that produce electricity are owned by AD Power Plants 
of Northern Macedonia (ESM) and are located in the Polog region. Their closure will mean 
loss of jobs, which will cause a negative impact on local employment and significant socio-
economic effects. According to the Annual Report of AD ESM for 2019, TPP Oslomej and TPP 
Bitola with their mines employ 3588 employees. Some workers will be able to transfer to new 
activities in ESM linked to new energy sources – be it renewables or linked to gas.  
The implementation of climate-related policies and measures will accelerate the recovery of 
investments and activities in key economic sectors such as services, tourism, construction 
and energy, and at the same time create new jobs. The strategy will indirectly contribute to 
the recovery of the economy and the state from the consequences of COVID-19. 
The implementation of the envisaged measures will also generate green jobs and create 
training opportunities in areas including renewable energy, energy efficiency, access to 
energy, improving household resilience, providing the infrastructure needed to support active 
transport and infrastructure, sustainable and resilient sectors, such as forestry, agriculture, 
etc. 
In addition, it is essential to take proactive steps to build climate resilience and to invest in 
adaptation measures, especially for the poorest or most marginalized in society, as well as for 
the sectors most affected by the pandemic. Finally, investing in resilience and capacity building 
is crucial instrument to tackle the adverse effects of climate change and to provide an enabling 
and sustainable environment for economic investment and development.

 Long-term Strategy on Climate Action and Action Plan  
 
3 . 2  For   the   I m pl em e nta ti on  of  the   La w 
The impacts of the draft Law on Climate Action (LCA) were assessment in the Regulatory 
Impact Assessment (RIA) undertaken by the project.18 The main findings on the costs and 
benefits of the LCA can be summarized as follows: 
Economic and social impacts of climate action 
Climate change will have pervasive socio-economic consequences that will not only affect 
major economic sectors such as agriculture, energy or healthcare, but will also result in 
changes to the supply and demand for goods and services of all sectors of the economy, albeit 
with varying levels of intensity. Higher temperatures, sea level rise, and other climatic changes 
(changes in regional precipitation patterns, the water cycle, frequency and intensity of extreme 
weather events), will also impact aspects of life that are not primarily based on or related to 
economic activity, as for example human security, health and well-being, culture, people’s 
capabilities, and environmental quality. 
Mitigation measures reduces the expected level of climate damages (the likely uncertainty 
range reduces damages from 2-10% to 1-3% by 2100 for the selected climate impacts, 
according to the simulations). Furthermore, less ambitious mitigation policies in the first 
decades will have lower short-term costs but lead to higher long-term risks (in quantitative 
terms, this result is heavily influenced by the choice of discount rate).  
Mitigation policies will reduce the negative impacts of climate change on all economic sectors, 
yet the costs of these policies will not be borne by all sectors proportionally to their expected 
benefits. Both damages and the mitigation policy lead to a shift in the structure of the economy 
towards more services. The detailed economic modelling analysis is used to shed further light 
on this, again with a horizon to 2060. 
•  Agriculture,  will  experience  substantial  direct  and  indirect  impacts  from  climate 
damages; its high emissions could imply substantial costs from stringent economy-
wide mitigation policies; 
•  For energy production and the industrial sectors the climate damages are smaller than 
the  potential  effects  from  stringent  economy-wide  mitigation  policies.  Renewable 
power  generation  can  substantially  increase  production  activities  if  an  ambitious 
mitigation policy is implemented, but on balance the negative effects on fossil fuel 
producers outweigh those on renewables; and 
•  Services are projected to benefit from the mitigation policy as they are relatively clean, 
but they are negatively affected by climate damages. However, given the large size of 
services compared to the other sectors, the relative share of the services sectors in 
total GDP can increase, i.e. they are relatively less affected than other sectors.

Compliance costs 
The RIA also assessed the compliance costs for operators in industries whose activities fall 
under the GHG emission permit and monitoring and reporting system (aviation activities were 
left aside for the time being as not applicable). Compliance with the requirements in the LCA 
will lead to administrative activities and to information obligations. 
The LCA provides at this stage for requirements for operators of industrial installations and 
aviation activities to apply for GHG permits (industry) and for approvals of monitoring plans 
(aviation). The LCA also provides for monitoring and reporting obligations of operators in 
industry and aviation. The LCA does not yet foresee the participation in the EU Emission 
Trading System as RN Macedonia is a candidate country and will participate only when a 
member of the EU. The compliance costs therefore cover the costs for the permitting and 
approval procedures and the costs for monitoring and reporting. 
The compliance costs of applying for GHG emission permits for all industrial operators falling 
under the system were estimated at MKD 68.141.140,40. 
The compliance costs of monitoring and reporting for all industrial operators under the system 
were estimated at MKD 2.882.102,40 per monitoring and reporting cycle.

 Long-term Strategy on Climate Action of the RN Macedonia and Action Plan for the first phase of 
implementation of the Strategy and the Law 
 
4.  M ON IT ORI NG  AND  EVALUAT I ON  FR AMEWORK 
The overall objective in the implementation of the Strategy and Law is to support RN Macedonia in 
achieving the long-term goals of climate action, i.e., full transposition and implementation of the EU climate 
acquis, achieving low carbon emissions and climate resilient development. 
The monitoring and the evaluation framework of the Action Plan for the first phase of implementation of 
the Strategy and the Law is supported and enabled by the legal acts prepared by the Project, the Law on 
Climate Action and the Decree on the national inventory system. Moreover, Annex II of the Decree on the 
national inventory system defines the format for reporting on the information on implementation of the 
policies and measures and that format has been used as a template for description and elaboration of the 
Actions foreseen under this Action Plan. 
The CBIT Project implemented by UNDP has recently started to implement an activity for development of 
a digital MRV tool that will support the monitoring and the reporting of the climate action in the country, 
including aspects of policies, measures and projections, climate finance and status of achievements of 
specific objectives. This tool will be designed in a manner to support the monitoring of the implementation 
of the enhanced NDC, as well as the implementation of this specific Action Plan as a primary tool for 
climate action in the country. As defined in Article 57 of the LCA, starting from the year 2025, the country 
will be obliged to report on the implementation of the mitigation policies and measures on a biennial basis, 
and on the implementation of adaptation actins on 4 years. 
The actions defined in this Action Plan contain indicators and quantified objectives for the targeted years, 
so there is no need of defining separate monitoring framework that should support the evaluation of the 
implementation of the Action Plan.
